 I don’t know how to start this. How about i explain what this is that I'm writing. I am writing a journal of sorts, and referendum of my memories. Why you might ask, well to tell you the truth i feel my mind slipping from me. My memories are a low cloud that seems just out of my grasp but i can feel the heavy condensation. My mind is a fog of what is real and what i hope i imagine.

I'm getting ahead of myself here, i better start at the beginning. My name is… wait what is my name? I, i cant, remember. My name is joe, no that's not it, matt, no, Isaiah, no. dammit why can’t i remember. Its on the tip of my brain or tongue, screw it. 

So lets start here, i woke up. It was a day that i don't think i will forget any time soon, but i woke up expecting to see the tv on and light outside but sadly no. i opened my eyes to my room but it was dark, no power but i could see, the street light was still on but i nothing else. I looked at my watch and the hands weren’t moving. I stood up and walked over to the window. As i looked out i saw my street and the light post but everything else was dark, no lights anywhere. I waited for what seemed like hours, i don’t know why just waited. I thought to myself.

“Maybe a power junction was hit by a car or maybe a lightning strike.” i wondered what to do, i had seen many power outages in my life but this was weird, nothing worked and i mean nothing. I decided to go check in with my neighbor jerry, or was it hunter. I got dressed and walked out my front door, just as i smelled the night air i froze solid. Something isn’t right, the air smelled different, tasted different. I couldn’t place it but the air felt old, like when you enter an old building no one has lived in for a long time. I felt goosebumps cover my entire body and i felt as though i was having a panic attack, but i couldn’t move. Then i realized that i couldn’t hear anything. I heard my heart beating it was so quiet, i heard the key in the lock shaking but nothing, no wind, no bugs, no cars, no planes, nothing.

I closed my eyes and steadied myself. Breathing deeply, feeling my chest move up on the inhale and down on the exhale, i focused on my breathing. Finally i felt it pass after what seemed like days, i took the key out of my lock and headed to my neighbor house. I got there and the door was cracked, i knocked.

“Hello?” i knocked again. “Hello, neighbor, anyone home?” i stepped in as the door opened. I didn’t hear anything but my footsteps, i walked to the master bedroom and knocked on the door lightly, “hey guys, sorry i let myself in but the door was open and I…” i stopped dead in my tracks, i couldn’t believe my eyes. I saw in the room nothing. A bottomless pit that never ended, i think that's when my brain broke. 

I ran back outside, thinking the house was going to fall out from under me. I ran down the hall passed the living room and out of the open front door, i jumped off the the porch so far, olympic jumpers would have been jealous. I don’t know it felt far for me, i turned expecting to see the house crumble or fall or blow up but nothing. Nothing happened.

“What the fuck?” i whispered, i wanted to scream but it was too quiet and i couldn’t. I paced the front lawn for a while looking at the house but i couldn’t figure it out. I had never been in their room before but i didn’t expect them not to have one at all, let alone a pit to hell. I stopped and gathered my thoughts. “Okay, maybe it a dream, maybe im dreaming, yea i must be dreaming.” i said all of this out loud by the way. “Maybe im having the worst dream ever, does that mean im lucid dreaming now, am i dreaming?” then i started thinking about the fact i had an panic attack, then the thought occurred to me. “Can you have a panic attack in a dream, is that even possible.” just then i froze again. Not because of the thought but because i heard what sounded like a twig breaking in the distance. I don’t move a muscle but my eyes, i look around, the sound come from my left, to my left was my house and i don’t have any trees or bushes in my yard. There are no twigs in my yard at all. 

I slowly look over to my left and i don’t see my house, i see the woods. My eyes widen and i take a step back and slam into a tree that wasn’t there a second ago
