I see him everywhere.

&#x200B;

The TV always was on.

From when i bathed in the warm glow of our CRT TV,

To the Plasma Screens, flat screens, V TVs, LED TVs and now the Smart TVs.

&#x200B;

The TV was always on.

&#x200B;

Whether it was Tobey Maguire learning his newly found Spidey skills or Leonardo pretending to be a school teacher.

&#x200B;

I was always warned that it would make a mush out of my brain in my hollow skull.

&#x200B;

But i couldn't find any other way to trick myself into falling asleep.

&#x200B;

The colourful palette of channels like Nick TV running shoes like Drake and Josh, or Neds declassified something something would never work.

&#x200B;

Slower shows like Bones and Monk those were my Grade A sleeping pills.

&#x200B;

But recently things have gotten worse at my job.

With so many lay offs, the only part of my day i have to look forward to, is to slump in my sofa and watch whatever's on, on TV.

&#x200B;

The Laugh track of shows like How I met your Mother, and The Big Bang Theory keep me company as I prepare my cup-a-noodles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn't much, but it was a routine i was used to.

&#x200B;

And then the day finally came.

&#x200B;

I remember the distinct classical jingle of Its Always Sunny in Philly playing in the background when i got the call, i had to lower the volume finding it difficult to hear over Charlie Day yelling.

&#x200B;

I was fired.

&#x200B;

They said it was because our boss was caught doing some shit with the company money, i never understood all that commerce mumbo jumbo.

&#x200B;

I knew a little about greedy sleazy CEOs from Arrested development, but the thought of looking for a new job as a Janitor at my age was all i worried about.

&#x200B;

And that's when i gave up, i bought packs of some random beer from the grocery near my home.

&#x200B;

It's almost  a week now, i feel a sharp pain in my chest, on the right side.

&#x200B;

It's not the left side, so at least it's not my heart.

&#x200B;

Everything is cloudy, my head hurts, my eyes hurt, and i have this bitter taste in my mouth at all times.

&#x200B;

In this mess that i was in it it was the first time i saw him.

&#x200B;

He wasn't standing outside my window.

He wasn't at my door.

&#x200B;

I saw him, at the one place i had been starting at for this one week now, my TV.

&#x200B;

He didnt carry a sickle or scythe.

Nor did he wear a hooded black robe.

&#x200B;

Skull-like facial features? 

&#x200B;

No.

That would be too obvious.

How then, would he hide in plane view.

&#x200B;

I was watching NCIS and i saw him, i changed channels and saw him in a re run of Entourage. Changed the channel again... And there he was in the O bloody C.

&#x200B;

I flicked through channels as quickly as i could

&#x200B;

Going through...

&#x200B;

My Name is Earl

&#x200B;

Some show about a kid name Charlie

&#x200B;

Reno 911!

&#x200B;

Even Glee!

&#x200B;

He was everywhere.

&#x200B;

I stopped.

Took a good look at his face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He seemed familiar, as though he had been watching me all my life and maybe i had caught a glimpse or two of him.

&#x200B;

Did i know him?

&#x200B;

Maybe go to the movie channels.

&#x200B;

The Shaggy dog was going on, he can't possibly be here too. And then there he was.

&#x200B;

I again to no avail flicked through the movie channels...

&#x200B;

17 Again

&#x200B;

Forgetting Sarah Marshall

&#x200B;

Austin Powers in Goldmember

&#x200B;

He was everywhere.

&#x200B;

I gave one last try, i had to check out NBC perhaps for a re run of The Office.

&#x200B;

Parks and rec was going on, i guess that was okay.

&#x200B;

But there he was, i got closer.

I could see the metallic sheen from his curled lips as he quenched his thirst.

&#x200B;

The vessels underneath, they perhaps ran ice cold, with freckles that splotched, that blemished, his pale skin.

&#x200B;

I got closer to the TV.

&#x200B;

Now maybe, an inch from my TV, i could see myself staring back at me from the reflection on the glasses that sat on his face. 

&#x200B;

Or was it just from the TV.

&#x200B;

Then the TV turned off.

&#x200B;

Nothing.

No sound.

&#x200B;

And then it came on again.

&#x200B;

And there was only one line.

&#x200B;

Special appearance by

&#x200B;

And i couldn't read the rest.

&#x200B;

Darkness suddenly falls over me.

I hear loud banging on my window.

&#x200B;

I look at my window as I sit in the dark of his shadow and i see him, i look back at the TV.

&#x200B;

Yes. He had made another appearance just for me.
