***Part 1 summary:*** *I'm a widower who found a child's backpack while walking my dog, Saskia. An address on the pack led me to Lamorne Way, a quiet neighborhood street. But neither the house nor the boy the backpack belonged to seemed to exist. I gave the pack to a neighborhood couple. I thought I'd never see it again, but it inexplicably reappeared outside my bedroom door. The couple I gave the bag to accused me of stalking them after cryptic crayon drawings appeared in their home. I decided to perform research on the bag and drawings, leading me to the dark web...*

Dawn had broken by the time I figured out the TOR browser and navigated to the URL. I was greeted by a spare forum website, headed with white text on a black background: "The Never Missing Children - Artifacts and Discussion." The first board within was titled "Read Me - Background, Rules, and Safety," the next 'Artifact Certification,' and then 'Timeline.' Those three were pinned to the top. I scrolled down until I was gripped by a gasping shiver. A board simply titled "Luis." Just beneath, "Tiffany." A few more down, "Ming." They were situated among five similarly titled boards: "Aboubakar," "Bilal," "Marcel," "Siobhan," and "Xander." Beneath those: "Unnamed Boy," "Unnamed Girl 1," and "Unnamed Girl 2 (confirmed)." The rest of the board was filled with esoteric titles like "Theological/Theodical Implications," "Numerology - 11 and beyond, etc.," and "TMNC Artifacts and Fidelity to the 'Event' - Appearing the Void."

I pasted the text from some of the boards into a doc that morning. As far as I know, the below is the only remaining evidence of the forum.

From the "Read Me" board:

If you believe you are a "witness" as described below, DO NOT provide personal information on any board within this forum. Follow the instructions in the "Artifact Certification" board to submit artifacts for community certification.

**Background:** The "Never Missing Children Artifacts" refers to evidence suggesting the kidnapping or murder of at least 11 unrelated children collected from all over the world since roughly 1994. Despite this evidence, there are no official records that any such crimes have occurred or that the victims existed. All known artifacts have been revealed to individuals referred to in this forum as "witnesses." Decades of research shared across various iterations of this forum dispel the notion that the artifacts are part of a hoax. The forum is dedicated to the study and discussion of the meaning of these artifacts, suggesting the existence of The Never Missing Children (TNMC).

**Rules & Safety**: Any users or visitors found in violation of these rules will be permanently banned from TNMC Artifacts.

1. Obey board-specific rules at all times. Relevant moderators are identified at the top of each board.
2. Constructive discussions only. Zero tolerance for harassment or doxing.
3. Do not share personally identifiable information.
4. Do not share forum content outside of the forum.
5. All artifacts and evidence thereof must be certified before they are shared within the forum. Do not post or discuss uncertified artifacts anywhere.
6. Do not attempt to certify false artifacts.
7. Do not hold yourself out as a "witness" until an artifact revealed to you has been certified.
8. All posts must be relevant to the board's subject matter. You may post new boards or threads, but they must be on topic and otherwise meet the requirements above. Content that does not meet these requirements will be removed by the moderators.

I couldn’t believe what I’d read. “…at least 11 unrelated children collected from all over the world since roughly 1994.” Did that mean some version of what was happening to me had been going on for over 30 years? Was I a “witness”? Was I, therefore, in some kind of danger? I’d come to learn the answer to all of the above was “yes.”

The "Artifact Certification" board was dry and in the weeds, so I won't bore you with it other than to say certification required, at a minimum, multiple photographs, consultation with a handwriting expert, and spectrophotometry.

The “Timeline” board presented a literal, vertical timeline. It was incredibly detailed and comprehensive, so I'll just share the beginning to provide a flavor:

\_

**Summer 1994, Kitchener, Ontario** \-  jumper artifact of “Unnamed Girl #1” revealed to Witness Alpha, a local Nurse. Jumper has a stitched emblem for ‘Our Lady of Pity.’ No school with that name exists within 500 miles of that location. No school using that name required girl’s uniforms resembling the jumper. Original drawing artifacts revealed to Witness Alpha, including the first mentions of “Marcel” and "Siobhan."

**January 1995, Dakar, Senegal** \- Witness Beta, a Japanese businessman visiting for the end of the Dakar Rally, found a Pinewood Derby-style wooden car with a Louveteaux/Association des Scouts et Guides du Sénégal sticker and the name “Aboubakar Touré” carved into it. No nearby confederated scouting organizations had that name registered, nor had any recently held that kind of event.

**Spring 1995, Sapporo, Japan** \- Drawing artifacts revealed to Witness Beta. First mention of "Bilal." First appearance of the dark mass.

**July 1995, Salto, Uruguay** \- the soccer trophy artifact with the name “Luís Vizcarra” was revealed to Witness Gamma, an accountant. No boy with that name played for the team identified, and the trophy category “8 and under” did not exist. Revealed drawings include the first appearance of Unnamed Boy and the second mention of "Marcel."

**October 1997, Drumcondra, Dublin, Ireland** \- the Big Wheel artifact, labeled with the name "Siobhan" and an address revealed to Witness Delta, a computer programmer. The street name and Eircode did not exist.

**Winter 1997/1998, Ireland** \- Drawing artifacts revealed to Witness Delta. First mentions of Ming and Xander.

**February 1998, Slashdot Board** \- Witness Delta posts about the artifacts revealed to her. First known documentation of TNMC. Many replies, but nothing substantive for years.

**May 2001, Islamabad, Pakistan** \- Topi artifact with the name "Bilal Rizvi" was revealed to Witness Epsilon, a teacher. The style of the Topi was unique to the uniform of a particular school, but no student by that name attended.

**August 2002, Kitchener, Ontario** \- Witness Alpha commits suicide by hanging. His body was discovered by his fiancé, a librarian. The jumper artifact and drawings were beneath his feet.

**September 2002, Slashdot Board** \- Witness Alpha's fiancé replied to the 1998 posting by Witness Delta.

**Fall 2002** \- Witness Alpha's fiancé and Witness Delta (Original Mods) corresponded and developed the original TNMC GeoCities site. “The Never Missing Children” was taken from the journal of Witness Alpha, who had written “…my life is consumed by an illogical terror for these non-existent victims…these never-missing children.” They developed the original artifact certification protocol.

**December 2005** \- the daughter of Witness Beta found the GeoCities site during a semester abroad in Australia. She contacted Original Mods and successfully certified the Aboubakar artifacts. Witness Beta remained alive at that point, but his mental health had deteriorated in the years since the Aboubakar artifact was revealed to him.

\_

The timeline continued through the present. To summarize, more artifacts were revealed to more witnesses. The witnesses or relations thereof found the GeoCities site or one of its successors. Around 2010, something happened to Witness Delta, one of the Original Mods, at which point TMNC's online presence vanished. It was later reconstituted across various forums, with the largest three each vying to be the "official" TMNC forum. Eventually, r/NeverMissingChildren won out.

The timeline didn't dwell on the disappearance of Witness Delta, but implied that she met with foul play, potentially at the hands of an unwell follower of TNMC. This was a troubling theme throughout. The life of a Witness post-revelation seemed to correlate with a higher than average likelihood of death by suicide or suffering harassment and violence at the hands of obsessives. The latter was the reason the group nuked its Reddit presence six years prior. The Read Me's warnings about revealing personal information had come into sharp relief by the time I finished reading the timeline.

One of the most recent entries in the timeline referred to an 'artifact audit' in 2021. This resulted in a reduction of recognized NMCs from the mid-20s to 11, 8 named and 3 unnamed. Of the 8 names, none were 'Charlie.' For a moment, a drop of GABA diluted the lake of cortisol my brain was drowning in. I held out hope that I was not a 'Witness' and the backpack wasn't a real 'artifact.' Perhaps this was a strange and cruel prank orchestrated by someone from the forum. Maybe the couple from Lamorne? Maybe some bored kids from the neighborhood with an Onion browser and too much free time. That was still plenty frightening, considering how far things had gone already, but it was frightening in a familiar, tractable way. There was a modicum of hope in that.

I knew even before entering the board titled 'Unnamed Boy,' all hope would be eviscerated. I just didn't know how quickly. An image was pinned to the top, captioned 'Artifact # Gamma--1995-003. Salto, Uruguay.' It was a drawing of the playground on Lamorne Way. Charlie, in his red shirt, stands in the foreground smiling. Back and to the left, two figures, one tall with brown hair, the other short with blond hair, walking a big dog with a green collar. Back and to the right, another figure walking a little dog with a blue collar. The latter was me and Sas, depicted in a drawing posted to the board five years ago and discovered twenty-five years before that in a city thousands of miles away. A city I've never visited. I slammed the laptop shut.

When I wrote '...now my life is ruined' in the title of this post, I had this 'now' in mind. Many further horrors had yet to befall me, and life would become immeasurably worse than it was that bleary-eyed morning, but nothing to come would match the impact of that drawing. It leveled every scaffold and buttress that secured my personhood. Each common-sense prior, each rationalist piety I'd absorbed and held dear for a lifetime, scattered from me like dandelion spores. The orderly but indifferent world I thought I'd inhabited as an undetermined free agent transmogrified to a cacophonous and malevolent hallucination in which I am a hapless pawn. Whatever hope I'd had for my life was ruined. Whatever I'd thought 'life' meant was altered irrevocably.

My laptop remained off and in a closet for a week. I tried to banish the backpack and the Never Missing Children from my thoughts. For a few moments here and there, I even succeeded. No matter what I did, though, the uncanny valley separating life before and life after finding the backpack and the forum remained. Widened. Like Capgras Syndrome, extended to everything. Only Sas felt in continuity with the past. My final tether to sanity.

My work suffered. To be frank, I hadn't been in the running for employee of the year since our fertility troubles eons ago, but my transitions to widower and now to tin-foil hatter each diminished my productivity by an order of magnitude. I spent one day at the office trying to determine whether I would have enough money between savings and severance to take care of Sas for the rest of her life if I were fired. I spent the balance of another staring at a question that I typed in an email to no one: "*In* this world, but not *of* it OR *of* this world, but not *in* it?' Mostly, I just performed busyness theater and kept my fingers crossed that life would begin to imitate art before HR came calling.

It didn't. The call came on a Friday afternoon. One of the newer HR specialists, the one who looked like his mom dressed him every morning for work, instructed me to meet him in a conference room. Though I'd done next to nothing of value for an indeterminate period, it surprised they came for me when they did. I thought I had more rope left to hang myself.

In the conference room, the manchild who summoned me sat beside his boss, the fearsome HR director. She did not stand to greet me but kept her attention on the stack of papers on the table before her. I sat down, resigned to the fact that I would likely be led out of the room by security.

To my surprise, the meeting wasn't about my lack of output and increase in absenteeism. Rather, the HR Director informed me that there was an online campaign against the company for employing me. She slid me a series of printouts aggregating postings from various websites accusing the company of employing a man who had stalked and threatened a homosexual couple. Another printout included an online petition to boycott the company while I remained employed. She informed me that the company had a zero-tolerance policy for employees engaging in discriminatory or hateful behavior, inside or outside of work.

I protested that I had not done any such thing. I didn't dare go into the backpack or The Never Missing Children, but I mentioned that I was aware that a couple I'd met one time was under the misapprehension that I'd been harassing them by leaving strange drawings in their home. She shot an exasperated look at her underling. I clammed up, realizing they were trying to fire me for cause rather than performance. No severance. No unemployment. I didn't feel so resigned anymore.

After a very pregnant pause, she informed me that the company would be placing me on administrative leave pending further investigation of the circumstances. Immediate relief. Whatever they had on me, they knew it wasn't solid enough to prevent me from coming back at them for wrongful termination. I'd lived to fight another day and would get a paid vacation in the meantime.

The HR kid walked me back to my desk instead of security. En route, he informed me that I was to transfer all of my working files to a folder on a shared drive, then depart. He explained that I didn't need to pack up my desk, but advised taking any personal property with me when I departed that day. I did as he asked, grabbed the single picture of my wife I had stashed in a desk drawer, and walked out of the building.

I picked up Sas from doggy daycare and cancelled all future reservations. We celebrated the beginning of our unexpected staycation with a pint of ice cream and a pup-cup. I hadn't even reached the bottom of the pint before the novelty of my indeterminate Saturday wore off. I never liked my job, but the ritual of attending work, however half-heartedly I approached it, had been an important distraction. First from the succession of unsuccessful fertility treatments, then from the death of my wife, and now from the backpack. I laughed bitterly, thinking of all the time I'd spent working a job I despised to support a life I loathed even more.

I endeavored to fill those empty, endless days with books and records and exercise. Reorganizing and decluttering. Revising myself to be the person I always thought I should be. Instead, I watched television, ate garbage, and only pried myself from the indentation I'd made in the couch when Sas demanded it. Since the accident, I'd relied on Sas's wiry energy for the motivation to keep going. The weight of carrying me had taken its toll. Her joie de vivre faded a little more each day. If dogs are a reflection of their owners, her transition from being my wife's to mine was near completion. I knew I'd let her down. I knew I should re-home her. She deserved a family that would love her to pieces, playing with her until she was a panting puddle on the floor. She deserved better than me, but she didn't get it.

My exile from work stretched on for months. I kept expecting a call, a letter -*something*\- informing me I'd been fired. But nothing came. Perhaps they were weighing the cost of keeping me in limbo versus dealing with a wrongful termination lawsuit, though even I really didn't think they'd be wrong to terminate me. I tried to spend as much time as possible unconscious. I worked my way up to 13 hours of sleep per day. I dreamt of the toy car in Senegal and the dangling feet of Witness Alpha. Of Lamorne Way and the missing house. Of the absolute blackness at the threshold of my bedroom, the night the backpack returned. The laptop taunted me every waking moment, beckoning me back to the forum. Somehow, I resisted. Not that it mattered.

It started with a whimper. On a clear spring morning, trotting happily down the path connecting my building with the modest strip mall with the grocery store that sold liquor before noon, Sas came to a sudden halt. She gave the kind of low, slow whimper that normally meant something like 'more food' or 'your food, please.' She sat down and began panting. I asked her what was wrong, examining her for a foot irritation or a hot spot I hadn't noticed. She withdrew from my touch, walking for a moment in a tight circle.

The wind picked up, shaking the trees around us, agitating her further. She whimpered again, more urgently. My pulse quickened. Anxious queasiness stormed through my guts. I thought she might be on the verge of another seizure. Her whimpers escalated to a yelping screech, audible even as the wind reached a howl. She coughed violently as she spun herself in circles. I moved to pick her up, to run her to my car, to get her to the vet. Before I could, the sun vanished from the cloudless sky. The wind stopped. There was only the dark, my pounding heart, and Sas's agonized shrieking.

I fumbled for my phone, dropping it in the dark. I heard it thump on the asphalt, accompanied by the dull crunch of broken glass. I begged for Sas to come toward the sound of my voice as I crawled on the ground, feeling for a rectangular form. Sas's screams were interrupted by violent, wet heaving, as if everything in her stomach was forced to evacuate in an instant. I could hear the jingling of her collar scraping the ground. Finally feeling my phone, I pressed the flashlight icon on the shattered lock screen and waved the beam wildly to find Sas.

She lay on her side in an expanding pool of bloody feces and bilious vomit, shaking and retching, eyes bulging. Her stomach had swelled to double its normal size. I picked myself up and ran to her. When I attempted to swoop her into my arms, she let out a blood-curdling howl. I laid her back in the putrid puddle, pleading with her to let me take her to the car. I realized I wasn't at all sure whether the car or the world I drove it through still existed. The only things that were real and present were Sas's pain and my panic.

Sas's belly looked on the verge of popping. She writhed in her own vomit and excrement. The sound of her cries gave way to violent gagging. The bulge in her stomach moved to her ribs. I could hear them snap individually as it moved through. The mass caught in her throat. She let out a last choking retch before her jaw came loose from its sockets. She then lay still. Quiet. Stiff. Her head and neck unnaturally elongated.

As I cried her name in hopes of eliciting some sign of life, the world restarted. The sun burned again. Sas’s eyes did not react.  A saturated wad of material jutted out from her distended jaw. I could make out a dark gray fabric loop attached to a larger mass. I pulled on the loop. I raised Sas's lifeless body almost totally off the ground before the material lodged in her throat gave another inch. When it did, I let her back down and collapsed, screaming, onto the asphalt.

The clump of fabric extending from her throat had a plastic pocket with a yellowed paper address card inside that read “15707 Lamorne Way.”
