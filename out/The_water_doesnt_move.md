“Quit being such a bitch and jump in” 
My brother looks at me with a worried look from the boat. This is the first time i’ve taken him out to the lake so i can understand his hesitation. “Dude if you don’t just jump in, I’ll pull you in!” Steven remains firmly planted holding both sides of the rocking boat. “Its really deep, You don’t know whats down there.” His fear is written on his face like a neon sign in a desolate town. “Steven i’ve been out here countless times it’s safe, I promise.” Steven opens his mouth like he’s about to say something but quickly resigns.
“Steven i wouldn’t bring you out here if i didn’t think it was safe.” He shudders. “But this is where Samantha drowned.” His fear quickly transitions into a look of sorrow. “Steven that was an accident, everyone knows it.” I reassure him, hoping to ease his nerves and help him relax.
 
“Alright fine we can wait a little” I was annoyed but didn’t want to rush him and have another accident. Our family has been through enough. I climb into the boat bringing the cold water into the vessel with me. I shake like a dog both to annoy my younger brother and dry myself off. “What the hell!” Steven shoots daggers at me but then smiles and lets out a little chuckle. “Thanks for taking me out here, Its been awhile since we’ve done something together.” I smile and pat him on his shoulder “So are we gonna fish or what?” i pulled out the rods with excitement and Steven seemed to be excited as well. He grabbed one. Then picked up the can of worms and began hooking them. We casted our rods out on opposite sides to avoid tangling our casts. “Do you ever think about her?” Steven asked me, breaking a silence that went on for way too long. “Samantha?” I asked. “Sure, Yeah. I think about Samantha all the time, She was the one that taught me how to swim and drive a boat.”
I try to hide the expression on my face. 
“Hey listen, it’s starting to get dark we should probably-“ “Hey look!” Steven shouts like he’d seen something coming out from the water and lunging at him. 

I look over the boat at where his eyes are fixed. A small to medium sized black object floats there. Motionless. Unaffected by the ripples in the water. “It’s just a fish, come on we should pack up.” Steven does not move. “Steven! Come on.” Steven remains. His eyes never leaving the black object. I let out an annoyed sigh “Fuck this, i’m driving back to shore. Better reel your line in or say bye to that catch.” Steven lets out a soft whimper. I see tears welling up in his eyes. His breathing becomes a little more intense.
“It’s a girl.” Steven quietly whispers. “she needs my help.” I turn around and Steven is standing now. How did i not feel him move the boat. Steven leans over the edge. Again not the slightest movement of the boat. “Steven stop! There’s something wrong here. Please, just let it go.” I turn around to look at Steven but he’s gone. Vanished. Not a word. Not a sound. “Fuck! He must of fell in.” I can feel my heart banging out of my chest. I bolt to where he was standing and i look over the edge. “What the fuck.” There was no wake. No waves. No ripples. Nothing. The water seemed as if it was a flat surface of glass that was expertly cleaned and polished every night. It seemed impossible. Surely this was impossible. I look over the edge. There. I see it now. 

A medium sized black object. Almost the size of Teenage girl. I know now. I can see it. Her finger reach out from the cold depths of the ever still lake. not as much as a sound or a ripple. Her hands are long and badly decayed but in some spots as beautiful as when they were alive. Her nails are fresh. She had just had them done. Her cold wet hands wrap around my neck. I feel scared. Im not ready. “Samantha. please.” Her cold naked body floats from the still confines of the lake. Still as beautiful as the day she died. “Samantha, it was an accident.” I can feel my life slipping away from me. My breath shallows. Im seeing her again. In her full beauty. “Oh god I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to. God please!” I reach out to grab her but feel nothing there. My vision becomes blurry and dark. I can’t make any noise. My throat is closed. Crushed by the weight of her unnatural strength. So this. This is what she felt on that day when i took her out here. 

The cold water hits my back with a solid slap sending a sharp pain up and down by spine. The water has never felt this cold. The hold on my throat tightens. I can still see her. Following me down. I almost feel sorry for her. Sorry for the pain i caused her those few years ago. We sink lower and lower, The light of the surface. The warmth fades away as i’m dragged deeper into the eternal darkness of the deep lake. Again i am alone. Unable to breathe but still awake. I cannot move but i see things pass. Schools of fish. The occasional fishing lure. I reach but cannot physically move. I am alone.
