I never thought that a routine job of picking up a package would turn into a nightmare.


It was my job to ensure that every pick up and drop off went smoothly. Little did I know that this pick up at a  cabin in the Catskills would be the thing to scare me out of an enjoyable life of crime.


Me, Vic, Jimmy, Tommy and Johnny arrived at the cabin in the dead of night. I'm definitely not a damn fan of the woods, but here we are. We hopped out armed to the teeth, and ready to get the package from this new connection. 


"Hey Tone, who the fuck made this the place  to meet up?" Johnny spoke up as we got closer. " Listen, this is where the boss told us to meet the guy, so just shut up and watch our asses" I said back to him. There was a thick fog as we got closer to the cabin. Our footsteps were muffled because of the fallen leaves. "This is one creepy ass place" Tommy said as we stepped onto the porch.
 

I reached out and banged on the door. " Hey yo, It's Tony, I'm here for the pick up" I yelled at whoever had the candle burning in the window. No one answered.


 "Jimmy, Vic, go around the sides and look in the windows, Tommy, you go around the back. We ain't leaving here without that package. Hey you prick! open the fucking door" I yelled banging again.


 A loud fucking howl broke the quiet, followed by more howls that echoed through the woods. "What the fuck was that!?" Tommy said running around from the back of the house. "You think it's one of those bigfoots?" Vic asked while pointing his gun at the trees. "Bigfoot ain't real dumbass" Jimmy said, " we're in the fuckin' mountains, it's probably just coyotes or some shit."

 
I pulled out the keys and chirped the alarm. Something was standing behind the car and took off when the lights came on. "I know you saw that shit Tony!" Vic said nervously. "It's gotta be the guy messing' with us. These rednecks are crazy as hell up here" Tommy said leaning his back up against the wall. "I'm not liking this Tone, not one bit" Jimmy spoke up while checking to see if he had a round chambered. 


"Aight fellas, let's go. I'll make a call and have this dickhead dealt with" I told the rest of the guys. I made the first move towards the car with Vic behind me, then Tommy, Johnny and Jimmy.


"Let go you motherfu..." We heard Jimmy scream. We turned around to see a massive clawed hand hanging from the roof.  Jimmy's entire head in the palm. Jimmy was grabbing at the giant fingers, trying to pry the claw off his head. "JESUS!!"  Johnny yelled stumbling backwards. Vic pulled his pistol and started popping shells off. One of the shots hit Jimmy in the leg causing him to scream even louder. Another round hit the thing in the forearm. When the round hit, it let out a howl and yanked Jimmy into the air. There was a wet tearing sound, then Jimmy's body dropped back to the ground headless.


 "HOLY FUCKIN' SHIT" Tommy screamed when Jimmy's body hit the ground splattering blood all over him. "Get to the fuckin' car now!!" I yelled taking steps backwards away from the headless body. There was another long howl and Johnny took off towards the car. He fell to the ground after something hit the roof of the car. It was Jimmy's head, part of the spine still hanging out.
 

I could hear a bunch of shit moving around in the woods over Johnny's scream. Tommy was helping him up when there was a deep growl from a lil' ways away. I opened the car door and turned on the headlights. The lights caught something huge and hairy standing on the porch. "What the fuck is that?" Vic yelled pointing. "No god damn way!!" I answered back.


The things head was the size of a truck tire. It had a huge snout with sharp ass teeth that dripped blood and spit. It was standing eight feet tall and was built like fucking Ray Lewis. It's eyes glowed bright red in the light. "Oh hell no" Tommy said in a shaky voice, "That's a fucking werewolf!!"


While we were standing there pissing ourselves, we didn't notice we were being surrounded. We had a whole damn pack of these things around us now, their eyes glowing red. They were snapping and growling at each other. The one on the porch howled again, that's when shit hit the fan.

 
They started moving in and Vic lost it. "Fuck this!!" He yelled out and starting shooting. All hell broke loose. Gunshots rang out, But they were being drowned out by the loud growls and snarls as they moved in closer.


We were all shooting now, firing in every direction. The one on the porch took a step and jumped onto the top of the car, crushing it like a damn can. Vic fell to the ground and started screaming. While he was on the ground, something pulled him under the car.  Johnny had managed to get into the car and lock the fucking doors. "Open the fucking doors!!" Tommy said banging on the window. Johnny just tucked himself down in between the seats. I took off running towards the cabin. I hit the door like it owed me money. It swung open and I ran inside. There was a couch on the wall next to the door. I slid it over to block the door, then peaked out of the window to see Tommy being torn apart and Johnny being ripped out of the car.


I turned around to see stacks of chewed up bodies all over the fucking place. The walls were covered in claw marks and blood, "This ain't good" I mumbled to myself. I needed a place to hide. I ran towards the back of the cabin, just more decaying bodies.


There was a door next to woman's body that was missing both arms. It was the basement, and smelled like a hundred years worth of rotting meat. I had no choice, I buried myself under the corpses.


Before digging myself in I checked my gun, one round left. I hid there while those fucking things ate my crew. I could hear them walking around up there, growling. I knew they were looking for me but couldn't find me, the stench of blood and meat must have thrown them off. After a few hours I couldn't hear anything else. I climbed out from the bodies and slowly made my way back up the stairs.


There were way more bodies than I figured. "They must've been doing this shit a long time" I thought to myself while stepping over an arm that still had a pistol in the hand. There was no sign of them as I walked out the door. The doors and roof were ripped off of the car. Pools of blood and little pieces of flesh were everywhere.
 

I walked my ass back down the trail to the main road. I called an old cop who'd been on my take for years and had him come pick me up. About an hour later Omally showed up. "What the fuck happened to you?" He asked getting out of the car. "Shut up and get back in the car, we have a stop to make" I told him grabbing the door handle.


A little while later we pulled up to Costello's. "Wait here" I said getting out of the car. I guess they weren't expecting to see me, because no one said a fucking thing as I walked towards the back office.


I knocked on the door twice and a voice answered from the other side. "Come in" it responded. I opened the door slowly with my gun raised. "You sent us out there, you rat fuck!!" I screamed putting the gun in Vincent's face. "Fuck you, those other pricks had it coming. They were stealing money, MY MONEY. I couldn't let that stand. The family has been using that area for years to get rid of... problems, just bad luck you were there. "Your a real prick" I said before shooting him in throat. I walked over to him while he held the gaping hole in his neck. "That's for my guys you cocksucker," I said real close to his ear.
 

I walked right back out the front door to O'mally waiting in the car. We need to make one more stop.


"I had him bring me here and sign me in. Been here for a couple of months now. Thick walls, bars, and armed security. This is the safest spot I can think of outside of being in jail" I said to the new orderly working my wing of the puzzle factory.
 

"That is a pretty interesting story Mr. Sarello, now please... take your meds" Matthew said sliding the pill cup and water over to me.
 

"No problem" I said putting the pills in my mouth then drinking the water. "I'll be in the T.V. room, bring my pudding down there."
