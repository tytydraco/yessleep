My fiancé (F26) and I (M27) are on a weekend getaway in this old wooden cabin we rented in a rural village 1.5 hour away from the city we both live in. We were both really busy lately and we finally took the time to spend a couple of days together alone and decided this was the best place if any. We rented the cabin on Booking and came here on Friday (yesterday) evening. We were both super excited when we saw it since the cabin is literally in the middle of nowhere, on the end of an old country road. The first houses are like five minutes away by foot. Upon arrival we were greeted by the host, an old lady who lives in of those above-mentioned houses. She showed us the cabin and handed us the keys. Before we arrived, she warmed the house for us by starting the fire in the furnace. Upon leaving she casually warned us that it is better to keep the lights on outside at night. When we asked why, she replied that it's better that it is showing that someone is inside. We didn't give it much thought and spent a wonderful night together. However the lights outside stopped working after the first couple of hours which we thought was funny but a little scary too. Today we were visiting the beautiful landscape of the countryside known for its rivers and waterfalls where two century old mills were put up almost as barriers seemingly trying to control what can't be tamed. 

When we got back from our trip, we were both feeling really sleepy and decided to take an afternoon nap. I noticed that there wasn't plenty of wood left in the cabin and was thinking to bring more from the shack when it's still daylight but I decided I will get it after we wake up. When we woke up we had coffee and I decided it's time to start the fire since the nights are very cold in this parts even in the summer. My fiancé was scrolling on her phone on the kitchen bench when I went out to get the wood. The shack is located at the back of the cabin and it took me less then two minutes to get back inside. When I got back inside I started the fire which took me a couple of minutes to do. When I turned around I noticed my fiancé wasn't on the bench anymore. I laughed and stared to look for her since we love to prank each other by one of us suddenly disappearing. I searched everywhere inside the house and she wasn't there. I slowly started to panic I would have surely heard her opening the cabin door and leaving outside since the door gives a loud, long shrinking sound when it opens. Also, I was sure she was on the bench when I came back. I tried calling her and I keep calling her since her phone wasn't on the kitchen table but she isn't answering. When I first called her she I could see she picked up but since I didn't look at my phone I already eneded the conversation before I could stop myself. Afterwards she never picked up again.

It's been an hour now and she is still missing. I don't know what to do, I am slowly starting to think to call the police, but I still don't if she is pulling a prank on me. However while I was in panic checking to see whether she was maybe online on Instagram I noticed she posted a couple of strange photos earlier after we got back to the cabin. The photos are in a dark tone showing the countryside we visited and what's really strange is that on one of the photos she is shown looking back at the camera. I can't explain this since it shows her on a location we were at earlier today but it definitely wasn't me who took it. I don't know what to and out of desperation I'm writing this post hoping someone will explain everything while also hoping she will return when she notices it's not funny anymore. Also I just can't shake the thought that I wanted to get the wood earlier, but didn't because I was tired. 

Please someone help me, I'm not feeling well. This is one of the photos she posted on Instagram
