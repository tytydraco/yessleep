“The weather is feeling fantastic today.” I say to my wife Anna as I head out into the backyard to do some yard work on this peaceful Saturday morning in October. “Also I forgot you work today, love you and have a great day.” I exclaim just before closing the screen door. 

Saturdays have always been my favourite day of the week and especially the mornings of them. Waking up to that noise of bacon sizzling and the smell of pancakes in the air. It just hits different especially in Autumn. But this time … was different. 

Anna and I have this big 2 story house with a nice and pretty good sized backyard, the house is 3 bedroom and 3 bath. Which I know is a lot for just being a couple living there without having any kids, even though I bet that will come on down the road. 

As I head over to the shed in the backyard to get a rake to sweep up the leaves on the ground I hear a weird scratching noise at my fence right next to me. To give perspective on where this was, our house is adjacent to a park on the left side of the house facing from the front yard and adjacent to our Neighbor Pat on the right side of the house facing from the front yard.

“Scratch, scratch, scratch.” Three quiet but audible scratches. Thinking this is Pat’s only pet dog Rex just wanting to play, I grab the rake and head towards the backyard walkway to rake up the fallen orange leaves.

“Scratch! Scratch!” There it was again, this time extremely loud and very audible to hear, even from being away from the shed and fence in which the noise is coming from.

“Michael. Can I get your hand on something real quick? All you have to do is walk over to the fence and help me with something.” “Sure buddy.” I say back to Pat. Thinking that he just needs my help with fixing the fend or something, even if there was anything to fix, or maybe he just wanted to have a conversation like he usually does to get my attention by asking for help.

I get to the fence and I say, “Pat I am here. Tell me what you need my help with.” 

*No answer* and than.

“Scratch…scratch. Again with that damn scratching. This time now in long intervals, about 4 seconds each. I get fed up with this annoyance where I pop my head over the fence to see what the hell or who the hell is making that noise.

But there is no one there. Pat must have been playing a trick on me and ran off or something. I swear I had heard it just seconds ago and he called my name across the yard to ask for some help. “Whatever.” I mutter out loud in annoyance and head back inside the house. 

Heading to the bathroom to do a quick leak. I get interrupted by the ring of the house phone. Yes we still use a house phone even though it’s the 21st century. “I can hold it.” I tell myself as I head over to the phone.

“Ring ring ring ring.” A deafening noise that caused my eardrums to break. I pick up the phone. “Hello.” I say into the other side. “Who is this? What do you want?” *Silence*

But then that familiar noise. 

“Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.” The same scratching, this time on the phone and I can feel my ears tickle from the noise. “Pat is this you?” I say back with a stern voice. “Hahahahaha.” A deep voice sounds on the other end. It sounded like Pat so I knew the only person it could be was him, but something was just off about it, this isn’t how he acts ever. Usually he invited me and Anna over all the time for dinner. Keep in my mind he lives alone and has never had a wife nor even a girlfriend in his 30 plus years he’s been alive.

The phone hangs up after this weird demonic maniacal laughter. “This is getting fucking annoying! I can’t stand this shit anymore!” I say out loud. “I’m gonna head over there now and see what the hell he thinks is so funny.

I put my shoes on and close the front door. Heading over on the sidewall to Patrick’s house. A nice house. A house that looks like a little cottage in the middle of the woods. But I notice something strange as I walk up to his front door.

A lamp is on in his living room and I can make out the silhouette of a person, it’s Pat. “What the fuck is he doing standing there with the curtains shut? The hell is he staring at.”

Just standing there, no movement or anything, nothing. Just completely still, like the shadow of a mannequin. I go up to the door and knock and say, “Hey Pat it’s Michael, just wanted to go and check up on you to see if everything is alright buddy.” 

Suddenly after I say this, I hear commotion from Pat as he starts to walk very fast around the house. But nowhere near the door to answer it. “Come on man, stop playing this prank on me if it is. It was funny before, but now it’s getting old.” I mumble into the doorframe. After I say this a light shuffle across the carpet to the door, then it stops. 

“Pat I know that you are behind there, please open this door and we can talk this out whatever is going on. Ok buddy. If you need some help, I can help you.” I say.

“Scratch, scratch, scratch.” The same old scratching now increasing in its speed like a cat on furniture. “The fuck you doing dude.” I yell out in annoyance. “I am sick of this bullshit! Open the door and let’s talk this weird shit out bro!” 

“i wouldn’t be hear if i were u.” A faint whisper behind the door. “Pat what are you talking about buddy.” I say. *No response.* “Ok, man, fine. I’ll leave.” 

Leaving the doorway, the same silhouette of Pat is by the same lamp in the living room, but this time the silhouette is bigger, like Pat is leaned up against the curtain. But the silhouette not curtain even moved, it was all just completely still like before. Hell, I couldn’t even tell the difference of a statue and Pat with how still he was.

“Alrighty then, bro is acting fucking creepy and I am just gonna go home and mind my own business.” I mutter to myself, a little fearful shaky tone in my voice as I spoke that sentence.

I enter my house and finally go to the bathroom, now remembering that I had been holding it the whole time. I just got so off track with Pats weird behaviour, to the point where I forgot how to pee.

“Ahhh.” I sigh in satisfaction as I urinate. The toilet flushes and I wash my hands and the running water gets interrupted by a noise. 

“Scratch, scratch.” Now the scratching sounds like outside of my bathroom door. Creeping closer to open it and punch Pat, another noise is let out that shook me to my core. A groan, a very deep and death defining groan. “This is enough Pat.” I yell out. “Tell me what you are doing or I will call the police and tackle you to the ground.” Suddenly I hear a loud flopping noise outside of my door like something had just falling into the ground. Checking under the crack of the door, I see Pat’s fingers reaching from through the crack. Than one of Pat’s eyes come to my site, I would say his right, and I see blood everywhere.

He had just gouged out his own eye. What the fuck is going on? 

I yanked open the door and what I see is Patrick on all fours, right eye gouged out and bloody, left eye bloodshot red. “What the fuck Pat.” 

He starts to bark and growl like a dog which shocked me. “This joke is enough, I get Halloween is coming up. But you took this way too far.” 

All of a sudden Pat jumps up onto his feet and pulls out a knife from his front left pocket. I reacted fast enough to this moment and grabbed his arm so he wouldn’t stab me. Pat then starts biting my neck and I yell out in pain. 

Gripping his arm tight, I manage to get the knife out of his arm and stab him in the chest. I will never forget that moment. Blood dripping down his neck as he coughs it all up from his mouth. He whines like a dog that has been bitten and says one last thing before passing out from blood loss.

“I ate Rex.” He says.

I call the cops and they get an ambulance to take Pat to the ER and fortunately he survived the stabbing. I didn’t get arrested or anything because of self defense. Raiding the house the cops found three disturbing things left out in the living room. Rex’s decapitated head being eaten away at by maggots, a butcher knife, and a letter from a cult.

Apparently Pat had been in a cult for a while now and would preform rituals at the park next door to my house. Pat was told to eat a human to sacrifice but he couldn’t do it so they told him to eat any of his own pets. Rex was his only pet so he ate him. Cutting his head off, leaving it on the ground, and eating the rest of the body. 

The worst part about it to me, is how he acted like he was a dog. Like he was Rex, the dog that would always scratch at the fence by the shed. The dog that would always make that familiar noise. 

*scratch scratch scratch*
