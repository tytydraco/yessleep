I know, I know. By the title, you’ve probably assumed this is some meta bullshit story, only concerned with the popular memes surrounding the show, and poking fun at the hosts. This is not that. To the weak of heart and shaky of spirit; turn back. This story isnt worth it. Please, please dont subject yourself to this. 



If you’re still here, dont say I never warned you.



I was an intern at CreepCast Studios. They dont tell you this, but the set is actually all one big sound stage. They still can’t see each other, but things like Kayla walking in are all scripted. Sorry for killing the magic, I guess. Wendigoon and MeatCanyon are actually pretty nice guys, which isnt really a surprise. You might think this is irrelevant information, but it really makes what’s about to happen even more soul-crushing.



When I walked in that morning, everything was as it seemed. Doug Wellers, the receptionist, was telling anybody who would listen that there was another blood drive, and he needed universal donors. The mediocre coffee was almost gone, so I snagged a cup and put on a fresh pot. The writers room was having a loud argument over how many references were too many for the upcoming episode. Life was pretty good. Walking into the stage, cameras were getting set up, and the two stars were exchanging some banter while getting their hair and makeup done. I took a brown paper bag, and put it on Wendigoon’s desk in front of him. He looked up at me and smiled, picking it up and putting it in one of the drawers before turning to address me.



“Hey, thank you for picking up my lunch man. It’s the last of the leftovers from last night, and Kayla’s a great cook.”



“Of course sir.”, I said to him, as I turned to walk away. I had a lot of errands to run, but I liked doing personal favors for the guys. What can I say, It made me feel like a valuable piece in the show. As I rounded the corner, I got a bit of an uncanny feeling. Usually, Wendigoon’s much more chatty than that, especially so early in the day. And his smile…it had seemed just a little forced. I chalked it up to him not getting his daily coffee, and continued on my day. Morning quickly morphed into late afternoon, and I got stuck with the job of cleaning. 



As I was mopping the floor of MeatCanyon’s set, I heard a loud bang. At first I assumed I had knocked one of the dude’s many large props over, and frantically checked for damage. But, nothing had fallen. I heard the bang again, and realized with horror it was coming from Wendigoon’s set. I assumed it was an intruder, or a stalker so I searched my pockets for the phone to call the police. I went to dial, but I realized there was no reception on the set. I had to get out to the lobby. After steeling my nerves, I ran out. Panting, I heard the exploding roar of a door being kicked open, and heavy footsteps pursuing me. I felt a massive weight tackle into me, knocking me down to the ground. The cold hard steel of a knife being stabbed into my ribs. Red-hot agony flooding into my torso caused me to scream loudly, and I managed to kick and thrash my way to freedom. 



It was then I saw the creature. It looked like Wendigoon, but his limbs were elongated to at least three times their original length, and he was on all fours. His bottom jaw was missing, and massive fangs jutted out of his mouth. I realized that is what had pierced my chest. Surprisingly, his face was still quite human, and he had an expression of pain and great fear. I got the sense he was not in control of his own body. The creature tackled me again, biting and snarling trying to rip my throat out. Struggling to fight back, I grabbed my phone, smacking the creature’s eye with its hard metal corner. It wailed and staggered back, giving me the chance to run to the security desk. I was going to try and grab the gun there, but I could sense the creature right behind me. At the last second I kicked the door open, and fumbled to grab the gun. As I did, i saw Mr. Weller lying cold and dead on the floor, completely eviscerated. Choking back my vomit, I pulled his handgun out of his waistband, just as I felt the creature grab me. As it turned me around, ready to bite my head off, I pulled out the gun, pressing the barrel against the top of its mouth.



“Get fucked, you bitch.” I pulled the trigger three times, and the creature’s head exploded. It staggered back, before lying on the ground dead. As it collapsed, it was wreathed in grey smoke, and when it cleared, the body was gone. 



“You’re tougher than I expected.” As I heard this I spun to see a hooded figure, surrounded by mystic symbols and radiating heat. I realize that I'm looking at MeatCanyon. He threw back to the hood to reveal he was totally bald, tattooed in occult symbols. “You see, I was tired of Wendigoon being the face of the podcast. After all, I deserved half of the clout and fame. So, I turned to the dark arts, slowly corrupting his mind and body, until I was ready to seize control of him.”



He kept rambling about some bullshit, but i didnt give a fuck. I pulled out the handgun, shooting him in the stomach. He let out a loud grunt, falling on his back. “NO, NOOOOOO!” he cried out, before i finished him off with a shot to the face. 



“Pretty good shooting kid.” I turned around with shock, realizing that Marcus was standing behind me, holding up a business card
