The room grew cold, suffocating. My breath came out in sharp, visible gasps. The chill wasn’t from the air, but something darker, crawling up my spine. He stood, blending into the shadows, watching me. His eyes—dark, calm—never left mine.

“I know you want to refuse my gift,” he said, voice smooth, like honey. His words didn’t just enter my mind; they settled, as if they belonged.

I stiffened. How did he know? I hadn’t spoken. His eyes locked onto mine. My pulse quickened, as if he could see through me.

“Because you don’t think you deserve it.”

I froze. It was true. I hadn’t earned anything. My life, a series of failures. A mess of bad decisions. I opened my mouth to protest, but the words died.

He was right.

His gaze, sharp, predatory, yet calm, never wavered. “Let me assure you,” he said, stepping closer. His voice curled into my mind, tightening around me. “You don’t deserve it. You haven’t earned this blessing.”

The words stung, pressed down on me. All my mistakes, broken promises, swirled in my stomach. I felt small, insignificant.

I swallowed, trying to push the fear down, but it clawed back, making my hands tremble.

“But this isn’t about what you deserve,” he said, voice softer now, almost sympathetic. “I want you to have it. That’s why I’m giving it to you. Nothing more.”

His smile, thin, unfeeling, like a blade. He knew the weight of his words. The room grew colder with each second, the gift between us pressing against my chest, real, almost mine.

There had to be a catch. There always was.

“Why me?” I whispered, trembling with fear, maybe hope. Maybe desperation.

His eyes flickered, lips unmoving. “Because I see you,” he said. The words cut deeper than the chill. “I see the truth beneath your mask. You think you’re unworthy, broken. But you’re wrong. You deserve it.”

I shook my head. His words slipped under my skin, making me crawl. “I don’t deserve your pity,” I forced out.

He chuckled—low, cold, empty. “This isn’t pity. It’s a gift. A choice.”

His presence suffocating. The air hummed with an unnatural energy. Slowly, he raised his hand. A strange warmth pulsed between us, like magnets pulling, wrapping around my chest. Power. Possibility. A dangerous promise.

“I’m giving you the chance to change,” he said, voice soft but heavy. “To become something more.”

I wanted to step back, refuse, scream. But the words caught in my throat. What was he offering? What would I become? Could I trust him? Could I trust myself?

“Take it,” he urged, his voice sharp now, cutting through my fear. “Or walk away. But know this—you’ll never have this chance again.”

The room closed in, suffocating, a blade hanging over my head. My heart hammered. I wanted to walk away. I wanted to refuse. My legs shook, the metallic taste of fear in my mouth.

But deep down, I knew. I wanted it.

I reached out, fingers trembling as I closed the distance.

His fingers brushed mine—cold, electric, like fire and ice. A pulse shot through me, strange, unnatural, igniting something inside. He placed the gift in my palm—small, weightless, yet it burned.

“Good,” he whispered. “Now, let’s see who you truly are.”

Then, the room twisted.

The air thickened. The walls bent, closing in, warping, like reality itself splintering at the edges.

I felt it. The gift wasn’t a blessing. It was a key. A key to something else. A choice, a path, a decision that would change everything. It wasn’t the gift that would change me. It was what I would become with it.

The room wasn’t cold anymore. It was alive—breathing. Watching.
