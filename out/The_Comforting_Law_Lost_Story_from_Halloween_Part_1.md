 

I just found this a little while ago. It was something I started to write around Halloween, intending to share here. The thing is, I remember starting this story, but I don't remember ending it. Trying to remember everything is really difficult. I keep feeling like there's something more that I'm forgetting... Maybe you guys can help me? Has anyone had this happen to them before?

Let me share with you and try to explain. So here's the first bit that I remember writing:

>I have always loved the Halloween season. I love to look for new books that give me a chill. I’m always searching for any promising titles, ones that sound interesting. I’m a bit ashamed to admit, I do often judge a book by its cover.  
>  
>I found one a few weeks ago that looked really promising. It was a plain black cover, looked like maybe some sort of textured leather? The title was in a silvery ink, slightly embossed. There was this simple nature to it that really got my attention. I almost felt like I was seeing something more than I was actually seeing.

>… Sorry about that… If you can’t tell yet, I’m not quite alright. That’s why I want to tell this story, I um. I will try to keep myself together for this, but my head is still messed up a bit from everything.  
>  
>Anyway, I looked at the book, and there was no synopsis or little blurb on the back. It didn’t look that old, it even had that really nice new blood book smell. The thing was, there was something about the book… I began flipping through the first couple of pages, and… I know it sounds crazy, but it was like reading thousands of stories all at once. As though somehow I had hundreds of books in front of me, and I was reading them all at the same time. But there wasn’t any cacophony of noise, no overwhelming assault on my mind. I don’t know if I can explain it any better… Even though I felt like I could read it just fine, thinking about it or trying to explain it makes my head hurt…  
>  
>Of course, it wasn’t like that when I first read the little synopsis on the web page. I mean, it still said the same stuff, but… I don’t know how or why, but it just made sense to me at the time. But I wasn’t looking at it on a website, why was there a web page… I was holding the book in my hands, but it was on the screen too? I think something was messing with my head already, as soon as I started looking at that damn book.g̶̢̢̼͍͉͈̯̭͈̪̺̦̭̓̔͒ͅè̸̘͓͚͇́͒̑̆̃̈̔̓͂̕̚t̸̨̼̙͇̲̦̿̆͋̇͌̂̕͜ö̶͈̪͖͈̣͖̻̝̞̥̰̘̲́͌́̆̾̾ͅͅu̷͈̹͕̝̿̊͗t̴̹̍̈́̈́͝ö̷͈̻̼̪́̒̓̄̒͒̽͘͜ͅf̷̺̱̞̬̟̖̭͍̞̗̓̇̌́̑̿͊̌͘̕̚͜m̵̗̣̝̽̽̃́͑͋̐̀̓̓̄̃͆̌̐͜ȳ̵͎̜̰̥̮̠̻̤͔̖̤̈́̀̈́͊͋̿̀̓̚̕̚h̵͉͉̠̳̞͍̿̉̈̉̐̇̓ẽ̷̠͉̱̰̺̺̖͕̪̟̘͈͂̈́̓͝a̸̧̱̘͕̗͉̣͑̃̒̃͛̊̀͛͗̚͠͝d̸̲̠̦̣̲̝̦͕͓̭̠͚̃͋g̶̮̯̈́̎̄̂̋̆͝e̶̡̨̱͕͕̫͈̹̥̘̺̺͌̔̍̌̓̌̏̎́̐͊̔̀ţ̶̨̻̺̻̜̦͇̤̫̣͓̀́͋ơ̶̱͎͎̱̖̥̟̤̪̼̦͇͙̠̌͊͒̔͐́̌̈́̍͊̍̅ủ̴̺̰̝͔̲̰͔̻̝͔̽͗̀̒̀̄̕t̶̡̨̗͍̥̗̪͇̪̻̬̉ơ̷̡̜̭͍͎̼͉͔̰͕͎̼͛̆̽́̓́͛̉̊͌͋͑͜f̵̜̳̯͉͕͙̰͖͖̠̉̒͋̽̂̓͘̕͝͝ͅm̵̤̹̳̀̌̋̓̈̈́͝y̴̡̨̢̛̼̤̙̣̞͉̗̫͉̠̗̆͂̈h̵̡̨̥͎͔̫̜͕̊̍̽̉ë̷̖̼̗̠̻͇͋̚ă̷̧̘̩͉͈̻͍̾͑͂́̃̈̋̃̄̓̽͋͠ḑ̷̧̭͔̲̝̄̋̃̓̈͊̒̀̎̑̃͠͠͝g̵̰̳̳͙̜͇̅̔̋̿̌̊̑̽̎̌̆̕̕ȩ̸̡͈̯͕̳̮͓͉͈͎̓̓͛͗̀ͅt̸̝͐͊̐͐̀̀͂̌͌̚͝͠o̸̡̨̢̹̦͚͍͓̖̗̹͓̔ư̶̰̘̄̌͑́̑̋̿̇̈́̃t̷̰̻͕̰̣̜̗̝͒̒̽̈̐͗͂͒́̂͛̆͘͜͝͝ó̵̡̨̧̯̱̮͓̜̽̈́́̓́̚͘͝͝f̸̛̗̰̭͊͆̆̿̎͐̾̿̿̒̽͌̚m̵̺̱̰̯͂͗̀̌̂̂͂̒̔̓̃̚ͅỳ̴̡̖̦̱̼̀̆͊͐͗̀̑̓̚ḫ̵̡̧͉͚̪̦̯̥̔̂̅̚͠͠e̴̡̘͕͎͕̪̼̳̼̠̍̾̍̅͑a̴̛͙̰̠̤͗͐́́͆̓ͅd̷͇̩̥̩͇̞͙̠͐̔͑̑̉̾̎̀̄͘̕g̶̡̫̤̬͖͍̣̗̍̇̿̓͂̃̎̌͌̄̈́̋͘̚ͅę̶̡̡̟̤̘̖͔̺͔̓ṫ̵̼̥̪̱͉̅̄o̴̢̜̝͙̙̾̉̐̑̂̅͋̿͆͊͒̀͝u̸̧̞̻̤͎͉̓̌̓́͛̈́̊͌̆̂̀͜͝t̸̨̢̢̞̩͚̲̥̰̗̝̾̽̋̄̈́͜ͅo̴̙̘͍̦̟͔̗̟̤̯͑̔̈́͗͆͝͝͝f̴͔̦̙̥̯͈͓̬̜̠͇̂m̴̧̛͓̙͔̞͖̜̠̙̩̏̀̈͋̃̒͆͆ẏ̷̨̹͉̫̪͚̥̲̹̼̼̦̲̲̞̉̆͋̀̐̈́̌͘h̷̰̉̈̏̓͑͑̐̚e̶͉̬̙̭̒͠a̷̡̧̦̣̖͉̞͉̤̹̝̬̓͑̎͋̈́̔̿͗͂̓̃̋͘͜͠d̷̡͕͙͎͎̥͚͕̼̮̯̫̟̄̎͜͜ģ̶̘̲͓̖̙̖̰͎̩̗̪̽̑̽̏̽̍̾̑é̶͖̜̟̣͖͖̗̥̗̞͆̂̃̈́̏̉͌̓̏͆̌͘͘t̸̡͙͇̲͚͙̻̤̮͕̃̒͆̅̉̌̇̽̀̈́̃̕̕͝ȯ̸̢͙͓͖̤͕̬̘͖̘̯̰̲̩͋̆͒̀̃͑͐ͅu̸̧̢̡͖̱̩̻͙̘̰͕̼̠̪̍̿̎t̷̠̟͍͘õ̵̎͛̋̀͐͋͐͑̓̀̑͜͝͝f̴̢̛̝́̑ͅm̷̜̼̠͚͈̝͉̓̍̈͋͂̚y̶̖̲̝̰̼͕͙͈̝͇͉͊h̴̥̗̰͉̼̜̓̐̍̓̏̊́̓͗̌̓͆̕͜e̴̡̳͍͗̉̈́̃̋̂̀̇͊̆̓͠a̶̩͓̹̐́̀̊͆d̶͖̮̗̹́͌̊̐̌̓̇͐͛̀̿͘̕g̷͉̤͎͖̋͌̚ḝ̷̨̭̘̲̹͎͇͈̳͛̑̔̌͋̈́̋̕͜t̷̼̜͈̹͓͕̦͙̼̓̋̂͆͒̌̄̂̔͐͝ͅo̷̜͉̻͎̜̤͔̟̠̗̗͚̟͚̦̎̆͊ư̶̧̰̥͍̪͚̼̒̃̆̋͂̿͘̚͝t̷̪͈͚̩̞̩̪͋̈͂̔̓ͅo̸̢̪͚̬͎̐͝f̷̨̠͉͚͉̩̥̰̉͂̒̈́̏͂͗̂̆̇̋̓͘m̷̡̲͔̬̠̤̣̝̊̾̓̎̀̔͑ͅy̸̡̤̯̻͙̳̺̖͋̚ͅẖ̶̯̎̂̒̽͆̈͗̓͐͊͝ę̴̻͚͉̪̫̘͍̱̻̬̭̥̣̻̈́̎̅̍̏̈͊͊͐̀̽̏̀́̕a̶͍̫̞͇͉̤̞̍̽̆̋̓̈̃͝ď̵̢̡̡̤̘͙̥̣̘͚͍͎͓̬̪̇͆̀͂͂̕̚͠ǵ̵̙̾͌́̂̈́͝e̸̡͈̜̠̲͆̉̑̒ṭ̴̨̨̰̼͈̗͕͉͖͍̱̹͙͒̆ǒ̴̩̳̱̭͈͓̦͂̇̉͂͆̈́͌͛̕͘u̴͉̟͕̜͚̻͒̏̽̓͜ͅͅt̴̡͖̩͈͚͉̺̝͚̬̺̣͈̹̊̊̃͑̆͠ͅờ̵̡͍͔̱͖͉͇͇̤̼̦̳̜̊͐͆̎̐͜͠f̷̨̢̢̨̪͇͚̗̫͙̹͌m̷͎̪̤̞͇̱̺̖͗̈́͌͋͜͝y̴̛͇̌̐͗͒̈́͆̂͐̚͝h̵́̓̏̅́̅̃ͅẹ̴̢̟͆̀̌͑̂̈̋̾̐́a̵̧̗̟̭͕̤̼̯̭͉̙̯̰̮͊ͅd̶͕̽̔̾̈́̾̅͂̒g̶̛͙͛͐͂̔̽̔̀̑̔̊͂̉͐͝ẽ̸͎̭̳̹̦̖̮̮́͗t̵̬̠͎͎̟͔̮̰͓͕̗̦̳̊̍͑̃̎̈̿͘͘͜͝ͅö̸̗̬̠͛̒̓̔̈́̋̿͋͆̀̄͐͠͠u̶̧̢̧͙̖̫͈̼̘̗̲̹̝̇̓̔̋͊̒͒̑̿̚̕͠͠t̴̥̰̭͈̠̝̬͍̬̺͗̊̂͊̅͋̈́̿͘̚͘͜ỏ̴͚̪̟̣̭̙͋̂̚f̴̢̤͈̮̣͔̬̖̪͓̯̪͚̃̈̇̅̄͋͆͌̂͒͋̋̂̉͑͜͜m̸͔̩̝̝̲̼̖͓̓̽͆̊̄͊y̴̧̢̧̳̘̝̫͉͇̤̝͌̈́̈́̌̈́͑̐̓͋̔̓̾̀͝h̷͍͔͙̫̤̦̹̯̲̤̄̈́̾͌̀̏͛͊͂́͆̚͘ͅė̵̹̺͎̝̦̪͚̤͖͈̙̯̠̱ȁ̶̡̨̛̫̼̖̬̙͇͚̺͚̑̄̏͋̎̽̚ͅͅd̴̡̪͍̲̖̲͈͍̻̰͗̈́̎̇̐͗̄͑͘g̶̢̩̥̘͓̲̤͇̳̻̼͚͍̥͇͑̊̐̇͂̄ė̷̡̺̣̩̳̗̼̳͉̀̾́̏̍͂͠t̶̡̥͓̦͕͚̞̗̆̃͐͐̋̒͂̇̎͗o̷̪̮̺̲̬̟̳͐̑̃̽́͊̿͋͛͒͝͠ͅų̶̨̩̠̱̮̥̜̏̍́̋̐́̋̎̓̉͗͑̚͘͠t̸̡̛̛͎̞̤̙̻̩̘̤̫̓́̈́̋̊̒͑̊̚̕o̷̡̱̟̪̱̰̪͗̊̃̑̀̊f̵̠͓͇͕͙̮̘̯̫̤͙͈̾̋͜m̵̝̭͖͎͈̺̗̲̲͂̈͆̚͝y̴̛̌͌͋͛̈́͂̄̈́̕͝ͅh̸͚̞̻̖̮̫̏͗e̴̡̡̼͈͕̬̬̜͍̫̗̎̏̔̔́̾̇́̍̎̈͐́̈́̕á̵͓̙͚̙͙̝̣͕̺̘͊̿̋̀̈́̕̚d̴̢̙̝̲̹̱̤̟̰̺͕̍̅̄͜ͅ

My phone had a book light app, and I used that to begin reading. I had to read.

>I don’t know why I felt so desperately this need. I was sweating horribly, my hair was soaked and it seemed to be running into my eyes. I’ve never tried drugs before, but I imagine this was what it was like to experience withdrawals?

Now as I said, this is as far as I remember writing. I was super hyped and feeling inspired, I did actually get this black book that prompted me, but it's just a journal. Blank pages, nothing on them.

The thing is, there's this whole new text in my document that I don't remember writing at all. It is a complete break from the story I was building up to, and was written in a completely different, pseudo-biblical style?

>And I looked, and beheld the giant ████. And I did watch as ████ prepared to go unto battle with the Beast of the Seas. Now behold, I was astonished, for I did see ████ remove his ████, and he did drop his sword and shield. Behold, I watched, as he did strip himself until he was naked, and in his nakedness did he face the Great Beast.  
>  
>And I looked and beheld the Beast was like unto a great serpent, and its head was flat like unto a dish. And I beheld that it had no eyes, but upon the bottom of its head were many mouths, and from these mouths issued forth great waters that the beast did use to drown its foes.  
>  
>Now behold I did see the beast rise up, and it did release a great storm from its many mouths to smite ████. And I beheld the beast’s skin, that it was as strong as iron. And behold, upon its skin was all the world, and I did see many great and terrible things upon the skin of the beast.  
>  
>And I beheld that ████ did resist the great storm that the Beast smote him with, and I beheld that he did ████ with the Beast. And I beheld that ████ did take the Beast by the neck, and I beheld that he struggled mightily with the Beast.  
>  
>And I looked, and beheld as ████ did drive back the beast, insomuch that the Beast did ████ to its cave. Now behold, ████ did follow after the beast, and I beheld that ████ did espy that beast did have eggs. And behold, there were three eggs, whose ████ were like unto the beast's skin, and there were many great and terrible things that I did see in the ████ of the eggs.  
>  
>And I looked and did witness as ████ the giant did reach forth his great hand, and did smite the eggs. Now behold the beast became still after this, and did seem to die.  
>  
>And I looked and beheld that ████ did depart out of the den of the beast. And behold I was left alone with the great body of the Beast of the Seas. And as I stood watching, behold! I did feel the woe of the world upon me! For behold, though the beast lay still it was made known unto me that it did still live! Woe, and it did perceive me as I looked upon it!  
>  
>Now behold, to be observed of the beast was surely hell. For though it lay still, it knew of me, and though it lay dead, it was alive and it did comprehend me and consider me in all its ████.  
>  
>And I looked and behold, the beast did ████ my own image in its skin, and a terrible agony did come upon me. And I felt the torment of hell inside me, the ████ fire of the wicked did fill my throat and ████. And the beast did cause me to shake in its presence, and behold, it did consider me without ████ or mercy. And it came to pass that I did perceive that the Beast did delight in my suffering.  
>  
>And behold, the Beast did finally stir, and it opened its many mouths, and spake unto me, saying “I Am The One That Always ████. I Am The Lover and She Who ████. Thou wilt return to thy home, and write the things thou hast seen. For in the course of time shall He Who ████ read thy words, and the ████ of the flesh shall begin.”  
>  
>And I did look, and upon the skin of the Beast I beheld an image of a creature that surely was great and terrible, an Abomination upon the land and the minds of men. And the Beast did tell me the name of the Abomination, and behold, to hear its name did cause my ears to ████ and the agony of death did come upon me.  
>  
>And behold, the Beast did instruct me that I should instead call it Mbrachorrs, which in the tongue of the Beast meant “The ████ Embrace”. Now behold, I did see great lights along the head of the Abomination. And the lights ████ like the stars of the deep. And I beheld that its mouth was ████, and it did seem to me that the great jaws of the Abomination could consume the earth.  
>  
>And I beheld that the arms of the Abomination were as the bodies of many serpents, and they did ████ and ████ at me. And upon the end of each serpent there were many hands, and the hands did reach out to ████ at me.  
>  
>And I did look upon the face of the Abomination, and behold it had two great eyes. And in its two great eyes there were thousands more eyes. And the eyes inside the eyes to wax and ████, and did stare at me in lust and desire. And I perceived a great longing from the Abomination, for it did desire me, to consume me. And this desire to cause my frame to shake and tremble mightily.

And it just abruptly cuts off right there. Nothing more, no resolution or anything. I have no idea who wrote this, It for sure wasn't me. I don't have the file shared anywhere, so I don't know how this happened.

I'm not sure what's with the black spaces, or what is even going on with this... blurb... at all. The strangest thing though, I keep getting a feeling that the name of the Giant is Saashani? Like, I don't know why I feel that way, but just... that name is what comes to my head.

Just out of curiosity, I checked that journal again, but I didn't see anything special or odd. I figured it was better to play it safe, even if it did seem a little crazy and foolish. I don't know, I think the situation has gotten a little to my head. I am starting to feel a little feverish all of a sudden.

I'll probably rest a bit, and then try to dig in to this a little more. Anyway, I better go now, I'm getting a nosebleed and I don't want that to drip onto the keyboard.
