I don’t remember what I ate, or how we got there—but I remember what it felt like when the walls started moving.

A table cluttered with reheated carbs and wet meat laid in front of me. The oak-boarded walls framed my parents as they shoveled their gullets full of the nutrient-lacking buffet. The ambience of Cracker Barrel has always unsettled me. The feigned laughter among a table full of reunited coworkers rings in my head while restless cars in the parking lot endlessly blind the patrons within. The gift shop blares corporate country music to soothe the part of the customer that wants to flee. Indulgence at every corner.

Through the slats in the blinds, our car sat in the heat like a sun-bleached insect. The windshield pulsed faintly in the light, but nothing inside stirred. I looked back into the room. Crossed canoe oars—too clean to be real—hung beneath a framed salmon print on office paper, yellowed slightly like everything else.

For a moment I believed I saw a plant sitting on a shelf, but a squint of my eyes revealed it to be a photograph of a plant on a shelf. I redirected my confusion to the complimentary peg game provided for all guests. My prize for winning was an unenthusiastic refill for my water. Looking back toward the shelf, I felt that aside from the misleading and corporate subject matter, this photograph felt wrong. It felt like the longer I gazed upon it, the larger it became. It was getting larger. No, it was closing in on me. The whole wall with it.

All of the walls were inching in on themselves. The foot gap between the back of my family’s chairs and the wall was now a contact point moving toward the table. Looking around, I noticed that the herds hadn’t even noticed their space was being cramped. The employees were watching the clock, eyes glazed over, waiting for their shift to end. The servers began squeezing between tables to refill empty glasses, their smiles never dropping.

Panicked, I stood up. My head hit a sloppily assembled deer antler chandelier. I didn’t have to look up very far to see that the ceiling dropped significantly faster than the walls had closed in. If I didn’t leave I would suffocate.

There was no clear route to the main entrance. Hunched backs were now wrestling with one another for space. Compressed waitresses walked on tables to navigate from the slaughterhouse to the tables. Confused wet hands grabbed at anything with glaze.

I crawled up onto my table with only enough room to crouch, my parents looking at me with irresponsible eyes. Beginning the cramped shuffle off of my table to the next, I notice that the shoulder to shoulder crowd is unable to keep up with the replenishing feast in front of them. An elderly man’s solution was to remove his dentures to make more room for his commercial hash browns. As if following the teachings a prophet, the mass of gluttonous maws lodged silverware between gum and tooth, prying them loose.. The insatiable static consumed minutely faster, unimpeded by the hindrances they’d been born with.

In the time I observed this orthodontic suicide, the ceiling pushed me down to my knees. The walls closed in until the tables were packed so tightly, no light could pass through underneath. I crawled as quickly as I could, using the eating heads as a grip to pull myself away from the strong hooves pulling me back.

The gift shop was all that stood between myself and the exit, but the passageway to it was shrinking rapidly. The splintered arch, leading to the gift shop, was at most a foot tall. While I had enough room to crawl on the tables, I would have to lay on my stomach and squeeze myself through the passageway. I began by forcing my body into downward dog and slipped my head and arms through the hole. The gift shop greeted my upper half with an artificial spruce scent. Using what limited movement I could manage, I forced my shoulders and rib cage through to the jolly menagerie of knickknacks.

The gate constricted even more, clutching my waist. Adrenaline and fear consumed me as the nagging chewing and swallowing behind me turned to low moans. I pulled myself against the splintered frame, my skin giving before the sharp wood did. A happy collection of price points welcomed my full form on the other end. A corporate pop song is playing softly as compression causes the products on display to crash onto lower shelves. Among these products is a carved black bear with the eyes of the employer. It’s imperfect eyes jealous of my mobility.

Behind me, I heard my parents’ voices among the visceral shrieks signaling crushed spines or out-of-reach food. The cries flooded through the shattered front window, chasing my intended escape.

Blinded by urgency, I rushed through the gift shop.. The licensed childhood heroes pasted on the overpriced shirts appeared to be weeping. The cashier just finished clipping her nails and was on her third quality check, ensuring they looked perfect. That same plant photograph seen in the dining area also for sale, but its price wasn’t written in numbers. The squeals now intensified and were harmonizing with the guttural bubbling of forced wet air.

Upon exiting, I collapsed onto the compressed soil where the foundation of the building used to be. Adrenaline made me both unable to stand and incapable of resting. I crawled until my palms felt asphalt nearly 25 feet away. I rolled over and scanned the restaurant I was in moments prior and the establishment was now the size of the car my family drove here in.

As the building continued to compress, the sounds of impossibly loud contortions and collisions filled the air. The screams were quickly replaced by the sounds of dozens of tables dryly imploding to fill the space of a single chair. The smaller the building got, the louder the sounds became. I got to my feet and stammered to the car, too preoccupied to realize the keys were left inside the restaurant.

It wasn’t until the spectacle shrunk down to the size of a pack of gum that the noise went completely mute. It was as if every last particle of human and furnishings in there found equilibrium. 

Despite the lull in the air, the wet crushing and consumption continued in my head. The visions overwhelmed my mind, constrained by my capacity to process them, as if my very psyche was an echo of the morbid devastation that took place moments before

When it was all over, I clearly heard birds chirping ignorantly. It was a strangely beautiful day.



Fifteen years have passed since then. I now stand here at the site in which it all took place, seeing no evidence of the restaurant’s existence. Dust covered cars litter the overgrown parking lot for an establishment that is no longer here. I don’t know why I came back. Maybe some part of me believes that if I returned, I would find a reason that any of this happened in the first place. Instead I am filled with an indescribable indifference. A hollow restlessness that clouds my ability to ground myself in reality.

My family’s car is still here. Inside I see my DSi–my parents never let me play it when we went out to eat. In the center console, there’s a large and medium sized cup. My dad must have been driving because the large cup is in the front cup holder. Even from the outside, I swear I can still smell the black ice air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror.

Removing my hand from the window, I hold no memory of the day that left the interior of the car looking like this, but I can remember every detail of what happened within those shrinking walls. Nobody could have known what would take place in there, but why am I the only one who made it out to the other side? Why do I suddenly remember everybody watching me?

Despite the compounding unanswerable questions, I find comfort in knowing that a part of my life has been sealed away in that car, untouched, preserved in innocence.
