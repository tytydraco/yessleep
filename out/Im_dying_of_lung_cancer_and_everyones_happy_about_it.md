That’s what really frightens me—not the diagnosis, but the people on this godforsaken island.

I’m going to die here, and they’re actively *rejoicing*.

I’ve lost my sanity, as if it weren’t already enough to be dying—glacially and agonisingly, for that matter. I’m reaching out to Reddit because I think my relatives, friends, and neighbours have collectively lost their humanity. Please, for the love of all that is good in this world, say something normal, empathetic, and fucking *SANE*.

I won’t identify myself or my location, for obvious reasons, but know that this isle is little more than a skerry—a pebble in the ocean, bound to the mainland by no more than one daily ferry at three in the afternoon. Horribly, thanks to my decaying body, I lack the physical strength to leave this place; I barely have the strength to leave my house. And nobody here is helping me. They’re just watching me die. Slowly. Day by day. Except they’re not just watching.

They’re the ones who did this to me.

To explain, my mainland friends—from my old job and university—have always called the island folk ‘cultists’, and I’ve long struggled to argue with that claim. After all, I was nearly entirely ostracised by the people of the island, as a whole, for leaving this rock to go and study in the city. That broke the rules. Their savage, unwritten rules. People are born here, and they’re buried here. That’s just the way it goes.

Anyhow, 2 years ago, after I (31m) lost my job in the city, I returned home on a ferry, tail between my legs. The islanders welcomed me back with closed arms. Still, the fact that they let me back at all was somewhat of a blessing. I moved into my brother’s house, and, over time, he—Chris— helped me to make amends with the other villagers for ‘deserting’ them.

After a year or so, things started to seem normal again, but I may not be the best judge. I grew up here, so ‘normal’ to me might not be normal to you. As I lie in my bed, reduced to a shadow, I realised that I’ve always overlooked oddities about this place and its people.

Oddities that I certainly didn’t notice until last Tuesday when I started coughing up blood.

To find yourself kneeling over a toilet bowl—near-*puking* a stream of thick, bloody phlegm—is a horror I struggle to put into words. There had been no symptoms leading up to that. At eight on Tuesday morning, I woke with a sudden gnawing sensation in my body, from head to toes, and a scratch at the top of my esophagus—as if something had dug its nails into my throat from the inside.

By the afternoon, I was struggling from shortness of breath, so I phoned the island clinic and booked an appointment with Dr Arnold. And I do vaguely recall, whilst I locked my brother’s front door, seeing a smudge of mud splattered against the glass pane. It was a neat circle with a splattering of muddy specks in the middle, clustering more densely as they neared the top of the ring—forming a sort of brown gradient.

*A kid probably kicked a ball at the door*, I decided as I scurried to my car.

When I arrived at the clinic on that Tuesday afternoon, a little before dusk, I was greeted by a smiling Dr Arnold. He X-rayed my chest and spotted a white-grey mass, then he gave me the dire news.

“Lung cancer?” I hoarsely repeated, throat stinging from the blood I’d been hacking up. “No… Please… I…”

“Oh, *Joshua*!” the doctor interjected with an eye roll, before saying the most unnerving thing of all. “Relax. We all have a little bit of cancer.”

And I failed to utter anything in response.

Instead, my mind over-extended itself in an effort to process the lunacy of what this fully-certified doctor had just said to me.

*Maybe he means that… our cells are always mutating?* I thought. *No, that wasn’t what he said. He said, ‘we all have a little bit of a cancer.’ A fucking doctor said that.*

I would’ve chalked it up to incompetence. Medical negligence. However, at the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist, I knew it was more than that. And now, a week later, I’m absolutely certain.

It was something in Dr Arnold’s pupils. As I walked out of his office, I noticed a glint in those beady eyes, and his grin was not a kind one. Not in the slightest.

Then again, I didn’t and don’t know Dr Arnold well. He’s only been the doctor on our island for the past 4 years, and I’ve only been here for the past 2. I’ve missed a lot; I was away from the island for most of my twenties.

*Maybe his face doesn’t match his thoughts*, I considered, but I knew full well that there had been intent in those eyes—horrid intent.

Anyway, I drove back to my brother’s house, and I told him the awful news.

Chris is a good man. He’s kind, caring, and sensitive. He cried 7 years ago when I rang to tell him that I’d crashed my motorbike and broken my leg. I just want to point that out before I explain what happened next.

“I have lung cancer,” I croaked.

My brother was washing the plates, but he stopped abruptly—the second I uttered the word ‘cancer’. I expected the floodgates to part, much as they had after my motorcycle accident.

And there *were* tears—just not sad ones.

On that face, he wore a smile like the one I’d just seen on Dr Arnold.

“Are you serious, Josh?” Chris half-whispered, seeming to hold back a giggle.

“Yes…” I answered slowly. “Are you okay? Your face looks…”

“What? How does it look?” he asked, tears trickling from his eyes—*gleeful* eyes. “This is a blessing. I wish *I* had your gift! It’d make life so much easier. Let me show you!”

Chris shot across the room at such speed. The orange glow of dusk, coming through the kitchen window, revealed only a little of his giddy lips, overflowing with froth. This rabid thing, once my brother, seized a clump of my hair, then started to thrust my body forwards like a battering ram.

“Let’s get all of that good stuff out of you, shall we?” he started to roar as we neared the kitchen sink. “It’s a blessing from *Ralckan!*”

I began to cry, “What the fuck are you—”

His fingers cut my protest short when they rammed down my throat, provoking my gag reflex. Then I threw up more red phlegm in a gushing flow that stained the water and soapy plates beneath my face.

With bloodshot eyes and saliva-coated lips, I fearfully pleaded, “Stop…”

“Oh, it’s beautiful,” Chris interrupted, swirling his fingers in the bloody muck I’d just coughed up into the water. “Just like he said it would be.”

I noticed it on his wrist. A wound. A red circle cut into his flesh, filled with a gradient of dots pricked by something sharp.

The symbol from the door.

I screamed with closed lips as my face was dunked into the water, but I involuntarily choked out a few more drops of blood into the red—the polluted water which, horrifyingly, engulfed me. Then Chris dug his fingers more deeply into my hair, hoisted me out of the bloody filth in the sink, and lifted me to eye level with the kitchen window.

“Ralckan…” my brother whispered. “You’re so fortunate.”

Standing in the near-dark of Chris’ back garden, barely revealed by the last dregs of red from a setting sun, was something that broadened my petrified eyes.

A man.

Only, he didn’t look like a man at all. The figure wore a black, hooded trench coat, hiding what one would assume to be a human form, but his face betrayed him. It was covered in tumours the size of fists. Two dark pinpricks—eyes, I think—were sitting in tight crannies, squished uncomfortably between the tumours—those bulbous blobs of green, swollen skin. And his discoloured skin grew darker towards the top of his face.

The symbol represented this man’s deformed face.

Suddenly, my giggling, deranged brother slammed my head against the rounded edge of the kitchen counter, and all fell to black.

When I woke, I found myself on the kitchen floor of a pitch-black house, and Josh was gone. It’s been seven days, and he hasn’t returned.

Every morning, my condition worsens. My body weakens. Even lumbering down to the kitchen for food and water is painful; my skin and my bones seem to be withering.

Before all of this, on that Tuesday evening after Chris attacked me, I rang Lindsay—the island’s ferrywoman.

She picked up. Lindsay *always* picks up. She lives by that old corded phone in her living room. Another thing that she will always do, if one only asks, is take a trip to the mainland—even after the official three o’clock voyage.

Much like Chris, however, she wasn’t herself.

“No, Joshua,” the old lady hissed near-breathlessly from the other end of the landline. “I don’t think *he* would like you to go ashore.”

She hung up, and she hasn’t taken my calls since.

I don’t have the strength to steal a boat. Certainly don’t have the strength to paddle to the mainland. My old friends haven’t been picking up the phone or answering their messages, which is concerning, so now I’m turning to the internet.

What do I do? I’m coughing up my fucking lungs. The island’s gone insane.

I’ve tried to tell myself that the man in the garden is just some poor, unwell person. Unwell like my brother, Lindsay, and Dr Arnold. Unwell like me, perhaps. But there’s more to it than that. Collective hysteria is sweeping across the island—even the fucking *postman* slipped some blank envelopes through my letterbox at the weekend; they each bore that circular symbol, smeared in blood.

I’m haunted by the toothy smile, and waving hand, he offered from the other side of the front door’s frosted pane.

So many questions are whirring through my mind. Do I even have lung cancer? Has somebody done something else to me?

I saw Chris in the garden last night. Looking up at me. I don’t know why he’s left me on my own.

Please, somebody, comment something. Quickly. Now. Right fucking now.
