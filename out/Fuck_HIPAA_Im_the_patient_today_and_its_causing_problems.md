On July 29, 2003, the Grays Harbor County Sheriff’s Department responded to a domestic dispute near Elma, Washington. 



The caller claimed that her 11-year-old niece had assaulted her teenage daughter, badly breaking her hand in the process, before running away. 



Responding officers confirmed that the alleged victim’s hand was badly broken before initiating a search for the juvenile suspect. 



They found her several hours later in a river on the property. When officers ordered her to get out of the water, she complied.



The juvenile appeared to have several minor injuries, including cuts all over her hands. When asked, she said she accidentally inflicted these cuts on herself while handling a red guitar pick.



When officers asked what happened to the guitar pick, she said she lost it in the river. When asked why she was in the river at this hour, she said, “I was washing Wat off.”



She explained that Wat used to be her friend until she fed him. “When he eats, he gets big. When he gets big, he gets bad, just like his mom said.”



Despite extensive questioning, she was not able to elaborate satisfactorily.



When asked about her cousin’s injuries, she explained, “It was an accident. I got between her and Richie.” According to officers, Richie was the developmentally disabled son of her aunt. “I didn’t even hit her. She hit me, right here.”



The juvenile indicated her chest. 



Based on the age of the alleged aggressor relative to the age of the victim, officers declined to arrest her and transported her back to the home.



However, the aunt refused to take her back. She explained that the juvenile had been abandoned at the house by her mother over six weeks prior, and had broken several promises to come and reclaim her.



The juvenile corroborated these events.



As a result, the child was taken into state custody that evening.



The chid in question eventually became current T-Class Agent Rachele B.



While two decades lay between this incident and her onboarding with the Agency of Helping Hands, these events are of immense interest to the Agency.



It should be noted that these events only came to the Agency’s attention thanks to the contribution of Inmate 108 (Ward 3, “The What”).



When asked why she withheld this information, Rachele claimed that the memories were murky at best and due to their bizarre nature, she assumed they were either the result of a nightmare or of self-protective screen memories designed to shield her from recollections of trauma possibly inflicted upon her over that summer.



Due to grave doubts relating to her reliability, Rachele’s fellow T-Class Agent, Michael W. (Ward 1, “The Siren”) was assigned to assist during her interview.



It should be noted that Rachele was distressed and turned her own significant ability against her interviewer.



Based on the information resulting from their clash — specifically regarding Michael’s unauthorized contact with Inmate 17 (Ward 1, “The Harlequin”), Michael is confined to quarters pending an investigation.



Rachele spoke in Michael’s defense, claiming that the Harlequin frequently enters her own quarters without authorization, and while these intrusions are entertaining, they are unwelcome and largely annoying. She has expressed the likelihood that Michael regards these intrusions the same way.



After investigation, administration believes Rachele was telling the truth about her beliefs regarding the incident outlined below. 



She is strongly encouraged to reexamine her memories and recollections regarding other incidents from her past in a more critical and open-minded light, given her current knowledge and experience. 



**Interview Subject: The Narc**

**Classification String: Pending Release**

**Interviewers: Charles W. & Michael W.**

**Interview Date: 1/14/25**







When I was eleven, I lived with my aunt for a while.



There were eight kids between the ages of six and nineteen squeezed into that house, plus the friends of all those kids and a bunch of neighbors who came in and out as they pleased. Some were grownups. Some were strangers. One was this tiny, mangy little kid who just stood in the yard and watched us while my cousins laughed at his dirty hair and bad teeth. It was complete chaos and it was stressful as hell.



I know this is gross, but at that age I was prone to these stress-induced rashes. My skin turned red and rough, and kind of cracked apart. It always hurt like a bastard.



No one ever got to the bottom of it — that’s what happens when you grow up in and out of the system — but I noticed that I only ever got rashy after a confrontation. So I learned to avoid confrontations. 



Avoiding confrontation was not an option at my aunt’s house.



When people are stuck together like that, they pick someone to gang up on. The someone my cousins picked was the oldest boy, Richie.



Richie was both special and special. Special in that shittily euphemistic mid-2000s way, yes. But mostly he was special in a true way. He was my favorite cousin. We’d go for walks together and turn over rocks and logs to find bugs. Richie knew the names of every single bug, every flower, every bird, everything outside. I liked learning, and Richie was one of the best teachers I ever had.



My cousins were so mean to Richie. They didn’t really get physical with him, but they tore him down, manipulated him, took what few belongings he had, and needled him until he exploded which always got him in trouble. It was infuriating. Everything about the way he was treated made me madder than hell.





So from day one, I was running interference against people twice my size on his behalf. That turned me into a target too.



Thanks to those daily confrontations, my rash came back with a vengeance and didn’t go away. It was always at its worst after I got in an argument or even a fight for Richie.



I don’t like fighting — fights never solve my problems — but when no one in your life has ever protected you, you learn to fight. And I was a good fighter. I always have been. I’m strong for my size, mean as hell, and I think fighting dirty is fun.



But not as fun as fighting creepy. I love fighting creepy. Trust me, nothing stops a sixteen-year-old bully dead in his tracks like forcing him to talk about his childhood trauma in front of his bros.



I did that kind of thing a lot. 



I did it enough that my cousins started getting scared of me.



When a couple of people are scared of you, it makes you safer.



But when a bunch are scared of you, it makes you a lot less safe.



I sensed that, and learned to keep my distance.



I spent most of my time outside. I talked Richie into hanging around out there, too. It wasn’t hard. The property was gorgeous. It abutted a massive tract of old growth forest and a river cut along the boundary. 



The only problem was the bugs.



They swarmed everywhere, and I swear every last one of them was laser-focused on me.



Those bites were hell. 



They raised welts the size of quarters that melted into each other until my skin resembled a relief map of an alien planet. They got so itchy and painful I couldn’t sleep. At one point, I could barely move. The slightest movement sent every bite on fire again.



Of course everyone in the house knew and went out of their way to make it harder. That, combined with the way they kept treating Richie, sent the rash underneath the bites into overdrive, which sent the bites themselves into overdrive.



Being in the house somehow made it worse. I don’t know why. My aunt was a neat freak. Her house was actually the cleanest place I’d ever lived up until that point. But something about the air made me feel like I was coated in itching powder. 



By contrast, sunlight eased the discomfort. It didn’t make the swelling go down, but heat leached the itching out.



So even though the bugs that made my life hell were outside, I still lived outdoors. I found a sheltered spot by the river and spent most of my time sunning myself on the rocks.



One morning, I found a stranger was already sunning himself.



He was a skinny, kind of mangy little boy.



The same little boy, I realized, who lingered in the yard of my aunt’s house while my cousins made fun of him.



He was even shorter than me. There were bruises all over his arms and legs, his hair was dirty, and his teeth were in terrible shape. Even though he was bone-thin, his face was puffy. It sagged around his eyes and jowls.



Without even introducing himself, he asked, “Why do you lay in the sun like this? It hurts.”



“How do you know I lay in the sun?”



“I watch you. I got sunburned. Look.” He held out one of his stick-thin arms. Sure enough, a sunburn was blooming in real time. “But you’re not sunburned. I wonder why.” He hopped off the rock and practically bounced over. Before I could move, he grabbed a lock of my hair and threaded it through his fingers, turning it this way and that in the light. “Your hair is beautiful. Can I bring some back for my mom? Your hair looks like fire. Fire is her favorite. She can’t build fires anymore. The light makes her burn. She’d like fire that doesn’t burn. It might make her be nice to me.” 



I know how crazy this sounds.



And one hand, I was creeped the hell out. 



But on the other, this kid was tiny. He looked sick, like he was wasting away. In terms of size and strength, he was nothing compared to my cousins.



And honestly, I was kind of touched. He just looked so skinny and so sick. Bony and birdlike, his skin a collage of bruises and other marks. Worst was the papery, crinkled skin around the eyes. Those eyes were so sad.



What can I say? I was a goner.



I’ve always been a goner for people who need help. It’s why I wanted to be a cop.



So I let him cut off a chunk of my hair, which was already short and ragged anyway.



Even though his teeth were broken and translucent, the smile he gave just melted me.



I don’t have brothers, but I used to dream that I did. And it sounds crazy, but the smile that kid gave me came right out of those sibling dreams. 



Right as I smiled back, a bug landed on my arm. I smashed it reflexively, but missed and hit a bite instead. The slap made my rash network explode, and I howled.



The kid immediately grabbed my arm and started tracing the bites with a delicate fingertip, as familiar as if we were actually family. “These are really bad,” he said seriously. “But don’t worry, I can help. I’ll be back soon, okay? Wait here.”



With that, he vanished into the sun-drenched trees.



I stared stupidly for a minute, then trudged over to my sunning rock and spread out like a lizard, slowly relaxing as the heat soothed my skin.



I heard him come back before I saw him, but I didn’t sit up until I heard the river gravel grinding under his footsteps.



He held out a little food jar filled with something translucent and streaked with thin filaments. I reached for it, but he pulled away.



“No, lay back down,” he said. “I’ll put it on for you. It’s better that way.”



Bemused and more than a little uncomfortable, I did what he said. He perched beside me and started slathering it on, chatting excitedly about nothing and everything.



Some of that everything was highly unsettling.



“I’m not supposed to have any friends,” he said. 



“Why?”



“I can’t tell you. I’ll get in trouble. Besides, people always get scared when I tell them. I don’t want you to be scared of me.”



“What makes you think I’d be scared of you? You’re half my size and like what, eight?”



He laughed. “I’m way older than that.”



This was kind of the shock of the century. “No way.”



“Yes way. It’s just that my mom keeps me small. I get bad when I’m big.”



With a flourish, he slathered the last of the salve across my shoulders. I noticed the itching was better already.



“She would kill me if she knew about you.”



“Why? Who gets in trouble for having friends?”



“I wouldn’t get in trouble. She would kill me.”



Despite the heat, I shivered.



“You can’t tell her, okay?”



“How would tell her mom anything? I don’t know where you live. I don’t even know your name.”



“It’s Wat. Is your medicine working? It looks like it’s working. How do you feel?”



I flexed experimentally, then pushed down on a swiftly-deflating welt. “Tons better.”



He gave me that smile again, the one that made me melt. “Good. I made it for you. I used your hair, and my mom’s.”



“Gross!”



“It doesn’t matter if it’s gross as long as it works.”



I couldn’t argue with that. I mean I wanted to, but I couldn’t.



We played for a while, and had so much fun that I didn’t even notice when the sun started to set. That was bad. Dusk is the worst time for bugs.



No sooner did the thought cross my mind than a mosquito landed on my arm. Before I could react, Wat smashed it.



“I have to go home,” he said. “But first I have to wash off in the river. If I don’t, my mom will smell you and I’ll get in trouble.”



He took off his shirt and waded into the river, submerging himself.



I was worried. The river was strong and Wat was so tiny. I was scared he’d get carried away, so I lingered on the bank until he popped up again.



“Why are you still here?” he snapped. “I can’t wash you off if you’re still here!”



Feeling stupid and kind of hurt, I took off for my aunt’s house.



I walked in on my cousin Briana tormenting Richie. Rage bloomed, and my recently de-rashed skin started to prickle.



I launched myself in between them, shoving Briana with enough force to make her stumble, and pulled Richie into the kitchen. I sat there with him until bedtime. By then, my skin was so itchy I wanted to cry.



I couldn’t sleep because of it.



The second the sun rose, I crept out of the house and went down to the river. Sunrise is almost as bad for bugs as dusk, but even the bugs were preferable to what the air in the house did to my skin. 



To my mingled delight and discomfort, Wat was waiting on the sunning rock. He gave his big, bright smile.



I smiled back.



And just like that, we became the best of friends. It took about a week for Wat to be my favorite person even though he was little.



All day every day, we played and we talked. Some of the things we talked about were fun. Most were innocuous. Some of it was creepy as hell.



The creepiest things were about his mother. He said the bruises on his arms came from bites, and she bit him whenever he started to grow. He said she wouldn’t let him grow or have friends or go to school or even eat.



“That’s why I’m so skinny,” he said sadly. “If I eat, I get big. If I get big, I can get away. She won’t ever let that happen. She says I’m a broken boy who breaks everything else, and staying small is the only way to stop me.”



That was the worst, but it wasn’t all.



I don’t remember all of it or even most of it anymore, but I do remember that Wat slowly started pushing boundaries.



He asked weird questions that make my skin crawl even though I didn’t understand why. When he did that, he’d always smile. But that smile didn’t make me melt. It just made me scared.



One afternoon, he told me about the time he found a dying lady in the river.



“It wasn’t by your rock.” He spoke rapidly, and his sunken eyes were brighter than stars. “But it was pretty close. I could show you. She wasn’t dead yet, but she was pretty close. There were marks on her hands like rotten spider bites. Big old holes. I found a stick and poked it into the holes. Then I had to go far away to wash her off so my mom wouldn’t find out about her. When I came back to look at her again, she was dead.”



That night I had a nightmare about a dead lady clinging to the bottom of my sunning rock. There were holes in her hands, gaping wounds the size and shape of the bug bite welts on mine. She was crying that the sun hurt the holes.



I didn’t go back to the river for a few days after that.



But every hour I spent inside the house made Richie’s life worse. It got to the point where I had to guard him every minute of every day. Finally I realized the others were picking on him just to get at me, so I finally gave up one morning and left the house.



Since it had been a week, I figured — well, I hoped — that Richie had given up on me. And when I got to my rock by the river, he wasn’t there.



I finally relaxed, and clambered up onto my rock.



But minutes later —



“Where were you?”



I shot up.



Wat peered at me from the tree line, skinnier and frailer than ever in the morning light.  I noticed a fresh bruise peeking over his collarbone from under his shirt, and several more on his legs.



“What happened to you?” I asked.



“My mom smelled you on me,” he said mournfully. “I got in big, big, big trouble.”



My mind raced the way children’s minds do when trying to make sense of something incomprehensible. “Maybe, if you brought her out to meet me, she wouldn’t be so—”



“No. She never comes out of the house. Not since she made me small.”



“Well…what if I go to your house to meet her?”



“Never. She’d tell you things about me, and you’d be so scared you’d run away forever. You already ran away from me even though all I did was tell you something I didn’t even do. If she talks to you, you won’t be my friend.” To my astonishment, a tear trickled down his face. “You’re my only friend.”



I’d never wanted to protect anyone so much, not even Richie.



“How can I be afraid of you?” I asked. “I could snap you in half. And even if I couldn’t, I’ll be your friend forever, no matter what she says.”



“No, you won’t. I hate her. She’s horrible and *super* scary. She’s super tall, and has one eye and big sharp teeth. She eats everything. I don’t ever get to eat. I got so big back when I used to eat, big enough to make her stop. She hated that. She doesn’t even feed me.”



“Come on, Wat. Your mom has to feed you.”



“She doesn’t. When I eat I get big. When I get big I get bad. She doesn’t like it when I’m bad, so she doesn’t let me get big. I haven’t been big in years and years and years. I haven’t eaten since before you were even born.”



"That doesn’t make sense.”



“You only think that because you’re stupid.”



“I’d rather be stupid than a liar.”



“*I’m not a liar*!” Without warning, drove a fist into my stomach.



I stumbled back, gasping. 



“Wait.” His voice was timid. “Wait. I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to. I’m sorry. It’s because I’m broken, just like my mom says. I’m sorry.”



As soon as I caught my breath, I turned and ran.



“No! No! I’m sorry! Don’t leave! You can’t leave! You have to come back! You have to be my friend! You have to be my friend because you’re just like me!”



I didn’t stop running.



But that night, I had another nightmare. It was about Wat desperately trying to eat nothing, biting down so hard on empty spoons that his teeth shattered. As he cried, a huge shadow loomed in the shadows behind him, eyes glinting in the dim.



So as soon as I woke up, I packed a battered plastic grocery bag with all the food I could find and set off for the sunning rock.



Even though it was early, Wat was waiting.



He bolted toward me and wrapped me in an unpleasantly tight hug. He was so tiny his head barely brushed my chest.



“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m really sorry. Don’t leave me again.”



I disentangled myself as gently as I could, then dumped the bag of food on the rock.



He looked at me, awestruck. “This is your food? You brought me *your* food?”



He dived right in, eating so fast and so greedily it made me nervous.



When he was done, his skin wasn’t quite so translucent.



Then we played.



To my relief, he didn’t tell me anything else about his mother or dead women in the river.



When he came back the next day, I noticed he had grown. He was almost as tall as me.



This was our ritual for the next few days. I fed him, he ate like a frenzied alligator, and we played along the river.



On the fifth day, he ate like always, then settled back with a satisfied sigh. “Thank you,” he said. “It’s so nice to eat your food.”



We sat in content silence for a little while. 



Then—



“Now that you’ve shown me what you eat, I want to show you what I eat. Come on!”



I thought this was his way of telling me I was going to meet his mom, so I followed him down the river.



We ran until an RV came into view through the trees, then he pulled me down into the undergrowth to hide.



Through the grass, I saw two parents, an old lady who had to be a grandma, and four kids. One of them looked a lot like me. Same short red hair, same build, same age, even the same face shape.



Wat pointed at her. “See?” he whispered. “See her?”



“Yeah. What about her?”



“She looks just like you. That’s what I like to eat.”



My stomach plummeted to the center of the earth. I turned to look at him. He was watching her with an expression I’d never seen. Like a hunting dog fixating on prey, except he wasn’t a hunting dog. He was a boy.



And besides, hunting dogs don’t smile.



I also noticed that he had grown even bigger. He didn’t even look like a kid anymore. He looked almost as old as Richie.



I jumped to my feet and bolted back home, crashing my way through the trees, oblivious to weeds and vines and rocks, even to the bugs.



When I got back, I caught Briana tormenting Richie yet again.



And for once, Richie was fighting back.



I ran towards her, so mad I barely noticed that my skin was itching like crazy. That it was the kind of itching that actually drives you crazy.



I caught her by the arm. She threw me off, accidentally smashing Richie across the nose.



With a shriek, I launched myself at Briana. She swung at me instinctively, fist colliding into my chest.



Her eyes widened.



Then she pulled away, cradling her hand. From the sickening way it flopped, I knew something was broken.



And I didn’t care, not least because my chest didn’t even hurt.



While she screamed, I grabbed Richie by the hand and dragged him outside. I led him to the river where he immediately proceeded to happily flip over rocks and logs to inspect bugs.



I wanted to flip over rocks and logs and inspect bugs too, but I felt too tired and somehow too old. My skin was itching so badly that I started daydreaming about Wat’s salve. 



For once, Wat didn’t come.



When the sun set, I finally took Richie home.



The second I walked through the door, my aunt started yelling at me. I yelled back. She threatened to send me to jail for assaulting her daughter.



Richie started to cry. I wanted to cry too. Jail terrified me. Jail was where my dad went. Jail was where you go when your life was over. Jail was where you went when you got in trouble, and I hated getting in trouble.



I burst into tears and ran right out the door again.



I ran all the way back to the river, intending to sleep on my sunning rock, but a man was standing on it, tall and skinny as a tree.



I started to back away, but he turned around.



It was Wat.



Even though he was tall, his face was exactly the same.



“There you are,” he panted. “Did you bring more food?”



“No.”



“Please, I need more food. I’m so hungry. Please.”



“I don’t have any. I can’t get it either.”



His face contorted and he stalked toward me, baggy eyes bulging. “If you don’t feed me I’ll eat you. I’ll bite into your skin and tear it right off the bone, you stupid stinking little—”



“Like you’d be able to break my skin with those shitty teeth of yours,” I snarled.



He stopped in his tracks, mouth agape.



Then he laughed.



When he was done, he looked at me closely and frowned. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”



That’s the thing about Wat. That summer — hell, that year — he was the only person who ever asked if I was okay.



So I told him everything. About Richie, about my aunt, even about Briana and how I’d hurt her without meaning to.



When I described Briana’s hand, his eyes widened. He leaned in, eager and somehow possessive.



“*You* did that? You? I knew you could. I know what you are. What did it look like?” The indecent excitement in his voice made me recoil. “Did it bleed? Did the bone break out? Could you see her bones?”



“Shut up!” I screamed.



He withered and drew away like a beaten dog. “Sorry. I’m sorry.”



“You better be.”



It’s because I’m broken, just like my mom says. She said that to me today. That’s why I’m out here after dark. She tried to kill me, so I ran away.”



The emotional whiplash was such a struggle. I was angry, I was sad, and I was scared of Wat. More scared that I’ve been of anyone.



But here he was, acting more scared than me.



“Why did she try to hurt you?”



“She didn’t try to hurt me. She tried to *kill* me. She’s mad I’m getting bigger. My mom. She ate me today with her big long teeth. That’s how she eats me, with her teeth. She eats all my growing so I stay small, but that growing has to go somewhere, and it goes into her. Now she’s so tall and her teeth are so big. Look what her teeth did today.”



He stretched his legs out. Even by the dim light of the moon, I saw massive, oozing bites bleeding all over his skin.



Crickets sang, nightbirds called, mosquitoes whined in my ears, and my skin pulsed with itch and ache. The river whispered through it all like something alive.



“Your mom did that to you?”



“Yes.”



I thought about the cracked red skin on my chest. I thought of how Briana tried to punch me and broke her hand instead.



I wondered what would happen if Wat’s mom tried to punch me. If she’d break her hand, too. I wondered if I could break her hand myself. If I could break more than that.



Then I shook myself. “Wat, you have to tell somebody.”



“I can’t, because then she’ll tell you about me and you’ll be scared. I don’t want you to be scared of me.”



“You have to do something about her!”



“I can’t. She’s a monster. Nothing can hurt her except another monster, a strong one. And she made sure I’ll never be strong again.”



He dissolved into tears.



Feeling scared but sorry for him, I sat down and put my arm around him. He clung to me so tightly it hurt. “You’re making me strong. Did you know that? I’m growing. It’s not just your food, it’s you. That’s why she’s mad. She’s so mad. You have no idea how mad. You make me grow so much that she can’t make me small again.”



“You have grown a lot,” I said.



That made him laugh through his tears. “Don’t hate me like she does. Please don’t, even I say bad things sometimes.”



“Everybody does.”



“It’s just because I’m broken, not because I want to eat you. I don’t really want to eat you. Well…maybe a little. Just a tiny bit. I can’t help it. I thought that’s why I liked you at first, because I wanted to eat you. But now I know better. I know I don’t like you because I can eat you. I like you because you can eat with me. I’ve never met anyone who can eat with me.”



Gooseflesh erupted, but I didn’t dare move.



His voice took on a peculiar, keening quality. “I think you could even eat more than me. Sometimes I think you could even eat my mom.”



It took all my strength not to throw him off. “What are you talking about?”



“I can’t tell you yet because it’ll scare you. That means you can’t eat with me yet. Not yet. You need to work on yourself first. That’s what my mom used to say. I need to work on myself. We need to work on you. We need to work on making you more like me. I don’t think it’ll take long. And once you’re more like me, you can get rid of my mom. Then I’ll never be small again.”



“I don’t want to be more like you.”



“I want you to be,” he said sadly.



“I want to meet your mom.”



“She’ll hate you. She hates everyone who’s like me. She’ll hate you so much.” His lip quivered, then split into a smile. “I want to see her hate you. Come on.”



I followed him along the river and through the night forest to a tiny white house. Battered tinfoil filled the windows, and all the doors were boarded up. Vines wormed under the roof and the porch, which bloomed with slick dark patches mold.



This couldn’t possibly be Wat’s house. No one could live here. It was a literal biohazard.



So what did that mean? Was Wat tricking me? Was he planning something worse?



“How do you even get in and out?” I whispered.



He grabbed my wrist and pulled me to a cellar hatch. “Through here. Hurry! If she smells you before we get inside, she’ll wake up!” He pulled open the door and guided me down.



The smell was like something alive and malevolent, nauseating and almost disorienting. The air was dripping, stinking, terribly damp. That dampness got inside. It clung to my nose and eyes and mouth, soaking into those membranes as it beaded up on my skin like sweat.



Together, we crept through the house.



The rest of it was as damp as the cellar and just as dark except for haphazard patches of moonlight bleeding through the rotting boards. Vermin scurried loudly, throwing wild shadows against the walls.



As we reached the stairs, a voice drifted down, low, tragic, and inhuman. It sounded even less human than Wat looked.



And he didn’t look human anymore.



When we reached the landing, Wat dropped to his belly and surged across the threadbare carpet, a fleet shadow slithering across patches of moonlight.



He stopped in front of a moldy door through which the low, inhuman crying emanated, and knocked. “Mama?” His voice was bright and boyish. “Mama, I need your help. I was bad again. I made another friend.”



 A pained groan, another sob.



“I’m sorry, Mama. It’s because I’m broken. That’s all. I’m sorry.” His voice sounded weepy, but he was smiling.



From behind the door came a whistling intake of breath, followed by the heaviest, slowest footsteps I’ve ever head.



The door opened, and I gasped.



Framed within was something so huge it bent almost in half to peer through. It was huge and hunched and falling apart, with a single bright eye sunken in an enormous withered face. Monstrous teeth glint dimly in the moonlight.



“Mama,” Wat said, “look at my friend. Look at her hair. I love her hair.”



He shoved me forward.



The thing gave a low, awful, roar that made my ribcage thrum. I was afraid my bones would shatter the way high notes shatter glass in movies. Everything hurt, even my skin. Especially my skin.



The thing bent even lower and stumbled out of the bedroom, howling not with sorrow this time, but rage.



I reared back and tripped, falling hard on my wrists. Carpet grit bit into my palms. I kicked back as far as I could, until I was trapped against the wall in a patch of moonlight.



Wat’s terrible mother loomed in front of me, a hideous shadow with a glowing eye and those terrible shining teeth she used to eat him. That she would use to eat me.



Then she turned on Wat.



Her clawed hands, hands so big and monstrous they could snap my neck, tightened around his. “She’s a baby,” she moaned. “You’re my baby. You’re supposed to stay a baby so you won’t hurt more babies.”



She raised him into the air, enormous arms trembling with the strain. Wat keened and choked, legs kicking wildly, throwing frantic shadows that blocked the moonlight. Tears streamed down his face as he died.



And was dying.



His mother was killing him, just like he said.



My brain hurt. My bones hurt. My heart hurt.



Most of all, my skin hurt.



As the sparking, overwhelming pain in my skin reached its zenith, I hurled myself at his mother and knocked her into the wall.



Wat fell to the floor with a stuttering gasp.



His mother roiled bonelessly, trying to throw me off, but she was brittle and soft and so, so weak. I didn’t understand. How could she have been strong enough to attack Wat?



I squirmed away and kicked her in the chest. Something gave under my foot with a snap, emitting a cloud that reeked of dust and blood.



“You’re a baby,” she moaned. “I keep him from hurting babies.” Her hands flew to my shoulders, enormous claws nicking my skin. I thrashed away. They caught in my shirt, shredding it and exposing the agonized flesh beneath.



We both froze. 



There were lights on my skin. 



Red lights, the same color as the sunsets, clinging to my skin and reflecting in the depths of the mother’s single cloudy eye.



She stretched out a clawed finger and tapped the light on my skin, one, two, three times. It sounded like she was tapping glass. I didn’t even feel it except for a slight, almost pleasant pressure.



“How sharp,” she moaned. “How sharp and how strong, and you just a baby. I’m so sorry.”



Then she slid a long, jagged nail beneath the light and peeled it off.



The sparking, shocking pain made me scream.



Wat’s mother raised it to the moonlight for inspection. It wasn’t a light. It was solid, thick and surprisingly big, a little larger than a guitar pick. Only I knew it wasn’t a guitar pick. I knew what it was, somehow.



It was a scale.



A giant scale that shone like fire. Even the silver moon couldn’t bleach the fire out.



She ran it across the spongy, dead-looking flesh of her thumb. The skin split apart easily and bled something dark and thick and full of faint, shimmering lights. 



Wat’s voice echoed in my head. *Nothing can hurt her except another monster, a strong one.*



She shoved me away and turned her massive, broken body toward Wat like a crippled spider. She pinned him to the ground and held the shining scale she’d pulled off my skin to Wat’s throat.



Wat moaned. His mother sobbed, teeth bared in a grimace of agony. “It will keep you small,” she wept.



I staggered to my feet and knocked her arm right as she nicked Wat’s throat.



The scale went flying. Wat twisted upward and caught it. Then he turned on his mother and pinned her — and he could because he was so big, even bigger than she was now, how had he gotten so big — and sliced it across her throat.



She gave a soft, mournful cry.



Blood welled up and cascaded. It was dark and full of shining things that looked like moonlight on dark water.



Her hands flew to Wat’s throat, but weakly this time. The shimmering dark pool that couldn’t possibly be blood spread down her throat and across the carpet.



“A baby,” she gurgled, then fell still.

Wat pushed her off and turned to me. He was bleeding too, practically hemorrhaging through the small nick his mother made. His blood was dark like hers. Instead of moonlit silver, it glittered with something dim, like sullen fire. The color of the scale plucked off my skin, only dull instead of bright.



As he bled, Wat shrank. 



He shrank and shrank and shrank until he was the size of a toddler. He withered and withered and withered until he looked like the sickest thing on earth.



I jerked away.

“Don’t run,” he whined. His voice was low and corrupt like his mother’s. “You’re like me. I knew it as soon as I saw you. You knew it too. We’re exactly alike. We’re both strong. We’re supposed to eat together.”



Another gush of sullen fire erupted from his puncture, taking the last of his strength with it. He fell to his knees. “Help. Please. Before I shrink down into nothing.”



With each syllable, more dying molten light gushed from his throat



He reached up again. His hand wasn’t much bigger than mine now, trembling in that patch of bone-colored light.



I knocked it to the side, plucked the scale from his fingers, and ran out of the house.



By the time I crawled out of the cellar, coated in dust and cobwebs, the terrible foul humidity had left me with drenched hair, damp clothes, and immense difficulty breathing.



But for the first time in weeks, my skin felt soft.



When I reached the river, I threw the scale into the river and jumped in myself, scrubbing every inch of my skin with sand. Washing the house off. Washing him off.



And then the cops came.



I told myself none of this was real.



I still don’t think it is.



I vacillate between it being a screen memory for some kind of crazy that summer, or a series of nightmares. I always had nightmares. I still do.



And that’s why I didn’t tell you. I didn’t think it was relevant. I didn’t think it was real. It must have been, though, because that’s the first time I grew scales.



I guess it’s pretty obvious that my scale is what Wat and his mother used to kill each other.



Is that why you want me to grow them back? Because only a strong monster can kill other strong monsters?



Fuck you guys.



Seriously, fuck you.

After that, I turned on Mikey because I’m kind of a bitch when I’m mad and asked him why the hell the Harlequin keeps talking about him.



He said, “Because we have a lot to talk about. You’d like to hear it too, it’s all about how to get the hell out of here with as many of us as possible.”



I realized what I was doing and stopped, but it was too late.



Mikey got confined to quarters, and so did I.



I got released this morning with full privileges. He has not.



Which is kind of ironic, because yesterday morning the Harlequin came to have an unauthorized conversation with me. 



He crawled up from under my bed with a clothespin on his nose.



“What in the hell?” I asked.



He tapped it. “It keeps your miasma out. Now, my wife who I hate has messages for you.”



In spite of everything, I perked up. I’ve been trying to talk to the Knotwitch for days, but she keeps refusing.



“But first,” he said, “I have a message of my own. That was very cruel of you to do to Michael. If he weren’t the director’s son, he’d be in a great deal of trouble. Don’t ever do anything like that to him again.”



“I won’t.”



“Good. Here is the first message from my wife who I hate: Everyone meets monsters. Not every day or even every week, but often. Most monsters — even the ones here — mostly look like people, so the vast majority of people never realize what they’re dealing with. It takes a monster to see another monster right away. You haven’t met any more or less monsters than anyone else you’ve met. You just see them. And they see you. Everyone longs to be seen, and you see everyone but yourself more clearly than most.”



I have to give him credit: This was an answer to a question I didn’t even know how to ask.



“This is her second message: You have loved many of these monsters. You most loved the ones you knew were monsters. Even that terrible thing with no name? You loved it enough to help it. You loved it enough not to kill it when you had the chance. A handful of little redheads suffered badly because of your love. And that’s okay. You didn’t know. You have a tendency to make sure you don’t know about important things. But we can work on that.”



I felt too numb to answer.



“This is her third message: It’s okay to love broken things. You always have. This is not the time to stop.”



He scooted over and put an arm around my shoulder. I didn’t even have the energy to shrug him off. “This is her fourth message: The thing too terrible to name wanted you to be more like it. You still loved it. Why can't you extend grace to a less terrible thing who wants to be more like you?”



“Your wife can fuck right off.”



“Agreed, but that doesn’t mean she’s wrong. Now, that’s all I can bear to talk to you about today because her message made your miasma so strong even my clothespin can’t keep it out of my nose. Clear it, darling girl, and quickly. You have work to do.”



With that, he crawled back under the bed.



I’m so tired.



And I haven’t even been able to sleep because my scales are itching like a bastard.
