I’m typing this now to let you know I could not read what was in this. Underneath I hopefully copy and pasted what was on a .txt file, inside a thumb drive I found down here. God save me.



Observation Data Segment - 14/8/XXXX

Family has moved in as normal. Inhabitants of 1788 Willow Ln are the first subjects we have to test the Lazarus theory in earnest. Family took great interest today in the mirror. Perhaps not hiding the exposed tiles was a mistake.


Observation Data Segment - 27/8/XXXX

Family is comprised of Father, Mother, Son and Daughter. Dog is also present. All four stay at the home most of the day outside of school and work hours. The effects of Lazarus are seemingly delayed to an extent unforeseen. In previous testing it took hold 3 days earlier than currently observed. Hypothesis currently stands that knowing about Lazarus incites symptoms sooner than what naturally would occur. This would also explain the first instance of Lazarus.


Observation Data Segment - 29/8/XXXX

Son (Icebreaker), now sits in front of mirror from 3am until 6:45am every morning. No recollection or mention of this behavior to family. Seems well rested despite lack of sleep. Theory is running that Lazarus is activating in him first, however this is an undocumented symptom.


Observation Data Segment - 4/9/XXXX

Lazarus has influenced Icebreaker to begin process. Icebreaker now stares at mirror from 1am-6:45am daily. Parents are concerned about the growing pustules on Icebreakers back. Local doctor has been informed not to interfere and diagnose acne. Placebo pills have been prescribed to Icebreaker.


Observation Data Segment - 9/9/XXXX

Icebreaker claImed by Lazarus. Different method this time, the bulbs growing from Icebreaker sprouted appendages and forcibly dragged Icebreaker to the mirror. Screams from Icebreaker and pustules not heard by family. Family unaware son existed the next morning and questioned the “guest room” design.


Observation Data Segment - 10/9/XXXX

Icebreaker born again. Inside facility ——— Lazarus has spit him out. This is unprecedented. The boy is delirious and shows little comprehension of his previous life or learned skills. Back is scarred and void of any growths. When we’re not looking he “melts” according to researchers.
Family still shows no behaviors indicative of missing their son. Icebreaker locked in testing bay until further directive.


Observation Data Segment - 29/9/XXXX

We thought Lazarus may have left family due to unforeseen incident. Icebreaker is now a creature capable of more than we can contain here, was sent to facility “Up North”.

Daughter (Lighter) is now twitching in front of mirror from 2am-5am. Unnaturally.


Observation Data Segment - 1/10/XXXX

Lighter quickly showed symptoms and willingly crawled into mirror. She twisted like a barber shop pole inside of it. She laughed…Lazarus laughed. I felt a tap on my shoulder after she vanished and there was nobody in the observation deck. Lazarus may have ability to transcend camera footage now? Family now questions daughter’s bedroom. Shows no sign of missing daughter.


Observation Data Segment - 29/10/XXXX

Lazarus was a mistake. Lighter breached containment after being spat out. They were ALL spat out. Icebreaker vanished from “Up North”. Lazarus mirror has been scheduled for destruction.


Observation Data Segment - 30/10/XXXX

It is in all reflections now. Lazarus has grown. Do not let it see you. I will never atone for my own willingness to see this through. I can’t stand to look at the mass outside the door. They melted together. All the subjects. All the researchers. They’re laughing at me too.
