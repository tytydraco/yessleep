I boarded my flight, walked to the very back of the plane, and kindly told the passengers sitting in my aisle that my seat was 32E. After standing up to allow me to pass through, I took my seat, set down my bag between my legs, and put my headphones over my ears. 

The flight attendant made an announcement that we would be taking off soon and everyone needed to switch their devices to airplane mode. 

Before I made the switch, I sent a text to my boyfriend and family letting them know that I was about to take off, and that I couldn’t wait to see them at the hotel. 

I turned on my new Spotify playlist I made the night before, leaned back, and reminisced about all of the fun memories I have made at this little, quaint hotel on the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. 

For years now, my family has taken an annual December trip there to enjoy a few days in the sunshine before we all go back to snowy upstate NY. This year is particularly exciting because it is the first time my boyfriend will be joining us. He travels a lot for work, so since he was already in California leading up to the trip, he decided to meet me in Cabo instead of flying back to Chicago to travel with me. 

The red seatbelt light flashed above my seat and the flight attendant told us to prepare for take off. Shit, I forgot to turn my phone on airplane mode. 

I opened my phone, and quickly parsed through the emoji-littered texts from my family wishing me safe travels, before I saw a text from a random number. 

I opened it and it was a picture of me in the airport sitting down at the gate with a Starbucks in hand. The text said “See you soon :)” 

What the fuck? 

My heart started racing and my iPhone case became damp from the sweat dripping down my fingers. I googled the number to see who this might be, and all of a sudden I hear: 

“Ma’am! We are taking off right now. I see you texting. Please turn your phone to airplane mode NOW.” 

I jumped up and profusely apologized. I reluctantly turned my phone to airplane mode, and went back to the text conversation with the unknown number. I couldn’t stop staring at the photo of me. 

Who could this possibly be? It must be someone on this flight, but I didn’t recognize anyone when I walked to my seat.  Granted, I wasn’t paying much attention to the people around me. 

Maybe it’s a friend of mine who is surprising me? But why would I not have their number saved? 

My mind started racing with possibilities. Any plans I had of enjoying a relaxing flight flew out the window. 

I couldn’t just listen to Taylor Swift and play crosswords on my phone anymore. I could hardly sit still in my seat. I needed to get to the bottom of this ASAP, but, first, I needed WiFi. 

——————————————————————

As soon as we were up in the air, I checked for WiFi. 

Right below the airline’s wifi, I saw a private network called “YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE EMG”. 

I covered my mouth and audibly gasped. 

EMG? Those are my initials. 

This can’t be a coincidence, right? 

If this isn’t a subtle message towards me, why else would someone name their wifi network that? I couldn’t come up with a logical reason. 

I tried not to let my uncontrollable thoughts take over and focused on the task at hand. I logged into the airline’s WiFi, paid the $20/hr, and, all of a sudden, I received two more messages from the unknown number. 

The first message is another picture of me, but this time, I am sitting in my seat on the plane. The text says “Have a safe flight! Can’t wait to spend more time with you.” 

WHAT THE FUCK? 

More time with me? What does that mean? Have I met this person before? 

I couldn’t tell how far away the photo was taken since it was intentionally zoomed in on my face. 

I barely lifted myself out of my seat and scanned the rest of the plane. It was hard to see any faces, and I couldn’t pinpoint anyone that I even remotely recognized. 

I sat back down and started shaking in my seat. I needed to somehow calm down or else I was going to have a panic attack. 

I waved the flight attendant down and requested a double gin and tonic. I was going to need it before I even looked at the next text I received. 

The flight attendant brought over the drink with a smile and asked if I needed anything else. I shook my head “no” and started drinking as fast as I could. 

I bet the people sitting next to me thought I was having some type of mental breakdown. They wouldn’t be wrong - I was having a mental breakdown. 

I finished the drink before the flight attendant even fully walked away, and stared down at my phone. 

Before I hit the Messages app, another text from that number popped up. I swiped down to read it and it said: “Gin and tonic? Great choice! Don’t drink too much. We have a long day ahead.” 

I almost fainted. 

Someone is clearly watching me on this plane. Who could it possibly be?

And “long day ahead”? What do they mean by that? I am scheduled to arrive at 6pm and am supposed to have dinner with my family at 8pm. 

I’m debating whether I should respond to this person or not. That’s when I realized I haven’t even opened up the other text I received earlier. 

I go back to our conversation, and see another picture. The picture is fairly grainy. I zoom in and noticed it’s a pool with two kids swimming. Wait a second. 

That’s not just two kids. That’s ME and my brother - at the Cabo hotel pool! This must’ve been from years ago. How could someone possibly get this photo? 

Unless .. they took it? 

WHO IS THIS PERSON?

I then read the text underneath the photo and chills went down my spine:

“You were always so cute as a child. Looking forward to our time together now that you are an adult.”
