About a year ago, I wanted to take a camping trip with some friends. I went camping a lot when I was growing up, but hadn't been on a proper camping trip in about 15 years. We didn't have money for it anymore, and eventually I turned into an emo teen who refused to exit my house unless completely necessary. I still loved the mountains, I just wanted to see them outside my window, not be on top of them. But at age 22, I decided I needed to go after all these years. I called up some friends, we made a plan, and had it set to go after only a few weeks.



I called Tom and Rick, my two best friends growing up, first. I just made a three way call with both of them and set it up.



"Tommy, Ricky! Boys, how do you feel about a a camping trip?" I asked, doing an impression of Tom's dad. I had mastered my impression of Henry when we were seventeen, simply by grabbing my nose and lowering the pitch of my voice a bit. Tom fucking hated it.



"I'm down. Where are we going?" Rick said immediately, cutting of Tom before he could yell at me for the impression.



"The Book Cliffs. They're in the southern end of Utah, near where my Grandparents live." I replied. I'd been camping in the Book Cliffs a few times as a kid, but my family usually went a bit further south, to the La Sal mountains on the Colorado border.



"Can I get a fuckin' word please? When are you wanting to go?" Tom asked, just as annoyed by my impression as he was by Rick cutting him off.



"Literally the moment we all have time. I'm not going without y'all, but I'm gonna get Erin, the Hoff brothers, and Greg, assuming he'll leave his fuckin' house." I said, still doing the impression.



"Dude fucking stop. You know that shit bugs me" Tom said.



"And that's exactly why I do it. So are you in or not?" I replied. He'd never get me to stop that impression. Never never never.



"Yeah man, I guess I'm in. We'll need to coordinate days off with everyone, so get that shit figured out, and let me know. I gotta go get some lunch while I've still got time. Peace out boys."



"See ya, lover." Rick said, laughing.



"Bye son, have a good day at school." I said, still doing the voice.



"Fuck you, Jason." he said as he hung up. Rick and I giggled a bit before going completely silent. We said nothing for several seconds, waiting to see who would break the silence first.



"I'm gonna show you my love bone if you don't speak, Jason" Rick finally said.



"I'm gonna call the cops if you threaten me with that again, Richard" I said, laughing.



"Hey now, 'Richard'? Don't be that fuckin' mean dude" Ricky said, also laughing.



"Alright man, I'm gonna call Erin while she's on break. Talk to ya later." I said. Talking to Erin was going to be a bit of a pain, and I wanted to get that out of the way. Everyone else would be pretty easy to convince, aside from Greg, but Erin was still a bit terrified of bugs, so camping was not her thing. Her wife, Bea, however, fucking loved it.



"I love you dear." Rick said and quickly hung up. He was always like that. He'd come out as gay back in 8th grade, and while his immediate family was very supportive, his extended family was not, so while they were around, we'd flirt with each other and hold hands to make them uncomfortable. Neither I nor Tom were gay, but it was our way of showing our friend support. Even after he didn't need it from us anymore, he still did it all the time. Just kinda became our thing.



As soon as that call was over, I called Erin. She didn't answer, but Bea did, and she was all too happy to agree to go. Much easier than I'd expected. Next I called Mike and Mark Hoff, and they were in too. Mike would be bringing along his wife, Carrie, literally the sweetest human being to ever live. I don't think that woman had a single bone in her body that felt anything other than love and compassion for everyone. She'd only been part of the group for about six months at that point, but she was immediately amazing to have along. Everyone loved her.



Finally, I called Greg. Greg was a software engineer, and a homebody. He didn't even like to go shopping. Everything delivered. It's not that he wouldn't go outside, or leave ever. He just preferred to be in his own space. He usually hosted any events we did, outside of going to the bar. Surprisingly he was probably the most extroverted of us. He just didn't like to leave his house much.



"Gregory! What are ya up to?" I said excitedly. I really wanted to sell this trip to him, and the energy had to be high.



"Playing Kenshi. What's poppin' on your end good buddy?" he said. He always had a way of bringing the mood up when he spoke. Really good dude.



"Tom, Rick, Erin, the Hoffs, and I are planning a camping trip to the Book Cliffs down south. We want you to come with. We're gonna smoke some green, drink some brewgals, and party for a couple days. Are you in?" He was quiet after I spoke. I was getting ready to argue with him, but he didn't have the response I was expecting.



"Yeah dawg, prolly. I'll have to get some shit set aside, but it's been a while since we all kicked it." I was flabbergasted.



"I was expecting some resistance. I've got an entire arsenal and you just wasted it." I said, a little disappointed.



"I'm tryna get outta the house a bit more these days. It'll be fun" He said. We talked for a few more minutes, said our goodbyes, and I made a groupchat. It took about two weeks to get everything in order, and we had a plan. We'd meet at my place, pile into my truck with all of our gear, head to a town called Green River, gather any last minute supplies, and head up to a canyon I found while researching the trip called Tushar Canyon, drive up to the top where the trees start, camp for three days, and head home.



A week after the plan was finished, we met up at my place. Erin did not seem impressed.



"Dude you call my wife? That's how you stick me into this? You're an asshole." The anger in her voice was obviously forced. She'd been in the group chat, so she'd already had plenty of time to argue about it, I think she just wanted to reiterate the point.



"Yeah I'm a fuckin' scumbag. However, it's not my fault Bea answered, blame her." I said, grinning.



"Don't throw me under the bus, Jason. She and I already had that talk, and frankly, I'm her wife. You're gonna get the brunt of the anger either way." Bea said, laughing. I knew she wasn't actually all that mad. Just had to make a fuss about it to keep up appearances.



"Are y'all gonna be fighting the whole trip?" asked Tom, who looked extremely tired. It was seven in the morning, and the heavy, dark clouds overhead didn't help with the light levels, but I loved it. Nothing like a rainy morning in October.



"Nah we already made up." said Bea, still loading coolers full of food and/or drinks into my truck bed.



"Oooooh angry lesbian sex. That sounds like such a great time!" said Rick, who was very quickly smacked in the back of the head by Erin.



"Don't think that just because you're gay that you get a pass on being gross." she said.



"No, I get that pass because I am Ricky, God King of the Universe, Slayer of Beasts, and Sexer of Men!" He shouted, doing his best kingly pose. Everyone laughed a little.



"Enough man. Let's just get this shit loaded and hit the road." said Mark. He'd been really quiet all morning. All three Hoffs had been, for that matter. I wondered what was going on with them, but just assumed that it was because it was early. Greg and I had always been the only two that liked early morning.



We finished packing everything in, and piled into the truck. Tom, Greg, and myself rode in front, Erin and Bea rode in the backseat, and the Hoffs rode on the bench seat we'd installed in the bed of the truck back in Highschool. We'd removed the back window so we could talk, seeing as we had the camper shell anyway, and installed some seatbelts, and some other shit so it was road legal.



All in all, it was a pretty great start to the trip. The Hoffs started interacting with everyone else, and we all started talking about whatever nonsense came to mind. At one point, 500 Miles by The Proclaimers came on, and we all sang along as a group. It started to rain in the canyon about the time we were passing an old Cemetery, and I had to slow down quite a bit, but the trip remained fun. We stopped at the summit of the canyon, grabbed some drinks, pissed, and kept on. Eventually, we made it to Green River, got some food at a local  restaurant, grabbed some last minute supplies, and went to the canyon. It wasn't raining anymore by the time we reached the small town, and by the time we got to the canyon, the skies were pretty much clear. It took about an hour and a half to get to the spot I wanted to camp in once we were in the canyon, and once we got there, we piled out and started setting up.



"Wanna share a tent, Tom, Jason?" said Rick. He'd really been on one with the flirting the entire trip, and the magic of the joke was starting to wear off a bit.



"Rick, please. I really just wanna get set up so we can eat some food and get hammered." said Tom. I just kept working on unloading the truck. It took about an hour to set everything up, and as soon as we had the fire going, we started cooking.



"Aren't you worried about bears?" said Carrie. I laughed a bit, but she seemed genuinely concerned.



"Nah, they probably won't bug us, assuming there's any in the area to begin with. And we'll lock the coolers up in the truck bed before we go to sleep." I said. "Plus, we weren't gonna come all the way up here and not eat anything."



"Fair enough. I guess I just worry about stupid stuff sometimes." she said, eyes turned down.



"It's not stupid. Don't sweat that stuff dude. Let's just have a good time." I said, and everyone voiced their agreement. She smiled and looked back to the group, sitting around the fire with a great big Dutch oven full of potatoes, bacon, beans, and veggies, slow cooking to make what my family had always called "Mountain Taters".



"Would someone please pass me a beer?" she asked, smile fully back to normal Carrie levels. She was always smiling.



After we ate, we really started to party. We pulled out pipes and smoked weed while staring at the stars, we drank way too many beers, and definitely too much liquor. We sang, told stories that we'd all already heard a million times, joked, and enjoyed ourselves. I thought I was on top of the world. That all changed a few hours later.



I woke up to the incredibly loud sound of heavy rain on canvas. It was pouring, but luckily I had done a waterproofing treatment on my tent before we came out. I got out of my sleeping bag and unzipped the front tent flap, only to see running water on the ground, going down the slight slope towards the road. I saw flashlights come on and called out to the others.



"Where the fuck did this storm come from? I yelled. It was rhetorical, but Mike answered anyway.



"The fucking sky, I'd imagine!" the snark was enough to annoy me, but we had bigger issues to deal with. The wind was getting wild, and if not for the trees, we'd probably have been blown away.



"We're gonna have to get the fuck outta here! This is way too much man!" yelled Rick, who was standing in the middle of what was once our fire pit, wearing nothing but boxers and socks, long red hair matted to his chest.



"Why the fuck don't you have any clothes on?" I asked, now more interested in that than the storm around us.



"I like the way the water feels on my skin, but didn't wanna get nude!" he yelled back as though it was an obvious answer.



"Why the socks man?" I asked, starting to gather my things.



"Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to!" he replied. With that, I decided to ignore him and help everyone get their stuff torn down and into the truck. Rick was insane, but he was correct, we needed to book it. I didn't know how long this storm would last, or if it would get worse, and I didn't want to be around to find out.



After around thirty minutes, we had everything piled into the truck, including ourselves, and started to work our way back off of the mountain. With the adrenaline I'd felt being in such a massive storm, I hadn't had time to feel disappointed that our trip was getting cut short. Once I was in the relative safety of the truck, it really sank in. Our trip was over, and we might never have another one like this.



I pushed the sadness down so  could focus on driving, but  even then it was hard to pay attention. The wind was strong enough to make steering much harder, the mud we were driving through wouldn't stop me, but control was harder to maintain, and the rain on the windshield was so bad I almost couldn't see. I began thinking we should maybe stop and wait in the truck when Erin screamed.



"There's a fucking deer! Lookout!" It was ear piercing, but it got my attention on the buck standing in the road. I swerved hard to miss it, and embedded my truck in a muddy ditch.



"Fuck!" I yelled. "I guess we're stopping here, huh?"



"At least we're not dead. Is everyone okay?" said Carrie. I immediately felt bad for worrying more about my truck than the people in it.



"Fuck. Sorry guys. Is everyone alright?" I asked. Greg, Tom, Rick, Carrie, Mike, Mark, and Erin replied, but I heard nothing from Bea.



"Bea, you alright?" I asked again, twisting myself in my seat to look back. She was staring out of her window, face pale, and eyes as wide as any human eyes could go.



"Bea, baby, are you okay?" asked Erin. She placed her hand on Bea's shoulder.



"That wasn't a deer." Bea said softly "That wasn't a fucking deer. We've gotta get off of this fucking mountain, now."



"Calm down baby, it was a deer. I saw it first, remember? We're okay, and the truck isn't too bad either. We'll figure it out, okay?" said Erin, obviously worried about Bea, who was shaking her head and mumbling.



"Fuck, Jason, let's get the truck out of the mud and get moving. If it can't pop out on its own, we can push while you're backing up." said Greg.



"Alright yeah, we've gotta get back to town. Bea isn't doing great." I said, putting the truck in reverse and four-low. I pressed the gas pedal down slowly, building to full throttle, and the tires didn't grab, just shot rooster tails into the air as they spun.



"Fuck. We're gonna have to push." I said, looking at Greg. He nodded and called for Rick and Mark to help. The three of them were big guys, so I thought they would probably be able to get the job done.



"Don't go out there!" Bea screamed from the back. She was sobbing now "Don't you fucking dare!"



"Baby you need to ca-" Erin started to say, but Bea cut her off.



"It came up to my fucking window! I saw it! That thing wasn't a fucking deer! I don't know what the fuck it was, but if you get out, it's going to kill you!" she screamed, now in full blown hysterics. I was getting worried. Maybe she'd hit her head when we went into the ditch?



"Don't worry Bea, we'll be okay. I promise. We've gotta get the truck unstuck though. It'll only take a few minutes. I promise everything will be alright." said Mark, getting himself unbuckled and ready to brave the storm. Bea was still completely hysterical, but it didn't stop Rick, Greg, and Mark. They got out, and I waited for them to get in front and start pushing before I hit the gas. After a few minutes of pushing and revving, the tires finally caught something and went back. We were on the road again. I got straightened out and waited for Mark, Greg, and Rick to get back in. But they weren't coming into the lights. I thought maybe they'd slipped, so I grabbed my flashlight from the glovebox and got out to look for them. As soon as I was out of the truck, against Bea's continued pleading, I heard Greg and Rick yelling. I couldn't understand what they were saying over the sound of the truck's engine and the rain, so I made my way back over to the ditch, shining my light on the spot where the truck had been.



"Mark! Mark where the fuck did you go dude! We can't be playing this fucking game right now! We gotta go!" I heard from Rick as I approached.



"What the fuck happened?" I yelled over the downpour.



"Mark just fucking took off! We got the truck pushed back onto the road and he just fucking bolted!" Greg said. I felt my stomach hit my feet. What the fuck was he thinking? I told Greg and Rick that we should go get more light from the truck, and as we turned to walk back, I saw the truck drive straight into a tree.



"What the fuck?" I screamed and sprinted over. The screaming from inside the truck could be heard even with the doors closed. I got to the driver's side door and saw Mark sitting behind the wheel, dazed, but alive. I ripped the door open and grabbed him by the shirt.



"What the fuck are you doing? Jesus Christ Mark!" I screamed. I had a tight grip on his shirt, but he pulled away and looked at me with something crazy behind his eyes.



"We are nothing but the beginning. Those who follow are the real feast. Those who come looking. Those who seek to find us. To return our corpses to families. They'll find nothing but stains where there were once men. We ae doomed" he said. What the fuck was he even saying? He didn't talk like this. Did someone in the group give him bad acid or something? Did he take DMT? 

  
"Mark, buddy, what the fuck are you talking about? You're not making any sense man." I said, trying to calm him and maybe bring him back to the real world.

  
"We are fucking fodder!" he screamed back at me, shoving me back away and jumping out of the truck. He ran around the front of the truck to the tree, screaming "fodder, fodder" as he went. I got back up off of my ass to follow him, and stop him from running off into the storm, and as I rounded the tree, I saw him. I still hear that sound when it's quiet sometimes.

  
A horrible thudding and squelching noise, just audible above the pounding rain as he smashed his head into the tree. He was still trying to speak, but his jaw had come apart, and it was coming out as nothing but a wet, horrid gurgle. I screamed and rushed over to pull him away from the tree, but it was too late. He slumped into my arms as I got to him, and I screamed. Mike had made it from the truck, with Greg and Rick right behind him. 

  
"Mark!" I heard him scream. I heard part of him die in that scream. His little brother was gone, and some part of Mike's mind went with him. 

  
"Oh Jesus fucking Christ!" I heard from Greg before he joined Ricky in retching. Mike had made it over and taken Mark's disfigured corpse from my arms, screaming and crying. He was trying to put his jaw back together, and sobbed all the harder as chunks of his brother's head fell between his fingers.

  
"What the fuck happened?" I heard Greg shout. His voice was shaky, like he was trying to keep from crying. I just looked at him, unable to speak. My mind was blank. I had no idea how to explain that I'd seen him bashing his own fucking brains out, screaming about how we were about to be eaten. 

  
"We've gotta get Mike dude. He can't be doing this." Rick said, moving to pull Mike away from Mark. He got a hand on his shoulder and Mike lashed behind him. 

  
"Don't fucking touch me! Stay the fuck away from me!" he screamed and cradled his brother closer. At that point, Carrie had made her way out of the truck, and was screaming. Erin and Bea weren't far behind. Erin just dropped to the ground, but Bea stared down at Mark, unblinking even as the rain hit her eyes.

  
"I told you all to stay in the truck. I begged you, and you wouldn't listen. Why the fuck didn't you listen? I fucking told you what would happen!" She was getting louder with each sentence, before Greg cut her off.

  
"Is this really the time for a fucking 'I told you so' Bea? Maybe shut the fuck up and let us get Mike and Mark back in the truck before you start fucking lecturing us about this shit." Bea looked shocked out of her fear. Like the reality had come smashing into her so hard that the grief shoved any terror out of her body. 

  
"Get everyone back in the truck, Jason and I will handle Mark and Mike" Greg said to Rick. Rick nodded and started helping everyone back. Greg kneeled next to me and spoke softly.

  
"We can talk about what the fuck happened later, right now we need to get them out of this. We can put Mark in a sleeping bag for now maybe. But we can't just leave him in the rain, right?" I nodded "Good. Let's just get that far." I don't know how he was so calm. He'd always been a level headed guy, but this was next level. He'd gone to the back of the truck and gotten a sleeping bag out by the time I had gotten back to my feet. We got around Mike and put our hands on his arms. He tried to fight and thrashed a bit, but we managed to get him off. Rick had come back, and we had him take Mike to the truck. 

  
"Alright Jason, let's get him into the bag, we can put him in the truck, under the other stuff so Mike isn't having to stare at him all night. The engine is still running, so we should be able to get off of the mountain tonight." Greg said, unzipping the bag and working Mark's feet into it. I grabbed his shoulders and helped lift him into a manageable spot. Looking down into his ruined face, I wanted to throw up, but managed to hold it in. We got the sleeping bag zipped up around our friend, and carried him to the back of the truck. We placed him underneath the rest of the gear, and got back into the front seat.

  
"What's the plan guys?" Rick asked as we got in. Mike was still sobbing into Carrie's chest, Erin was crying into her hands, and Bea was staring blankly into the floor. Rick, for his part, was keeping it together, but we could see that his eyes were red and puffy. We'd all just seen Mark dead, and in the worst fucking way imaginable. No one was okay, but Greg was holding it together the best. I still hadn't spoken a word, but I could feel that my mouth was open, just a bit. 

  
"We're getting off of this fucking mountain, for one." said Greg. "And then we're gonna get some help." My mind was starting to swim as the catatonic state was wearing off. Mark was dead, and I'd watched him do it. Oh my god, I'd watched one of my oldest friends bash his fucking head into pieces on a fucking tree. Why did I want this trip? Why did I drag everyone out into this fresh Hell?

  
"Jason, buddy, look at me. You gotta take deep breaths. We can't freak out yet. We have to get down the mountain, and then we can fall apart. But we need to get to town first." Greg said. I was hyperventilating and hadn't noticed until he said something. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't get a handle on it. I felt my head getting light. Greg and Rick were both talking to me, but it was like I was underwater, and I couldn't tell what they were saying. My vision tunneled, and I fainted.
