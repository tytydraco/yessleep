Entomology is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of insects. Insects in general seem to be some of the most misunderstood animals in nature. This misunderstanding is largely due to the innate human fear of insects. Maybe, there is an evolutionary explanation for this. After all, many insects can deliver a nasty bite, or worse a deadly injection. However, these creatures tend to carry a delicate beauty to them as well. Butterflies come to mind when speaking of the beauty of an insect. 

I say all this, to create an understanding of what insects mean to me. As long as I can remember, I’ve always been fascinated with the creatures. Crafting intricate displays of taxidermied insects and arthropods. Along with intricate assortments of butterfly cases. While I myself found these displays of muted, vibrant colors to be breathtaking. Others tended not to agree with me. I found myself alone throughout my school years. This loneliness however, never steered me away from my obsession. It was only natural that I would continue this obsession into my college years. Where I myself would study to become an entomologist. 

I sat alone in my home, surrounded by my collections. I had recently been studying a species of beetle local to my area. It was a species of longhorn beetle that I had begun to pin on a board. The pinning was a delicate process. Especially considering the slender body of the insect. I inhaled, steadying myself to place the first pin. My hands steadied, slowly moving to begin, when my office phone rang. I jumped, and swore as the pin skewered the body of the beetle. Annoyed, I moved towards the phone and picked up the receiver.

“Is this Doctor Cordelia Roch?” The voice was warm, however it had a slight hint of hesitation behind it. 

“It is.” I replied, shifting to a more comfortable position leaning against my desk. “Who am I speaking to?” The person on the other end cleared their throat. 

“This is Declan Scarberry, with Oregon State Parks. I’m head ranger at Silver Falls.” The hesitation had seemed to dissipate slightly. “I was recommended to reach out to you. We seem to have some sort of bug problem out here. It’s best if I explain in person.” I stayed silent, as I held the receiver. Declan cleared his throat awkwardly on the other end. “Doctor Roch, are you still there?” 

“Yes I’m still here.” I shifted from my position leaning against the desk. “Shouldn’t you be able to handle a bug problem? I’m an entomologist not an exterminator.” The hesitation slowly began to creep back in Declan’s voice. However, he rushed his reply.

“Again it’s better if I explain in person. Would you be able to come down to Silver Falls by this afternoon?” I could hear Declan swallow on the other end. He was nervous. I inhaled sharply, it’s not like I had much to do today anyway. 

“I’ll be there in about 40 minutes.” Without letting Declan reply, I put the receiver down. It connected to the base with a click. 

I stepped out of my car, into the misty Oregon air. It was raining slightly, and I could hear the small plaps as rain droplets hit my jacket. The trees towered around me, creating a faux wall. There was a small wooden building. A sign stood nearby that read Park Office. A stout man ran out of the office. He had wrapped himself in a gray poncho. He waved, and approached closer. His salt and pepper beard parted to reveal a warm smile. 

“You must be Doctor Roch.” The man said enthusiastically, he held out his hand. “Declan.” I took his hand and shook it. 

“You can just call me Cordelia.” Declan nodded, and rubbed the back of his head awkwardly. 

“Sorry about that. Here follow me, I bet you don’t want to dilly dally.” Declan motioned for me to follow him. I followed behind the man, my shoes being pulled slightly by the mud from the rain. Declan seemed to handle the now muddy terrain easier. He led me to a tree line off of the trail. The trees provided some shelter from the rain, as Declan approached one of the trees. He pointed at a dry looking patch of bark. He peeled off the dead bark, showing small tunnel-like structures.

“Western Pine Beetles?” I asked, raising an eyebrow. Declan nodded, and shifted back to face me.

“We’ve been having problems with them out here.” His eyes shifted nervously, and he smiled awkwardly.

“You asked me out here just to confirm a common invasive species?” Declan held his hands up defensively. 

“They’ve been a nuisance around here for a while.” I glared back at Declan.

“They’ve been a nuisance everywhere.” I turned to leave, as I trudged back towards my car. The rain began to come down harder. I heard Declan follow behind me. I ignored him, as I drew closer to my car. Before he could say anything, I heard a crackle. The radio at his hip had come to life.

“Declan, you there?” A feminine voice asked, the radio beeped as it went silent. I turned to face Declan, as he unclipped the radio from his waste.

“I’m here.” He replied as he spoke into the radio. His shoulders relaxed as he answered the woman. 

“There’s a problem at the North Falls Group Camp.” The woman replied, and Declan’s face went pale. He glanced at me, and hit the button on the side of the radio to reply.

“I’ll be there soon.” He hooked the radio back onto his waist. Declan inhaled, and closed his eyes. He turned to face me. “Cordelia, I think you’ll want to see this.” 

I didn’t know why, but I agreed to come with Declan to the campsite. We sat silently in Declan’s truck together. He was gripping onto the steering wheel. His knuckles turned a shade of white. He parked his truck in a small parking lot. The lot was empty. The only other inhabitants were four other cars. One of them was another ranger vehicle. Another was a minivan with a set of five white stick figure stickers plastered on the rear view window. Declan inhaled deeply, and left the driver's side. I followed him out into the rain. 

Looking at the campground, I felt a chill run across my spine. The area was empty. The only other person was a woman. She ran over to Declan and myself. Her curly black hair was covered by a gray poncho similar to Declan’s. She was taller than both of us, and slightly lanky. The woman held out her hand to me to introduce herself.

“Mary.” She said warmly, and she shook my hand. She smiled widely, and I returned her smile. Mary didn’t seem as awkward as Declan. 

“Doctor Cordelia Roch, you can call me Cordelia.” I added hastily, she nodded and turned her attention to Declan. 

“I got a call that hikers from the Twin Falls trail heard something down here.” Mary’s smile faltered as she said this. Declan nodded understandingly as he left my side. The two rangers walked off towards a man made canopy. I stayed behind, letting my eyes wander across the site. I immediately noticed a small area, with picnic tables. I approached the tables to take a seat, as the two rangers continued their conversation. I sat on the rotting wooden bench of the picnic table. The table had been graffitied with the names of long gone park goers. However, as I stated at the table, something caught my eye. A small dried stain, that was blackish in color. I stared at the stain, and felt a lump in my throat as I realized what I was looking at. It was dried blood. 

I immediately stood from the picnic table, not knowing why I was so uncomfortable by a stain of blood. Most likely someone had accidentally cut themselves while eating. Nonetheless I moved away from the table, making my way towards another. I focused on the tree line to catch my breath. The leaves bounced under the weight of the rain. The drizzle had become a more consistent downpour. The droplets that landed on my coat had become more frequent. As I stared at the tree line I noticed something. A small silhouette stood, amongst the thicket. I stared at the thing, and my brain soon realized what I was staring at. It was a child. A small boy with dirty blonde hair stood staring back at me.

I couldn’t make out his facial features well, however he seemed to be expressionless. Just staring back at me. I walked towards the boy, and spoke out.

“Are you ok?” I asked. A million questions running through my mind. The boy didn’t reply. Instead he stood motionless staring back at me. “Where are your parents?” I asked as I grew closer. I could now begin to make out his features. The boy had brown eyes, and his skin seemed almost sallow. Like all natural color had been taken from him. He continued to stare at me. My shoes had continued to be sucked in by the mud. It was making it harder for me to approach the boy. Suddenly I froze. I noticed that the boy’s eyes seemed dull. Like some integral part that made him human was missing. Then I noticed the most alarming detail of all. The boy wasn’t breathing. I turned to call out to Declan and Mary. Before the words could escape my lips, something snapped from within the foliage. I turned just in time, to see the boy pulled back into the tree line. He didn’t move, instead he seemed to almost fly backwards. His limbs dangled limply, like a marionette that had its strings cut. 

I hadn’t had much of a chance to tell Mary and Declan about what I saw. I had frantically said something about a boy in the trees. Mary had taken this as a sign to round up a group of rangers, and take them in the direction I had seen the boy. Declan was driving me back to my car, not elaborating on what he and Mary had been discussing. In all manners of the term, I was left in the dark. All I knew was that everyone from that campsite had disappeared. As Declan drove, the sun began to set. The rain was coming down harder now. The droplets let out audible thuds against the hood of his truck. The ranger adjusted his rear view mirror, and cleared his throat. 

“It might not be safe for you to drive home in this weather.” He commented, as we approached the bend in the road that led to the Park Office. “We have cabins in the park. I’m sure we could find you an empty one for the night.” I thanked him for his generosity, and leaned my head against the truck’s window. I watched as we sped past trees. The rain, and encroaching darkness creating a distorted view of the forest. 

“Declan are you there?” The radio of Declan’s truck crackled to life with the sound of Mary’s voice. I jumped out of my trance, catching my breath. Declan grabbed a small hand held receiver, and parked his truck.

“I’m here.” He replied, a hint of exhaustion creeping into his voice. 

“I think I found the kid. I can see someone standing in the tree line. I’ve been trying to radio the others, but I’m not getting anything.” Mary replied, worry seeped into each word she said. Declan started the truck, and turned it around.

“Where are you? I’m on my way.”

“I’m close to the perimeter trail waterfall. You should be able to see my flashlight from the road.” With that, Declan put down his receiver. He had begun to speed, to make it in time to help Mary. As I opened my mouth to tell him about what had happened with the child earlier, I paused. A look of concern had painted itself across his face. His eyes focused on the road ahead. 

Declan skidded his truck into the mud on the side of the road. He jumped out of the truck, running to the back. I followed, holding my arm over my head to try and shield myself from the rain. Declan grabbed an industrial flashlight. He tossed it to me, and grabbed another for himself.

“I know search and rescue isn’t in your job description. But spread out, we need to find Mary.” Before I could reply, Declan walked off into the woods. He seemed to speed up, as he approached the tree line. I walked in the other direction, searching for the beam of Mary’s flashlight. I scanned the dense woods, lighting the path ahead of me. I stepped gingerly through the brush, fighting against a combination of mud and hidden obstacles. I continued walking, my eyes scanning the darkness ahead of me. Until, like the dim glow of a projector I saw it. The beam of a flashlight. I approached finding the device on the ground. I paused, scanning the tree line with my flashlight.

“Mary?” I called out to the darkness, hoping to see some sign of the ranger. Almost like an act of god, my beam of light illuminated a set of muddy footprints. Instead of continuing into the woods like one would expect, the trail stopped. The final set of prints were located near one of the taller trees around me. I panned my flashlight up the tree. Slowly illuminating each part of the bark, as the beam of light trailed up. My beam caught a pair of boots dangling from up high. Then a pair of legs, and a torso. Mary was floating above me, her eyes seemed dull. I could tell however, that she was still alive due to the labored movement of her chest. Then I noticed what was keeping Mary afloat. Originally I had thought it was a branch, however as my light hit the object it moved. 

Several things that I thought originally were branches, began retracting back into the darkness. Mary’s body jolted and she began to fall to the ground. As the ranger fell, I glimpsed a brownish black circular object retreating from her back. The cylinder seemed to have some sort of sharp spike like object at the end. It retracted into the cylinder, and with that the thing disappeared quickly into the dark. I rushed over to Mary, who was now laying limply on the ground. She was still breathing, however there was a quarter sized hole in her back. 

I’m writing this from one of the cabins near the Park Office. I took Declan’s offer on staying at one of the empty cabins, due to the weather. Declan eventually found Mary and I, and drove her back to the office. Instead of taking her to the hospital, the ranger’s insisted on treating her on site. They said it would be safer, and more likely she would survive. I don’t believe them. I don’t believe I was asked to come here, just to examine some Western Pine Beetles.
