If you’re reading this, odds are that I’m already gone, and you’re experiencing the same thing I was. All I have is one piece of advice for you, do NOT open the door. It sounds cliche, but once you hear my story, you’ll understand.

It started with me heading to the bar with some friends. We were all having a good time, drinking and hollering at every pretty woman we saw. Eventually, we got too rowdy, and they kicked us out, leaving us to stumble our way home. 

I had to get home soon anyway, my cat doesn’t feed himself after all. I still had a takeaway cup from the bar, which I was taking sips from. Looking back on it now, not getting a lid for it was the the dumbest fucking thing I ever did.

I was stumbling back home, when all of a sudden, I saw a figure at the end of the street. They were standing just outside of a street light so that I could not make out their appearance. My eyes struggled to focus on the mysterious figure. Suddenly, they walked into the light, revealing…

A well dressed man. He wore a plain brown suit and tie, brown dress pants, and black dress shoes. Finally being able to see him, I relaxed and continued to press on home. I noticed how the man also began to walk so that we were heading towards each other. 

The *clop clop clop* of his shoes against the pavement was almost deafening, even from this distance. Each one of his footfalls made my head pound, making me stumble more and more. When we were within mere feet of each other, each step sent my world into chaos and misery. 

As we passed, I finally lost my footing, and fell directly into him, my whiskey spilling all over his fine clothes. I hit the ground, hard. I stared up at the dark sky, watching the stars twinkle like diamonds up above. Then, another view came into my vision.

The man was staring down at me, a fiery glow in his eyes and a look of pure malice on his face. As his eyes met mine, an icy chill coursed through my body. I could feel something awful emanating from him as his eyes stared deeper into mine, this man seemingly cursing me with all his might. Then I blinked.

I was in my bed. The sun was shining through my window and my clock read 9:30 am.  I wiped the sleep from my eyes and looked around confused. My cat, Beef, sat at the foot of my bed, grumpy that he had not been fed yet. But all I could think about was the man I had seen last night. I could still see, no, *feel* his eyes staring into mine. That chill that I had felt still resonated within me, and that awful energy radiating off of him seemed to linger in the air. 

Nevertheless, I had chores to do and a cat to feed. I got up and walked to the kitchen, opened the cabinet and poured some food into Beef’s bowl. That’s when I heard it.

A tap on the window behind me, just loud enough to be heard. I wheeled around, startling Beef. I expected to see the man there, still staring at me. But there was nothing.

That was just the beginning.

Over the next few weeks, small things began to happen, be it a tap on the window or a knock at my door. Eventually, just when I began to question my own sanity, the voices began, always speaking from behind a door I was near to. Whenever I went to open the door, some primal sense in me told me not to, so I had to resist the temptation.

At first, they were speaking in unintelligible gibberish. But with each passing encounter, their words and voices began to form. They had the voices of everyone I loved. My parents, my grandparents, my brothers, my sister, my aunts and uncles, and so many more. They tormented me for weeks, screaming, begging, pleading for me to just open that damned door, to let them in.

They all had a different reason for me to let me in. *“I’m hurt!”* My mother screamed. *“There’s someone chasing me!”* My brother yelled in desperation. *“The house is on fire!”* cried my father. *“It’s so cold out.”* My sister hauntingly stated.

Then one day, a new voice joined the symphony of horror. It was, my own voice. It joined in with the others, now demanding that I open the door, ordering me to just let. Them. In.

As I write this now, I can’t take it anymore. They’re at my bedroom door. I’m going to open it. I need to end this misery.
