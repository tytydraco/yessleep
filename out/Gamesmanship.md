I cheat.

I cheat a lot. I wouldn't go so far as to say *compulsive*, but it's not far off. Not on people, not via AI— I have *some* moral boundaries— but on pretty much everything else. Taking a test? You best bet I'll need to "run to the bathroom" at least a few times to check my notes. One attempt left on the Wordle? I'm looking up that word; I'll be damned if I break my streak.

Games, in truth, are the worst victim of my cheating. It's been this way as long as I can remember; I was the kid who insisted on being the bank teller in Monopoly, who glanced over at my opponent's cards during Uno or Go Fish, etcetera etcetera.

Point is, I'm a big fat cheat. Always have been. Or at least, I used to be. My years of cheating are behind me, and I can now say without a shadow of a doubt: I will *never* cheat again.

You're probably wondering why I'm admitting to all this, and in order to explain that, I need to start at the beginning. The beginning which, ironically, was at the end of a pretty great night.

It was Carmen's birthday party. I wasn't Carmen's friend, per se, but she was pretty tight with a couple of my roommates and since our shared townhouse was the designated 'party house', it was only logical that her birthday celebration be hosted here. A bunch of mutual friends came and we had a grand ol' time— there was music, dancing, drinking... *so* much drinking. It really was a lovely night; a little chilly for a Friday in May, but in a pleasant way that had people mingling in our backyard with their cigarettes and joints instead of loitering by a cracked window.

But, like all good things, it had to come to an end, and as the clock neared one in the morning, a steady stream of guests trickled out into the night, leaving just me, my roommates Trev and Prakash, Lila, Sophie, and of course Carmen. Our fourth roommate, Andre, had fucked off to his bedroom some hours ago, leaving our little sextet lounging around on what was formerly the dance floor (in reality, it was usually where we kept the university townhouse equivalent of a dining room table, which had been temporarily relocated to my room.)

Lila and Sophie were Carmen's friends that I hadn't met before, but from the scant conversations we had had as I poured my best approximation of a shot into solo cups for them, they seemed nice enough. So when Sophie, after she had finished her latest bout of giggles, suddenly lit up with an exaggerated gasp and said, "Do you guys wanna play a board game?", I didn't think it was the worst idea in the world.

"It's kind of late," Trev said, glancing at Prakash and I in the hopes that we would back him up, "Maybe another time?"

"Well, *I'm* down," Prakash flashed Trev a grin, who groaned under his breath, "Landon?"

I shrugged, raising my hands in surrender. "Why not?"

"Guess you've been outvoted," Lila shot Trev a coy smile, reaching over to pat him on the back. She had been finding excuses to be close to him all evening, from sitting on the edge of the couch next to him to now taking the seat beside him. I rolled my eyes and made a mental note to tell him later that she was *obviously* hitting on him— Trev was always kind of oblivious when it came to the ladies.

"I'd really rather just go to bed," Trev said apologetically, moving to stand.

"Wait, no, this game needs at least six people! It'll be fun, Trevor, I promise!" Sophie, who had just re-emerged from a cabinet under the stairs I didn't even know we had, cut in.

"Wait, what are we even playing?" Prakash asked, squinting at the box in her hand.

Sophie took her seat, looked around at all of us, and then plopped down a thick two-piece game box on the table. On the cover, under a thick layer of dust, I could make out the word *Veritas* and the tagline "The Truth Will Set You Free!" written under it in old-timey lettering.

"Holy shit, whose is this?" Prakash turned to me and Trev, who looked equally confused. We both shook our heads, then eventually turned back to Sophie, who was smiling nervously.

"Did you bring your own game to this party?" Trev asked slowly, leaning back in his chair a bit.

"Dude, that's... weird." Carmen, who I had almost forgot was there despite it being *her* birthday, finally piped up, shooting a clearly embarrassed Sophie a strange look.

"No, listen," Sophie put her hands up, "Guys, it's not like that, okay! It's just, look. My dad was a huge board game fanatic, he- he used to collect them. I was looking for a place to put my bag, opened up that closet-thing"—she gestured to that strange, wall-inset cabinet—"and found this game. I remembered him talking about playing it in college, and I thought it'd be fun. That's all. But, like, Carmen, it's your night. I shouldn't have made it about me, I'm sorry. We don't have to play."

Carmen smiled sadly and pulled Sophie into a half-hug. "Oh, no, Soph, *I'm* sorry. I shouldn't have assumed, and you're not making anything about you. No, we can play."

"I guess it's Andre's, then?" Prakash wondered aloud before I kicked him under the table, gesturing to Carmen and Sophie's heartfelt moment. He rolled his eyes, but shut up all the same.

"You sure?" Sophie asked tentatively.

"Yeah, I want to!" Carmen said enthusiastically, and we all followed suit, nodding and agreeing. Sophie, seemingly reassured, explained what she knew about the game to us. It was a party game, apparently, sort of like a Truth or Dare or Never Have I Ever, used to break the ice and get to know your friends a bit better. Sophie warned us that since the game had been out since at least the eighties, some of the questions would probably be a bit dated, but we figured we would get a good laugh out of it anyway.

As it turned out, the game functioned a lot like my old friend, Monopoly. There was a board, tokens, you would roll dice to move, but instead of money, you would pull cards with increasingly provocative questions, and you had to answer them to actually move your token.

Before we started playing, we all decided to get more drinks, and I'll admit that I spent the vast majority of that time trying to figure out how I could cheat. Even in the moment I was embarrassed, but I've always had a competitive streak. The obvious solution was just to answer every question or, if you don't want to answer, lie, but I even considered trying out some of those trick dice rolls I'd seen on YouTube to get double sixes.

I decided on that strategy as we all sat down and picked our tokens. I chose an apple, Prakash a strawberry, Trev a pomegranate, Sophie a pineapple, Lila a mango, and finally Carmen chose a raspberry.

"Hey, Sophie, why are all the tokens fruits?" Lila asked, thumbing over her miniature mango.

"Uh... I don't know, actually. But there were fruits on the cover, so, maybe just a thematic tie-in?" Sophie mused, then shrugged. "Honestly, no idea. But, are we ready? Should we start?"

"Yes!" Carmen cheered, "I'm going first, birthday girl and everything."

"It's not even your birthday anymore!" Prakash protested jokingly, all of us chuckling as she stuck her tongue out and rolled the dice anyway. She picked up the corresponding card and read it aloud.

"*How many people have you gone all the way with*— wait, what?" Carmen looked at Sophie, smiling incredulously, "*What* is this game, Soph?"

"I don't know!" Sophie said, dissolving in a fit of laughter. The rest of us were barely holding it together, and Sophie's laughing set the rest of us off. We all felt like a bunch of high schoolers again, even though we were fast approaching college graduation. It was fun to just fuck around and ask salacious questions, at least at first.

"Holy shit, Sophie, your dad was a freak!" Lila burst out, and we all started laughing again.

Eventually, we all settled down, and the attention turned back to Carmen. She chuckled, shaking her head. "Well, fuck it, right? It's my birthday. None of you assholes better judge me, okay?"

"Just say it!" Prakash chimed in, and Carmen elbowed him in the ribs playfully.

"*Fine,* goddamn!" Carmen relented, still laughing, "Eleven! Eleven, okay?"

She moved her token, and it shifted over to Sophie, then Lila, then Trev. Sophie and Lila got similar questions, which they answered following our teasing encouragement. Trev, though, seemed increasingly nervous, but he still pulled his card.

"*Who do you find most attractive in this room*?"

We all oohed and aahed, Lila remaining conspicuously silent and wearing a nervous smile. Trev, too, looked nervous. He glanced around like he was actually considering the question; in fairness, all three girls were pretty and single, but there was only one obvious answer: the girl who had been interested in him *all* night.

"Well, go on!" I urged after a moment of silence.

Trev glanced at me and nodded. "Lila."

More juvenile oohing started up, but it was quickly drowned out by a piercing scream. Trev's scream.

I turned toward him, but my question of "What is it?" died in my throat.

Trev, still screaming, was holding up the hand that had pulled the card. Or rather, what remained of it. In place of his right hand was a bloody, spurting nub. It wasn't a clean cut— it looked like someone had ripped it off manually.

Commotion erupted. It was all a blur. Everyone was screaming frantically, trying to get up and help, reaching for their phones. But strangely, it seemed like nobody was really doing anything. Everyone stayed seated, no help was called for, and Trev kept on howling, tears streaming down his face.

Then, we heard it. It cut through the din like a knife. It wasn't like a stereotypical demonic voice, deep and garbled. Instead, it sounded strangely angelic and orchestral, like a chorus was serenading us with a single word:

**Liar.**

"Who the fuck is that?!" Prakash yelled, trying and failing to stand, "Why can't I get up? What the hell is going on?"

**The game is not yet complete.**

We all exchanged glances. I can't describe what it's like to look around a room and simultaneously know that everyone there is just as terrified as you are, but none of you can do anything about it. My heart was in my throat.

"Why did that happen to Trev?" Lila burst out, through tears. Beside her, Trev was finally tapering off into quiet whines, grasping at what was once his hand. There was so much blood.

**The truth will set you free, and Trevor lied. He has been punished accordingly.**

I turned to Trev, who was breathing heavily. He looked like he was about to pass out. I felt like I might, too.

"Answer," Sophie spoke up, "Answer the question, Trev. Tell the truth, please. It's what *it*\- whatever- wants, please."

Trev inhaled shakily, then glanced over at me. "...Landon. I- I'm sorry."

We were all silent for a moment, save for Trev's shuddering sobs. It was a lot to process, and to be honest, I don't think I really have fully processed it, even now. At the time, I just heaved a sigh and put a hand on Trev's shaking shoulder.

"Okay, man. It's okay," I tried to rationalize, tried to keep myself together, "We have to keep playing. It wants us to keep playing so, we- we have to."

Trev nodded slowly, reaching up with the hand he did have to move his token accordingly. He looked at me, face dripping with tears and snot.

I smiled at him, "There you g-"

It was so fast. One second, I was looking at Trev's face, and the next, the inside of his head was splattered all over me. I gasped, choking and spitting out bits of brain matter and blood. I threw up beside the chair. I think Carmen did too. Lila, who was similarly speckled with Trev, had dissolved into wails, Sophie sat stock-still, eyes wide.

"Why?!" Prakash screamed, shaking his chair as he tried unsuccessfully to get up. It was as if we were superglued to the seats, able to jostle around a bit but not get anywhere successfully.

**Trevor cheated.**

"He answered your damn question," Carmen spat, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, "What more do you want?!"

**Cheating is another form of lying.**

"He didn't fucking-" Carmen hung her head down.

**The truth will set you free, and Trevor lied. He has been punished accordingly.**

The room fell silent as we awaited an explanation that never came, at least not from whatever was 'punishing' us.

It came from Sophie, who inhaled shakily and then said, softly, "You only get one chance to answer."

"What the fuck are you talking about, Soph?"

"It was in the rules... Trevor didn't- the first time, he- he lied," Sophie continued, unable to look at Lila, "And then, even though he told the truth, he had already used his turn, and- and-"

"And he moved his piece anyway," I finished for her. We all went quiet again. I can't speak for the others, for what was going through their minds, but for me, it was beginning to sink in that I was probably going to die at that table. It's a sobering feeling, both in the literal and metaphysical sense.

I was staring dazedly at the pattern of blood spatter adorning the table when I became acutely aware that everyone was looking at me. I looked up, confused.

"What?"

"Landon..." Carmen said, extending a hand with two once-white red dice towards me, "It's your turn."
