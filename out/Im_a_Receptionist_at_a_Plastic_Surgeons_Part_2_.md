The next time I came into work after the situation with Dr. Harrison and Kara, I thought about whether I should accept the pay raise and continue working at the office. I unlocked the front door and entered the waiting room, still working things out in my mind when I slammed right into a person. I sputtered backward and looked up in confusion and horror since I was supposed to be the only one allowed in this early at the clinic. 



“You must be, Maggie!” a cheery voice told me as he moved past me and turned off the alarm before it began blaring. I clutched my heart at the shock this stranger had just given me. The fact that he knew me but I didn’t know who he was made it worse. 



“W-who are you?” I blurted out after my heart nearly split my sternum and lept out of my chest. He flicked on the lights and the waiting room was fully lit up, revealing the person who had startled me so badly. To my surprise he seemed normal. I know that’s weird to say, but he seemed just so average. Average height, build everything. His hair was combed nicely and he had a big smile on his face. 



“I’m Wilson! Your new security guard.” He waved at me happily. I let my jaw drop a little at that. Not to throw shade at Wilson, because he’s such an absolute sweetheart, but he does not strike me as any kind of security guard. The only thing he had on that showed him to be a security guard was the vest that said security on it that he wears. I was also shocked that he had been hired so quickly! It had taken less than two days for Dr. Harrison to hire him. 



“H-how long have you been here?” I asked him, as I started to calm down and walked over to my reception desk. I was always the first one here and I usually arrived pretty early in the morning, so to be beaten here was an absolute shock to me. 



“Oh, I just arrived a couple of minutes ago actually! Sorry for locking the door, I had orders from Dr. Harrison to lock it after I entered,” he told me as he followed me over to my desk. That made sense to me. If he was going to be our security it made sense for him to arrive first now. As I started getting my things ready, I watched as Wilson took his post by the front door. He stood so still I swore he would make a perfect King’s guard. 



I slowly got to work on some paperwork as I waited for the hours to tick down to when Dr. Harrison and Rachael would arrive. Rachael was the first of the duo to arrive, rushing past the line of people who were already queuing for their appointments. She mumbled to herself as she dusted herself off and looked over at Wilson without even getting a slight startle from him. 



“Hey fatty,” she called out to me as she walked up to my desk. I didn’t even bat an eye at her as I flipped through the final few sheets of paperwork that I had. When she noticed that I wasn’t paying any attention to her, she walked up to me and slapped her hands down on the desk to get my attention. 



“Oh Rachel, I didn’t hear you come in,” I told her with a smile. The pissed-off look on her face was the most rewarding sensation I can get. “How can I help you, sweetie?” I asked her with a smile, sliding a bowl of candy close to her to tempt her. She looked at it with disgust and at me with even more. 



“Keep an eye on Wilson. If he starts doing anything weird, hand him off to Dr. Harrison. Understand? Get that through your thick twinky filled skull?” She tapped my forehead for emphasis. I swatted her hand away and nodded at her. I chanced a peep over at Wilson and noticed that he was looking at the two of us. I smiled and waved at him and he did the same. 



“I’ll be sure to keep you informed, Rachael. Oh by the way, when did you want me to schedule that operation for you?” I asked her, pulling some papers from underneath my desk. She looked at me with confusion.



“What operation?” She asked, to which I smiled devilishly. 



“The one to get that stick out of your ass,” I said with a little giggle. She tsked in anger and stormed off to get ready for the day's surgery. Leaving me to giggle and continue with my paperwork. About half an hour later, Dr. Harrison arrived also being hounded by the waiting patients. He sighed and looked over at Wilson with a smile and tussled his hair like an approving father.



“Hello, Dr. Harrison.” I waved at him as he approached. He flashed me a perfect toothy grin and came up to the desk. “You’ve got another busy day ahead of you, huh?” I asked him as I handed him a stack of papers and clipboards. He took one look at them and sighed as he took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes. 



“It’s never-ending,” he said with a sigh as he accepted the giant stack of forms and clipboards from me. He glanced over towards Wilson and then back at me. “Rachael told you to keep an eye on him, correct?” he asked me as he struggled with his mountain of paperwork. 



“Mhm,” I told him, just adding to the pile like a giant Jenga tower. “I’ll be sure to inform you, sir,” I told him as I finally finished giving him everything. He sighed and looked back over at Wilson. 



“Wilson, help me carry this shit.” He ordered the security guard. He nodded quickly and walked over, taking half the stack of papers from him and helping him carry them to the back operating rooms and consultation rooms. After Wilson returned I nodded at him and he opened the floodgates to allow everyone in. I braced myself for a long day as I started listening to what the patients wanted and what they needed. 



“What do you mean in six months?! I need this surgery now! Can’t you fucking see that you fucking cow?!” A woman screamed at me, tapping her manicured fingers on her clipboard for emphasis. I watched her and waited for her to finish so I could explain it to her. 



“Ma’am, Dr. Harrison is completely booked for the next six months. Now if someone cancels, there may be an opening, but for the foreseeable future I can only get you an appointment in six months.” I told her again, but she just completely refused to listen to me. 



“Get rid of someone’s appointment then! How is it that these ugly fuckers can get ahead of me?!” She screamed at me, getting some spit on my face. 



“Because they made an appointment before you, ma’am,” I told her, struggling to keep my composure. “Once again, I can schedule you for a visit in six months. Or you can wait and have it take even longer.” I pulled out the application for her and when I looked back at her, she was lunging at me to strangle me. She grabbed me by the throat and was about to start squeezing when she was suddenly yanked away from me. 



I coughed in surprise and looked over to see that Wilson had grabbed the lady and was effortlessly dragging her away and toward the entrance. She was screaming and kicking and throwing every kind of obscenity my way. Wilson leaned down and grabbed her by the hair and by her clothes and tossed her out like they do in cartoons. I was stunned at how strong he was, and what he had done to that woman, seemed to calm the other patients down as they came back up to me to continue with their paperwork and questions. 



At around noon I leaned back and gave myself a good stretch that popped a few joints and fixed my back. It was almost my lunch time and I looked over to see how much longer it would be. As I did I heard something skitter away and the lost and found box tipped over. I rolled my chair over towards it in complete confusion and saw that a few more items were missing. 



“What the hell?” I wondered aloud, before picking and placing things back into the box. I rolled back over to my desk and decided to keep more of an eye on the box. When I turned back out to look at the lobby I was shocked to see Wilson staring silently at me. 



“Is something wrong?” he asked me after I had jumped a foot out of my chair in surprise at seeing him standing there. 



“No, no, everything is okay, thank you Wilson. And thank you for dealing with that woman.” He smiled at me and nodded before going back over to his post. At this point, most of the patients had been dealt with and I was doing some more paperwork. Mostly just filling in a few items and signing off on some things. 



“Hey, Maggie, it’s your lunchtime,” Dr. Harrison said as he stuck his head into my reception area.” I looked over at him and smiled in excitement. Standing up from my chair and stretching some more again. 



“Can I get you anything while I’m gone, sir?” I asked him. He looked over at the old antique phone mounted on the wall. Still waiting for it to ring but with no luck. He sighed and pulled down his surgical mask before shaking his head. 



“Just the usual coffee is fine. How is Wilson? Anything strange?” he asked me as he entered the reception area completely and pulled off his surgical gloves. I looked back over at our silent guardian. 



“Well, there was a woman who tried to choke me out, he grabbed her and tossed her out,” I told him, mimicking how Wilson had thrown the woman out of the waiting room. Dr. Harrison looked over at Wilson for a moment and then nodded. 



“Alright. Well, I’ll have him watch your desk while you’re out.” I nodded as I grabbed my purse and phone. “Oh, one more thing. Has Rachael been making fun of you?” he asked me, which got my attention and stopped me from finishing my packing up. Rachael had always made fun of me for my weight, but like I’ve said before I’ve always been comfortable with who I am, so I’ve never allowed her words to get to me. 



“Sometimes, but it’s nothing I can’t handle sir,” I said with a smile. He looked at me and slowly nodded his head. Those gorgeous green eyes glimmered in the light of my office. Anytime I look too long at them I feel almost lightheaded. So I pulled my eyes away and finished packing up. “I’ll be going now sir, I’ll be back with your coffee.” 



“Right, see you soon, Maggie,” he said, slipping back into the hallways behind my office. I walked out into the waiting room and walked up to Wilson. 



“I’m off to lunch!” I told him and he nodded with a smile as well. I exited the clinic and headed to a nearby sandwich shop to get a bite to eat. After I’d eaten my sandwich, I stopped at the coffee shop that me and Dr. Harrison both enjoy before making my way back to the clinic. I was walking through the parking lot when I saw a hoard of people running and screaming out of the clinic. 



At first, I was worried that a fire had broken out or something, so I quickly ran closer to get a sense of what was happening. The people were all screaming in absolute terror and this didn’t seem to be a scream of the fire, these were screams of complete terror. Against my better judgment, I rushed in past the scores of screaming people, doing my best to keep my two coffees above everyone’s heads. 



When I finally made it into the lobby I could see why everyone had been running and screaming for their lives. Limbs and chunks of flesh were thrown in every direction. Some people were crawling away with only a few limbs still attached and screaming their lungs out. 



I looked over towards my desk and saw that Wilson was standing behind it. But he looked much different. His body was melting, not just his face but he looked like a wax sculpture melting in the summer heat. He looked over at me and I watched in disgust as one of his eyes slowly began to melt out of its socket. 



“Oh fuck that,” I declared and quickly turned around to leave, that was before something grabbed me by the leg and stopped my from running, yanking me backward into the waiting room again. I looked down at the floor and saw one of the arms on the floor was still moving somehow. I stared at it in horror but before I could process it, the severed arm began pointing towards my office again. 



I looked over and saw that the Wilson blob was no longer looking at me. He seemed to be transfixed on something. I looked down at the arm again and groaned a little as I started stepping through the bloody mess that the waiting room had become. As carefully as I could I started walking towards the doors that separate the waiting room from the ORs and the consultation rooms. 



I carefully opened the door and entered the hallways and was surprised to see both Dr. Harrison and Rachel standing nearby, Dr. Harrison’s gaze trained fully on the Wilson blob, and Rachael motioning for me to enter the closest consultation room with her. I quickly ran over and once I was in, Dr. Harrison followed after me and slammed the door behind him. 



“Way to go fatass, you were supposed to warn Dr. Harrison if that idiot started acting weird!” Rachael hissed at me, I could tell she wanted to smack the shit out of me, but with Dr. Harrison here she couldn’t. 



“He was fine when I left! What the hell is going on here?!” I demanded to know, suddenly realizing that I still had the coffees that Dr. Harrions and I were going to drink. 



“Quit both of you!” Dr. Harrison screamed. Rubbing his eyes and walking past the two of us and looking at himself in the mirror. He sighed and pulled out a bottle of eyedrops and began to squeeze a few drops into his eyes. “This is my fault. I got too focused on the surgery that I let my hold on Wilson slip.” He sighed, rubbing his eyes and blinking rapidly once the drops had settled. 



“What do we do now, sir?” I asked him, still confused but in a life and death situation, you don’t have any time to contemplate shit. I carefully handed him his hot coffee and he looked at it and then up at me. Sighing before taking it from me and opening the lid to blow on it. 



“Well…we have liquid nitrogen in one of the ORs. One of the operations today was a mole removal so we have it prepped. Maybe we can freeze him partially.” He wondered aloud to himself, starting to sip at his coffee and wincing at how hot it was. 



“With all due respect, sir. I don’t think he’s quite melted enough to ensure a thorough freeze. Couldn’t we simply turn the heater on and melt him? Then freeze him afterward?” Rachael asked, which seemed like a good idea to me. 



“Rachael…I don’t think I need to tell you, why that’s a horrible fucking idea.” Dr. Harrison hissed as he stared at Rachael with absolute disdain in his eyes and face. Rachael seemed to realize her mistake and quickly shirked away from Dr. Harrison’s intense gaze. I didn’t understand why it was a horrible idea but I didn’t want to pry. 



The three of us stood there trying to think of a way to escape. I took a sip of my iced coffee before looking over at Dr. Harrison’s coffee, which was still scolding hot. I carefully set mine down and walked up to him and took it from him. 



“What? Suddenly liking hot coffee?” he asked, a bit confused. I smiled and shook my head at him. 



“Why not just throw this at Wilson?” I pointed at the coffee. Dr. Harrison looked at me and then slowly began to nod. He turned to Rachael and ordered her to follow me out into the hall while he went to get the tank of liquid nitrogen. 



We opened the door to the hallway and Rachael and I went out to look for Wilson. It was pretty easy to find him since he had left a gross wet trail right to him. He was in the lobby eating several body parts and was seemingly paying us no attention. 



“Okay, you distract him, I’ll throw it on him,” I told Rachael. She looked at me like I was crazy. 



“Just throw it at him, he’s already distracted, you idiot.” She hissed, which got me to pout at her. 



“You’re no fun.” I huffed, before starting to sneak over towards the Wilson blob. As he was eating I stepped up behind him and quickly tossed the scolding cup of coffee on him. His skin boiled and sizzled and he screamed out in pain. A decent portion of it had landed on his face and the already melting skin began to slosh off of him in great wet chunks. 



“Out of the way, Maggie!” Dr. Harrison shouted walking past me with a bucket in his hands. I quickly ran behind him and with a quick flick, he threw the whole bucket at Wilson. His body began to steam and hiss as the two clashing temperatures on him collided. The liquid nitrogen began to take effect and Wilson began to freeze in place, and in a few moments, he was frozen solid. 



“Thank God that’s over.” Rachael sighed, walking over to us. Dr. Harrison however didn’t look too happy about this. He looked terrified. I looked around the waiting room and stared at the gore that had happened, and before I could even think about what I was doing I leaned over and threw up on Rachael’s shoes. 



She said every swear in the book as she stepped away from me. I apologized half-heartedly and noticed that Dr. Harrison was gone. I looked around for him and noticed his trail in the Wilson goop and gore led back to the reception desk. I poked my head in and noticed that he was using that old phone. And that he looked like a wound-up ball of anxiety. He was tapping his foot and biting his nails as he was waiting for the phone to connect. 



“Hello, sir. Yes. Yes, I know. Yes, I’m aware Mr. Sinclair.” Dr. Harrison nodded over and over again. I had never seen him so submissive before. It was like he was being scolded by his father. “Well…something happened and I need your help to clean it up. Yes, quite a few actually. I’m sorry sir…I thought I could handle it.” He winced afterward. 



“You barf on my shoes and now you’re eavesdropping on our boss?” Rachael asked me, startling me and getting a yelp out of me. Dr. Harrison looked over at us and turned his back to us, starting to talk quieter so we couldn’t hear him. 



“You can go home, we’re gonna be closed for a while.” Rachael told me, before walking away down the hall towards the ORs. I watched her and sighed as I picked up the few items I had at my desk that weren’t covered in Wilson goop. 



“I appreciate that, sir. Thank you. I’ll make it up to you.” Dr. Harrison sighed and hung up the antique phone. Walking back into the hallway without telling me goodbye. The first time that’s ever happened. 



I wasn’t called back into work until the end of the week and when I entered the lobby I was shocked to see Wilson standing at his post with that same happy smile as before he turned into a melted version of himself. Not only that, but the waiting room was completely spotless and looked cleaner than it had ever been. 



“Morning Maggie! I’m so sorry about what happened last time, I promise it won’t happen again.” He told me, to which I could only nod and walk past him towards my desk. I gripped my can of pepper spray close until Dr. Harrison came into work. I quickly stood up and ran over toward him. 



“What’s he doing back?!” I asked, completely stunned that he had allowed Wilson back in any form or shape. 



“I had him fixed. He should work much better now.” Dr. Harrison sighed and I could tell he was still upset over what had happened. He looked at me with those beautiful green eyes and I saw for the first time since meeting him, pain and sadness behind them. “I'm so sorry this happened, Maggie. I wanted to make you feel safer and I fucked it up.” He sighed and rubbed his messy brown hair. 



“I-It’s alright sir! I still have…a lot of questions. But I’m just glad that you’re okay. And…if you say that Wilson is better now, I can accept him.” I looked over at Wilson and gave him an awkward smile and wave. He waved back. 



“I appreciate that, Maggie,” he said with a small smile. He patted me on the head and walked past me to start his day. I walked back over to my desk and finished preparing for my shift. 



I’ve been keeping a close eye on Wilson, and for the most part, he hasn’t shown any signs of melting into a horrible monster. Sometimes I notice that his face looks a little lopsided, but after I tell Dr. Harrison it's usually a quick fix. What surprised me most about the incident was that nobody reported it. Nobody so much as talked about it besides the three of us. 



I’m in a dilemma of being paid very well and now being safely guarded at my work. And yet there’s still this nagging feeling in the back of my mind, that something horrible is just lurking below the surface. 



And that also something keeps stealing from the lost and found.
