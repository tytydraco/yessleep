There’s a county in South Carolina where urban legends thrive. Ghost stories, surreal encounters, unsolved mysteries - they all reside here, in Blinkville. The validity of each of these stories is up for debate. Recently, however, I heard one I’m certain is true.  
  
My family moved to Blinkville when I was five years old. I didn’t know about Blinkville yet. I couldn’t have even told you the \*actual\* name of my county. All I knew at the time was the name of my neighborhood, which I’ll refer to as Fox Creek.  
  
Not long after moving in, a mother and her son came over from across the street to introduce themselves. The boy had short, brown hair and freckles sprinkled across his face. His name was Braden. That day, we played “Harry Potter” in my backyard, picking up sticks and pretending they were wands.  
  
I rang Braden’s doorbell often after that. One day, his mom answered and said Braden was down the street at another boy’s house. She pointed to a yellow house three doors down from mine. I braved myself as I skipped across the stepping stones that stretched the vast garden of that yellow house, pausing as I passed under the vine-entangled arbor the stones ran under. I rang the doorbell and spoke nervously when a curly-haired, blonde woman opened the door. “Is Braden here?” She seemed to gather that I was the new kid on the street and welcomed me inside, where I played GameCube with Braden and her son, Zach - a boy with buzzed, dirty blonde hair and a retainer that distorted his s’s when he spoke.  
  
We were best friends from that day forward. We went to my house to play Xbox, Braden’s for the PS2, and Zach’s for practically any Nintendo console. It made for a perfect trichotomy. Of course, our parents would often kick us out of the house and force us to play in the great outdoors. And in the evenings, you could be certain almost every kid on the street would be out playing Cops and Robbers.  
  
It was a simple game. Two teams: cops and robbers. The robbers hid and the cops searched for them. When a robber was tagged by a cop, they went to a designated “jail.” The cops won once all robbers were in jail, but the robbers were able to tag their teammates out of jail, prolonging the game. Typically, if there were still robbers out of jail an hour into the game, they were declared winners. Our street had about seven houses on either side, leading up the hill to a cul de sac. This made for a good space to play in, the boundaries being the ends of our street. However, most of the time, Dead Man’s Path was in play.   
  
Our street was in the very back of the neighborhood, Braden’s side of the street being the edge of Fox Creek. Behind the houses on Braden’s side, there was a creek that ran down, parallel to the street and fenced off in every backyard. Past this creek was a patch of woods, with a dirt path that aimlessly weaved its way through. This was Dead Man’s Path.  
  
I couldn’t tell you where the name came from. There was a story that went along with it, presumably made up by one of the older kids, as it was just as generic as the name itself. The story went that when Fox Creek was being built, one of the contractors was accidentally killed by two other contractors. Wanting to avoid a manslaughter charge, they buried him back there on Dead Man’s Path. And now, when you walk that path, you could be standing right above his vengeful soul at any moment and not even know it. And maybe his hand will burst out of the ground and pull you under to join him. It was the first Blinkville story I’d ever heard. But at the time, it was just a story.  
  
I remember thinking about it like we had three streets. The actual street we lived on, the “water street” that was the creek, and then the haunted, bizarro street that was Dead Man’s Path - all three practically parallel to one another. If you crossed the creek and then Dead Man’s Path, and kept going up through the woods, you’d find yourself at a treeline where the woods ended. Then you’d be standing in the backyards of another row of houses, in the neighborhood behind ours, which I’ll call Brookside.

The creek itself was *right* on the other side of the fence. So if you were to hop the fence, you’d either land right in the creek, or have to attempt balancing and jumping from atop the fence to the other side of the creek. There was only one real entrance onto Dead Man’s Path: the only gate in the long, stretching fence behind all those houses. It was at the top of our street, behind a house in the cul de sac. Past the gate was a thick, wood plank to walk along, over the creek and into the woods. This made Dead Man’s Path an excellent vantage point for both teams. A great place for robbers to hide, but hiding there also meant easy capture since there was only one exit. With this came an important rule: No going into Brookside. You could go on Dead Man’s Path, but if you were caught stepping foot out of the treeline and into the backyard of a Brookside house, it meant an automatic trip to jail.

When I was seven, Braden’s family moved away for work. It was temporary, but a year is a lifetime at that age. Over that year, Braden’s absence hindered Zach and I’s friendship. Nothing serious or specific, we just saw one another less. For whatever reason, Braden had been our glue.  
  
But when his family moved right back into the same house across from mine a year later, it was like nothing had changed. We were back to our old ways immediately. When it came time to play Cops and Robbers again, Zach let us in on a new discovery of his. We called it “The Secret Passage.” Two houses down from Braden’s, on the other side of the fence in Mrs. Kramer’s backyard, there was a small mound of dirt that stood just before the creek. This meant we could hop the fence one at a time, landing on this patch of dirt, then hop across the creek from there. If we kept this secret, then we’d have our own entrance onto Dead Man’s Path. Typically, the cops would send someone up to the gate to prevent any robbers from entering. This meant they’d assume there weren’t any robbers in the woods since the gate was the only entrance for all they knew. We made a promise not to tell anyone else about our secret passage, and to only use it together, when all three of us were on the same team as robbers.  
  
It was a fool proof plan. It worked every time. We were the youngest players in the game, so it felt great getting the upper hand on Zach’s older siblings and their friends. We thought we were as conniving as actual robbers.  
  
  
  
One game, we went through the secret passage and were walking around Dead Man’s Path, closer to the Brookside end of the woods. Zach had a walkie talkie clipped to his shorts so we could strategize with the other robbers - namely, his older sister. When she asked where we were hiding, he brattily told her it was a secret. She answered with a groan and presumable eye roll. The three of us were wandering, likely debating something to do with Pokémon, when a voice called out to us.  
  
“Hey there!” The three of us were used to hearing this raspy, southern inflection from older folk around South Carolina. Since we knew from the jump it was an older man yelling at us, we promptly assumed we were in trouble. We were ready to hit him with a, “Technically, we’re not on your property!” when he continued. “What’re you boys up to?”  
  
We looked over to the back porch the voice was coming from. All of the houses in Brookside looked identical from the back, aside from a unique decoration here or there. It was a long row of white clapboards and black roofs. Each back porch was a wall of white paneling, with black screen windows all around it. We could see into the upper half of each porch, but the screens still obscured our view a good bit. Only one of the porches was occupied at that moment, a little to our left, and I could make out the white head of hair and beard sitting inside. I could see a pair of bright, blue eyes staring out at us, piercing through the dark veil of the screen window.  
  
“Um…playing Cops and Robbers,” Braden answered.  
  
“Oh!” The old man exclaimed. “You fellas back here looking for robbers then?”  
  
“No, we’re the robbers. We’re hiding from the cops.”  
  
The man let out a hardy laugh. He turned to an open window to his upper left, and called out, “Honey, we’ve got three little robbers in our backyard!” He turned back to us without waiting for a reply from inside, “These woods must make for a good hiding place, huh?”  
  
All of the anxiety had been wisped away after it was clear the man wasn’t angry. “Yeah! I found a secret passage from our neighborhood to yours, so they have no idea we’re here,” Zach bragged.  
  
“Well look at that!” We heard the man slap his knee. “So you guys are from Fox Creek?”  
  
“Yes, sir,” I answered with the politeness my parents had hammered into me.  
  
The man laughed again, then, in a completely different voice, “The robbers have been spotted behind some old fart’s house. I repeat, the robbers have been spotted behind some old fart’s house!” The voice was that of a cop’s. It was unmistakable. Something about it was so cliche and cartoony that it was that recognizable. His voice sounded younger, authoritative, and had a bit of an accent. I remember being unsure if it was even the old man who had said it, but Zach and Braden’s laughter killed my suspicions.  
  
“How did you do that?” Braden said, awestruck.  
  
“How did you do that?” The man replied, in Braden’s voice.  
  
I was glaring through the sunlight at the screen window, and could see the man’s mouth moving as he imitated Braden. It wasn’t a perfect impression, but it was damn close. This one had Zach and I cracking up.  
  
“That’s not how I sound!” Braden said, chuckling.  
  
“That’s \*exactly\* how you sound,” Zach giggled.  
  
“That’s \*exactly\* how you sound,” the man said in Zach’s voice.  
  
We went on rolling in laughter. He’d mimicked Zach’s retainer-induced lisp and everything. Normally, Zach hated if people mocked the buzz he made when sounding his s’s, but the old man wasn’t mocking Zach teasingly, he was replicating his exact sound.  
  
“Hi! My name’s Jason,” I said, knowing he’d do an impression of me next.  
  
“Hi! My name’s Jason!” The man mimicked.  
  
I giggled along with Zach and Braden, but under all the wonder and excitement, something about it troubled me. It was like hearing my voice in a video. How it sounds slightly different when hearing your voice from another source. And I could recognize that this meant it was truly accurate. Nevertheless, the conversation continued and the feeling left me.  
  
“And I’m Braden and this is Zach!”  
  
“It sure is nice to meet you boys,” the man seemed to nod towards us. “My name’s Bill, but since I’m your elder, I suppose you guys’ll have to call me \*Mister\* Bill!” He laughed as if the idea of him having a title was ridiculous.  
  
“How do you do that?” Zach asked, clearly referring to Mr. Bill’s precise mimicry.  
  
“Let’s just say, when you’re this old, you’ve had plenty of time to practice!” Mr. Bill let out another chuckle. “It’s just about the only talent I’ve got!”  
  
And of course, we went on asking him to do more impressions.  
  
“Do a robot!”  
  
“Make frog noises!”  
  
“Do an alien voice!”  
  
“Bark like a dog!”  
  
And Mr. Bill did them all, impressing us further with each one. Eventually, he changed the subject. I assumed he was getting sick of performing for us.  
  
“How long you fellas been out here today?”  
  
“Probably an hour,” Zach surmised.  
  
“Oh Lord,” Mr. Bill seemed to fan his face. “In this heat? I bet you boys could use some popsicles!”  
  
The three of us celebrated, causing Mr. Bill to chuckle some more. Zach’s walkie talkie sputtered as Mr. Bill got up and said, “Just stay over there until I come back! I’ll try to be quick!” I saw his silhouette move inside, hearing his sliding, back door open and shut. Zach unclipped his walkie as his sister came through on the other end.  
  
“Where are you dorks?”  
  
Braden and I high fived. It was a perfect day. We were in our ideal hiding spot, and were about to be served popsicles. The stars were aligning.  
  
“Not telling,” Zach teased.  
  
“No, I don’t care about your stupid hiding spot,” she replied. “We’re all in jail! You need to come tag us out!”  
  
“Crap!” Braden exclaimed as if using an expletive.  
  
“They’re all split up looking for you guys,” Zach’s sister explained. “Come get us while they’re gone!”  
  
“Okay,” Zach responded in agitation.  
  
All three of us looked over at Mr. Bill’s back porch. No sign of him.  
  
Then Zach ran over to the house.  
  
“What the-?” Braden looked at me, and I matched his concerned face.  
  
“Hold on,” Zach called back to us as he stepped up the porch.  
  
“Zach!” Braden whisper-yelled over to him. “They’re looking for us! They could come running down Dead Man’s Path any second!”  
  
I was busy nervously scouting out the woods behind us. I didn’t spot any cops.  
  
“I know, I know,” Zach replied, “But he’ll be back out here any second. I’ll just grab the popsicles and we can go!” Zach stood in the doorway of the porch, leaning back against the open screen door.  
  
“You’re in Brookside!” I shouted.  
  
“I \*know\*, butt face,” Zach shot back. “No one’s gonna see me if I’m quick enough.”  
  
Zach looked into the house through the sliding glass door that stood before him. He looked back at us, frowning. He pointed back to the door with his thumb. “...he doesn’t have anything inside his hous-.”  
  
“Hey!” It was Mr. Bill’s voice. Not only was it startling - he sounded angry. “I told you to wait over there!”  
  
Zach hopped down, over all three porch steps, at the sound of Mr. Bill’s voice. The screen door clapped shut. I searched the porch for Mr. Bill. The sliding glass door on the porch hadn’t opened. Then I saw his head in the open window. Zach was staring up at him through the porch’s screens.  
  
Mr. Bill simmered down, “Eh…sorry, sorry, I just…I \*told\* you to wait over there.”  
  
“Sorry…,” Zach apologized quietly.  
  
“Um, well…that’s alright.” As Mr. Bill spoke, the charm and cordialness began to grow back into his tone. “I was gonna say, we’re all out of popsicles. But - we’ve got plenty more treats for y’all to choose from if you wanna come on in and take a gander! Candy, soda, chips - you name it!”  
  
Zach made his way back over to us as Braden answered dramatically. “Sorry Mr. Bill, but we gotta go! We got a call on the walkie talkie saying that the cops could be on their way over here!”  
  
“Oh…oh okay,” Mr. Bill sounded disappointed. I felt bad. The big, blue eyes that didn’t seem to blink now appeared somber to me. “Well, remember to come by any time! I’ll be here,” he said in a very cheery voice. I remember thinking I \*would\* come back. Just to say hi, if nothing else.  
  
As we went back to Fox Creek and continued playing, Braden seemed to agree.  
  
“We have another secret now,” he celebrated. “Free candy! We could stop by Mr. Bill’s every time we take the Secret Passage.”  
  
I was about to agree when Zach countered. “We can’t keep going back there.” Something had been off with him since we’d left. I assumed he was just upset about Mr. Bill yelling at him. “Everyone’s gonna catch on if we keep hiding there every time.”  
  
The two of them quarreled about it for some time. Even though they were only a year older, that always left them to be the decision makers. We didn’t hide out on Dead Man’s Path as often after that. Truth be told, the game was more fun when we didn’t have that trick up our sleeves. I do remember going back there once or twice after that, but we weren’t particularly searching for Mr. Bill. We didn’t hear him call out to us, and we couldn’t even tell which house was his. We’d only ever seen it from the back, a carbon copy of every other back porch in Brookside.  
  
  
  
Then, about a month later, Braden went missing. We were out playing one night, just like any other, and my parents made me come home early. I always had to go home earlier than everyone else. My mom woke me up the next morning with a distressed look I hadn’t seen before. And she told me. Braden hadn’t come home the night before.  
  
I was in denial. I thought he was gonna turn up by the time I’d gotten home from school. That he’d just slept over at someone else’s house without telling his parents. But no. In the following weeks, there were search parties and fliers, but no Braden.  
  
Braden’s parents moved away again, and Zach and I started to hang out less and less. Just like when Braden had moved with his parents a year prior. I went on to fourth grade and eventually Zach and I only saw one another when we’d happen to cross paths. He was the grade above me, so I never had any classes with him.  
  
  
  
It was in fourth grade when I first heard about Blinkville. The nickname for our county, derived from the abundance of strange stories people share here. The original storyteller is never left with any proof of whatever happened. “Blink and you’ll miss it.”  
  
My friends and I were obsessed with Blinkville stories. The Brunswick Mall Murders, The Devil’s Den, The Dancing Skeletons, The Banshee House. These were the most popular of the bunch -  all urban legends that were connected to our very town. Through middle school, we’d share any we’d heard and ramble on about theories and whether the tales were true or not. Of course, plenty of kids lied, but that only made it better. I remember creating my own story about a local sasquatch, and the tale ended up spreading around school. By the end of the week, another kid was telling the story back to me, unaware that I was the original creator.  
  
By high school, Blinkville began to mean something different to me. I thought about it more critically. There had to be a reason all these stories were being told in the first place. Some of them \*must\* have some truth to them. I learned that there \*had\* been murders in the now-abandoned Brunswick Mall. There \*were\* dead animals lying around Devil’s Den. The Dancing Skeleton case \*did\* have an official police report. And I could drive by the Banshee House myself, and see the dead trees in the front yard that \*do\* bend away from the house, and I \*could\* feel the knot in my stomach that told me to keep on driving and not come back. And there \*were\* more missing children here than in any other county in the state.  
  
Then I went off to college, returning to Blinkville four years later to stay with my parents as I was job searching. I hadn’t forgotten about all the Blinkville stories, of course, but I’d kind of grown out of them. They were a childhood obsession, all born out of some real life mystery. 

With all of my friends either still in school or working a job in another state, I was left hopelessly bored. One night, I went through my closet with a bottle of wine at my side. I went through old school projects, forgotten love letters, and some childhood journals that I’d never kept up with for more than a couple months. In one, I found this entry:

“March 6th,

Me Zach and Braden met a man named Mr. Bill today. He was really good at making voices. He even did our voices. He was gonna give us popsicles but we had to leave. We might go see him again.”

It all came back to me. That day, Mr. Bill, the voices. I hadn’t forgotten any of it completely, but I couldn’t have told you the last time Mr. Bill had crossed my mind. It’s like my brain had almost conceptualized the whole thing as a dream. Something that I must be misremembering. A real thing that happened, but layered with the surrealism of a child’s imagination.  
  
Looking back on the situation now, it was a shockingly blatant stranger danger scenario. An old man luring children into his house with candy. I just hadn’t seen it that way as an eight year old. And those voices he’d done. Our own voices. That’d happened, right? I wrote it in my journal the day of, so it must have. This whole time, I may have had a real Blinkville story of my own. I had to talk to Zach.  
  
  
  
I knew Zach was still staying at his parents place. I’d seen him walking his dog over the past couple years when I’d come home from college for the summer. And his car was still parked out front of that yellow house. I had no idea if he’d gone to college or what he’d been up to. The one social media account I could find didn’t seem to be active over the past year, and my direct message was not met with a reply. I was gonna have to do this the old fashioned way.  
  
I made my way down my street, to that yellow house I’d walked to so many times in my youth, with a six pack of beer. I walked across the stepping stones, passing under the metal arbor tangled in vines, and rang the doorbell. Zach’s dad answered. A round, burly man who made for a funny contrast to Zach’s lankiness.  
  
I was relieved to hear some recognition in his voice. “Hey...!”  
  
He had no idea who I was. Nevertheless, he at least recognized that I was an old friend of Zach’s, and that’s more than I was expecting.  
  
I told him I was there to catch up with Zach. He let me inside, asking, “You remember the way up?” I was about to say I wasn’t sure, but I looked towards the staircase and it all came back to me. It might sound weird, but I recognized the smell of the house too. That familial aroma specific to people’s homes. I was overcome with nostalgia.  
  
I walked up the staircase, and before I knew it, I was standing outside of his bedroom door. I knocked before I could talk myself into leaving. I was met with a “Come in,” from an unrecognizable voice.  
  
I opened the door and let out a, “Hey.” Zach looked over and raised his eyebrows. “Hey…” His hair was grown out now, with a curliness I’d never gotten to see in our adolescence. “Jason. Wow. What’s up?”  
  
I awkwardly stepped in through the doorway and gestured with the six pack. “Just…wanted to see if you’d like to catch up.”  
  
His smile relieved me immensely. Up until then, I wasn’t sure if he’d seen my message and just ignored it. He offered me the seat at his desk and moved over to sit on his bed.  
  
“I hope I’m not intruding,” I said, handing him a beer before sitting.  
  
“Oh no,” Zach assured me. He motioned to his laptop and opened the can. “I’m always looking for an excuse to avoid work.”  
  
And from there, the conversation carried on with an exceptional naturalness that I would’ve never expected. We went backwards, talking about college, then high school, then middle school. Filling each other in on what we’d missed. The progressive, mutual ending to our friendship years ago didn’t hang in the air like I thought it would have. We had never had a falling out, our relationship had just dissipated naturally, and we both seemed to be aware of that.  
  
Even when we got to talking about those glory years, running up and down our street and playing video games, it was purely reminiscent and tender. He even mentioned Braden. I’d been avoiding bringing him up. I was here to ask about Mr. Bill and found myself helplessly unsure of how I was going to. But he broke the threshold, and if he was willing to bring up Braden, then the conversation would be more approachable than I’d thought.  
  
We finished laughing about a story when it quieted down for a second. 

Then I went for it.

“Do you remember this one time…we were on Dead Man’s Path and an old man was on his back porch?”  
  
I saw something in his eyes. He didn’t answer and I anxiously filled the dead air. “Mr. Bill? I think that was his name.”  
  
“Yeah,” Zach looked down at his hands as he picked at a nail. “That was his name.”  
  
“I just…I was just reminded of him the other day…and-.”  
  
“Is that why you came over?”  
  
Shit. Guilt and shame overwhelmed me. I’d been too obvious. I hadn’t come over just to catch up with an old friend, and I’d just shown my hand. Zach must’ve seen this on my face because he continued.  
  
“It’s okay if it is. I get it. Really.” He brushed his stubble for a second. “It’s just…if that’s why you came here, then you should know everything.”  
  
I frowned, gave him a concerned look. Was there that much to the story I was missing?  
  
“Yeah. I’m sorry. I was reminded of him the other day and there’s not anyone else I can talk to about it.”  
  
“What do you remember?”  
  
So I told him. Everything I recounted earlier. And then it was his turn. Everything he recounted was the same, leading up to when he ran up the porch stairs.  
  
“I could see into the house through his sliding, glass door. First thing I noticed was how dark it was. Not a single light was on in there. It didn’t look like \*anything\* was in there. I couldn’t spot a couch, a TV…I might’ve seen a table, but the place just looked empty for the most part. I started letting you guys know that when Mr. Bill returned.”  
  
Zach took a breath. “Scared the shit out of me. I mean, when an adult yells at you as a kid, you just feel wrong. Especially when it’s a stranger.”  
  
He began fiddling with the tab of his can as he stared off, frowning as he recounted the details. “As he spoke to us and apologized for yelling - I could see his face. It was dark in the house, and he was behind the screens of the porch and only visible within that window, but I could see enough. Something was wrong with his face. It was very pale. It looked like that white beard and wispy head of hair were \*attached\* to his head, not grown from it. And his eyes…they were fake.” Zach snapped his fingers. “I just knew, right away, that the blue irises staring back at me weren’t real. I don’t think he ever blinked.” He shook his head. “They were painted or something. Plastic maybe. I don’t know, but they were synthetic for sure. They were unmoving as he stood in the window, staring off in our direction. Just white with blue circles and black dots in the middle. Lifeless.”  
  
“The way his mouth was moving too - it’s like it was out of sync with his words. It didn’t match. He started to back away from the window, obscuring my view even more. I think he could tell I had a better view of him than he’d like. Even with those fake eyes, as he spoke, enticing us cheeringly, I could tell he was leering out at me from the dark. I started walking back to you guys, I’d seen enough anyways. The whole thing made me feel so uneasy. Getting yelled at and then turning around only to peek at that vague mask of a face. Like half of it was a mask and half was his actual face.”  
  
“And that’s why you didn’t want to go back there,” I concluded.  
  
“Yeah…I kind of made excuses for Mr. Bill in my head. He was an old man, and maybe he had some disease or condition I was unaware of. It didn’t matter, though. I didn’t want to experience that again. I knew deep down he was malicious in some way.”  
  
And then, somberly, he said, “But Braden wanted to go back…”  
  
“Right,” I answered, almost hesitating.  
  
It got quiet again. Just a couple minutes ago we had been finishing one another’s sentences, talking about old times. Now I was searching for anything to add. But then I noticed Zach seemed to be thinking of what to say next.  
  
“That wasn’t the only time I saw Mr. Bill.”  
  
Pathetically, all I could let out was, “Oh.” The yarn ball I’d set out to unravel was bigger than I’d thought. I went in expecting to be surprised if things had happened as I'd remembered them, let alone hearing about missing details I'd never considered in the first place. “When-? How?”  
  
“I was in high school. My dog, Daisy - I used to take her to walk on Dead Man’s Path. It was a nice spot. The shade is great in the summer, tons of birds chirping and running water softly trickling in the creek. I’d mostly forgotten about Mr. Bill. Told myself the same things, he was just an old man with a deteriorated face that had scared me from within a dark house.”

“Daisy’s not an aggressive dog. I don't know what your impression is of pit bulls, but Daisy's the sweetest. She’ll bark at anything that walks by the house, but if the window isn’t between her and another animal, and it’s just them next to one another, she won’t do more than sniff. So with Dead Man’s Path almost always being empty, I could let her off the leash. The most she’d do is dart after a squirrel, but she’d come running back if I gave her a yell. She’s a good listener.”

“But one day we were back there and I saw her freeze, ears pointed like daggers. Something out of our view had gotten her attention. This wasn’t abnormal. After a while, though, I thought it was weird. She’d usually make up her mind whether to investigate a noise or not within a couple seconds. Chase after it or get distracted by something else. But she sat there listening as I watched her in her transfixed state. And then I heard it. Quietly, almost out of range, there was a growling.”

“Then Daisy was off. She darted in this growl’s direction. I yelled after her as I tried to catch up and she completely ignored me. She slowed down as she entered a backyard, slowly approaching a screen door. One of many identical screen doors in that row of back porches.”

“She was hunched forward, her gritted teeth grazing the grass, growling ahead at this screen door.  I caught up to her. It was then that I noticed the door was sitting wide open. It was evening at this point. The skies were a dark grey and a very light rain had begun to fall. I glanced up to the porch while trying to get a handle on Daisy. I wasn't really looking at what was on the porch. It was getting dark out and I was fumbling with Daisy's collar and leash, but this ferocious growl was obviously coming from there. It sounded like a dog, but a dog of horrific size. And something must’ve been holding that door open. It was just wide open to this darkened porch.”

“I had one hand on Daisy’s collar and one on the leash. As I tried to clip it on, Daisy lunged for the stairs. She brought me with her. Her paws clambered up one step, then another, as I leaned backwards, yanking her back down. Now I could see a figure on the porch. A person with white skin. I figured it was the owner of whatever monster dog was there on the porch. I figured that’s why the dog hadn’t gone for us. They were holding it back. But then I was wondering why they hadn’t said anything. And then I saw that there was no dog. It was just this person, holding the door open, and growling.”

“I got the leash on Daisy’s collar and yanked and yanked and heaved her out of that yard. I got over to the next house. Daisy was still barking like crazy and trying to head in the direction of the door, but I had a good grip on the leash now. I noticed the growling from the porch had stopped. My mind was still racing, panicked. I couldn’t piece together what the hell had just happened. There hadn’t been a dog there, I was certain. Then the porch door slammed shut. I shot back around, only to find it slowly creaking back open.”

“Zach…!” Zach heard from within that back porch. “Zach…!” In a playful, child’s voice.

“I knew it was his voice. I don’t know how. I don’t know what about it made it clear to me, but it was Braden’s voice coming from that porch.”

“This face came peeking out of the doorway, into what little daylight was left. It was white. Plain white. It was smiling at me. And as it spoke in Braden’s voice, the words seemed to be leaving its mouth at a delay. Like a second after its mouth moved, I could hear it call my name. Its eyelids were drooping. I thought it didn’t have eyes. That its sockets were empty. But as I looked on, I could see that there were dark pupils staring out at me, from deeper within those sockets."

Zach went back to describing what he heard, as this pallid face with encaved eyes went on calling out to him from that porch door.

“Zach…!” It pantomimed a childish tease in Braden’s voice. “It’s been so long…!”

“I ran off with Daisy after that. Into Brookside. Into the front yard of the house I was standing in. I just-I couldn’t have that thing looking at me any longer, couldn't hear Braden's voice again. I had to get out of its range. I ran into the street and…and I looked back at the house that that *thing* had been in. I think just to make sure it wasn’t looking at me through one of the front windows. The house looked plain. There was a ‘For Sale’ sign in the front yard.”

Zach looked in my direction for the first time since he’d started this story.

“That was him, Jason. That was Mr. Bill. Without his fake hair and eyes and whatever else. But that wasn’t the same house. Do you remember? We were far from my house that day we first met him. We went through the secret passage and walked down - must’ve been four or five more houses. Right?” Zach seemed desperate for confirmation. Like he felt he was right, but couldn’t trust himself with remembering something from so long ago correctly.

“Yes.” I answered, staring off as I tried to picture it. “We walked further down Dead Man’s Path that day.”

“But when walking Daisy, I never went far from my house. He was in a different house.” 

“I swear, there’s always an empty house in Brookside. I’ve driven through there occasionally since I saw him with Daisy. There’s *always* at least one ‘For Sale’ sign. And I think he moves between whichever ones are vacant, and finds any way he can to lure someone inside.”

“I mean, there are hundreds of thousands of vacant homes in South Carolina. Maybe he can move between them all somehow. Maybe at night, when no one’s out. Do you think?”

I could feel it coming off Zach. The desperation for relation. He’d kept this in for so long, probably not telling anyone. Maybe all true Blinkville stories haven’t been told. Maybe we only ever hear the hackneyed, deluded version, like the word at the end of a game of telephone.

“That could be right.”  I answered. I was still processing all of this. The fact that I had been involved in any way. The fact that he was using Braden's voice all those years later. Zach had thought this whole thing through for *years* and I was just comprehending it.

“Who knows how long he’d been watching me when I’d walk Daisy back there? Planning something.”

Zach started to ramble - to blurt it all out. “He took Braden and then he tried to take me. He took Braden that night, that last night we saw him. Braden went through the secret passage without us because he wanted to see Mr. Bill again. He broke the promise, the promise to never go alone. When I saw that pale face smiling, calling to me in Braden’s voice, it was so malicious and teasing. If he couldn’t have me, he wanted to at least make sure that I knew he took Braden.”

With that, Zach had gotten it all out. His story, his theories. He’d finally told somebody. And I was glad it was me. I was glad that after all these years, I could still be there for him, as a friend. I tried comforting him after that. I’m unsure I did a great job. But I could tell getting the whole thing off his chest was comfort enough for him.  
  
I don’t know how successful I’ll be, but I plan on finding others around Blinkville who have their own stories. Nobody else seems to be getting these stories out there. And if these experiences have been weighing people down the same way Zach’s has, it could be for good reason. Maybe it could even save someone’s life. Until then, stay safe. Take the local urban legends you hear with a grain of salt, but keep them with you. You never know which parts of them could be true.
