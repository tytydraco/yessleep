Starting a job as a security guard was never part of my plan, but with a felony on my record, I was running out of options, and my bank account was on life support. The idea of working at the infamous Oakwood Mall during the holiday season sent shivers down my spine. A friend told me about the job opening, and despite my reservations, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. The mall had a dark past, starting with that event that happened back in the 90s, I'm sure you know of it; it still appears on the news occasionally, especially around this time of year. Now, as the mall prepared to close its doors for good, it was my responsibility to stand guard during its last days. When I arrived for my first graveyard shift, I entered the security office and found a letter on the table from my boss, containing a series of weird rules I had to follow. It read:

Dear New Hire,

Welcome to the Oakwood Mall security team. To help you navigate your first graveyard shift, I've compiled a list of rules you must follow. Please read them carefully and adhere to them throughout your shift.

1.) Make sure to patrol the mall every hour, checking for any unlocked doors, potential hazards, or suspicious activity. If there’s anything that you think you should do as a security guard, then do it. This isn't the hardest job in the world; although it can be one of the most dangerous.

2.) Keep a detailed log of any incidents or irregularities you encounter during your shift. This will be important for my review when I return.

3.) If you encounter any technical issues with the security cameras, leave a message for management as well as a text on my phone.

4.) If you notice a section of the mall where the mannequins appear to be watching you, do not linger, it's not just your imagination. Quickly move on and avoid eye contact. They have been known to anger when observed for too long.

5.) Remember that you're supposed to be the only person in the mall during your shift. If you encounter a janitor who seems out of place or unfamiliar, do not engage with him. Trust me, he isn't a guy you wanna get to know and you don't want to hear what he has to say, especially about women and children. Keep in mind that isn't how our janitor's uniform looks. Just continue your patrol as if he isn't there.

6.) You may hear intense crying coming from the restroom areas. Do not investigate. Continue your patrol and the crying will eventually stop abruptly.

7.) If you receive frantic phone calls from stores that no longer exist in the mall, or from stores that do exist… do not engage in conversation. Simply hang up and continue your duties.

8.) You may come across a store that seems to be rearranged or altered since your last patrol. Do not enter the store or attempt to fix the changes. Ignore it and continue your patrol. Ignore that voice crying for your help too, can’t do anything for them now

9.) During your patrols there's an extremely rare chance you might come across an emptied janitorial cart left unattended. If you know what's good for you, you will finish your patrols quickly. Our love-starved pal might be feeling blue again.

10A.) In the event that the mall's PA system starts playing old holiday music, immediately shut it down using the controls in the security office. The music can trigger certain events from the past. I don't care if you're on the 2nd floor balcony, jump down and shut that PA system off without hesitation! Let the past stay in the past.

10B.) If after you shut down the PA system you hear distant pops resembling gunshots, immediately lock yourself in the security office and play a non-Christmas song at full volume. This should help to drown out the screams and protect you from any time loops. Stand clear of that door and make sure it's LOCKED! Only emerge from the office when your shift is over.

11.) If while doing your rounds you notice distant ghostly silhouettes running towards you, immediately turn and run away from them as fast as you can. They aren't dangerous, but whatever they're running from is.

12.) While patrolling the food court, you may notice some of the chairs or tables moving on their own. Keep your distance and try not to look at what's under them.

13.) If you come across a bloodied and broken mannequin laying in the middle of the main entry way, do not acknowledge it. It will likely be gone by the time your shift is over.

14.) A group of children are usually seen laughing and playing in the ball pen around 3AM, keep in mind that I've closed and completely cleared the mall before your shift has even started. Avoid making contact or interacting with them. Let them enjoy their eternity.

15.) Lastly and perhaps most important. Never under any circumstances attempt to leave the mall before the scheduled end to your shift. The last guard didn't heed my warning and he was found that morning gunned down at the front door, dressed in an old janitor's uniform from the 90s. No evidence has been found, but veteran cops said it seemed very familiar... Don't let it happen to you!

Your shift ends at 6:00AM. Leave exactly at that time and not one second before. The deconstruction team should be waiting at the door when you leave. Let them in and tell them to stick together, the mall will fight back. They will likely be confused, don't answer their questions, leave immediately. Report back Monday for your last shift before you head out to the second location.

Your safety is our top priority. Please adhere to these rules, and you should have a smooth and relatively uneventful shift. Please do not call me. If you do, I wont answer.

Wishing you the best of luck,

Tony

I must admit I got a good chuckle after reading that. I assume this is a prank they play on all new hires who work the holiday shift here. I quickly go to use the security restroom to come back to Jingle Bell Rock playing on the PA system, god I hate that song. Just about as soon as I plop down in the seat to check the cameras, a series of loud pops fill the air. Wait, is that screaming? They got a sick fucking sense of humor here don't they?
