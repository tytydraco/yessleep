It's been a couple of days since I saw the figure in my doorway. I've been trying to convince myself I was just half asleep, and my mind was just playing tricks on me, but ever since then, I've been feeling like I'm being watched. 

I can still hear noises coming from Pam's apartment, and I've tried talking to the building manager about it, but he isn't answering his door.  That's unusual for him. It's no secret that I don't like the guy, but I can't help wonder if something happened to him. I've tried a few times over the past 3 days to talk to him about the noise but nothing. I can't help but feel like this building is starting to mess with my mind, I need to get out of here. 

I haven't seen any weird shadows since the last time, but somehow, I got lost while doing laundry today. I've lived in this building for 5 years, and I don't even know how it's possible to get lost. I live on the second floor, and the laundry room is on the first floor near the back exit, but somehow, I kept getting turned around. I went into the elevator and pressed 1, go down the hallway, and when I get to the door that should be the laundry room, I'm at my apartment again? I've been really tired, so I figured I pushed the wrong button and went back to the elevator to repeat the process again, and once again, I'm back at my apartment door. 

I try to dismiss it as something as simple as a broken elevator, but I honestly don't believe it myself. I stood on the elevator, I felt the elevator moving,  but I keep ending up on the second floor. I decided to take the stairs instead, but I don't understand. It doesn't matter how many stairs I go down, I never reach the first floor. I feel like I'm going nuts. After what felt like 5 flights of stairs, I started walking back up and immediately find a door to the first floor? There isn't a basement level, there should not be any stairs beyond the first floor, so where was I? 

I continued to the laundry room, and after putting everything into the wash, I stepped out the back door for a cigarette.  You know when you get a feeling of impending doom? Well. I have an anxiety disorder, so I get them often. When I was finishing my cigarette, every instinct was screaming at me not to go back inside, but of course I didn't listen. As I was returning to my apartment, these hallways felt unending. Like a labynth constantly turning in on itself. I finally get back to my apartment, but the clock says I've been gone for 3 hours. 

As I write this, I still can't comprehend what happened. I swear I was only gone for 10 minutes, but 3 hours? And now that I'm back, I feel trapped again. I typically spend a lot of time on my balcony, but I can't bring myself to go back out there after what happened, so I crack open my window and blow the smoke out through the crack. Truthfully,  this feels wrong, but I can't get the image of Pam's ghost staring at me. I know that sounds crazy, but what else could that thing have been? And why is it haunting me? 

When I finished smoking, I was going to go back to the laundry room to switch my laundry, but there it was. As soon as I opened the door there it stood. Have you ever gotten a good look at a shadow person? As the name implies, I thought a shadow person would be, well, a shadow. But that's not quite it.  Eyes like empty holes in its skull, its nose was long narrow slits and its skin so black it absorbed all light. From a distance, I thought it was Pam's ghost, but this thing? This thing is not Pam, or anything human for that matter. I slammed the door and ran as far into my apartment as I could. 

As I run into my bedroom and get my bat, I can hear the noise grow louder in Pam's apartment. I could hear clattering and slamming on the walls, and it grew so loud that everything on my walls began to shake so vigorously that picture frames fell and shattered. It's embarrassing to admit, but I began to scream, "Stop it! Stop it!" I repeated as I cowered in the corner covering my ears.  I can't take this anymore, I have to get out of here, but I can't open that door again. As much as I hate the idea of it, I went back out to my balcony for the first time since the other night. If I can't leave through the front door, I'll jump from my balcony. It won't be fun, but I know I can survive the fall. At least that's what I thought. Looking over the ledge, I can't see the ground. It's as if I'm at the top of a sky scraper, but this building has never been that tall. It's only supposed to be 3 stories.

I can't believe it, but for the first time in 10 years, I tried calling my brother, but all I get is Static. My brother and I haven't talked since our mother died, but I needed someone to pull me out of this hell. As I type this now, I'm not even sure there's any point. I think it's too late, I'm already trapped.
