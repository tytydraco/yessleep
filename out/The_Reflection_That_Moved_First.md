I noticed it for the first time while brushing my teeth. It was just a split second , a trick of the eye, I told myself. My reflection blinked... before I did.

I froze, toothbrush hanging from my mouth, foam dribbling onto my chin. The mirror version of me stood there, staring back, as if nothing had happened. I chuckled nervously and shook my head. I was just tired.

That’s what I told myself.

But then it happened again.

And again.

At first, it was small things. A blink. A smirk that lingered a second too long. A slight tilt of the head, as if the reflection were listening to something I couldn’t hear.

One night, I decided to test it. I raised my hand, wiggling my fingers, watching the mirror carefully. Perfect synchronization. Then, heart pounding, I moved my hand slower, drawing out the movement.

Halfway up, my reflection twitched , and then snapped into place, catching up as if it had lagged behind.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the sink. My reflection did not.

It stood there, unmoving, grinning at me.

I turned off the light and left the bathroom, refusing to look back.

By the next day, I had convinced myself I was imagining things. Stress. Lack of sleep. That was all.

But I couldn’t shake the unease that crawled under my skin every time I passed a reflective surface. Windows. Storefront glass. My phone screen. I swore I saw something off—a flicker of motion that didn’t match my own.

Then, last night, it changed.

I woke up around 3 AM, throat dry, craving water. I shuffled out of bed, heading for the kitchen. The hallway was dim, my body moving on autopilot. And then, out of the corner of my eye—I saw it.

My reflection.

Not in a mirror. Not in glass.

Standing in the darkness of my bedroom doorway.

It didn’t move. It didn’t breathe. But I knew what it was.

I bolted for the light switch. The bulb flickered, then steadied, flooding the room with warmth.

There was nothing there.

But my bedroom mirror was fogged up—as if something had **just stepped through it.**

I barely slept after that. Every time I closed my eyes, I imagined it standing over me, waiting. I started avoiding mirrors altogether. I even draped a sheet over the one in my bedroom. But it didn’t help.

Tonight, as I lay in bed, my phone screen lit up—on its own. A notification popped up.

**“Come back to the mirror.”**

My breath hitched. My fingers trembled as I reached for my phone, but before I could touch it, the screen went black.

I heard something shift in the darkness. A faint, slow creak of the closet door easing open.

I don’t want to look.

But I know it’s already watching me.

Then, something cold brushes against my ankle.

I yank the covers over my head, heart pounding. My breathing is too loud. Too fast. My fingers dig into the sheets as I try to convince myself it’s nothing.

But I hear it whisper now.

A voice that sounds exactly like mine.

"Let me in."

I squeeze my eyes shut. This isn’t real. It can’t be real.

Then I hear the sound of glass cracking.

Not just a small crack , a deep, splintering **shatter.**

Slowly, I lower the blanket and force myself to look. The mirror across the room is still covered with the sheet... but the outline of something **pressing against it** is unmistakable. A shape. My shape.

A handprint pushes outward from beneath the fabric, distorting it, **stretching it.**

I scramble backward, pressing myself against the headboard. The whispering gets louder. More urgent.

"Let me in."

And then, the worst part.

The handprint **moves.** Crawling **down** the mirror like a spider. Reaching for the floor.

The sheet suddenly falls to the ground.

The mirror is empty.

I am no longer in it.

And behind me, I hear footsteps.

I whip around, heart pounding, and come face-to-face with myself.

Not my reflection.

Me.

Only, it isn’t. Its grin is too wide, its eyes too dark, swirling like deep, endless pools of ink. It cocks its head, studying me, its fingers twitching like it's getting used to them.

I try to scream, but no sound comes out. My body refuses to move.

"Finally," it sighs, stretching as if it has been trapped for centuries. "You have no idea how long I've waited for this."

I stumble backward, but my feet don't feel like they belong to me anymore. My vision wavers, like looking through water. The world around me blurs, distorting, **pulling me in.**

I turn toward the mirror, and the truth crashes over me like a tidal wave.

I'm inside it now.

Trapped.

I slam my fists against the glass, but the thing wearing my face only laughs, stepping away from the mirror, my body **no longer mine.**

I scream, but no one can hear me.

The last thing I see before the mirror turns black—before my prison seals shut—is my own stolen body walking out the door.

And then, I am alone.

Forever.
