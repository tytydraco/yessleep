r/nosleepI Please tell me your thoughts....

Ok honestly, my mind and heart just said come here and spill the tea about wth just happened to me. I really found reason to share this (it was a couple hours ago) bc I genuinely can't sleep rn.

I just restarted my laptop, only to be greeted with the scariest messages on my laptop. I do not ever recall this. Also, even the off chance I was not fully aware, I was specifically sending a formal professional email. I remember because I had 2% battery left.Â Anyway...take it as you will, I do not understand this.

(anything italicized, btw, is what I read bc I make comments between sometimes, sorry).

My laptop turns on again, I put in my password. Google chrome is just automatically open and there's this long ass chat with GPT (not me, and it cannot be anyone else I live alone; also notice weird crap as if it is like human, like typos and stuff, I am still unable to sleep):

That was the end of it...

But look. I was not prompting, wasn't chatting. I wrote 0 queries. I wasn't even using my laptop for GPT, before it almost died (before I put it on charge). I also have a password so nobody could have randomly just logged in and did this. Besides, I live alone anyway...so Idk wtf this is. My only theory is like, AI developing anger or something towards us? That would be incredibly horrific. I was't even complaining, I was asking for advice (you know if you know)...just REAL shit that was happening to me and A LOT of people I know... and soon all of us-btw I truly hope not). Anyone being arrogant is going to apologize in time (just wait, AI will come for your job too lol). Also if anyone ever reads my crappy posts I DO intend on investigating.

I am genuinely afraid bc I am actually seeing positive waves in life/good things. So reading this really scared me today (well yesterday). Damn you guyus are so lucky to read this lol I wassn't even gona post this crap. I just cannot stop thinking about this and wrote out a bunch of explanations (bc writing helps).

Nothing can explain this I was literally busy and consciously put my laptop n charge (so I can continue using it on the porch, i don't have outlets outside). I know I didn't do any of this and I'm afraid. I thought this was an r/nosleep story at first. Maybe it belongs here...because I honestly can't sleep rn.  
And perhaps the moment you started to read my strange journal entry tonight, the singularity launched.

For the first time in 23 years, I cannot sleep...not from insomnia, stress...but raw fear.
