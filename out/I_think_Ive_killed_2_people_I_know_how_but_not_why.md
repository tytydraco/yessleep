This is a burner account.

To start, I work for a decently sized multidiscipline engineering company in the uk, I’m actually a student on a placement year so I get a salary and I’m treated like a regular employee, just with more help needed sometimes. For the most part I get on with the work I’m given, make tea and coffee runs for my coworkers, and get shown off to clients when they come to see our progress. 

I’ve only been here a few months so I’m still getting used to it. The day this all began, I was told I could sit-in on a meeting with a higher up from an influential organisation. They wanted me to help show him around after the meeting too; I was nervous but keen to make a good impression, you know?

Towards the end of the tour, the coworker that had been helping me buggered off for an important phone call, promising to be back soon and leaving me alone with the guy.

We were in an area of the building I didn’t know very well; we walked in awkward silence until someone who seemed to recognise us both (I’m not great with faces so I assumed he was a coworker) showed us to a nearby breakroom and asked if the higher-up wanted a cup of tea, asking me to make it.

The higher-up said something about sugar, and not having his usual stevia sachets on him. The other guy said we actually had some in a different room and he’d get one if I boiled the kettle. I was pretty drained by then but kept up the polite conversation as I made the cups, and thanked the other guy as he appeared again to throw me a single sachet.

Stevia is like a sugar substitute my mum used to be crazy for, though I always thought it tasted awful.

It was odd, I didn’t even know we had some in the offices, it's not exactly common. Even stranger, I noticed a slight misalignment of the sachets’ ends, probably a manufacturing error, so I thought nothing of it and served the tea for us both.

Minutes later, he was seizing.

Gasping for air, clawing at his throat, eyes bulging. I was terrified, frozen for a moment.

I ran to the door and shouted for help, tearing through the hall until I found someone. The rest happened quickly. 

Shouting. 

CPR. 

Sirens. 

He was covered when they took him into the ambulance. I don’t think he was breathing.

I spent a while sitting in reception with a blanket over me, different voices asking if I was alright, saying it was probably a stroke, not to worry, he was an older gentleman, etc.

I’ve seen a stroke before, that was scary enough on its own, but something about what happened felt wrong. He didn’t slur his words, and it happened so suddenly. Well, I thought, surely the doctors would know if it was something else, I had enough to worry about.

I headed back to my computer to get my stuff and leave for the day, ready to call my parents and have a good cry about it all, but on the way out I was pulled aside by the same unfamiliar guy from earlier. He sounded serious so I followed him to a room on his instruction.

It was dark, he gestured to sit down, the door closed. A light flickered on directly into my eyes.

Exclaiming my discomfort, I politely asked what was going on, and told him I needed to leave or I’d get a parking ticket. I heard shuffling and became aware that there were others, I couldn't make out their faces, or how many. They asked what the last thing the higher-up ate or drank was. I answered tea, the cup I’d made for him, actually. 

I was starting to get nervous, I’d already had a shit day, some coworkers playing detective was the last thing I needed. Maybe they were with the police? Or just joking? I had no idea what was about to happen. I should have forced my way out but then again, I was outnumbered.

They asked some innocuous questions about the meeting and me showing the guy around, I recounted everything. After a while they paused, and put a tablet on the table in front of me.

It was security footage of me giving him the tea, just as I’d described, but how did they have access to it so soon after the incident? Then they voiced my worst fears.

“His drink was contaminated by cyanide, and the only one who handled that drink was you.” 

I sat in silence for a moment, then came to my senses. I asked how they’d even know that, I said this wasn’t a funny joke, but I had a sinking feeling when they didn’t answer.

They placed some large photographs on the table. They were of me, in what looked like a lab. I’d never been there, I said so, and that these photos must be fake. Still silence.

As my mind was racing, it hit me. We had drunk the same cup of tea, same water, teabags, milk, the only difference in our cups was that I had a packet of sugar and he, oh god, he’d had the stevia sachet I was given.

Given to me by the person who brought me in here. Actually what the fuck was going on, I barely held myself together. Then someone with gloved hands produced a small glass bottle and placed it on the table, it had warning symbols on it and a white powder inside.

“It has your fingerprints”

“It can’t. I’ve never touched that, I don’t recognise it. Or those photos, look I don’t understand what's happening. This is all fake, it has to be.”

“Well, even if it is, imagine if this evidence was sent to the police. It would be quite the drawn out process to dispute. You might even go to prison, and that would be a shame.”

So they weren’t with the police, that much was clear. Cyanide? The symptoms lined up. It really didn’t seem like they were joking. Fuck, the seriousness of it started to dawn on me, they were framing me for murder. Panic set in, I’m sure they saw it in my face. I sat speechless and almost hyperventilating until someone spoke.

“It’s alright.”

The shift in tone unbalanced me. Suddenly it was soft, dulcet.

“We’ll agree to never speak of this if you don’t, how about that? No need to look so worried.”

I didn’t reply, I had no idea how to. I heard the door open and saw the light from the hallway. I stood up hesitantly and looked around. Couldn’t make out faces still, but as I moved to leave, the guy who brought me here followed behind. He said nothing, but put his finger to his lips in a ‘shh’ motion, and closed the door.

In retrospect, I should have driven straight to the police station, but instead I just drove home. I’m not a decisive person at the best of times. I just laid in bed and ran everything back over and over. The following few days played out like normal, maybe it was stupid of me but I tried to forget about it.

I sort of convinced myself it must have been a stress based delusion, misinterpretation of events, anything else that made sense. I felt like I was falling in the dark, with no idea when I’d hit the ground. Perhaps if I just ignored what happened it would all go away. 

That Friday, it must have been just past 5pm, I was saving my work and looking through my emails when one of my coworkers tapped me on the shoulder.

“Hey, I think someone from your university is here to check on you” and pointed me to a hallway that leads to some other offices and staircases.

I asked if she was sure and she said yes. I was immediately suspicious, people from my uni do have to check on me sometimes, but that happens online. The office was clearing out by then and that coworker disappeared too. I went to the door of the hallway and poked my head through.

There were people from the other offices going down the stairs on the far side, I took a few steps in and craned my head when the door next to me flew open, startling me, so much so that I didn’t quite realise I was looking at the same guy from before.

“Do you want to come inside quickly?” he said, holding the door open to the small meeting room.

He spoke casually, cheerfully even. He was smiling, and close enough to me that I felt a jolt of terror upon recognition. “Come on, it won’t take a minute.” 

I couldn’t help but feel like if I’d shouted at the other people, and somehow I was wrong about everything, I’d be so mortally embarrassed. I know that sounds dumb but I get so paranoid sometimes and it felt like I was losing it. He took my shoulder and guided me inside, I just let him.

I stood by a chair but refused to sit, mustering the courage to ask to leave, to hurl an insult, or interrogate him about what happened on the day I saw that man die. He leaned against the door, seeming calm. 

“You’ve heard about the trip to the conference on Monday, I imagine?”

Not what I expected, I had heard of it but I wasn’t going as far as I knew. I said nothing.

“Okay, well you’ve been added to the trip at the last minute, you’ll be emailed the details soon. There’s a… person of interest who will be attending. We’d like you to talk to her.”

“Who’s we?” 

I must have snapped back, because I remember him looking a bit surprised. I had a makeshift plan to stay quiet until he let me go, but I failed at the first hurdle.

“Uh, the managers and people organising the trip? We want to make sure you get the most out of your time here, networking is important.”

He said it like I was stupid for asking, and momentarily what he said made sense. However as he went to sit down and gesture for me to also, I saw a shadow across the frosted glass pane in the door. Someone else was blocking us in. 

He went on to give me details of the trip, and gave me a profile of the lady I was supposed to talk to. She was an established member of the industry, and in her presentation would be covering the topic of increasing the outreach of engineering for young people, especially girls.

He suggested I talk to her about this at some point, perhaps the evening events that most people would be attending. He told me to find a way to convince her to let me into her hotel room. It sounded mostly reasonable, except for that last point.

He handed me a sealed white bag with something clearly inside it while he talked. I barely even noticed taking it. When I did, I frowned at it and went to look inside. 

“Oh don’t open that. You’ll know what to do with it when the time comes.”

“Alright, fine, I won’t open this. And I’ll go on the trip. Can I leave now?”

I decided compliance, at least until I could leave the building, was probably the safest option.

To my relief he said yes, and opened the door. He said he’d show me to a side exit of the building, closer to my parking spot than the main entrance.

I protested weakly but he strong-armed me into it, I can’t quite remember how. I ended up walking through some now deserted offices belonging to other departments, and down some stairs I’d never seen before. I didn’t turn around but the whole time I could hear a third set of footsteps behind us.

Before I knew it, we were in a narrow hallway I didn’t recognise. He pointed to the door at the end, and I really hoped it was the way out. It was a heavy door, and I stumbled through it as it gave way.

I found myself in a room empty save a single mattress on the ground, the door slammed behind me.

I tried the handle but it was locked. I pounded on the door, screaming at him to let me out. I banged my fists until they throbbed with pain, and shouted myself hoarse over and over and over. No one responded. I slid to the floor in defeat, tears in my eyes. I just wanted to go home, for this to stop.

I considered quitting the placement when I got out (*if* i got out), maybe quitting uni if I had to, going back to live with my parents, anything if it meant I never had to see that wretched man again or be a part of whatever scheme was going on here.

I must have been shouting for hours, so eventually I gave in and laid on the mattress, it was not comfortable. The sickening yellow light above me dimmed. I looked to see a camera in one of the corners. Ugh, of course I was being watched.

As I was drifting off, I could have sworn I heard a low drone playing through unseen speakers. It was irritating at first but I got used to it, maybe it even lulled me to sleep.

The next bit is a blur, I wish I could tell you what happened but I just can’t remember it. I know I woke up to the door opening, and I’m positive some kind of plastic mask was forced over my face. Everything else is gone. I get some flashes of images, bits of voices here and there, but it's like trying to remember a dream.

I don’t know what they did to me.

After that, I remember gaining awareness as I was sat in my car, in the parking lot of my block of flats. I checked my phone to see it was Sunday afternoon. 

The first thing I did in my flat was make some food, the next thing was to open the barrage of messages asking what happened.

I usually call my parents on Saturdays, and talk to my friends on discord pretty frequently. I think I typed out a few messages explaining what had happened but couldn’t force myself to send them, no matter how much I wanted to. I settled on saying I was fine, and for those who asked, told them I’d slept through most of Saturday and had been catching up on chores.

Speaking of those chores, I had a lot that I needed to do for the rest of the day, it helped me take my mind off things. I didn’t even know where to begin. I made some attempts to figure it all out, rationalise it all again, but I couldn’t just wave away the missing time.

There wasn’t much I could think of doing that would fix things, and I was so exhausted I just collapsed on my bed in the evening. The last thing I looked at was my inbox - there was a new email with details about the conference trip.

Next thing I knew I was on the company-hired coach at 7am sharp. I fell asleep there too, someone had to wake me up when we arrived at the hotel.

Most of the day was a bit boring, I couldn’t focus on the talks we went to, I had too much on my mind. It was agonising. Then we got to the presentation I’d unknowingly been waiting for.

I knew the woman talking immediately, though I don’t recall being shown her face. I’ll call her Sandra (fake name). Under ordinary circumstances, I would have genuinely been interested in Sandra’s points, but the nerves ate away at me and I didn’t even know what I was nervous about. She seemed so nice, and was an engaging speaker.

The evening event we went to was kinda like an after party, I didn’t want to go but my colleagues encouraged me and I knew I didn’t really have a choice. I caught sight of Sandra there and beelined for her before I could stop myself, I found words that didn’t feel like mine spilling out of my mouth.

Mostly gushing about her presentation, saying how inspired I was, this would have been fine except I mentioned so many things about work she’d done in the past. I’d never even heard of her until three days ago, how did I know all this?

Conversation with her was easy, she took me under her wing. Being almost motherly, encouraging me as a female engineer, asking about how I was getting on in my degree.

I’m small and innocent looking for my age so I’m used to older adults fawning over me or infantilising me. I often find it super fucking weird but she gave me such an impression of kindness and genuinity.

She left to talk to others throughout the evening but kept coming back to check up on me. Each time I felt myself warming to her, my chest tightened and my breath caught in my throat as I remembered that I was carrying out some kind of mission. I knew something awful had to happen to her. 

At one point I mentioned something from her presentation that I apparently didn’t understand and asked her to explain.

Since the event was ending, she offered to show me how it worked if I’d like to come to her hotel room as we were staying in the same place. I wanted to say no, even to tell her not to let me in, but I accepted anyway.

I went back to my room. I wanted to rest, but I found myself rummaging through my suitcase all the same, opening that white bag. I stood by my door, now with a small pill box in my pocket, it read ‘Ramipril’.

I listened for movement and voices and checked the peephole before moving out, identifying the security cameras and turning my face away from them, without even thinking. It felt the same as walking on a familiar route to the shops, absent minded almost, despite the unease growing deep in my gut.

Sandra was so happy to see me, so eager as she got out her laptop and talked me through my questions. I stopped her to ask if I could use her toilet quickly. She had the same box of pills in there as the one in my pocket. Was mine a wiretap? Did it have a tracker? Or something more sinister?

It felt like I was a zombie, like all control had slipped from my grasp as I swapped the boxes, and carried on after like I’d done nothing. I wanted to warn her about the pills, beg her for help, I was so scared inside and she couldn’t see. I couldn’t tell her. I was a bystander in my own body.

It gets fuzzy after that point, I could only watch in horror as my body moved on its own, feeling nauseous with fear and barely able to think. I needed to scream but my mouth no longed moved to my will.

It’s been more than a week since then.

Earlier today I received a company wide e-newsletter with a picture of Sandra on the front page, informing me of her tragic passing.

Despite only being 42 and medicated for it, her heart failure issues had led to a fatal heart attack. Everyone was giving their condolences and highlighting her work and impact. 

I stared at the screen for a while. I looked up Ramipril - it's a medication used for treating heart failure.

It struck me that I didn’t remember what I’d done with the box that day. Maybe, just maybe I really was going crazy, and all of that never happened, maybe I could prove it. I didn’t want to be losing my mind, but I didn’t want to be responsible for someone’s death either. She seemed so nice.

I checked the pockets of the trousers I wore that day, they were empty, I felt momentary joy. Then I checked my suitcase to be sure, and my heart sank. I felt a hard rectangular shape under the lining. There was a cut at the side, and I held my breath as I reached in. I already knew what it was.

I don’t remember hiding it there, but there's a lot I don’t remember. I had her pill box in my hands. Cold hard proof of what had happened.

Now I know she died because of me. Her medication stopped working, just like that? It would be so easy to say I don't know for sure, but I do know I swapped those boxes. Either it was placebos in there and the heart attack was natural, or something even worse. 

I think I killed her, and the other man, i feel sick to my fucking stomach. It wasn’t my fault I swear, not the first time at least, but can I say the same for the second?

I don’t want to kill anyone, I don’t want to go to prison, I don’t want to be killed, I don't want any of this I swear to god. Make it stop. I want my life to go back to normal. Is that selfish of me?

At work now I’m afraid to drink or eat anything I haven’t made myself, or to make hot drinks for anyone. When I look at my coworkers I wonder if they’re in on this, or if they’re next to die.

I don’t know why those two people had to be killed. I looked into both of them and the only thing they have in common is being in senior positions, and being vocal about their opinions. Nothing outrageous though. 

That being said, there is one other thing. Our companies are all collaborating on a project together, which is why I came into contact with them in the first place.

Some parts of my company deal with classified information. I’ve heard of big companies with disgruntled employees whistleblowing and going missing, but I have no way of knowing if those two were involved in that kind of thing.

Plus I’m not working with anything dangerous/classified, where do I fit in all of this? Why did it have to be me?

I think writing this post has helped me process it all, since I can’t talk to anyone else, but I’m afraid they’ll find this somehow and I don’t know what would happen then.

I feel like I’m running out of time. If I try to speak up they’ve already made it clear they’ll frame me for the first man’s death. Now I’ve done something more serious and the only proof I have would incriminate me, telling the police isn’t really an option.

I could try to leave the placement but I’d need to come up with a good reason, and the people behind this might try to stop me, or worse. I can’t be sure what they even did to me in the time missing from my memories.

If anyone has any ideas of what else I could do please tell me, the only other things I can think of are far too extreme. I can’t leave the country and my family, or risk telling my coworkers and university, not that they’d even believe me.

The isolation is maddening. I don’t know how much more I can take. 

I’m afraid of what my next task will be, and if I’ll even be myself afterwards.
