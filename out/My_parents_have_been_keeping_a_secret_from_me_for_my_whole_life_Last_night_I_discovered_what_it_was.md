My parents have been lying to me for my entire life. The information they’ve withheld has caused me to question everything I know about my upbringing. Funnily enough, it was Minecraft that led to their undoing.

I returned home after a grueling day of schoolwork, bullying, and general disgust for the sub-humans that I was forced to interact with. Middle school really takes its toll, let me tell ya. I slung my backpack to the floor and plopped into my gaming chair, eager to escape into a world devoid of relentless bullies and snobby snot-nosed pricks.

I booted up my PC and started Minecraft. This was one of those rare two-week periods where I delved back into the game. Immediately after making it past the loading screen, I noticed something strange. There was a new save file that I hadn’t created. It simply read: *Help me.*

I didn’t know what to make of it. I thought maybe there was a glitch or that I’d managed to piss off some online hacker, and this was their twisted version of a joke. So, I ignored it. I played for hours, relishing in my own undisturbed sanctum. I had nearly completed an intricate stone castle when Mom called me downstairs for dinner. I joined my parents, and the save file was all but forgotten. Until the next day.

I again returned home from another exhausting day at school, ready to kick off my shoes and enjoy my coveted alone time. I started my PC and clicked on the Minecraft icon, itching to finish that ornate structure from the previous day. I was met with another new save file. This one said: *Please help. I’m in the basement.*

A chill snaked its way up my spine and my vision grew hazy. This had to be some kind of sick prank. There wasn’t seriously someone trapped in my basement. Right? I needed to find out for myself. I clicked on the save file.

I found myself in the middle of a flat world with nothing but three signs jutting from the digital earth. I trembled in my seat as I read them.

*Please, you have to help me.*

*I’m in the basement.*

*I don’t know how long I have left.*

That last one turned my blood to ice. I didn’t have an inkling of an idea if there was anything or anyone down there, but I had to know. I decided to prod my parents about it at dinner that evening.

“Jackson! Time to eat!” Mom shrieked from the bottom of the stairs.

“Just a minute!” I yelled, briefly returning to my game before shutting it down for the night.

I slid my chair out from the table and took my seat with the rest of the family. Mom placed a plate of lamb chops in front of me before claiming her own spot opposite mine. Dad loudly smacked his steamed carrots, engulfed in his meal.

“This is really good, honey.”

“Thank you, Howard, but you were *supposed* to wait for the rest of us to sit down before you begin eating,” she nagged, raising an eyebrow at him expectantly.

“Sorry, it just looked so good. Anyway, how was school kiddo? Anything exciting happen?”

“Uh, not really. So, um, Dad, I was just wondering, purely out of curiosity, why is the basement always locked?”

Dad lowered his raised forkful of food. He stared at me. His face began to drain of color, and beads of sweat formed above his brow.

“It’s not safe down there. Uneven foundation.”

“But couldn’t that affect the whole house? Maybe we should get it looked at, you know, in case something was to happen.”

Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Mom wringing her hands. Dad’s voice quivered as he spoke.

“Your mother and I have everything under control. There’s no need to go down there. Just take my word for it, son. It’ll be fine.”

“So, how was *your* day, Howard. Tell us about the new intern.”

Mom was quick to change the subject. Too quick. That all but confirmed it. There was something down there. Something they didn’t want me to find.

I swiftly finished my dinner and headed back up to my room with the excuse that I had a big exam to study for the next day. I locked the door and instantly returned to my gaming chair. I created a new save titled: *How? He has the key.*

I muddled through the ensuing school day, the Minecraft files at the forefront of my mind. What could my parents be so desperate to hide from me? And who was sending me those messages?

I gravitated toward my PC the minute I arrived home. I booted up Minecraft and… nothing. No new messages and no new save files. Strange. I decided to play it cool and wait. Maybe this really was just a joke and I’d fallen for it, hook, line, and sinker. Still, the thought that someone could be locked away just feet from where I sat gnawed at me like a piranha with a fresh kill. I had to know the truth.

Once my parents came home from work, they beelined to their room. That was odd. Dad usually sat in his favorite armchair, reading the newspaper, while Mom prepared dinner. The curiosity was killing me. I eavesdropped on their conversation, discarding my shoes prior so as not to make a sound.

“Howard, he knows. Why else would he be asking about the basement? He’s never taken any interest in it before.”

“Charlotte, he’s going through puberty. He’s going to start seeing the world in a different light. Questions like that are going to become more commonplace. We’ve been too careful. There’s no way he could’ve figured it out.”

“I know, I just can’t bear the thought of him going down there. He’d see us as monsters if he stumbled across that *thing.”*

Mom sobbed as Dad attempted to console her.

“Honey, that won’t happen. Even if he does suspect something, he won’t be able to find the key to get down there. I’ve got it taped under our dresser. He’d never think to look there in a million years.”

“You’re right. I just get so worked up thinking about it.”

“It’ll be okay. Just act normal and try to forget about it. He will too if we just leave it alone.”

That was all I needed to hear. I crept back to my room, careful to avoid any squeaky floorboards along the way. I sat on the edge of my bed, mulling over the conversation in my head. That thing? The key under the dresser? What were they hiding? I needed a plan.

I resolved to wait until my parents were asleep to enact my scheme. During dinner, I put on a facade in an attempt to soothe them into a surreptitious state of placidity regarding my suspicions. I noted that they seemed a bit on edge, but my outward upbeat demeanor, and lack of mention of the basement, reassured them that nothing was out of the ordinary. I set an alarm on my phone for two in the morning, when I was certain they would be fast asleep, and waited.

My alarm blared in my ears as I rushed to silence the racket. I slipped out of bed and tip-toed down the hallway. Every acute noise thundered in my ears like a gong. I hesitantly approached my parents’ bedroom door. Was I really going through with this? Maybe I could turn back. No. I had to know.

I inched the door open cautiously and dropped to the ground. I began to army crawl across the carpeted floor, praying that my parents wouldn’t catch me. In the dim light I could make out my objective. The dresser.

“Wha- what was that?” Dad groggily blustered.

My heart rate spiked and my stomach twisted itself into knots. Dad quickly lost interest and rolled over, immediately falling back asleep. His raucous snores affirmed in my mind that he hadn’t been fully awake. I pushed onward. I reached the dresser and shone my phone flashlight beneath it. There it was. I snatched the key and silently slithered out of my parents’ room.

I gazed at the rusted gold object in my hands. I’d never seen it before in my life. With a growing sense of determination, I made my way downstairs, meticulously evading every creaky step. I reached my destination. Shadows danced along the walls as I stared at the basement door. The soft light cast an eerie glow on its surface. I was really going through with this. My heart palpitated wildly in my chest as I inserted the key. It unlocked with a satisfying click. I peered into the darkness, rooted to the spot. I’d made it this far. There was no turning back now.

I crept down the cellar stairs, guided by the light from my phone screen. I fumbled in the darkness for the switch. I eventually grazed a string dangling from the ceiling. I pulled. What I saw still sends waves of panic through me.

Shackled to the wall, eyes wide as dinner plates, a teenage boy not much older than myself lay on a grimy mattress. He leaned up, his pupils begging me to help him escape. I stared at him slack jawed. So this is what they’d been hiding. My heart shattered for the boy. A cocktail of emotions surged through my system as I struggled to comprehend the scene before me.

“Please, you have to help me. I don’t know how long they’ve had me trapped down here.”

I anxiously shuffled over to him.

“How?”

“I think that key unlocks these,” he said, nodding to his restraints.

I stooped to release him, but not before soaking in his features. The boy was malnourished. He was deathly thin with scrawny brittle appendages. His face was ghastly white, piercing green eyes following my every move. Jet-black hair swept across his forehead, nearly obscuring his vision.

“Wait. Before I let you go, how were you able to communicate with me? And why are you down here?”

“Dad lets me use your room sometimes when you’re at school, if he works from home. Your computer is the only place he wouldn’t check for a hidden message.”

I stared blankly at him. *Dad*? I was frozen in shock.

“So, you’re my… brother?”

“I guess so. Look, we probably don’t have much time. Dad comes down here to feed me at night, and he hasn’t been down yet, so I really need to get out of here. I’ll try to fill you in later if I can.”

“Right,” I mumbled as I liberated him.

He gingerly rubbed his wrists where the chains had left deep purple scars. He thanked me profusely as we trudged up the stairs. Dread bubbled in my gut. Something about the boy felt off. Ingenuine. Like he was putting on an act. I crammed the notion to the back of my mind, chalking it up to nerves from being hidden away from the world for so long.

Once we reached the top step, I glanced over at him. He was scanning the dark room, head on a swivel. I placed a hand on his shoulder. He was ice cold to the touch. That’s normal for someone trapped in a cool basement, right?

“I’ll call the police and we can get you out of here. I can’t believe our parents would-”

“No. No cops.”

“What? Don’t you want some proper care? Or for our parents to pay for what they did to you all these years?”

“Oh, I’ll make them pay. You have my word on that. And I’ll be just fine on my own,” he said as he reached for the back door.

He walked off into the night, turning back only once. A wide nauseating smile plastered itself across his face. Unnaturally long pointed canines glimmered in the moonlight. A flash of red jolted across his corneas. Only then did I notice the two miniscule bite marks on his neck.

He sprinted off into the surrounding forest at an inhuman speed. And just like that, he was gone. I spun around to find Dad standing in the kitchen, staring in horror as the wind rattled through the back entrance. Even in the faint light I could see that he was ghostly pale, and he looked like he was going to pass out at any moment. He spoke, voice quaking with terror.

“You have no idea what you’ve just done.”
