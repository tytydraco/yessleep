I woke up the next morning with a bang.  Not that that went unexplained for too long.  It was the same one from my clock’s alarm, just like the morning before.  Still just as startling, though.  Stage Two had now officially begun.  I figured I didn’t really need to worry about the clock waking up my parents.  They hadn’t seemed to hear anything the day before when it went off just as loudly.  On Sunday, I was a bit worried about them asking about where the loud noise was coming from.  But by Monday morning, I figured if they hadn’t heard it the day before, they probably weren’t gonna hear it now.  Besides, they couldn’t seem to see the clock at all, and it made plenty of noise whenever The Sandman made his nightly visits, and they never complained about noise during all of those times either.

Speaking of The Sandman’s nightly visits, though, I was still gonna have to figure out how to sleep through those.  I knew it had to be possible.  I had watched Anastasia sleep through it like it was nothing.  Maybe if you’re asleep, The Sandman can’t wake you up.  Or maybe there’s some special sleeping technique I should know about.    Something or other to protect me from the noise so that I’m not woken up once I get to the point where, much like Anastasia, I’ll have to actually be asleep the whole time he’s there.  

As startling as the rude awakening was, it certainly did its job.  I was definitely up for the day.  Unlike most Monday Mornings, I actually had quite a bit of energy and seemed to have a bit more pep in my step.  Even though I hadn’t had the best sleep the night before, I was nevertheless feeling totally refreshed and ready to take on the day.  Well, as ready as anyone can be to take on a Monday.  

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I just could not seem to fall asleep with my head under my blanket.  I had never slept that way before, and I seemed to have a really tough time getting used to it.  So, naturally, despite turning in at 9, like Anastasia had told me to, I didn’t end up actually falling asleep until around 1.  And of course by then I had given up on trying to sleep with my head under the blanket.

Even though we still had a week to go before our project would be due, Anastasia and I had already made some pretty good progress.  Or at least she did.  Guess I probably shouldn’t really be taking credit for, well, most of that, if I’m being honest.  But either way, we were promisingly close to being done.  Which was great, because if we had a few spare days together in class with no school responsibilities, we could talk about Sleep Points some more.

I knew she had SAID that she only wanted us talking about that in private.  But on the two days we had worked together the previous week, it had always managed to come up.  So, I still had a pretty decent amount of hope that we could get somewhere together, even if it did have to be during class.  Our meetings at her house were always so short.  If those meeting at her place were really going to be the only time we could talk about it, then it was going to take some serious time to get any meaningful amount of information.  But then again, I’m guessing that’s probably exactly what Anastasia would’ve wanted, anyway.

She only ever had about an hour in between Sandman visits, from what I could gather.  Not that she was especially keen to talk about all of that.  She still seemed to think that I was completely unaware of how The Sandman was escaping her clock at 2 and 3 AM on weekends.  I figured it must’ve been pretty normal for The Sandman to show up once an hour on the hour in Anastasia’s case.  If it wasn’t, she probably would’ve picked a better time of night, when The Sandman was less liable to turn up.  For example, if 3 AM was the last time the Sandman came, she probably would’ve had me come at 3:05 AM instead.  But I’m guessing that it’d be no use.  The Sandman probably turns up at 4 AM as well for her.  I had no idea when I was going to reach the stage she was on, however.  I could only hope that it was a long ways away.  Luckily I was right.  But by now, time has already caught up with me.

But anyway, between the five minutes she would always spend getting herself up and out to meet at the back door and the ten minutes she would always need to get back to sleep, it only gave us about 45 minutes per visit.  And that was only twice a week.  Just 90 minutes per week in total.  I would be going nowhere like that.  Not only was it nowhere near enough already, but at the same time, we would waste time bickering like an old married couple about all sorts of petty bullshit, just like we did Saturday night.  That just meant that what little time we actually WOULD have together would get thrown out as well.  

Not that that even seemed like it was my fault.  Or at least, not for the most part.  SHE was the one who decided to give me a whole entire lecture about how it was wrong of me to have NOT stolen my parents’ truck.  Given the events that had taken place on the night before that, I had every reason to believe that I was putting my dad’s truck at serious risk of being completely totaled.  I mean, you tell me: can you honestly blame me?

I thought more about what she had said when I was just about to leave that night.  She referenced how she didn’t want to find out about me getting lost on my way back again.  I still didn’t understand how she could’ve known that.  That is, without invoking Sleep Points.  Hopefully, this was a clue about what I could use Sleep Points on, even if Anastasia wasn’t gonna outright tell me herself.  Maybe she turned some in and exchanged them for information about me.  The only problem was, I didn’t know where you had to go in the app if you wanted to exchange them for something.  As always, no matter what I did when I opened the app, I got a big number in the center, and nothing else but a white background.

I probably wasn’t supposed to have seen The Sandman making his way out of her clock at 2 AM that previous Saturday morning.  But then again, it wasn’t like she ever did a good job of hiding it when The Sandman looked like he was about let loose all over again by 3 AM either.  But still.  Knowing, in your mind, that something happened and watching it all unfold before you are two very different things.  Even if she didn’t care that I knew about how The Sandman showed up in her room at 2 AM on a Friday night, she’d probably still lose her shit over the wrecklessness of what I did by peering in through her window and looking at her clock and watching the whole ordeal unfold, if she ever found out about it.  But then again, if she had known about how I had gotten lost on my way back home, maybe she would have her ways of knowing about the whole situation involving me peering in through her window as well, and she had just sitting been on it the whole time.  I honestly didn’t know.

When sixth period finally arrived, all the hope I had had about getting to talk to Anastasia about Sleep Points was pretty quickly crushed.  It had started out good.  At first, I thought that was where the conversation was going.  But then she just kinda left me hangin’.

“How did you sleep?” She asked.

“Not great.  Only about 5 hours, maybe.  Not terrible, though.” I responded simply.

“Out or under?” She asked, this time, in a somewhat more hushed voice.

“I mean obviously I slept under my blanket.  Do you mean, like, my head too?”  I asked, figuring that was what she must’ve meant by that question.

“Yes.” She responded.

“Out still.  I tried sleeping with my head under, though.  Once I gave up on trying to sleep with my head under the blanket at around 1, I spent the rest of the night sleeping fine,” I told her.

“You will not be fine for much longer,” she said.  “Upon commencing Stage 3, which will start in four weeks’ time, mind you, you will be required to be asleep during the second arrival at 5 AM,” she explained, still in the same hushed tone as before.  

So that was great.  I had four more weeks until The Sandman was gonna show up again, twice in one night, now at 5 AM too.  And on top of everything else, I was gonna have to be asleep through the whole thing.  Even though it kept on being impossible for me to drift off without having my head outside the blankets, thus far.  

I knew the time was eventually gonna come, where I would have to be asleep with my entire body under the blanket, head and all, when The Sandman came, all while being fast asleep.  But I had no idea of the timetable.  I had thought for sure that I would have months until I had to seriously worry about it.  Instead, I had only 4 lousy weeks to get used to it.

The fact that I was having so much trouble falling asleep with my head under my blanket was the whole reason why I kept on having to stay up past midnight every night, after all.  If I could just fall asleep with my head already underneath my blanket, I could go to sleep before midnight just fine.  But as things stood then, going to sleep before midnight would mean doing it with my head completely exposed to The Sandman once midnight rolled around.  And that was basically a death sentence.

For a moment, I was seriously beginning to question if I even WANTED to get back to the topic of Sleep Points with her.  Our last meeting was so dramatic.  And since I wasn’t giving her the answers she wanted to hear, it looked like we were about to get started on the wrong foot all over again.

Not that it mattered.  Just as soon as she brought up how I was sleeping, she dropped the subject completely.  She got right back to work on our project.  At the rate she was going, we were pretty much guaranteed to be done by the end of class the next day.  Maybe even by the end of class that same day.  I tried to bring up Sleep Points again, along with my question about what a person could actually DO with them, since I already had some ideas floating around my brain that I was hoping she could confirm.  Maybe there were all kinds of qualities Sleep Points had that I had never even thought of.  Maybe she could tell me all about those while she was at it.

“So, what exactly do they do for you?” I said, trying not to reference Sleep Points directly.  Not even just because I was concerned about Anastasia chastising me about bringing it up in public.  I was afraid to do that already, regardless of how she reacted.  Something told me that I probably shouldn’t be letting outsiders know anything.  And by “something” I mean a real gut feeling, even beyond anything Anastasia had told me up until then.  Obviously, SHE had told me not to let outsiders know anything.  But even without all of that, I still a bad feeling about it that I just couldn’t shake.

“What exactly does what do for me?  What specifically do you mean by ‘they’?” she asked, very clearly trying to come off as oblivious.  I supposed that must’ve been her way of telling me not to talk about it anymore.  We had already risked enough talking as much as we did just during that 6th period alone, what with all our talk about "out or under" and "Stage Three" and everything.

But I continued to press the subject.  “Uh… y’know?   SP?” I said.  After all we had been through together, she had to know what that meant, even if nobody else did.

“I do not know to what you are referring.  We have much work to do.  Since the whole class has made such promising progress on the project, Mr. Brigham has pushed up the due date to this Thursday, the 28th of February, if you have not already taken notice,” she said.  

“What are you talking about?” I asked, out of genuine curiosity.  I checked the whiteboard at the front of the library.  Sure enough, Mr. Brigham had written in it, saying that our project was now due on Thursday, instead of next Monday.  

“Oh. Yeah.” I said kinda stupidly.  Trying to save the moment while not looking like too much of an idiot, I decided to continue.  “Well still, I could hardly see that on the whiteboard from here.  I mean c’mon.  He just cut off four days from our deadline, just like that.  You’d think he would’ve given it, I dunno, maybe a little more fanfare?” I chuckled.  “I mean seriously.  The man could’ve at least given an announcement or something,” I said, trying to lighten the mood a little by taking some shots at the teacher while also low-key trying to flirt some by being funny.  We obviously weren’t gonna be talking about more pressing matters, so I figured "hey, why they hell not shoot my shot", right?

“He did,” she said blankly.  “Mr. Brigham made an announcement right at the beginning of class. That is why I was somewhat confused momentarily as to why you did not already know.” She continued.  “Mr. Brigham drew a great deal of attention to it.  The only reason you were unaware of this recent development is due to the fact that you were simply inobservant.  As I often find you to be, Morgan,” she finished.

Well, there went that.  I was really hoping we could move past our problems.  But there I had to go again, giving her yet another reason to criticize me.  Instead of getting her to think I was funny, there I went, making her think I was a fucking idiot, as always.

While I was still thinking of it, I figured the fact that I wasn’t exactly doing much to help with the whole Food Chain Project thing probably wasn’t helping my case either.  So I figured the least I could do was apologize for that.  “Look, I’m really sorry about how I haven’t done much to help with the whole project and everything,” I told her.  “I just don’t know what I’m doing here,” I finished.

“I am aware of that,” she replied, coldly.

“Yeah… so… if you could maybe like, point me in the right direction, I guess?  Look, if I know what I’m doing, I promise I’ll help.” I said, a bit desperately, for at least some degree of affirmation from her.

“Do not concern yourself with the project.  I would hate for your influence to corrupt my efforts.  I suspect your endeavors would be greatly counter-productive,” she said, pretty rudely, I gotta say.

“Aight.  Suit yourself,” I responded, in a pretty pissed-off sorta way.  “Bitch”, I muttered to myself.

Well damn.  Okay, then.  Guess I didn’t need to feel bad for not helping after all.  But that still sucked.  I was hoping I would get the chance to help her and maybe show off my intellectual side a little bit. Since Anastasia always does so well in school, I thought that if I could just pull off that, maybe I could impress her.

At the beginning of the project, I was hoping I would be at the helm of the whole operation.  That SHE would be the one needing MY help.  And that she would perceive me all the better for it.  Or at least that she would value whatever help I could provide if nothing else.  But not only did she not value, let alone NEED, my help, now she was just glad I wasn’t getting in her way.

“Y’know, I’m only trying to help however I can.  I dunno why you have to be such a bitch about it,” I said.

Anastasia let out a sigh.  “I suppose my heightened irritability is somewhat of a self-inflicted wound.  Ever since I lent you my blanket, I have slept exceptionally poorly.  Though I did not bring this upon myself entirely.  Had you arrived less ill-equipped to cope with the cold weather, I would have had no need to lend it to you,” she explained.  “If you wish to be of assistance, give it back.  I specifically told you to return it to me when next we convened.  Do you have it with you?” she asked.

“Well… I thought you just meant like the next time I came to your house.  And I was totally ready to give it back then,” I said, defensively.

“Are we not convening right at this precise moment?  Why should our meetings in class fail to qualify as ‘convening’?” she questioned.  I didn’t have a good answer for that.  I probably should’ve known that I should’ve brought it with me to school.  She was, after all, pretty clear on how she wanted it back as soon as possible.  Of course, she still had plenty of other blankets to sleep under.  That was the whole reason why she had even made it to school alive that day, without becoming a victim to The Sandman.  But still, the thin woven blanket she gave me clearly helped her sleep better than any of the rest, based on what she was saying about how she’d slept so badly without it.

“I… don’t know,” I admitted.

“Have it with you tomorrow.  I do not wish to ask you again,” she said, with a definite note of fury in her voice, now.  She didn’t raise her voice, but you could always tell she was mad by the way she spoke.  Anastasia was never the type who needed to yell or raise her voice to get the point across.  She always had quite the uncanny ability to maintain her usual soft and proper tone of voice all while still undeniably sounding as though she would not hesitate to kill you in your sleep.

Anyway, I left her to it and just stayed out of her work, not messing any of it up since, apparently, that was all I would’ve been capable of accomplishing, according to her.  Then the bell rang, and we went to 7th period.  And then, after that, soon enough it would be time to head back home on the bus.  And just when I thought my day couldn’t get any worse, guess who I see?  Well, no, it actually wasn’t Ezra this time around, thank god.  But an unwelcome face, nonetheless.

It was Truman.  Oh great.  How would he be getting me into trouble now?  Well, as it turned out, he wasn’t interested in getting me into any trouble.  Turned out he wasn’t back for round 2 of kicking the ever-loving shit out of me after all.  
He had actually seemed quite a bit more subdued than I had normally seen him.

 Of course, he still tried, just as hard as ever, to maintain his usual superficial level of coolness and swagger.  But I could still tell he wasn’t in any mood to lord over me like he normally would on the rare occasions when we crossed paths these days.  Ever since he had broken up with Anastasia, he hadn’t really been himself.

For a moment, I had even considered the possibility that maybe he was looking to me for advice on how to get back together with her.  Maybe he had heard about how I had been working with Anastasia in Environmental Science.  We had, after all, been spending more time together at school than ever before lately.  Not that that was a very high bar.  All that really meant was that we were spending literally any amount of time at all together.  Before we had gotten paired up on the Environmental Science Project, we had barely spoken to one another.

But anyway, as it turned out, Truman hadn't come to talk to me about Anastasia at all.  As his somewhat nervous and shaky approach had alluded to, this was about something he was afraid of.  Sleep Points, of course.  He had managed to get himself roped into it too.  All thanks to yours truly.  Which, needless to say, could not have made him especially pleased with me.  But since I was the only person he knew who could tell him anything, he still needed my help.  He needed to put his usual bullying ways aside

“Ay, yo, uh Stanley”, he said, trying to maintain his cool.  And, I guess to his credit, he still mostly had, at least up to that point.  The mask would, of course, start to slip as the conversation went on.

“Yeah?” I responded.

“So uh, yeah.  ‘Bout that note that ya told me about,” He started.

“Yeah?” I responded again.  I of course knew exactly what he was talking about.  But I still wanted to make him awkwardly explain his situation to me.  Just like what I had to do with him about a week and a half or so prior to.  
By now, realizing he was gonna have to go into specifics, he did, finally, start to properly crack.

“Y’know, since you had brought it up to me I decided to, uh, investigate a little, right?” he said.

“Okay,” I responded, blankly.

“Yeah, yeah, so uh… listen.  Ya ever try to do any investigatin’ yourself, y’know?  Like, about that note?” He asked, getting more flustered by the moment.

“Why?” I asked.

“So, like, you mean you didn’t?” He asked.

“I just wanted to know why you had asked.” I stated simply.

“So you did?” He asked, more brightly now.  “I mean, ya didn’t say ‘no’.”

“Maybe”, I said, trying to be coy.  Course, it didn’t work.  Even Truman could see right through it.

“Ha ha, alright, cool, cool.  Did your own research too, eh?” he said, almost seeming as though he was trying to come off as friendly, a way he had never acted with me before.

“Why do you care?” I asked, trying to get him to just cut to chase already.

“Ya got one of those clocks in your room too, huh?” He said.

“Yep.  Every night at midnight,” I said.  And of course, that was all I needed to say.  Truman may not have been the brightest, but since we somehow managed to have that insane experience in common, he could immediately pick up what I was putting down.

“You know how to kill the asshole?” He asked.  “I figured I’d just break the clock, but the damn thing fixes itself by morning.  No use.  Didn’t bother tryin’,” he said.  Which, to his credit, was a good idea.  I’m guessing he had no intention of dying a slow, terrible, and sleepless death.  Because that is exactly what he would be faced with if he actually tried breaking the thing.  Not that he knew about any of that, though.

“I gotta catch my bus.” I said, since, after all, my bus really was leaving pretty soon.  

Then I got home and did my homework.  After the exchange that had happened between me and my Environmental Science Partner earlier that day, I didn’t feel so bad about not addressing the big project that was now due in three days, after I had gotten done with all my other schoolwork.

After that, the day seemed to go on as normal.  I played Minecraft on my laptop along with the new Kingdom Hearts III that my mom and dad had gotten me for the switch.  

While I was playing, I noticed that I still had a small pang of guilt over the game that my parents had given me, since I knew I didn’t really deserve it.   
 I hadn’t felt guilty about that in quite a while since, honestly, I just hadn’t thought about it in a while either.  They got me the game and that was that.  Fair and square or not, the purchase was made.  Even if I did fess up, mom and dad would probably be happy enough with my honesty to just let me keep it anyhow.  So what was the point?  What was the use in working myself up over this?

And then I started thinking about how, if there was really anything for me to feel guilty about, it was stealing my parents’ truck.  And almost having gotten it totaled at that, what with the brush with death I had Saturday morning before dawn.  Once that, much more relevant, reason to feel guilty entered my mind, I had a tough time getting it out.  

But then I remembered the conversation I had with Ezra at church the day before.  The one about whether or not what I thought I had seen had truly been real.  Yeah, I did take their truck, but it wasn’t really as if I had almost gotten it totally ruined, even if there really was another truck that came toward me that night.  Maybe I almost got it towed, but not ruined completely.  The truck approaching mine could only go so fast in all the snow.  The impact couldn’t possibly have been too overwhelmingly destructive, even if it did end up happening.  

But still, if I was so tired to the point where I was hallucinating as badly as Ezra seemed to think, I could’ve still done some pretty serious damage behind the wheel.  I already pretty much knew that it couldn’t have been him back there.  He was a few hundred miles away in Anchorage when it all went down.  That ruled him out entirely.

But even then, if there was REALLY anything to feel guilty about, it was telling Truman about the post-it note.  It’s because of me that he ever started playing Sleep Points in the first place.  If I had never told him about the note, I bet he would’ve never messed with it.

But then the thoughts of guilt started getting replaced with thoughts of depression.  Depression about how Anastasia had completely barred me from helping out on our project because I would only get in the way.  Because I was too incompetent to actually add something of value to what she was doing.  And the worst part was how she was totally right.  

I tried researching the subject, I honestly did.  I looked up everything I could about the food chain in the Florida Everglades.  But I just couldn’t find anything that seemed important to the project.  Or at least, nothing that Anastasia hadn’t already written about at length already.  Sure, I had found a few factoids about the food chain of a wetland.  But it was all barebones bullshit that Anastasia had already written down in full detail days ago.  So, while I did still find plenty of stuff while researching, it’s not like it did the group a whole lotta good since my partner was already way ahead of me.

And then the depression turned into anger.  Okay, sure, so maybe nothing I found actually added anything of value.  But it’s not as if it took anything away.  I get it.  I fucked up my trip to her place.  But did that really mean that now, all of a sudden, I was a liability even with school projects?  I mean what did one thing honestly have to do with the other?  Why would refusing to drive over in my dad’s truck somehow mean that I would be completely catastrophic to a school project?  If I was really so much of a dipshit that I would find a way to counteract all of Anastasia’s progress, why was she still expecting me to pull off trips to her house in the dead of night every weekend?

Soon enough, it was 8 o’clock, and I had to turn off all my electronics if I didn’t want Anastasia to read me the riot act when we met up at school the next day.  I was almost glad she was so insistent about getting me into a bedtime routine since my shower really helped clear my head and stopped me from spiraling.  If she hadn’t been making me take a shower every night, I probably wouldn’t have taken one just then.

After I had brushed my teeth and flossed, there was still about half an hour left before 9 o’clock.  Since I didn’t have any screens to entertain me, I just poked around my room, looking for anything else to pique my interest.  Soon enough, 9 o’clock came, and I hopped into bed, trying once again to fall asleep with my head under my blanket.  

A whole mishmash of unpleasant thoughts was festering in my mind as I tried to fall asleep.  My brain was still whizzing with anxious and depressive thoughts.  This was all making it pretty tough to sleep.  Part of what made falling asleep with my head under the blanket so difficult was the fact that I had a really thick blanket.  One that didn’t seem like it was gonna let a whole lotta air in.  What I really needed, was one of those light blankets, like the one Anastasia used.  But then I remembered I did.  She had sent me home with it.

I was just about to peak my head out from under my quilt and go looking for Anastasia's blanket when I almost jolted, just before I exposed the crown of my head to the outside world.  It was already midnight and the glass had just broken.  If I wasn’t scared stiff, I would’ve flinched.  Then The Sandman know that I had just moved under there.  But fortunately for me, my body just kinda froze.

I was expecting all the same horrific sounds that usually came at midnight, but that night I heard something I had never heard before: The Sandman spoke.

“Not asleep”. It said in a malicious ghost-like voice.  It was like a chorus of terrifying voices straight from the depths of hell speaking in unholy harmony.  I thought I was done.  The Sandman knew I wasn’t asleep.  Oh sure, Anastasia had told me all about how The Sandman knew if I was really asleep or not, and that, for now, it was just checking to make sure I was completely covered by my blanket and lying perfectly still.   

But The Sandman had never, itself, brought up the fact that it could tell I wasn’t asleep.  The Sandman had never spoken at all up until then.  What did this mean?  Had I moved and not realized it?  What followed was total, complete, and honestly quite disturbing silence for what felt like forever.  Even the usual hell-sirens associated with The Sandman’s arrival would’ve been welcome.  Just something, anything, to break the suffocating quiet.

“54 hours to go,” said The Sandman, in the same hauntingly uncanny and hateful voice as before, then disappearing back into the clock as usual, restoring the glass it just broke out of all over again.  I checked my phone.  Sure enough, there it was.  A big 160.  Up by 20 from the 140 it had displayed from the day before.  

Now that the coast was clear, I searched around my room for Anastasia’s blanket.  For a moment, I was worried that I had forgotten what I had done with it, and that I might’ve accidentally lost it.  And if I had, I already knew that there was no way I could ever face Anastasia again.  She might genuinely murder me.

After another 10 or 15 minutes though, I thankfully found it.  I figured her blanket would be the key to my success in falling asleep.  Given how much grief it gave Anastasia to go to sleep without her blanket, I figured that meant I would be out like a light underneath that thing.

But then I started second-guessing that plan.  After all, she did say that the blanket had special powers.  Would she really want me using them?  Then I remembered that I had already used the blanket’s powers to make my home without freezing to death.  It couldn’t hurt to try.  But what if every time I used it, I somehow drained it of power or something?  I had to keep in mind that Anastasia had specifically told me I could use it for my walk home.  That was the whole reason she had ever lent it to me at all.  

She was always so particular about what she wanted me to do.  If she hadn’t given me any direct orders to use it to go to sleep, that probably meant I shouldn’t.  And if she knew about how I got lost, if she knew about whether or not I was going along with her recommended bedtime routine, that probably meant she could tell if I used her blanket to go to sleep.  It didn’t really seem like there was anything I get past her.  She already seemed royally pissed off that I hadn’t given the blanket back to her at school.  I was in no position to risk upsetting her even further.

After abandoning my plan to sleep under Anastasia’s blanket, I tried going to sleep just as I normally would.  Except, I still couldn’t sleep.  Not only were all my disruptive thoughts amplifying, but even without them, I just wasn’t feeling tired.  I just wasn’t feeling comfortable.  I figured maybe I was too hot.  Maybe my thick blanket was overkill, and I needed some cool air.  So I decided to turn my fan on anyway, even though I wouldn’t need it to circulate air in and out of my blanket anymore, now that I was sleeping with my head outside the covers.  I figured what I really needed was to cool down.

But that didn’t work either.  If anything, it was even worse than before.  My face was getting irritated from all the air blowing into it from the fan.  So then I decided I may as well take another stab at sleeping with my head under the blanket.    
It’s always tough getting used to sleeping in a way that you’re just not used to.  Whether it actually cut off my air or not, I just couldn’t get used to the position of sleeping with my head under the covers and got the sense that I probably never would.  Or at least, not for the near future.

So, I gave up on that and just turned the fan off.  And then everything got suddenly quiet.  I hadn’t realized how acclimated I had gotten to the sound of the fan.  When I made the decision to turn it off, I had still felt as though I hadn’t gotten used to the noise and wouldn’t be able to sleep with it on.

But the silence didn’t feel any better.  Now, with the total silence of the fan being turned off and the total darkness that surrounded me now that the light from the clock was gone given that The Sandman had already came and went, I was starting to get nervous.  

I was never one to be afraid of the dark, but the darkness I was experiencing felt different.  I was totally used to my room being pitch black in the dead of night.  And yet this darkness still felt darker, somehow.  It just had a real ominous vibe to it, and that’s pretty much the best way I can describe it.  As I stared into the blackness filling my room to the brim, I couldn’t help but feel an intense sense of foreboding.

“Alright, so I’m having trouble sleeping, but that doesn’t matter too much”, I had told myself.  “I’ve had trouble sleeping after The Sandman’s visits plenty of times before”, I thought to myself reassuringly.  However, all the times that I DID struggle to sleep after one of The Sandman’s visits, it had almost always been in the wake of one of his first appearances.  After I had grown accustomed to his nightly visits, as scared as I still was, once he was gone, I could usually go to sleep pretty easily since, by then, I knew that I wouldn’t be seeing him again until that time tomorrow night.

In any case, I still wasn’t too worried about my trouble sleeping, regardless of what Anastasia had said about Stage 2 and how hard it was gonna be to sleep from now on.  It was only 1 AM, and honestly it still wasn’t that uncommon for me to not yet be tired, even by that point.  But then the hours started ticking past.  Slowly but surely, 1:30 came.  And then it was 2.  By quarter to three I was still just as wide awake as I had been 2 hours ago. It was at around that point that I started to get more seriously concerned. Why wasn’t I getting tired?  

I knew I had a lot on mind.  I knew I had my reasons for keeping myself up.  But even then, it felt like none of that mattered.  Even if I somehow managed to successfully block out all of it, even if I had nothing at all keeping me up, I just couldn’t seem to get tired.  By the time 4 AM came, I knew I would need to get up in 2 and a half hours.  At that point, in the interest of getting at least SOME amount of sleep, I decided to do something that I hated doing: exercise.

 Yeah, yeah, I get it.  Laugh it up about how the out-of-shape kid doesn’t wanna exercise.  Whatever.  But I'm bringing it up to show desperate I was getting to get even the smallest amount of sleep.  I tried sit ups, wall-sits, jumping-jacks, hell, even some pushups.

By the end of it all I was definitely winded, and very weary.  But weary is not the same as sleepy.  As much as I wanted to lay down and relax, sleep still didn’t feel any closer to coming around.

Eventually, it was 5:30 and I had to accept that I wasn’t going to be sleeping.  Maybe I could, in theory, still get half an hour or 45 minutes.  But that wouldn’t be enough to stave off The Sandman.  I needed 90 minutes of continuous sleep by 6 AM on Thursday, and by that point, it was totally out of the question for that night.

Since I had no hope of getting any sleep before the clock’s alarm would go off at 6, I decided to just turn it off.  Technically I set the alarm for midnight.  But the alarm never goes off at midnight.  I’m guessing if you set the alarm for any time when The Sandman arrives, the alarm just doesn’t work in that case.  Which I guess makes sense in a way.  The clock probably can’t do its job while The Sandman is bursting out of it and everything.  After I got rid of the alarm, I laid back down and prepared to face the day running on no sleep at all.
