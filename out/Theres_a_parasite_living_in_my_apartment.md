Have you ever had to deal with a pantry moth infestation? If so, then you know just how irritating and disgusting it can be. Tossing out food all the time, even stuff you just opened, scrubbing every inch of the kitchen like a maniac, and having to move everything into vacuum-sealed containers. And then, just when you think it’s finally over, you open a jar of oatmeal only to find that those little bastards somehow got in, laid their eggs, and now you’ve got larvae in your breakfast. And the whole cycle begins again.

That’s the state I’d been living in for a few months, at the time when everything started.

After countless failed attempts to get rid of them, I had finally decided to get some traps. Yeah, I should have done it much earlier but, to be honest, I was feeling quite hesitant about it. You see, for as long as I can remember I’ve always had a strong sensitivity toward animals – and, for four years now, I’ve been vegan. Because of this, even the thought of killing those tiny pests made me feel really uneasy. I’m well aware of how people see vegans, especially online, and I’m sure some of you are already rolling your eyes and thinking I’m some crazy extremist. That’s fine, I’m used to it. And no, I’m not trying to “convert” anyone. It’s just a personal decision based on my own moral compass.

If anyone reading this is also vegan or vegetarian, I’m sure you’re familiar with the kind of “ethical dilemmas” people love to throw at us when they hear about our diet. Stuff like: “If you were on a desert island with only chickens and pigs, would you eat them to survive?” or “Would you kill an animal if it was attacking you and your family?” – always asked with a satisfied grim, as if it’s some kind of clever ‘gotcha’ moment.

Well, my situation with the pantry moths had turned into something like that. It was no longer just a matter of hygiene or food waste – it had become a matter of survival: either me or them.

So, on my next trip to the supermarket, I filled my basket with those sticky traps that you attach to cupboard doors. That weekend, I committed myself to a full-on cleaning operation. I completely emptied the kitchen shelves, threw away all the food they contained, and even went as far as replacing every single glass container. I vacuumed and washed every shelf, and placed a couple of traps in each cabinet, hoping this would finally put an end to the whole ordeal.

And for a while, it seemed like it had. I wasn’t exactly thrilled to see dead moths stuck to the cabinet doors, but at least I felt a huge sense of relief.

Then, one morning, I found it.

I was just reaching for the sugar for my coffee when I saw it, stuck to one of the traps. At first, I flinched, thinking it was a centipede or some other creepy bug. Then, looking closer, I realized it was something else.

It was about 4 inches long and looked like a piece of fabric, although incredibly thin. It reminded me of the shed skin of a snake, almost transparent, but with faint brown streaks, more similar in color to the moths themselves. There was something deeply unsettling about it. I didn’t know what it was, but the idea that it had come from some weird insect still lurking somewhere in my kitchen made my skin crawl.

At that moment, I – a grown man, nearly thirty years old – found myself wishing I still lived with my parents, that I could just call for my dad and ask him to deal with whatever that thing was. 

Yeah, feel free to laugh about me – scared by a piece of cloth.

I must admit that I felt ridiculous myself, once I really thought about it. Still, I wasn’t completely ready to handle that thing, at least not before understanding what it was.

I turned to Google, but the research turned out quite unsuccessful. At the very least, the fact that no other insect or parasite seemed to match the description of what I had found made me feel much better, and I concluded that there was nothing to worry about.

Doing my best to suppress my gag reflex, I armed myself with some paper towels, managed to remove the trap from the wall and threw it in the trash, replacing it with a new one.

In the days that followed, I never came across anything like that again and, eventually, I ended up completely forgetting about it. At the same time, however, the moth problem—which I thought was over—started getting worse again.

I was seeing them outside the kitchen now. Sometimes a couple would show up on the bathroom walls, in the living room, even in the bedroom. Although many ended up stuck to the traps, their numbers never seemed to shrink. And no matter how often I checked and obsessively cleaned the cupboards, I just couldn’t figure out where they were coming from.

Of course, my discomfort was deeper than ever. I had nearly stopped purchasing dry goods altogether and, in general, made an effort to spend as little time in the kitchen as possible. Most of my meals now consisted of frozen food or takeaway.

It was starting to take a toll on my mental health too. Seeing them crawling on the walls and ceiling would fill me with a sense of overwhelming unease. When the apartment was completely still, especially at night, it felt almost as if I could hear them squirming in the food, chewing through cardboard and wood, sneaking into every crack and corner. Even the tiniest brush against my skin would make me jump.

To the feeling of disgust and revulsion toward the pests, a sense of paranoia had also begun to creep in—one far worse than anything I’d experienced before. This, though, wasn’t due solely to the moths themselves, but rather to other strange events that, at that same time, had begun occurring in my apartment.

I’ll try to recount everything that happened as clearly and logically as I can.

It started with the smell. A sickly-sweet odor, but, at first, barely noticeable. I would catch it now and then, drifting through the air as I moved from one room to another, or when I came home after a day at work. Unable to determine exactly where it was coming from, I first checked the fridge, the trash, the kitchen floor corners under the furniture and the area around the dining table, places where food might have fallen and spoiled. I even looked behind the couch, under the rug, beneath the bed, and around the nightstands—even though I never really eat in the bedroom. Although I found nothing, the smell, in those spots, seemed to intensify slightly. So, I decided to wash the couch cushions and covers, the rug, and the bed linens, but nothing changed. I checked the bathroom too, and the walls that housed the plumbing, searching for signs of leaks or mold.

Still nothing.

A few weeks later, I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling thirsty. I automatically reached for the glass of water on my nightstand. I have this habit of filling one before going to bed, keeping it next to the bed to avoid getting up at moments like this. But then, holding it in front of me in the room dimly lit by the moonlight, I noticed the glass was half empty. Under normal circumstances, being thirsty and still half asleep, I wouldn’t have even registered it. Yet, I hesitated.

I focused, trying to recall if I had taken a sip earlier that night or just before falling asleep.

Maybe I had spilled some while setting it down. Or maybe I had simply filled it only halfway.

Yes, that must have been it. Still, despite my efforts to ease my mind, something prevented me from taking a sip. The thought, weird and irrational as it was, that someone else might have drunk from the glass, had already crawled into in my head.

I stayed perfectly still, holding my breath, ears straining to catch the faintest sound in the apartment – a creaking floorboard, a door handle turning, a quiet breath.

But everything was silent.

I mean, sure, there are some weird people out there. But why would someone sneak into my apartment just to take a sip of water, inches from my face, risking being caught if I woke up?

Besides, my place is pretty safe. I live on the fourth floor, so breaking in through a window was nearly impossible, and the front door, which I always lock before bed, can’t be opened from the outside without a key.

And yet, I couldn’t shake the unease. I got up, still holding the half empty glass, and decided to check every room.

As expected, nothing was out of place. The door was locked. Everything looked normal.

Finally, I made my way to the kitchen. When I turned on the light, I noticed the moths again.

A few dotted the pantry walls, but many more clustered on the ceiling. At least, I thought, it couldn’t have been the moths who drank my water.

Then again, they could still fall in, floating there, dead, until I, distracted, take a sip and...

I couldn’t help but grimace in disgust.

Why the hell was I even thinking about this?

Well, because those damn pests were everywhere – on my plates, in my glasses, in my food.

I washed the glass twice before filling it with water again and going back to bed.

The glass thing happened again, just a few days later. I woke up one morning and found it nearly empty.

But this time, I was sure I hadn’t drunk from it and there was no brushing it off.

Especially because the day before, I had started noticing the stains.

Brown smears—irregular, shifting in shape—like something rancid had been dragged across the surfaces.

The smell was the same one that had been hanging in the air for weeks, only now stronger, denser, harder to ignore. And the moths, they loved it. They were attracted to it, just like with the sticky traps.

The stains showed up in the weirdest places: on some of my clothes, on the glass panel in the shower, on the bookshelves, on the back of the couch—whose cover I had just had professionally cleaned.

It didn’t look like mold, but I was sure it was something like it.

Something organic. Something toxic, that was slowly spreading.

And I couldn’t stop it.

It didn’t matter that I threw away my clothes, tossed the sofa, scrubbed every surface with disinfectant, got rid of food, rags, sponges. They kept coming back.

And I couldn’t find any explanation.

I scoured the internet. I contacted professionals, pest control, cleaning companies. But no one had a clean answer and nothing seemed to fix the problem.

By now, you’re probably asking yourself why I didn’t just leave.

Truth is, I asked myself the same thing, many times.

Every single day, I dreaded the moment I’d walk back into that apartment after work.

The nauseating stench waiting just beyond the door.

Another fresh stain somewhere in the house, covered with writhing moths.

Sometimes, when I couldn’t take it anymore, I’d check into some cheap hotel for the night.

But I always came back.

Something inside me pulled harder than the fear, harder than the repulsion.

A force—no, an obsession—that wouldn’t let go until I uncovered the truth of what was happening in that place.

You see, there’s another detail I haven’t mentioned yet. Sometimes I would step into a room and immediately feel like I was being watched. Then, I would carefully scan every corner, every single object around me.

Even though I never managed to find anything, my mind seemed to register something off, something wrong.

You’ve probably experienced it too: walking into a familiar room and feeling like something is different, without being able to tell exactly what. Maybe an item that has been misplaced or something you seem to notice for the first time, though now you’re unsure if it’s always been there.

That was exactly the feeling I had in those moments.

I knew something had changed, something subtle, but I could never figure out what.

And then, after a few seconds, the sensation would disappear, along with the feeling of being watched.

It was driving me insane.

I know what you’re probably thinking:

“So what? That’s still not a good enough reason to not get the fuck out.”

And yeah, looking back, I can see now that you’re absolutely right. As I write these words, it even sounds to me like I’m describing some idiot willing to risk a home invasion or a biohazard just to satisfy a stupid curiosity.

But you have to understand: during those weeks, my mental state was far from stable.

I could barely sleep, constantly weighed down by anxiety and paranoia.

And when I did manage to fall asleep – usually with the help of a pill – it was a restless sleep, haunted by nightmares. I’d dream of waking up covered in that rancid slime, with moths and larvae crawling all over me, burrowing into every opening they could find, consuming me from the inside, hollowing me out.

In the daytime, it was no better.

I’d move frantically from room to room, turning over furniture, searching without rest.

Other times, I’d just sit there in silence for hours, watching, memorizing every detail, trying hard not to blink, not to miss it.

But that thing – whatever it was – always managed to stay just out of sight.

Until one night, I saw it.

I’d just opened my eyes, unsure if I’d ever actually fallen asleep.

And there it was.

On the wall, just above the bookshelf.

Though I could barely make it out in the darkness, its shape resembled that of a man. And yet, that thing couldn't possibly have been human.

It was thin—almost like a paper cut-out of a man, cut and crookedly glued to the wall.

Its head was slightly lifted, and it seemed to sway gently, moved by the breeze slipping through the cracked window.

Completely overtaken by shock and terror, I laid in bed, petrified. At the same time, though, I felt an urge rising inside of me. I wanted to see. I wanted to know.

Every muscle in my body was tense as I slowly, as quietly as possible, slid my arm out from under the blanket, reaching for the lamp switch on my nightstand.

When I finally felt it beneath my fingers, I waited a few seconds, uncertain, doubting whether I was truly ready to face whatever was there.

Then, holding my breath, I clicked it on.

I barely had time to catch a glimpse before it, startled by the light, crawled fast behind the bookshelf.

But I saw two things clearly. The first was that its entire flattened body appeared to be made of the same semi-transparent, brown-streaked material I had once found stuck to the trap in the cupboard. The second was that its left hand was missing a finger.

It must have been the moment my rational mind finally kicked back in, because I leapt out of bed and ran into the living room, locking myself inside.

I turned on every light I could find and frantically searched for tape, sealing the door shut.

Exhausted, I collapsed onto the floor. And everything went dark.

You’re probably thinking that once I regained consciousness, I finally fled that apartment and never looked back.

I’m sorry to disappoint you, but that’s not what happened.

Although, I did eventually leave the place – and, right now, I’m writing this from the bedroom of a small Airbnb – it didn’t happen that morning.

Don’t get me wrong, I was absolutely terrified.

I stayed locked in the living room for hours, gripped by the fear that it had somehow gotten in and was now watching me from behind a piece of furniture. Beyond the wall, I could hear my phone ringing.

First the alarm, then call after call from my boss.

Only when nature began to call did I somehow find the strength to peel away the tape and leave the room.

Outside, everything appeared to be exactly where it had always been. Even in the hours that followed, nothing happened.

That’s when a new thought started forming in my head: if that thing had truly meant to harm me, wouldn’t it have done so already?

“My boy, it’s more scared of you than you are of it,” my dad used to say, whenever I begged him to remove a spider from my room.

And though I still can’t believe anything could match the terror I felt when I first saw that thing, maybe – just maybe – there was some truth buried in his words.

Slowly, I began to convince myself that I could track the creature down. Maybe even kill it. Or at the very least, force it out.

So I resumed the search, this time even more feverishly, more methodically. And eventually, after a few days, I found something.

Not the creature itself, but something else.

Something that stirred whatever little sense I had left and convinced me, once and for all, that I needed to get out of that apartment.

I discovered it beneath one of the floorboards under the bed, which sat slightly raised. The entire space was stained by that wide, brownish liquid.

At first, I couldn’t quite tell what I was looking at. They resembled shards of old Christmas ornaments – gray and coated in something dark and sticky.

And then it hit me.

They were eggs.

And they had already hatched.
