All names were excluded except for the dogs.



Over the summer i got a dog watching gig from a family friend. At first I almost declined because, now don’t think I’m too spoiled, it was only $200 for the whole week - not to mention I had to stay there. Meaning that during the last high school summer of my life, I would get paid 84 cents an hour to twiddle my thumbs and watch their single dog. 



One week out from their vacation, I ended up realizing that I was not doing much anyway and would rather get paid to do nothing, than do nothing on my own. 



After I accepted their vacation time side quest, they invited me over that same day to meet their dog and get acquainted with their floorplan. On my way to their house, like any teenager does, I was blasting music, windows down, thinking of what to spend my fresh cash on. However, my dumb ass forgot to turn playboi carti down as I made it up their driveway and their toddler overheard. 



As I turned over the last hill on their surprisingly long driveway, I was immediately hit with the view of the above average sized country home. It took me back, not because there was a second home on the property, but because they had no reason for one. 



There was something off about the lot but I couldn’t tell what. The siding on the house was pristine but the grass wasn’t freshly cut. The driveway was freshly paved but the flowerbed was full of weeds. Not to air the family out, but my mom did tell me that their grandparents weren’t doing too well so it would make sense that certain things weren’t being maintained. Its easy to pay someone to pave your driveway, but its not easy to get out of bed and mow the lawn for hours.



I got out of my car and greeted the homeowners. Then I headed inside.



The first thing I noticed about the house was how quiet it was. I forgot there even was a dog until it silently scurried in between my feet. It immediately greeted me at the door and its two different colored eyes had a friendly charm to them. 



“That’s our dog, Olive.” The homeowner chipped in.



As I spent the next hour being toured around, I realized I was going to get my first taste of living on my own before college in a big ass house. I was pumped. It occurred to me that I would have done this job for a lot less money.



The next week was go time. I prebought unhealthy snacks, microwave meals, and downloaded shows to watch because of their spotty wifi.



The first day I was feeling uneasy. It was the first time I was completely alone in a house, with Olive of course, but still. I felt weird. But to be honest, it was definitely because my true crime podcast addiction was at a climax.



I spent the first day indulging in treats, playing with Olive, facetiming friends and exploring the house to calm my nerves. It did just that, I felt at home and was so excited to spend the night joining TikTok livestreams and having singing competition with strangers. 



Immediately after finishing a tiktok livestream talent show competition, the house started shaking. I shot up from the couch and turned off my phone and the silence of the house that greeted me on the first day rushed back in. I froze waiting for the next shake to occur thinking it was an earthquake. Then another shake happened with noise that followed that sounded like rapid-fire gunshots. I drafted a text to the homeowners immediately to ask if the neighbors down the road shot guns normally but then noticed the date on my phone. July 4th. 

I ran upstairs and looked out the window seeing red and blue in the sky. Under my breath, cursing myself I realized they were just fireworks. 



Making my way back downstairs, I looked up from my phone and Olive’s eyes greeted me. I automatically started to smile, but then she tilted her head to the side as if she wanted to say something but couldn’t. Now, I realized I was being paranoid, but that feeling stuck with me. 



Twenty minutes later the fireworks stopped and the silence returned. However, the comfort of my phone blastic instagram reels and tik tok audios filled the silence and allowed me to return to the bliss of distracting my thoughts. I eventually made my way upstairs into the comfy bed they provided and slept with the dog by my side in the wee hours of the morning. 



By day 2, I ran out of my measly stash of food faster than I thought. I decided that I’m going to make a daily run to a place to top up my food supply. I didn’t want to spend too much in advance in case I didn’t eat it all. I’m only getting paid 200$, can’t spend it all on food of course. Usually, I would make these runs in the late evening, a couple hours after I woke up. I found that I needed to get out of the house at least once or I’d get restless. Besides, it was a fun way for me to get some fresh air, get out of the comfort of my bed and blast music, to try and enjoy the fleeting summer time I had left. When I came back, Olive never made a sound but was always there to greet me when I opened the front door. 



By the third day, I was on the last resorts - the salad bags and fruits. To get my mind off of my eating predicament I realized I could help my parent’s friends out by cleaning up their flowerbed so that they came home to one less chore. In the summer heat, Olive and I were outside in the flowerbed, sweating bullets but it did not feel strenuous at all. After every patch completed, I always had Olive by my side to pet. In the shower, late that night, I decided I earned a special treat tomorrow.



Turns out on day four I did not realize how much food I would need to top up on, in an effort to try and save money. To make it up to myself for my horrible eating habits, I was going to splurge on myself tonight. I already fed Olive breakfast and dinner, and realized I didn’t feed myself anything. It was beginning to turn night time, the time that I left for all my other trips. On my way out of the house to my car, I got reminded of my promise to myself for my special treat and headed to chick fil a. 



On my way back, I was, of course, listening to my true crime podcast. At first I didn’t allow myself that luxury because I knew I would be freaked out, but I finally started to feel at home in this week long staycation. When I got back, I was clunkily carrying my nuggets and fries to the door fumbling for my keys in the pitch black. That’s when I heard a bark and the hair on my neck flew up. For the first time, I heard what the dog sounded like, if it was even Olive. 



I quickly got the door unlocked and flung it open expecting Olive to be at the door having to pee or greeting me like usual. She wasn’t there though. That’s when I felt like my paranoia wasn’t something I should just push away now. I started making my way to the back door to see if she was waiting there because that is where I usually let her go outside from. But that’s when I almost dropped by food. 



Olive was shaking in her crate.



Which was locked from the outside.



And her head was tilted again.
