"What the fuck is this?" Ryan finally said, as we were still recovering from shock.

Ash.

Everywhere.

The grass formerly surrounding the asylum— towering behind us now— was gone. Not a single blade to be seen, just dirt and weathered rock. No life anywhere. Bare trees, stripped of leaves and most of their branches, revealed vague shapes of city buildings in the distance.

There was a small dusting of ash on every surface we could see from our vantage point. The ground was covered in apocalyptic snow. Trace amounts of it drifted in the air under a gray, dusty sky. The sun was obscured and barely filtered through the murky haze.

"The author was right," I said. "This has to be Hell." I was convinced now. It couldn't be anything else.

"Everything is gone," George remarked, examining a pitiful, crooked stick poking up from the ground that may have once been a tree. "I agree. I think it might actually be Hell. The literal Hell."

Ryan was kneeling down, letting ash from the ground spill through his fingers, as he asked, "We were just in the asylum... how could there possibly be a door to Hell here?" He looked around. "It's like the apocalypse happened while we were inside."

Megan was still taking pictures; collecting proof of our impossible situation. "Everything is weathered and scoured by time," she said. "There's no way this could have happened while we were inside."

Jack had been silent, but now he spoke up. "This isn't that bad," he said.

We all looked at him, incredulously, and Megan stopped taking pictures. "How are you making jokes right now?" she asked. "I thought you were terrified that the door led to somewhere like this?"

"First off," he said, raising a finger, "I wasn't 'terrified'. Mildly anxious, perhaps, due to the perfectly normal fear of demons." He waved his hand to the side. "Secondly, I was serious."

Jack started pacing around. "This is really not that bad," he said again.

I gestured in the general direction of everything. "How is this not bad?" I asked. "We're literally in Hell. Have you lost your mind? Did this break your 'fragile' brain?"

Jack stopped pacing and faced us. "I don't know why all of you keep calling this Hell," he said. "We're obviously somewhere awful, but it's not necessarily Hell."

He raised his hand to stop us from responding and said, "When I think of Hell, I think of a few things." He started listing them off on his fingers. "Demons. Pits of fire. Brimstone. Screaming souls of the damned. My office."

Jack lowered his hands and looked out across the lifeless landscape, letting out a long breath through his mask. "None of those things are here—aside from my office, maybe, which would probably be destroyed."

He paused for a second in thought. "That would make this Heaven, actually."

He shook his head. "Either way, there seems to be nothing immediately dangerous here—aside from lung cancer. We've been out here for a few minutes without dying, the air is breathable through our masks, and we can leave whenever we want," Jack finished, gesturing to the open black door behind us.

We stopped for a moment to consider his words. Most of what he was saying made sense, and I didn't feel like there were any apparent threats to my life as I looked around. Still, I wasn't about to stay here any longer than necessary.

"Everyone step back," Megan said, as she backed away. "Jack just said something intelligent. He's already been possessed by the demon, it can't be him."

Before they could bicker again, George said, "Regardless of whether we call this place Hell or not, I think we should leave. Immediately." He turned to the door, ready to go back.

I was about to agree and go with him, like any reasonable person would, when Ryan interrupted me.

"Wait," Ryan said, standing up and wiping ash from his gloves. "We should think about this for a second before we go."

"Think about what?" I asked, exasperated. I leaned against the asylum wall, near the door. "Why would we stay here?"

"What will we do when we leave?" Ryan asked. "When we go back home and get all this ash off of ourselves?"

"Sleep," Jack said immediately. "In my bed and under a copious amount of blankets, to be specific."

"The answer," Ryan continued, ignoring Jack, "is that we are going to tell someone about this."

"What's wrong with that?" Megan asked, crossing her arms. "I have plenty of photos to prove we were here."

"It's not a matter of making people believe," Ryan replied. "Once someone looks into this, it will inevitably, and most likely very quickly, go all the way up to the government."

Ryan spread his hands. "We will never see this place again," he said. "We will never have another chance to see what this place has to offer."

Jack nodded. "He's right," he said. "The second the military gets their grubby fingers on this place, no one will ever know the black door exists aside from them." He shrugged. "I wouldn't be surprised if they turned this entire place into bombs, somehow."

"What if we don't tell anyone?" Megan asked Ryan. "Keep it a secret?"

Ryan shrugged. "We already removed the hatch," he replied, "so it's just a matter of time until someone else finds the door, even if we try to hide it."

George slumped down next to me. "Okay, and what exactly do you want to find here?" he asked, as he rested his head against the wall. "Is there a specific variety of ash you're hoping to see?"

"I just want to explore some of this," Ryan said, pointing through the barren trees toward the city. "Can you imagine how many abandoned and untouched buildings might be over there? What's inside them? Isn't this what we live for?"

I wanted to rub my eyes through my goggles, because all of this was giving me a headache. I couldn't believe that I was actually being convinced to stay and explore Hell. Jack might have the right idea about sleeping after getting home.

Everyone flinched when I suddenly pushed off the wall. "Okay," I said, rolling my shoulders. "No more stalling. Let's just go and get this over with instead of talking about it all day."

After a few moments to shake off some of the omnipresent ash—George's boots had almost been overflowing with it somehow—all of us got ready for a brief reconnaissance of Hell.

Soon, Megan was squinting at something in the distance. "I can't tell if our cars are still parked over there," she said, pointing. "Let's head that way first and check for them."

Hiking to the entrance of the asylum and down the path to the road was a bit easier without the grass hiding the rocky edges and holes in the ground. I thanked Hell for this one.

It took about ten minutes to make it all the way back, since we had been pretty far into the west wing before we came out the black door. The road was revealed to us near the end of our trek back.

"Well," I said, as we crested the last small hill, "we aren't driving."

All of our cars were there. Unfortunately, they were utterly destroyed.

Each car was rusted to almost nothing, the tires were gone, only a few pieces of broken glass remained in the windows, and the interiors were unrecognizable.

As I irrationally mourned my car, knowing that my real one was probably fine, the others were mostly doing the same.

"Hey," Jack said, nearby. "My car is gone." We went over to check.

Sure enough, there was an empty space where Jack had parked this morning. No tire tracks either, which was admittedly not surprising given that everything here seemed to be ancient.

Jack raised a fist. "The demon has gone too far this time," he said, in mock rage. "He can't get away with this."

"What is it with you and demons?" I asked, still baffled by how casually he accepted this place. "Are you trying to summon one?"

"I wanted nothing to do with demons," he replied, looking to the horizon and sighing with regret, "but they continue to force my hand."

I faced Ryan, who was still pondering Jack's missing car. "So what now?" I asked him, humoring his spirit of adventure, even in Hell.

"Let's walk the couple miles or so to the city," Ryan said, gesturing down the road. "We drove past some newer—or *were* newer—suburbs on the way to the asylum this morning. It's not far."

George was peering up at the asylum behind us. "Hey, speaking of the asylum," he said, "it looks exactly the same as it did before." We turned to look.

It was the same dilapidated edifice that we had entered only a couple hours prior. It now had a small coating of ash covering the exterior walls, but aside from that it was unchanged. Everything else in the world seemed to have changed to match it, instead.

Megan spoke my thoughts. "It fits in with this place more than we do," she said, taking a picture. "The apocalyptic tables have flipped."

Jack looked over at her, unimpressed. "Don't hurt yourself," he said, as he was kicking over rocks for some reason. "Maybe leave the shitty jokes to the professionals."

"I'll let you know if I find one," Megan shot back, not turning around.

It wasn't long after that before we started down the road towards the city.

An unnatural silence descended as we walked, aside from a faint breeze that carried nothing but dust and ash. No audible—or visible—indication of animals, insects, or people anywhere. I had heard the background buzzing of the city for so long that it was bothering me to not hear it any longer, especially as we were so close to what was previously a bustling metropolis.

Jack, unable to bear the silence—or perhaps not hearing his own voice for so long—broke it.

"Guys," he said, while holding up the ash-sprinkled screen of his phone, "I just checked, and we have no bars out here."

"Thank you for this critical piece of information," Megan said, as she took a picture of some scraggly remnants of trees off the side of the road, "I'm not sure what we'd do without you."

"Hey, to be fair," Ryan pointed out, "Jack is the only reason we found this place. We wouldn't be walking here right now if he hadn't found the hollow space behind that brick."

"To Jack," I said, holding an imaginary mug as I walked, "the man who sent us all to Hell."

Everyone "clinked" me, including Jack.

Silence pressed in again, and the unending desolation quickly killed the good mood. A dead world constantly revealed itself to us as we pushed through the ominous haze that covered everything. Jack didn't make any more jokes.

Ash accompanied and clung to us as we kept going, until the indistinct shapes of houses and some of the city buildings behind them, partially obscured by the gray smog, started to grow clear.

What we could see was simply apocalyptic. Houses were falling apart in disrepair and the cracked street was littered with unidentifiable, ash-covered debris. The few visible vehicles, "parked" in driveways, were just as destroyed as ours had been. Not a living soul in sight.

Unfortunately, it became obvious that we would not be entering any of these houses. Some had already collapsed, and the ones still standing were mostly tilting at angles or caving in; a single breath could topple them.

"Wow," Ryan said as we approached, "it's actually worse than I thought." He crossed his arms, frustrated.

"There's no way we're exploring these houses," George agreed. "You sure you want to keep going?"

Most of us were starting to regret our decision to come this far. The oppressive atmosphere was getting overwhelming, and even Jack seemed uneasy. Every new sight that presented itself to us screamed 'Hell'. Any excuse to go back would have been welcome, now.

Ryan was pacing around now, and I could tell his desire to explore was warring with his desire to leave.

Finally, Ryan pointed to the street running down the neighborhood, which became blocked from view by houses as it curved away, and said, "If we follow this street, after maybe five to ten minutes we'll hit a huge, six-lane arterial road that will give us a straight shot to the city center."

He quickly held his hands up and said, "I'm not saying we go all the way downtown—that would take too long, and I want to leave as much as you—but we can at least get a good view of some other buildings nearby." He pointed to Megan. "And Megan will get an excellent view of the skyscrapers."

Muted agreement as we reluctantly decided to make one last detour, although Megan seemed somewhat excited to take what might possibly be her best photos of Hell.

Ryan, Megan, and George were keeping their voices down as they talked about something, and Jack was walking ahead of everyone, alone. I increased my pace until I fell in next to him.

"Hey, you alright?" I asked quietly, almost whispering so that the others wouldn't hear. "This place getting to you, too?"

Jack looked tense as he turned to me. "You know that feeling of excitement you get when you go into an abandoned building for the first time?" he asked. "That fun little feeling of being creeped out in a spooky place?"

"Sure," I replied. We've been to plenty of abandoned places in the past, and that feeling was a big part of why we kept coming back for more.

"Have you ever considered that the reason those creepy vibes are fun is because you can end it by stepping outside?" Jack asked.

He looked me in the eyes. "But what if the creepy vibe doesn't go away when you leave?" he asked. "What if everything was abandoned? What if the entire world was abandoned?"

Looking away, Jack continued, "The creepy vibe stops being fun. It becomes real." He pointed at the desiccated husk of what was once a car. "It starts becoming fear. It begins choking you, bit by bit."

I agreed with him. Coming here was a bad idea. "We're getting out of here right after we reach the main road," I said. "If Ryan wants to go farther when we get there, we can just go back ourselves. We'll wait on the other side of the door for him."

He nodded and we walked in silence for a moment.

"I'm starting to think I was wrong," Jack said, after collecting his thoughts. "This could be Hell. I didn't expect—"

George appeared next to us and cut our conversation short. "Guys," he said, pointing, "do you see that?"

Ryan and Megan caught up to us as we looked down the street, which had stopped curving. We could now see much farther ahead.

I squinted. "I see the intersection," I said, while focusing, "something is there, on the ground."

Megan raised the viewfinder of her camera to her eye. "Let me check, I can zoom in." A pause. "There's a woman, kneeling on the ground."

She passed around her camera so we could all see.

A twenty-something-year-old woman knelt in the intersection, facing left toward the city center, with her hands raised up and cupping her cheeks. Surprisingly, she otherwise looked completely normal with her long black hair, fresh clothes, and red nail polish.

"What the hell is she doing there?" Jack asked. "Is she okay? Did someone else find a door like ours?" He started moving with purpose in the direction of the kneeling woman.

George and I followed Jack's brisk pace, as Megan and Ryan took up the rear.

"Why is she kneeling?" George asked, breathing harder as he kept up.

I was thinking the same thing. "It's weird," I said, as we drew closer. "She looks like she's praying or something."

Jack had a decent lead on us as we neared the kneeling woman. Most of her face was covered with her hands, so we couldn't tell if she noticed our approach.

"Hey!" Jack called out as he got close. "Lady! You okay?" He walked around in front of the woman. "We saw you—"

Jack suddenly screamed, turned around so fast he almost tripped, and sprinted.

George and I were taken by surprise as he almost ran into us.

"What's wrong?" I asked, adrenaline starting to flood through me. I whipped my head to the woman and back at Jack. "What the fuck happened? Jack?"

Jack was leaning forward against a stone wall surrounding a backyard, breathing heavily and pointing to the kneeling woman. "She... she...," he managed to get out before ripping his mask off and puking onto the ash-covered sidewalk.

Ryan and Megan caught up to help Jack as George and I went closer to the kneeling woman. We wanted to see what was wrong with her.

I came at her from the side and started to circle around so I could see her face. I steeled myself after seeing Jack's reaction.

This close, I noticed that her eyes were bulging—opened as far as physically possible—and her pupils were huge. Drugs? The red polish on her nails was running down her fingers—

Her face came into view.

It wasn't nail polish. It was blood.

*She was slowly ripping her own face off with her fingers.*

Her mouth was open in a frozen scream as her fingers dragged down on her shredded face.

"FUCK!" I yelled as I jumped back in shock. I was not prepared for this, despite seeing Jack's reaction.

Heart thundering, body shaking, and not thinking properly, I started to make the worst mistake of my life.

I instinctively turned to see what she was looking at.

Time slowed down and stretched into an immortal moment as my eyes tracked left, toward the city center:

---

Woman, ripping her face off...

Intersection...

Sidewalk...

Light pole...

Corner of building...

*Getting closer.*

An empty door frame...

Sidewalk...

*Closer.*

People, kneeling in front of me...

I was facing the city center.

*Almost there. Look up.*

More people. Dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands. Kneeling...

*Just a little more.*

A broken pane of glass.

I was saved from a fate worse than death by a reflection.

A reflection of the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

Horror instantly seized my mind with a titanic grip and squeezed. I couldn't even scream, my breath was trapped in my lungs. My eyes widened and my face went slack.

As I write this now, it hurts my head to remember. A throbbing pain pulses behind my eyes. Its memory slides across my thoughts like thick oil; a vile and corrupting sludge. Anathema to human comprehension. To sentient recollection.

It defies a rational description. I can only recall a few things with any certainty. The rest is forgotten—or perhaps unconsciously repressed to preserve my wavering sanity.

Tendrils, an uncountable number of them. They had a texture and color I had never seen before. An amalgamation of the bizarre and the unnatural.

A massive, gargantuan body. It had to be the largest living thing witnessed by human eyes. Its shape shifted constantly in a patternless rhythm. Parts of it disappeared one moment only to reappear the next.

Only one aspect of this impossible being drew my eyes, however. With an irresistible magnetism; a lightning rod capturing me in totality, I saw.

In the center of it was a pitch black, unfathomable abyss. A cosmic void. An all-encompassing embodiment of Nothing; leaving only ash upon reality in its wake.

A gaping maw of Hell.

I know now that if I had looked directly at that hideous darkness, I would have irrevocably lost my mind. Been reduced to a broken shell. A cursed existence, chained and subjugated by total fear.

Its reflection was overwhelming me.

My knees grew weak.

My fingers started to curl; to rise toward my face.

*NO.*

With a desperate rejection of a doomed fate, using every ounce of my willpower, I managed to violently wrench my eyes away.

My thoughts my own once again, I immediately remembered my friends. I needed to warn them; to stop them from looking.

*George.*

"DON'T FUCKING LOOK!" I screamed frantically, even as I turned to him.

I faced George.

It was too late.

He had looked.

His eyes were wide and glassy. His mouth open in a last attempt to scream. He had already torn his mask off, and his hands were rising again to his face.

I tackled him, pulling him towards the others, behind the corner and out of view of the city center.

"GEORGE!" Megan screamed as she ran and dropped to her knees beside her fallen boyfriend. Her camera clattered to the ground.

"What the fuck is happening? What is it?" Ryan asked me, looking terrified at my expression.

Jack fell down next to George, looking into his eyes and trying to grab his arms, which were still trying to reach his face. "What's wrong with him? George! Get up!" Jack yelled.

"DON'T FUCKING LOOK!" I screamed at them. "DON'T LOOK! GET AWAY FROM IT! WE NEED TO RUN! DON'T LOOK!" I was still delirious with fear. I couldn't think. My body was shaking uncontrollably.

"WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE?!" Megan screamed, tears starting to fill her goggles as she shook George, trying to get him to react. "GEORGE, SNAP OUT OF IT!" She sobbed as she took his face into her hands. "GEORGE, WAKE UP! LOOK AT ME! PLEASE!" She slapped him.

I looked at George, who was seemingly in a waking coma, still trying to slowly reach for his face. I looked down at my hands, trying to calm down. I was shaking so hard; breathing so fast. My vision was blurry.

"Fuck." I got out. "Fuck. Fuck." I was almost in control.

Ryan grabbed my shoulders and shook me viciously. "WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?" he screamed, trying to get me to acknowledge him. "Why is George like this?!"

I was silent a moment longer and was about to reply.

"What's that noise?" Jack said suddenly, letting go of George as he looked back at the kneeling woman. "Do you hear that?"

Whispers.

Overlapping, nonsensical whispers that had been almost unnoticeable a moment before, but were audible now and slowly increasing in volume.

"We have to go," I said, my control starting to slip again as I heard the whispering. "Back to the door. We have to fucking go, NOW!" I yelled as I stood up.

"We can't leave George!" Megan sobbed as she shook him. "We have to help him!"

"Get him up!" Ryan said, but I had already grabbed George and was lifting him with my adrenaline-fuelled strength.

"Don't look behind us," I grunted, as I began to drag George. "Whatever you do, don't look."

Megan grabbed George's other side and all of us started going as fast as we could back down the street.

"Don't look," I said as I stepped and stepped, over and over. "Don't look."

George was completely limp and his arms were still trying to contract toward his face as we held him.

"Why is he reaching for his face?" Ryan begged, scared.

"Don't look," I said.

Jack had been pale this whole time. "We have to leave," he said. "We have to fucking leave. This was a fucking mistake."

The whispering was getting louder.

"What is that whispering?" Ryan whimpered. He was completely freaking out now. "Why do I hear whispers?"

"We're moving too slow," Jack said, his voice pitched higher. "Come on. COME ON!" He was bouncing on his feet next to me.

They tried to help. To take over for one of us. But Megan and I couldn't stop. I couldn't let go.

"Don't look," I said again. I was repeating it like a mantra now. It was centering me, helping me stay sane. I just had to keep taking new steps. To repeat my warning. "Don't look. Don't look. Don't look." I completely ignored Jack and Ryan.

Megan was in shock, sobbing as we dragged George. "Why?" she asked. "Why? Why? Please, George, wake up. Please. Why?"

Hysteria was taking over as the whispers behind us grew to be as loud as our words.

Jack suddenly lost his nerve.

"WE'LL MEET YOU THERE!" he screamed, running away.

I couldn't react. "Don't look," I said.

Seeing Jack run, Ryan hesitated for a brief moment, the insanity closing in around him.

"Don't look," I told Ryan.

He surrendered to fear, and ran without a word.

Megan was still in a trance with me. "Why?" she asked, looking at nothing as we dragged George on and on. "What did he see? Why?"

The whispers were a cacophony of madness in our ears. It was almost the end.

"What did he see?" she asked again, turning to look at me. Her eyes were glazed over.

A wave of fresh horror washed over me as I snapped out of my delirium. I instinctively knew what she was about to do.

"DON'T FUCKING LOOK!" I screamed, desperately.

But she turned her head anyway. Lost her reason. Blinded by incipient grief, perhaps. Pressed on all sides by the sudden chaos of our situation. She had to see what did this to her boyfriend.

George and I fell to the ground as Megan let go. I couldn't bear his weight alone; my adrenaline was no longer giving me enough strength.

I didn't look to see why she dropped him.

Terror had taken over.

I screamed, and ran without turning back.

I ran.

I thought of Megan. Of George.

I ran.

I wept, tears filled my goggles; turning to ash as they spilled down my face.

I ran.

My blood turned to acid. My lungs were bellows almost bursting from exertion. My legs grew numb with pain.

Whispers chased me. They wanted me to listen.

I kept screaming between sobs. I screamed until I couldn't physically scream any longer.

I tasted blood as I sprinted the entire way back.

As I neared the asylum, I made a beeline through dead trees for the west wing; avoiding the treacherous path to the entrance.

Soon, I could spot the door in the distance. Its gleaming black metal was stark against the drab exterior wall of the asylum.

It was still open. Jack and Ryan had left it open for us. *For me, now.*

A final burst of adrenaline propelled me as I struggled to close the distance. It was my only hope of escaping the whispers of whatever was behind me.

The whispers abruptly came louder, nearly causing me to trip, as I lunged for the door.

I almost didn't make it.

I grabbed the bone-white handle with one hand as I flew through the door. I slammed it shut behind me so hard it felt like my arm tore off.

But it didn't shut.

I pulled frantically, trying to keep the whispers out. They were practically screams now. Only slightly dampened by the door. A soul-shaking susurration of the damned.

*Why won't it close? WHY WON'T IT CLOSE?*

Panic became desperation as I tried to find the reason it was stuck.

I looked up.

*A tendril was wrapping around the top corner of the door.*

I fled without hesitation—practically falling down the stairs—and abandoned any further attempts to close the door.

Bolting out of the hatch on the other side and jumping across the ash room, my voice was hoarse as I screamed.

"JACK!" I tore off my tear-filled goggles and ash-caked mask, throwing them as I ran.

A rattling breath. "RYAN!" I tossed my battered gloves.

The interior of the asylum was filled with vague shapes outlined in sinister shadows as I ran for my life, bouncing off walls and stumbling over ancient debris.

My mind was rejecting what was happening. It couldn't have been real. It was just a nightmare I would wake up from. Megan and George were fine. There were no whispers.

I cut across the reception hall to the exit and burst out into blinding sunlight.

Not caring about my safety, I ran down the perilous path towards our cars, leaving the asylum behind.

"JACK!" I shouted, painfully. It was hard to breathe. "RYAN!"

I could see Jack's car beginning to drive away.

"WAIT!" I screamed, not wanting to be left alone. Alone with the whispers. "STOP! PLEASE!" I waved my hands frantically as I made it down to the road.

He must have seen me, because he slowed down his car long enough for me to catch up.

I flung open one of the rear passenger doors and collapsed inside after I closed it behind me. Jack was driving and Ryan was in the front passenger seat. They both leaned over to look at me.

"Where's Megan?" Jack asked as I was trying to breathe. "George?"

"Drive!" I tried to shout. I started coughing, ash filled the air as my body shuddered. "It... followed... me!" Wracking coughs. "Door... still... open!"

Both of them went pale and Jack slammed the gas pedal to the floor.

The whispers faded.

---

We're running.

After a brief stop at Jack's house and the fastest shower of my life—the car left idling—we drove to the airport.

We considered telling the police, or even the military. This city needs to be evacuated. Our self-preservation won out, however. Being held for questioning is not going to happen. We're getting out of here as fast as possible.

Grief and guilt have caught up to us as we sit in a terminal, waiting for our flight. After I told Jack and Ryan everything, they were shell-shocked, and now the reality is setting in for all of us. We've been crying off and on for the last hour; the tears falling as fast as they enter our eyes.

We sent a few texts to Megan and George in case they made it out somehow, telling them we're leaving the city. Maybe they broke free when that... thing followed me? Or are they kneeling right now, with nails running down their faces? They haven't responded to our messages.

What have we done? What have we let loose on the world?

There are only two things we know for sure:

The door to Hell is open.

And the whispers are [back](https://www.reddit.com/u/leadraine/s/2yzYv3vYRm).
