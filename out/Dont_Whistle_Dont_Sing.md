*Hush, my child, don’t make a sound,*

*The trees are listening all around.*

*Step too light, breathe too deep,*

*The wind may stir, the roots may creep.*

*No whistle, no tune, no laugh, no cry,*

*Or something wakes where shadows lie.*

*For in the brush, it walks unseen,*

*And follows where the children dream.*

*So hush, my child, stay silent, stay small,*

*Or you may never come home at all.*

\-Words that have haunted not only my dreams, but my waking reality for most of my life. It’s the nursery rhyme that our parents sang to us almost daily as children. Only now, so many years later, do I realize the truth behind the words.

I know this is long and I’m sorry for that. There’s a lot I need to cover if I am to accurately describe to you what happened. 

I grew up in a small town in Virginia, the kind that had more trees than people. The woods bordered everything-homes, schools, even the old gas station where the clerk, a stooped man with a slow drawl and a permanent smell of tobacco\*\*,\*\* sat perpetually perched behind the counter, watching the town age. Everyone who grew up here knew the stories. The woods are old, older than the town, older than the roads that cut through it. They have many myths, fables, and legends around them. Some are bright. Most, not so much.

They say thousands of people go missing yearly in the wilderness of the United States. If that's the case, I wouldn't doubt that a good few of them end up in a place like this. The steep, rugged terrain makes it hard not just for you to find your way, but for others to find you. The woods have a way of sucking the lost in deeper, using one’s own panic to further disorient and confuse them. If someone does go missing here, the chances of finding them again are relatively low.

The adults in our town knew this, and so they gave us a set of rules to keep our names from being added to that long list of missing persons which our town had developed over the years. They were simple and made sense: don't wander too deep in the forest, be back home before dark, never go alone, always stay on the marked paths. They were clearly designed to be rules for the woods, but our parents applied the more general rules to our everyday lives. For instance, even if we weren’t playing in the forest, we were expected home by 6pm sharp. Still, even with this broader definition of our commandments, there was a clear emphasis-a deep and serious tone-that went hand in hand with the wilderness. None of us knew why, but we knew that you don’t question the rules when it came to the forest.

Along with these came another set of rules that didn’t make quite as much sense as the first. A set of laws that were just as serious as its predecessor that no one my age, or even the adults, really seemed to understand. And whenever we inquired about them, we'd be told that this is just how things are here. It’s the way our parents, their parents, and their grandparents had been raised for as long as anyone could remember. And so, each generation goes through the motions of our unspoken, instinctual law without truly understanding why.

Don't whistle or sing in the woods. Don’t look at the trees for too long. If the woods get too quiet, turn and leave immediately. If you can hear something behind you, walk-*don’t run*\-and never look back. We were to stick by these rules, and deviation from them would usually incur severe punishments. I remember a rumor of a school boy who had gone looking for his missing cat in the woods, claiming he had heard it calling out just off the trail. He went to go look, but returned empty handed an hour later just as the sun had set. His parents spanked him raw and he was confined to his room for a month. 

But when you're a kid, after they are spoken, warnings become nothing but words that can be easily forgotten or cast aside given the right temptation. We didn't understand the more sinister implications that our rules had. And the trees were an open invitation, a perfect playground for us to explore, a secret fortress for us to hide out in. They proved to be irresistible. 

The neighborhood I lived in was small, consisting mostly of older, retired folk or blue collar workers. On top of that, I was homeschooled by my father. For a kid in a situation like mine, friends are hard to come by. But I truly believe that, while I lacked quantity, the friends I did have had quality in spades. 

Katherine Werner and I lived across from each other. We met the day she knocked a baseball through the window in my parents bedroom. While my dad had a heated discussion with her parents about what I can only imagine were reparations for the shattered glass pane, she came up to me wearing a faded baseball cap, a bright red shirt, basketball shorts, and a proud smile

“Hey, kid, you see how far I hit that ball? If your house wasn't in the way, I bet it would've gone a whole mile.”

I shook my head no without a word, too shy to speak. In all honesty, this was my first time talking to a girl my age and I didn't handle it well. Her short brown hair, green eyes, and freckle dusted cheeks mesmerized me, preventing my tongue from forming words. 

“What's your name, kid?”

I projected my voice as best I could in an effort to match her apparent confidence and nonchalance,

“It’s Richard.”

“Richard? Like Dick?”  

She burst into laughter, doubling over her baseball bat, which she had propped on the ground like a cane. I felt the blood rush to my face. Sheltered as I was, I didn’t know what that word meant or why she found it so funny. Still, I don’t think I had ever been insulted by a stranger before that point, and I felt the need to stand up for myself.

“N-no! Like *Richard!* My name isn't Dick!”

Calming herself from her hysterical giggling, she spoke in a more friendly tone,

“Relax, Richy, I'm just messin’ with you. My name’s Katie.”

My defensive outburst had left me feeling even more foolish. I had never been called ‘Richy’ before, but for a reason I didn't yet understand, I liked that she had given me a nickname. I tried to remedy my embarrassment with an attempt at a polite, 

“It's nice to meet you, Katie.”

“You said you didn't see me hit that home run just now, right Richy?”

Again, I shook my head no,

“Nuh uh.”

Her mouth curved into a cocky smirk,

“Well then, I'll just have to show you again.”

The rest of the afternoon was spent playing baseball in the front yard. We were fast friends from that day on. That summer, we were attached at the hip, going everywhere together. We played in the neighborhood, wandered through the town, and explored the rim of the forest, the dark border of green, brown, and grey that kept the town inside like a cage. Katie was by far braver than I was. Where before I rarely left the confines of the fence bordering my yard, Katie gave me the courage to explore with her.

But, unlike me, Katie went to public school. So inevitably, the day came where our adventuring had to be put on hold while she went to elementary school. Each morning at 6:45 am, the faded yellow school bus would lurch forwards with a screech, carrying my adventuring partner away and leaving me to a day of boredom. My dad resumed my education too: flashcards, times tables, and vocab quizzes filled the early hours of the days during the week. Without Katie to explore with, I didn’t have the bravery to wander beyond the fence like I did before. Not even through the town, let alone the foreboding treeline behind our neighborhood. 

I attribute much of my passiveness and shyness to my father. Looking back, I think he was ashamed of himself for being a stay at home dad, something that he had no reason to be embarrassed of. My mother worked as a pharmacist and made good money, enough to support us all. But given the culture of the area and of the time, I believe he felt it was a man’s duty to provide for his family. Don’t misunderstand, he was a good father. But I think his disposition left a bit of a rift between us, making it difficult for me to connect with not only him, but others as well, at least during my childhood. 

I mention this only to further emphasize my lack of connection to others at the time. So you can imagine that I was overjoyed on the Tuesday morning that I saw Katie beckoning me from the backyard. She was wearing the exact outfit she had been the day we met. It was just before lunch time and I had finished my history lessons for the day. The day itself was beautiful- clear sapphire skies filled with the songs of finches and cardinals. I threw on my rubber boots and my power rangers jacket-I wanted to impress Katie- and ran outside to meet her. 

She greeted me with her same grin, 

“Cmon, I found something cool I wanna show you.”

She dragged me by my arm as she marched to the trees. Like I mentioned before, It wasn’t nearly the first time we had explored the outskirts of the woods. Many of our afternoons had been spent out here climbing trees, building forts from branches, or just sitting under the canopy. But, this day, Katie was leading me further than we had ever gone before. This made me uncomfortable- I knew that it was against the rules to go too deep. I spoke up, planting my feet like a stubborn dog resisting bath time. Katie turned to face me,

“Wait, Katie. My dad’s gonna be mad at me if he finds out we went past the trails.”

“Oh, come one, Richy. Your dad’s always mad. Besides, how’s he gonna know?”

“I-it isn’t really safe. We shouldn’t go further. What do you wanna show me anyway? It’s not something gross, is it?”

Her eyes sparkled with mischief,

“Maybe. You’ll never know if you don’t come with me.”

For a moment, a war raged inside my conscience. A lifetime of shyness and passiveness told me that I should just go home. Boredom was preferable over getting in trouble. But Katie was a pretty girl and I was a young boy. Logic stood no chance against the opportunity to impress her. I think she could see in my eyes that I was going to cave in. Before I could answer her she spoke, 

“Last one there’s a rotten egg!” 

With that, she dashed into the trees with more speed and agility than I had imagined her capable of. I paused for a moment, the fear of being caught not entirely dead within me. But Katie’s slowly shrinking figure made my mind up for me. I chased after her. I wasn’t nearly as nimble, tripping and stumbling over rocks and roots in my clumsy attempt to catch up to her. I had never left the paths before-never broken the rules so blatantly before. It was exhilarating. Walls of green and amber went by us as we dashed through the trees. Katie had stopped now, to my relief. Unathletic as I was, the race had left me panting like a steam engine. She had taken notice of this too, gleefully taunting me, 

“What's wrong? Forget your inhaler?”

“Shut up.”

I responded between breaths. At this point, I was still young and sheltered enough for ‘shut up’ to be the worst words I knew and I felt that using them might impress her. 

“We’re close now. It’s just over that hill there.”

“What is?”

She didn’t answer me. Instead, she grabbed my arm and led me through the trees. After a few more minutes of walking, we came onto a small clearing. The trees made way for an almost perfect circle I would estimate to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter. Katie hadn’t been lying, it was something to see. It was like this place was hallowed ground that even nature didn’t want to encroach on. I wish I could say it was some beautiful meadow abundant with flowers and streams, but it wasn’t. 

It was barren, nothing grew within the circle's perimeter- no tree, shrub, or even grass. In the middle of this circle was a formation of stones. The smallest of these came up to my chest while the largest towered over me. These stones formed a smaller circle within the desolate patch of ground, each angled inwards towards each other. The surfaces of the rocks that were facing inward had been smoothed to be completely flat.

I feel it’s a trope that at this point I would mention things like strange markings on the stones or maybe the scent of old blood lingering on the earth. But no, there was nothing like that. No clues as to what these stones were, how they got here, or what their purpose was. The smooth edges were blank, their only defining characteristic being their almost glass-like texture. 

I circled around them in awe and wonder, running my hands over both the smooth and rough sides. I was enthralled by them- by the mystery of what they were and why they were here. Still looking at the flat surface of the largest stone, I began to speak,

“How’d you even find these? They’re so-”

I trailed off in confusion. Katie was gone. I stood and took a few steps away from the stones, my head swiveling back and forth in an attempt to locate my friend. I called out,

“Katie?”

The foliage swallowed my call, strangling it with vines and leaves. She couldn’t have vanished, I had seen her standing behind me not 30 seconds before. She liked to mess with me, but she knew I wasn’t a brave kid. She wouldn't have abandoned me in the woods. I spun in desperate circles, scanning the trees for any sign of her. But all there was was forest. Thick, foreboding pines like a wall- a pen to keep me stuck here. 

Suddenly, this place no longer felt like holy ground. It felt forbidden-like I wasn't meant to have seen any of this. In my race to catch Katie and in my attempt to impress her throughout the day, I had lost track of 2 important variables. First, I hadn’t noticed how deep we had gone into the woods. I had never been this far and in my desperate spinning I had lost track of which way we had come from. Second, I hadn’t noticed the sun begin to set. What was left of the sun’s rays barely filtered through the thick canopy of green, creating a murky, dim atmosphere.

My heart sank and a knot of terror formed in my stomach. I was never going to find my way home. I was going to be one of those missing kids that my parents always used as cautionary tales. The woods were devoid of their usual sounds- not a single bird, frog, or cricket dared to make itself known. I was terrified, more terrified than I had ever been. The lump in my stomach moved to my throat, transforming into silent sobs of panic. I stood there, immobilized by fear and hopelessness. The rules ran through my mind; Don’t be in the woods at night, don’t stray from the paths, don’t venture too far alone. My thoughts seemed almost mocking in their hindsight. It was too late for me to follow them, and now I was doomed. 

The silence was interrupted by a quiet snap, but its volume didn’t matter. When there’s a place as quiet as the one I found myself in that day, the smallest noise is like a gunshot in a library. There was something there, standing in the trees behind me. I could feel its presence, feel its eyes boring into the back of my neck. Another rule flashed through my mind; if you hear something behind you, walk away and don’t look back. So, I decided I would follow at least this one rule, as I had ignored so many others that day.

It was my last hope, my only other option was to stay here with whatever lurked in the trees. So I trudged forward one shaky step at a time, my face still contorted with silent sobs. I walked away from the stones, down the hill, and through the trees. I don’t know how long I walked, but the sun had long set and the cold air stung my face. But that was the least of my worries. Every so often, I would hear it again trailing close behind: the crunch of a leaf, the snap of a twig, the thud of a carefully placed step. The distance between me and it was closing, and far faster than I knew.

The cold on the back of my neck was snuffed out by rhythmic waves of warmth. By now, my sobs had stopped, as had my thoughts. I focused only on one step, then the next, then the next. This went on for the most painful span of time I had ever experienced. I was sure that whatever was following me would take my life. Branches and brambles had sliced the skin of my arms and legs, tears and dust stung my eyes, but I felt none of it. All that mattered was walking.

My foot hit something solid, something that wasn’t the spongy earth of the woods. Pavement- by some miracle, I had stumbled onto a road. I adjusted my course, now wandering down the blacktop for only a few minutes when a police cruiser drove by me. They turned on their lights, illuminating the forest wall to either side of the road with blue and red, and turned 180 degrees to drive up to me. 

The young man in the car addressed me, 

“Son, are you lost? Are you Derrick’s kid? Your dad called us hours ago. How the hell did you end up out here?”

I didn’t answer him. I was so sure I was going to die that this salvation allowed me to feel emotions my body hadn’t permitted earlier. I burst into loud, snotty wails. The officer, taking that as an answer, helped me into the back of the car. After a few minutes of driving he asked me again,

“How did you get all the way out here?”

Not sure of what he meant, I asked,

“W-what do you mean?”

“Kid, this is more than 20 miles away from town. Did someone pick you up? A stranger maybe?”

I knew we had gone far, but 20 miles in a few hours for a child wasn’t possible. I shook my head no and responded through sniffles,

“We walked.”

“We? Who were you with?”

“Katie. She wanted to show me the rocks.”

“The Werner kid? She’s been home since 3pm. Look, just make sure that you work with the sheriff when we get you home, OK? He’s gonna want to know exactly what happened.”

I was silent for the rest of the ride. I had escaped the woods, but my dad had called the cops to look for me. I had broken every rule and now he was gonna lock me in my room forever, if he didn’t just kill me instead.

We pulled into my driveway, where I spotted the sheriff’s cruiser. He was standing by my front door with my dad. I expected anger, punishment, scolding, something. But my dad picked me up in a warm embrace. His normally gruff voice was filled with a level of emotion I had never heard from him before,

“Don’t ever do that to me again.”

Fresh tears prevented me from responding verbally, but I nodded against his shoulder. The sheriff questioned me about who I was with and where I had gone. I told him everything- from Katie’s invitation to the stones in the woods, and then finally to my long walk to the road, observed by whatever was behind me. 

The anger I had expected earlier from my father erupted out of him now.

“Katie? She brought you out there? I knew she was a bad influence on you.” Immediately, he stormed off to the Werner household and banged on the door, leaving me with my mother and the sheriff. What ensued was a yelling match between my dad and Katie’s. The sheriff interrupted them, instructing my father to go inside so he could gather the Werner’s account of events. 

I could overhear their conversation, and it made my stomach drop. Katie had gotten on the bus that morning. Her teachers and her classmates could verify it. She hadn’t skipped school.
