Boy’s Weekend had become a tradition over the years–a way for our childhood group of friends to do something outlandish once a year. No wives, girlfriends, or kids allowed. The tradition had formed naturally, well before we even gave it a name. Well, actually, it was Mitch and Mike’s wives who’d come up with the branding as a joke while they held a retaliatory Girl’s Weekend.



One of the trials of adulthood is drifting apart. Not that we weren’t still good friends, it’s just that we’d formed our own lives. Jobs become careers, girlfriends became wives, fucking became planned conception and diapers. 



And between our group, nights of hanging out, smoking weed and playing video games became dinner parties; became the occasional afterwork; became a group chat. Still wanting to hang out, though, we collectively began to find the occasional date that would work for everyone. As even those dwindled down and started to require more planning… we planned the fuck out of the them: trips to Mexico, hiking in Yosemite, dirt biking in Appalachia–over the years, we did it all. 



A single weekend each year became the norm. Enough time to plan something crazy, but short enough so it wouldn’t interrupt anyone’s responsibilities too badly. For the trips that took a bit more traveling, we’d arrange to take Friday off as well. 



While we usually agreed on the activity through a sort of Darwinism of suggestions and obscenities on our Discord server until the strongest idea claimed victory, last year was different. Steve made the solid point that we’d never picked his ideas, and so after a few jokes about his ideas always being shit, we agreed to let him pick whatever he wanted. If he picked something good, no harm done. If it sucked, we could return to never picking his ideas again. 



When his message popped up that we’d be going to something called Mr. Bigley’s Funhouse way up in Massachusetts, it was definitely signaling at becoming the former. 



\-



After a decidedly negative reception the plan had on our server, Steve made us all hop on a call to explain the whole thing. When his face popped up on the screen, he was grinning like an idiot, his thinning red hair shining from the sunshine peeking through the window somewhere offscreen. 



After our usual greetings and jokes as the rest of the gang joined in and turned their camera on, a silence fell as we waited for Steve to give his presentation.



When he didn’t, Mitch said “Well, Stevie. What the fuck is Mr. Buttugly’s Funhouse?”



“It’s Mr. *Bigley*,” Steve said. “And it’s not just a regular funhouse.”



Mike chimed in. “No shit. I couldn’t find a single thing about it online. You sure it’s not some brothel or something?”



“No, it is not,” Steve said, relaxing into his chair with the confidence of a man who was inexplicably sure of what he was about to say. 



“First of all, it’s invite only–adults only. They call it an interactive theater experience, and we’ll go through the whole thing as the only group, so no other guests or groups or annoying kids will be there at the same time.”



“So kinda like a haunted house?” I said. 



“Yeah, yeah. Just without the spooks, I’m assuming.”



“You’re *assuming?*” Mike said. 



Mitch sneered. “It’s gonna be scary bad.”



Mike shook his head with exaggerated disapproval. “Well, they don’t give out any spoilers. No phones or other devices allowed in either, so they can keep the experience secret.”



“So what makes it so special, then? What do we actually do there?” I said.



“I don’t know.”



“You… don’t know?” Mitch said.



“Nope. Not really. But you guys promised to let me choose, so this is what I’m choosing.”



Mike groaned and Mitch let out a long sigh. I kept my mic muted. 



“Well, I guess we’re going to Massachusetts. Alex, can you buy the flight tickets?”



“On it,” I said. 



\-



We decided to go in October, so for the next few months we planned the necessities around the trip: I got the flight tickets, Steve booked us rooms from a hotel nearby, and Mike and Mitch–instead of actually helping with the arrangements–spammed us with what might possibly be every single conceivable joke one could make about the name *Mr. Bigley.* By the time we actually met up at the airport and were having a drink before boarding, they’d simply run out. 



The flight was uneventful, but once we got to our rental car the skies had turned dark and a grizzly rain came down so hard it was hard to hear each other through the pattering. We made it to the hotel just fine though, and as it was quite late we went to our rooms to unpack before meeting up in the lobby bar. 



Once everyone had a drink in their hands, there was a nesting quiet between us. Even with all their joking, I could sense that Mike and Mitch were actually excited–or perhaps nervous–about what was going to go down tomorrow night. 



“So, when’s our slot again?” Mike said.



“Eleven PM sharp, as I’d previously mentioned about a thousand-bajillion times,” Steve said, quickly hiding a shit-eating grin behind a pint of real ale. 



Taking drags instead of sips of his old fashioned, Mitch chimed in. “Should we pregame before, it being so late and all?”



“Nah. We need to be sober for the experience. Again, a thousand-bajillion times.”



Mitch groaned dramatically. “Well, we gotta ask something, since there’s barely any fucking info about anything regarding Mr. Piggly’s Steakhouse.”



*Oh God, the jokes are back,* I thought. *I need to interject before this gets too far.*



“I for one am excited for our new overlord–*Steve*–, who brings us forth into the unknown. I do not *need* to know everything, because I trust him.” 



“Why thank you, Alex,” Steve said. “You won’t be disappointed. None of you will be disappointed.”



Mike shifted forward, landing his elbows on the table. “So you *do* know something more than we do?” 



Steve laughed. “Fuck no. I’m just never gonna hear the end of it if the whole thing’s lame as you think it’ll be.”



\-



The next day, after a slightly disappointing round of seeing the Massachusetts sights–mostly because it’s Massachusetts–we started making our way to the funhouse itself. Steve was driving. He had insisted on it, and also on not telling anyone else the address, so there was really no choice. Mike and Mitch had taken the backseat while I was riding shotgun. 



“So you found this place through a flyer,” Mitch said. “In a bar bathroom.”



Steve shrugged awkwardly with his hands on the wheel. “Yup.”



“And it had a number on it, and that’s how you got the address and the little info they gave you?”



“Yup.” 



We’d been driving through a nondescript road passing fields and old farmhouses for a while. Finally, Steve took a right on one of the scarcely placed intersections. 



“So how the fuck do you know if it’s even real? What if it’s a prank–or, more likely a scam–and they’re off to the Havanas with our hard earned money?”



It was a valid point. The tickets had cost us $100 per person, which wasn’t *that* much in adult money, but still.



“They seemed legit,” Steve said.



Mitch hunched forward to breathe on Steve’s neck. “They seemed… *legit?* That’s all you got?”



“*Nuh-uh,*” Steve said. “Nope. You’re not gonna give me shit for this. Remember that hiking guide you got us? That was just some guy who *happened* to live nearby, who *happened* to have the day off, and who–guess what–*happened* to be more than happy to take our money. And he nearly got us killed, taking us way off the fucking trail!”



Mitch pondered this for a moment, then slumped back to his seat. “You know what, Steve? You’re right. You’re absolutely right, and I won’t give you shit for this. I’ll just return to giving you shit for all the other things that are weird about this whole thing.”



Everyone laughed, although for driving down a deserted long road, Steve was gripping the wheel a bit too tightly, like he was expecting to hit a deer. 



\-



Nobody gave Steve shit when we arrived. We couldn’t really, because the place–situated between overgrown fields and backed by a thick forest–was exactly what you’d expect an old-timey funhouse to look like. Except bigger. *Way* bigger. 



From across the small parking lot we admired the place. A huge cartoon mouth adorned the entryway on all sides, and on the walls were shining lights and wood painted with bright colors depicting zebras, lions, men riding unicycles, spirals, and all other things you might find in a circus–or a freakshow. Above the gaping maw of the entrance was the grand jewel: a giant cutout of a short, pug-faced, pudgy man wearing a suit ripping at the seams, holding a shiny black cane. The words “Mr. Bigley’s Funhouse” were written with bright-red light bulbs above him. 



It all would have been horribly kitschy if it hadn’t been so *awesome*. 



When Mike whistled low and slow, signifying the strange sort of approval only men seem to be capable of expressing, I could almost feel Steve’s shoulders relaxing. “Well?” he said, turning to face us. 



“Well, it’s here alright,” Mitch said. 



While Mitch was annoying by default, I was starting to get a bit tired of his constant whininess. “C’mon, Mitch. It’s pretty fucking cool. Let’s try to enjoy this, yeah?”



Steve pointed his gaze at me and mouthed “Thanks.” 



“You guys know you can just tell me when I’m being a dick, right?” Mitch said.



“Sure. But sometimes you gotta self-regulate, We can’t all be your mom, y’know.”



Mitch’s eyes glided down ever so slightly, which meant that he got it and was sorry. 



“That’s cus you all wanna do my mom,” he joked. 



Mike chimed in. “Well, he’s not wrong.” 



“That woman has aged like fine wine,” Steve retorted with a smirk. “Well boys, shall we go in?”



\-



As we made our way into the cartoon mouth and opened the wide double doors, it somehow felt like we were going underground even though the floor was level. The room before us was like a hotel lobby from a hundred years ago, thin and long. Soft light cascaded down from two massive, candled chandeliers while small beams shot up from wall lamps, giving the room an illusion of elongation. The ceiling was fully mirrored, although the panes were crooked and bumpy from wear so as to give our reflection an uncanny feel.



On both sides of the room were red velvet couches that looked like no one had ever sat on them. Nested between them were two unmarked doors on both sides. Beyond, at the tip of the room, was a wide, curved wooden desk, and behind it stood a woman with a straight spine and her hands tucked neatly behind her. She looked like a part of the decor, almost like a statue. She didn’t wave to us or say hello, making us trudge our way towards her as we took in the odd, beautiful room, our heads on swivels. Something like incense wafted through the air.



Steve went up to the desk and greeted the woman, who nodded in return. 



“Are we late?” Steve said.



“Not at all, Mr. Hudson. We’re so very excited to have you all here at Mr. Bigley’s. This your first time?” 



“Uhh, yep. For all of us.”



“Fantastic. We love to see new faces around here.”



The woman reached under the desk and took out a red chest with shiny, golden dragons painted on, placing it carefully before us. 



“Now we must ask you to relinquish all electronic devices into this box. Don’t worry, they’ll be locked here safely,” she said, tapping the nail of her forefinger on the keyhole. “You’ll get your devices back once you’re ready to leave. This is our only rule, so we appreciate your cooperation. Unfortunately, failure to comply will force us to immediately escort you out of the funhouse without a refund.”



“Loud and clear. Come on boys, drop your phones in,” Steve said, smiling at the woman.



As we did as instructed, Steve’s brow tightened. “Wait, aren’t you gonna ask us for our tickets?” 



The woman smiled, teeth peeking out between her strawberry-red lips. “Why of course, Mr. Hudson. But as you’ll find, they’re right at my reach. If I may–”



The woman reached out towards Steve, placing her hand behind his ear. When she pulled it out, she was holding four tickets like a hand of poker. Like a magician, she slowly turned her arm in a semicircle for all of us to see, then deposited the tickets under the table. 



“Welcome to Mr Bigley’s Funhouse!”



\-



The woman escorted us into a long, narrow hallway. As we walked inside, she stayed behind at the door, and we all turned to look at her quizzically. She was already smiling, but something in her facial movements made her seem like she smiled even more as she addressed us. 



“The fun begins behind the door at the end of the hallway. Be sure to keep your wits about you, and don’t get lost!”



The door was closed with the precision of someone who’d worked there for a long time, the handle turned with a skill that made the mechanism seem silent. We turned to face each other, and I thought I heard a small *click* coming from the door. *Did she lock it?* 



“Well, how about we go in, then,” Steve said, Interjecting my thoughts. The rest of us nodded, the electricity in the air robbing us of jokes or even small talk. 



It wasn’t exactly surprising–and in a way, almost a letdown from the grandiose design of the entrance–what was behind the door. Funhouse mirrors of all different shapes, colors and sizes were placed in meandering rows that followed a pathway that held worn, painted on arrows leading the way. It didn’t seem like you could really get lost, although I couldn’t see whether the pathway forked further in. 



“Lame,” Mitch said, walking up to the first mirror, blue and wide. “Oh look. I’m fat and wide. How fun!” 



“It’s only the first thing,” I said. “They probably just want us to get warmed up first.”



Steve muttered something under his breath and began walking further in, not paying mind to the different distorted images the mirrors gave. The path circled around enough that I soon lost sight of him. Maybe it was better that he go alone for a moment, so he wouldn’t have to listen to Mitch being a dick. 



Mitch was already looking at the second mirror. “Ooh. This one’s good. Guys, look! My legs are all itty-bitty, but the rest of me is long! It’s like I’m a uh… oompa-loompa? Hobbit? Guy with short legs?”



“I bet if you took your pants off, your dick would get so small it would vanish completely,” Mike said.



Letting the M&M’s jab at each other, I walked along the mirrors, glancing at each one. I didn’t want to say it out loud–and I wasn’t going to–but this was a bit lame. But I still felt optimistic. I mean, the place was huge, so there could still be a bunch of cool stuff to see. 



Mitch and Mike caught up soon, and with the joking around we actually had a few fun moments. But we always had fun, even when we just got to hang out. We didn’t *need* to do anything to enjoy each other's company. 



Something started nagging at the back of my mind as Mike was using one of the distorted mirrors to show Mitch how he’d jack off if he had extra-long arms (the jokes were getting worse by the minute). The thought revealed itself as Steve, and the lack of his presence. 



“Uhh, guys? Where did Steve go?”



“Probably scouting the place to see if the rest of it’s as lame as this,” Mitch said. 



“Well, if it’s so lame maybe we should head up and see where he’s at. 



“Fine, then.”



The path was a lot longer than I thought, the room seemingly taking up what I could only imagine to be half or a quarter wing on the whole building. We must’ve passed hundreds of mirrors repeating the gags of their predecessors when we found Steve staring into one of them. From the reflection, I could see his eyes locking into something far away. The room felt more dark, somehow, like the lightbulbs were on the verge of burning out.



“Hey, Stevie,” Mitch said. “Looking into the eyes of the culprit for the *lamehouse*, did you?”



Mike chuckled. I didn’t. Steve gave no answer, keeping his eyes on the mirror. 



“You alright, bud?” I said, taking a few steps towards him. It was like he didn’t even hear me. Something seemed off. Maybe we’d given him too much shit, and I felt like apologizing to him. 



Even as I stood next to him, his gaze didn’t move an inch. I couldn’t tell if it was just bad timing, but it seemed like he wasn’t even blinking. Gently, I put my hand on his shoulder. 



“Oh,” he said with surprise in his voice, turning to look at me. “Alex. Nice to see you.”



“Uhh, you too, bud. How’re we holding up?”



His eyes set back to the mirror. “Do you see her?”



“Her?” I asked, making my way behind him, matching with my own eyes approximately what he was seeing. There was nothing out of the ordinary; no woman; weird distortions that could look like one; some mannequin in the background. Just two guys staring at a regular mirror. 



*Why is this mirror normal*, I thought until I noticed something in Steve’s eyes. The pupils were dilated, and the muscles around his eyes drooped ever so slightly.



“Fuck,” I said, turning back to face the others. “I think he’s taken something.”



“What do you mean *taken something*?” Mike said.



“I don’t know. Drugs, or something. His pupils are dilated. And he’s obviously acting fucking weird.”



If Steve was on drugs, we needed to get him out of there. Not just because it was a bad idea and against the rules, but because he *never* took anything. He was an alcohol-(and-cigarettes-occasionally) type of guy. 



“Drugs?” the others asked almost in unison. 



“I don’t fucking know, but something’s up with him. We need to get out of here.”



Mike sighed. “Fuck, alright then. *Fucking Steve.*”



Steve had said nothing more, which seemed to convince Mike and Mitch both that something was off.



Turning back to him, I said “C’mon, buddy. We should head out. Don’t want you tripping balls in here.”



“No,” he said. “Not going.”



“Well, actually, you are. This isn’t cool, man. C’mon, let’s just go and ask if we can come back tomorrow or something.”



“No.”



Mitch and Mike joined me to gently push him towards the exit, trying to soften the blow with calm words the way you do for someone who’s in a different state of mind.



But Steve wouldn’t budge, trashing our hands off him, keeping his eyes steadily on the mirror. “Stop, stop! I’m not going. She’s so beautiful. She’s coming here! Stop!”



“Look, Steve. I’m sorry for being a dick and all, but we really should go. No hard feelings,” Mitch said as he took Steve by the shoulders in a grip that twisted his shirt into bundles under his hands. 



He tried to push him off, but Mitch was stronger. Wriggling like a fish, Steve tried to find a way out of his grip as the fisherman held on, not letting go of his catch. Finally, Steve relaxed enough to let Mitch pull him out for just a moment, giving himself enough room to swing his body back in force towards the mirror. 



The crash was briefly followed by a low rain of sharp glass clattering to the floor, leaving half the mirror on the floor. 



Taken aback by the sudden violence of the situation, Mitch took a few steps back while muttering undirected obscenities. We *all* took a step back, and simply stared at Steve, whose face had turned sorrowful as he scanned the shattered pieces of the mirror.



Suddenly, his face lit up and he picked up a shard of glass from the floor. He lifted it up and stared at it.



“She’s still there.”



With Mitch still reeling in the situation, Mike sprung into action and leaped toward Steve. It was a matter of inches that the sharp swing didn’t cut his throat as he landed on the floor next to Steve, barely avoiding the edge of the shiv.



“Stay back!” Steve said. “Stay the fuck back!”



Mike touched his neck with disbelief, trying to see if there was a wound there or if he’d gone into shock and simply didn’t feel it.



My hands were up in an emote of surrender before I could think to do so. “Okay, let’s just all calm down here.”



Keeping my eyes on Steve, I turned my head towards Mitch and whispered “Get the lady.”



Thankfully I heard him running out behind me as I turned my head back. “So keep the mirror, then. Keep it and we’ll all get out of here, and then we can talk about it. That sound good?”



Steve held the shard in his hand so tightly that droplets of blood were beginning to form at the bottom of his fist. “She wants me, Alex. Don’t you get it? She wants me. She wants *inside of me.*”



“Sure thing. Can she be inside of you once we’re out of here? Besides, we need to comp the place for the broken mirror, and ask the lady if it’s okay for you to keep that piece.”



His eyes were darker than before, like the pupils were dilating over their borders, infecting the rest of his eye. I couldn’t tell if he was looking at the piece of mirror or at me. 



Like a surprise that hadn’t yet been determined good or bad, Steve laughed. “She wants to kiss me.”



“What,” Mike said, speaking for the room. 



With a flash, Steve brought the shard of glass to his mouth and began to kiss it. Little pecks here and there, the way you would for a pet when they were acting cute.



“He sure is on something,” Mike said, the words a poor attempt at relieving the tension as Steve had already moved on to french kissing the glass, his tongue grazing the sharp edges, drawing blood. 



“What the fuck,” I said at no one in particular. *What could Steve have taken so as to not feel any pain,* was my first thought, closely followed by, *and what the fuck is he doing?*



The room seemed to get smaller as the carnage grew. The trickles of blood quickly became rivers flowing down his neck, drenching his shirt in bright red. With what had happened to Mike I didn’t dare to try and physically stop him–not as long as he held the glass in his hand. 



The first muffled crack coming from Steve’s mouth was difficult to believe as something that actually happened, yet I could feel the sound in my stomach. Another crack came, this one smaller, followed by full-on crunching as he began to chew on the glass, the sound indistinguishable from the cracking of teeth or mirror. Thick goblets of blood shimmering with tiny shards of glass escaped his mouth. If there was something me or Mike could’ve done, we didn’t do it. 



When the first, hard *gulp* came, my vision blurred and my head began to feel like it was going to fly up like a helium balloon. 



And through it all, Steve smiled, kissing and chewing and eating the piece of glass, swallowing it down inside him, his flesh like grass to a sharpened scythe, slicing everywhere it touched. 



The sound–wet and heavy–of Steve’s tongue hitting the floor was oddly comforting amidst the scraping and shattering of before. *Of just a minute or few ago,* I thought. *What the fuck is happening?* 



The next time Steve tried to swallow, it didn’t go down. A lump formed in his throat, and a faint wheezing appeared as he failed to breathe properly, the piece stuck in his throat alongside the rest of the clotted carnage like a plug to a drain. 



“Is he choking?” Mike said, flicking his eyes from me to Steve and back to me, like he was asking permission to do something. 



“I…I think so.”



Mike made his way behind Steve carefully, not wanting to get another glass knife anywhere near him. Steve’s body was going more limp by the second, his arms flopping next to him in freefall as he simply let the choking continue, as if he was completely fine with what was happening. 



In a dash Mike went in, grabbing Steve by his ribcage from behind, and began to pump hard and quickly. I was pretty sure that it was more violent than Heimlich had intended–not that there was much to lose by then. Whatever light had been left behind Steve’s black eyes was fading, leaving his eyes a dark matte color.



For a small sliver of time, the sight was almost comical. Mike hugging–almost humping–Steve from behind while Steve looked like he was playing dead, letting his body ragdoll with the staccato movements. 



That is until it wasn’t, and reality set back in. 



Mike was losing strength, each pump more lazy than the previous. Whatever was in Steve’s throat had nested itself thoroughly and completely. When Mike finally stopped, Steve’s body slumped to the floor, his face blank and eyes black, the rest covered in blood and spit. 



Mike panted loudly and stared at the body. We both did, as if looking at our dead friend was a piece of a larger puzzle that might at some point fall into place if we just stared long enough. That if we took it in enough, it all might start making sense. 



What I got instead was fear with no sign of resolution. Having regained his breath, Mike was suddenly muttering *no, no, nonono,* as I noticed that my hands shaking. *When had they started to shake?* The feeling that there was something even more wrong than just what had happened to Steve gnawed at my mind. Everything we’d seen had *happened*, but the holes in between made no sense. How had we ended up in this situation?



“We need to get out of here,” I said. 



Mike struggled to avert his gaze from Steve. “What?” 



“We need to get the fuck out. Now.”



An eerie calm fell into his body; the tranquil following a storm. “Oh. Okay.”



But Mike’s head wasn’t straight. Well, neither was mine, but I had enough sense to find my way out. Get to safety. Call someone. He apparently didn’t, so I had to grab him by his arm and start dragging him away from the red hell of death laying on the ground. Thankfully, he followed, and the pathway leaned to the side enough to cut our sight from Steve, so Mike could no longer stare at him. 



When Mitch screamed from somewhere towards the lobby, I felt like a betrayal for only then remembering that he was still here. We had to find him before we got out. 



It made no sense that Steve was dead. It must’ve been a freak accident; bad drugs; a psychotic episode, or something. It was a one-off chance. 



Yet hearing Mitch scream, my first thought was that he too was going to die. That we were all going to die, just like my friend [Steve](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com).
