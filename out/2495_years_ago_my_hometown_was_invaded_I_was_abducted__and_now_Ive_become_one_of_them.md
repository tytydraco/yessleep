 

467 B.C. - The sun was setting upon “————————” , an island once located near “——————-”. I don’t remember the exact date as to when my first encounter with the strange phenomenon took place but I do remember I was 7 years old and it was also one of the few times I went hunting with Araf , my father . We were hunting for most of the day and by the time it was evening and we were packing up our tools , we were both exhausted . Which was why I thought my mind was playing tricks on me when I looked into the horizon and in the midst of all that orange I saw blue and purple particles floating in the sky . Once I took notice , they seemed to vanish … 

This went on for the next 5 years , each year the particles seemed to get bigger and unlike my first encounter with them , where they all seemed so distant from one another , with each passing year they seemed to unite with each other … getting stronger . In the mind of a 7 year old it seemed like they were forming a picture … a symbol…or perhaps even a por——

468 B.C. - It wasn’t only the particles anymore , it was the voices that could be heard on a daily basis when each particle either grew larger in size or connected to another particle . By that point my hometown had caught on to what was going on , although no one seemed to have a plausible theory as to why this was happening nor what was causing it. It’s also worth mentioning that by this point the particles were covering about 25% of the  sky and so the amount of light we received from the sun was reduced significantly.

470 B.C. - We were done for , we were no longer hearing voices , we were hearing screams … they were… insufferable . During the couple months they grew louder no one in our town seemed to get any sleep at all . This all led to people becoming more violent and more insane. I could hear my little  brothers wailing day and night as they felt their eardrums were going to burst with each passing moment. It’s also worth mentioning that the particles had now blocked 75% of the sky and we were no longer receiving light , or at least not any that could help us get through the day, which is why we were forced to make our own homemade lamps . Since we were up all day and night all I could do was cover my ears , look out the window and watch as the dots expanded , and expanded and expanded.

472 B.C. - At the time ,  I wouldn’t know how to even describe such a behemoth, but now with all the knowledge I’ve gathered , I can say with certainty that it was nothing but a Nebulisk , a giant void surrounded in its entirety by a purple aura that covered the sky , the black void kept spinning until it let loose….

At the time it happened I was so frightened that I quickly went to my father and explained to him in tears that there were giant monsters falling down upon us . He took my concerns seriously , grabbed me by the hand , and ordered our entirely family to abandon the house immediately . We went for the woods…

We ran for a long time while constantly hearing a hoard of footsteps trailing behind us , they were catching up . I knew we could only keep this up for so long , however my mind was so concentrated in escaping that I didn’t care , which is why I was taken by complete surprise when I heard my mother scream , I looked back for a quick instant to see her leg being devoured by some giant black alien creature , twice the size of any human . I didn’t see its features at the time but I would soon find out . I glanced away immediately and just kept running through the trees with tears in my eyes , dashing left and right to try and lose them . I noticed no one was following me , and I was completely alone . I was still determined to escape with my life from whoever these bastar- sorry can’t say that ,  who rui-changed my life entirely. I kept running until my legs finally gave out ...

 I don’t know how much time passed but I woke up somewhere foreign. It definitely wasn’t earth . The terrain was purplish and very rocky . I was 13 at the time by the way , and when I got up two giant soldiers escorted me , I could finally see their features  now. They were completely black and had purple glowing eyes , they had pointy ears , kind of like that of an elf’s , and they had fangs . They had all types of different armor on them , which to me was foreign since the only weapons I knew of were bows and arrows . We walked for a long time , until we had made it to our destination … 

A giant palace-like structure , black and purple were its colors . I looked to my sides and could see spaceships landing . They opened their doors and I could see kids , just like me , they were different sizes and presumably different ages . Some looked younger, some looked older , but none were adults . The two soldiers stopped me at the steps of the palace and I waited as the kids from the other spaceships arrived on the steps of the palace . When everyone had finally made it there , I looked all around me and I could see hundreds of kids piled up with one another , some were crying and others were in complete shock. I was in the front of the pack and suddenly a hoard of soldiers just like the ones that escorted me , led us up the stairs they spoke in an ancient language known as “———-”.  We climbed up the stairs until we made it to a giant red metal door , when it opened we were completely blinded by its darkness ...

&#x200B;

We all entered and the soldiers spoke once again in an ancient tongue which I will now translate to “ General X , we have brought what you have requested from us. You may do with them as you wish”. I suppose General X ordered them to split us into groups because suddenly two groups were made , most of the kids were piled into one group but only 20 of us were piled into another . I looked to my left and my right and saw as two doors emerged . They were just like the one at the entrance except smaller , and just like that we went in. The hallways were filled with weapons and pictures of stuff you rather not know about . We made a left and entered another dark room and in the middle of it , a light turned on and we could see a giant throne , and sitting in it was completely dark figure , no eyes , no mouth , he did have however a giant helmet , it looked like a neo-samurai helmet and when we got up we could see he had a giant black cape on his back . 

&#x200B;

The soldiers said the following “These were the best we could find for your consumption , however let us please separate 3 of them from the group for other purposes.” He nodded his head in approval and I was taken from the group along with 2 others . We made a left and then walked down a long corridor until we met ourselves with a gray metal door . The soldier pushed us aside and grabbed a key out of his pocket and opened the door . He grabbed a torch that illuminated as soon as he grabbed it , it had a purple flame , just like his eyes . We walked down the stairs and were led to a chamber. I unfortunately cannot explain the process of our transformation , however after an X amount of time we were completely transformed into one of them … except not really .

We felt almost superior ….

5 more soldiers entered the room and spoke to me in their ancient tounge , except now I could understand them . They handed me a giant cape and a helmet. They told me a ceremony would take place in the throne room , in which we would be given a role in this kingdom as well as a new name . All 3 of us exited the chamber and retraced our path back to the throne room . 

As far as the ceremony concerns , I cannot go into detail as to what happened there , however I was given a new name , which translated into your native tongue is “Annihilation” , I am the second most important person in the kingdom , and control a large army , and just like that I had become of them …

That was 2495 years ago ,

As time went on I learned many things about the kingdom and the way it works . Out of all the teachings however , I am only allowed to share one with all of you , this pertains to the invasion that occurred so long ago: “Every 2500 earth years , we serve the right and consider  it to be our responsibility to invade earth in order to preserve all the life and order present in “———”. We will take up to “———”children from all around earth , most for our consumption and others to be completely transformed into one of us . We believe this to be the greatest honor of all . People who resist , will be exterminated at once , and the ones who don’t will remain. 5 years before we arrive, a nebulisk will form , this will allow us to enter earth with ease.”

Do with this information as you wish , you may choose to spread it , or to keep it to yourself , I won’t judge.  Regardless of your final decision just remember time is running out , and for that “We are sorry”.
