My grandaughter Tamara is helping me post this on reddit, but I asked her not to correct my english too harshly. She's the one that suggested this subreddit for sharing my memories too

 I’m not sure why I’m telling this story now. Maybe my years are catching up to me and I’m afraid that the last witnessing of the events that transpired more than seventy years ago will be lost together with my fading memory. Perhaps, I am feeling nostalgic, missing the days of my childhood, when the biggest issues seemed to be an upcoming history test or a PE class, I felt desperate to skip. Or maybe I’m just overly cautious, feeling a pressing need to share this information in case one of you ever decide to go out and find the town where I grew up. It still exists, I know it. I keep getting letters with old soviet postmarks on them.

Now, I won’t be the one to try and talk you out of finding my birthplace, that’s not my job, and frankly, If I was less sick, I would love to come back and visit it myself. But be cautious and if you already find yourself there, I’ll suggest saying that Elena sent you to see Rory. They won’t ask any more questions after, I’m sure of that.

I was born and raised in a medium sized town in northern Europe. My little hometown bore the loving name of Solenvol. The wall of sun, you could say, if you translated a mishmash of languages that the name encapsulated within itself. It had about ten thousand residents give or take, two hospitals and a few shopping centres me and my brother used to loiter in, before Leshenko burned alive in that factory accident... And our peculiar tradition that kept us safe for all those years.

We celebrated Christmas every day.

My mother would wake us at eight o’clock sharp so we would all go down to the living room and sit around the potted plant in the middle of it. We never had a real Christmas tree (‘What would the people say, deary? A Christmas tree in the middle of June?’) so a begonia was out to do.

We always thanked the Merry man for visiting us (Santa was not a thing in Soviet union, and Ded Moroz would only come on New Year's Eve) and then we would unwrap our presents. It was socks. It was always socks.

“What do we say now?” Momma would coo.

“Merry man go away, visit us another day” Me and my siblings would reply in unison.

And he did.

Every day.

Every God damned day.

You know what else happened every day?

We had to wear those socks to school or if we were just going out. They would be obviously handmade (quite poorly may I add) and if anybody asked us if they were a gift from grandma, we would have to say that no, it was a gift from the Merry man. As momma explained, he didn’t like his accomplishments being stolen and would have gotten angry if we lied.

We didn’t want to anger him again.

You see, my youngest sister Lucinda didn’t receive any gifts from the Merry man no more. She wasn't grateful enough, momma said.

So he had to punish her.

I remember that part vividly even though I was only twelve years old. It started as a normal saturday, we had no school so after celebrating Christmas and unwraping our daily socks (mine were purple) we all went out to do our own things. My younger brother, Ambers, was preparing for a psysics test, slumped over his books, his bright green socks visible from the other side of the room.

I think, before all of this, he actualy liked this tradition.  Unlike me or Lucinda, both of us starting to think it was some elaborate prank from our mother, he always seemed eager to unwrap the gifts.

I was helping mom cook lunch. She was making some beetroot soup and her hands were stained pink. 

And Lucinda... Little Lucy... She begged and begged till our mother finaly let her go to the new cinema with her clasmates. 

"No boys" she added pointing at her with a spoon "you can take some money from the metal tea can on the shelf. Treat is as an early birthday gift."

"No boys" Lucy agreed hapilly before dashing out the door not so long after.

I remember looking at her through the kitchen window.  Getting further and further away. With her dotted grey dress and cute purple sandals she got last year.
I didn't even register that she wasn't wearing socks.
Three of us ate lunch. I quized Ambers on chapter seven of his texbook. States of matter it read. States of bullshit, he said.

Then we played a bit. He had some new soldier figures and we pretended that my raggedy doll was one of the grieving wives. (It was not a fun game).

When Lucy didn’t return for dinner, mom started to worry.

When she didn't return at our bedtime, mom started to panic.

I will rather not tell what happened afterwards. Just know that they found little Lucy with the help of the police. She spend a long time in the hospital, recovering from multiple wounds and after some time she did come home. But she woudn't celebrate Christmas with us anymore.

Not next day, not next week, not ever.

Because the next morning two pairs of socks were waiting under the potted plant. Green for me, mustard for my brother. And for Lucinda...

There were little legs under the begonia plant. Little legs with tiny purple sandals still intact.
