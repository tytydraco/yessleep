Lately i have started to feel like i am being watched while i am trying to sleep.

A little before christmas in 2025. I was sleeping and i woke up and opened my eyes. I feel weird, i feel like I am being watched. I look around the room which is completely dark. Suddenly the door to the room opens. The lights are on but very dimmed, I see a tall black human looking figure standing there looking at me.

Let me give you guys a little information about this house I was staying in. Everyone that has been there feel like something weird in their presence. They think it's the man's wife who has passed that is still around that house. My grandma has always had a argument with this woman. And she can't stand going up to the 2nd floor without starting to feel heavy, like something is angry at her. My sister who does not really believe in this type of stuff startet to feel heavy when she stood next to my grandma. We all laughed and thought nothing of it really. This happened like 8 hours before I went to bed and had this weird encounter.

I woke up and didn't think much of it really. I tell my mom 2 days later while I joke about it. I did not think much about this for the rest of the day.

I went to bed again later that evening feeling quite exhausted the day after Christmas. I fell asleep quite fast.. I wake up again, almost pitch black in the room, the door was enough open to light a little light into the room enough for me to see this same black person figure sitting in the sofa 2-3 meters in front of the bed looking straight ahead, not at me but at the wall. I start to freak out a little as this seems to start to be a re- occurrence now. I close my eyes same thing as I did the first time. I fall asleep again, quite fast and don't wake up again until the morning. 

I keep what happened that night to myself for some time, until my mom and I go visit an old friend of hers. We arrive at her friend's house and immediately feel weird as soon as I enter this house. My mom and her friend are sitting on the sofa catching up while I play with her dog. And for some reason I don't remember we started to talk about the experiences I had those nights.

My mom's friend, shows us a video of her dog barking at the wall, while nothing is there on the video. I have heard that animals, especially dogs can in some cases see stuff us humans can't. This kinda freaks me out as I knew something was wrong when I entered the house. 

She also showed a video of this dog toy on a shelf that has a motion sensor, it starts to flash multiple colors if it's being touched. The ball was atleast 2 meters of the floor, on a shelf flashing all these colors. After watching these videos I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. We left that house 20-30 minutes after.

I sleep trough that night without no problems. Let's jump ahead until the next night.

I went to bed at around 10PM. And I once again wake up in the night, but this time the room is completely dark, but again I feel really weird and feel like something is watching me. Some time go by and I feel the bed moving a little like something got in the bed with me. I feel like someone is right behind me.

The feeling I had is when someone is way to close to you and you start to feel extremely uncomfortable. Let's just say I was really uncomfortable and I would also say I was really scared. Some how I fall asleep and sleep trough the night. This was the last sleep I was going to get I this house before driving all the way home again (7-8 hour drive).

It felt like each time i had these experiences, it came closer and closer and closer and closer. Like it was out to get me. Luckily I have not experienced this again yet, but I am afraid I will sooner or later.

After these experiences I have not had any more figures looking at me, but I still feel like I am being watched and/or very uncomfortable while I am trying to sleep.

Am I going crazy or is this some sort of SP? ( Sleep Paralysis )

I would love to hear your thoughts to this.
