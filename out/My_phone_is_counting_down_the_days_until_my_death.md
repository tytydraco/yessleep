My phone did something last month that I didn’t think phones could do.  
It made a memory of a day that hadn’t happened yet.

You know those automatic albums that pop up—“On this day, three years ago”? This one slid into my lock screen at 6:04 a.m.: **“1 month from now.”**

I opened it half awake, thumb clumsy, expecting some glitch with the date stamp. The photo bloomed full screen: my face. Same bedroom. Same thin winter light through my blinds. The front-facing camera had caught me staring straight at it, eyes wide and wet, mouth yanked into a long grimace like someone had hooked my cheeks with fishing line and pulled. Something darker than the room pooled behind me. It wasn’t a shadow cast on the wall; it had depth. It bulged forward, slick and ridged, like tar stretched over bone.

Two hand-shapes pressed from inside that darkness—one over my mouth, one over my forehead. The fingers were too long. The thumb across my upper lip had an extra joint, a knuckle where there shouldn’t be one. Where skin should wrinkle, the blackness creased like melted plastic. The photo was sharp, cruelly honest, as if the lens had been cleaned by something patient.

Underneath: **June 11, 6:04 a.m.**

That was exactly one month ahead.

I stared so long my eyes burned. Then I did the normal, rational things. I checked the date on my phone. I restarted it. I looked for editing apps, malware, anything. I hadn’t installed a new app in ages. There was nothing. The album remained, labeled with a smug little script: **“Relive your moments.”**

I put the phone face down and tried to laugh at myself. Then I picked it up again and zoomed in. The dark finger on my mouth wasn’t quite touching. It hovered, an almost-kiss. The other hand cupped my forehead, angled like it was testing the shape of my skull, measuring where to press.

I didn’t go to work that day. I texted my team lead some lie about food poisoning, deleted it, then sent it anyway. Every time I looked up at my wall, I saw the photo version, the black behind me swelling like a tide held back by glass.

The next morning, at 6:04 a.m., a new album appeared: **“29 days from now.”**

I held my breath before opening it. Same room, same angle, same me. But the hands had moved. The one at my mouth had turned its palm inward, like it was ready to smother. You could see where the blackness lipped around the edges of my face, how it stole the little highlight along my cheekbone and drank it. The hand on my forehead was spread wide now, as if palming a basketball, fingers framing my temples. The darkness around the shape was textured—pitted, cratered. I thought of burned bread. I thought of frostbite. I thought of old rubber left in the sun.

Underneath: **June 11, 6:04 a.m.**

I didn’t tell anyone. How do you tell someone your phone is sending you postcards from an ambush?

Day by day, the albums kept coming. **28 days. 27.**  
Every morning at 6:04, the screen pulsed awake like a heartbeat. If I ignored it, the thumbnail shook gently until I tapped. The shadow hands tightened, repositioned, learned. On **25 days**, the mouth-hand pressed down enough to fold my top lip. On **23**, the forehead hand crooked a finger and pressed the soft spot above my brow where headaches hatch.

I started sleeping with the lights on. I installed a second lamp beside the first. I duct-taped a mirror over the bedroom window because in certain moonlight the glass turned black and I couldn’t breathe. I checked my closet three times a night even though I knew—as surely as I knew the new albums would arrive—that the thing in the photo didn’t need a closet to hide in.

I downloaded a camera timestamp app to see if the system had been manipulated. Nothing. I switched phones with a coworker for a day; the album still arrived on mine. We swapped SIMs; the album still arrived on mine. She stopped meeting my eyes after that.

By **19 days**, I had started to notice something else: I looked more tired in the photos than I felt. The me in the picture grew gray around the edges, like the dark bled into the pixels of my skin. The sclera of my eyes wasn’t white; it was a deep pearl shot through with hairline cracks. The hands had more definition too. You could see lines on the palm, not normal lines but gullies—channels carved by something corrosive that had flowed thousands of times.

On **16 days**, I tried taking a photo at 6:04 a.m. before the album arrived, half superstitious, half desperate to verify. My camera timed out. The shutter refused to click. The screen warmed in my hand like a living thing and the album appeared anyway, overlaying everything else: **“16 days from now.”** In that one, my mouth was open under the hand. You couldn’t see teeth. You could see a throat.

I told myself there had to be a mundane explanation. A bored developer with a sick art project. A friend playing a long, horrible prank. A sleep disorder. Carbon monoxide.

I bought detectors and set them everywhere. I had my blood checked. I paid a tech guy down the hall to root through my phone like a surgeon. He handed it back with a shrug, eyes tight. “If this is a joke,” he said, “it’s not a joke I want to be inside of.”

On **12 days**, the hand on my forehead slid lower, two fingers dipping toward my eyes like a curtain about to close. The other hand had fully sealed my mouth. You could see the outline of my lips underneath it, pressed into a thin white coin. The blackness didn’t reflect light. It ate it. The rest of the room looked grainy around the edges, as if the camera’s dynamic range was failing.

People started asking if I was okay. I lied and said taxes, a move, a breakup, pick one. I stopped going out. I stopped letting anyone step inside my doorway. On **9 days**, I slept on the couch and still woke at 6:04 to the album, because the photo had changed rooms too. Eager. Attentive. Like something that learns your routes and meets you there.

The countdown gnawed at me until there was no more day, just mornings measured by a number. I started marking the wall behind the bed in pencil, a prison calendar I could see in the photos. It didn’t help. The marks thinned out, pale scratches, another evidence of how lightly I was pressing these days.

On **6 days**, the hands in the picture had rotated my head so my cheek faced the camera. There was a dent on my face where the fingers pressed. The skin wrinkled around it, a tired paper bag. The eye you could still see was glassy, iris wide, pupil like a pinhead. The caption underneath—**June 11, 6:04 a.m.**—felt less like a date and more like a promise.

On **4 days**, I tried leaving town. I drove until billboards thinned and every street had the same name—Road—and turned off before dawn in a motel where the smell of old cigarettes had soaked into the paint. I didn’t sleep. I watched the lock. At 6:04 a.m., my phone brightened the room. The album was there: **“4 days from now.”** Same me, same hands. The motel lamp in the frame made a little halo around the headboard. The darkness had crept down my neck like a turtleneck pulled by someone standing behind me. The mouth-hand’s knuckles were so sharp you could count them through the black.

On **3 days**, the album showed me with a hand inserted between my lips and my cheek. I couldn’t see where the fingers ended and my skin began. The caption font looked bolder. I know fonts don’t get bolder, but this one did.

On **2 days**, there was no mouth anymore, just the suggestion of one. The hand spread across where it had been. The other hand pressed my forehead back into the black, and the black had texture now like cobblestones under water. I stared until my eyes watered and swore—I swear—some of those stones were letters. Not letters I could read, just the idea of writing, a script that uncoiled when I wasn’t looking straight at it.

I tried smashing the phone. I put it in a towel and hit it with a hammer until the towel turned to dust. The glass splintered like ice. The screen went black, then lit up in a narrow vertical line, then died outright. I should have felt relief. I felt like I’d clubbed a dog.

At 6:04 a.m. the next morning, the dead phone vibrated in the drawer where I’d hidden it. I didn’t open it. I don’t know how it vibrated. I don’t know what battery life is in hell. I dug the drawer out with shaking hands and threw the whole thing into the dumpster behind my building, like that would cancel the appointment.

Exactly one minute later, my TV turned itself on. The smart hub had an update. A screen saver appeared: my photos. The interface did it—**relive your moments**—because everything is eager to help. And there it was, on a 50-inch display, larger than life: **“1 day from now.”**

No bed this time. No couch, no motel, no escape. The photo had been taken at the exact corner of my living room where I was standing, framed between the plant I couldn’t keep alive and the floor lamp shaped like a question mark. I was caught mid-turn, as if someone had called my name in a voice that sounded like mine. The dark shape towering behind me wasn’t a smear anymore; it was a body, tall enough to brush the ceiling, narrow enough to slide between me and every door. Its head was wrong, too elongated, too still. What I had thought were hands weren’t hands at all but mouth parts—petals of darkness folding inward with teeth that weren’t teeth but edges. Two of those petals pressed where a mouth would be on me. One cupped my skull like you would cradle a newborn.

The worst part wasn’t seeing it. The worst part was the expression on my face. Relief. Not terror. Relief, like I had been waiting a long time to stop resisting and finally someone else had come to do the holding for me.

The timestamp: **June 11, 6:04 a.m.** Tomorrow.

I unplugged the TV. It stayed on. I pulled the breaker for the living room. The screen went dark, then the screen saver found a way to still be there, low-voltage, dim as a nightlight. I threw a blanket over it. The shape on the screen pressed against the fabric and made a silhouette like something breathing.

I didn’t sleep. I sat on the floor and watched the clock on the stove inch toward 6:04, the colon blinking like a little metronome counting out a song with no melody. At 6:03, the room felt colder. The air got thick, the way it does before a storm, except there was no weather. There was just a weight, something patient leaning on the doorframe from the inside.

At 6:04, my phone rang from the dumpster. I heard it clear through the wall. The TV bloomed white. The blanket fell forward, perfectly folded, like hands had lifted it and laid it down with care.

I stood. I don’t know why. I think some part of me thought if I could meet it standing, I could keep some dignity. In the photo, future-me had looked relieved; present-me was greedy for that relief.

The darkness in the corner deepened. Not filled—deepened, as if the room had been peeled back and more room lay behind it. The thing stepped forward without moving. The floor didn’t creak. The plant didn’t sway. It just was closer. Its not-hands unfurled until the tips of whatever those were drifted over my cheeks, my brow. Cold isn’t the word. Cold is absence. This was presence, too much of it, pressure that had no temperature. I couldn’t pull air. I couldn’t blink.

A part of me thought: look at the clock, prove it’s real. Another part thought: don’t, because then it will be real. The largest part thought nothing at all. It just listened. There was a sound, like a long, low exhale that had learned to shape itself into a word without consonants.

I would like to tell you I fought. I would like to report a heroic flail, a scream. What happened is I softened. I didn’t choose it. The body chooses when the mind fails. My jaw slackened. My shoulders dropped. The thing’s petals—or hands, or whatever ancient metaphor our small mouths can’t say—settled on my face like a mother’s palm and a priest’s hand. One covered my mouth. One covered my forehead. The edges pressed in until the room narrowed to a tunnel of black threaded by a bright white line. Not a light. A seam.

I saw, in one terrible instant, every photo at once. Every morning, every angle, every tiny adjustment. I realised they were not warnings. They were practice. Not for me. For it. It had been learning the exact shape of me, the exact give of skin and cartilage, the way my fear swelled and sank at different hours, the exact spot where pressure becomes surrender.

There’s a last thing I can remember before the seam opened. It’s dumb. It’s small. It’s the plant by the lamp. I had forgotten to water it again. A browning leaf fell as the dark closed around my eyes, and I thought, stupidly, that I could catch it and press it back into place.

When I came back—if this counts as coming back—the room was quiet. The TV was off. The clock said 6:05. My phone lay on the doormat, screen spiderwebbed, showing a black background with a single white notification:

**“Relive your moments.”**

I tapped it with hands that felt like gloves. The album opened. No countdown. No future. Just one title:

**“Today.”**

The photo is me, sitting where I am now, writing this. The darkness is not behind me anymore. It is not a body with wrong hands. It’s an outline on my skin, a tint in my eyes, a bruise at my temples that doesn’t fade. It’s neat. It fits. The caption does not have a time. It doesn’t need one.

If you’ve ever looked at someone and thought, *you look petrified,* here’s a spoiler: there are worse versions than stone. Stone can be warmed. This feels like varnish laid over the living. It keeps you just as you are in the moment the hands touched you. It keeps you so you can’t rot, or change, or heal. It keeps you for later.

The album refreshed while I typed. A second “Today.” In this one, I’m smiling. Not with my mouth. With the rest of me. Like the photo knows I finally understand the use of a memory: it isn’t to remember the past.

It’s to hold still for what’s coming.
