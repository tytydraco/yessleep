She was beautiful. I know people say that isn't the first thing you should think about someone, but it was hard not to notice. 

Our meeting was like something right out of a romantic comedy. Both of us frequented our local farmers market, apparently, but neither of us used social media all that much, so you could imagine our surprise when both of us turned up on the usual Wednesday only to find nothing but an empty parking lot. 

And each other, I guess. 

I had been going to get back into my car, disappointed, when she jogged up to me, raising a hand to wave. 

"Hey, you!" She called out, and I stopped to wait for her. 

Most people probably would have been out of breath, but she wasn't. Her brown hair skewed slightly orange, like how a cat's fur might reflect in the sunlight, and it was long and full and curled, hanging down to her waist. Her eyes were an equally enchanting shade of brown, and her nose had a little silver hoop glinting from one of her nostrils. Her smile was wide and genuine.

She was beautiful. 

"What's going on? Where's the farmers market, did they move it?" 

I took a second to reply, embarrassingly enough. Her voice sounded how honey tasted, thick and rich and sweet. 

"I don't know, that's what I'm wondering too," I told her. My own voice sounded like grinding rocks compared to hers. Like a garbage disposal. 

We checked Facebook, respectively. 

"Damn it," she muttered under her breath. She held a hand to her cheek, I assume to warm up her face, but it made her look like something out of a cartoon. I couldn't help but stare. Her nails were painted a shiny dark maroon. "They moved it to tomorrow! Can you believe that?" 

I fought back a stupid grin. "Will you survive without your...?" 

She blushed, looking down at her feet, wrapping her jacket tighter around herself to combat the cold. "Leeks." 

"Leeks!" I exclaimed, sandwiching my head between my hands. "My god! Will you make it through the night?" 

She was smiling at me again. I felt like I would do anything to keep that look on her face forever. 

"I don't know. I might need some company. Just in case." 

She told me her name was Amber. 

*Amber*. Isn't that perfect? I had never met anyone in my life who suited a name more. 

I told her my name was Ty. She asked what it was short for, and I told her some things had to remain a mystery, mostly just so that she would want to see me again to find out... which was stupid, but I guess it worked. 

We met the next day at the same time in the same parking lot, this time for the real farmers market. She bought her leeks and I found the bread I wanted, and after that we just wandered around, chatting and people watching idly. 

It was immediately extremely comfortable between us, like we had known each other for years. She was wearing a long purple coat that day, and I kept having to resist the urge to slide my cold hands into the pockets, as if that would be an okay thing to do with a virtual stranger. 

I found out she lived alone in a studio apartment downtown. I found out she had a cat named Buddy, and I told her that was so weird, because I had a dog named Buddy too. This made her laugh in a way that made my heart briefly stop, and I physically had to look away from her so she wouldn't be able to tell. 

"Are we both equally that boring?" 

"Guess so." 

We realized after a while we had wandered away from the market and were now walking along the river. We ducked into a bar and got a couple drinks, and that was when I first heard about her ex. 

"I like you," she had said, nursing her Stella, running her fingertip along the rim of the bottle. "I hope that isn't too forward." 

My smile was probably too big and too stupid, but in that moment I couldn't care. "I like you too. I'm glad we're hanging out." 

We fell into comfortable silence for a moment before I spoke again. 

"I guess I should be honest," I mumbled, bringing my own beer to my mouth, taking a swig before continuing. "I recently got out of a relationship." 

I saw surprise flash in her brown eyes, and she tilted her head slightly. "How recently?" 

I winced. "Couple weeks... but, listen, I'm not looking for a rebound or whatever," I stammered. "No, wait, that sounded wrong... what I mean is... I don't want, like, some kind of fling to get over her or whatever... I'm looking for..." 

"Something real?" She finished for me. I realized she was nodding. "Ty, it's okay. I understand. I just got out of a relationship too." 

I frowned, giving her a curious glance. "Yeah?" 

"Yes." She reached out, giving my hand a light squeeze. It made my stomach flip. Jesus, I felt like a middle schooler with my first crush. "Recently." 

"How recently?" I teased. 

"A couple of days." 

I went stiff, my throat closing, making me almost choke on my beer. She sighed, leaning back in her chair. 

"I'm not, like... I don't know, Ty, I don't want you to think I'm a bad person or apathetic or anything. It's just... we weren't very good for a long time. I think I was already sort of detached before it officially ended. I've been detached at least since last winter, if I'm honest." 

I nodded slowly, watching her face. She wasn't looking at me. This subject definitely seemed a little touchy. 

"That makes sense..." 

It wasn't like I hadn't been there before, or that I couldn't understand. I just felt like I had to be cautious... if I got involved with someone, it had to be done right. Maybe it was hypocritical, but I really didn't want to be dating someone who was still hung up on an ex, because she had met me DAYS after they broke up. It just felt... wrong. Even if she really was detached. 

"Oh no, I'm scaring you away..." She groaned, hiding her face in her hands for a moment, resting her elbows on the table. 

"No, it's just..." 

She parted her fingers like a shy child, meeting my eyes from between them. "Listen, I totally get it if you don't want to see me again after this. I just want you to know that my ex was... bad. And being here, with you... this is the first time I've actually felt really safe and excited with someone for a very long time." 

I hesitated, chewing on my bottom lip. "Really...?" 

I wanted to ask how her ex was so bad. It would have been intrusive, but I should have asked if he hit her, or yelled at her, or put her in shady situations. I really, really should have. But I didn't. 

She nodded, smiling at me hopefully. I sighed and reached out, lightly squeezing her hand like she had with mine only moments before. 

"I'd like to see where this goes," I said finally, quietly. She had to lean in to hear me over the country music playing from the jukebox in the corner. "And I'd like to hang out again. I just don't want anything too complicated right now." 

She nodded again, leaning even closer than she had to. 

"Nothing too complicated. Promise." 

We saw each other again about a week later. 

I had spent those days trying, to no avail, not to get too excited. I didn't want to move too fast, especially considering the circumstances... and I was ashamed to say I felt sort of guilty, too. I imagined my ex girlfriend, Sara, seeing me out with some new girl only about a month after we broke up, and it made me feel like a bad person. 

That night, while Amber mined garlic and I rinsed some vegetables for her, I asked her if she felt the same way. She laughed quietly at this. 

"No," she said, as if the answer was obvious somehow. "My ex wouldn't see us." 

This answer perplexed me. It brought forth a flurry of new questions, all of which hovered at the back of my tongue, unable to escape. 

Did her ex go to jail? Was he in jail now? Or did he just move somewhere...? 

Had their breakup been so bad that he'd had to *move?* 

Again, I should have pushed it. But, again, I didn't. I didn't want to mess this thing with her up. 

We ate the dinner we'd made on her couch, which was actually her bed, just folded up. I met Buddy, who seemed to like me a lot. After we ate we put on a movie, and halfway through, I was leaning down to her level and kissing her. 

"Careful," she whispered against my mouth, her hands on my shoulders. "You're making it complicated." 

She tasted like garlic and strawberry lip gloss. It was the best kiss of my life. 

After that, it just fell together. 

It became our routine to go to the farmers market every Thursday and then get a drink after, but as the city got colder and the leaves turned a shade closer to her hair color, the farmers market ended. Instead we just walked... people always talk about the weight you gain when you get into a relationship, but in my case, I think I lost it. We would walk six or seven miles and I would barely notice, I would barely break a sweat as long as she was there distracting me. 

She was an event planner, which I pointed out was a very vague title, which made her laugh. She volunteered a lot on the side, so she was often busy. I squeezed in time with her during her hours off, somewhere between when she could and when I was away from my stupid tech internship (which was also, to be fair, an almost equally vague title to have). 

One weekend, I asked her to go out with my friends and I. 

This felt like a step. For some reason I had been nervous all day, and my fingernails had been chewed to shreds. Several times I had to remind myself that I wasn't asking her to marry me, just to get some drinks, and I absolutely had to calm down. 

She agreed, wrapping her arms around my neck and kissing me deeply. 

"As long as you'll be there." 

"It would be a little weird if I wasn't, wouldn't it?" 

We all met at a pub that was fairly close to my apartment. My roommate, Nick, was there with his girlfriend, Clara, as well as a couple of our other friends, some from our jobs and some from college. It ended up being a larger group than I expected. 

When I saw them all inside through the window, I stopped for a second. I couldn't get rid of that anxious feeling. Amber stopped too, and she gently rubbed my back, making small circles. 

"Hey," she said softly, leaning to look me in the eye. "It'll be good, Ty. They'll love me, I'm delightful." 

She laughed, and I laughed too, but that wasn't it. I couldn't explain what the problem was. Something just felt off, like something very bad was going to happen. I couldn't place it, so I tried to let it go. 

My friends did love her, just as predicted. She was extremely charming. We all had a great time, joking around and ordering rounds of drinks, taking turns playing pool and darts and skee-ball. It would have been a lovely evening, I'm sure. If she hadn't gotten that call. 

One moment she was stepping away to take it and the next she was tugging at my sleeve, trying to get my attention, her face shrouded with worry. 

"What's wrong? What is it?" I asked, slightly tipsy but more concerned. That same feeling of dread fell over me, and I looked around despite myself as if someone might lunge at me all of a sudden. 

"I have to go. I'm going." 

"What? Why?" 

I couldn't keep the disappointment out of my voice. She gave me a look that I had a feeling I was supposed to understand, but I didn't. It was a look of shame. 

Before I could ask her anything else, she was gone, disappearing into the crowd. 

That was the beginning of our first fight. 

She didn't answer me at all for the rest of the night, even when I (drunkenly) called multiple times in a row. She didn't answer the next day, either. By Tuesday, I started to feel worried about her safety. 

On Wednesday, she showed up at my door. I let her in, my mind racing. I wasn't sure how to handle this... I didn't want to stop seeing her, but I was upset and confused over this, and I didn't know how she was going to react to that. 

We both stood there in silence for a little while. Her hair was up that day, tied into a ponytail. I tried not to admire it. 

"You really upset me," I blurted out finally, in a sort of hiss so Nick wouldn't hear me from his room. "I had to explain to everyone why you split, and it was one thing that you left, but then you totally ghosted me. I didn't even know if you were okay." 

She nodded, looking down at her feet. She had taken off her shoes, and she was wearing socks with little daffodils on them. It made it kind of hard to feel angry. 

"I know." 

I hesitated. "*Are* you okay?" 

She nodded, shrugged, and nodded again. Finally she looked up, meeting my eyes. "I'm so sorry, Ty. It was... a work thing. Something came up. And then I was too embarrassed to text you..." 

It was a lame excuse, and I knew it. I hated it, I didn't want it to be true, but I didn't believe her. What made me more upset than the way she was acting was the fact that it was happening in the first place, breaking up our perfect little honeymoon phase. 

"An event planning emergency?" I scoffed. "Really?" 

She frowned at me. "Yeah..." 

"What kind of event needs planning at midnight, Amber?" 

Her frown deepened and she crossed her arms, turning to point her body away from me. "A funeral, okay?" 

That made me pause. I shook my head, taken by surprise. "What do you mean a funeral?" 

"I don't plan events like parties, Ty. I plan funerals. I work at a funeral home. Someone wanted me there, it was... I don't know, it was personal. Okay?" 

I blinked. "Why wouldn't you just tell me that?" 

She shrugged loosely, biting her lip. "I don't know..." 

It certainly wasn't a sufficient answer, but in that moment, it was good enough for me. I wouldn't have admitted it then, but I was desperate enough for it to work out that I would have overlooked anything. Pathetic, I know. 

I wrapped her up in my arms and squeezed. She hugged me back, relaxing against me. 

"Just tell me next time. Okay?" 

She nodded, pressing her face into my neck. 

"I will. I promise." 

It got worse slowly... slowly enough that I didn't fully realize it was happening until it was too late. 

We saw each other less, but when we did, it was more intense. She would be all over me like she was taking as much of me in as she could, and then she would rush off again. Sometimes she would lock herself in the bathroom with her phone for hours at a time. She never left her phone anywhere with me, actually, and if it was, it was turned over with the screen facing down. 

I could have confronted her about any of these things, but I actively tried to ignore them. I still really liked her, and it still felt like she liked me too. But the fear crept up on me when I least expected it, nagging at me persistently. Something wasn't right about her. 

It wasn't just the suspicion that she was cheating. It was something else, too. This heavy dread followed me around, this strange prickle at the back of my neck... it was worse when I was alone, so I tried not to be alone very often. 

It came to a head when one night I finally got her to sleep over. While she was half asleep, pressed against me, a thought came to me: 

What was the name of her ex? Had I ever even asked? 

"Babe?" I whispered into the darkness. 

For a second I thought she was asleep, because she didn't answer right away. 

"Yeah?" She whispered back finally, her voice heavy and weighed down by sleep. 

"Your ex... what's his name? I guess I never asked." 

In that moment it occurred to me she had never actually called her ex a 'he'. 

I expected her to ask why I was asking, but she never did. She was quiet for a long time. So long that I lay my head down, and I closed my eyes, giving up on getting an answer. 

"I'm not supposed to say its name," she said. "You can ask it yourself." 

When I opened my eyes, the darkness seemed to close over me. I felt like I could feel it filling up my nose, my mouth, my throat, choking me, pushing out every bit of air. 

When I turned towards her she was still facing away from me, her arm outstretched and pointing somewhere across the room. Something wasn't right, something in the way it was so straight it looked bent. 

When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't remember when I had fallen asleep. The room felt peaceful again, and it glowed with the warm morning light from the windows. The only proof I had of my panic attack was the aching exhaustion I felt, the exhaustion that seeped all the way down to my bones. 

Maybe it really was a dream. But if it was, it hadn't been a normal one. 

Amber was asleep next to me, facing me now. Her long brown-orange hair almost covered her entire pillow. 

And then it hit me. Her phone sat on the bedside table, screen facing down but otherwise completely unprotected. 

I knew I shouldn't, but I told myself the only way to move forward was to know. She wasn't going to explain any of her strange behavior, that much was abundantly clear. 

I climbed out of bed, careful not to move the duvet too much in the process. I crept around to her side, slowly picking up her phone and turning it over. 

The screen lit up. She had a lot of notifications, some from as recent as seconds ago, but without her password, I couldn't see what they were. For a moment I panicked, but then something occurred to me... I typed it in in number form, B U D D Y. 

And then I was in. 

I opened up her calls first. There were hundreds of recent calls, both accepted and missed, from various unsaved numbers... but most of them were from a contact that looked blank, like it was coming from no one at all. There were outgoing calls to this number too, over and over and over again, some being made only minutes apart. 

I clicked on and opened up that contact: nothing was there. It looked like a contact page, but there was no name, no number, nothing, like before you fill one out. 

I opened up her voicemails. Lots of those, too... I assumed as many as a phone could carry in storage. I clicked on the most recent one from the empty contact, holding it up to my ear so I wouldn't have to turn it up high enough for Amber to hear. My heart was hammering in my chest. 

It was completely silent. 

I went to her texts. Hundreds of messages from different people... I scanned some of them, my stomach twisting uncomfortably. 

*Hey baby how r u?* 

*Hey Rachel are we still on later for dinner or are you busy 2nite*

*Love you too*

*Hi Elsie its me John*

She wasn't just cheating on me. She nearly had a cult. She was even using different names...

None of these men had contacts saved, and I nearly started to cry when I found my own, also unsaved, with my most recent message: *Almost here?*  

Then I saw the blank one. The one that had no name. I opened their messages, blinking back tears. 

*COMING* 

*COMING* 

*COMING* 

*COMING*

*COMING*

*COME HERE*

*COME HERE*

*MY LOVE*

*MY QUEEN*

*DO IT* 

*DO IT*

*DO IT* 

*DO IT* 

*DO IT* 

*NOW*

*COME*

I shivered. It wasn't how anyone texted another person, it was deeply wrong. It didn't look like she ever replied, but sometimes whoever it was would react to something with a *YES* or a *NO*, which alarmed me even more. 

I was scrolling through the endless messages when a call popped up, and my shaking fingers accidentally accepted it. 

I can't describe the sound. It was like a thousand different sounds all at once, all mashed together, like a hellish orchestra. It was piercing, despite the volume on the phone being turned nearly all the way down. I have never heard, and will never hear, anything like it ever again. 

But somehow, despite the cacophony of noise, there were words. Words coming from a voice that sounded like a million ants building their nest in my eardrums. A voice that sounded like a building burning, the people inside choking on smoke. A voice like an IV drip. 

"*COM...ING*." 

Amber was awake then, and she was yanking the phone from my stiff hand. Somehow I still expected something, some kind of excuse or some kind of apology, but she just looked at me in horror, tears welling up in her eyes. 

"What did you just do? What the fuck did you do?" 

I'm in the bathroom now, locked inside. Amber says it won't do much, but it might give her time. 

Time for what, I have no idea. 

I prayed for a while. It didn't feel like it was helping much. I think whatever this is might be out of God's domain. 

So now I'm telling you. Sorry. 

It has been hard to get it all down, mostly because I keep getting phone calls. I didn't answer the ones from the blank contact, obviously... but I answered one of the ones from my mom. I hung up when I realized I wouldn't be able to get her to stop screaming. 

I can feel it coming. It's something I can feel under my skin, like an itch. It feels like the fear from a nightmare, only tangible. Mind numbing, insanity inducing fear. I hear footsteps echoing in my head like deep claps of thunder. I hear the ants building their nest, faster and faster as it gets closer. 

And now... 

Now Amber, or whatever her real name is (call me crazy, but I'm starting to think I might know it, I think I might have read it in a book somewhere), is pleading outside, I can hear her, but I don't hear any response. 

There's nothing else to say. 

It's here.
