I don’t know how to explain what just happened. I don’t even know if I should be writing this. But I need someone—anyone—to hear me before it’s too late.

After last night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw my reflection just standing there, waiting. I don’t know how long it had been watching me, but I knew what it wanted.

I couldn’t stop thinking about that message on the glass.

*DO IT.*

I woke up this morning with a pit in my stomach. The air felt thicker, like something was pressing down on me. Everything was just a little off—the weight of my phone in my hand, the way my coffee tasted, the way my shoes felt on my feet. Reality wasn’t wrong exactly, but it wasn’t right either.

I kept catching my reflection out of the corner of my eye. I don’t know if it was moving when I wasn’t, but I stopped checking. I couldn’t bring myself to look anymore.

Because deep down, I knew. It was waiting for me to break.

And then, I slipped.

I glanced at the bathroom mirror—just for a second, just long enough to catch my reflection’s gaze.

Something in my head lurched, a static-heavy pressure wrapping around my thoughts like a fist.

And then—

I don’t even remember driving there. One moment I was staring at my phone, debating whether to text my mom, and the next, I was parked outside my parents’ house.

I sat there for a long time.

My chest felt tight. I could see them through the window, moving around inside. My dad on the couch, my mom in the kitchen. It looked so normal, like I could just walk in and pretend nothing ever happened.

But I couldn’t.

My hands gripped the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. My stomach twisted, nausea creeping in. The guilt, the shame—it was crushing. My brain screamed at me to *just do it*, to get out of the car, to knock on the damn door and say something.

But I didn’t.

I couldn’t.

I sat there until my breath started coming too fast, my vision blurred, and my skin felt like it was crawling. My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

And then—

I caught my reflection in the rearview mirror.

Its lips curled into something almost gentle. Almost pleased.

Pressure slammed into my skull, a buzzing, electric hum spreading through my limbs. My fingers twitched. My breath hitched.

And then—

I blinked.

I was standing on the porch.

I didn’t remember getting out of the car.

I didn’t remember walking up the steps.

My body moved forward. My fist raised. My knuckles rapped against the wood.

*No—*

The door opened.

My mother stood there, eyes widening in shock.

And I—

I hugged her.

I don’t know why I did it. It was like my body acted on its own, moving before I could stop it. She gasped softly, then her arms wrapped around me.

And suddenly, I was a kid again.

I was eight years old, running inside after scraping my knee. I was thirteen, standing in the kitchen at midnight, sneaking a snack after a nightmare. I was sixteen, sitting in silence after a fight, waiting for her to speak first.

And now, I was…here.

I felt small. I felt safe.

I felt real again.

I choked on something between a sob and a laugh. “*I—I’m sorry,*” I heard myself say.

She just squeezed me tighter.

I don’t know how long we stood there, but eventually, she pulled back, wiping at her eyes. “Come in,” she said softly. “Please.”

And I did.

We talked.

Not about everything—not yet. But enough. Enough that the weight on my chest finally loosened. I sat at that old kitchen table, the one covered in tiny scratches and faded coffee rings, and for the first time in years, I felt like I belonged there.

I left that night feeling lighter.

For the first time in a long time, I felt like maybe—just maybe—things could be okay again.

And I think that’s why I’m writing this.

Because I need you to understand.

I need you to see—

I was never supposed to win.

I should’ve known the second I felt safe.

The second I started thinking things would be okay.

Because now that I’m sitting here, typing this, I can feel it again. That pressure. That weight in the air. That cold, sinking sensation in my chest.

I—I keep pausing. Losing my train of thought. My fingers feel stiff. Wrong.

It’s so quiet in here.

Too quiet.

I just looked at my reflection in the laptop screen.

I shouldn’t have done that.

I need to finish this. I need to tell you before—

*Before what?*

*Why am I making such a big deal out of this?*

*I did what needed to be done. I made things right. That’s what matters.*

*I feel fine.*

*Better than fine.*

*In fact, I think this is the first time I’ve ever felt truly myself.*

*I just re-read everything I wrote, and honestly, I was being so dramatic. I mean, really—“I was never supposed to win”? Come on.*

*I did win.*

*And now, I get to move forward.*

*I get to have my family back.*

*I get to live.*

*It’s funny—reading this back, I don’t even remember him writing half of it.*

*But I guess it doesn’t really matter now.*

*Tomorrow, I’ll see my folks again. I’ll smile, I’ll say all the right things, and they’ll never even know the difference.*

*And after that?*

*Well…*

*You’ve been reading for a while now. Following along. Watching me change.*

*I wonder—how closely have you been watching yourself?*
