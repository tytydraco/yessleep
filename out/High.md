It was supposed to be the best night of his life. His first high. He’d heard all the stories, seen all the memes, watched the movies. He was ready. The weed had kicked in just right—smooth, slow, like everything was blooming, like time was stretching out just for him. He couldn’t stop smiling. Everything felt perfect. The hum of the world seemed to sync with the beat of his heart. 

He was floating.

He took out his phone, thinking about texting his friends, maybe taking a picture, maybe sharing his moment with the world. But then… *crack*. 

His screen shattered.

It wasn’t even the loud sound that got to him. It was the *suddenness*. The small piece of glass lying like a jagged puzzle piece in the palm of his hand, an unexpected sharpness in a sea of smooth, fuzzy euphoria. For a moment, it didn’t even register. He looked at the broken screen, the spiderwebbed cracks that spread out like a web across his thoughts. 

He laughed at first. He *had* to. What else could he do?

But then, like a quiet whisper, the weight of it all settled in. He’d ruined something so small—just a screen, a piece of plastic, and yet, for him, it felt huge. He’d never been good with things like this. It was a stupid mistake, a failure.

Suddenly, the high wasn’t so perfect. 

He dropped the phone on his bed, rubbing his eyes. The high was still there, but it wasn’t the same. It felt distant now, like he was separated from it, just out of reach. And that’s when the voices started. Not the loud, obvious ones. No. These were quieter. So much quieter.

“*You always ruin everything.*”

His heart skipped a beat. He froze. He knew that voice. 

It was *him*. 

The voice of his insecurities—the little failures, the doubts, the “what ifs” that always trailed him. It was like a shadow, something that always followed him around, waiting for moments like this. He tried to shake it off, but the voice kept pushing, prodding at his mind.

“*You’ve never been good enough, have you?*” it whispered. “*You’ll never be good enough.*”

The high didn’t feel fun anymore. He started spiraling, each insecurity bigger than the last, each mistake louder. That feeling of floating? Gone. It was like he was falling. The darkness crept in, a slow, suffocating presence that started to pull him down. 

“*Why do you even bother?*” the voice continued. “*You’ve always messed things up, and you’ll keep messing things up. It’s only a matter of time before everyone leaves you behind.*”

The cracks in his phone screen weren’t just on the glass. They were in his mind. He could feel them, those tiny little fractures, those places where he’d always felt not enough. The failed relationships. The jobs he couldn’t keep. The friendships that faded. The mistakes that built up, one on top of the other.

And the voice—his own voice, the voice that had been with him since childhood—kept echoing louder and louder.

“*You can’t fix it. You can’t fix anything. You don’t deserve to be happy.*”

His breath started to get shallow. His chest tightened. His hands started shaking. He was suffocating—*literally* suffocating, as if the weight of his mistakes was pressing in from all sides. It was too much. The voice was too much.

He stumbled to the window, desperate for some air, desperate for the feeling of being somewhere, anywhere, *away* from this mind. He needed something. *Anything.*

“*You’ve never mattered to anyone,*” the voice hissed. “*They’re all just waiting for you to fall.*”

The ground below looked so far away. The streetlights blurred like distant stars. He stood there for what felt like an eternity, his hand on the windowsill, his heart racing, feeling like he could just… let go.

But then, something stopped him.

It wasn’t a voice. It wasn’t a feeling. It wasn’t some deep wisdom that came from within. It was just a *moment*. A flicker. A second of clarity. 

He remembered something—something so small, but it was enough.

His mom’s laugh. His brother’s stupid jokes. His friends, the ones who always stuck around no matter how messed up he was. He remembered the way they looked at him, not with judgment, but with *love*. 

He remembered that he wasn’t alone. Even if he felt like it, even if his head was full of echoes and doubts—there were people who would miss him. People who wanted him here. And *he* wanted to be here, too. 

The voice in his head screamed louder, desperate to drag him back into the dark, but this time, it was quieter. Distant. He turned away from the window. Slowly. Tentatively.

“I don’t have to do this,” he whispered, almost as if saying the words would make them true. 

The room felt a little smaller now, a little safer. He turned back to the bed, where his phone lay—broken, useless, but it didn’t matter anymore. He was still breathing. His heart was still beating.

His body still had a future.

And so did he.

He collapsed onto the bed, eyes still wet from tears he hadn’t even realized he was crying. He let the high come back slowly, like a slow tide, not the same as before, but still there—soft, comforting, like the faint glow of a distant sunrise. He didn’t need to be perfect. He didn’t need to fix everything. He didn’t need to be the guy who always got it right. 

He just needed to be *here*. 

He wasn’t going to let the voice win. Not tonight. 

The phone could wait. The cracks would heal in time. 

He could make it through this. 

*Maybe* this time, he would.
