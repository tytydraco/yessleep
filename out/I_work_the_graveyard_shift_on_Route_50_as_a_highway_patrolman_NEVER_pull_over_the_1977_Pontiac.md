It was just like any other night. I'm sitting in the patrol car, looking out into the night with a cigarette in my left hand, and my elbow rested on the bottom of the open window. I work in a pretty empty area, Route 50 is already known as one of the loneliest roads in the US, but I was stationed in central Nevada, so you can imagine how many cars I saw in a night. My job is to stare at black paint and report any changes.

I've worked this post for a few months now. I'm interning for the Highway Patrol, so naturally they put me in charge of the most out of the way road in the area. I've never complained about my post though, sure, It's an hours drive from my house, but my job was basically to do nothing between 10 PM and 6 AM. Besides typical police stuff, there were only two rules I had to follow, firstly, I had to keep myself illuminated at all times, make sure people know I'm there.

I thought that defeated the entire purpose of making sure people didn't speed when no one was around, but I was getting paid and hopefully a future full-time position with the patrol so I followed that rule without question. The second and final rule was the strange one, so far I haven't been given the opportunity to break it, but the patrolman in charge of showing me the ropes couldn't stress it enough:

"If you see an old Pontiac on Route 50, and you're on the graveyard shift, do not stop it. Under any circumstances. Even if the bastard was going 50 over." That was what my grizzled patrolman teacher had told me. More specifically, a Pontiac from 1977. When I inquired further as to why some Pontiac was above the law, he told me to just follow the rules and to not think about it too hard.

I always figured he was just messing with me, so I never took the rule too seriously. I almost forgot about it because I had never seen a 1977 Pontiac, let alone one breaking the law. But that changed on this night. Things started smoothly, there were a few cars that popped in and out of the Nevada void, but none that broke any speed limits when they saw me. That night it was dark, it was the kind of darkness that was all-encompassing, the kind that made it Impossible to believe the sun could suck it up come morning time.

It was 3:24 AM when I saw it escape from the black. The night suffocated me just like it suffocated the glossy black Pontiac from '77. It was a car that looked built for the night, as natural to the dark sands as scorpions and rattlesnakes. Its performance was so convincing I nearly treated it like wildlife, and the desert beauty was barreling towards me

I gathered myself and my radar gun and stepped out of my car. I clocked the machine going 120 miles an hour when it passed me accompanied by a woosh. It was going 40 over. I threw my cigarette into the black and stepped into my patrol car. I was putting the keys in the ignition when I finally connected the dots between the strange rule and the black beauty speeding away from me.

Like I said before, I figured my patrolman teacher was just messing around with me because I was an intern. The kind of car he talked about was one I had never seen in my life, the chances of one of them being on a road as lonely as Route 50 was slim to say the least. My reasoning was that because it was such a rare car he thought I wouldn't ever actually encounter one, he just wanted to put a ghost story in my head to spook me on those cold nights. Very funny.

Armed with this logic, I quickly stowed any fear I had away and turned on my siren and light, flooding the desert with sound. I tailed slowly behind the car, it took a while because the guy didn't let up on the speed for a bit. I followed the backlight of the beauty for a thousand or so feet until it slowed itself to a stop. I stopped behind it and turned off my siren.

The only thought in my mind was why the hell a guy would go that fast when I'm clearly in view. The road was empty and dark at my post, I was the only light for miles. The Pontiac driver definitely would've seen me from way farther back than I could see him. I thought he was probably just drunk or something.

I pushed my car door open and climbed out in a swift motion, I heard it shut behind me. My badge caught the backlight of the car and shined into the backseat of the Pontiac. I would be lying to say I wasn't a bit creeped out by the coincidence. Such specific and rare car appearing on such a lonely road that just so happened to be breaking the law on my patrol, but I tried my best to not let what my superior said creep me out.

I cleared my throat, ready to rip the guy a new one for going so far above the speed limit right in view of an officer. His windows weren't rolled down when I got to him, they were tinted black, and I could only see his faint outline in the guts of the car.

I tapped on the window with the tip of the radar gun I was still carrying, and signaled for him to open it. The window gracefully complied. I nearly stepped back when I saw the guy inside. He looked like an older man, in his late 40s maybe, he was balding severely and what little hair remained was slicked back with an intense amount of oil, so much that it reflected off the light in the car.

His face was the most striking part of his appearance, he looked like he was melting, I can't describe it any other way. His cheeks, and lips sagged almost like a thick liquid instead of a solid. His eyes were black and faded, his lips were chapped and one of his bushy eyebrows were missing. He looked just on the cusp of the Uncanny Valley. The worst part wasn't even his appearance, It was his smell, he absolutely reeked; and it wasn't like he smelled like shit elther; he smelled like a chemical plant, the smell was strong and absolutely repulsive. He smelled like death.

I stepped back instinctively responding to a combination of his unsightliness and his horrid smell. "Sir, what is that smell?" I asked loudly, stumbling over my words in the process. His appearance was creeping me out, and the smell wasn't like anything I'd ever smelled. All I knew was that it was terrible.

His expression didn't change. He began to open his mouth in a way that seemed unnatural, like he was consciously putting effort into the movement of his lips. His mouth opened a little too wide for speech, and I saw that that he didn't have any teeth. I looked at the man for an uncomfortable few seconds. He closed his mouth again without saying anything, not even letting out a breath. He continued staring at me with his lifeless eyes.

Something was wrong here, I could feel it, I felt terrible just looking at him. I started regretting ever pulling over this Pontiac, I should have just listened to my teacher I thought. But I stopped myself, just because the guy looked a bit weird and smelled terrible doesn't mean I'm in danger. I reluctantly proceeded with the typical pulling over speech.

"You were going 40 miles over the speed limit; I'm going to need to see your license and registration" I tried to sound confident but on the inside my heart was racing. The smell was becoming unbearable at this point, I turned around to cough, when I turned back around the man looked different... He looked normal suddenly. His hair was the same, but his eyes were now in the right place, his missing eyebrow was back, his lips weren't chapped, and he had a full set of pearly whites.

I was taken aback, I rubbed my eyes but he looked the same. An older guy sure, but not one that was out of the ordinary. Maybe I was hallucinating? But how could I hallucinate such a horribly potent smell? The man was now smiling at me. "Sure!" the man said with an overenthusiasm I had never observed from someone I pulled over. "I've got them right here!" His voice was metallic, it cut through my skin, it sounded like what gravel feels like.

I only took my eyes off him for half a second, yet there was his license and registration in his hands, he never reached into his glove box, and as far as I knew he didn't have it before. His information just appeared in his hands. His arm was overreached, and he looked elated, I had never seen a happier face. His smile looked elongated, but I still felt nothing behind his eyes, he looked like a life-sized doll. As I reached over to grab his information, I noticed something, his smile didn't stop at the normal spot. Instead, the closer my hand got to his license and registration, the wider and more unnatural his smile became.

His smile was now wider than humanely possible. I took his license, and his smile reached up to the corner of his dead eyes. As soon as it was in my hands his face began to melt away, and the horrid smell came back. It was only then that I looked down and realized the hand I took the license from was burning in pain, I further noticed that I wasn't handed a license, but instead some sort of rectangular object covered spikes that shot through my hand.

My hand was bleeding out. I yelled from the pain and dropped to the floor, clutching my bleeding hand. I looked up at the driver, who now didn't resemble anything remotely human. It exited the Pontiac, Its smile was still wide, all of its skin melted off, its eyes were hanging from its socket, and it now appeared to be skinny and freakishly tall. It looked down at me while I was on the floor. There were white burning eyes that now replaced the ones that were hanging.

The melted skin revealed a figure that was the same black as the night. Its bright white eyes illuminated the hanging eyeballs, and its white smile was now the only light I could see. One of its eyes fell off and hit my uniform with a wet splat. I screamed in pure terror, my screams reverberated off the mountains, and came back in an echo. It gripped me by the ankle hard, so hard that it felt like my bones shattered. My screams were now in response to a mixture of terror and pain.

It began walking into the road, a light appeared further down and it was dragging me straight for it. I thought it was over for me, screaming was now the only thing my soul could manage to do. I felt my holster for my gun; it was still there. I took it out fast and began shooting, it quickly turned around slicing the gun and the tip of my pointer finger in one motion. It turned back around dragging me towards the light.

What the creature hadn't realized was that I wasn't aiming at it, I aimed at the half century old Pontiac. I was going to attempt to burn the thing with the lighter I still had in my back pocket, trying to soak it with the gas in the car. But to my surprise, instead of gas pouring out from the tank, a thick red liquid began streaming from all three holes I shot into the car. The creature let out a shriek that nearly deafened me. It wasn't one that any human could make, but I easily recognized it as being one of pain. Its blood was pouring out of the Pontiac.

The creature loosened its grip on my ankle, and I agonizingly crawled over to my patrol car, the blood from my hand trailed behind me. The creature's screams only got louder, I opened the door to my patrol car and climbed in, it was still running. I floored it into the night and nearly hit the creature on the way out.

I must have traveled for at least a few miles before I stopped hearing the creature's screams. The last thing I remember from that night was losing consciousness in front of a local supermarket.

I woke up in a hospital where I stayed for a few days, they treated my broken ankle and my hand which was covered in quarter-sized holes. I was visited by an incident reporter and several other highway patrol people asking what happened. I told them I needed more time, to be honest I didn't even believe what happened was real. After leaving the hospital, I went straight to the station, I was ready to tell them what happened.

The chief and my patrol teacher took me into a room with them; I told them everything. From stopping the Pontiac to the blood that shot out of the car. Once I finished, they were both silent. I figured they didn't believe me, so I reiterated that I was telling the truth. "We believe you son" The chief explained "we're just amazed to see you alive" he was pale.

My teacher piped in, "What you encountered was a phenomenon we call the "midnight riders" in the patrol. He got up and opened a filing cabinet, he thumbed through the papers and eventually pulled out a document and put it in front of me. It was a list, my blood ran cold when I realized what it was.

It was a list of hundreds of major American highways, each had a photo of an old vehicle next to it, under each photo were the printed words "DO NOT PULL OVER". On Route 66 it was a Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle, on i-95 It was a 1967 Lamborghini Miura P400, and on Route 50, it was a 1977 Pontiac Firebird.

"They started appearing in the late 50s" The chief explained, "We received this list from the Federal Government, all highway patrols have them. When new midnight riders get discovered, we add them on the list and tell new recruits to never stop them." There was a silence, until my teacher chimed in "We don't know what they are, or where they came from, all we know is that they don't belong to this world." My teacher was now more pale than the chief "They attack at night on lonely roads, somehow, they know that if they go fast enough, their prey will come to them."

I felt like throwing up, I looked back down at my injuries, and back to them, they allowed some silence to let me take it in. After half a minute, the chief explained further.

"Son," The chief began, "you are the first person ever recorded that has survived an attack from a midnight rider. Your account will be valuable in preventing future deaths." I was stunned "And just how many people have been killed?" I asked with a shaky voice. "Since 1959" The chief explained "234 deaths have been confirmed across the country".

I stood frozen. "How do you know it was the Riders that killed those people?" I asked. The chief sat silently, looking down before replying. "Because they always disappear overnight, they're always in charge of lonely portions of highways, they always show signs of having pulled someone over, and no trace of the body is ever found."

The room felt ominous, there was an unspoken tension, I put together what I expected to hear next. "Listen," began my teacher. "Some men from the FBI are going to be here soon, they've asked us to keep you here, tell them what you told us."

After 10 minutes, several men in suits stormed into the room. I told them the story start to finish. They told me to sign some forms, and said that I couldn't tell a soul what I saw that night. In exchange for my silence I was offered a full position on the patrol.

This post is me breaking that contract, I can't keep silent anymore, these things are dangerous. I don't know if they're anywhere besides the United States. So please, If you're highway patrol, or a police officer of any kind, in any country, be careful when you see old cars speeding on lonely roads at night. You could be seeing a midnight rider luring its prey.

I don't know where these things came from, or what they are, but I do know that they are extremely dangerous. If you think you've spotted one, call your local highway patrol unit and ask to speak to the chief, the chief and the highest ranking officer are the only two in your area who know about the riders. Don't be afraid to call, they will know what you're talking about.

And please, be safe out there. Who knows what other horrors are hiding in the middle of nowhere.
