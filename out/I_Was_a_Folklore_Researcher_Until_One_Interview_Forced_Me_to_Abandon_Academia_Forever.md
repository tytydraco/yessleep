I was an academic working in the field of folk legends. The interview I conducted in the 1950s forced me to abandon academia forever.

The clouds and mist enveloped the countryside in a layer of grayness.

The late-autumn bareness of the trees and the meadows made the place look ever so ominous.

When my taxi arrived in the small town, the streets were empty. Every window was fitted with steel bars.

The tavern I was to be accommodated at was empty too. The owner seldom spoke, provided the keys to my room, and informed me that the food would be served in two hours.

As I picked up my bags and headed to the staircase, he asked me what the purpose of my visit was. I answered that I would be interviewing Lord E. Ashford this evening, the Baron who lived in an old Gothic mansion above the town.

The owner's eyes widened with fear, and he quickly excused himself to the kitchen.

Strange, I thought to myself, but my mind felt too exhausted by the ride to give it much thought. 

I retired to my quarters and slept until the knocks of the owner woke me up. He informed me that the meal would be served soon.

The lunchroom area was empty, save for an older man eating alone in the back. I introduced myself to him and asked if I could share the table with him. He happily offered me a seat.

We quickly got to talking; he was a charming and funny man, telling me stories about the town and his time growing up here. He asked about the purpose of my visit. 

When I informed him that I would be interviewing Lord E. Ashford later this evening, he almost choked on his food.

“Mr. Herring, I’ve seen what they’ve done to this town before.”

“Every year in late autumn, people lock up their houses and put bars on their doors. The streets are devoid of people. You barely see a soul out. The ones who don’t manage to barricade in time disappear.”

“Only a few ever came back, their bodies pale, not sickly, just pale. They hold their hands on their chest, babbling something about the heart. Every one of them dies in a matter of a few days.”

What he said startled me; his words and emotions seemed genuine.

“Please, Mr. Conor, I’m sure I’ll be okay. I appreciate your concerns, but I’m sure Lord Ashford wouldn’t try to hurt a renowned academic.”

Mr. Conor looked me in the eyes with worry. He let out a slow sigh.

“Mr. Herring, if you plan on venturing to that mansion, please wear this amulet.”

He took off a necklace that had a beautiful, bright stone and handed it to me.

“Thank you, Mr. Conor, I greatly appreciate it.”

I put the necklace in my pocket.

“No, Mr. Herring!” Mr. Conor almost screamed out. “Sorry, I apologize. Please put it on immediately and hide it under your shirt.”

He walked around and put the necklace around my neck and stuffed it under my shirt.

“I have to go now, Mr. Herring. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, be careful up there.”

Mr. Conor then briskly walked out of the tavern, his meal still half-eaten on the table.

I was used to people being superstitious, but this one startled me. I tried to shake off Mr. Conor’s words while I finished my meal, but the necklace dug into my neck. I was about to take it off when the tavern owner informed me that Lord Ashford’s car was waiting outside. He had the same look of worry as he had before. I quickly rushed into my room to get my notes and walked outside.

The car was a dark blacked-out limousine. Upon entering, I tried to greet the driver, but he didn’t say a word, put the car in first gear, and drove off. 

The way to the mansion was a steep switchback road with high drop-offs on each side. The man drove erratically, forcing me to grip the seat in fear. By the time I exited the vehicle, I had forgotten about my conversation with Mr. Conor.

Lord Ashford greeted me on the steps of his mansion. He was a tall man with long dark hair and pale white skin. I was unsure if the man was in his early thirties or late seventies.

His house was beautiful. It was a large structure painted black with small arched windows on the front facade. 

“Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Herring.”

He came down and shook my hand. His grip was strong, and he looked deep into my eyes.

He let me into his study, and on the way, he spoke of his many achievements. The fencing records in his youth, the business decisions that helped quintuple his family's wealth, and all the charitable donations he made to the nearby town.

“You know, Mr. Herring, you can do so much for the masses, but they will still fear you and accuse you of irrational wrongdoings. They say we drink their blood.” He paused. “How irrational, the heart is the…”

“From what I understand, this is one of the reasons for your lengthy travels. To collect my family’s history and the local legends about it, if I’m not mistaken.”

“Yes, Lord Ashford, that’s correct.”

“Well, let me start by explaining how the legends were born.”

“In the early 1700s, there had been two years of mass disappearances, or so the records claim. People in the town were getting desperate, looking for answers. The town's preacher, Mr. Conor, accused my family of being the perpetrators.“

“After one of the blacksmith’s daughters disappeared too, the people grew restless and walked up to our old mansion to set it ablaze. My family barely escaped that day.”

“It was only my grandfather who decided to return.” He pointed to a painting on a wall; the man bore a near-perfect resemblance to Lord E. Ashford. 

“He built the beautiful mansion you’re sitting in right now and hired a local militia to fight off any attempts on our lives. I’m sure the people in town tried to warn you away from me.”

“Yes, they have Lord Ashford.”

“Of course they have. Well, Mr. Herring, this was but a small introduction to our family affairs. What do you say to some Cognac before we really dive in?”

Lord Ashford didn’t wait for my answer and got up from his chair. As he walked to the alcohol shelf, his body began moving in strange ways.

A smell of copper was in the air.

“Lord Ashford, are you okay?”

“Mr. Herrrrrrinnnngggg,” his voice was now high-pitched and gurgling.

His head snapped back, his ears sharpened, his mouth widened, and a new row of sharp, beast-like teeth appeared. 

My ears rang while a wave of hot air flew around me.

The skin on his head turned gray, and his clothing ripped to reveal a muscular gray body. His eyes were dark yellow with bright red pupils. 

He let out a loud screech, knocked me to the ground, and mounted me.

I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong.

His hand punched my face.

I saw stars in front of my eyes, nearly losing consciousness.

Lord Ashford then tore into my clothing until only my shirt was left.

He stopped for a moment, listening.

His pupils dilated to the sound of my heart.

He tore through the shirt, but immediately let out a bloodcurdling scream.

The necklace from Mr. Conor now shone in a bright white light.

He covered his eyes and tried to rip it off my neck, but the light was getting brighter.

Lord Ashford got up and walked a few steps back.

“I curse you!” he screamed out.

He fell to his knees and held onto his head.

Then his body slowly began to disappear, turning into small dust particles.

It started at his hands, then his head, then the torso, until there was nothing left of him.

The window slowly opened. A cold breeze came from the outside.

The mansion was silent. 

My hands shook so badly I couldn’t stand.

At first, I couldn’t get up, but then I heard faint footsteps somewhere in the mansion.

I got up, jumped out of the window, and ran all the way back to town.

At the tavern, I urged the owner to call for a taxi immediately.

Without saying goodbye, I packed my stuff, left the town, and never returned.

When I arrived back home, I tried to examine the amulet. I brought it to my geologist friend, but he said it was only glass.

I tried to reach out to Mr. Conor, but the tavern owner said that no one with that name lives in that town.

Soon after, I had to quit my job at the university. After what I witnessed, I couldn’t continue.

Each night, I was haunted by visions of Lord Ashford.

I never told this story before out of fear, but I think the Ashfords are on my tail. A few days ago, I received a letter with their family's signature at the bottom. It was in an old Roman language I was unable to decipher. Only one word was written in plain English: “hungry”. 

I’m hiding in a roadside motel, gripping the amulet Mr. Conor gave me all those years ago.
