It's about fucking time I updated, huh? Sorry to keep you waiting. These last few days have been...interesting to say the least. Some college experience this is turning out to be. After seeing my roommate kill a stalker who was following us, she dragged me back to our dorm and into our room.  
"Amora, what the fuck was that about?" I asked her, still trying to process what I had just seen.  
"Oh nothing," Amora tried to play it go, sitting on the bed as if all was well. "You just saw two vampires fighting is all."  
"Vampires? You're a fucking vampire?!" I asked louder. This caused her to get off her bed and cover my mouth.  
She waited for a few moments, her eyes glued to the door. She turned to me and held her finger to her lips.  
"You don't want anyone freaking out, do you?" She whispered me with a giggle.   
I looked at her as her if she was out of her mind. "I'm freaking out right now!" I replied in a loud whisper.  
Amora placed a hand on my shoulder, seemingly trying as best as she could to comfort me. Truth was, as freaky as it was, I didn't need comforting. I just needed answers. Answers she told me she couldn't give me. At least not right now  
   
"I killed that guy," She said, "It's over and done with. Let's just forget about the whole vampire thing, okay roomie?"  
I couldn't believe it. First I'm stalked by some guy, and then he's killed by my roommate who turns out to be a vampire and now I can't even get any answers. I gave it and just went to bed.   
This had to be a dream. Some kind of weird dream. I went to bed and didn't have anything memory of it and I was just dreaming. That was all.  
I was able to sleep that night and then the next day classes started. I had a couple of classes with Amora and the whole time she seemed like the cheerful girl I met when I first entered my dorm room. Nothing weird had happened some far. This had me thinking I was right about everything being a dream, which relieved me. Last thing I needed was some weird fucking vampire shit happening when I was just trying to get through college.     
When I got back to my room when classes were done, I noticed Amora wasn't there. I put my stuff away and headed out to hang out with a few of my friends. When I got back, I noticed that Amora was pacing in the room. When she noticed me, she immediately stopped and said, "Oh you're back."  
"Yeah, I'm back," I chuckled. "So, how was your first day?"  
"Fine," Amora said with a nod. She was looking at me strangely. Something was off.  
"Everything alright?" I asked her.  
"Everything's fine," Amora said. That smile of here came to her face as she continued, "The first day was everything I hoped it would be! I can't wait for tomorrow!"  
The next few days for really weird. My sickeningly sweet woman who could not stop talking the first day we met barely talked to me at all. Her attention was on me, I could tell, but we didn't have any normal conversations. I wasn't too bothered by it at first. It's not like we were close or anything but then I noticed that she would stare at me during our classes. When I would walk to other classes, I could feel eyes on me and I knew it was her.  
I tried asking her about it that first day but she just dodged the question, talking about how her day was fine. First college was the day thing ever to her and now it was just fine. A couple of days after that, I went out again. I came back and saw a crumbled-up piece of paper in the garbage. I was curious so I picked it up.  
"What the hell?!" I was freaked out to see what looked to be a picture of me sleeping. She wasn't the best artist but it wasn't hard to tell what this was supposed to be.  
I was officially freaked the fuck out. What the hell was this girl's problem?   
I stood at the door with a glare on my face, just staring at it and waiting for her to come in at any moment so I can let her have it. I was going to see what the ruck had gotten into her.   
But she didn't come and I ended up falling asleep on my bed after a while. I must've been out for a good couple of others.  
When my eyes opened up, it was still the middle of the night. They wandered around for a bit before I looked up.  
There was a silhouette. Someone was standing over me watching me as I slept. Was this Amora?   
It didn't matter. What mattered was that I was just gonna ducking lay there and this person possibly do who knows what to me.  
I saw them going down a me just as I was about to get up. I saw fangs and that was it. I swing my fist up and it landed on their face. I got up and tackled them to the ground.  
I quickly turned the light on, and even though I suspected it, I still couldn't believe it. It was fucking Amora.  
My roommate sat up and glared at me. "Where the hell is she? What have you done with her?!"  
"What the hell are you talking about?!" I yelled at her. She didn't say anything. She just lodged at me and I grabbed her and threw her into the wall. I went and grabbed a rope I had brought with me and tied her up quickly before she could get up.  
I don't know what the fuck is going on. But I'm getting answers.
