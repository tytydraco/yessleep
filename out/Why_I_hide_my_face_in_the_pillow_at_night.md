We have all done it.  We look up at the ceiling at the end of the day or when we are resting and see shapes in the ceiling.  Sometimes animals or people, whatever we see, they are archetypical creatures;  Sometimes wizards, other times cheetahs or lions.  I would stare off when there was nothing to do and fall asleep at night.  I wanted to go to sleep on purpose as a kid.  I wasn’t tired, I was afraid.

Growing up I lived in a small rental unit.  It was just me and my mom.  I have to hand it to her that she made sure I studied and made sure I was active in sports.  But it was the two of us.  She would work and  I would ride around town in my bike.  Whether it was to school or volleyball practice I made it.  It was tough but we made it, until Milton came in.

I always hated Milton, especially his stupid name (sorry other Miltons).  He would always walk with with an intentional slow step as if it was to show off that he was in control.  He always sported a red fishing hat, I don’t remember what it said but it had a marlin harpooned flopping into a boat.  He smelled of cigarettes,  I told my mom it was good that he smoked that way when he died he would be used to the burning feeling.  But all of these things were forgivable.

I can’t blame my mom for being lonely, I just felt like I was not enough for her.  But whatever my faults were I don’t understand why she like him.  At first he put on a show and always tried to be nice to me.  He took me out fishing once.  But something switched in his head like he was the king of this castle.  Instead of mom being happy to see him, it was more like she was trying to make happy.  Always washing his car, always making sure his food was ready at 6 o’clock and definitely not talking during the football games.  Our little house turned into a jail.

I started to understand my mom’s fear.  One day I came back from volleyball practice.  I had made the playoffs.  I never thought I would be that great, but that game I was on fire.  I had several spikes and felt like I was unstoppable.  The coach took us out to eat and had the whole team cheer me on.   I rode my bike from the pizza joint from our teams celebration just to let her know how well I did.  I walked into the house feeling like a champ, I had all the respect of my teammates.  I opened up the door and started to let my mom know.

“We’re going to the playoffs Mom.  You should have seen it!”, It came out with all my enthusiasm.

My mom popped her head out of the kitchen with her smile, but it wasn’t for long.  Milton got out of the easy chair. Stood up and let us know how he felt.

“All I ask is to sit down and watch some football.  And then this kid is screaming his head odd about his stupid team.  So what kid, what did you do that’s better than the NFL game on the TV?  I can’t watch the game tell me boy what’s so important about you?”

In my whole life, it was unheard of for a grown man to bully a kid.  The air was sucked out of my lungs and I must have had a stupid look on my face of confusion rather than anger because his actions just didn’t register.  Mom knew emotionally Milton’s behavior somehow and tried to protect me.  Tried to.  I went to my room.  How could Milton mess up my day?

I could hear parts of that conversation:

“he’s just a kid, what’s wrong with you…”

“You baby him he’ll never be man…”

I remember it clearly. The yelling had gotten bad that night, and I was doing my best to drown it out. Whatever I did, I could stop my eyes from getting hot and tears fell out against my will.  I put a pillow over my ears and just stared and stared into that popcorn ceiling.  If I could only focus over there maybe this would pass.  I stared until my eyes blurred.  That’s when I heard it—a soft, gentle voice, barely audible over the noise downstairs. I thought I was imagining it at first, but then it spoke again, clearer this time.

“Check under the couch cushion,” it said.

Then I saw it.  I looked again at the ceiling I saw an old man kind of like Merlin.  I could see his beard and hat from the popcorn ceiling.  When I tried to call back to him, he faded back into the ceiling.  I don’t remember much more I was emotionally worn out and went to sleep.

That morning the apartment was quiet, I didn’t know if Milton was there but his influence certainly wasn't there anymore.    I got ready for school, made a quick breakfast and got ready to ride to school.  But I remembered what Merlin told me about the couch cushion.  I pulled out a video game I wanted.  I held it in my hands and just looked at it.  I never got anything new like this, maybe my mom saved it for volleyball.

Riding my bike to school, I thought about it more.  Mom would not have guessed that I would have made the playoffs.  Maybe, it was an apology gift from Milton.  It was more likely than a supernatural creature.  I shook my head and let the air resistance from traveling flush over my face.  Maybe things would be alright, maybe Milton realized he needs us more than we need him and he is trying to make up for the bad behavior.  Right?

That day after school, my mom sat me down and said that Milton would never yell at me like that again.  She even said he was very sorry.  I thought that was it maybe he learned his lesson.  I hugged my mom, I know she stood up to him and paid a price.  I went upstairs to play my new game.  It was so nice to have something new and that wasn’t handed down or broken.  Mom went up to room and and smiled that I was enjoying myself playing video games.

“Come on down we’re waiting for you for dinner.”, My mom said here happy tone.

I wasn’t ready to eat with Milton, but as long as it was an apology dinner, I couldn’t mind too much.  I went down and he had sat at the head of the table; we never did that it was always me and mom sitting opposite of each other.  He sat there with his stupid hat on his head and drank a beer before we ate.  I dismissed this as Milton being Milton.  Mom placed a meatloaf that looked like it took a long time to make.  Milton even tried to make small talk and asked about volleyball.  I answered back politely and thought to myself this must be how politicians talk to each other to avoid war.  Mom passed me some vegetables and I filled up my plate.  Mom suggested that’s a lot of veggies.  Milton then raised his voice.

“Son, you need to eat some meat, especially after your mother slaved over the stove to make this nice dinner for us.”

“I don’t want meatloaf and..”,I trailed off.

“I didn’t asked if you if you wanted the meatloaf I told you to put it on your plate and eat it.”, his voice raised with his temper.

“And I am not your son.”, I ran up to my room at full speed.

That fat pig better not think about marrying my mom.  He thought he good buy me that stupid game to buy me off.  I pulled the game out of the console and smashed it.  I jumped on it. Scratched it.  I made sure I did not leave anything recognizable about the game left.  I opened up more door threw down the game and yelled back

“I don’t want your stupid game either!”, The feeling of yelling that out let that old man know that this kid need anything from him.

“I didn’t buy you a f’ing game.  I’m not going to waste money your stupid ass”.

I sat on the floor as if the wind was knocked out of me.  What is going on?  Well, there is definitely another fight going on downstairs.  I thought Mom talked to him and straightened him out.  I thought the game was a bribe from Milton.  He is just being the same old prick as he ever was.  I lay flat on the floor and stared back at the ceiling.  And then there he was again.  Merlin's face appeared again this time without as much effort.

“I know you can use some help.  Look under the garden gnome with the green hat.”

Merlin’s voice comforted me and let me know that somehow I would make it through.  And after I heard his words his face disappeared into the ceiling again.  I felt my eyes close and sleep came to me.  I looked out the window and Milton was gone, his truck wasn;t there.  AS I walked down the stairs I saw Mom sitting on the coach sipping cold coffee,  She hadn’t slept.  S

“I would never let you down, but honey I can make the rent.  Id on;t know what I’ll do.  Milton said he’d give it to me and he walked out last night.”  The uncertainty filled her words.

I knew that she couldn’t hide this from me.  She did everything to make sure my life was normal; It must have killed her that she let me down by not being able to pay the rent.  I let her know everything would be ok, we’ll find a way through it.  As I was about to bike to school, I remembered merlin’s words.  I looked under the gnome with the green hat and there it was.  I perfectly wadded up roll of hundreds.  When you see your first hundred-dollar bill, it amazes you.  It is the same material as a single but it is always treated better.  Whatever the buyer bought they treated better than the singles that are torn and the ink faded.  Each one of those had its own potential of purchasing power.  I held it my hand but I did the right thing; I went back inside.

“Mom, Mom look, Loooook”, I said with a wild expression on my face.

She picked me up and wiped away her tears.  She beamed with happiness and I knew that meant we both really didn’t need Milton.  I rode off more proud than when I won the playoffs in volleyball,  I went to school with my chest puffed out and realized we only needed Merlin.

Milton whether we needed him or not made his return.  I found out coming back from school with his truck parked in front.  He had the gall to park it diagonally to make sure he took up the place,  I went in take a deep breath and did not what to expect on the other side of the door.  He was there standing up, waiting for me.  Mother greeted me and let me know that Milton had something to say to me.  He made a quick apology.  I thought maybe the concession of an apology was worth the brevity of it.  To get a jerk like that to admit he was wrong was something I never thought was possible. I went in and did my homework upstairs.  I was stuck on a hard math problem something wasn’t clicking and it would come up.  I stared up and Merlin was there as if he watched everything.

“You know why he was good this time?”  Merlin said with his deep baritone voice.

“Did you do something?”, I asked

“Grapefruit juice keeps him calm.  Put some grapefruit juice in his coffee and he will never cause your mom or you any problems again.”, with those words Merlin disappeared.

I woke up early and experienced the same peace I felt the last two times.  He was still here but he wasn't causing any problems.  But if he could behave I could even tolerate him.  I went to the kitchen and got some grapefruit juice.  I hate this stuff.  Mom loved to eat it for breakfast.  To me I could never tolerate those things, it felt as though a skunk sprayed an orange.  Anyways I poured the grapefruit juice in the coffee and went off to school like before.  When I returned, Milton’s truck was there but so were a fire truck and ambulance.

My mom answered the questions posed by the medics.  She must have been there for hours.  She came and hugged me explaining that she didn’t understand.  One minute he was walking and talking and the next he fell over holding his heart.  She broke out into a cry right after saying this.  I held her trying to comfort her but I knew I was involved.  The EMT explained that he had not taken his heart medications and that his blood pressure must have spiked too high.  She explained that he did take his medicine with his coffee this morning.   

That was years ago.  I know now that the grapefruit juice counteracted Milton’s medicine.  The face in the ceiling never appeared again in the house.  Things got back to normal and life moved on.  I never even thought about it, as life progressed and got more complicated.  The other day I went up to my college dorm and slammed the door.  My girlfriend was mad at me for forgetting her dinner reservations.  We had a big fight about it.  As I lay on my bunk I saw it.  That old popcorn ceiling I had in my childhood home.



“Go buy her some blue roses at the market on campus.”

Merlin’s face emerged from the ceiling effortlessly.  His demeanor remained as neutral but I would never trust him again.  And that is why I hide my face in the pillow at night.
