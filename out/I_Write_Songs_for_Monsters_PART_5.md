Something was fishy. For starters, the monsters applauded the moment I passed through the doors. That was weird. And secondly, the Redhead greeted me with a black rose.   
 
“Hank!” She handed me the rose; it wilted the moment it touched my hands.  “The man of the hour.”  


Ivan looked up and sneered. He made a pretend gun with his hands and shot me. Already, I was sweating. The monster bar was hazy and hot, and smelled like fried human brains. The lizards at the bar were chatting amiably, and licking each other’s faces.  
 
Tony rushed over; he seemed hellbent on getting me to the stage. “The songs aren’t gonna sing themselves,” he said, while puffing on a penis-shaped cigar.   
 
I coughed and fanned the smoke. He handed me yet another list of songs and shooed me towards the stage. I did a quick soundcheck; as usual, the sound was perfect. The stage lights came on, nearly blinding me. The monsters hushed. I played the entire list of songs, making them up as I went along. To my surprise, the monsters dug it. The headless zombies jumped for joy and did silly dances; the trolls shouted and emptied keg after keg. No fights. No mayhem.  
 
I knew something was up. 
 
The gig was eventless. For that, I counted my blessings. Still, I didn’t trust them. They were setting me up. For what, I wasn’t sure. Lester phoned me the following morning; he seemed pleased. Somehow, this made matters worse: even when monsters are pleased, they sound evil.  
 
“We got everything we need,” Lester said in a slippery voice. “We recorded the entire set. Soon, your songs will be hits,” he promised. “Big money.”

When I asked about payment, he chuckled.  
 
“Talk to Tony,” he said, and quickly changed the subject. 
 
He had no intention of paying me. This seemed obvious. I was worried, and for good reason. There's a wall of severed heads with a vacant spot. I had to do something. It was do or die.  
 
Time for Plan A. 
 
I ran some errands before the gig. 


The stairs descending to the basement of the ramshackle building seemed to go on forever. I was exhausted by the time I reached Inferno. But I was determined to get this over with. My stomach was in knots. I was nervous. My plan was risky, and I had many doubts.
 
I arrived early.   
 
Ivan fixed me one of his infamous drinks; he called it Vodka Surprise. It tasted like roadkill. I choked it down in one good gulp, then plopped myself down at the bar. The lizards were gathered in their usual seats, watching me keenly; seated to my right, the pixie was quarrelling with Bronzie. He looked over at me, clenching his football-sized fists.  
 
I was sweating. More than usual. And that’s saying a lot. I asked for a jug of water and instantly regretted it. The water was as clean as a public toilet. It smelled like sulfur. I took a small sip and gagged. Next time, I’m bringing my own water. (If, of course, there was a next time, which was doubtful). 
 
When I jumped to the stage, everyone sprang to their feet. The roar was deafening. My ego inflated like a helium balloon. The monsters started chanting: DEATHSVILLE... DEATHSVILLE... DEATHSVILLE...   
 
I scratched my head. I knew they liked the song, but why the adulation?   
 
Then I noticed.   
 
Above the pee trough was a large poster with my face on it. Except that’s not quite right. It wasn’t exactly my face. Yes, my eyes were hazel, and my hair was shaggy, but my lips were rouge and I had fangs. I was gaunt; my face was scabby and sinister. The person staring back at me was hideous. One of them. Was that what Lester meant by prettying me up? Yikes. 
 
The keyboard was replaced with a rickety, ragtime piano. I hoped it was in tune. Due to popular demand, I opened with Slow Train to Deathsville. The place went bonkers. The fairies spun and danced, the ogres moaned and stomped their feet, the zombies raised their flabby arms in praise. Even Bronzie couldn’t contain his excitement; he knew all the words, and sang along (off key, of course). By the final chorus, he grabbed a two-headed troll and ripped one of its heads clean off. Blood and bits of brains exploded.  
 
Despite the chaos, I played all the monster songs I knew. By the end of the first set, I was covered in beer and blood, chicken wings and hot sauce. My clothes were ruined; I was a gooey mess. I cleaned myself off as best I could, then meandered towards the bar and ordered a beer.   
 
Maybe the monsters weren’t so bad, I told myself, while sipping a watery ale. Maybe I could get used to this gig. Perhaps, but not likely. First things first, I needed to get paid. Ivan made a sour face when I asked him.   
 
“Gotta talk to the boss,” he said, in his low-octave voice. His drooping eyes were downcast; he was visibly upset. He leaned over close enough to smell his corpse-like breath. “You’re famous,” he said, barely above a whisper. “They love you.” 
 
The words hit me like a sucker punch; I didn’t know how to respond, so I shrugged.   
 
“Deathsville” he added, “is a huge hit.”  
 
“Really?” My shock was genuine. Even though I despise most pop music of the past twenty-five years, I stay up to date with what’s current.    
 
Ivan noticed my confusion. “See for yourself.”  
 
He reached into his cloak and produced a peculiar cellphone wrapped in human skin. On the screen, bright-eyed and alert, was my face – or that monster’s version of me. The song was playing, and I was parading around like an idiot, singing and dancing. It was me, but it wasn’t me at the same time.   
 
“Who? What? Where?” I couldn’t make sense of this.  
 
“Stupid human,” Ivan snapped. “You think everything revolves around you.”  
 
He was so tall, I had to crane my neck just to speak to him.  
 
“There are worlds beyond this one,” he said in a treacherous voice, soaking me with spittle. “Demicon is our home. Not his awful place.”   
 
Of course! I’d heard of such things in the past. My ex was fascinated with ghouls and ghosts and everything strange. As I regarded the music video, a mixture of fear and pride developed within me. At least the video seemed professional. Just then, a lizard person slithered over and asked for an autograph; he handed me a small poster with my face on it. My first autograph, and it’s to a lizard-faced monster wearing a fedora. I signed it. As he turned away, he slid me a note: UR LIFE IS DANGER!!!  
 
I gulped. Was this a warning? If so, he could've used proper grammar. Then again, monsters aren’t too bright.  
 
Tony and the Redhead appeared out of thin air; they looked displeased. 
 
“Hank!” the Redhead said, loud enough for all to hear, “how the heck are ya?”   
 
She wore a skin-tight, see-through dress, black eyeliner, and high-heeled boots. Her lips were painted like cherries, as were her fingernails. I couldn’t keep my eyes off her, and hated myself for it. 
 
Tony rushed over; he tapped his gold watch. “Shouldn’t ya be up there.” He pointed to the stage.  
 
“You gotta pay me first,” I said, surprising both of us.  
 
“Hank!” the Redhead roared. “What’s come over you? Are you sick?” She touched my forehead; her hands were icebergs.  
 
“I don’t even know your name!” I shoved her hand aside. Suddenly, I was burning with rage.   
 
“Oh Hank,” she swatted my arm, “you’re such a darling!”  
 
Tony grabbed me by the throat. “Listen here, you little twerp!” His leathery face turned tomato-red. “Get your scrawny ass on stage and start playing. That’s an order!”  
 
He let go, and I started wheezing. I wasn’t getting paid, that much was clear. I moped towards the stage and plopped onto the bench. I looked up and gasped. 
 
The barroom had transformed. The dining area was decorated with fancy tablecloths and expensive cutlery. The monsters, seated at their respective tables, regarded me as food. Their tummies rumbling like Harleys. A pair of squid-like cooks poked out from the kitchen; they were sharpening their knives and licking their greasy faces.    

I noticed the vacant spot on the wall of severed heads, and frowned. They’re planning on beheading me, I realized, unhappily. Then offering me up as the main course. The monsters continued staring at me and licking their filthy faces. Do they always eat musicians, I wondered? According to the wall of severed heads, yes.   
 
My fingers fidgeted with the zippo lighter in my pants pocket; hidden inside my vest was a can of lighter fluid. There’s zero chance my head will find that vacant spot on the wall.  
 
Time for Plan A.  
 
The stage lights found me. I was trembling. I wasn’t sure if I could go through with this. What if something went wrong? Something always goes wrong. 
 
Pain, sharp as a tack, surprised me. My finger was bitten. Snakes! The piano keys were squiggling and squirming; their tiny voices were mocking me: “off with his head... off with his head...”  
 
This can’t be happening. I closed my eyes. Despite the slithering serpents, I launched into Ring of Fire, playing it in a minor key, which sounded dreadful. The monsters went berserk, slam dancing and brawling. Pure pandemonium. I followed it up with Great Balls of Fire, playing it as fast as humanly possible. Halfway through the song, the multi-armed cooks came at me, waving butcher knives. Their murderous eyes aimed at mine.  
 
The pandemonium persisted. The pixie was spinning brightly. Bronzie growled. He squashed the pixie – SPLAT – and shoved her inside his mouth and swallowed her whole. He belched. Then he started pounding his fists against the piano, threatening to destroy it. 
 
Plan A to the rescue. 
 
While my right hand tinkered the keys, I reached into my vest pocket and grabbed the lighter fluid. I doused the piano, emptying the entire can. Then I kicked the bench aside and jumped on top of the piano, kicking the snaky keys in a steady rock and roll rhythm. Bronzie was unimpressed. He roared loud enough to pop my eardrums. I grabbed the zippo and smiled with bad intentions. By now, the entire barroom had me surrounded. They were chanting: OFF WITH HIS HEAD... OFF WITH HIS HEAD...  
 
With a flick of the wrist, the lighter flamed; I dropped it inside the piano. WOOSH. The piano burst into a brilliant blue blaze. The heat was ferocious. I leapt off the piano and dashed for the exit. Bronzie tried grabbing me but missed; instead, he caught fire and was engulfed in flames.    
 
“STOP HIM!” Tony ordered.   
 
An alarm sounded. It was louder than a jumbo jet. My spine nearly snapped in two. My teeth hurt. So did my brain. It was so friggin’ loud.   
 
I ran.  
 
A lounge of lizards tackled me. Their skin felt like sandpaper, only colder. How could they be so cold in this fiery hellhole?   
 
“Got him!” a grim-faced reptilian shouted. He started coughing. The raging fire was spreading. Monsters were moaning and turning tables over. The fairies were weeping. The smell of burnt flesh and singed hair was repugnant. Somewhere, a monster was calling for Endora. The Redhead roared in response. So that’s her name! 
 
“You little turd,” the lizard said, holding me hostage. He poked me in the eyes, and I went blind.   
 
“Bring him to me,” Tony ordered.  “Time to serve up the main course!”  
 
“Save me the blood!” Ivan shouted over the racket. 
 
Another monster exploded. Someone screamed in agony. I kept blinking in hopes my sight would return. One thing was certain: the monsters hated fire. The place was burning up. You'd think with a name like Inferno, the place would be more resilient to fire. 
 
I was dragged to my feet. The lizard holding me prisoner suddenly detonated, and I was caked in green goop. I made a mad dash to the door, tripped, and fell head-first onto the side of the bar. The pain was egregious. I wiped a mound of blood from my face. This wasn’t how I envisioned Plan A.  
 
“Oh Hank,” the Redhead cackled.  
 
At that point, my eyesight returned. I watched in horror as she transformed into her true form: an olive-skinned witch, clad in tattered rags and a pointed black hat. She was holding a broomstick. A boil on her treacherous face burst. Her hair turned to charcoal; her fingernails were rotting, as were her crooked teeth.  
 
She flew above me on her broomstick, “You’re one of us now. Don’t be afraid.” 
  
As I lay beside the bar in a pool of blood, a shadowy figure approached: the lizard who asked for the autograph. He helped me to my feet. “Go now!” he said in a croaky voice. “Hurry!”  
 
Behind him, the bar was ablaze. Bottles of booze were bursting like fireworks, scorching the liquor-soaked walls. One by one the severed head imploded. Tony, busy ordering everyone around, saw me and snarled. Then his pants caught fire. The fire quickly spread. He started shrieking and demanding help. Then he melted.  
 
“Nooooo!” Endora flew to the spot where he was standing. Her broomstick caught fire, as did her pointed black hat. In an instant, she, too, was gone.  
 
The smell of death was deplorable. I looked away and sprinted to the exit. The door handle was burning hot, and scolded me. Wincing in pain, I flung the door open and raced upstairs, but not before sticking a barstool against the door, trapping them inside.     
 
The stairs were endless. When I finally reached the door, I was greeted by a severed head. “Ooh, you’re in hot water now,” it said. 

The head exploded.    
 
I took the long way home, reveling in the sound of firetrucks and first responders. I wondered what they would think when they arrived on the scene. Then again, I’m sure they were used to demonic activity. This town was known for it, after all. Just another day in Deathsville, USA.   
 
The following morning, I rushed to the hospital. I suffered second-degree burns on my hand, which sucked. And I had a nasty gouge below my eye. But that wasn’t what concerned me. I needed to leave town. Pronto. I sold most of my stuff (which wasn’t much), paid my last month’s rent, and migrated north. Moose and Molsons, hockey and poutine, here I come.  
 
The remainder of summer was spent trying to find a job in North Ontario. I lived in constant fear. Monsters may be stupid, but they have special powers. It was only a matter of time before they found me. Then what? They’d chop me up and serve my head on a platter. That’s what. 
 
But nothing happened.   
 
Eventually, I landed a steady gig at a dive bar. I worked as a dishwasher during the day and an entertainer at night. A good gig. The people were nice, and nobody suspected a thing.   
 
... 
 
So, that’s how I ended up writing songs for monsters. It sounds unbelievable, even to me. But it’s true. All of it. Halloween is fast approaching, and the weather has turned ice cold. How these people live like this is beyond me. Plenty of warm clothing, I suppose.  
 
Earlier this morning, an email arrived. 
 
My heart plummeted. My mouth went dry. 
 
They’ve found me.  
 
 I read Lester’s email, and nearly died:  
 
Hank, you dimwit, the people of Demicon adore you. Down here, you’re a superstar! You’re expected to perform at an awards show tomorrow night. Much planning is needed. Monsters don’t take kindly to disobedience. I’ve arranged everything. Be ready by noon. Do NOT be late.   
 
Lester __ 
  
... 
 
I’m panicking. 
 
It’s nearly noon.  
 
Not much time!   
 
I’ve been typing furiously, trying to get this story out before my descent to the Underworld. Demicon sounds nice, right? I mean, how bad can it be? I envisioned my head on a platter, and groaned. 
 
My advice to you is simple. If you ever stumble upon a monster bar, do NOT enter. Turn away and never look back. Monsters are real. They exist. And they’re not to be trusted. Ever.  
 
My phone beeped. A chill dripped down my spine. The text is from an unknown sender.
