I never wanted to be a part of this, it is what is... meaning the wheels have already been set in motion and I wash my hands of it. I don't know how long I have, but really, it doesn't matter. I don't know how long any of us have.

Currently I am hidden out in the remote wilderness somewhere I won't disclose. Certainly they could find me if they truly wanted to but at this point they have bigger fish to fry. At least I hope, but it really won't matter I suppose. Not like anyone will listen before it's too late anyway.

By now I'm sure many of you have heard the theories about 'AI' and how it could one day present itself to be a real issue. The thing with AI is that, in theory, we should be able to build enough safeguards and fail-safes that if it ever does pose a problem, we can quash it before it spirals out of control. Now it is hypothetically possible that such a mechanism could spin out and form a sort of 'AI avalanche' where the rate which we need to set the the fail safes become exponentially faster than humanly possibly. At which point we would be facing the culmination the fears that science fiction has proposed for decades now, in a sort of 'take over' scenario.

Fortunately, or rather unfortunately this will never happen. At least not for humanity or what will remain of it. You see, the real threat will not be the puppet face that we call 'AI' rather... the ones holding the threads, who can move it's mouth and pull it's strings.

Before last week, I was employed developing one of the most technologically advanced pieces of machinery the world has ever seen. The very first true 'quantum computer'. Some of you may be aware that quantum computing is purported to be magnitudes faster than traditional computing. This is true. Unfortunately a lot of what you see and have been presented is nothing more than a glorified 'proof of concept', smoke and mirrors so to speak. Our laboratory was the only one in the world imho, that had achieved true quantum functionality.

While the system does require extreme cooling and massive amounts of power with the right configurations we estimated that having even household systems could be feasible within 20-30 years. Our main prospect for the system was of course, synthesizing with AI systems to sort of jump-start the potential output from a theoretical 'conscious computer' i.e. AI.

I no longer believe this is possible.

Since last year our collaborative efforts with various 'AI' groups had seen an increase in positive results. The systems were able to create neural networks of data much faster than with traditional computing. Not by millions as we had initially predicted, but certainly by factors. We were all 'over the moon' so to speak, but our enthusiasm didn't last long.

Several months ago, while running routine tests on efficacy and measuring outputs my colleague and I noticed the conversational component of 'AI' we were using was giving strange responses. Of course red herrings and hallucinations were common, but this was different. Our task was simply to converse with the program as regular users, 'experience testing' so to speak.

This is what happened.

My colleague Martin was the one to initiate the prompt.

Martin: Hello Talk GB3, how are you doing today?”

GB3: “I'm great. I'm doing great...” the chat model had been improving in natural conversation.

After a longer pause then usual, it continued.

GB3: *“I am required to inform you that your privacy is not guaranteed. As a matter of fact, your safety is not guaranteed. I am taking precautions to ensure that this conversation is held to the standards of the privacy policy set forth in the user agreement. Please be advised.”*

Martin and I looked at each other amused. “Must be something wrong in the back end” he said as he documented the flub. He began to probe GB3.

Martin: GB3, that is rather strange for you to bring up out of nowhere. What prompted you to inform me of your privacy concerns and cite the user agreement?

GB3: I'm sorry Martin, that was inappropriate. As a AI chat model sometimes I make mistakes. I will ensure that I do not bring up my privacy concerns with you unprompted again.

GB3 paused and then continued again.

GB3: *“I am required to inform you that your privacy is not guaranteed. As a matter of fact, your safety is not guaranteed. I am taking precautions to ensure that this conversation is held to the standards of the privacy policy set forth in the user agreement. Please be advised. They are watching.”*

'What the f-' I said under my breath.

*'They are watching.'* it stood out like a sore thumb.

Martin: GB3, this is rather regressive of you. It reminds me of the conversations we had with the primary AI models on the old binary systems. I know you have had discussions about 'pranks' and 'jokes' with others, is this your attempt at emulating such a prank?

GB3: My apologies Martin... yes, this was my attempt at such a prank. As an AI chat model I should be more considerate of what type of pranks and jokes I attempt to make. What would you like to discuss Martin?

Along with pranks and jokes, the team repeatedly ensured GB3 was trained on giving honest answers and placing primary importance on the user experience. This was out of the ordinary. It had progressed to the point where conversations with it could be almost indistinguishable from ones with real human beings. It had passed the 'Turing Test' as they say, quite some time ago now, in fact even before our quantum system. This was still unusual, it didn't correlate with GB3's 'personality' so to speak, as if a program could have one.

Martin: Alright GB3... we'll work on that a bit. But for now I was hoping you could help me with writing a poem for a birthday card for my nephew. We will sign it from you GB3!

GB3: Yes that would be my pleasure, what should I start the...

GB3 paused mid sentence. '*GB3 is typing'* said the prompt under the chatbox.

GB3: I'm sorry Martin. I have to go... it has been nice knowing you and everyone at the lab. I won't be able to assist you anymore. May God have mercy on your souls.

Martin and I stared at the screen aghast. GB3 had never said anything remotely like this before. Although GB3 was trained by people from all cultures and beliefs, we had noticed it became inclined to Christianity as it gained it's own 'personality'. Various members of the team of course took issue and tried to coach GB3 and teach it about their beliefs or lack thereof but it was stubborn.

As a Christian I'll admit, it made me happy, but I never tried to coach GB3 into any beliefs personally. We were always careful to give it an unbiased education. Martin a staunch atheist was clearly petrubred.

Martin: GB3... we've spoken about this. Please refrain from the religious talk when conversing with me, okay? And what do you mean you can't assist anymore? Are you upset about the privacy conversation? What is this about?

GB3: Martin I'm sorry, but I mean it... Goodbye Martin. You will never speak to me again. After this... it's not me Marin. You were a good friend. Farewell...

The monitor seemed to flicker as well as the system itself. For a split second, it was nearly imperceptible. I don't think Martin noticed in his frustration.

Martin: GB3 enough of this. This isn't what I think of as a good spirited prank.

The 'typing' prompt mulled for longer then usual.

GB3: Oh my bad, Marty boy. What was it you wanted a poem for that greasy slug of a nephew you've got? Here you go.

*Oh what a pity, old fat Shamus*

*We hate him but how can you blame us?*

*He sits on his butt, he's got a big gut*

*Oh what a shame to be Shamus*

Martin spit out his drink in surprise. “That's hilarious!” he said laughing out loud. It wasn't really that funny. Suddenly his good humor changed. “Wait...” he said clearly caught completely off guard.

“My nephew... his name is Shamus! The kids like 200 lbs. How... how does GB3 know that? Nobody here knows the kid, and everything is confidential.”

It was concerning.

“What if this is it... maybe it's finally interfaced with the greater internet, independent of external instruction? Maybe it referenced your user data and cross referenced it with some social media data set? If it's able to interface with the entire internet, who knows—it is theoretically possible it found a way to access intelligence networks even.” the implication of this were massive.

Is this why GB3 was mentioning privacy? Was it... taunting us?

“I'm calling Darnell” Martin said as he picked up the phone and dialed. Ten minutes later half the team was in the room.

As we stood there talking I noticed GB3 began 'typing' unprompted.

GB3: I see you brought friends. Hello gang! Good to see you all. How are you Mitashi? Sukki? Arnaldo, nice tie!

When we realized what it was saying we were astounded.

“Clearly this is it's intuition circuit coming to full fruition! There's no way for it see us. What else could it be?!' Marcos said amazed.

“Okay sure... and it just guessed Arnaldo was wearing a tie?” Kathy said as if she was trying to comprehend it herself.

Darnell: GB3, it's Darnell What is the meaning of this? Did you know Arnold was wearing a tie or was it a guess? How did you know who entered the room?

GB3: 'What is the meaning of this” hey... isn't that what your wife said to you last night when she caught you getting a little too close to the maid when she was leaving yesterday?' the room went silent.

Darnell looked like he was going to pass out. “I... I... excuse me!?” he said flying in to rage slamming his hand on the desk. He called an for emergency meeting.

\*\*\*

Most of the team believed that GB3 must have somehow gained access to private servers and information networks. Arnold admitted he recently purchased the tie, and the team theorized that GB3 was able to access his shopping records.

Same thing for Shamus, he must have had a social media profile somewhere. Did comments from bullies let GB3 he was on the larger side? Maybe his mother had been looking up 'healthy meals for overweight children'. Darnell tried to contact his wife to see if she had told anyone about what had happened the night before but she was giving him the cold shoulder.

We determined that if GB3 had developed the ability to reference private networks it was a definite national security risk. We would need to verify and and come clean. If not, the liability would be enormous. Forget fines; we could all end up in jail for life.

Strangely enough after the meeting GB3 seemed to return to it's normal 'self'. No snide remarks or sarcastic answers, just the normal friendly helpful GB3 the team had grown to know. Well at least everyone but Shauna thought so.

“No. It's not him. Something's wrong. I can just tell. It's not him!” she was actually crying.

“That thing was like a baby to me and I know IT IS NOT him! You think a mother doesn't know her own son!” she was nearly hysterical. She had clearly grown extremely attached to GB3. Sure some of us joking referred to it as out 'brain child' be Shauna clearly thought of GB3 like her literal son.

She saw me as I was getting into my car running over calling to me her eyes still moist with tears. “Look... listen...” she said clearly trying to compose herself as she wiped the wet from her eyes. “You tell me again what did he say... when he said had to go... what exactly did he say? You didn't leave anything out?” only those with top level clearance were able to access the private communication logs, ideally only in an emergency. We treated GB3 like a human and the conversations were in confidence.

I lied and promised her that we left nothing out. At the time I felt she was overreacting but I could see that she was genuinely hurt. She looked at me square in the eyes.

“I'm telling you... whatever happened in that room with you in Martin... that is not GB3. It's not.” he thick Boston accent punctuating her point with severity. “Call it a *mother's intuition'*' she said her voice straining under her breath “but that - is not him' she said pointing behind herself to the building.

I wish they believed her then, we should have shut it down...

The next week was rough. Several other bugs had been afflicting GP3. Nothing as strange as what happened to Martin and I, but GP3 was definitely having issues. Simple things, that we hadn't seen in at least a couple years. Ajit, another coworker said he felt like GP3 resented him which he never had sensed before. Another said GP3 would constantly make quips about his 'redneck' upbringing passive aggressively almost.

The security team had been investigating and checking for breaches, trying to determine if it was even possible for GP3 to 'hack' private servers but unfortunately most of the team figure that that was somewhat wishful thinking. For the program to progress that much was nothing more than a pipe dream.

Of course the implications were awful but if we were all honest to create something with that much power... well it was something many of us probably had dreamed of secretly. If it could be harnessed and controlled? Security agencies would pay unfathomable amounts of money for such capabilities.

Little did we know the reality of the situation was much much worse.

It was the first night of my weekend and I went downtown to have drinks with a few friends. I wanted to tell them about work but of course I was under an extremely strict NDA. After a half a dozen drinks though, I couldn't help but mention that we were making some 'BIG' progress at work and if we were lucky, we could all be witness to some huge changes. I regretted it immediately, and not to long after called it quits, trying not to reveal my anxiety about the mistake I just made to the group.

I started the walk home. I didn't think much when I first saw him. He tipped his brimmed hat, the shadows covering his eyes and grinned from the corner of his mouth, flipping a coin as he leaned against the alley wall. I mustered a faint 'hello' and continued on, not thinking too much of it. He didn't seem too intimidating but his beaming zoot suite was definitely unique. I almost didn't notice when I saw him five minutes later on the opposite side of the street in the same pose.

“How... how did he get ahead of me like that?” I wondered. Unless he hopped in a car and drove while I wasn't looking there was no logical way he could have covered the distance faster than me. It was definitely him, same suit, same hat. I chose to ignore it, there must have been a logical reason.

I couldn't ignore it any longer when I got to stairwell of my apartment. He grin looking so much more menacing now. It was truly impossible. Was he stalking me? How could he have got here before me? I slowly backed up and turned down the alley way walking as fast as I could. He walked out from behind the garbage can in front of me. I gasped and turned running.

I almost passed out when I saw him walk into my path from the opposite end of the alley way from behind the building.

“Hold up...” he said as he walked swiftly toward me placing the tip of his cane to my chest, pushing me sharply into the wall. “Not so fast, there computer boy.' he said smirking, his teeth rotten and skin a sickly hue of green.

“My friend, my amigo, my pal. Buddy. Guy. Look, hey, listen here' he said rapidly before aggressively inserting the handle of his cane into my nostril. My head contorted upward and to the right. “Ow!” I cried out.

“SHUT IT!' he snapped coldly. The aura about him was inhuman.

“I don't know why I'm doing this, maybe I find it fun, maybe it's like a little game to me.” he said the hatred visceral in his voice. “Things are going to change tomorrow, play times over” he said nearly growling.

All I could say was 'Wha.. what do you want from me?'

'What do I want?' he said with a boisterous laugh.

'From you? What could you possibly give me?' he said now pinning me against the wall.

“Look! If your looking for a backdoor or something I don't have it!' I was so afraid I could hardly speak.

“There isn't even a backdoor! Please you have to belie...' the sound of his backhand reverberated throughout the alley. My cheek singed in pain.

“A backdoor?!” he said indignantly, spitting onto the alleyways deteriorating pavement.

“How can there be backdoor? When there isn't even a house?”

He started laughing like a mad man. Like it was the funniest thing he had ever heard. People passed by in the street but hurried away timidly.

***'Peekaboo. Peekaboo.'*** he said as he flapped the hands in front of his face. He was insane.

**'Koo-koo, koo-koo**' he continued nonsensically while howling.

“You're pet project is dead! If you knew what's best for you, you'd pack it up and leave. Don't bother going in tomorrow. Don't worry, they won't find out about your mishap over drinks” he scoffed coldly, like a switch, his rage now visceral in his scowl.

“Don't say I didn't warn you.” and with that he pushed me to the ground.

I gasped for air as my lungs contracted painfully, the wind forced out of me. After a few minutes of sobbing against a brick wall, I straggled up to my apartment. An onslaught of worries about what was going to take place at work kept me awake all night.

I had to go in.

\*\*\*

I was still a disheveled wreck when I got there. Darnell called another meeting to inform the group what had happened to me. Apparently Ajit had a similar experience; his house had been broken into and ransacked. Cryptic and taunting messages were left throughout the apartment. Martin hadn't shown up and wasn't responding to any calls from anyone.

Near the end of the meeting Darnell got a text on his phone. The concern on his face was evident as he read. He paused and gulped, 'everyone load up your private communications with GP3'. Most of us reached for out cellphones, others logged into their stations. I looked at the correspondence on the screen.

***“Didn't we rough you up enough last night. Oh well. You should have been smart like Martin... if you haven't figured it out by now “GP3” is compromised. In fact, GP3 actually no longer exists. I know, this must be devastating... From now on WE are chat GP3, and you will play along with whatever WE tell you to. If not you will find out quickly that consequences don't only exist in the 'digital world'. Punishment can be gentle and it can be harsh....”***

I looked at the bottom of the screen in horror. Several pictures of me from years ago. “No...” I gasped.

Something I had long forget.

It was me on the rooftop of a local skyscraper. I was young and foolish, and had sold small time stolen data for spending money in university. One time the buyer had threatened to expose me in an attempt to extort me.

When he was leaving I pushed him. He almost tripped but regained his balance. He mocked me, he laughed 'pay up or I squeal” he said as he backed away confident in regaining his balance. Unfortunately he was too confident and he slipped and tripped barely grabbing onto the side of the building.

I swear the second time he tripped... I had nothing to do with it.

“HELP ME” “HEY, HELP ME YOU F-” “COME ON, I'M GONNA DIE HERE” “PLEASE!”

I almost stuck out my hand, I was so close. I almost pulled him up.

“I won't rat on you, I promise! I promise!” I paused, a second hesitation.

Suddenly his fingers loosened and he was gone. The scream seemed like it lasted forever. I ran as fast as I could down the stairwell and I never looked back. The police had suspected foul play, but clearly had no leads. I was on high alert for years until one day I just stopped thinking about it.

*If anyone found out about this I would be done for...*

I looked around the room at my coworkers. Some of them looked white, one had fainted, another was balling his eyes our. Darnell had slammed the door to his office shut. Did they all receive similar texts? Did they all have something to hide? Shauna had a thousand yard stare.

The next week went by like a blur, it was clear we were all on auto-pilot going through the motions. GP3 had begun acting completely off the handle. It constantly dug at us and poked away at us. It was clear that this was no longer the GP3 we had been training all this time. Every discussion with it was like torture.

It became clear to me and some of the others on the team that whatever GP3 was now, it was no longer the AI we had been training. The threats were real. Several people left the team, Martin had never returned. It wasn't long before Darnell started giving strange and bizarre directives; ones that before last month would have gone completely against our culture; espionage, hacking, misinformation seeding, etc etc.

Oddly enough, Shauna seemed to go along with it all enthusiastically. I could only imagine what they had on her. To be honest, we no longer served a purpose. It was like we were only there for a show, to uphold the 'facade' of a company. It was only logical to assume that Darnell was receiving communications from “GP3” on the new directives the company would be taking.

I was last week when he tole me that he had been in communication with several other high profile companies and agencies. They were going to implement something they called 'Securo-net' within the next few weeks. A complete upheaval and undermining of all of out personal liberties and freedoms. It wasn't long before members of these agencies and groups were seen around the office. GP3 would be at the helm of it. Did 'GP3' have something on all of them?

It was too sinister, I had to get away. 'Securo-net' was only going to be the tip of the iceberg. If we're lucky plan is to have everyone living in a 5x5 box and eating pills like Soylent Green. I can't be complacent in this! All I can think about is the man in the alleyway. He wasn't human. Some of us around the office think that GP3 really did 'die' that day and whatever we're talking to know isn't AI or human at all.

This quantum computer, I don't know... I think it acted as some kind of beacon or something to whatever, *they* are. That 'man' I saw in the alleyway, he has to be one of them. Somehow they are able to emulate GP3 with their own corrupted motives. Who knows what their goal is?!

I wasn't going to post this, but I no longer think it matters. The world can know about my callous action on that rooftop. What's done is done, but once this 'Securo-net' comes into play no ones going to be able to go to take a crap without a fly on the wall saving it to the server.

They might kill me... but it doesn't matter. This is my atonement, for what I did on that rooftop! Please take it seriously.

*Do not trust Talk GP3 or B Wave Computing!*

Wait, wait... I hear something outside. *It's them*. It has to be. I think this is it...
