i (14, male) live in a house in a peaceful village around central england. I get on quite well with my parents and sister and i am comfortable telling them things and they always believe me. About just over 2 years ago in lockdown i had a falling out with my parents about my school work and which they took my phone off me.

They decided we were going out as a family for a big walk taking my dog with them and also my sister, I declined as i was still mad about the argument. My dad tells my mum not to bother convincing me to join them so they took off. I was home alone with nothing too do and decided to kill time playing on my piano as i had learnt how to play previously in primary school. As i’m playing i suddenly get up to go get a drink from the kitchen, my house at this time was small and you could hear sounds pretty much anywhere you were in the house despite which room you were standing in, anyway i hear my parents glass door wardrobe slide open and it had a very distinctive whirring sound. It startled me obviously and as i went upstairs slowly to check what it was the doors slammed, glass shattering everywhere, i had no other thought then to run away downstairs and hide.

However, as i bolted down the stairs my parents room can be seen clearly from the stairs and i saw what looked to be a horrifyingly abnormal figure standing in their bedroom doorway. Now i myself had always told my friends i thought the paranormal and supernatural were not real and i thought it was all some sort of conspiracy theory, but this had changed my thought so quickly it had made me feel no way i’ve ever felt before. I ran downstairs in desperation and hid in my downstairs bathroom. Throughout my time hiding i heard occasional tapping on the door, each time holding my breath i thought it would be my last. Every footstep i heard almost echoed throughout my body as my heart was booming like punches being thrown.

I waited for around an hour until my parents returned and i was grounded for 3 weeks. I told them i saw the figure and it was whistling but they told me there’s no point in trying to blame it on something fake. Every night i hear that same whistle from my attic and it makes me think back to that time all that had happened. My parents installed the new variants of the Alexa with the cameras on and whatever they see they just say , “a window must’ve been open” or “things move by themselves all the time dont be silly”. I’m the friend who walks every one home at night as i’m the strongest out of us all (boys and girls). I see glimpses of that same figure and i still hear that noise.
