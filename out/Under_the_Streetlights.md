Someone was sleepwalking outside my house.

  
I’m a journalist in Atlanta by trade, but in my spare time, I dive into the curious and the unexplained. I’ve always been drawn to mysteries, the kind that most people wouldn’t ever hear about. The kind that slips through the cracks of everyday life.

  
I live in a quiet, unassuming neighborhood. The kind where everyone has clicks but doesn’t bother to get to know everyone. I still live at home with my mother. Not because I need to, she would just be very lonely if I ever moved away. I do plan to eventually. At least when I find a partner, I’ll have to break the bad news.

  
My bedroom is on the second floor, with a perfect view of the street below and, more importantly, a direct line of sight down the neighborhood. The window in my room has become my personal portal to the world outside, a stage where the mundane and the mysterious intersect.

  
It all started a few weeks ago. I had taken my usual dose of sleeping pills, but sleep was elusive that night. I turned in an article I worked on for months to a big newspaper the other week.

  
 It was a huge story about a guy stealing from sheds in neighbors backyards. I interviewed several people talking about the items the theft stole and how the theft broke inside the sheds. I organized the information well. However the newspaper rejected it. Said it’s a local newspaper story at best. And because the theft was caught after three houses the story was too short.

  
I spiraled out of control. Barely left my room for several days. My mom was concerned. Usually in times like these I would be thinking about ending things. However my mom took good care of me. She had these pills I would take to stay happy. However when I took those happy pills, I could never sleep.  
 Tossing and turning, I finally gave up and wandered to the window, hoping the monotonous view of the empty street would lull me back to bed.

  
That’s when I saw him. A figure, illuminated by the soft glow of a distant streetlight. The man's movements were slow and unsteady, his silhouette hunched and distorted. I watched in pure confusion as the mysterious figure shuffled down the deserted street. At first, I thought I was dreaming. Or maybe the pills had conjured this spectral figure, a phantom of my restless mind.

  
His feet dragged along the ground, his shoes worn and tattered. The closer he got, the more my curiosity grew. My heartbeat quickened, and a chill ran down my spine. Was this real? Or was it a hallucination induced by the pills?

  
As the clock read 3:15 AM, doubt crept into my mind. My eyes flickered between the clock and the peculiar sight outside my window. The silence of the night amplified every sound—the rustle of leaves, the distant hum of traffic, and my own ragged breathing. My pulse quickened, a sense of unease settling over me like a suffocating blanket.

  
In the oppressive silence of my room, my grip on reality began to fray. I took a step back from the window, my breath quickening as the figure reached the EDGE OF MY DRIVEWAY.

  
My eyes remained glued to the figure, now closer than ever. The figure paused, lifting its head slightly as if sensing my gaze. It was a man. He was large, had some facial hair, and his eyes were wide open. They were glazed over, almost as if he was in a trance. He was looking up at my house. There was a cluelessness in his eyes, a haunting emptiness that sent a shiver down my spine.

  
I couldn’t stand to watch anymore. I closed the curtains, my heart pounding in my chest. The room’s silence was broken only by the distant hum of my fan overhead and my own ragged breathing. I felt a strange mix of fear and curiosity, the boundary between reality and nightmare blurring.

  
I was heading back to bed when the fear overtook me. What if he was still outside staring? What if he was coming to the house? What if he knocked on the door?

  
 What if he wanted to get me?

  
I gained the strength to head straight towards the window. I peeked through the small gap in the curtains. However, I saw nothing. Just an empty street lit yellow by the streetlights. The figure had vanished, like a ghost dissipating into the night.

  
I opened my window, letting the cool breeze wash over me. I poked my head out, scanning the front yard. Nothing but fresh-cut grass from the day before. I looked around and didn’t see him. But then I heard it—the sound of SHOES DRAGGING AGAINST THE CONCRETE, faint but unmistakable, echoing down the street.

  
The next morning was a Saturday. My mom made a large breakfast for the two of us, and she would talk about the most interesting takes on current events from strange news sources. The smell of bacon and eggs filled the air, a comforting contrast to the eerie events of the night before.  
I decided to ask her about it.

  
 *“Mom, I was up late last night writing,”* 

  
*“That’s why your eyes are so droopy,”*

  
*“There was a guy on the street walking weirdly.”*

  
*“A man walking? At what time?”*

  
*“Three in the morning.”*

  
*“I think I did see something about that in our neighborhood Facebook group.”*

  
 She put on her glasses and looked through her phone. I finished my plate before she found the post about it.

  
*“Here. Someone saw a guy sleepwalking in the neighborhood late at night too. This was two weeks ago.”* 

  
She showed me the post. It read, "Neighbor sleepwalking late at night. If you recognize this man, please warn him..." There was a video underneath. I clicked it. From a front window, a woman recorded the man passing by her house like a zombie. She was panicking while holding the phone to record. She turned on the outside lights to see him more clearly. The man just continued on his way.

  
*“Was that the guy?”*

  
*“Yes, he was.”*

  
I clicked on the post to read more. Comments underneath mostly said things like “OMG,” “Who is that?” or emojis of scared faces. But one comment read, “Is that Mr. Sinclair?”  
It all hit me at once. The man, I felt like I knew him. It could have been my best friend’s dad. He lived in the next house over.

  
I still don’t know for sure if that is who I saw, but I’m sure I will see him again. I am always up late working on some half-baked articles or drinking from my mom’s liquor cabinet.  
I want to know more. I wasn’t scared of an unconscious man.

  
 After breakfast, I went to my room and wrote down all these notes on paper. I will translate this later. I made a few calls to some friends. I think they could help me.

  
Please if you know anything about this, contact me.

  
Should I write a full article about this? Or maybe I could get this on camera. A documentary perhaps?
