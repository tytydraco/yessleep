( I asked him to explain what happened)

I remember thinking humanity had finally passed the point of no return. The point when God had finally had enough of us. Pearl Harbor had just happened a few months before that night and we were one day closer to yet another world war, another great purge of life itself. At some point, you’ve got to stop and wonder what that must look like to the creator of life, no?

Tensions had been high in the States for some time but the truth is we had our shelter built in the basement with no real intention of ever using it. We listened to the bunker salesmen’s sermon on how the end was nigh but I was never really convinced that we’d need it. Liz on the other hand was the one who really kept trying to sell me on the idea even after the guy went home for the day. I really did it for her peace of mind which was unfortunate because when the sirens first went off, we both looked at each other in such terrified disbelief that I think for a moment we actually forgot that we had the shelter.

Her eyes began to tear up just a few seconds into the sirens starting as it dawned on us both that the time had finally come. I remember kissing her hands as soon as she reached out to me and then running together, back when we could, straight down to the basement where the shelter had been waiting. I remember it seemed that with each step I was taking down into the basement, I was thinking of something new that I wish I had enough time to have brought down with us. At the top of the staircase I remember thinking “Wait, our photo albums”  Then “Our jewelry, my journals, Liz’s wedding dress” and before I knew it I was pulling that thousand-pound titanium door shut; Unsure if I would ever see those items again or if they would be lost in rubble by the time this was over.

The room gently rattled at the moment the door was finally sealed shut. And though there seemed to be an abundance of silence in the room, the sirens could still be heard faintly coming from above us.

“What’s going to happen, Walter?” I remember Liz asking while shaking uncontrollably. The truth was I didn’t have a clear answer to give but I did know what those sirens meant and I knew what was soon to follow. I decided to swaddle her in my arms and press one side of her face close to my chest and cover her other ear with my hand after whispering “It’s going to get loud but we’ll be okay”. Terrifying to have to lie like that to someone that you love. I was looking directly at the door and remember thinking that it felt as if the world was going to be bombed to oblivion right outside that titanium door and before long the world would be gone and me, Liz and the shelter would be floating in the vast emptiness of space in a matter of hours. And there was an odd sense of tranquility that accompanied the thought. Liz’s shaking began to slow and she wrapped her hands around my waist and at that moment realized that I had all I needed if the world was going to go to shit. Something about the idea of floating through the stars stuck with me and impulsively, I began humming Stardust by Artie Shaw. Poor choice of song at the time but it did wonders for Liz’s nerves. Before long we were passing the time by swaying back and forth, humming a relaxing tune, and awaiting whatever may come. That is until we realized something that could have been very good or very very bad.

The sirens had stopped.

We stood still and waited in a heavy silence for a while, still locked in each other's arms. After about five minutes, I realized that I had no way of knowing what was going on outside and that if there was anything I was going to go outside of the shelter for, it would need to be a radio. I gave the silence another five minutes before finally deciding to unlock the door. I remember telling Liz “I'm going to check outside and grab the radio on my way back. You grab everything you need but you be back in the shelter in no more than five minutes, do you understand?”. She nodded and we finally emerged from the shelter after waiting inside for about two hours.

“Was it a false alarm? Walter, tell me this was a false alarm!” Liz asked me with tears of relief in her eyes.

But the truth was, I had no idea. We crept quietly back upstairs, listening intently for any sounds, but there didn't seem to be any. While upstairs, Liz began rummaging through our cabinets and cupboards trying to collect anything important before returning to the bunker. I, on the other hand, went to the kitchen to grab our portable radio but as I was standing right next to our backdoor, I realized that it didn't sound like there was a single plane in the sky. I went outside and began scanning the skies as best I could for even the smallest indication of an ongoing raid, but the odd thing was, there were none. In fact, the entire city was dead silent for the first time in God knows how long.

It was cloudy that night and not much past the clouds can usually be seen at night due to the city’s light pollution but for that night in particular it was a bit harder to see the sky. Harder but not impossible, it seemed. From the corner of my eye, I thought I had noticed some movement coming from above me. A cluster of clouds was slowly passing and the night sky was visible for a brief moment but the strange thing was, the movement in that open gap hadn’t come from something in the clouds like a plane or a zeppelin, the movement was coming from out past the atmosphere as if something was moving far out in space.

I know I must sound insane and explaining it was never easy. The best way I could describe it is similar to how, if you're in a dark room with someone, you can see their movement. No other details about them are visible, other than just a shape moving. It was kind of like that at first.

As the clouds rolled back in and my view was once again obstructed, I had finally received that dreaded call that no air raid warden had ever wanted to get. It was time to suit up and head to one of the artillery outposts that were popping up all over the city that night.

I, along with some of my friends, had decided to enlist after Pearl Harbor, but out of the five of us, only myself and our old neighbor Tommy were selected to be air raid wardens in our hometowns. The protocol was that if we were ever to be under attack, an artillery outpost would be set up nearby, and no matter what, we would have to go in and be on standby. The one I got assigned to, that night, was at Griffith Park.

I remember, on the ride there, I didn’t pay much attention to the road in front of me at all. In fact, it was a miracle that I arrived at Griffith alive. The entire ride I was looking back and forth between the chaos and fear that was unfolding in the streets and the night sky; still trying to see what that movement out past the clouds really was. The light pollution was still too strong in the city, I knew I'd have a better view once I got to the outpost.

By the time I got there, I understood that people’s nerves were definitely high that night so it was no surprise that everyone stationed there was in a very morbid state of mind. There was no doubt that most of those people, like me, had just been pulled away from their families or loved ones and would much rather be with them if we were to have been attacked. I suppose I was last to have been called because  there were already about eight other soldiers setting up the equipment and looking to the sky.  As it turned out, one of the other soldiers at that outpost that night was Tommy, and HE, unlike the others, seemed to be in a chipper mood that night. Bringing to the outpost, the same positivity and enthusiasm he’d bring to our Sunday BBQs.

“Howdy Wally!” I remember him shouting from across the outpost.

He would say the same phrase every damn time he’d show up at our house. Most of the time he’d utter the words while carrying a casserole dish or a bag of charcoal, so in retrospect, it was funny hearing him say that while struggling to load an artillery shell. But at the time I didn’t think it was funny. Hell, I don't think I could have laughed if I had wanted to.  I just waved and went to check in with our Lieutenant.

Lucky for me I was assigned a telescope and put on watch duty for the night. Unlucky for me, however, so was Tommy. I could only imagine he would try to keep up that same picket fence rapport amidst what we thought was going to be our darkest or even final hours and I wasn't really ready for that.

As soon as I had my telescope set up, I began scanning any patch of sky that was not covered by clouds for that same movement that I had seen earlier. And again, looking back on it, I realize that it was very irresponsible to be looking for some movement instead of looking for Japanese airplanes like I should have been but, whatever, we didn’t get bombed that night anyways so it's fine.

Time, as well as Tommy’s yapping, seemed to have gone on for hours and I still had not seen anything similar to what I had witnessed earlier. For a moment I had begun to think that perhaps my eyes had just played a trick on me and that, while in my paranoid state, I had let my nerves get the best of me. I decided to push what I thought I had seen to the back of my mind and focus on the situation at hand. After all, the military still had us on high alert.

Eventually, the clouds had started to lighten up and the starry sky was a bit more visible than before. I still didn’t see any movement, nevertheless I did notice something in the sky that was a bit strange. I was scanning the sky horizontally when I realized that I had come across a patch of pure darkness. Essentially, I had come across a point in the sky where I couldn't see the stars anymore. Odd, right? So I moved my telescope along the same axis I was on but back in the opposite direction until I COULD see the stars again. There was no doubt that it was a bizarre occurrence but it wasn’t until I zoomed out that it occurred to me, the stars weren’t just stopping, there was something that was blocking them. I zoomed out a bit further and noticed that there was a trail of sorts that formed along the vertical axis; a point where the stars were stopping and the darkness was beginning. A point as clear as where the ocean meets land. I found myself following along that trail for a while; going along the edge, moving the telescope further up and up, then down after a large curve as if I was profiling the shape of mountains in the atmosphere. I did that three times until I couldn’t see any further. Three mountainous shapes were extending the whole horizon from Nevada to Seattle.

But three mountains in the sky? How?

I sat back in my chair, as confused as I was anxious, and looked around the outpost, aimlessly, just to clear my head. I remember seeing a group of officers standing around a table nearby when a terrifying thought entered my mind. I looked at the officers who were standing right next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, and realized that their heads and shoulders looked to be similar in shape to outlines I was tracing in the sky, just on a smaller scale. I wanted to shake that idea from my head. I really did. But when I remembered the movement that I had witnessed earlier, it made me think, were these shapes, these “mountains”...people?

My stomach turned at the prospect, and I even became a bit scared to look back up at the sky, much less, through my own telescope. But that quickly changed.

“The planes aren’t down here meathead!” My senior officer was shouting at me while pointing up at the sky. I really didn’t want to look. So I tried to have a cigarette while I did, just to try to keep myself calm. And let me tell ya. It didn't help.

A few minutes in, there was a big gap between the clouds again, so I decided to find that same trail where the stars were stopping and zoom out as far as my telescope could in an attempt to see the full scale of one of the three shapes. I wasn't able to see the whole thing but whatever I could see, I stared at it for a good while, just trying to figure out what in the hell I was actually looking at. While I was looking at it, I tried imagining the shape as a head and shoulders, thinking that maybe if I imagined it was such, it would move or act like it. Deep in my heart, I was terrified of the idea of those shapes being people and I didn't actually want it to move...

...but it did. *They* did.

At one point it turned slightly and slowly to the right as if it was talking to the shape next to it. I clearly remember thinking I wanted to abandon the post and haul my ass back to Liz and just hide in the basement with her for the rest of my life. You have to realize that on that night, it did seem like the end of days with everything that was going on, and seeing these three monolith shapes or people in the sky felt like we were living through judgment day and those were the judges in the sky. But I knew I wasn’t going to be a deserter, so I stuck it out.

I wanted to get my mind off of what was going on and what I was seeing. I knew I’d do anything to get those thoughts out of my head. In fact, I was so desperate that I did something that I would have never done outside of the situation we were in. I turned around to START a conversation with Tommy. Maybe hearing the mindless nonsense of his life would be enough to distract and get me through the night. The only thing that prevented me from talking with him was that when I turned to look at him, he was looking up at the sky in the same direction I had been, only his jaw was dropped, and trembling; looking as terrified as I was feeling. Immediately, I knew that he was seeing the same things I was, so I gently tapped him on the shoulder and called his name softly, hoping not to spook him but did so anyway. As soon as touched his shoulder, he jumped like a cat being startled by a mouse. He was panting. I asked him if he was alright and he stuttered for a moment, unsure of how to or IF he should explain what he was looking at. So I tried to level with him.

“Did you see something weird… up there?” I said pointing to the sky. Without even looking up, and with fear causing even his eyes to tremble, he muttered the words that I still can't seem to shake from my head.

“Something...Something’s watching us, Wally.”

I felt my heart sink into my stomach. Whatever was going on was not just some delusion; it was very much real. I tried to calm poor Tommy down, telling him that he wasn’t alone in what he was seeing. But for as many questions as he had, I had no more answers than he did. He kept wanting to know who or what we were looking at, or better yet, who or what was looking at us, and kept asking me as if I knew and was just hiding the truth from him. I pointed out that we had no way of knowing because it is hard to see with the rolling clouds and light pollution of the city. I told Tommy to try to relax and to just actually look for planes while I left to go take a leak.

It was about 3 AM when I left the outpost and hiked shortly up the Observatory Trails to find a secluded area where I could do my business. Once I found somewhere, I stared up at Mount Hollywood in a trance with my back turned to the city, trying hard to comprehend what was really going on that night. How did everything start as an attack, then turned a false alarm, full artillery on standby, and now something unexplained in the sky? None of it made any sense. The good news was that we were still not under attack, and before long, the sun would be rising and we could be better prepared for whatever the hell was actually going on. As for the shapes, maybe our telescopes were faulty or the city lights were somehow obscuring our vision with patches of darkness in the sky. Who could really say?

&#x200B;

As I was zipping up my pants and just at the exact moment that I was beginning to feel calm again, I noticed that it started to slowly become darker where I was, not harder to see exactly, but darker as if there were lights in the distance that were going out. I knew whatever was causing it couldn't have been good and my heart began to race as I reluctantly turned around. I was met with the petrifying sight of the sectors of the city going dark as each power grid was being shut off. Not long after, there were no more traffic lights, buildings became pitch-black edifices, and no one seemed to be out on the streets anymore. It was truly terrifying to see a once bright and vibrant city plummet into total darkness and despair, but, at that moment, I knew the true horror was lurking far above the city that night and I dragged my eyes slowly and hesitantly to the sky. I stood there; speechless.

&#x200B;

For a brief moment, I saw them. Whoever or whatever those things were. Three cosmic giants whose shadows of their frames extended the length of the horizon. There were two on the sides that looked to be still, just looking down at earth while the one in the middle looked to be pointing down directly at us. To this day, I still do not know why. All I knew at the time was that the finger that was pointing down at us looked to be getting closer as if we were an ant that it intended to squish. The shapes were easier to see without the light pollution and they were clearly some sort of extraterrestrial beings, but I still couldn’t see their faces or any details about them without a telescope.

“Shit! The telescope!”

As soon as I realized that, I heard a deafening scream coming from far in front of me. I began sprinting back to the outpost, looking up at the sky, as long as I could while the screams were slowly beginning to fade. Well, they didn't so much fade, but begin to be drowned out by the even more deafening sound of the air raid sirens blaring louder than the first time. I knew all hell was about to break loose.

When I finally got back, I saw a group of officers trying to restrain Tommy to the ground. He was jittering frantically and trying to run away while his finger was pointed up at the sky and he was shouting something that I couldn't hear. He was right at my feet, and couldn't have been more than a yard from me. I could tell he was screaming at the top of his lungs by his veins bulging out at the neck, yet I still couldn't hear him. That's how loud those sirens were.  Suddenly, everyone that was gathered around Tommy began looking up at the sky in the direction Tommy was pointing. By my estimate, it was the same area where the creature’s finger had been pointing as well, only the creature wasn't visible. All that was visible at the time were the searchlights that were coming from every outpost that had been constructed in the city, all being aimed at that same spot in the sky. I wanted to get a closer look at what the spotlights had converged on, but as I got close to my telescope, I along with much of the other equipment around us were knocked over by the disorienting quake of the artillery barrage that was beginning. Explosion after explosion filled the skies at that moment. I was blinded by the flashes and deafened by the erupting shells over the pitch-black city

It was true horror like I’d never felt before.

So much uncertainty and terror filled us that night. Even after the artillery barrage stopped and the sirens died out, many of us were left with some level of deafness for a day or two. Apparently, 5 people died that night, some from being spooked and some from the chaos in the streets. I found out later that the official verdict was that it was a rogue weather balloon that was mistaken for a UFO. A damn weather balloon, can you believe that? I know my version isnt much more believable, but you’re my grandson, you have to deal with my crazy stories. Tommy, on the other hand, was asked to give a statement on what occurred that night, as we all were brought in to do, and I guess whatever he said was enough to get him committed.

*(I asked if he was serious.)*

Yep. You can even ask Liz. There was one day in between when he gave his statement and when I was scheduled to give mine. And the morning of that day, the van from Metropolitan State was outside loading him up.

*(I asked if he had ever seen anything like that since.)*

Never. I ended up getting sent to Germany, fought all throughout Europe, and somehow made it back to live a beautiful life with your grandma, your dad, and your aunt. Almost every night since then, I’ve looked up at the sky to see if I’d ever see anything like that again. But I never did. The only thing that came close was when the war was over and we were briefly held up in Norway. That was the first time I had seen the northern lights and just how much it filled the sky and how little I felt underneath it, was the only thing that came close to what I felt that night. But during my time in the army, I had seen some truly horrific things, but it was...human.

Fighting and war are just some things we are sadly used to and understand well. So to me, when seeing those horrors, I knew that it was something the world had seen before and there was an

explanation for it. But whatever was in the skies that night, I don’t know who or even if anyone has ever seen anything like that again, and even if someone has, I doubt there is an explanation for them. Their existence is as much a cosmic mystery as our own.
