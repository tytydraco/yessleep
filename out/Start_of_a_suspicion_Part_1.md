I come to this sub to explain my situation. First time, but warranted. 

I will try and be as calm and collected as I can, despite what has happened to bring me here. 

I am Cy, (26). Erica, my long term gf, who will appear in this post is (21).

We had been dating for 3 years, and had just discussed moving in together. I was very happy that Erica wanted to take this step, and readily agreed. She had me move in with her, as my apartment was way more crappy than her house, which her parents had helped her buy. It was small, 1 bedroom with 1.5 bathrooms, but in a nice part of town and close to her work. My lease ended in a month, so I didn’t move in until then. 
When that day came, I moved my few possessions in my beat up car. I terribly poor, but money was tight. And I was frugal. Erica’s parents were wealthy business professionals that had their company take off, doting on their only child. They also seemed to really like me too, they’d welcomed me into their family like I was their own. So basically my life was looking up. I was so happy to move in with the love of my life, and take this step like I said. Erica came out when she saw me pull up and helped me carry stuff in. Her place was about a 40 minute drive from mine. Once everything was in, she made tea and I sat with her. We talked about how happy we were with this and just general small talk. 

Fast forward to that evening: 
We went out for dinner and then came home and watched tv. Erica had work in the morning, I was off. It was Saturday, I had Sat/Sun off, but Erica worked Sundays. Today was her last day off. We sat and watched some Tv, then started to head to bed. I slept on the couch, she slept in the bedroom, we weren’t quite ready to sleep together yet. 
Okay, so day 1 was fine. 

(Sunday) The next morning, Erica and me had coffee together. Then she left for work. I heard the mail come soon after (I guess it’s super early here) so I went out and checked. The elderly neighbor on the left came out at the same time. 
“How are you Cy? Are you staying over with Erica?” 

I smiled. This was Mrs.Latefield. I had meet her once or twice before when I had visited Erica at her place. She was a nice old woman, everything you’d expect of a widowed cat lady. 
“I am actually moved in with her as of yesterday.” I told her happily. 
She smiled, but it caught me off because she looked nervous all of a sudden. 
“Well I am happy for you of course Cy, but Erica hasn’t seemed like herself lately. She hasn’t been by in weeks and just seems distant, to me anyways. Be careful okay.” 

With this she turns and walks into her house. 
What’s that supposed to mean? I shrug and head back inside, but with a feint kind of with a creepy feeling that lingered. 

After spending the day finishing up with my stuff, Erica gets home. She brought carry-out for dinner. She seemed a bit tired, but still smiling and happy when we sat down together. After our usual small talk about the day, I brought Mrs.Latefield up. 

“So babe, I talked to our neighbor this morning at the mailbox, she says you haven’t come by in a bit and seemed concerned.”

Erica: “Oh, I was by twice in the last 2 weeks, I brought her her tea from the store as well as new cat food. She must have just forgotten in old age.” 

Huh, seems reasonable I guess. 
After that we just went back to normal conversation and watched tv again cuddled up together. Then I bedded myself down on the couch once Erica had left for her room. I had work the next morning and needed sleep. 

And I did sleep, until about 1. 
That’s when I heard something like footsteps. I sat up, waited, then heard them again. With the sound of a door closing. I got up and looked down the hall. The bathroom light was on. It was just Erica. I heard the sink a minute later. 

I went back to bed, the neighbors warning had put me on edge. I half laughed at myself for being so keyed up in my own love’s house. 

(Monday) 
I headed out for work, Erica would leave a bit later. I worked as manager for a fast-casual place. As I entered I was greeted by my 2nd in command and best friend Andres. We had been working together at this restaurant for a little over a year now, he’s one of the only faces that stuck around. 

“Hey, how are things Cy?”
He always is slightly loud, it comes from his enthusiasm and energy. So sweet though. 

“Pretty good, moved in with Eric a couple days ago.” I say in a slightly quieter voice. 
(Eric is what I call Erica.) 

“Hey, that’s great! Her house is on 7th right?” 

I nod.

Andres face darkens a bit. 

“Look Cy, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but there’s been 4 murders in your area, one was identified as a young woman, the others are haven’t been released, but all have horribly mutilated. The police haven’t found the suspect(s) and I just want you and Eric to be safe okay? What ever crazy is out there may still be in the area. Yenno?” 

I nod. I hadn’t heard any of this. Especially since the neighborhood was touted as being pretty safe. This was all strange news. I thanked Andres for telling me.

I again have a creepy feeling. 

After my shift I went home. Between being manager and having extra stressful thoughts on my mind I was tired. It would be 2 hours until Erica got home. 
So I decided to head over to Mrs.Latefield’s, despite wanting to take a nap. 

I knocked a couple times, then she answered. A cat was around her legs and she was holding another. She smiled upon seeing me. 
“What can I do for you Cy? Want to come in?” 

I nodded and managed a smile back. 

She showed me to a table and chairs set and sat down. The cat by her feet at the door sat next to her, while she still had the one in her arms. 

I wasted no time starting with my question. 

“I talked to Erica, she’s says she was her twice over the last 2 weeks, brought you tea and cat food?” 

Mrs.Latefield looked thoughtful.
“She might of been, you know it’s getting hard for me to remember in my old age. I still don’t really recall her being here though. She might have brought me the boxes of green tea with lemon…”

I could see I wasn’t really getting anywhere. 
“It’s okay, don’t press yourself. I just wanted to make sure you and Erica are at an understanding. Do you need anything as of this week?” 

She now smiles.

“No, I am good Cy, thank you. It’s okay about Erica too, I am sure she’s fine. I just can’t recall her bringing me anything, but don’t take it to heart okay?” 

I nod. Still kind of a strange situation. I don’t know what to think. She offers me tea, but I pass and head home. I decide to take a little nap on the sofa after all. Erica comes home after I had been awake for like 20 minutes. She’s seems okay. She brought food from the store home. 

After we ate we elected to go to bed, Erica invited me to sleep with her. I did, before we feel asleep I informed her about what Andres had said. She just nodded. 
Too horrible for words? Probably tired too ig. 

I lay awake for a bit, Erica fell right asleep. 
When I did sleep, I woke up at one again. 
I heard a strange but soft moan, like something in pain. I sat up. I heard it again a few minutes later and got out of bed. A cat perhaps? I walked down the hall and to the living room. 
What I saw shocked me so bad I was silently horrified. 

There on the couch was a sprawled body of a young woman. Her face and body was drenched in blood, so much so I couldn’t ID her. She was dressed in clothes, but they were badly torn. 
Like an animal had mauled her. 
I almost couldn’t blink, but when I did I opened my eyes and she was gone. 

I rushed over to check the couch, but there was no blood, no disturbance, nothing. 

Was I just seeing things? I must have been.
A horrible vision generated by stress and fear and worry. 

I went back to bed, Erica stirred a bit and asked me if I was okay. 

I just mumbled yeah. 
I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. 

I will have a post for the next day very soon, I will link the update when I am done.
