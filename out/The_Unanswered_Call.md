I always thought I'd have more time. More time to tell her how much she meant to me. More time to sit in her lap like I used to as a kid, even though I'd gotten too old for that. But time ran out when the phone rang on that icy November night, and the officer on the other end of the line said the words I never thought I’d hear.

My mom was gone.

They said the accident happened fast. She didn’t suffer, or at least that’s what they told me. But it didn’t matter because the world suddenly felt like it had collapsed. Dad was stationed across the world, unreachable for days, and I was left alone in a house filled with all the memories that once made me feel safe. Everyone tried to help. Family, friends—they came over, they brought food, they hugged me, but none of it made a difference. None of them could fill the void she left behind.

I wanted to talk to her, even just once more. I needed to hear her voice. Maybe then I could sleep again without waking up to the sound of my own sobbing.

  
That’s when the idea came to me. Late at night, when the house was dark and quiet, and the ache in my chest kept me from closing my eyes, I started searching. I didn’t even know what I was looking for at first—just something, *anything*—that could help me talk to her again. Maybe it was stupid, but I found comfort in reading stories about people who had reached the other side. The more I read, the more I thought it might actually be possible.

There were forums. People talking about spirits, séances, rituals. Most of them were probably just trying to scare each other, but one night, I found something different. A woman who claimed she could help me. She told me about a ritual, said it was old, and that it worked. She even offered to send me the book.

I knew it was crazy. But I couldn’t stop myself. A week later, a small package arrived in the mail—no return address, just my name scribbled on the front. Inside was an old leather-bound book, its pages yellowed and fragile. My fingers trembled as I turned the pages, reading about symbols, rituals, candles, and the thin veil between our world and theirs. The book promised contact—direct, clear, undeniable.

The instructions were simple. Too simple.

  
I waited until night, of course. I didn’t want anyone interrupting. Not even my friends, who had grown increasingly concerned about me. They knew I was spiraling, but no matter how much they tried to help, nothing worked. They didn’t understand. How could they? They still had their mothers.

When I told them what I was planning, they were horrified. "Don’t do it," Emily had said, grabbing my arm. "This is dangerous." But I had already made up my mind.

They stayed, though. Outside my room, lingering just beyond the door. They didn’t want me to do it alone, but they didn’t dare come inside.

I sat on my bedroom floor, drawing the circle as the book instructed. The symbols were strange, twisting shapes I couldn’t quite recognize, but I copied them exactly. In the center of the circle, I placed my mother’s necklace—a small, silver pendant she’d worn every day of her life. A single candle flickered beside me, casting long shadows that danced on the walls.

The book said I needed something to communicate with. It suggested a Ouija board, but I didn’t have one. I wanted to hear her voice, so I used my phone. It was stupid, but in that moment, nothing else mattered.

I began reciting the words. The ancient, foreign syllables felt wrong in my mouth, but I spoke them anyway, my voice shaking. When I finished, I waited. The candle flame sputtered, and the room seemed colder somehow, but nothing happened.

I almost laughed at myself, almost told my friends it had been a mistake. But then my phone rang.

The name on the screen stopped my heart. **Mom.**

I stared at the screen for what felt like an eternity, my fingers numb. This wasn’t possible. It couldn’t be possible. But I answered anyway, putting the phone on speaker.

"Hello?"

The silence stretched, thick and heavy, until a voice broke through. "Sweetheart…"

My throat closed up. I knew that voice. I knew it better than my own. "Mom?" I whispered, tears springing to my eyes.

"I’m here, baby. I’m right here."

I sobbed, my whole body trembling. It felt like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders. I couldn’t believe it. I had done it. I had really done it. "I miss you so much," I choked out. "I don’t know what to do without you."

"You don’t have to do anything, honey. I’m still with you. I’ll always be with you."

We talked. I told her about the days since she’d been gone, about how empty everything felt without her. And she listened, just like she always had. For a few precious moments, it felt like everything was normal again. Like she wasn’t really gone.

But then her voice changed.

"Where’s your father?" she asked suddenly, the warmth draining from her tone.

I frowned. "Dad’s still overseas. Why?"

"And who’s outside your room? I can hear them."

I glanced at the door. "That’s just Emily and the others. They were worried about me. But it’s okay, they’re not coming in."

"Take the phone to them."

I froze. "What?"

"Take the phone to them, sweetheart. Let me talk to them."

"I—I can’t. The phone has to stay in the circle. That’s what the book said."

Her voice grew sharp. "You never could follow directions, could you?"

My heart sank. Something was wrong. The way she said that—it didn’t sound like her. "Mom, what’s going on?"

"You were always such a disappointment," the voice spat. "Your father and I never wanted you. We never loved you."

I felt like I had been slapped. "That’s not true."

"Oh, but it is. You were a mistake. He was going to leave us because of you."

Tears welled in my eyes. I couldn’t breathe. "Stop it. Please stop."

But the voice only grew crueler. "You think he loves you? You think I loved you? You were a burden, and we resented you every day of your miserable life."

Something inside me snapped. "Tell me my name," I demanded, my voice shaking. "If you’re really my mother, tell me my name."

The silence on the other end was deafening.

Then, the voice laughed. It was deep now, male, and mocking. "I oversold it, didn’t I? Couldn’t resist."

My stomach twisted in horror. "Who are you?"

"Does it matter? You wanted to talk to her, and I was happy to oblige."

I scrambled to blow out the candle, but the flame wouldn’t die. I reached for the phone, but the voice stopped me.

"Wait! Don’t hang up. I can still help you. You want to talk to your mother? I can arrange that. All you have to do is take the phone out of the circle."

I shook my head, backing away from the phone. "No. I’m done with this."

The voice snarled. "You’ll regret this, little girl. Your mother will pay for what you’ve done today."

I hung up.

The candle went out.

I stumbled out of my room, barely able to breathe. My friends rushed to me, their faces pale with worry. "What happened? Are you okay?" Emily asked, grabbing my arm.

I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t think. I just let them pull me out of the house, away from the room, until the air outside finally calmed my racing heart.

It was over. It had to be over.

Hours later, I returned to my room. Everything was still. My phone lay in the circle, untouched. But there was a new notification.

A voicemail.

I knew I shouldn’t, but my fingers moved on their own, pressing play.

The sound of my mother’s screams filled the room.
