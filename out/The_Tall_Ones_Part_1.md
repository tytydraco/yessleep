"Bzzzzzzzzt -toona, Des Moines, and Waukee. Please stay safe, folks."

I swatted at a no-see-um flittering lazily around my face, highlighted as a golden silhouette in the god-ray peeking through the dreary, smoke-grey sky. The yellow glow gave new life to the smattering of trees along the road, now lush with vibrant green leaves, the thick grass of the meadows skirting the edge of the corn fields, themselves brimming with 6-foot tall stalks, swaying gently in the breeze that carried the light, embarrassingly nostalgic smell of cow dung across the plains. 

The god-ray passed into the gathering clouds. It was getting ready to rain soon, surely. Even for mid-July in central Iowa, it was awfully warm, but it was late afternoon and bound to cool down as the sun set. At the bottom of the hour, the radio I keep tucked into the side pouch of my backpack tuned to 94.9 (the only station that plays music I could tolerate) announced it was a balmy 104 degrees, so go ahead and add five hundred thousand percent humidity to that.

I made a commitment at the beginning of the year to not be such a lazy slob. Stop drinking, stop eating fast food, and get out of my computer chair and go for walks, if not the gym thirty minutes down the road. The fact that the air outside felt like I was encased in a cube of hot water won't change that just yet.

It's funny, I grew up in the middle of nowhere, a little house in a tiny subdivision with thirteen houses surrounded completely by corn and soybean fields (this year was corn, next year would be soybeans), with nothing and no one stopping me from exploring as far as I can see, and every day I go out a little bit further and see something I haven't before.

In Iowa, that's hard to do. You can stand flat-footed and watch your dog run away for three days in this state, for lack of even a foot of difference in elevation.

But Patton, Iowa is home. It's where my mom brought me and my sister when my junkie dad gave up custody. I abjectly hate it here, I wish I could leave, but my failure-to-launch self was still making just above minimum wage and even in Nowheresville that gets you about one corner of a studio apartment in a basement.

I remember when my mom brought us here, going on about all the frie-

"WAAAAAAAAAAAH"

My radio, a relic of my dad's that I still use, blasted like a foghorn, scaring the shit out of me and into the next county. It wasn't the typical, scratchy static that you usually expect when a radio signal comes in bad, it was constant, loud, and incredibly obnoxious. Knocked me straight out of my daydream.

"AAAAAAH- bzzzzzzt... -olks, sorry about that, must be some bad vibes in the air today! Anyways, here's The Offspring on 94.9 KGGO, Des Moines Classic Rock."

"*Weird,"* I thought. "*They must have heard it on their end."*

Must have been some kind of equipment malfunction over at the station.

My mind went wild as I walked along the country roads off I-44, already bored, but jittering from the sudden disruption and having a little fun getting creative with it. UFO, maybe? Or maybe the ghost of the first DJ at the station, trying to claw his way back onto the airwaves.

That carried me some distance, and I hardly noticed how far I was walking from my mom's house. I didn't even notice that I'd crossed the road several times and made several turns while I was coming up with a name for the phantom DJ (Big Stan was what I landed on, feel afraid!). I was now on the edge of a cornfield I didn't recognize, which was a joke because they all looked alike. Really, what didn't look familiar to me was the trees. One gnarled oak right in front of me was trimmed to let power lines pass over it, and looked vaguely like an eagle with spread wings. On the other side of the street was an old barn, red paint flaking off ancient, weathered grey wood. The short driveway leading up to it was completely grown over, so this one must have been abandoned decades ago.

To compound the slight pang of concern that rose in my chest at the thought of having to navigate a way home in the coming dark from a place I'm unfamiliar with, I could see a fog embankment rolling in. Thick, soupy shit that most certainly was also going to indicate heavy rain.

No sooner did I realize this was going to be a problem than the hot breeze I'd felt like a hair dryer blowing in my face on low all afternoon was replaced by a chill gust. Not just cool air, but *cold* and jarring for the difference. I felt like if it the wind wasn't strong I could probably see my breath.

Just like every kid that went to elementary school in Iowa, my mind immediately went to the mandatory seminar you get every school year about signs of tornadoes. Hot air mixing with cold was danger territory, but there was no lightning, no thunder, no hail.

The radio began buzzing again, this time a little more traditionally.

"Hkkkkkkt -inside a solid structure and avoid all windows and anything that can be broken. A basement, if you can. This applies to the foll- bzzzzzzzzzt."

It just occurred to me, it'd probably been doing that a while. After that loud foghorn-like sound, I had turned down the radio and got into my own head.

"*Shit,"* I thought. "*That sounds like a tornado warning."*

It also occurred to me that this storm must be a wrecking ball if it's affecting the radio like that. Along with being depressingly flat, the plains are incredibly good for radio signals.

The fog was rolling in fast from the east. It was swirling wickedly, looking like what I could only imagine heavy seas looked like, but vertical. This looked bad.

I looked around again. Aside from a handful of trees I could see, including the eagle oak, the road, and corn fields, all there was that could possibly offer shelter was the barn.

"*I could do worse,"* I thought. At least it was a building.

I crossed the rutted dirt road, now getting pattered with fingernail-sized rain drops. I picked up my pace and got to the door. It had a big Stanley padlock on it, but for my good fortune, the hinge it was attached to was rotted off. I grabbed the door and slid it to one side, slowly. It was a big door, and the track it slid on was backing off the structure just like everything else seemed to. The screws holding it in place seemed like they were holding on for dear life.

The smell of dust and rotten hay filled my nostrils as the inky blackness of the barn's interior exposed itself to me.

I took a tentative step inside as the wind began to pick up more, whipping at my face like a cold lash. I immediately heard the skittering of tiny claws from thirty different places all at once as rats scrambled into their cramped hiding places.

I shivered, partly from the cold, but partly from being inside a creepy old barn. As my eyes adjusted, I could make out shapes. Vertical beams that held up the hay loft, horizontal ones that made up the stables. Cobwebs thick enough to look like sheep's wool in the corners closest to the door, and undoubtedly all through the darkest places.

Then I saw something that send deep, penetrating chills down my spine and put my hair on end.

Two glowing yellow dots, close together. Moving. Eyes. Eyes that were fixed on me, studying me.

I took a step back, my own eyes wide with horror. The glowing yellow orbs were getting closer.

The moment I even thought about turning around to run, the yellow, piercing eyes sprinted at a phenomenal speed toward me.

"FUCK!" I screamed, and fell flat on my ass.

As the deer that those yellow orbs belonged to ran headlong past me, probably more scared than I was though I fail to believe it, I let about two seconds' worth of piss out of me before I could gather myself. It was right about this point that I noticed a faint grey light in the far corner of the barn. There must be a goddamn door open back there, the deer was probably doing the same thing I was, getting out of the damn rain.

Speaking of, the rain was beating pretty hard on the roof of the barn now. It was coming down incredibly hard out there.

"WAAAAAAAAAAAH" went my radio, and I committed to another two seconds of piss.

"Fuck me to tears!" I said out loud, to nobody.

I scrambled for the volume knob again, turning it until it clicked to indicate it was powered off. The insanely loud foghorn sound was gone, and I could confidently say that I had now pissed myself, although thank God for small miracles, since I had been pretty well rained on before getting inside, it was hard to tell. Not that there was anybody to see.

I reached into my bag and grabbed the pen light I always keep on me, an aluminum AAA-powered gadget with a pocket clip. I shined it around the barn, and wasn't surprised in the least. Cobwebs everywhere, thick as bedsheets, rotting wood and hay that was slowly turning into dust.

I walked through the barn, satisfying my curiosity while I waited for the storm to pass, or the tornado to rip me halfway to Chicago. It hadn't been used in some time, but there were signs that it was intended to be. An old handsaw hanging from a wall, a tack hammer resting on a workbench, a five-gallon bucket from Ace Hardware. The bucket said "The place with the helpful hardware man," so it'd been there for a good while. Now the radio ads say "the place with the helpful hardware folks." Must be more inclusive.

I was afraid to, for multiple reasons, but I decided to check out the stables. I just *knew* there was going to be a rat the size of a fucking donkey in there.

I shined my light through the first stable and saw nothing but a mound of composting hay and a length of rusted chain. The second stable didn't have a chain.

In the third, I nearly jumped out of my skin, but managed to keep the modest amount of piss I had reserved inside. As I shined my flashlight over, I saw a ribcage. I shined the narrow beam further, and saw a skull.

"Jesus," I said. "Somebody left a goddamn calf in here."

At least, I think it was a calf. Too small to be a cow or a horse, could be a goat. That was enough for me, though, the remaining three stables could go-

"WAAAAAAAAAAH" my radio blasted again.

"For fuck's goddamn sake!" I shouted, wrapping my ears in my hands. The foghorn sound continued blasting in my ears as I fumbled around for my radio. I grabbed it and yanked it from its' pouch before I remembered.

I had turned it off.

I stood, wide-eyed, looking at my analog radio, the tiny light that should be green to let me know it was powered on staring back at me, a dark unlit olive color.

The sound stopped. I took my hand off my other ear. Now it was silent outside, aside from the sound of the rain hitting the barn. The sound of wind hitting the broad side of the barn from the east was gone.

"*What the fuck,"* I thought. "*What the fuck what the fuck what the fu-"*

Then I heard something else. I strained to figure out what it was, it was nothing I'd ever heard before. The closest I could come to quickly was it sounded like someone was dropping a pallet full of meat on the ground over and over, fast.

Then crashing. The sound of wood splintering outside. The barn went pitch black, then slightly lit again. The meat sound stopped.

Then skittering again, but this time louder. I shined my light frantically and saw the rats, like a giant brown rug, running from their hiding spots in every direction. Hundreds of them, all running away from the barn.

I've seen horror movies. I'm not fucking going outside to see what the hell is going on. I tried to calm myself down. In school they said that a tornado will sound like a freight train, maybe that's the sound? Why was it on the radio? What the fuck is going on?

It occurred to me that whatever that sound was, it would comfort me if it was a tornado.

I stalked quietly to the aging but thick wood ladder leading up to the hay loft. I'd left the door to the barn open, I didn't see a reason to close it, but no way am I getting near the outside of this barn. Up in the hay loft, I could see a little stream of grey light.

I climbed up the ladder, wincing at the heavy groan each rung made as I climbed up. I have no idea why to this day, but something told me to stay quiet. I made no sound, even as I climbed through the thick cobwebs covering the hatchway into the loft.

The loft was well-stocked with hay before its demise. Bales were stacked high in here, but the smell of rot hit me like a wall the instant I entered. In some places, the only sign that the pile of mush I was looking at was once hay at all was the baling wire sticking out of it. I could see some light coming through the main doors on the floor below through missing planks, of which there were a lot.

I walked slowly to the source of the dim grey light in the loft, a door at the far end of the floor. Really more like a glassless window with a hatch covering it, probably for loading hay from a truck on the ground. As I approached, the light faded to darkness. I swallowed and noticed I was shaking like a leaf.

I fumbled at the rusty jay-hook holding the hatch closed and released it. I pushed the hatch open slightly, rain splattering the top of it and spraying onto me. I couldn't care less right now. I'm scared out of my mind and wet with piss and rain anyways.

I looked through the crack in the hatch. It was pitch black outside. Whatever was going on, it was too dark to see. At what must be pretty close to 7 pm in the summer, this storm was making it look like it was the middle of the night.

I took a step back and sat down on some mushy old hay, staring out of the cracked hatch. Immediately I was struck with the smell of fresh earth, of moss and old ground. The smell of rot was strongest. It didn't smell like the decaying hay, it smelled like a rotten carcass.

I must be in the thick of it. This has got to be the storm of the goddamn century. But where was the wind? The lightning?

Slowly, the dim grey light began peeking back through the hatch.

It...it was wrong. It didn't come back in all at once, it was like something was being peeled off that window.

My jaw went slack, and again my eyes went wide as I watched. As the darkness dropped from the hatch, top to bottom, I could swear I saw...

"*Was...was that hair?"* I thought, my blood turning to ice.

The sound of crunching. The sound of wet meat, but this time it was different.

I inched slowly toward the crack and peeked out, trying desperately to control my breathing, which was coming in panicked rasps. I could just about make out the eagle oak tree. Almost half of it, one of its' "wings," was dangling. Nearby, I could tell a power line was dangling next to it.

The smell of moss was strong right here. Something must have stirred up dirt, maybe the deer.

Then I saw something moving through the fog, across the street in the corn fields. At first I thought it might be a combine, but it was too tall. I couldn't make out what it was, but it was moving through the field, slowly and steadily. The fog was whirling around it like a cloak.

I thought about calling out, but thought better. Something wasn't right.

I looked down toward the driveway leading to the front entrance of the barn. Laying there was the head of a young deer, a buck. I think it was the one that scared the piss out of me in the barn. On the neck-end was a trim of gore and blood splattered like it had fallen from outer fucking space. It was opening and closing its' mouth rhythmically, but slowing.

"*Oh my god. That thing just died, like right now just died."*

Whatever took that fucking deer's head off did it *very* recently. If it's still twitching like that, it-

The light blotted out from the hatch, bottom to top this time, quickly. 

*Something just stood up.*
