Btw I translated this the best I could sorry if there are any mistakes
The first page was written when she was 8. She says "my mother taught me how to hunt, she told me how to figure out the best things to hunt. I don't like hunting I feel bad for the animals but some of them I dont feel any remorse for. Like those ones that pretend to be deers and bears but once you try and kill them they change into their real form.

 My mother taught me how to spot them and she showed me the signs, the most obvious thing that reveals them is their silvery eyes. You can see them from a mile away, the way they glow in the snowy winters. Their true form is like a mix between a bloody skeleton and a reindeer on its back two legs. It's hands are deformed and grotesque like an animal who just slaughtered another one, one much much bigger than them self. The one time I fell for it was when it was pretending to be a bunny. I walked over to it and was going to feed it some berries but then it transformed into the grotesque version of what ever they are. I grabbed my bow and arrow and shot it in the head. But that wasn't enough. It charged at me but than fully my mother was close bye and pushed me out of the way and stabbed it in the eye with her knife. Finally it was dead. But my mother was deeply wounded I dragged her to the cabin and put gauze on her wounds and cleaned them up. I had to let her rest."


 The next pages are all about her boring life in the cabin with her mother but an actually interesting thing happened on her 9th birthday. "My father has never been present in the cabin but when ever I ask my mom what happened to him she avoids the question. When I went to bed on my birth day I heard whispers from someone who sounds like a male my first thought was that it was my dad but when I listened closer I realized it wasn't anything good It was saying that I had to go out side in to the woods so I did because I thought that nothing would be out there. When I went outside I noticed the weird symbols on the trees. Some had an hourglass on it and others had pictures of the shapeshifters. The voice told me told go to the cliff edge I was suspicious but I thought it was god or something, I thought I was about get blessed or something. Once I got there I looked around and saw.... something, it looked human but I knew that could not be right it was right behind me. It looked burnt, like it was just extinguished after being burnt alive. It looked like an evil spirit pretending to be human. It didn't do very well. I took my hunting knife and stabbed it as soon as I did it turned in to a dust and blew away in to the wind. I ran back home and asked my mother what happened but she didn't have an explanation." In a later page she mentions this page and says. "I know now what that thing was and I know why it wanted me there, living in these woods you learn what these things are and how to fight back against them."

When she was 16 this happened..." My mother is dead I don't know why she just won't wake up. Now I will have to live by myself and do everything my self. I ventured out in to the woods to hunt and thankfully found a deer, I sneak up to it and kill but when I do I hear a voice, fearfully I ready my bow and look around. I can't see anyone. It sounded like a person in pain, I know that it wasn't the deer. It sounded a bit like a man. Memories back from when I was 9 flood back to me. I run back In to the cabin and cook and eat the deer. These days In My life were the most boring I hunt I eat I sleep and then I repeat it every single day. I decided that I am going to Adventure out In to the woods in a part of it that I have never been to before.

Once I arrive there I immediately start seeing these creatures that I have never seen before. I ready my bow and start shooting at them. One of them start charging at me but I wait until the last second like how my mother taught me to deal with bucks. I sidestep and stab the beast. I keep one of its horns as a decoration. I get too scared to keep exploring and run back to my cabin." The rest of the pages are blank until the last one and it says" today I might be dead later. I went out to the cliff edge and sat down on the edge. But that same voice I heard when I was nine starts talking to and says that I can't kill it or else horrible things will happen to me so I sit still and don't move a muscle. I scream you don't scare me the voice responds and says that I am scared, and I was I didn't know what to do, I think about what my mother would do. She would run back to the cabin and protect me, but no one is here to protect me I have to protect myself. I run right to the cabin and lock myself into my mother's room. And hum the lullaby she used to sing to me. I can the thing walking over to me while I'm writing this. I have to hide In the closet once I get in the closet the thing walks In. It says that he will find me soon. I start praying and once I finish my prayer the voice disappears. I get out of the closet and take a nap now that I know I'm safe. I'm sick of writing all of this I am done."


Now I want to visit where ever she grew up and write my experiences. Who nows maybe one day I will. I hope you enjoyed reading this diary with me. Sincerely David Simmons.
