“Please shut the fuck up” I say as I turn off my alarm, “thank you!”.

Another day of running on five, MAYBE six hours of sleep. I know its slowly killing me, but at this point, I have other shit to worry about.

“It’s that time again…”  
I pop my daily dose of reality pill, and the bottle feels incredibly light.

“Damn, only three more?”

Three more pills, meaning three more days until I’m out of the thing that keeps me grounded. Time for a trip to the pharmacy.

“Good morning, Ms. Frederickson.”

“Good morning, Mr. Dawson, how are you feeling today?”

I hate this question, and I hate having to lie to tell an ‘acceptable’ answer.

“Not too bad, just *trying* to hunt for the good, you know.”

“Anyway, I’m running low on my risperidone, and I only have enough to last me three more days, and I’m here for my monthly refill.”

“Okay! Let me check to see if it’s ready to be picked up, I’ll be right back.”

I’ve been coming here for the last eighteen or so years on the second Monday of the month at 9:00 AM, and you’d think that they would have my medication ready, but it is what it is.

“Mr. Dawson, unfortunately, we do not have your medication on hand at the moment. There is a delay on your refill, and it will arrive at the pharmacy next Monday.”

“What? I *need* this medication. What do you mean it's delayed?”

“I understand, but it seems that your new care provider dated your next refill to next Monday, September 16^(th), 1991.”  

“New care provider? What happened to Dr. Carrey?”

Dr. Carrey was the doctor that I had known for the last fifteen or so years. Despite having little in common with me in hobbies and the like, she was somebody whom I trusted and could rely on to listen to my complaints and gripes. She was patient, caring, and made me feel at ease. She was older than me by about two decades, and she seemed like a second mother to me. She was among the few medical folks that I trusted, and now she was gone. 

“Dr. Carrey was recently transferred to a VA facility in Chicago, but it appears that Dr. Harris is your new provider.”

“Dr. Who? I don’t know who the hell that is, but you need to understand that I NEED this medication or I’m going to lose my mind. Dr. Carrey just up and left without saying a word?”

“We understand, it seems Dr. Carrey didn’t page you about this, and I apologize for the miscommunication. Do you want me to leave a message for Dr. Harris about this matter? He should be in his office in Davenport sometime in the afternoon on Wednesday.”

“Wednesday? Is he on vacation? tell him to prioritize my meds and get them here sooner”

“No, sir, Dr. Harris is not local to the area, and primarily works in St. Louis, but he does come to the area once or twice a week, usually Wednesdays and Thursdays. Of course, I’ll page him and let him know about your concern. In the meantime, if you’d like to explore alternative treatment options, I recommend checking into the veteran mental health community home in Davenport, which is open 24/7. It has on-site staff to supervise veterans during mental health emergencies. Would you be interested in this?”

“Hell no, I just want my damn meds”

“I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Dawson, but there is little I can do at the moment. I will inform Dr. Harris about your refill, and the pharmacy will page you with an update as soon as possible.”

Without saying anything else, I walk off. I knew there was little that could be done for me at the moment. I am pissed at the incompetency of the VA, but what would be the point of taking my anger out on Ms. Frederickson? Wednesday was in a couple of days, and I should be able to hold out until then, hopefully. Plus, Ms. Frederickson was a pretty young woman, maybe between twenty-five and thirty years old, with the smoothest chestnut brown hair I've ever seen, and the clearest brown eyes I can think of. Was this the chick Van Morrison sang about? If I didn’t feel like a shitbag most of the time, I would have the confidence to ask her to a movie or a drink somewhere, but she probably has no interest in an older guy like me.

As I leave the pharmacy, there is a slight odor in the air. It isn’t noticeable enough to unease me, but it is just enough for me to distinguish it. It’s a faint smell of rotten eggs, something similar to a dead battery. Maybe the grain mill was burning something in the distance? Nothing too uncommon given the fact that Colton was a dying agricultural town with some operational mills in the middle of bum fuck nowhere eastern Iowa. While some places like Chicago or St. Louis have skyscrapers, the only tallest structures and landmarks here are our mills.

I head home and crack open a few beers, despite Dr. Carrey’s warnings about drinking and taking the pills. I don’t care, and I haven’t experienced anything crazy since I’ve been taking both for damn near twenty years. If this Dr. Harris tries to tell me the same, I wouldn’t pay it any mind, just like I did with Carrey.

I must have drifted off at around 3:00 PM, and I woke up at around 7:00 PM. A four-hour nap is a rarity for me, but I’ll take it.

Although I’m not enough of a nutjob to go to the ‘mental health community’, maybe I should be around good company if I lose my mind here in a couple of days. Jack and his crazy bipolar ass wife Debra should be able to help me ‘cope’ and keep me sane. Ill go to their shithole of a ranch and shoot the shit. Only a 30-minute drive over there anyway. They may need help taking care of the pigs and chickens, and I could make a few bucks too. Jack and I go way back, and I’m sure he’ll let me stay for a few days.

Colton is usually dead around this time of day, as I hit the road at 7:15 PM. The most you’ll see around here at this time is the odd coyote here and there, especially once you hit the outskirt roads among the endless rows of corn.

“Huh?” I say to myself as I see old Walter looking straight up into the empty blue sky, standing as still as a statue alongside the road by his cornfields.

Walter was an older gentleman who served in World War II as a mechanic. He has a bald head as shiny as a mirror and a temper worse than my sister on her period. Also has a nicotine-stained beard like most around here. At least he didn’t get spit on when he returned home from the war.

I pull up next to him and roll down my truck’s window,

“You good, Walt?”

“…..i-”

“What was that?”

“….it’s….her-“

“What?”

“…It’s…here”

“What’s here? Corn and pesticide?”

“…It’s…here”

“Let's get you home, want a ride?”

“IT'S HERE….IT'S HERE….It's HERE!” he screams as he continues to look up to the sky with a smile stretching across his face, and saliva dripping wildly from the corners of his mouth.

“Alright then, I get it, I'll see you around, Walt.”

I roll up the window and skid out of there. As I pulled out, I could still hear him screaming the same thing over and over. He is standing there, still as a statue and screaming, as I look in the rear view mirror before I hook a right towards Jack’s ranch. Maybe he was having a demented episode? I don’t know, but I didn’t want to stay around to find out. He found his way out there, and I’m sure he’ll find his way back home. He always carries his .45 when he’s out and about in town, and I don’t want to be at the end of that barrel.

As I pull into Jack’s crappy rock ridden dirt driveway, the sun starts to go down over the plains, that faint rotten egg smell remains, distinguished from the earthy scent of a ranch.
