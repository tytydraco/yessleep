As I was woken by the loud noise I heard, I got up to find out what us was. Realizing my mother wasn't home there was a note on her door telling me she would be back by from the store by 12:32, it was 11:49. Knowing that my mom wasn't home I was hesitant to find that noise. But I still did I went down stairs and found my garage door open thinking that my mom left it open. Going back upstairs I texted my mom asking her what time she left to go to the store, then she texted me back saying never went to the store she went to my cousins house. As I was reading that text I heard a faint noise from behind me. Turning around as quick as possible I found that nothing was there I was scared, I ran to my room and locked the door.

 After playing so some games for while I got hungry and went back downstairs despite I was scared, playing call of duty helped my calm down a bit. I went I got some food, but then realized that my garage door was open again though it was only open enough for a small animal to get through like a cat it still startled me. I closed it again Turning around to see what I thought was a person but was just a shadow from my coat rack. I went back upstairs and ate my food.

 then after a while the time turned to 12:27 I text my mom asking her what time she would come back she said by 1am. Then I asked her why she put a note on her door saying she would be back by 12:32. She responded saying she didn't. As I read that text it was 12:30 I heard walking downstairs, so I hid under my bed, scared out of my mind I heard the footsteps come up the stairs. It was 12:31 I heard my dad's voice telling me it was ok to come out he had food for me I came out from under my bed and was about to open the door then I remembered my dad had left to see his sister in the hospital 2 days prior, he said it would be at least 4 days before he came back. Realizing it wasn't him talking I was about to run back to get under my bed, but as I was running the time hit 12:32. Authors note this is my first time on reddit so I have no clue if this is good or not if it is please tell me and if it's not give me clues on what would have made it better. And if it's good enough I will make more or ill make a part 2 to this and make it the mom's side e of the story after she gets home. üòÅ honestly at this point I'm just trying to make it 500 words I don't
