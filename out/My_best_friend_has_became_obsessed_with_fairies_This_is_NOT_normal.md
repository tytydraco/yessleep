My best friend, Lacie, has became obsessed with those magical creatures told in stories. We were just at the local bookstore when she had picked up a book that seemed to be hidden upon all the other books. I can’t remember what it was called, but the cover showed a beautiful little fairy with dashing red hair and giant green wings. She instantly threw the book in her cart, as we were checking out the cashier gave us this look of fear as she scanned the book and placed it in a bag. it was a thick book, I think it was like 20 chapters or something. She didn’t respond to any of my messages for a week. I grew more worried, so I went to her house to check on her. I knocked at the door. “Lacie?” I called. I knocked again, this time louder. “Lacie?” She cracked the door open to reveal one of her blue eyes. “Oh. It’s just you.” She said. She invited me to come inside. There were flowers almost everywhere. “Uhm Lacie, what’s with the flowers?” I asked. “Nothing.” She replied coldly. I glanced at the book laying on her coffee table. I followed her to the kitchen as she prepared camomile tea. “I thought you only liked sweet tea?” I said, getting slightly concerned. “No. I love camomile!” She told me. “Alright then.” I looked over to the window. For the next few hours we chatted, but she seemed off the whole time. Little did I know this was only stage one. 

She continued to ignore my texts for days, days turned into weeks, weeks turned into a month. By this time Lacie was at stage five. I sat down on my velvet couch, the velvet felt weird. My house felt weird. Everything felt weird without Lacie. We would watch our favorite show for hours at a time, while we munched on popcorn and candy we found at the gas station by my house. I picked up my phone and began to call her. Nobody answered. I called her again. Still, no answer. After four more calls I grabbed my purse in frustration and drove over to Lacie myself. Her house looked like a forest at this point. “Lacie!?” I yelled. She immediately opened the front door. She seemed to have plastic wings from the dollar tree on her back. “Why do you have wings?” I asked. “They grew just last week!” She smiled. I let myself in, and looked around her house. There was still flowers scattered around, but now the walls had vines stretched across them. “Why didn’t you answer my calls?” I asked. She threw her hands up. “PHONES ARE CORRUPTING THE MIND!” She boomed. “Woah, calm down.” I told her. “No! And I will not let you be taken over by a screen too!” She grabbed my purse and threw my phone to the floor. “Lacie! What’s happening to you!?” I barked, picking my phone back up and snatching my purse back. “I can’t believe you would allow yourself to be brainwashed!” Lacie screamed. “I’m leaving!” I roared, shoving my phone back in ny purse and running out the front door. I had hope that Lacie would turn back to normal, only for that to be completely shattered.

I didn’t talk to Lacie for months, until she reached level ninteen. That’s when I became worried of her. As I strolled through the park where we would take long walks, talking about our day. I was almost ready to leave until I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. A woman with long hair ran with no shoes on to the woods. She looked dirty and horrible. Her stench was still there when I left that day. I was deep into thought when I peered over and realized. That was Lacie. I ran after her, losing one of my crocs behind. “LACIE GET OVER HERE!” I yelled, my voiced echoing through the crowded area. I felt a wave of embarrassment as I realized people were staring. Lacie crept toward me, a look of trust in her eyes. Lacie, I don’t know what’s happening to you, but I do not like it.” I said sternly, staring into her eyes. She remained silent. It was like she just couldn’t speak. “Let’s go home, Lacie.” I gave her a small grin. She gave me a chilling look and tackled me to the the ground. Everything else was a blur. The cops showed up and began questioning. They asked me if I noticed anything unusual, or if I knew of anything that could have started this. That’s when I had to speak up.
