Growing up, everyone in our small town knew the superstition: “Never follow the jester.” It was one of those sayings adults chuckled about over beers, a remnant of a bizarre local legend. To a kid, it sounded like a joke. I never thought it could be real. Not until the day I turned eight.

It was my birthday, and my parents decided to take me to a nearby theme park—a special treat. The place was packed with screaming kids and flashing lights. My parents stayed close, watching me like hawks, but eventually, I begged them to let me play one of those carnival games. They relented, keeping me within sight.

That’s when he came. Fibby.

He didn’t seem threatening at first. Just a jester with colorful, mismatched clothes, spinning a colourful ball on his finger. His movements were almost hypnotic, his voice unnaturally cheerful. “Hey there, kiddo!” he chirped. “Do you like parties? Birthday cakes?”

“Yeah!” I grinned, completely unaware of the danger.

Then everything changed.

Before I could blink, Fibby grabbed me. His grip was cold and inhumanly strong. My parents’ faces changed into sheer terror as they looked for me, screaming my name, but Fibby was too fast. He dragged me through the crowd, his laughter echoing in my ears. No one else seemed to notice—or care.

He brought me to a small, dimly lit room. I froze when I saw the other children. They weren’t just dead; they were… destroyed. Torn apart like rag dolls, their faces peeled off, bodies riddled with bite marks and scratches. The air was thick with the stench of blood and decay.

Fibby pushed me into a chair and placed a “birthday cake” in front of me. He started singing, his voice soft but dripping with malice. “Happy birthday to you…”

The cake wasn’t a cake at all. It was a grotesque mound of flesh and organs, arranged to look festive. Blood dripped down the sides like melted icing. I could see a tooth embedded in the “frosting.” My stomach churned, and my limbs felt heavy. That’s when I realized—he’d laced the air with some kind of drug. My eyelids began to droop.

“No,” I whispered, forcing myself to stay awake. Fibby’s wide, featureless grin grew wider, his head tilting unnaturally as if he knew I was struggling.

In a burst of adrenaline, I bolted. I didn’t care where I was going; I just ran. Fibby screeched, his laughter turning into an ear-piercing wail as he chased me. His speed was impossible—one second he was behind me, the next he was beside me, his outstretched fingers brushing against my arm.

It was night when I finally stumbled out of the theme park. My legs were shaking, my chest heaving, but I kept running. The streets were empty, eerily quiet. As I passed houses, I saw them—people standing in their windows, watching me with wide, sinister grins. Every single one of them.

When I reached home, I collapsed into my parents’ arms. They were frantic, asking me where I’d been, what had happened. Through tears, I told them about Fibby, the children, the cake. They hugged me tightly but exchanged worried glances. “It’s just your imagination,” my dad said, trying to reassure me.

But as I looked out the window, I saw him. Fibby, standing in the shadows, his head tilting slightly. He raised a hand and waved.

The next morning, the news was everywhere. A mass murder at the theme park. Three hundred and eighty-two people dead, their bodies mutilated beyond recognition. The park was immediately shut down, condemned. But none of that mattered to me.

Because I know Fibby is still out there, waiting for me. Watching.

Sometimes, late at night, I hear his voice. “Do you like parties?”

I don’t know if I’ll ever escape him. Maybe no one can.
