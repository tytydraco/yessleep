Hello everyone. 

I am apart of a group of monster hunters that date back to some of the earliest times in human history. The “Monstrum Venatorum”. My family was one of the founding families of this group and I have been a monster hunter since I learned how to shoot a rifle. Growing up in the Appalachian Mountains, my parents emphasized the important role our family has undertaken to help keep the “normal” citizens of this world safe. You may be wondering why I emphasized the word “normal”. This is because my family is anything but. None of the families that hunt monsters are. We are all born with “special abilities” that make us able to hunt the monsters we do. For all of us, we have the normal array of enhanced strength, durability, speed, low light vision, and a healing factor. This being said, each member has their own special ability.

 For my mother, a member from a separate family of monster hunters, it is the ability to become invisible. Not only will her physical body disappear, but her scent, her heat, and even the sounds she makes will be undetectable. Very important for hunting the monsters of South America while treading through the jungles.

 For my father, he has the ability to control his bodies gravity. Effectively allowing him to fly. He uses this ability to fly through the far reaches of Russia and parts of Central Asia to hunt his prey. 

For my sister, she has the ability to control elements. Conjuring lightning strikes and fire balls to burn away monsters around Europe. 

Lastly, my twin brother and I are a bit different. Being twins, we each have our own abilities and then share one. I can teleport, usually no farther than 300 meters at a time. My brother, the ability to move at supersonic speeds, exceeding 360 m/s. The ability we share being a keen ability for marksmanship. This involves everything from enhanced eyesight, breath control, and enhanced depth perception. Allowing us, with the right rifle, to hit the eye of a bird from 2500 meters away. 

I am writing this now to educate you all on the dangers that lurk in the dark. The monsters that prey on man. Lastly, to let you know, that someone is looking out for you. My brother and I (code names: Odde and Dante) patrol North America and we always hit our mark. 

Now enough with the background, let me share some stories.

Mission 1: Target: Wendigo 

“I fucking hate the cold” 

I sighed as my brother complained about the cold for what must have been the 4th time that hour. 

“I’m aware Odde, but we have a job to do” 

"Yes yes, I know. Simply reminding myself as to why I don’t hunt with Dad. Russia must be horrible this time of year.” 

“I think he’s almost come to enjoy the cold. Seems unfazed about it whenever we talk to him.” 

“Don’t know how. You would think, with all the abilities we are granted, supernatural body heat would be on the menu.” 

“Why? So you could heat yourself up for a Wendi to eat?” 

He glared at me and then his face betrayed him with a slight smirk. Then a laugh. 

“Could you imagine the joy it would feel knowing I prepared myself nicely just for them. Might even crack a smile.” 

I laughed with him “I don’t think I would even want to see the bastards smile, they might be even uglier that way. Come on though, I want to reach that campsite by sundown. Collect some information from the site of the attack”. 

With that we continued to march through the snow. Deciding to walk instead of teleporting or running to stick together in case of any sudden occurrences. We had crossed into the Providence of Ontario two days prior in the dead of winter and were heading to a campsite in the middle of the Boreal Forest of Ontario. We had gotten a call from a contact in the CSIS about 10 bodies that had been found by hikers in the Boreal Forest. Our contact had sent us photos of the scene and the culprit was clear from the start. The scene showed 10 corpses that had all been picked clean, leaving only clothes, bone, without the marrow, and hair behind. The work of a Wendigo. He sent us the coordinates and we began our journey. 

Now Wendigos are nasty beasts. Stories of these creatures have been around since humans began telling stories. The details on how they come to be and what they look like differ, but one detail is almost always present, their bloodlust. Wendigos crave flesh. They are always hunting for more. Natives say this is due to a curse inflicted on them that makes it so that no matter how much they eat, their hunger will never be satiated. In folk stories and legends regarding Wendigos, stories tell of ways to kill Wendigos. This is usually with fire and brute strength. I would highly recommend against any attempt to combat these ravenous creatures. You want my advice? Avoid hiking in isolated mountains, forest, and hills, especially in colder environments. If you live in cold climates, carry a high caliber rifle with you at all times. Wendigos are durable, but can be dropped with a well placed shot. Lastly, if you hear a voice that sounds like someone yelling for help, run the other direction as fast as possible. They have been known to lure prey in with their ability to communicate. If all else fails, pray. Coming to terms with your god is all there is left to do. 

We arrived at the scene about an hour before sunset, the orange glow of the setting sun showing the grisly scene that awaited us. The campsite, and the surrounding forest, had been closed off with the excuse of heightened bear activity. This being said, there wasn’t much to investigate. The bodies laid where they had died, surrounded in a pool of dried crimson. 10 corpses, 4 males and 6 females, the bones showing signs of scratches, bite marks, and blunt force trauma. Clear signs of a struggle were observed. 

Odde spoke up “They didn’t go easily.” He was holding the hand of one of the female victims “All of her carpals and metacarpal bones are broken, as if she repeatedly hit the Wendi that had attacked her.” 

“I agree” as I picked up a shell casing from a .30-06 Springfield. “They obviously fought back, so why is there no Wendi corpse? 10 people fighting for their lives and they don’t take one to the grave with them?” 

“Bad shots?” Odde looked at me, obviously as puzzled as I was. 

“I don’t think so. You don’t hike out in these parts in Winter without some idea on how to defend yourself.” 

Odde stared at the ground. The snow under the dense canopy had only been a light blanket. “I’m going to dig up some of this snow, get an idea of the Wendi we’re dealing with.” 

Looking at the site of the attack, it was clear the attack was fast and lethal. The fire pit in the middle of the campsite showed that the fire had burned down to nothing but ash, it was not put out by the people here. This meant that the Wendigo that had attacked these people had to be deadly, stealthy, and unnaturally fast. I was still attempting to mentally piece together details of the attack when Odde called me over. 

“Dante, you’re going to want to see this.”

I teleported to Odde’s side to see what he had uncovered. It was tracks, a bunch of deep tracks in the freezing ground. At least 20 sets by my count, circling around the campers. I was stunned. Wendigos hunting in packs? Their bloodlust usually made them incapable of doing anything but killing each other to sate their ever growing lust for flesh. Somehow these Wendigos were able to put that aside and hunt as a pack? It wasn’t anything I had seen before and the idea unsettled me. One wendigo was a headache, a pack of them was a terror. 

Odde, seeing my obviously stunned expression spoke up, “I guess this answers your question about why there are no Wendi corpses. These poor folks didn’t stand a chance.” 

His words brought me back to reality, “Fucking hell. A pack of 20! Running rampant through one of the thickest forest in Canada.” I ran a hand over my face. “I’m gonna call this in, see if our friends have any idea on where these things are holed up.” 

I stepped away and pulled out my satellite phone to call our contact at the CSIS 

“Dante, any information about those campers?” 

I delivered our findings to M, our CSIS contact. 

He took a deep breath before he responded “Fucking 20 of them!” 

“At least, potentially more. These ones are larger than normal Wendi’s too. Looking at their tracks, I’d say 1.5-2x larger at the minimum.” 

“Okay, so what is the plan?” 

“Do you have information about any cavernous networks, abandoned villages, or any other kinds of shelter out here? With their team coordination, numbers, and territory control, I’m starting to think these Wendi’s are smarter than normal. Possibly attempting to set up a larger community to continue to hunt this area.” 

There was a long pause only broken up by the sounds of a keyboard clacking on the other end. “According to a satellite map of the area, there is a cave network around 5km to the west of you. Not a large one, maybe 1km in total length. It’s well hidden too, in the densest part of the forest.” 

“It’s the only lead we have, appreciate the Intel M. Logging out.” 

“Happy hunting Dante.”

After the call I walked back over to Odde who was still examining the Wendigo tracks. “M says that there is a cave network a couple km west. Could be where these things have set up their nest.” 

“So you think they’re smart too huh? Son of a bitch. These things are nasty enough with an empty head. Fuck it, at least we can get out of the snow.” 

I nodded. “Let’s move” 

We began to march west, now knowing we were potentially on their doorstep, we stuck mostly to the trees. Using our enhanced strength and speed to jump from tree to tree. Not only as a way to move more unseen, but also to keep a better eye view of the forest beneath us. Night had fallen by the time we started to see the mouth of the cave. The darkness did not hinder our sight much, but we both knew that if the Wendigos lived in this cave, they were going to start being more active now that the sun had gone down. We positioned ourselves on the tallest tree limbs on the outskirts of the small clearing 

“Odde, I’m gonna teleport into the cave for a quick peek. Can you assemble my rifle while I’m in there?”

 “Already working on it.” 

My brother pulled out 3 segmented pieces of a rifle. A custom piece of equipment designed by my uncle. My uncle never wished to work in the field and instead used his ability of metal manipulation to create custom alloys that he would create into custom equipment. For my brother and I, he would create each of us a custom semi-automatic rifle that could be taken apart and rebuilt in less than a minute. Additionally, he implemented a caliber converter within the rifle. This allowed it to shoot a range of ammunition that ranged from .300 WIN rounds to .50 BMG. This was helpful for not only traveling lighter, and hunting a large variety of monsters, but also for blending into urban environments for other hunts. 

I teleported into the cave and stood completely still, listening to my surroundings. The first thing I noticed was the smell, it was putrid. I combination of rotting flesh, mold, and the iron scent of fresh blood. Secondly, I noticed the small sounds of crying and muffled screams deeper into the cave. I jumped another 50m to a bend in the cave. Peering around the corner, I saw them. All of them. Sickly pale, with long sharp claws still stained red from a recent feast. Hollow, wide jet black eyes and those uncanny gaunt legs that carried them across the main portion of the cave. All of this topped off by large antlers that rose to at least 2ft in height. One was much larger than the others. They were standing in front of the group. He was massive, at least 16ft tall, with bloodstained teeth and claws that dwarfed the others in size. Behind him were 3 people chained to the cave wall with spikes nailing them to the walls. They were gagged and had cuts that riddled their bodies. Wendigos hunting in packs was one thing, but capturing prey and bringing them back to their nest was a completely other matter. One of the captured people looked past the crowd of their ghoulish captors and made eye contact with me. I put my finger to my mouth in a “hushing” motion and mouthed “I’ll come back for you”. I then turned and teleported out of the cave. 

Back onto the limb of the tree Odde handed me my rifle. I looked at Odde, “They have a leader. Big fucker and meaner than the rest. Also, we have another problem.” 

Odde looked at me with a sarcastic expression “It gets worse?” 

“Yeah, they have 3 captive humans in there. We have to try and keep them out of the mess and alive.” 

Odde thought for a second “Alright, then let’s lead them out of the cave. I can set a grenade trap at the front of the cave. The explosion won’t be enough to collapse the entrance, but it will be perfect for taking a few down before we have to fire a shot.” 

Odde always had a knack for traps and explosives. He would often, for long hours, study with our retired grandfather on the best uses for explosives. Doing so for the purpose of whittling down larger groups of monsters. 

I nodded, “I’ll teleport around to find an elk and I’ll bring it back here as bait for your trap. Then, we blow them away.” 

We silently nodded to each other and got to work. It took me no time at all to find an elk sleeping in the forest. I pounced onto it and used my combat knife to cut its legs so it couldn’t run. It immediately started to cry out. I picked it up and teleported back to the cave entrance to drop it only a couple feet from the cave entrance. As soon as the elk hit the ground, activity in the cave began to stir. Odde was already back in the trees when I teleported to our spot. Not a moment too soon either. Not even a minute after I dropped the elk I could see the first wave of Wendi’s. 

“I count 5 of them” Odde stated as he leveled his rifle to his shoulder. “The trap should get around 3 of them. I’ll shoot right, you get left.” 

I responded by lifting my rifle as well and aiming toward the mouth of the cave. Only a second or two later and the Wendigo’s burst through the mouth of the cave and tripped the wire. The explosion took out 3, just as Odde had said. A moment after, the sound of our rifles cracked to life. The .338 win mag rounds easily dropping 2 more Wendi’s before they even knew where to look. We had officially stirred the hornets nest. 10 more Wendi’s charged through the cave and out before the dust had even settled from the grenade. Our rifles continued to sing a symphony of death as within 6 seconds, 10 become 2. They spotted us in the trees seconds before dying and with that disturbing, uncanny ability to speak croaked out 

“The trees! Kill them!” They died directly after the last word escaped their lips. Our magazines rang empty at the same time. 

The last 5 roared through the clearing, the leader staring daggers at us in the night. Then they charged. Faster than I have ever seen a Wendigo move as they hit the trees before either of us could reload. Climbing them by digging their long claws into the bark. In unison we slung our rifles over our shoulders and drew our handguns. Matching magnums, another custom piece from Uncle, loaded with 50 AE. I teleported to the mouth of the cave while Odde bolted down the trunk of the tree, tearing though a Wendigo like it were a traffic cone in front of an 18 wheeler. The leader was unfazed to this as he loaded his giant legs and pounced after me. I hadn’t even turned around before I felt the claws sink into my back, tearing flesh and pinning me to the ground. Through gritted teeth I teleported above the cave while hearing the boom of Odde’s gun taking another Wendigo to the depths of hell. The leader glared at me with something akin to a smile as he licked his claws.

 “Your blood is different from the rest of the mortals I have tasted. I’m sure your flesh will be even sweeter.”

I shot 2 bullets into its chest and hip. The beast roared in pain and rage. It quickly showed us that it was still in fighting form, as in a blur of speed it spun around and swatted a speeding Odde 30 feet away into a rock face. The sound of bone breaking reverberated off the trees. I teleported down to the clearing blasting the heads off of the 2 Wendi’s charging Odde’s body and helped him up. 

“You good?” 

“Yeah, fucker broke a couple of my ribs but I’ll make it.” 

We stood, both staring at the behemoth while he charged us. We shared a look and grinned. Odde spoke quietly “Now?” 

“Now.” 

He then rushed forward in a burst of speed producing an ear shattering blast as he broke the sound barrier and point blank shot the beast in the chest. This opening his thick skin to reveal the bleeding muscle beneath. I lined up my shot and fired. Blasting a hole the size of a football into his chest and stopping his heart. It dropped like a bag of stones onto the forest floor. We walked next to the dead creature, me helping Odde to walk. He had taken a deep cut to his leg in his last mad dash. The wound already starting to mend itself shut.

“What the fuck, I’ve never seen one take so much to kill.” Odde exclaimed. 

“I don’t understand either.” I knelt down to examine the beast. “Odde? What do you make of this mark?” 

He groaned as he crouched next to me. “Is that a tattoo?”

 On the back of the creatures head was a symbol. The symbol showed a beast with 3 heads, one doglike, one snake, and one hawk. I grabbed my phone from my pocket and snapped a picture of it. 

“We’ll look more into it later. Right now, we have some people to help. Can you gather the corpses in a pile and burn them? I’ll help the people inside.” 

Odde nodded at me and began to work. 

I walked back into the cave. The 3 prisoners seemed to have gone unconscious sometime during the fight. Either from blood loss or terror. I grabbed a medical kit from my sling and began removing the prisoners from the chains securing them into the walls. I quickly sterilized their injuries and began sewing them shut. Trying to mitigate any more blood loss while doing so. While tending to the last prisoner, they woke up. It was a women, no older than 25. She looked at me with fear filling her eyes. Upon seeing what I was doing a tear rolled down their cheek. 

“Thank you.” 

“I told you I would be back. We’ll get you home.” 

She didn’t say another word as she seemed to slowly loss consciousness again. I soon finished my task and carried all of them out of the cave and into the clearing. Odde was lighting the fire. Under the rays of orange from the flames, I called M and set up a meeting so he could take them for further care and memory wipes.

 Arriving at the rendezvous site M greeted us warmly. “Well done you two. We can handle it from here.” 

We dropped the prisoners into gurneys that were promptly loaded into a waiting chopper. 

“What are your plans now?” 

I shook M’s hand “We have reports of some beast making messes in the swamps of Louisiana. After a quick stop back home we’re southward bound.” 

“Sounds a good a plan as any. If we ever are in need of your services again, we’ll call.” 

Odde, already starting his walk to the nearest city, yelled “And we’ll answer.”
