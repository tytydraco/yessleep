The first video arrived at 3:33 AM.

"1 New Message: From Yourself"

In it, I was sitting in a coffee shop I'd never been to, wearing clothes I didn't own, laughing with people I'd never met. The timestamp read "Yesterday, 2:15 PM" – exactly when I'd been in my quarterly budget meeting at work.

I checked my call history. No outgoing messages at 3:33 AM.
Checked my sent folder. Nothing.
Checked the video metadata. File created: Never.

The second video came the next night. Same time. Same sender.

This time I was on a beach at sunset, teaching a dog I don't have to fetch. The timestamp matched my dentist appointment from that day. My dentist confirmed I'd been in his chair at that exact time, getting a cavity filled.

The videos kept coming. Each night. Always at 3:33 AM. Always showing me living a life I had no memory of:

- Playing piano at a bar (I don't play piano)
- Rock climbing (I'm terrified of heights)
- Speaking fluent Mandarin to an elderly couple (I barely know English)

Each timestamp perfectly aligned with moments I could account for elsewhere. Moments with witnesses, paperwork, security footage.

I started documenting everything. Recording every minute of my days. Installing cameras in my apartment. Collecting alibis and timestamps and proof of where I was.

But the other me – the one in the videos – had proof too.

Restaurant receipts started showing up in my email. Photos tagged on social media. Business cards with my name and face but different credentials. Concert tickets in my wallet that I never bought.

Then came the letter:

"Dear Time Thief,

You should stop documenting 'your' life so obsessively. It's getting harder to edit you out of mine.

Yes, mine. Because this is my life you're living in parallel. My time you're stealing, one second at a time.

Did you really think you were the original?

Check your earliest memory. Really check it. When exactly does your life begin? What's the first thing you remember?

Let me guess: Six years ago. The hospital. Waking up after the 'accident' with no memories before that moment.

That was no accident. That was your creation point. When you split off from me like a temporal tumor, started living your own version of my life in parallel.

Every moment you experience, you're stealing from me. Every breath you take should have been mine. You're a temporal parasite, feeding off my unlived possibilities.

But I found you. And I've been documenting everything you've stolen.

The videos aren't showing you a life you don't remember.

They're showing you the life you're preventing me from living.

Every time you make a choice, the life I would have lived splinters off, becomes a video delivered at 3:33 AM. A record of what you stole from me.

Want proof? Check your bedroom wall. Behind the mirror. You know, the one you've always felt weird about but never knew why.

Go ahead. I'll wait.

- The Real You"

I ran to my bedroom. Tore down the mirror I'd never hung but had always been there.

Behind it was a hole. Inside: hundreds of hard drives. Each labeled with a date. Each containing thousands of hours of footage.

Of me. Living lives I don't remember.

But they weren't just videos.

They were windows.

Through each one, I could see myself living another life. All happening simultaneously. All real. All authentic.

And in each one, I was staring back through the screen.

Watching me.

Documenting me.

Each version convinced they were the original. Each one thinking the others were the thieves.

As I write this, I can see them. Hundreds of me, all writing the same words. All making the same discovery. All coming to the same horrifying realization:

None of us is the original.

We're all splinters.

Fragments.

Each of us stealing time from an original that no longer exists. Each convinced we're the real version, the others are parasites.

But here's the true horror:

This message you're reading?

You didn't choose to read it.

You're stealing that choice from another you. One who chose not to read it. One who's living a better life right now, untouched by this knowledge.

Check your phone.

It's 3:33 AM.

And you have 1 new message.

From yourself.

Want to see what choice you just stole from yourself by reading this?

Want to see the life you could be living instead?

Just press play.

But remember:

The you that's watching...

Isn't the only you that's watching back.

We're all thieves here.

All living on stolen time.

And it's 3:33 AM somewhere, always.

Check your phone.

See?
