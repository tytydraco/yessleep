A few years back at oh dark thirty, probably closer to 2am than midnight, I had myself a pretty bad case of the midnight munchies.

This is nothing unusual, it was a warm night in august, and at the time I still smoked, so I drove the three minutes down the road to my convenience store of choice. About two thirds of the way to the store there's a bridge that rolls over some railroad tracks.

I saw a man walking on the sidewalk of that bridge, and for a moment wondered if there wasn't something funny in whatever it was that was in the weed I'd smoked earlier. There was a man who could've been anywhere between late thirties to his sixties walking.

It was hard to tell his age because he was in full clown regalia, even toting a bouquet of balloons. facepaint, huge shoes, the works.

At this point I am driving about as fast as the man is walking, because what the actual fuck. Is this real?

He turns to me and gives me a big smile. It was a smile that haunts me to this day. Would send any self respecting dental professional into hysterics. Bright yellow and jagged teeth, just... even a meth addict would recommend a toothbrush.

And he says to me in a voice that sounds like he's been smoking 3 packs a day since he was in the womb he says, "Hey pal, can I get a ride?" and throws up the hitchhiking thumb.

NOPE! NOPENOPENOPENOPE! NOOOOOPE!

I floored it and did my first ever burn out, my little Honda civic seemed spurred on by my terror. In the distance I could hear him laughing. Gravelly and genuinely amused.

Was also the first time I'd managed to drift in that car, because at the end of the bridge the convenience store was around the corner.

I didn't feel safe in the car. Uh uh. I shot out of the car like I had an ejector seat, didn't even close my car door or bother locking it. Just ran inside the store, pale, shaking and sweating, presumably looking like I'd just seen something out of my worst nightmares.

That'd be on account of I just did, actually.

The clerk's like, "Uh, hey buddy, you okay?"

I give a little bit of a manic laugh, "Absofuckinglutely not. There's a dude walking this way in full clown regalia. Sounds like death warmed over."

Clerk hears what I said, looks at me, and astutely comes to the conclusion that there are no hidden cameras, I am NOT playing. That sets him off too, "Oh FUCK no. Why did it have to be a clown."

He grabs a cordless phone and hits a number on speed dial, then zips over to the store's only entrance and locks that thing tight. Clerk is talking to the police over the phone, describing what I'd seen.

You'd think they'd laugh and tell me or him to lay off the fun drugs.

They most certainly did not. Clerk was told to lock the place down, make sure I stayed there. Help was on the way.

Three squad cars came to the little store, in MINUTES, sirens BLARING, 2am be damned! Several police officers descended on the store, armed to the teeth. Not just pistols, oh no. Assault rifles and shotguns. They were taking this seriously. Actually checked around the building before they asked the clerk to open up.

Then the police officers talked to me. Asked me to describe what I'd seen.

And I could hear more sirens. And then more. I didn't think my little town had this many officers this late at night. When I mused on that out loud the officer who was interviewing me gave me a funny look and then an odd laugh, "Son, every single police officer in the county just got their asses rolled out of bed. You'd best not be pulling our leg here."

I solemnly assured him I wasn't. On account of I actually wasn't, as well as a sense of 'I will say whatever I need to say to make the man holding an assault rifle happy'.

Two squad cars actually stayed for almost an hour, keeping watch while the other police cars searched.

After an hour or so, one of the cops inside with us got a call over the radio and said I could go home.

I asked if they'd found the clown.

Cop gave me a look and said, "Would it make you feel any better if I said we did?"
