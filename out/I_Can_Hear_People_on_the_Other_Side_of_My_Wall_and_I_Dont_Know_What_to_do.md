My name is Nathan and there are people moving around on the other side of my bedroom wall and I don't know what to do. 



It started a couple weeks ago when I was laying in my bed trying to sleep when I heard something move around. It was small and barely audible, maybe a mouse or a cat or something. All the houses in my development have really thin walls so it wasn't uncommon to hear things moving around outside, especially at night. It continued for a couple minutes and I didn't think much of it. Went to sleep soon after it stopped. I didn't hear anything for a day or two after that.



The next time I heard something was at bedtime again. It was late and by the time I got my bed out (My room is tiny so I save on space with a folding mat I sleep on) I was ready to pass out. My eyes were heavy and consciousness was failing me. Just before I was out I heard it for a second time. More shuffling. Again, I didn't really think too much of it but I've always been a little paranoid so I had to wait for it to stop before my body would let me sleep. 



This time was different. After a couple minutes of shuffling I heard a distinct *thump thump thump thump*. It sounded just like footsteps would coming from another room with hardwood flooring. This roused me because it came from the same wall as the last noise the day before. An external wall. There's nothing past that wall except for 30 feet of grass before you hit the neighbor's shed and another 20 until the neighbor's house. 



“What the he-” I muttered under my breath. Immediately after the words left my mouth the noise stopped. I sat there staring at the wall with my heart pounding. A few minutes passed, which felt like an eternity to my poor heart, and nothing happened. No more noises. 



After my heart settled down I felt a wave of embarrassment wash over me. How could there be footsteps in a room that didn't exist? It was late and I was exhausted. I must've been imagining things. Like when you're drifting asleep and imagine falling and jolt awake. Hell, it could've even been someone banging on something in another house. It still bothered me though. It sounded so close.



It still bothered me the next morning and I couldn't quite shake that feeling so before I went to work I went around the house to look over the area on the other side of my bedroom. You'll never believe what I found… Nothing. Absolutely nothing. After a couple minutes of looking and some weird glances from dog walkers on the sidewalk out front, I couldn't help but laugh a little.



“You're losing it Nate” I scolded myself with an embarrassed smile as I jumped in my car and drove to work.



A few boring days later while I was waiting for a delivery to take (I'm a pizza delivery guy), I recalled the odd events in the week earlier. Yet again a sense of cringe hit me and I couldn't do anything but laugh at myself. I texted my girlfriend, JJ, and told her about it. She laughed with me and teased me about it. She told me I should even write a spooky story about it. I have no idea what direction to even take something like that.



“Maybe the footsteps are some sorta people from a parallel universe and the barrier between our universe and theirs is wearing thin in that spot. Or maybe you could make it like a psychosis thing or ghosts or–” I hate stopping her when she's excited but I have no idea how to even write or format stories. Truth be told, I'm not even interested in writing. I'm just keeping this journal so I don't go completely stir crazy in my own head. 



It's been two weeks since the first time I “heard” the noise and JJ keeps bugging me to write a short story about them. She says it would be good for me to take up writing instead of just going to work and gaming when I get home. 



“You need to get out of your shell! I know you don't like people so I'm not gonna drag you out of the house but you need to do something else to exercise that brain of yours”. She's always looking out for me. Wanting me to “be the best version of myself” I can be. It's annoying but she's got a point and I can't help but want to do better for her.



“Tomorrow I'll try writing something but don't be disappointed when it doesn't turn out any good” I texted her. I would've paid good money to see how thrilled she was but I couldn't help but smile when her flood of excited texts came streaming in on my phone. I wasn't nearly as excited as she was but that was a problem for tomorrow. I still have my games tonight.



I got my bed out and put on some soft white noise, a recommendation from JJ. I was thinking about the story I had reluctantly agreed to write. Where do I start? Where do I take it? I could make it a ghost story, I've always liked those. But I live in a new development and to my knowledge this wasn't some sorta “ancient Indian burial ground”. I guess I didn't need to make it about *my* house in particular and ghost stories are getting kinda stale. I don't know. That's tomorrow's dilemma. I should get some sleep.



I laid there, eyes sealed shut, trying to stop thinking about the story and its possibilities and just sleep. Just as I turned over and got comfortable I heard it again. A booming *THUD* followed by two distinct sets of footsteps. I was already up, crouched low and eyes locked on the bare wall. This was real. I wasn't crazy. The footsteps sounded like they were about 15 feet away and they were getting *closer.* They were approaching the wall.



I tried to stand and run but my legs were jelly. *10 feet* *away*. In a desperate panic I grabbed the knife off my dinner plate and clutched it as tight as a rock-climber gripping the cliffside in a thunderstorm. *5 feet*. My whole body was shaking, my knuckles were white as marble around the hilt of the knife. *A couple feet*. The only thing between them and I was a paper thin wall that the builders cut corners on.



Silence. There was no sound except for my heart exploding in my ears. Minutes, hours, days could've passed in that silence and I wouldn't have known. Finally, with a shock to my senses there was a deafening scratching noise. In a brief second of terror I thought they were scratching *through* the wall until the noise started getting quieter, smaller. They were dragging something *away* from the wall, like two kids dragging the dining table across the room. After a couple minutes of this the noises disappeared into the silent night and I was left there staring at the wall until the sun came up.



*There are people making noises on the other side of my wall and I don't know what to do.*
