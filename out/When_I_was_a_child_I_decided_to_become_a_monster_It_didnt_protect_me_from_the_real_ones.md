This story is technically the second in a series, but there’s no need to read the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1279omg/my_grandfather_gave_me_a_letter_six_months_before/) before this one. I’d actually recommend reading this one first.

The existence of a child is a peculiar one. They live in a sandbox of imagination, where mistakes are rarely punished with worse than a time out. 

However, every child eventually encounters a point where the consequences of their actions follow them beyond the safety of the sandbox. I first encountered that point when I was eight years old, and the consequences haven’t stopped chasing me to this day. 

Let me explain the circumstances which persuaded me to break into my neighbor’s house.

I didn’t have much family growing up. My parents died shortly after they had me, and my grandparents on my father’s side took me in. My grandmother died when I was little, so I was raised mostly by my grandfather. 

After my grandmother passed, my grandfather became overprotective, and would never let me be unsupervised outside of school. If I went to the park, he would go with me. If I went to a friend’s house, he’d make sure their parents knew not to leave me on my own. He had padlocks on all the entrances to our house, and he kept them locked whenever we were there alone, as he had a tendency to fall asleep in his reclining chair and didn’t want me running off. I was upset that he didn’t trust me, but we loved each other, and we were happy enough. 

School was a different story. Lots of the kids had known each other since before kindergarten, and my grandfather’s supervision policy meant I hadn’t made many friends at that point. I wasn’t very social, which made it hard for me to break into a friend group, and I was different from other kids in a lot of ways, which made it easy to pick on me. I was an orphan, and beyond that I was pretty weird; I liked to talk to worms, which meant I was “wormgirl” until we eventually moved. Even my teachers called me that sometimes. They never liked me much; I was messy, I didn’t follow directions, and it was a nightmare to try to get me to focus on a task. 

Being a loner gave me lots of time to read. I loved reading and writing; not the type you do for class, but adventure, mystery, and ghost stories. I loved Nancy Drew, and accumulated a whole collection of the yellow hardcover books. I liked the Hardy Boys too, but not as much. There was a book that involved a secret passageway of some sort, and that got me searching all over the house for hidden doorways. 

Surprisingly, I actually found something. My house had dormers, with windows facing into the attic, and it wasn’t obvious unless you looked closely, but these windows opened outwards. I discovered that not only did the windows open up, but my grandpa hadn’t thought to lock them. They led onto the roof, and from there I could climb down a trellis to the ground. I started occasionally sneaking out for a few minutes while my grandfather was asleep, and when that worked out, I started going out for longer. He never noticed; even if I was out for hours, he always seemed to be sleeping when I got back.

I was very proud of my new discovery, and noticed that all of the other houses on our block had the same type of dormers. One day, after reading a book about a group of kids performing a heist to steal a baseball card, I decided to see if I could get into other houses, too.

That night, after my grandfather told me my bedtime story and tucked me in, I waited to hear him go downstairs, then tiptoed over to my closet. I pulled on a hoodie and traded my pajama bottoms for athletic sweatpants. I crept back into bed, pulled up the covers, and watched the digital clock on my bedside table until it read 12:00. 

I slid out of bed and snuck over to my door, then had a sudden idea. I grabbed a big stuffed rhino from my floor and put him under my covers, so that it would look like I was in bed. Feeling very pleased with myself, I snuck up to the attic, out the window, and down to the street. Their living room light was on in the house to the right, so that wouldn’t work. I turned to the left, and scanned the windows of our neighbor Jenny Scott’s house. The four windows facing me were all dark. Plus, Jenny lived alone. Yes, this would be perfect. 

I pulled myself over the short 3-foot white picket fence that divided our front yards, stepped along the paving-stone path to the backyard gate, and pulled on the string that controlled the latch. Like most gate latches, this one was really sticky. I tried to be gentle at first, not wanting to be noisy, but when that didn’t work I gave it a good yank, and it came open with a clack. It wasn’t very loud, but to me it sounded like a gunshot. I crouched down, expecting to see a house light turn on and my neighbor come running out any second. After about twenty seconds, I seemed to be in the clear, so I pushed through the gate to the backyard.

Jenny’s backyard was just an empty grass field, with a maple tree growing near the side of the house. She didn’t have a trellis, but the tree had nice thick branches placed relatively close together, so, ducking down to try and stay out of the view of the back windows, I made my way over to the tree. I pulled myself from branch to branch until I was even with the bottom of the roof, gingerly stretched my right leg over to rest upon the shingles, and slowly shifted my weight until I was comfortable bringing my left leg up and over as well. With my palms against the roof, I shimmied over to the front of the house, then braced one hand on the top of the dormer while I carefully pried at the window with my other. It swung open silently.

I swung my feet over the window frame and pulled myself into the attic. At this point, I wasn’t really sure what to do. I hadn’t planned much further than getting into the house, but it seemed a shame to just quit there

The attic wasn’t crowded, but held a couple of blue Rubbermaid bins and an old couch. No better course of action occurred to me, so I knelt down and popped the lid off one of the boxes. It held a couple old binders and a stack of papers. The other boxes turned out to be similar. I’d been hoping to uncover some sort of exciting secret or valuable item, so I was a little disappointed. I flopped down onto the couch.

I thought about what would happen if Jenny came up into the attic and saw that her boxes had been opened up. Would she know that I had done it? Maybe she’d think a ghost did it. That would be pretty cool, I imagined. If I came back every night and moved things around, she’d have to think it was a ghost; no normal person would break into a house just for that. I liked the idea of being a ghost; it was the kind of thing that would make for a great spooky story or Nancy Drew mystery. My legs started bouncing up and down: at that moment, I believed this was the greatest idea I’d ever had. 

I got up, tiptoed over to the attic hatch and pushed it open, then peeked my head in through the opening. The hatch was in the upstairs hallway, which connected the stairs and all the bedrooms. This was the same as in my house. The master bedroom door was closed and the light was off, so I looked to be in the clear. I slid the attic ladder down slowly, and the carpet flooring muffled the thud as it touched down. 

I descended the ladder and considered my next move. I started by opening the doors on my left, revealing two empty moonlit rooms: an exercise room and a guest bedroom. I frowned; just opening doors wasn’t very spooky. I decided I’d have better luck in the kitchen, and made my way down the carpeted stairs, the slight pat-pat of my feet barely breaking the quiet. 

I froze for a second when I reached the bottom of the staircase. There was less moonlight down here, and I could only make out the silhouettes of the furniture and appliances. The shadows and shapes blended in and out of focus as my eyes constantly readjusted. The thought that something could be lurking in the shadows made my knees shake and the hair on the back of my neck bristle. I wasn’t even in my own house, so I wouldn’t be able to run and get my grandpa if something were to happen.

I shook out my hands and took a big huff, then glared into the darkness. I didn’t need to be afraid. I was the phantom now. If there were monsters down here, I just had to be one of them. 

I crept through the living room, and suddenly felt a sharp pain in my thigh; I’d bumped into a coffee table that was too low to the ground to be illuminated. I stifled a yelp. Once the pain subsided, I crouched down and waved my hand around the table surface. I made contact with a tv remote: that would be perfect. I carefully made my way over to the kitchen, moving my legs slowly in case there were any more obstacles sitting low to the ground, and put the remote on the stovetop. I glanced around quickly, and my eyes landed on the silhouette of a kettle. I lifted it slowly and took it back to the living room, leaving it on the couch. That seemed like a good enough start, so I tiptoed my way back up the stairs, into the attic (pulling the ladder up and closing the hatch behind me, of course) and out the window. 

I made my way back to the roof of my house. As I stepped through the window frame, I hazarded a glance backwards. A car was moving down the street, casting two long headlight beams. I immediately dove into the attic and pressed myself against the floor, too afraid to even pull the window closed behind me.

It wasn’t the light of the headlights that scared me, but the pair of pinpricks that reflected it in the trees at the end of the street.  

By the next morning, my fright the previous night started to seem silly. What had I even been scared of? Throughout the course of the day, my mind raced, brainstorming different ways I could make the house seem haunted. Some were small: swap the knives and forks in the cutlery tray. Others were big: set the couch on fire. I didn’t listen to a word my teacher said the whole day. I could barely focus on Language Arts at the best of times, so it actually wasn’t much different from normal.

That night, I snuck back up to the attic. As I stepped out into the cool night air, I glanced towards the treeline, pausing for a good five seconds in the window frame. The trees swayed slightly in the wind, and no unfamiliar shadow or silhouette jumped out at me, so I chided myself for being such a wimp and made my way over to Jenny’s house. This time, I brought a trusty spy kit, which was my flashlight, some tape, a couple pencils, scissors, and a measuring tape, stashed in my lunchbox.

I want to be clear that I had nothing personal against Jenny. She seemed friendly enough, and I can’t recall her ever being mean to me. She was just *there,* and it was fun. As a kid with no friends, hated by my teachers and mistrusted by my grandfather, I loved feeling that *I* was the one in control, and someone else was at *my* mercy. Sometimes kids get really fixated on an idea, and they don’t properly comprehend the consequences until it’s too late. It’s not that they’re incapable of understanding, it just doesn’t “click” until the damage is already done. Other kids rode their skateboards off the roof, I gaslit my neighbor into thinking she was haunted or insane. Thinking about the pain I caused keeps me up at night to this day.

From then on, my recollection of the nights kind of blends together. I would get up at midnight, sneak over to the house next door, and do my thing: move coats around, rearrange shoes, steal grocery lists, take magnets off the fridge and put them back the next day, et cetera. After a week, there were new locks on the windows, although the dormer window was untouched. After that, I noticed new locks and an alarm system for the doors. I was worried about the possibility of security cameras, laser beams, and booby traps, so I started being extra careful to take a look around from the attic before dropping the ladder.

One night, as I was creeping down the stairs as usual, I looked towards the living room to see a dark, unfamiliar silhouette. Above the armchair, there was an ovaloid shadow. My leg froze mid-step, and the air caught in my chest. For ten seconds, I couldn’t even breathe. The shadow swayed slightly. I slowly backed my raised leg towards the stair behind me, and set my trembling foot on the carpet. 

I was carrying my lunchbox in my left hand. I unzipped it as quietly as I could, using the skin on my fingers to ease it open one tooth at a time, keeping my eyes locked on the shape in front of me. I got it open a little ways, and stuck my right hand in, grasping around briefly before making contact with my flashlight. I retracted it slowly and pointed it downstairs. I debated whether I should turn it on. I was afraid of alerting whatever was down there, but I was more afraid of not knowing what it was. I braced myself to flee, then activated my flashlight. 

My light illuminated Jenny, sleeping in the armchair. I hit the flashlight button again as fast as I could. The room plummeted back into darkness. Jenny’s shadow didn’t move. I was safe. I heaved a sigh, letting out all the tension that had been piling up in my chest and shoulders. Not wanting to tempt fate again, I confined my activities to the upstairs that evening. On my way back to my house, I mused that Jenny had probably been trying to catch me, and that I was pretty lucky that she fell asleep before I got there. I caught her downstairs once more after that, and again she was already sleeping.

Another night, as I climbed the attic ladder to return home, I got a feeling that something was different - something was off. I pulled myself up quickly, and turned around. A chill bolted down my spine as I realized what I was looking at. The window was open. I had closed it on my way in.

My legs stood frozen, as if the implications of this window, swaying in the wind, wouldn’t become real until I moved. With every passing moment, the terror in my chest grew. Mustering all the courage I had, I forced myself into action. 

I crouched down and slid the ladder up with both hands, pulling as fast as I could. I stared down into the opening, terrified that I would see someone or something appear below, and desperately wishing the ladder would slide faster. The ladder finally cleared the hatch, and I slammed it shut. I bolted through the attic and swung myself out so quickly that I nearly pitched off the roof, then grabbed the window and slammed it closed, not daring to look back into the attic, convinced something would be looking back. I scrambled down the tree and sprinted to my house, stealing glances behind me the whole way. 

I didn’t go back the next night, or the night after that. By the third, time and sleep had eased my fear from a boil to a low simmer, and the idea that someone else had been in the house with me started feeling less rational. I decided that I had probably just left the window slightly ajar on my way in, letting the wind blow it open.

I resumed my visits on the fourth night. From then on, I always put a piece of tape across the window and the frame while I was in the house. I figured that this would keep the window from blowing open, and let me know if someone else came through after me. This seemed to work, as I never again found the window open on my way out. 

As time went on, I often saw weird little things on my visits to the house. Stick figure drawings on the walls, which were gone the next day. Strange smells, like skunk mixed with rotting fruit, and others I couldn’t place. Polaroid pictures of different rooms in the house scattered on the table. It seemed Jenny was starting to break down. I started having second thoughts, worried about what I was doing to her, but my doubts were always forgotten by the morning, and inertia carried me on. 

One night, there were dishes in the sink, and a coffee mug on the table. The next night, they were all still there. For the first time, I dared to open Jenny’s bedroom door. There was a desk in the opposite corner, with a square window above it. A boxy white computer monitor sat atop the desk. Clothes poked out of a wooden wardrobe beside the doorway. The bed, a queen size with an elk pattern quilt, made neatly, was empty. 

I stopped going to the house after that, this time for good. 

The news reported it as a disappearance. Most outlets noted that Jenny Scott had reported strange activity in her house to the police in the preceding two months; some said it was a kidnapping, others suggested that she had suffered a nervous break and fled. The front door was unlocked, the alarm was disarmed, and her car remained in the driveway. There were no signs of a struggle, and the only thing out of place was the dishes. The house was surrounded in police tape for days; officers came in and out carrying various items in baggies, and police dogs were taken around the neighborhood, but no explanation was ever published. My grandfather was taken away a couple of times for questioning. A nice police officer even spent some time asking me about what I knew, but they weren’t accusatory and I said as little as possible. My grandfather questioned me more insistently, asking if I’d seen anything strange around the neighborhood or in the trees (he specifically mentioned the trees), but again, I played innocent. Eventually, the whole thing simmered down, and life, for everyone else, went back to normal.

For me, though, it seemed the affair wouldn’t just go away quietly. Whatever happened to Jenny, I was sure my actions played a part. The guilt crept up on me; the guilt, and something else. 

In the weeks following Jenny’s disappearance, I started noticing little things that were amiss in my house. One day, a shirt would be in my closet when I thought I left it on the floor. Another day, a pencil crayon would be lying on my desk in a color that I thought I never took out of the box, or the magnets on the fridge would be in disarray even though I sorted them the day before. Something about what I had done in Jenny’s house, likely combined with guilt over what happened to her, tricked my brain into feeling paranoid that the same thing was happening to me.

At least, that’s what I would be inclined to think, if it weren’t for a note I found lying on my desk one day, written with my red colored pencil:

*I like this game, Abby*
