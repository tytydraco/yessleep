Heya! Ash I'm really trying hard to share this story because I'm having nightmares thinking ab it, pls help.   
 Ok so When my Father died, I was 15, me and my mother moved in with my stepdad 3 months of my fathers death. The house was fine, Orange color walls, cute white tiles, everything was normal, and it was nighttime when we arrived so we just went in quick, took our bags and sat down on the couch and rested after a long trip. After an hour, my step-father went out to buy some food and my mother went to the bedroom to lay down and scroll through Facebook, I was on the couch listening to music.   
After a While my mother called me, I came to the bedroom, and shaked.. She told me if my step-father went home because she saw someone went pass the bedroom (The apartment was small, the living room was square And it has only one hallway, bathroom at the left, bedroom at the left as well, and at the end of the hallway was the kitchen) I said to my mom, no, he did not came back yet, who did you saw?   I was hiding my fear as I was extremely scared of ghosts and I 100% believed them. My mother stood up and he hurriedly ran to the living room and sat down at the couch together with my brother (It wasn't my brother who went pass the hallway, he was always at my side) We were configuring things on what is happening, We calmed down and we just waited for my step-father to come back.   
While we were waiting, The lights started to flicker, from time to time As time went late, the lights Flickered intensely, The feeling in me was weird, I had anger, sadness and fear. So in conclusion, in order not to get too scared, we believed it was my dead father saying that he was there. So when we had that mindset, everything went normal. And my step-father came back and we told the whole thing, his reaction? Nothing much. But i know there was something he does not want to tell me. 

  
  17 days after that time, we now believe that It was not My father.. We took a picture after I was freshly Showered, while the picture behind us was a Smart TV. We took a couple of shots, and one terrified us THE MOST. The TV has an additional shadow, instead of two, which is me and my mother, there were 3.. I thought it was my brother again since the shadow had very long straight black hair (like it was facing the camera as well and her hair was reflecting the tv) but my brother was busy playing games on the sofa.. I called my stepfather, and we wanted him to explain what was happening..  So, he explained. That apartment was burned accidentally by one punk boy, The building burned, killing a whole family in that part of the apartment we rented.  
 Baby, Sister, Brother, Mother, Father, grandfather, and who knows are now Dead due to the fire incident. We were shocked to hear the story, and now we know the recent owner of this apartment does not want to let us live here anymore. But not in a safe way, they were protecting their home, not us.   So during the days of horror,  we lived there for 1 year, overcoming our fear. My mother felt so sick living there, and my step-father became more of an angst father, while, I was neglected by the ghost, as I thought that I had done a couple of bad sins before and they might consider me as the devil of the fam? Who knows, they won't get close to me, not like my siblings and parents did.   
But one time, I was sleeping on my own, the mini fan on my bed fell, and i was so angry I started shouting about who the fck fell my fan in a very hot evening, (My parents weren't home)   Yet, I was still scared, my face in the mirror was different, some were looking at me.. The lights are wired, it feels like I'm in a dream, The objects are always misplaced, The tv gives me traumas, I was sick on every occasion too, just like my mom, my brother.. He looks weird, he keeps getting pale and dull just like a ghost, and his attitude is getting abit violent..   I started using salt as protection, hoping it would work, so I put salt on the bed while I was sleeping, but in the morning, it was in the trash..  
 I swear it was on my hands, nobody was there, WTF?   The orange house, I won't be coming back there again. The lights,my dreams, my brother, my mother, my step-father, the objects, they are all getting scary, it's a heavy feeling and I would rather die to think about it. But now, I'm still scared of ghosts, it's just that, I'm back in my original home, and the ghost I know here now is my Loving Father. So, thanks to that orange house, I'm 50% not scared and 50% scared.    
  I have Pictures, but I deleted them due to fear as that memory is scary and it feels like those ghosts will follow me if I keep those pics.     
Sorry for the wrong grammar! Cant type straight due to this story
