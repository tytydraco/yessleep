He had convinced himself that he was possessed by the spirit of a noble samurai, a tortured soul intent on revenge. Who exactly was the subject of his ire was unclear, but it was evident to me that he was willing to accept substitutes and express his villainy to anyone unlucky enough to cross his path. To be precise, his outbursts were for the most part harmless, a flurry of slaps across the shoulders accompanied by a lecture on the virtues of loyalty.

“I have been betrayed! He must perform seppuku!” he would often yell.

I admit that was a term foreign to me. I had never heard of seppuku.

*The ritualistic suicide of a disgraced samurai warrior, usually resulting in disembowelment.*

I remember seeing such an event on television, a fictional event of course, but I thought it was as simple as a stab to the stomach and then a benevolent beheading from an empathetic compatriot. Pulling your own intestines out though- to me that was overkill.

Jordan wasn’t Japanese, much less, anything that could be called a warrior. He was a red-headed white man, homeless, disheveled, and emaciated. I had never seen a skinnier man in all my life. He was a skeleton with a thin sheet of flesh. If there were internal organs, they were frail and shriveled.

He was mentally disturbed, often mentioning that he had been on various adventures. He had been everything from a Navy Seal to a Knights Templar. There were various fantasies, some more in-depth than others, but they were temporary and easily shrugged off, that is, until he became a samurai. Once the samurai was born, it never died.

As I mentioned before, Jordan was harmless. He would assault you- if you could call it assault- if you walked too close to his corner, but for the most part, he never approached. He was not a threat, until one day he showed up on the corner holding a katana in his hands. On this day he was particularly boisterous, cussing and making more threats than usual, so much so that even my wife, usually glued to her phone watching videos, took notice.  

“Holy Shit. Jordan has a sword.”

“You are harboring a fugitive, a coward!” I heard him yell.

I dashed over to the window. Sure enough, there he was in a rigid stance, legs shoulder-width apart, back straight, stiff-armed, holding the sword out in front of him with both hands.

“Where the hell did he get a sword?” I inquired.

“Should we call the police?”

“Yeah, for his sake, but first let me try and convince him to get rid of it or the police might just shoot his crazy ass.”

I approached Jordan cautiously. The sword reflected the sun’s light, circular rainbows bouncing across the edge. I’m no expert in katanas, but this didn’t look like a cheap knock-off. It was a beautiful work of art. The curve was slight, but majestic. The hilt gold, wrapped with exquisite black fabric.

“That’s a beautiful sword Jordan.”

“Muramasa,” he said, never turning to acknowledge my presence.

“Mura…..,” I tried to repeat.

“Muramasa, the demon sword.”

“You know, someone has probably called the police. Might not be a good idea to have a sword in your hands. And you might want to stop yelling obscenities.”

“It’s obscene, that he still lives. So long has he lived.”

“Who Jordan? Did someone do you wrong? We can tell the police, but you got to get rid of that sword. I’ll take it and hold it for you. Yeah?”

Jordan turned his head and looked in my direction but refused to look me in the face. Before I could react, he shuffled and slashed me across the wrist with the tip of the sword. I looked down at my arm to see how bad I was wounded. It was a deep gash, down to the bone. I felt no pain but panicked at the sight of exposed muscle and bone. I feared for my safety and thought that Jordan was intent on killing me, but as I looked up to ascertain what my assailant was going to do next, I noticed he had fled the scene.

Sirens howled in the distance. The bitter heat enveloped me, and the wind blew sharp against my skin. My entire body was sensitive to every aspect of the environment. My wound was numb, but the rest of my body ached from the weakest of sense impressions. Everything was loud, bright, and painful. As absurd as it sounds, I felt the wound on my arm move. The gash moved up my arm and split open wider, the skin unfolding, exposing the true human, the human unwrapped, the cellular inner workings of raw, biological machinery. Tendons and muscles moved in unison with my fingers. Blood rhythmically pumped through my veins. In the midst of my arm appeared a small dark orb. It gyrated and spun, buried itself deep in the tissue and disappeared. The wound closed in on itself and my arm healed as if nothing had ever happened.

The police came and went. The neighbors asked me if I was hurt. To their surprise, I had not been wounded. Some had sworn he had cut my arm off.

“I saw the whole thing from my bedroom,” said Mrs. Williams. “He cut your arm off.”

“Yeah, it was shocking, but here you are,” replied David, “with no sign of harm. I guess this is what they mean by mass hysteria.”

Whatever they saw or whatever I felt, it was all nought, gone, never existed. Where was that red-headed bastard? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced he had drugged me, maybe even the entire neighborhood- a slight of hand, not mass delusion, but mass drug-induced hallucination.

It was important to get to bed early that night, for I had devised a plan to surprise Jordan and steal his sword. I knew the general vicinity where the homeless encampment was, if not the exact location. That damned sword- I couldn’t get it out of my head. If I could get that sword, he would stop this nonsense and go back to one of his more innocuous fantasies. What is a samurai without his sword?

As I dozed off, I heard the noise of horses, and the clanging of metal. I had a vivid dream or was it a vision. A samurai warrior, fitted in black and red, with a dragon-faced helmet, and four horns protruding from the side and the front of the helmet. It was a fierce looking creature, hacking and mauling his way towards his enemy, the white warrior. The field was clear, the two ready to fight, but before the noble battle could begin, a flag bearer, threw down his red banner, unsheathed his sword and thrust it into the back of his master, the Dragon Samurai. The flag bearer looked towards me, and then looked downward in shame. He had a noticeable scar from his right cheek, through his lips, and across his chin.

I could smell, feel, and sense beyond those normal attributes usually associated with dreaming, but more than anything I felt the anger of betrayal. I caught a glimpse of a shadow in the corner of my room. A silhouette of a samurai warrior standing perfectly still. It then moved into the moonlight. The warrior only had half his face, the other side only a skull, with bits and pieces of flesh dangling about. He raised his sword high in the air and shoved into my abdomen.

“Honey, wake up. Jordan’s back.”

I woke up with an insatiable hunger in my belly. The mention of his name angered me. This time I was not going down there unprepared. I grabbed a crowbar and made my way down to the patch of trees behind the corner where Jordan was standing. I would sneak up behind him and give him a good knock across the collar bone. I’d put him in plenty of pain without endangering his life.

As I started to sneak out of the shadows, I saw Mrs. Williams approach the corner accompanied by a small Asian man, withered and old. His skin was liver-spotted and wrinkled; hair, beard and mustache were thin and white. He walked with his chest parallel to the ground, his back stuck in a bent-over position. When he got to Jordan, he looked past him and straight at me. He had a noticeable scar from his right cheek, through his lips, and across his chin.

“Finally, you choose honor!” Jordan proclaimed.

The old man fell to his knees. Mrs. Williams handed him a sword, not near as majestic as Jordan’s.  The old man unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off. He then, without any hesitation, took the sword and dragged it across his belly. He grimaced and cried out in pain but remained steadfast in his mission. He tried to slide his left hand into the wound but realized he hadn’t cut deep enough. Blood was now everywhere, pooling below on the sidewalk, and draining down the slope into the sewer. The old man repeated the cut but made sure to apply more pressure, in a more deliberate move, not quick, but effective. The sword disappeared into his flesh, sinking deep below the skin. A gush of blood sprayed into the air as he finished the cut. This time he successfully inserted his hand into his gut and began pulling out his intestines. Jordan moved behind the old man, and raised his sword high above his head, his eyes glowing red. He hesitated.

“Grant him mercy! Please!” Mrs. Williams pleaded, with tears streaming down her cheeks. The old man kept pulling and unraveling his entrails out onto the street.

“Let him suffer for a time!” It seemed forever before Jordan finally ended the man’s suffering. With a quick downward motion, the man’s head fell off his neck and rolled into the curb, his hand still clutched to his intestines. The body slumped forward, but never touched the street, the crookedness of his back creating an odd counter force against gravity. The body looked to be in levitation, blood pouring out his neck like an overturned chalice.

Mrs. Williams was panting with panic, with quick shallow breaths. She clutched her chest and fell dead to the pavement.

Jordan picked up the head, turned and faced where I was hiding. He bent down to his knees and pulled the sword out in front of him.

“It’s your sword now.” He then shoved the sword in his gut and through his back. He slumped over and laid on his shoulder. I didn’t dare approach, not wanting to leave any evidence that I had been a witness. Jordan’s death wasn’t immediate. He lay there suffering, wailing about his misfortune in life, and wondering most of all where his mother was. It was an ignoble death. The spirit of the samurai had left him. He proclaimed he was unworthy of the sword.   

The scene was chaotic. I wanted to help somehow but my footprints would surely be discovered; most of the street and sidewalk was covered in blood. It was best to leave it where it was, in Jordan’s gut. Yet, I fear that someday the sword will find me. The samurai has chosen.
