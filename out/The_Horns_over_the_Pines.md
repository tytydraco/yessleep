I rented the cabin because I’d honestly been tired of working my ass off at my job, and needed a cheap retreat to nature that wouldn’t cause much of a dent to my wallet. The listing had said it was quiet and secluded, and the images showed a tranquil forest nestled in the hills. Obviously, I caught the latest booking. 

The cabin sits in a bowl of hills thick with pine trees and fauna. During the day, it feels normal enough. The stove works. The floorboards creaks, but not enough to annoy you. The owner was kind enough to leave a TV with an old PS4 still hooked up to it, with a few games on the shelf next to it. There’s even a guest book on the table with smiley faces and notes about hiking trails.

The first night, I heard something roar.

My first conclusion was a bear. But it didn’t take me long to know it wasn’t. I had grown up around bears, this wasn’t it. This sound had a shape to it, ripping through the air with a sheer ferocity that seemed to shake the floorboards. It rose to a crescendo,  dipped, then finally ended in a low, deep reverberation that rolled through the trees, causing the leaves to audibly sway.

I looked out the window.

Between the pines on the far hill, something shifted. At first I thought it was two trees, standing taller than the others. Then one of them moved independently.

That’s when I saw the horns.

They were too tall. That’s the only way I can describe it. Antlers branch. Goat horns curl. These were long, smooth arcs that rose straight up, appearing like black silhouettes against the starry night. Below them I saw the rough figure of a deer-like face, obscured by the distance and dark.

It took me a long time to fall asleep again, and the next morning I wonder if it was a dream. I went about my day, exploring the woods, albeit now with a certain degree of caution, reading books by the fireplace, and playing games till twelve o’ clock. The next night, my theory was disproven when I heard the guttural roars yet again.

They weren’t constant. They came in intervals, spaced just far enough apart that my body never relaxed enough to fall intothe comforting embrace of sleep. Instead, I found myself holding my breath, wide awake, waiting for the next roar.

I shut off all the lights and didn’t dare to look out the windows for a long, long time. I gathered up the courage to look outside yet again only when the roars stopped. That nigh, the horned beast seemed to be moving. I could see the thing moving aimlessly along the treeline, until I saw it turn it heads in the direction of the cabin. My heart raced as it crawled up my neck. It almost stopped beating when I thought I noticed it lock eyes with me. I closed the curtains then and there, turning my back to the walls and burying my face in my knees, wishing that I  could calm the hell down.

I packed my stuff in the car before sunset today. I threw things in the back with haste and determination. I’d planned to spend the whole week here, so it took a while for me to pack up all of my fishing gear, hiking stuff, clothes, etcetera, even when racing against the clock. I kept telling myself I’d leave at first light. I didn’t want to drive those roads at night, not with that damn fog already thickening, let alone the fact that my hands were still shaking from the pure adrenaline and booze coursing through my blood vessels.

That was the mistake. I assumed distance mattered. I assumed whatever it was stayed in the hills, stayed out there. It wouldn’t needlessly pass it’s territory, right? I delusioned myself with this mantra.

The roars started earlier tonight. Not from the hills this time. No. It was from the treeline just beyond the clearing.

I didn’t dare to go outside. I didn’t look out the windows. I shut the curtains, turned off every light, and sat on the edge of the bed with my keys in my hand like they could protect me.

The sound neared.

It was loud. Louder than anything I’d ever heard. My ear was threatening to burst. It was closer in a way that made my skin crawl, the sense of impending doom overtaking me. Heavy footfall and the crunching of leaves added to that. It was strong. The ground shook with each step it took. Something scraped against the cabin’s exterior, sharp claws scratching loudly against the wood. 


Even through the curtains, I could see the shadows. Long, changing silhouettes covered the small bedroom. Through the gap in the curtains, I could see a bit. Oh god. I could see it’s abdomen, hidden by the shadows. The windows were more than six feet above the ground. It was tall.

I realized then that it wasn’t going away. Somehow, it knows I'm here. And I think its hungry. 

The roars stopped. In their place came a low sound that vibrated through the floorboards. It was a low, guttural growl.

I finally slid under the bed when the porch creaked. Something heavy leaned against the front of the cabin. The wood groaned, a deep, exhausted sound. I pressed my phone to my chest, every muscle locked, listening as the footsteps moved slowly across the porch.

Then the front door exploded inward, My heart threatening to leap out of my chest. I began to sob, as silently as I could.

If you see this, heed my warning. Don’t stay any longer in the woods if you see horns over the trees. It won’t stay there for long. It’s probably already seen you. After all, it doesn’t need to rush. It’s hunting you. 

Oh god, I can see it’s feet from beneath the bed.
