It takes me a minute to pull myself together, the sort of time I can’t afford to waste. My watch blinks up at me. Nineteen minutes before Jonah and I become statistics in a police report, another dead duo in a never-ending string of cannibal suicides. 

I wonder what the kid’s face tastes like. 

I wonder how Zipperjaw is going to convince me to eat it. 

Jonah gulps. “Why are you looking at me like that, dude?”

He’s staring at me like a dog about to become roadkill. Shaking. Paranoid. He’s bundled up in his blankets like he thinks they might save him, and it makes me want to hurl. The sheer naivety of it. The childishness. 

It’s revolting.

I watch a tear slide down his cheek and something inside me stirs. My father would’ve beaten me for showing that kind of weakness. He’d have given me a lesson only fists can teach: that victims attract predators, and crying signals you're easy prey. 

But I’m not my father.

So instead I grit my teeth. Force my fist to relax. I look back at the clipboard, flip the page hard enough it tears, then scribble the time in the margin: 11:42 PM.

“You can drop the act,” he mutters.

I glance up, grunt. “What act?” 

He wipes at his eyes. “This tough guy thing. We both know it's bullshit.”

His tone. I hate it. The way he’s talking is like I’m no longer the most dangerous thing in this room, like he isn’t my hostage. 

“I was sitting right here when Zipperjaw punched a hole through the door,” he continues. “You were shaking. Terrified. Looked like you’d seen a ghost.”

I clench my jaw hard enough I hear my tooth crack. Next come my knuckles.

“There you go again,” he says, gesturing to my fists. “Getting angry like it’s going to fix anything.”

It could fix his attitude. I’m willing to bet my life on it. 

“Why can’t you just admit you’re afraid?” he asks. “Why can’t you accept that you’re just as terrified as anybody else would be?”

Because I'm not anybody else.

Because fear is the only difference between predators and prey. 

Because—

A cough erupts from my throat. 

It turns my sleeve the color of over-ripe strawberries, sends a parade of pain shooting through my chest. It feels like dying.

“The only thing I'm afraid of is how nasty your face is gonna taste going down. Now shut it and answer my questions.”

But Jonah just shakes his head. Gives me the sort of look reserved for old men who spend their days beating their chests and breathing fire from their sagging house porch. One part pity. Two parts disdain. 

“Got a problem?” I ask. 

“Just wondering if you even know how to be honest.” 

I level a finger at him. “Watch it.”

“Why?” 

“Because I’m done with this psychoanalysis crap. You don't know me. Stay in your goddamn lane.”

He rolls his eyes.

The son of a bitch, good-for-nothing brat actually *rolls his eyes*. 

“No shit I don’t know you. You haven’t told me a damn thing, not even your name. You’re a walking question mark, dude. A black suit wearing a man. You probably don't even know yourself.”

That's it. I've had it.

I lurch up from my seat, hand cocked with every intention of smacking some sense into the kid, but then my damn lungs get in the way again. Another cough. 

Then a few more. 

By the time I’m finished, I’m slouched over in my chair, a winding trail of blood running down my palm. 

Jonah shakes his head. “I get the sense you’d probably kill yourself if it wasn't for the leukemia. This is all you live for, isn’t it? Revenge. Violence. Without Zipperjaw, you’d be forced to recognize how empty you are inside. How you’re nothing but—”

I bolt to my feet, snatch the kid by the front of his hospital gown. My arm snaps back. 

He recoils. Flinches. 

It’s a reaction I recognize, the exact reaction I’d have when my old man would give me some fatherly advice, one fist at a time. 

And suddenly my anger deflates. 

My arm drops.

And I crumple back into my seat, head in my hands, chest full of shame.

“Jesus,” Jonah murmurs. “You really are broken, aren’t you?”

“Stop it,” I tell him. 

“Why? Hate seeing yourself? Don’t blame you. I’d hate it too.”

I look up, meet his eyes and this time I can’t keep the pleading from my voice. “Please,” I tell him. “Just… stop.”

We stare at each other for a while. Then he exhales, looks away like I’m a lost cause not even worth his time. “Fine,” he says. “No more questions. Not like you’d have answers for 'em’ anyway.”

My first thought is to teach him some respect. My second is we really don't have the time. My third is that maybe the kid is more right than I feel comfortable admitting, and that's a rabbit hole I can't risk. Not right now. 

“Tell you what,” I say. “You give me your story, and if we make out of this, I’ll give you mine.”

He gnaws at his lip, considering the terms. “Deal,” he says.

“Great.” My pen taps against the clipboard. “You found Zipperjaw on your doorstep. Go from there.”

He shifts.

And there it goes, all that bravado washed away like dust in the rain. “It stepped inside,” he croaks. “Didn't turn around. Didn't speak. Just walked in, backwards, swaying like a drunk on those tiny legs. It smelled awful, man. Like rot. Like corpses cooking in the sun.”

Jonah rubs his neck, uncomfortable.

“It had scissors, too. Purple safeties. Like the kind little kids use in school. They were…” His expression crumples, disturbed. “They were lodged in its skull, man.”

My grip on the pen tightens, turning my writing sloppy, jagged.

My sister had a pair of purple scissors. Addy used to use them for her dolls, snipping holes for their felt mouths, cutting yarn for their hair. She’d sit cross-legged on the living-room carpet, tongue poking from the corner of her mouth as she stitched up her army of silent friends. Humming. Always humming. 

It drove my father mad. It made him—

“It ripped them outta its head,” Jonah continues, pantomiming the action with disgust. “Black bile spilled down its neck. It brought the scissors to my shoulder and snipped a piece of my sleeve, then stuffed the fabric back into that wound, almost like it was a fucking pocket or something.”

He shivers.

The way his eyes crinkle, the way his whole body seems to fold in on itself tells me from here on out we’re entering uncharted territory. That these are memories he blocked out. Buried.

“Its face,” I press. “Describe it to me.”

“It… It didn’t have one,” he croaks. “Didn’t have a nose. Didn’t have ears. Didn’t even have skin, man.”

“It didn’t have skin?” 

“Not exactly. It was more like fabric. Brown. Coarse. Looked like it was made of burlap, and sewed along its jaw was that zipper, wrenched up in a manic, hungry smile. But the worst part was its eyes.”

My heart starts to gallop. “Why?”

“They weren’t real,” he sputters. “Just stuck on. Plastic. Like those cheap googly-eyes kids glue onto crafts.”

Adelaide used those in her dolls, didn’t she? Yes. Those patchwork abominations stuffed with scraps and peppered with mismatched buttons. 

Horror skitters up my spine.

This isn’t the same monster I’ve been chasing for the last fifty years.  No. Zipperjaw's changed now—evolved. It chose my father’s voice just minutes ago. Now it showed itself to Jonah dressed like one of my sister’s dolls. That didn't sound like mindless evil. It sounded calculated. Deliberate. 

It suggests a terrifying possibility: that Jonah didn’t botch his suicide. That his survival was by design. That perhaps the only reason he’s even sitting here was to lure me to this backwater town, to corner me in this empty hospital wing. To give me to Zipperjaw. 

My pulse quickens. 

“You okay?” Jonah asks. “You look all pale, man.”

Gotta get back on track. Can't let him see the hopelessness in my eyes, in my voice. Can't let him know I'm starting to believe we're already dead. 

“The face,” I rasp, loosening the tie around my neck so I can breathe. “You were saying it showed you its face.”

He studies me a few moments longer, almost like he sees straight through me. But then he gives a slow nod. “Yeah. Then it opened its mouth.”

He reaches to his lips, motions like he’s unfastening a zipper. Mimics the sound. 

*Click. Click. Click.* 

“The monster’s smile came undone. Its jaw fell to the floor, gaping like an open sack, and that’s when I could finally hear them.”

“Hear who?”

“The victims,” he says. “Whispering from inside its throat. I recognized them. Or what was left of them anyway.” He starts to stammer, words tripping over themselves as grief and panic snatch his vocal chords. “Their faces hung like ornaments inside that monster's gullet, dude. No eyes. Empty mouths. But somehow I could hear them still. Every last one.”

Beep.Beep.

Beep.Beep.

His heart monitor starts to sing. Starts to blare like an air-raid siren. The kid starts hyperventilating, his repressed memories bleeding out like scabs he's ripping free. My therapist would call what I’m doing to the kid traumatizing. I call it necessary. 

“The faces,” I hiss. “Think back. What did they say to you?”

And here's where it gets pathetic, where Jonah starts to squirm in his sheets, where he grips at his head like it might keep the memories from escaping, only it can’t. Nothing can. 

“No…” he whimpers. “No. No. No…”

The way he’s blubbering tells me he doesn't like what he's remembering. Not one bit. And that's promising. It means I might actually have something I can use—a clue to stop this nightmare. So I stand up, grab the kid by his shoulders. Squeeze. Give him my best impression of human empathy. “Jonah. It's okay,” I tell him. “You can talk to me.”

When he looks up at me I expect to see more tears, more sniveling childishness but instead I see sunken eyes, downturned lips, a complexion waxy enough to be a ghost. 

I see a mirror. It turns my stomach. 

“It's my mother,” he says. “They told me about my mother.”

“What about her?”

His expression twists. “That cancer didn't kill her.” 

The next question is obvious enough I don’t need to ask it. His lips part, an explanation on them, only he never manages to force it through his lips. Instead he smacks his head. Once. Twice. It’s the kind of ritual I’m familiar with, the sort that’s supposed to force bad memories back into their graves. 

“Jonah—”

“No,” he spits. “It wasn’t true. The voices—they were liars, man. It was Zipperjaw manipulating me. That's all.” He wraps his arms around his legs, hugs them tight to his chest. Starts to rock back and forth like he wants to believe it. 

I want to corner him on the deflection, but it’s 11:46PM. No time to force confessions. Not while I can hear the choking gurgle of that monster beyond the doorway, not while I can hear the slap of its bare feet pacing. 

So I let Jonah take the wheel. I pray he drives us where we need to go.

“I ran,” he whispers. “It lied to me and I ran to the kitchen. To find a knife. To find something to defend myself with. Something to kill it for what it did to my dad, for what it told me about my mom. Only it snapped down onto all fours again, leapt onto the wall, started galloping after me like an animal. Its jaw was hanging loose, swinging while it hummed that awful tune…”

Jonah scrunches up his face, trying to remember, then he starts to hum. 

My pen pauses against the clipboard. My blood goes cold.

The song… It belonged to my mother before she passed. Before it became Adelaide’s. Addy would hum it as she built those patchwork dolls. As our father drank himself to sleep on the couch. She’d hum it to forget the nightmare we both existed in, the squalor and the abuse. It helped her remember how to smile. 

And Zipperjaw stole it from her.

The same way it stole everything else. 

Jonah’s voice breaks. “A shadow passed over me as I reached the knives. I looked up and saw that patchwork dress. That tangled hair. Zipperjaw dropped down on all fours. Limbs clicking, moving all wrong. It started creeping closer, but all I could see were those googly eyes, that zipper-mouth dragging across the floor while it continued humming. I snatched a knife. It didn’t react. Just kept coming, all those torn-off faces whispering to me inside its open throat. Lies. So many lies. I wanted them to stop lying to me, to go away so I stabbed. Kept stabbing. Only I couldn’t… I couldn’t…”

Jonah gets small. His shoulders start quaking, almost like he wants to cry but can’t, like the memories are stealing his grief, hollowing him out and leaving behind nothing but rage. 

“You couldn’t what, kid?”

“I couldn’t make them to stop lying…” He takes a shuddering breath, looks me in the eyes, and it’s like I’m watching a childhood burn to ashes in real time. “They kept whispering. Kept telling me a story I’d been running from my whole life. Ever since I was little. They told me… my father deserved to die.”

I lean forward, my heart pounding. “Why did he deserve to die, Jonah?”

A smile flickers on his lips. “Because it wasn’t cancer that murdered my mother. It was him. He wanted to cash in on her life insurance, and when she started recovering from the cancer… He poisoned her to seal the deal.” He giggles. “He saw it as providing for us. Can you believe that?”

Jesus. 

Outside, I hear a low hum. It’s broken. Mangled. Like it’s spilling from a hundred different mouths. It’s making my breath quicken, reminding me of Addy before the horror took her. Before Zipperjaw made her do something unforgivable. 

I clench my jaw, bury the memory before it gets a chance to rise up. 

“Think, kid. This is Zipperjaw. It probably *was* lying to you.”

But Jonah shakes his head, smiling more broadly. “Nope,” he says with unnerving, confident cheer. “That’s the thing. It didn’t just tell me the truth, it *showed* it to me. Ripped those purple scissors out of its head and handed them right to me.” 

He leans forward, eyes wide and empty and drops his voice to a whisper. “Know what I did with them?” he asks.

I swallow hard.

“I walked over and cut off my father’s mask.” He cups his mouth, stifling another giggle. “Cut it away snip by snip, and all the while he kept lying to me. Saying he loved me. That I needed to run…” He snarls. “As if the monster hadn’t been living in the house all along.”

Now I’m the one squirming. I’m the one shifting in my seat, horrified by what I’ve dredged out of this kid’s psyche. Meanwhile, that guttural, inhuman humming is growing louder outside. A whole chorus of the damned taunting me with my sister’s song…

“It sounds awful,” Jonah whispers. “I get it, man. I do. It isn’t that I wanted to eat my dad’s face but…”

And there it is again, that flickering, maniac smile carving its way across his lips. 

“As soon as I started chewing, the lies started unravelling. I could see it, man. All of it. Inside my mind like a vision. The truth. I finally saw my dad for who he was, and I hated him more with every bite.” 

Is this what Zipperjaw did?

Did it show its victims a good reason to murder their loved ones?

Did it simply… tell them the truth?

I wince, memories crashing against my mind. I’m remembering Adelaide. The day Zipperjaw made her take her own life. The day it made her murder our father: jamming those purple scissors inches deep into his skull while he slept. 

I try to rise, but I’m stumbling over my own feet.

No.

Dammit.

These memories, I buried them for a reason. They shouldn’t be surfacing. Not now. Not ever. Please God…

**BANG. BANG.** 

The door shudders. Jonah sits bolt upright in his blankets. No longer afraid. Grinning ear to ear, like a cultist ready to meet his master. 

11:58 PM.

Shit. Where did the time go?

**BANG. BANG.** 

The hospital shakes. It isn’t making it any easier to stay on my feet. 

Still, if I’m gonna die, then I’ve got a burning question that I want answered. 

“You cut your throat,” I say, forcing the words through my teeth as my world spins. “If you wanted to murder your father, then why kill yourself? You should’ve been happy. Satisfied.”

“I was,” Jonah admits, heading tilting sideways. “Until Zipperjaw left. Then I felt strangely guilty. Like I’d done something wrong.”

**BANG.** 

Another knock. I lose my feet and crash to the floor, ears ringing. 

So the monster’s presence affects its victims. Soothes them. It’s convincing them they’re carrying out some kind of benevolent act by ‘unmasking’ the person they love… only for reality to come crashing back in once it leaves. 

Explains why Jonah is acting like a bloody sycophant. Zipperjaw’s been right outside this whole time. 

“It’ll be okay,” he says reassuringly. “Let the voices tell you what you need to hear.”

Doesn’t he get it? He’s my VIP. He’s the one that’s going to get the face-eating treatment. He knows this, yet he’s still singing Zipperjaw’s praises. I stagger against the wall, claw myself back to my feet. Apparently this monster is more powerful than I realized. Probably should’ve brought back-up. Would’ve too, that is if the Order hadn’t fired me years ago. 

Obsessed, they called me.

Deranged.

Even when they knew my past—what that monster had done to me. To Adelaide.

*BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!* 

My watch. It's blinking up at me with the same four numbers. 00:00. 

Midnight.

**BANG!**

The door explodes. It whistles across the room, crashing into the wall beside Jonah. The kid doesn’t even flinch. Just keeps smiling. The way he looks is like he’s barely containing the urge to clap. 

I inch backward, heart hitting my ribs as a shambling figure ducks through the doorway. It creaks like old timber. Sways on legs torn from a child.

“You…” I sputter.

It turns toward me, burlap face shrouded by shadow, but I can see the glint of a zipper. The plastic sheen of stuck-on, dancing eyes. It tilts its head. Inquisitive. Then there's a crack of bones, and the monster drops onto all fours.

Snarls.

And charges right for me.
