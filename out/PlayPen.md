I think I need help. My birthday was a couple of days ago but yesterday a box arrived. I found it tucked under the hedge beside my front door, it seems rotten. The cardboard is damp, green mould seeping up from the corners. I almost didn't bring it inside. But that awful smell of old wet cardboard is now filling my living room as it sags on my coffee table. The tape holding it is peeling but strongly squeezing the walls together, attempting to maintain its box like shape and failing miserably.

A crude attempt of my address was scribbled into the side, the name of my street misspelt. The contrast of this on my name was laughable, Claire was written immaculately each stroke of the marker that made up my name, deliberate and clean. There is no return address, or who it is actually from. The only other writing of note is some scribbles on one of the mould infested depressing looking corners. “M.I.S.E.Y” there are other letters but I can't make them out at all. Just trying to manipulate the corner is making the box squelch and ooze.

I don't really want to open it, but with the damp stale musty smell now fully engulfing my living room I feel like I have to. Even if its just to get the box into the bin.

That sucked. I lifted the box off my table, and seemingly taking a liking to the cold wooden surface, the bottom stayed while the sides tore apart. I jolted upright as the weight shifted, the noise of plastic bouncing off my floor and table reverberated off my walls. I have cleaned it all up, the box is gone, the coffee table is wiped. The items that had fallen out and scattered over my floor are old VHS tapes? That's it really, nothing special there isn't even the friendly paper titles glued to the front to greet me. Just scratched numbers jaggedly scaring the sides.

The tapes had scattered all over my floor. I have gathered them up and placed them on top of one another, the scratched numbers facing me, 1 to 5. They just look like any other tapes I have seen before which to be honest is very little. I don’t even know where to find a VHS player, I think maybe my grandma might have one? Under the circumstances I'm not even sure I want to know what's on them. 

It's been a few days now. I talked to my grandma, our conversation was weird. I told her everything and how weird it was but all she really said was “a gift, a lovely gift, be thankful to those around you and what they do for us.” She has always acted a little odd, always rambling about things. I don't even think she can grasp how strange this all is.. She then spouted about the tapes she received in the past from friends and so on and how wonderful they are for sharing. 

I have to admit walking through town with a VHS player wedged between my armpit and a plastic bag with clattering old VHS tapes was an oddity in town. I would look at whomever had them too but the way people stared and looked away quickly once I caught their eye that unnerved me.

For some context I live on a rock, a tiny island off the coast of ireland. The roads and towns that make up our population are dominated by farmers, fisherman, and labourers. A good description of it would be that there is a field, next to a field, next to another field, that's next to the field with wheat in it. You can walk into a pub and ask anyone “Hey How's old John from St Portpatrick doing these days.” And 5 out of 8 would answer. 

So currently I'm sitting here trying to set this stupid VHS player up, I doubt this thing takes a HDMI cable, I guess I'm lucky that my TV sucks ass. After some fiddling and smacking the VHS player I got it on, I'm not going to lie. I almost screamed when the sudden bright static light flashed on followed by screaming piercing unintelligible audio. Looking into the now quiet TV, Titanic crackling and fluttering past the screen, my eyes drift over to the tapes.

TAPE 1

I don't know what to say, I watched the tape, then again, and again and again. I might have watched it over ten times. Every time it finished I carefully took the tape out, used a pen and wound it back up. The end of my pen is already getting scratches from it. The tape is just of me?

I will try my best to describe it but I still don't really know how to process it myself. It begins with a simple shot of the fields behind my old family house. There is a messy table, colourful paper plates and cups scattered from end to end. Half eaten cake and hotdogs pancaked on and off plates, some squished into the ground. A large balloon in the shape of a 6 tied to the middle of the table. 

The camera pans across the floor following trails of kids' playful destruction. I see my mothers dress poke at the bottom of the frame before it cuts to me, My hands over my eyes sit at a now clean table. A cake placed in front of me. “PlayPen” appears in big colourful letters as the camera slowly pans forward towards me. Candles blown out, ending on my happy face, my big blue eyes reflecting pure joy.

When the TV first cut to black. Reflecting only myself back, my tired, beaten and fragile eyes  replacing the ones captured on the tape. I cried. I did watch it more to see myself smile, to just capture that small glimpse of my mother again. Only after a few more times did I catch the woman behind the tree.

It's been a pain to find the exact moment, it occurs just before the cut off. The camera moves quickly downwards. I can’t pause it at the right moment. I have to try to press the pause button on the tape player and there is a delay..There is definitely a woman there. Curly ginger hair, with two pigtails stuck up in arches. Eyes blurry and wide, her lips bent into an unnatural smile not helped by the messy clown makeup that wiped away her real identity.

I feel so unsettled I don’t even remember that day. I've sat and tried to remember but I just can't, I was only young to be fair, but nothing? I feel like I would have definitely remembered that clown. I'm gonna ask around a little and go to bed. Maybe I'm just overreacting.
