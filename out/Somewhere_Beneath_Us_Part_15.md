My mind swirled with the dark water that carried us deep into the unknown. Thoughts and memories of Daniel clawed their way to the surface while rational panic held them under. He was gone, but right now, the others weren't, and we were currently barreling down a concrete flight of steps and being violently tossed around in the process. I focused on keeping myself balanced in the water, but it was useless. The currents dragged me down against the steps like a wet rag against a washboard, then slammed me into the walls at every turn. I struggled between surfacing to find Ethan and Bea ahead of me, but my eyes stung from the dirty, frothy murk, and my thoughts were about as steady as the crashing rapids.

Dan was gone.

After what felt like an eternity of being thrashed about, I felt myself go into a freefall before breaking the surface of a pool. The rushing water was muffled by the unmoving lake. I stayed still for a moment, not only because of the aching in my body but because I didn't know what else to do. Surface or remain under, the outcome was all the same. We were in over our heads, and it was my fault. At least if I drowned down here, I wouldn't be around to see any more of my friends die.

'Swim up.' I snapped at myself. 'Daniel just died for you. You're not going to throw that away.'

I obeyed and broke the surface, taking in a deep breath of air. I had forgotten how good the feeling was. Around me, a subway station lit with flickering lights was rapidly filling with water. The whole area was already halfway submerged, and ahead I could see Bea and Ethan supporting each other as they crawled out of the water onto a set of steps. Strained and tired, I began to paddle my way over as well. When I reached the stairs, Ethan turned and gave me two looks. One was of relief that I was okay. The other was a realization of what he had seen behind the thin sheet of ice. Slowly, he folded into himself and leaned against the wall before sliding to the floor and burying his face in his knees. I felt like doing the same. I attempted to speak, but no matter how hard I tried to conjure up words of reassurance, none would come out.

Bea circumvented this problem with denial.

"Are you guys okay?" She said, "Where's Dan? He was right behind you, right?" She asked the questions before we even had the chance to answer the first one. Hopping up, she sloshed her way back down into the water, hardly noticing that it was up to her waist. She fixed her eyes on the maintenance door above the tracks that water was currently gushing from and said nothing else.

I forced myself to stand and stepped into the pool with her, "Bea…."

"We have to wait for Dan." She said plainly.

"Bea, Dan's not-" the rest of the sentence hooked into my throat like nettle being torn from a thicket. "He's not coming."

"What do you mean? He was right behind you." Her voice shook as the flood crawled its way up her waist. "He'll be here any second."

I didn't follow up with anything. Just slowly waded next to her and gently grabbed her arm.

"He's going to-" she didn't get to finish before her voice broke along with her tears. She held back choked sobs and turned to me, pounding hard against my chest. "Why did you let go? Why did you let him go, Joel?"

It was a question I wondered myself. In the moment, it all seemed so clear, but now, I didn't know what to think. Bea laid into me a few more times before stumbling from the water and collapsing into my arms. Her grief was muffled by the wet cloth of my jacket. Ethan continued to not move, only keep his head down and hide from the world. I stood there, numb and lost for a few minutes before the feeling of my stomach being submerged jolted me back to the reality of the situation. I didn't want to keep going. I wished that we had never left in the first place. But there was no way back now, and we had come this far. We needed to find the exit, and Dan believed that we could.

'Get them home safe, okay?'

Without a word, I gently guided Bea to the steps. As we sloshed out of the water, Ethan lifted his head. His eyes were tear-stained and vacant. I held a hand out to him and helped him up.

"C'mon," I mumbled. "We have to keep moving."

&#x200B;

6,248.

That's how many dots were on the ceiling. At least to the best of my count. It was hard to make out the details in the dim light of dusk. On top of that, every now and then, Mark would burst into a fit of coughs, and my concern from the pained sound of them would overwhelm my desire to count dots.

After that, I would have to start over. Not that it bothered me, though; I had to keep myself occupied somehow. You never realize how long nights really are until you don't sleep through them. Then they feel like an eternity. I thought that I might be able to sleep without Andi by my side over time, but it was proving to be the opposite. As the weeks passed, I found myself lying awake longer and longer. It was like my brain was rejecting the idea that I could ever get used to not having her there. Like it was punishing me for what I had done. It wasn't the first time I had felt this. It was the same back in Arkansas after everything that happened with Rose. Back then, I had tried the old trick of counting sheep. It never helped. Now I counted dots. It never helped either, but at least it passed the time.

I began again, '1, 2, 3, 4….'

After a while, I made a game out of it. I never used any tricks to calculate 'dots per tile times the number of panels in the room', and I never counted by threes or fives. I decided I had to count one by one until I got my answer. I figured if I ever got the same number multiple times, I would know that it was finally right. Then I would be done.

'188, 189, 190, 191….'

Of course, I always hoped that the numbers never matched. If I got the answer, there would be no reason to count anymore. What would I do all night? And day? I hardly left the bedroom anymore, even when everyone got up. I still came out to eat, of course. Jan made sure of that. Ethan or Bea would come in and visit me every now and then, and Daniel would check in too. They usually didn't stick around for long. I wasn't much for conversation, and I think they knew I wanted to be alone.

Mark was often the only one in the room with me. The wound on his throat had gotten much worse, and the skin around it was bruised and yellow. He wasn't exactly in any shape to get up and interact with people, so he mostly lay in bed while Jan and Benjamin took turns caring for him. However, there wasn't much we could do to help physically without medicine and antibiotics. Just comfort him and hope the festering gash would slowly heal on its own. I think we all knew it was more severe than that, however.

'2,304… 2,305… 2,306'

It was nice having Mark with me, even though we didn't exchange words with each other at all. There's something special about just being with someone. No conversation, no communication of any sort, just simply feeling their presence. I think even if he could talk to me without pain, he would have refrained; He understood that feeling as well as Andi did… I think that's why whenever he'd cough, he'd try to muffle it. Mark didn't want to disturb the moment. I often told him he didn't have to; I knew it was causing him a lot of pain. He insisted, however. Said that he knew I was sick of hearing it. I wasn't, though. Like I said, it threw off my count, and I was always grateful. Who knows how many times he had stopped me from getting it right?

'5,796… 5,797… 5,798…'

I did my best to keep up a happy face despite the obviousness of my mental state. Anytime someone came to talk to me, I would engage them and be attentive. Deep down, though, I was just hoping they'd leave so I could keep counting dots. Ethan came to check on me often but was never direct about it. He knew there was no point in asking how I was doing because everyone already knew the answer. Instead, he would just sit with me and tell me about what had been happening that day.

"We all played poker earlier. Frank won the most, obviously. No one can ever read the guy."

"Haha. Yeah."

"And Jan may be getting sick. She told Bea that she threw up this morning, so keep your distance there. I know she likes to hug."

"Is she okay?"

"Yeah, she's fine otherwise. Doesn't look like she's running a fever at all. Bea thinks it may have been something she ate."

"Could be. It wouldn't be the first time."

"Speaking of Bea, you should talk to her soon." Ethan began to fidget with his hands and looked at the floor as he continued, "She says she misses seeing you."

"I see her every day."

"Yeah, but… I mean, when's the last time you two talked?"

"Not too long ago. She was in here the other day, but it didn't seem like she wanted to talk."

"That's because she doesn't know what to say to you. She knows you're hurting."

"I'm fine, Ethan."

"Are you?"

'6,001… 6,002… 6,003…"

"Joel?"

"Huh?"

Ethan sighed, "Never mind."

"I'm sorry, I'm just… I'll come out soon, okay?"

"You don't have to."

"No, I want to."

"Okay." There was a long pause before he continued, "What happened wasn't on you. You know that, right?"

Mark shifted across the room, sensing the shift in tension.

"Ethan. I am fine."

"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone." Before he left the room, he turned back to me, "We're going to all have a gathering and talk tomorrow night if you want to join. Don't feel like you have to, though."

I wish I had stopped him and told him I was sorry. That I knew I was being a jerk. There's a specific window to apologize to someone, and when you don't for long enough, it stains into the relationship, always silently there in everyone's memories after. For those months after Andi died, I wasn't much of anything to anyone, and I got a lot of my relationships dirty. The sad part was I didn't really care. It was what I wanted to happen. I just wanted to count dots.

'6,245… 6,246… 6,247… 6,428."

6,248.

Huh.

&#x200B;

It wasn't the most beautiful place, and it would be a pretty dangerous spot to risk setting up in. Then again, I could describe the hills above the same way, and that's where we usually made our graves. Besides, Dan deserved the best we could find, and we all felt confident that this would be it. The floor we found ourselves on was a mall, old and still, its neon and fluorescent lights only functioning in a select few places. We traveled through the area, saying nothing to one another until Bea finally spotted something down a corridor.

"Over there."

As soon as we saw what she was referring to, Ethan and I agreed. We shuffled down the pink neon-lit corridor until we reached the opening. It was a large room that rose several balconies up, with hardly any working lights, save for a few colorful tubes lighting the edges. The corners of the place were dark, but right in the center before us, a single spotlight shined down from the ceiling several stories above us onto a planter display in the middle. The fake plastic plants within were covered in dust and mold, but their color still broke through, and they looked real enough from a distance. The main focus, however, was the giant tree in the center.

It, too, was fake, but the amount of detail could have fooled anyone. It really wasn't important how it looked, and we knew that. The likelihood of anyone else finding this exact spot beneath the labyrinth of the house in a place where only a handful of people had ever been was astronomical. But still, Dan lost his life in an awful place. The least we could do was lay him to rest somewhere nice.

Ethan and I did our best to clean off the plants nearby (the mold was thick and heavy), and Bea set to work etching off a smooth part of the tree. When she was finished, I handed her a marker we had been using to mark safe houses, and she removed the cap. She thought for a moment before leaning forward and writing slowly and neatly:

*For Daniel Castner*

*He gave his life so that many more could be saved.*

*May you finally find peace outside of this place.*

We all stood back and stared, reading the words over and over again. However, no matter how many times we did, it never felt right. There was too much to say about the man that just couldn't be told in a few sentences on a grave. That he had been a fantastic pillar of hope for all of us through this whole thing. That he was beyond courageous. That he always looked out for every single one of us, above and below. Even reciting all of the things Dan was in my head didn't come close to how much should have been said. When you lose someone you love, nothing ever feels like enough anymore. Only they were enough, but now they're gone. I wanted to say all of this out loud when the time came for us to speak, but I didn't have to; Every single one of us already knew.

Instead, all I could manage was, "I'm so thankful to have known… I hope you… Thank you, Daniel. For everything."

Ethan nodded and started to say something, but the words fizzled out as he wiped tears from his eyes and slipped his hands into his pockets.

"You know…" Bea softly whispered after a few minutes, "When I was really young, my dad died. I hardly even knew him. Apparently, there was an accident on a job site where he worked… I guess that's not really important. Point' is I never really knew him. But, I knew that I should've been sad; I mean, my mom was for sure, but like I said, I never really *knew* him, so how could I be?"

She paused again for a moment as Ethan, and I waited for her to continue.

"My mom remarried after a few years once I was older and… My stepdad was a pretty horrible guy. He was abusive to my mom and my sister and me, but- well, none of that is really important either. The point is I've never really had a father in my life. I was only sad that I didn't have one after knowing what a bad one looked like. It was this really sucky feeling of knowing that what I had was horribly wrong, and yet I didn't even know what it was actually supposed to be like. After a while, though, I just kind of accepted it. I figured that I wasn't missing out on much. But then I met you. In the worst place of my life, I met you. When I needed someone the most, you were there."

Bea looked up with tear-filled eyes and took a deep breath, trying to keep her voice from breaking.

"And, you know, it wasn't until just now that I realized you were the thing that I was looking for. Someone who looked out for me. Who protected me. Who was always there to talk when I had no idea what to do. You were the person I was so sad I didn't have in my life. And now you're-" She let slip a handful of sobs before trying to push onward. "I never really knew my real dad, and I never got to grieve him. But I am so grateful that I can say I had someone in my life who gave me an idea of what it should feel like."

We waited there for a long time, staring at the memorial. None of us wanted to leave. As soon as we did, we knew we would probably never see this place again. This was all we had left of Daniel other than our memories, and the worst part about those is that they often fade. We waited for hours. We waited until my watch chimed morning, and we waited until my watch chimed night. We waited until a sharp *Tink plink* echoed down the mall corridors, and we couldn't wait any longer. In silence, we scooped up our belongings and took off down a dark tunnel, barely even bothering to run. We would run if we knew it was after us. For now, we didn't care. For now, nothing really mattered.

&#x200B;

'1,209… 1,300… 1,301…'

"Hey brother."

'1,302… 1,303… 1,304…'

"You and I both know you don't want to do that. Not really. You think you do, but you don't."

'1,305… 1,306… 1,307…'

"You've already committed to the rules in your mind, haven't you? That's why you don't want to."

'1,308… 1,309… 1,400…'

"Eight, seventy-two, forty-six, nineteen."

'1,401… 1,402-'

I breathed a deep sigh, "What do you want?"

"Is that why you're being so curt with everyone? Because you know you'll win eventually?"

"No. I just don't feel like talking."

"Yeah, alright. Sure."

'1, 2, 3, 4….'

"You're being selfish, you know. They're all hurting just as much as you are."

"I don't know what to say to them."

He sighed, "I don't know why you so often willfully misunderstand me. I mean, you're being selfish by counting those dots."

"They'll be fine."

"You've been shut up in this room for months now. You're basically already gone, and they clearly are not fine. Ethan tip toes around you now; Bea is so lost she barely knows how to talk to you anymore, Jan's worried sick about you-"

"They don't know what I'm going through."

"That's a load of crap."

"I loved her."

"So did they."

"Not like I did."

"Oh, shut up, Joel. Don't even act like that drop of a girl meant a damn thing to you in the ocean of women you've been with. She was another Sarah to you; just some chick you used to numb the pain from Rose."

"I'm sick of you."

"Yeah, I'm sick of you too. Always just wallowing in your guilt and then acting like someone owes you something for the mistakes you made? You know, you should just keep counting those specks on the ceiling. Maybe if we're all lucky, you'll finally figure out how many there are."

I reached behind me to my stuff, snatched up one of my shoes then threw it in his direction as hard as possible. However, by the time I had turned back, he was already gone, and the boot slammed harshly into the wall with a loud thud. A second later, a concerned Jan peered into the room.

"Joel? Is everything okay? We heard a loud bang in here."

I turned to the door, and upon seeing Jan's dismay, my rage quickly dissipated. "Oh, um, yeah. I'm fine.

I just saw a spider on the wall." I said, pointing to the boot.

"I thought you always put them outside?" she asked. I knew she was clearly asking because my routine had changed, which worried her.

"Oh, yeah, I guess I just figured they'll find a way back in anyways." I lied. "Besides, that was Andi who always got me to do that."

Jan could hear the solemn tone my voice took on and stepped into the room, taking a seat next to me. She smiled as she stared at the floor, "Too scared to do it herself, but sweet enough to not kill them."

I looked up at the dots on the ceiling, "And yet she turned out to be the brave one."

'1, 2, 3, 4….'

Jan frowned and nervously picked fuzz from the blanket she sat on. "You should come join us. We're all having fun talking. Even Mark came out…"

"That's alright. I'm not feeling the best. Maybe I will later."

"Joel, you haven't come out in a long time. Everyone is worried about you."

"You mean you are?"

"Yes, Joel. I am part of everyone. I care about you. I just don't want to see you end up…."

"End up what? Like Larry?"

She shifted in place, "No. I just- things are already miserable enough in here. You don't need to make things worse for yourself."

"I just need time to think, Jan. Please."

The woman looked longingly at the floor. "Okay." She stood up and crossed back to leave. With her hand on the knob, she turned back, "Hey, Joel?"

"Yeah?"

"We all love you. I love-"

"Jan." I snapped before she could finish.

I didn't want her to. I couldn't handle hearing it. Especially when I was so close to figuring out the dots. The way she winced hurt a lot more than hearing it, however. So did the way she apologized before leaving. He was right. I was selfish. They were all hurting, and I was just deciding to hurt them even more. Before I could think about it further, I launched back into counting. When the thoughts tried to catch up to me, I went faster, laser-focused.

'325, 326, 327, 328-'

Still, they relentlessly invaded. It hurt. Everything hurt. I was awful, and I knew it. I began to count out loud, and tears blurred the corners of my eyes. I was trapped. Trapped in my own mind and trapped in this damn house. There was only one way out, and it was through the dots. Yet as I counted further and further, I couldn't help but feel more and more terrified. The number climbed, and there was no one to stop me. I prayed that Mark would cough from the corner, but he wasn't there. I hoped that maybe He would come back and harass me some more. Mess me up again, scream at me, do anything, but he never did. I couldn't stop on my own, however. That was against the rules. My throat tightened as the end drew near. I could see the last row approaching, and one by one, my eyes ticked them off. When I reached the final number, my breath steadied, and all the chaos in my brain fell into a gentle peace.

6,248.

That's how many dots were on the ceiling, and now I knew for sure. I lay there for a while longer, just looking up at the white panels full of tiny holes. There was no longer any reason to count them. I had nothing left to do. With that, I sat up and looked to the bedroom door. I could hear conversation from the other side. It sounded happy. Content. I remember being glad about that. I wanted them to be happy and content. I stood up from my spot and stepped over to the door, placing my hand on the handle. I hesitated for a moment.

"What are you waiting for?" He asked behind me. "Go have fun with them. Live it up tonight. You got your damn number."

&#x200B;

When Daniel and I set out into the house, we were always on alert. Every step, every corner, we were always listening and looking out for any danger. The same was true for when Bea and Ethan caught up to us. None of us knew what to expect below the house, and the one thing we did know to expect was a creature that no one could possibly imagine. We didn't care to find out what else could be down here. After a few months, however, we had gotten somewhat used to navigating the halls, rooms, and sprawling structures. We knew when to be quiet and when to move slow. When to rest and when to hide. In between, however, we got comfortable talking to one another. It really did help to pass the time. An odd wonder came with exploring the intricate structure and seeing all of the strange places that ended up here, yet traveling through it for so long in silence would be enough to drive anyone insane, even with taking breaks and stopping.

Without Daniel, though, no one felt like talking. We shuffled through the encroaching roads of the unknown structure like wandering husks, chasing the flame of an exit with no idea how to get there. We were alive and still on our journey, yet it felt like we had already lost. Daniel didn't need to die. Andi didn't need to die. Mark didn't need to die. Larry didn't need to go insane. From the second we got here, it had just been one hit after the next. If you wanted to be really pessimistic, one could even say that Hillary dying was our defeat. Even if we found the exit, even if we escaped the house and got out of this place, we weren't going to be leaving with everyone who came in, and that in itself was a loss. The game was over before it even started. The ship had already set sail, and the only other option was to try and row across the ocean with whoever else got left behind.

These were the thoughts that haunted you as you traveled through the musky, mold-ridden maze. It was that, or constantly think about what horror you may face next. I always opted for the former; less stressful that way. I thought of Andi a lot, as I often did. This whole time we had thought there were only a couple rooms below us and that she had died when all the while, she was venturing through an impossible space entirely on her own. I wondered how many of the same rooms we had come across? How many times she had narrowly avoided danger? I thought about all of the moments she pushed herself onward even though she had no clue what lay beyond the next door. At least we had reasonably solid proof that there was an exit. She was going on nothing at the time. Just a broken promise and a radio broadcast.

I wondered if she had ever thought of me. When we stopped to rest at one point, I reached into my pocket and pulled out the old note she had left me. It was so wrinkled and waterlogged that I barely even recognized it. After debating for a long time, I opened it, needing to know if the words were really the way I remembered them. The familiar writing was gone, however. Just smears of ink and grains of pulp.

While in my head, I often thought of my life before, which was something all of us couldn't help but do. It came up frequently in conversations about escape. 'What's the first thing you're going to do when you make it out?' and 'What do you miss most about life before?'. It's an overused statement, but the old saying, 'you never know what you've got till' its gone' really is true. I missed so many things from the world that I had never even thought twice about.

Of course, there were the big things. People, comfort, and not living in constant fear for your life. But then there were all the small things. Warm showers with fresh water, food that didn't come in a can or vacuum-sealed package, trees and Just being able to go outside and *be there*. The thing I missed most of all was the night sky. It was so beautiful and intricate, and in Arkansas, you could see so many stars. On full moons, the whole countryside would be lit with this gorgeous dim light, and I would just sit out there for hours with Rose, talking and laughing. Holding her and not worrying about anything in the world. I also sat outside with Him a lot when we would talk. We would sneak beer from his stepdad, climb out the window, and sit on the roof, just looking up and thinking about the future.

&#x200B;

"You think we'll stay in touch as time goes on?" He once asked me.

"Yeah, man, of course. Why wouldn't we?"

"I dunno. I see a lot of friendships fall apart after high school. I just don't want that to happen."

"It won't, dude. You've been my friend since, like, 5th grade. There's no chance we could just move on from that. I care about you too much to lose you."

"Yeah," He smiled, "I guess you're right."

&#x200B;

It's funny how thoughts can chain together and pull you into whole new ones. Like how recalling fond memories of people you once knew can dredge up negative ones. The nights I sat beneath the moonlight alone without Rose, looking up at the stars with tear-filled eyes. The day that He told me He never wanted to talk to me again.

I think back to that night on the roof a lot, mainly due to the question he asked me. It seemed so obvious. So true. I wasn't lying when I told him we would always be friends. How could I be? I didn't know the future. I didn't know what I was going to do yet. If I had known, I would have told him then and there that he needed to get far away from me. That I was bad for him. That I would only hurt him in the long run. Maybe my answer wouldn't have been a lie if only I had had a little more self-control. If I hadn't been such an emotional wreck. If I hadn't been such an awful person. If I *wasn't* such an awful person...

I always wondered if he had heard I had gone missing; If all of my friends had. Would he still not want to talk to me once I got out? Was he sad when he was told? Maybe no time at all had even passed in the real world. Maybe when we got back, my life would be just as tangled up as I left it. I wanted to fix it all so bad, but I didn't know how. How do you fix things when the thing you broke doesn't want to be fixed?

'You hop on a bus and drive far, far away.' I had told myself. 'Start over.'

My watch beeped softly on my arm, alerting us that it was now night above, but we continued onward. We didn't sleep nearly as much as we used to, and we had been moving almost non-stop for a month.

As before, the floors seemed to get more and more complex, but now they could hardly even be called 'floors'. They were just entire buildings and strange complexes smashed together at random. There were still small rooms filling the spaces between, but for the most part, every new place felt like it could be its own contained structure. There were the aforementioned malls, but there were also things like airports and stadiums. Indoor waterparks with grimy, chlorine-filled pools, old warehouses littered with unfinished projects, vacant hotels with buzzing lights illuminating their empty hallways.

The simple goal we had always strived for of 'find the next staircase' became obsolete at this point. There were now staircases everywhere, leading to different floors of their own buildings or new ones. Instead, we changed our aim to always take whatever path led down; however, even this proved a challenge. The layout of the monuments made absolutely no sense, often leading to dead ends or looping in circles. Sometimes we would have to go up a flight of steps to find a longer way down. We hardly ever knew when we had passed one threshold into the next.

Conversation was at a minimum for those weeks of travel, and it wasn't until one day when we had stopped to eat that we had our first conversation in a long time.

We all sat in a skyscraper lobby, passing around a can of cherries and sitting in dusty, modern-style furniture. Across the room at the main desk, a single lamp cast its humble light into the sprawling room and up into the numerous balconies above us. As we each took our turn popping the sickly sweet long expired 'fruit' into our mouths, I noticed Bea and Ethan just staring vacantly at the ground. I could tell we were all tired and worn from our time down here. We were home sick for even just the house above. What I wouldn't give to see Ben tinkering with some junk in the corner, or Grace and Claire playing euchre in the dining room. Heck, I even missed Frank's quiet and somber presence. I missed Jan a lot too. Her warm and kind expression that made you know she cared about you. That she loved you. I hated that I had never let her tell me that. I hoped that someday I would get the chance to tell her back.

"How are you guys holding up?" I asked, forcing my stiff throat to make a sound. Bea and Ethan looked up at me like I had just spoken another language. To be fair, it was a question nobody had heard in a while. None of us had been okay, so why bother asking? After a moment, however, Ethan responded.

"I'm alright, I think. I mean, everything still really sucks, but um… Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay."

"I'm okay, too," Bea said, offering a very halfhearted smile.

"Good," I said. "I'm glad."

"Are you?"

"Yeah."

"Good."

"Yeah."

Things fell silent again, but it felt odd now like a seal had been broken. Ethan seemed to notice.

"Nice going, Joel. You weren't supposed to talk. Now that we remembered we can, all of our silence is just awkward silence."

Bea and I gently laughed while I pulled out the third notebook from my backpack and flipped it open. The maps were now beyond translation to anyone who wasn't me; pages covered in intricate lines, notes, and symbols. With the structures getting more complicated, it only made it harder to keep up. I had tried explaining how to read it to everyone, and for the most part, they seemed to be able to glean some things; however, I think a lot of it was lost to them. As I jotted down the current path we had just taken, Bea stood and peered over my shoulder.

"My goodness, Joel. Are you even making a map still? It looks like trigonometry homework."

"Hey, back off. This is hard stuff to do, you know. Be glad that you're not the one stuck doing it."

"I think we're all glad." Ethan snickered, "Bea sucks at drawing."

Bea finished drinking the juice from the can before hucking it at him. Ethan laughed and then stood, making his way to the bathroom across the lobby. "Signal if something's wrong. I gotta use the bathroom. Thank goodness we got trapped in a place that has plumbing, right?"

Bea sat down on the seat next to me and then watched me jot a few more notes down before placing the map back into my bag. I leaned back against the couch, and she breathed a deep sigh before resting her head against me.

"How much further do you think we have?"

"It's hard to say." I told her, "We've been going for about six months now? Andi was down here for a year, but she also made the trip back up. Plus, we don't know what kind of challenges she faced. If we've had this many adventures down here, I can't imagine what she must have gone through."

Bea shifted uncomfortably and pushed up closer to me. "Yeah."

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing. I'm fine."

"Bea. what's wrong?"

"Nothing, I just… I want to go home, Joel."

I could tell that wasn't really what she wanted to say, but we were all still emotionally tender, and I didn't want to push anything. Instead, I changed the subject, "How come you never told me you had a sister?"

"I don't think I remember *ever* telling you that."

"Well, technically, you didn't. But you mentioned it during Dan's memorial."

"Oh yeah. I forgot about that." She said distantly. "I do. A half-sister.

"You excited to see her?"

I felt her shake her head. "I mean, I am. I loved her. But I don't think she'll be too happy to see me."

Not wanting to rehash the conversation with Daniel about his wife, I pulled back a bit. "Oh, I'm sorry I brought it up, Bea."

"No, it's okay. It's good to think about. I think we've been in here so long that I kind of put thinking about my actual life on hold in case I never got back to it."

"Ain't that the truth," I muttered.

"I just… I really screwed her over big time when we were younger."

"How bad is 'big time'?"

Bea began digging at the back of her hand with her nails. "I, um. Well, when she needed me most, I kind of... left her. Then she got really hurt because of it, and I wasn't there to stop it. So now she blames me- which she's right to. It was on me." I watched her dig harder into her skin and slowly reached my hand up and covered hers. It was trembling and warm, and she instantly parted her fingers, allowing me to lace in mine. "I never got to apologize to her. Tell her that I was sorry for not being the big sister I should have."

"You'll get the chance, Bea. When we get out of here, you'll get the chance."

She chuckled darkly at my remark, "If we get out of here. And besides, she'll probably be more mad at me. All of my family probably thinks I just ran off again."

She went silent for a second, and her hand went still. I squeezed it and turned my head to the top of hers, and softly kissed it. "I'm sorry, Bea. How come you never talked to me about any of this?"

She shrugged, "I was afraid to. I don't know why I just was." She lifted her head and looked at me, "But I'm glad I did now. I like talking to you, Joel. Even when it's about shitty things. It makes me feel better."

"I'm glad you did too. I always love talking with you. I feel like it's been a while since we've actually gotten to."

Bea chuckled, "Yeah, that's true. Pretty much since we left."

"Oh man, that is true. Gosh, once we get out of here, I'm taking you out, and we're going to have a long conversation."

She raised her eyebrows, "Are you asking me out, Joel? Because that sounds like a date."

My face must have turned bright red, "W-what? No, I just meant like-"

Bea laughed and shoved my shoulder, "I'm kidding. Calm down." I smiled and laughed with her, but her expression grew sad once again as the joy died down. "Hey, can I ask your opinion on one last thing? About my sister?"

"Yeah, of course. What is it?"

"I um… Well, it's kind of weird. I just wanted to know if you thought so too."

"What?"

"Well, I…"

"Bea?"

"Never mind."

"Oh, come on! Just tell me!"

"No, you'll think I'm crazy."

"Bea, please. Now I'm just worried. What's wrong?"

She took a deep breath and stared at the floor. "Well, it's been going on since around when we first got here. I don't know if it's just guilt or if I'm going insane or what, but…."

"But…?"

"Well, I still see her. My sister, I mean. Like, I see her all the time, but she's obviously not really there. But I can see her clear as day, and she always says awful things to me, and… is that weird? …Joel? …Joel, are you okay?"

My face had gone from bright red to ghost white in seconds. I stared at Bea with an expression of pure shock as my body began to feel incredibly light. The cherries in my stomach wanted to come back up, but I held them down with a deep swallow. I suddenly felt unsafe, as if there were eyes somewhere in the darkness watching us.

"You think I'm crazy, don't you? I promise I'm not, I just-"

"No, Bea." I said quietly, "I don't think you're crazy."

"Are you sure? You look really freaked out."

Suddenly, behind her, I caught movement from the corner of my eye. From a balcony up above where we stood, He looked down on us from the shadow, resting his hands on the railing and smiling with unnerving calmness. Bea noticed that I was looking behind her and turned to see why, but as she did, He too turned around and walked off into a hallway.

"Joel, What's going on?"

"Wait here," I commanded before brushing past her in a sprint toward the stairs.

"Huh? Joel! Wait!" Bea called out.

It was too late. I had already thrown open the door and was halfway up the steps. It was stupid. I knew it was. It was incredibly dangerous to pursue something that I knew was a threat. But I had to know. I needed to find out what the thing that had been haunting me the last four years was because it certainly wasn't in my head anymore.

So why was it pretending to be?
