My sister tried some spells from that site too. Once, she woke me up in the middle of the night, holding a pen and a scrap of paper. She asked me to write down the name of someone I hate. I couldn’t write her, and I didn’t really hate anyone else. So I picked someone at random, Hannah, someone I knew of but never talked to, no one to me. My sister didn’t tell me anything else and left.

For a while, my sister had me transcribe all of Eudice’s spells and rituals, most wouldn’t work unless she had more power, and she was too nervous to try the rituals to get her that power. So she got bored of my transcribing, made me go back to play D&D with her, went back to the stuff from that site.

Hannah’s parents both died. She was out of school for a while, somehow everyone knew why. I learned much later her adopted parents were abusive, her test scores plummeted, would have trouble finding a job. My sister was excited to hear about her parents, the curse had worked, she’d use it on whoever she wanted to then. Destroying doesn’t take much effort.

My sister started going hunting with our grandfather, had him buy her a bow and some arrows, joined the archery club at her private school. Our parents weren’t rich, my sister had gotten expelled from the town's public schools. The town paid for her tuition there, the third and first private school she wasn’t expelled from after a year. They apparently had trained people on standby at all times to restrain students, my sister would put me in the restraint hold sometimes. I can’t remember it exactly anymore, essentially, they’d sit on the students.

My sister went to as many therapists too, none of them helped. My parents didn't know why she struggled so much with school, had to bribe her to get her to go some days. Eventually I guess they had tried everything, stopped trying to fix her. The college fund they'd been saving for her, their firstborn, was now for me, not like she was going. I'm sure the reason she didn't try was because she didn't want to be anything in that world, she wanted to be powerful in the world I was stuck in.

My parents forbid my sister to use her bow anywhere besides the ranges she’d sometimes visit, but she’d sneak out into the woods with them. She never brought me, said I’d get in the way. I know now she was hunting deer, turkey, rabbit, fox, even a cougar once. She’d drain their blood into empty water jugs, then dump their bodies into the pond behind the tall grass. When she finally had everything she needed, she came to me for Eudice’s help.

This next ritual required more than two people, she’d been hunting at school too. Every boy she’d been fucking gathered with us outside the pond at night. Gabe, I don’t actually know if she’d slept with him, he was her oldest friend at this point. I remember him almost fondly, the three of us sat around and watched Naruto clips or played Runescape. He was nice to me, even if it annoyed my sister. Jessie, he either ignored me or acted tough. I’m pretty sure he once said “What are you looking at?” to me. My sister said he was schizophrenic. Mike, he was a creep who thought he was cool, would sometimes compliment me in weird ways, joked I had a crush on him. I heard, I think after this, that someone had accused him of rape. He was my sister’s first sexual partner. Victor, he was nice the few times we talked, but my sister told stories of him convincing people to come with him into the woods or a graveyard and then beating the shit out of them. They all knew she was sleeping with all of them, I don't think they cared. I thought so much about her sex life as a kid, but in hindsight I think that was the only healthy thing about their friend group.

I hadn't spent much time with any of them. I didn't know how much they knew about what my sister had done, about me, if they believed any of it. But they were here, in the middle of the night, willing to drink blood. I knew they weren't good friends, I still wonder what they thought they'd get out of this.

The moon was waxing and bright, but the trees still had their leaves and the faint light barely broke through. My sister carried an electric lantern, currently on the ground in the middle of us all, standing in a circle, pond covered in algae on one side, tall grass on the other. I could barely see them, all wearing jackets to keep out the chill from the wind. I did too, the cold still got to me, just not as much as before.

My sister gave each of us a jug, it doesn't matter what creature's blood it is, you just have to have killed it. We all started drinking, there was a lot of gagging, Gabe almost threw up, which would've ruined everything immediately. It took quite a while, they all struggled to get the second half down a sip at a time, but somehow we did it.

I don't understand how they possibly could've. My stomach and even my throat were gone, so I just dumped it in my mouth in one go. It felt wrong just sitting inside of me, but no stranger than the food or water I've had to pretend to eat. I'd dump it out of my head into a toilet as soon as possible, but I couldn't do that here.

My sister didn't drink, the performer of the ritual, the killer, doesn't. After drinking the last drop, none of the participants are to let anything leave their body, no words or sounds or spit or piss or tears or blood or snot or even air. They all stood there, struggling not to breathe while my sister read the words to start the ritual in earnest. You don't have to be anywhere in particular, you don't need to set the scene, you just all have to be within sight of each other.

The words were in Latin, a language I knew then but have forgotten now. I remember what it meant in English, again, the language doesn't matter. "I demand your attention, because I know I'll do better than you've seen before. Your challenge is but a game to me, and I've already won."

My sister closed her eyes, and we all ran away. The game is essentially hide and seek, she waits for 15 minutes, then has to catch us before 24 hours. There's no punishment if you get caught, or reward if you do. Only the killer can win a reward, but not just by winning, you have to do it impressively. So we can't just let her catch us, we have to try to win too.

I followed them as they ran back out of the woods. They weren't struggling not to breathe anymore. Eudice knew from experience that after the words are said, our audience relieves the players of any needs that would get in their way. I figured it must still be hard for them not to do it out of habit. I struggled to remember to pretend to breathe. I'm sure that the knowledge of what would happen if they failed to keep everything in helped motivate them.

I assumed it would be easy for me, but as I ran, I found myself breathing in, a lie from gym class. The blood in my skin would grow hot from fear, remembered each time not to breathe back out. The thorn covered brush blocking the way out of the woods slowed all of us down. I had never made it through them without at least getting pricked, but I had never really cared to. If I stepped carefully, made sure the bottom of my sneakers was all that ever touched them, I was fine.

Splitting up seemed like a good way to take up her time, but when I saw them all running together towards the house I assumed they were going for the car Mike used to bring them all here, and driving as far away from her as possible was a smarter plan. I hoped they'd let me come along.

Mike got in the driver's seat of his black truck, Jessie into the passenger seat, Gabe and Victor into the backseat. I tried to get in after Victor, but he pushed me back out, shook his head sternly, and closed the door. Gabe got out on the other side. Mike looked at him annoyed, Victor disgusted, then they drove off, out of the driveway and down the road to the right.

Gabe beckoned for me to follow him, led me back through my yard, into the woods, to the other side of the pond. I made sure to step even more carefully through the less traveled path. We hid behind some brush, watched my sister, only barely visible from her lantern. It seemed to me like a pretty good hiding spot. My sister would probably assume everyone would go to the car, and seeing it gone, she'd go after them. If she managed to catch them it'd take her forever to get back here.

My sister did just that after the 15 minutes were up, we watched her walk out of the woods towards the house. I was glad, I didn't really see any way she could even catch the others. I didn't want her to win. If she got power she'd only do riskier and riskier things. I didn't want anything bad to happen to her, turned inside out, personality replaced. As much as I hated her, I wanted her to be happy. I thought maybe she'd finally be nice to me if she was happy.

Gabe tapped my shoulder and showed me his phone, a smart phone, something my sister had only just gotten on her 16th birthday. He had a note app open and had written on the page "sorry, they had said before we shouldn't take you with us because your sister could order you to do things, I disagreed, obviously."

It was a smart assumption. He put the phone in my hands to respond. I think I asked "why are you here with me?"

He typed "a kid shouldn't be alone outside in the middle of the night. It's scary."

I felt kind of annoyed being called a kid. "If you know what happened to me, why would you think I'd be scared?"

"I figured that it would've made you more scared."

I was scared of being alone, that my master would call to me, but the place didn't matter. Although I was scared of all the things Eudice knew to live in the woods too. Gabe being with me didn't make me feel less scared. I knew he was going to die, a fairy would kill him or my master would tell me too. But being talked to felt nice.

My sister told me once he was Jewish, so I asked him about that. It had annoyed my sister, she took pride in converting Jessie to atheism. Gabe's devotion to an unseen God, even when given proof of the ungodly, made her think he was an idiot. I wanted to know why.

I can't remember exactly what he told me. I really wish I did, I remember trying to fish his phone out of the pond to find it exactly, but the phone was broken. What I remember is that even if she had proven God wasn't real, he'd still believe in Him. Whether He's a force created by his community or our actual creator, the good He does for him and his community is real.

I really wanted to believe in something good and loving that wouldn't turn me inside out, even if it wasn't real. When I tried to read the Torah or Bible, I didn't really like their Gods either though.

"Sage, come out now!"

I stood and faced towards my sister, standing only a few feet away from us, lantern in one hand, smart phone in the other, a new backpack over her shoulder. She had caught us first.

Gabe stood up too. She glared at him. "Why are you here? It makes sense for you to leave her behind, but why would you stay with her, let me catch you both at once?"

Gabe points at me, trying to get something across. My sister doesn't react, so he starts typing on his phone.

My sister walks towards us. "I don't care why. You're ruining the game if you don't try your hardest." She takes a deep breath. "Sorry, but I can't play with you anymore. Sage, hit him in the gut."

Before either of us could react, before I even felt myself move, I felt my fist hit his stomach. Gabe doubled over and gasped for breath.

The audience for the game considers the drinking of blood as sacred. Once you've made yourself sacred, to let anything out would be a disgrace, an insult, to the audience. The game would be spoiled for them, and they'll come to kill everyone playing.

Gabe kept trying to breathe back in the air I forced out of him, but he couldn't, it looked more like he was gagging. Saliva started to leak out of his mouth, my sister laughed. His eyes darted desperately between us, pleading for help. I wanted to, I really did. Then it was pouring out of him, the saliva soon turning red. Blood dumped out of him like a waterfall, his face looked paler than usual. His skin started shriveling up. He stopped looking to my sister, we held eye contact, the pleading look was gone, there was just fear. It was almost impossible to keep my cries and screams inside. Gabe collapsed onto the ground, but the blood still spewed out of his mouth, like a sprinkler now. His blood didn't all fall back down to the ground, and the blood that had pooled started to rise into the air. It didn't take any shape, just swayed gently back and forth, like waves in a lake. I watched as his eyes stopped looking like anything at all.

I didn't understand why my sister had killed him. I knew they were drifting apart since they didn't go to the same school anymore, but they were still friends once, to want him dead just for not taking this seriously enough seemed beyond even my sister.

I only understand now that she had been trying to impress our audience. They value arrogance and boldness highly, to accept the capture of someone who hadn't been trying their hardest would look pathetic. To willingly lose someone and play directly against the audience would look powerful. It was probably always my sister's plan, whether she knew it would be Gabe or not. Killing an old friend for power did sound like my sister.

My sister took my hand and guided me away, around the pond, pouring something out as we went. She stopped, took a candle and lighter out of her jacket, lit it and placed it by the lake, then continued walking and pouring. She did that two more times. The path she followed around the lake occasionally had brush that had been torn back, she had prepared this ahead of time 

I watched the growing lake of Gabe's blood, it was deeper, bigger, wider. Its dimensions didn't seem right. It hadn't yet moved from its birthplace when my sister came back around the pond. She stopped pouring and dragged the dead body into the pond, then finished the circle. The lake started to move towards us. My sister threw a tin box from her backpack into the lake and then spoke, in latin.

"I come with what is yours to ask for more, an affront I beg you to ignore, as I put what is mine in your palm."

She later told me that the tin contained a piece of her radius that she had shaved off when she broke her arm a year ago. She had said she ran into the gym wall too hard at school, she had dropped a cinder block on it.

The lake pressed up against the barrier that was now around us. Behind me, my master rose out of the pond, wearing the bones of deer, turkey, fox, rabbits, a cougar, and Gabe, imitating the shape of my sister. Gabe's skull accented by finger, toe and ear bones looked quite close. The algae clung to them, green accents shone in the moonlight.

"Are you truly offering yourself to me, simply to get away from-"

My master said the lake's name like, the reverence a dehydrated person gives water, acceptance as you finally understand the poison flowing through your veins will kill you, and pride in knowing that you are superior to the one in front of you. The wave never gave my sister or Eudice their name, so I call them Our Better Angel of Death. I'm sure you can guess what my sister called them.

"No, it actually has nothing to do with that."

"It clearly does, clever one. Get on with the pleading."

My sister only took a deep breath and was as confident as always. I was holding in tears, certain she would be inside out soon.

"I just happened to have a great idea. There's a train that in five hours will be running along an empty valley, if you bring us there, we can derail it and bring to you a train full of what's yours."

"What's mine is not yours to offer."

"I know, that's the icing on the cake. I'm offering the train."

It sounds strange, I know, but my master craves new things to look at and understand, a train was probably too big to ever have been offered before. That wasn't included in Eudice's many notes though, my sister was grasping at straws.

"I am not a fool. I won't give you something before you offer me anything."

My sister smiles. "It's called a loan, they happen all the time among humans, and the one loaning something out always gets the better deal. I'm only asking to be brought to where the train will be, nothing else, nothing permanent, only a second of effort from you."

"I would still be a fool when I give you this second and you never return."

"If I do that you can have my sister kill me, right?"

My master stood there in silence for only a second, but the consideration washed out of him. I felt like every possible thing that could happen would be horribly wrong. I saw Our Better Angel of Death had moved away from the barrier, was flowing away through the trees, going after the others. My master had made their decision.

"Tell me where."

My sister stepped forward and showed them the screen of her phone, displaying a location on a GPS app. My master did not react, my sister stepped closer, into the pond slightly, getting algae on her shoe. I felt curiosity pour out of them as they looked at the screen. I really do think she could've just given them the phone.

Then we were standing on train tracks, in the middle of a field. To our left was what looked like endless tall grass, just shorter than me. To our right, was a sharp rocky cliff edge leading into an empty grassy valley that went on alongside the train tracks until they both disappeared behind a hill ahead of us. The ground around us was soaking in water, algae still slightly visible, the circle of salt fell off the cliff and disappeared into the grass, the one candle I could see had gone out. My master was gone.

My sister jumped and clapped her hands, I saw the excitement coursing through her. "Fuck yeah. I'm a genius." She turned to me, smiling so brightly. I can't remember what kind of expression I made; I don't think I was really feeling anything anymore. My sister stopped looking at me shortly.

She slid the backpack off her and onto the ground, out of it she pulled, with both hands, some kind of metal contraption, painted black. I could barely see it, only lit by her lantern and the moon. As she attached it to the right side of the track, I could tell it ramped upwards.

It was a train derailer, my sister explained, used by railroad workers to intentionally derail train cars, or prevent accidents. She had just followed the train tracks by our house and taken it. Well, not just taken it, she said it was attached very securely, she had to use a blowtorch she stole from her shop class. The same blowtorch she pulled out of her backpack then. The light it gave off hurt my eyes as she tried to weld the train derailer to the track. She had one of those metal face cover things she probably stole too. I remember now one of her private schools had expelled her for stealing a lot from them. Our parents had to pay, and took a lot of the stuff she stole away. I guess they missed this.

"My original plan was to just fuck up the tracks with this thing, but they really do just have a fucking train derailer. The universe is conspiring for me."

I could only see faint red lines when she had finished, but I'm sure she did a horrible job. She didn't need it to be good, she just needed it not to fly off when the train hit it. The cold night air made me shiver even through my jacket. I didn't want to do this, didn't want to be out there, I'd had to kill enough people already.

The dot on the GPS app was moving quickly down a road. They were heading towards the nearest train station, she explained, it was the fastest way to get away from her they could afford. Doing the most rational thing possible was predictable, the train they had no choice but to get on passed that exact spot in five hours.

I didn't understand her plan, the train derailer would surely kill her friends, or make them gasp, either way she'd fail to catch them. I looked at her confused.

"Your thoughts are very predictable too, Sage. This is where you come in. When the train gets close, you let your bones out, climb into the train, don't worry I'll send them a text so they won't be shocked to see you, you take them off before it crashes and bring them to me."

It was then it really sunk in that she hadn't captured me yet, she only had to do one thing, and I would be out of the game. I would be free to talk and cry and turn myself right side out. I kept staring at her with the same expression.

"Yeah, when you let your bones out, that blood god will show up, so I'll be hiding far away in the field and you'll have to move fast, but you can do it."

I just kept staring, that couldn't have been the end of the explanation.

"What? It's not like it'll kill you, you're not using your blood for anything."

I didn't understand what she got out of doing this to me. I assumed, like always, that I had done something wrong, she was punishing me. I wanted to scream, ask her what it was, why wouldn't she just capture me, but I couldn't.

I understand now that it's the same thing it was with Gabe, I have to do whatever she says, I'm too easy and she wanted to show off. Gabe just happened to make a bad choice; I was the one she had always planned to exsanguinate.

She didn't explain anything to me in the moment, she didn't say anything else except "never talk about what happened with Gabe. If my friends ask, he got startled when I caught you and gasped. If anyone else asks, you have no idea."

I had assumed she'd order me to keep quiet, but everything else she had said was an order too. I had no choice but to follow her plan. It was impossible not to imagine what it was going to feel like to have all my blood leave my body. It wouldn't kill me, but it had to be painful.

My sister just stood there, looking excited and proud, completely indifferent to me and Gabe. I wish that this was the moment I realized she didn't really love me, no matter what she said or thought and that I should stop loving her. Of course, like usual, I just thought it was cool, that it was the best possible way people could be. Maybe that was a little bit Eudice as well. I decided that I would be indifferent too, for that reason, I would stop loving her. The second she told me I was going to be amazing, that there's no way I would fail with her plan, my indifference melted away.

Everything doesn't go according to her plan, of course. I like to think it went wrong specifically because of her indifference, inability to see others as people. Just as much I think it was simply my fault.

My sister sat next to the tracks and played a few different phone games, occasionally checking back on the GPS. I sat with her, watched her play a game where she connects lines, snipes people in the head, even just Final Fantasy 2 for a while. It wasn't much different than a usual day, I only ever got to watch her play video games. Maybe that's why I like let's plays now.

Just as much as I watched her, I watched the tree line far behind us, where the train tracks came out of, where Our Better Angel of Death would come out of. My sister didn't even mention the possibility they'd catch up faster than the train. When they washed away through the trees, it was fast, faster than a person. They could be faster than a car, faster than a train. Without us realizing, any second, they could've come out of those trees. My sister would be dead. I tried again to be indifferent. I was terrified.

The dot did stop at the train station and got on the train my sister wanted, raced towards us. Our only way of knowing if they'd been caught was gone, Victor's phone would stay on the train even if he died. My sister didn't show any concern, just brought two decks of Magic the Gathering out of her backpack for us to play.

She made it so my back was to the tree line while we played, after I glanced back twice, she told me to stop. I knew my sister wasn't paying attention, something could've been coming up behind me every second. I wanted to take a deep breath so bad, an old habit I hadn't thought about in so long. My dad told me that whenever I got anxious, I should take a deep breath of it, take the anxiety in, then breathe it back out. I took so many deep breaths in, anxiety swirled inside my chest, growing forever. I tried to use my peripheries to look back, but I couldn't see anything.

It never stopped growing, but eventually I got used to it, started to get bored. I knew, eventually, I'd get so bored I'd forget not to breathe out, or simply say something. I tried to keep myself attentive, nervous, but my efforts were getting lazier.

We got up and started to pace around, she told me a story. It was another thing we did often, she would create a new person for me to be, a new world for me to be in, a new situation for me to be in. It was my choice what I did, although I mostly just asked what she thought I should do. It was the thing we did together I was most likely to enjoy. I have no idea what story she told me that night, they all blend together, and I've forgotten most of them.

As the train got closer, I knew I would be the one to take my own blood out. It didn't feel any better, an incomprehensible horror was still coming up from behind me, when it caught me, I would lose control of my body.

My sister got more and more excited, until she told me to do it in ten minutes, and then ran off into the grass. I just watched her go, didn't look back at what I knew was behind, what I could feel coming closer. I tried so hard to be indifferent, I really did, but at the 5 minute mark, I let a tear fall.

I didn't realize what I had done, I thought I had just given up and let myself start sobbing. When I stopped myself from breathing out, I understood. I couldn't stop myself from crying, more and more was pouring out. My eyes burned, sight started turning red, they were pouring out blood.

My body was still under my control, I thought. I wanted to pull my skin down right then, but my body wasn't under my control. I had to wait for 4 more minutes.

My vision faded as the pain became excruciating, then I could see nothing. I imagine my eyes shriveled up into mush, then fell out in the waterfalls of blood I could feel coming out of my sockets. I felt it pour through my fingers.

I didn't have as much blood in me as a normal person though, my heart was gone. There was some in my skin and eyes, I'm not really sure what it was doing there, if it was still flowing. I could tell then it had been keeping me warm, the cold wind tore through me.

I had 1 minute left, took my coat and hat off, got even colder. What would Our Better Angel of Death do if they finished forming before I could go? Kill all my sister's friends, of course. I grabbed the opening in my skin on my head, it felt wrong and dry. I counted the seconds. The waterfalls became a trickle.

I pulled my skin down, it felt stiffer, harder to get down. I forced it, tore it slightly, nothing about my appearance I could save anymore. My sight returned as I reached out of myself. Our Better Angel of Death stood washing back and forth in the air in front of me, but it wasn't going anywhere yet. I forced the rest of my skin down as fast as possible, trying not to look at how strangely pale it is. The inside was just as pale though.

I made myself like a wheel to move as fast as possible alongside the tracks. Our Better Angel of Death wasn't moving by the time I went behind the trees, they could go after my sister, but I couldn't do anything besides what she said.

I could hear the train, see its lights. Gabe's blood was nowhere to be seen; it hadn't caught up. The train rushed past me, I pushed myself off the ground and landed on the roof. I gripped both edges and reached two of my arms over the side, smashed them through a window. Screams erupted out from the hole. I grabbed the sides of the window and slipped my body through.

The people moved as far away from me in their seats as they could, some screamed, most ran. They definitely thought I was going to kill them, at least I didn't have to. I held myself above the seats, in the aisle between, and looked over the faces of the cowering people. Her friends weren't in that car, so I pushed my way through the connecting doors, through each car towards the front of the train, until I reached a cart without seats, filled with people hiding behind counters that sell food. They must've been the other way; Our Better Angel of Death could've caught up at any second. I remember being so scared of disappointing my sister. I plowed back through the cars, pushed anyone out of my way. They weren't on the train; I reached the last car and never saw them.

Did they put their phone on the train and then leave? Did they jump off when they got my sister's text? Did Our Better Angel of Death get them already? Did I not pass their blood because they got my sister too? Was it already over? I wanted to give up, but I had to search the train until I found them.

I tried to be indifferent, calm myself down, and think logically, like my sister. Their bodies would be here if they'd been caught. It would make the most sense for them to have reacted to her text but jumping off the train is nonsense. They could be hiding; I didn't check the bathrooms.

There's two in every car, all of them were occupied. When I pried them open, most were packed full of strangers hiding in terror from me, screaming when I broke the door onto them. After several I broke down a door with no screams on the other side. The three of them were packed in there, terrified, disgusted by me. I didn't have time to care, finally indifferent. I wrapped one of my limbs around each of them, held them close to me, in the air. Victor tried to fight himself free, but my bones couldn't break anymore.

I broke the nearest door facing out the side of the train. It smashed into the gravel so fast, sent rocks flying in every direction, bounced away into the trees. I didn't know if even I could survive a jump like that. I didn't have time to come up with a plan, the train was past the trees, my body moved itself. My three remaining limbs pushed us through the door.

The force of the landing actually hurt my bones, I thought they were going to snap. Even with three claws stabbed into the ground, I slid through the rocks. They flew up to hit me and the people I carried, fortunately not breaking their skin. Momentum and their weight made me lean toward the ground. I knew if I tumbled, they'd get seriously hurt, quickly I sent one of my three limbs out to balance myself. 

I heard it, loud metallic screeching, and refocused my awareness behind me. The train had hit the derailer. The front of it just drove off to the right, not as fast as I had imagined, just tilted off the edge of the cliff. The screeching grew louder, accompanied by screams as the rest followed.

Our Better Angel of Death was right in front us, in the light of the train my blood looked too dark, dead. They were so close to Mike, clutched in my arm. I launched myself to the side, into the trees. I was still so fast, climbing in between the trees, as much as my limbs hurt. But it was only a second before I broke through the tree line.

I bounded as far, as fast as I could through the field, crushing the grass down with each step. Our Better Angel of Death rushed after us, the harshest waves I've ever seen. They were faster than me. My sister was nowhere in sight. I wanted to think up a plan, but I couldn't think at all. I just ran as fast as I could, until a wave came crashing down only an inch from Victor.

My sister was just ahead of us, her blonde hair illuminated by the lantern. I threw the three of them towards her, my emotions gave them just enough warning to brace themselves. They landed on their hands and knees at her feet. I assumed Our Better Angel of Death would rush past me, hoped my sister would get to them first. But they didn't, I think they were annoyed they hadn't killed me.

My blood washed over my skin, seeped back in through the pores. It hurt, something was wrong, like a headache throughout my flesh. I watched as it bloated, my inside out body that I always longed to return to, distorted, swelling. A horrible pressure rose, until I exploded.

Small chunks of my flesh scattered everywhere. My bones, all that was left of me, fell to the ground, no longer connected by anything. I was still alive, I knew my soul laid safely in its new shape in my bones, but I still felt like I was gone. The last foolish way I could pretend I was still a person, and not just a pile of bones. I couldn't even be Sage anymore.

My sister won, of course. I was just able to see from the ground, through the grass. She kissed the three of them, drawing the sacred animal blood out of them, just before Our Better Angel of Death reached her. I heard them, my blood speaking aloud and in English somehow, congratulate my sister. They thought she was bold, had truly never seen someone like her.

My sister was given some of their most powerful magic, from one of the most primal beings, Eudice and Sage thought she was so cool. I can't remember what the magic was. It doesn't matter.

My blood evaporated into the air as Our Better Angel of Death vanished from this world. Victor, Mike, and Jessie rejoiced and being able to breathe again, praised, asked to see the magic. They asked about Gabe. I laid on the ground the whole time.

When they decided to sort out the whole train thing, they came to check on me. Her friends marveled that I was still alive, could communicate with emotions, said I looked fucking disgusting earlier, but in a cool way. I felt like I was part of their group. My sister told me my master would surely give me a new body.

Each of my limbs crawled along the ground slowly behind them. It wasn't long before they just carried me, my sister and Mike with two each, Victor and Jessie with one. I was just an object, Mike swung me around like a weapon.

It wasn't much effort to deal with the train, it was seriously dented and broken apart everywhere, several cars laid partially on top of each other, but it hadn't exploded, like my sister said she thought it would. It wasn’t that difficult getting down the cliff, the rocks were all big and stuck out unevenly. My arms were quite useful as climbing tools.

When they got down there, some people had climbed out of the train, tried to run from us, but they were seriously injured. My sister and her friends chased them down, got close enough to each for me to push them into the earth. The train was just as easy to submerge. They'd shove my claws onto a car and I'd just press down. They all disappeared into the dirt, along with everyone inside. I think I killed more people that night than the rest of my life combined.

Afterwards my sister made another circle of salt, lit three more candles, and used another bone shaving. Her friends tossed all of me into a pile in the circle next to my sister. They stayed out of it, of course. She said the words to summon my master.

They slipped out of the ground, in the bones of those I just killed, in the shape of my sister. The train was in the palms of their hands, looked small there, but I knew, somehow, it was the same size. My master was just that much bigger than it. I feel like I and the whole world got bigger in their presence, because there's no way they shrunk down in ours.

My sister spoke first. "So, we're good, right? You like the train?"

They're eyes stayed on the train. "You honored our second deal well, but you broke our first."

"That, that was our first deal."

"I gave you my child on the condition that you looked after her. She is of no use to me like that."

Child isn't really what they meant, said it like a story you're proud of how you told, but I felt like it meant child in that moment. I felt loved, even if they didn't.

"Yeah, that's why I brought her with me, so you could give her skin again."

"Not very clever, arrogant one, she is not yours to destroy and I am not yours to ask things of. Your skin will do well enough to replace hers."

My sister looked more terrified than I've ever seen, thought she was going to die, looked back at the salt trapping us in. My happiness at being defended melted into fear too.

I pushed my emotions out in a scream. "No please, please don't kill her, anything but that. I need her, she's my sister. There has to be another way, please."

"Always unclever you are, insult me with pleas to make your life worse. I am feeling quite cruel today, would gladly make all your lives miserable."

I didn't understand. My sister looked hopeful. "Meaning you'll let us live?"

"Miserably. I will take from you more than what is owed. And you'll stay in the care of the one who gladly kills you."

My master is standing in front of my sister in a second, their finger touching her head. She flinched away, but they were already standing over me then.

"What did you take from me?" She asked.

"You'll never know." My sister didn't dare question them again.

My master pulled the skin of some of those I killed out of the earth. They reformed, cut it apart and rearranged it, put a body together for me, inside out and connected to my limbs. I stood there, whole again, feeling fake.

"Fail me again, come to see me again, and I will kill you."

My master left. Her friends comforted her, asked if she was okay, could feel anything missing. She couldn't. I peeled my skin down, tucked my bones back inside. The skin fit even looser, my arms weren't my own, my hair felt completely different. I asked my sister if I still looked like me.

"Yeah," was all she said.

I didn't look like myself anymore when I finally saw a mirror. My skin color was slightly lighter, every freckle was in a new place, my hair was a darker brown, frizzier, my eyes hazel instead of brown, my nose slightly bigger, lips smaller, smile all wrong, every expression I made a stranger’s. Everything about me was just slightly off. No one noticed, not even my parents, but I couldn't see myself at all.

Eventually I forgot what I used to look like, did what I could to try and make the body mine, accepted it, loved things about it, made love to people with it, but I still don't see myself in the mirror. It's just a bunch of people I killed.

Not long into the walk back home, her friends asked to see some of her magic. My sister had no idea what they were talking about, it physically hurt her when they spoke of it, she forgot they had even asked at all a second after. It was clear then that my master had taken her magic.

It wasn't clear until later that they had taken her ambition too. She never asked to do another ritual for power, never spoke of ruling the world, being the president. She was listless afterwards, never really knew what to do, never did anything with her life, just kept living with her parents, playing games.

She could tell something was wrong, the question "what do you want to go to college for?" or "what job would you want?" physically hurt her. She was unhappy always, talked for hours to anyone about how unfulfilled she felt, how nothing she could do would help. She was confused about herself, it made her even angrier. She knew I had taken something from her but could never put it into words right. She hurt me a lot more for it.

If you want to try this ritual, I'd recommend you hunt animals that are from a farm, because they're most likely to be healthy, and keep the blood refrigerated so it stays that way. If you're one of the hunted, I'd recommend you not do this ritual, if your friend asks you to, stop being their friend.
