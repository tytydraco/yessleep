We buried my wife, Tara, last month. Pancreatic cancer. Stage four. The doctors gave her six months, but she lasted four. I held her hand until the last breath, and I’ve never known silence like the one that followed.

I thought I’d imagined the first text. It came three days after the funeral.

**“It’s cold.”**

That’s it. No sender name. Just the message. I stared at it for minutes, thinking it had to be a cruel prank. But I hadn’t told anyone outside our families. Not even on social media. I deleted it and tried to forget.

A week later, at 2:13 AM:

**“Where are you?”**

Now I was shaken. Same number. No contact info. No traceable ID. I replied this time.

**“Who is this?”**

No response.

I went to the cops. They said it was probably a scammer using spoof tech. Suggested I change my number. I did.

It didn’t help.

New number. New phone. I didn’t give it to anyone yet. But two nights later:

**“I can hear you crying.”**

I hadn’t told anyone I’d broken down that night. I’d sat in our bed, holding her favorite sweater, sobbing into it. My therapist said it was grief hallucinations, phantom texts. Common for widowers.

But I know what I saw. And it was getting worse.

One night I got home from work and our bedroom door was ajar. I always close it. Always. Inside, her perfume—Chanel No. 5—lingered in the air. I hadn’t opened that bottle since the funeral.

The texts changed after that. Longer. Desperate.

**“It’s so dark here. I’m trying to find you. I miss you. Please don’t leave me alone.”**

Then, the photos started.

At first, they were of our house. The front door. Then the living room. Our bedroom. Each photo was a little closer to me. The last one came yesterday—it was of me asleep on the couch.

Whoever was sending these had been inside. That broke me.

I called my brother. He stayed the night. Nothing happened. No texts. No photos. He left in the morning, probably thinking I was losing my mind.

That night, I got a video.

It was short. Just six seconds. The screen was almost pitch-black, but I could hear breathing. Then, a faint whisper.

**“Behind you.”**

I turned. No one. But when I spun back to the phone, there was a new message.

**“You moved. I was almost there.”**

I didn’t sleep.

Today, I found something under the bed. A note in Tara’s handwriting. I know it was hers—I’d recognize that looped "y" anywhere. It said:

**“Stop hiding. Let me in.”**

She used to say that when I shut down emotionally. Back when we were fighting cancer, and hope was slipping.

I think she meant it then. I think she means something else now.

My therapist wants me to go away for a while. “Change of scenery,” he said. Maybe I will.

But tonight… there’s a knock at the door.

Three knocks. Slow. Measured. I live in a gated apartment. No one should be here.

The last message just came in.

**“I see you. Open the door.”**
