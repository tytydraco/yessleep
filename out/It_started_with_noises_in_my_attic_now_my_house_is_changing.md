 I recently discovered that something has been living in my attic for God knows how long. It started nearly a week ago. I woke up to scratching sounds coming from the attic. Honestly, I was freaked out, what the hell is making those noises? My first thought was to get out of the house and let whatever it was in my attic live there , but it wasnâ€™t a rational thought, so I decided to stay. My second thought was that birds or rats or any other small animal somehow got into my attic, I liked this thought a lot better. I made myself believe it was just a small animal and then I dosed off. The day after, I thought it was just some bizarre realistic dream so I just pushed the thought of something being in my attic to the side. After making breakfast and brushing my teeth, I decided to go back upstairs to investigate the area. I noticed that the cover to the attic has been moved ever so slightly. I haven't been in my attic in months, \*there's no way I left it like that right?\* I'm not a clumsy person and I haven't noticed it before. I thought maybe the animal that was up there somehow shifted the cover. I wanted to check the rooms upstairs after that. First I checked the bathroom, nothing. Then I checked the guest room, once again nothing. Then I checked the third room and final room, which was mine, but to no avail. After, I grabbed my ladder and put the cover back into place. To be honest I am way too scared to look into my attic, horror movies have ruined my bravery.  
The next night the same thing happened, I was woken up by the sound of scratching coming from the attic. I was pissed at this point, I have been woken up again to this little shit in my attic. I got out of bed, walked out of my room and I was fully ready to go up into my attic. Suddenly I got a feeling in my gut telling me to go back in my room. I've never felt this before, it confused and terrified me. I followed my instinct and went back to my room, my back against the door for a minute or two. I decided to put a chair in front of the door before I eventually drifted off.

I was awoken at around 5 in the morning a loud thump, keep in mind I have a ton of stacked boxes in my attic, so I think that the thing up there knocked a bunch of them down. I couldn't get back to sleep so I stayed awake. At around 9 in the morning I went downstairs to make toast and coffee. As I was going back upstairs to eat my breakfast, I noticed something. There were now 4 rooms upstairs. There was always 3 rooms right? That has never existed before I swear. Am I dreaming? I go to open the door but it's locked.

I left my breakfast to call a friend to come check it out. (My friend stays over at my house from time to time so he is familiar with the layout.) When he got here, I greeted him made him a coffee and once we sat down I told him everything that has been happening. "Maybe call pest control" he suggested. But then I told him about how I noticed an extra room upstairs. He's visibly confused and asks what I mean. "I'll just show you" I said. I lead him upstairs and show him the extra door. We stand in silence for a few seconds and he says "What the fuck?". "Thank you! I'm not going crazy" I said, a sense of relief washed over me. He said that it  definitely has not been there before. He goes to open it like I did earlier, but once again it didn't open. I could see the goose bumps on his arms. We were both just standing in awe wondering how this is even possible.  
After that we both go downstairs to use my computer so we can research into how this was happening... It only mentioned this happening in dreams, which basically means just discovering yourself or whatever. Other than that, nothing helped us. I decided to let my friend stay over for the night so he can get more of an insight of what is happening, and what the sounds are. I  also had him sleep in my bed, whilst I sleep on the floor. Before going to bed, I check that all the doors are closed, just in case that thing in my attic doesn't get into any of the rooms. After that we drift off to sleep.  
I am awoken in the middle of the night again. This time it wasn't to a loud sound such as a crash or scratching. I woke up to the faint noise of a music box. "You awake?" I asked my friend, but he doesn't reply. I turned over to check on him and he isn't there. In a haze I looked around my room but he's gone, and the door is ajar. I figured he'd gone to the bathroom, or downstairs to get a drink so I got up and left my room to find him. Once I looked around the upstairs landing, I found that the attic cover was once again slightly moved, revealing a crescent of darkness, and the bathroom door is wide open with the light off, same goes for every other room upstairs. I closed all these doors, \*how are they open? Did my friend open them? I don't see why he would\*. I go to turn on the light in the bathroom, but the light bulb was shattered, the other rooms followed the same pattern. I head back into my room to collect my thoughts. \*Am I dreaming? Is this just a dream?\* I thought to myself. This all felt so unreal. I pulled myself together and assumed the worst. I grabbed the torch I kept in my bedside drawer and cautiously exited my room, heading for the stairs. I could still hear the faint melody of the music box.

As I entered my kitchen, I found that it was a terrible mess. It looked like I was burgled. The fridge door was open, the light from it illuminating the room, the shadow of a chair casting onto the oven. The drawers are all pulled out, silverware on the floor, cupboards open, gravy granules on the ground. I grabbed a knife, just in case we were being burgled. There was no sign of my friend. I checked the living room and he wasn't there either, there was no sign of anybody.  
I made the choice to head back up the stairs.

As I reach the top, I noticed something I hadn't noticed before.. There were two spaced rectangular shapes imprinted onto my carpet, right below where the attic is. As soon as I saw this I knew where my friend had gone. He used my ladder to enter the attic. How the ladder got put back into place once he had used it only God knows. I shined my torch at the gap between the cover and the hole to my attic, but it had no effect. No shadow, no light, just black.  
After attempting to see what was up there, I gave up and decided to get my ladder and set it up below the entrance to the attic. That gut feeling came back from last time, but I ignored it because I HAD to find my friend. I climbed up, my limbs trembling, the music box getting louder and I full push the cover to the side. I use my torch to find the light switch. Once I pull the switch, the light comes on, a ugly yellow glow poorly lights up the attic.  
In the corner of my attic I can faintly see my friend crouched in the corner. "Brendan?" I shouted to him. "What the hell are you doin up here man?".. no response.  
I slowly approach him, my knife and torch leaving my hands full.  
The music box was getting louder as I moved closer. Before I could get to him, he stood up, his back facing me. He wasn't wearing a shirt, his spine was unnaturally crooked and long, extending his height around a foot taller than usual. I stumble backwards. His arms and legs also start to grow, his flesh ripping as they do.  
I shouted "BRENDAN", knife pointing at him. Tears started welling in my eyes, I nearly threw up because of what I was seeing. The light was flickering as his body was being reformed, each flicker I could hear cracks coming from his bones.  
The light then finally stops flickering and it goes dark. I turned my torch on and shined it at him. My friend, or whatever that thing is, slowly turns around and faces me. It's face was contorted, but I could still make it out to be Brendan. "C-Casey" I heard it say (Casey is my name). It didn't sound like my friend, nothing like him. It sounded as if its vocal cords were heavily damaged. "BRENDAN?" I yelled. "BRENDAN?" it replied quietly. It mimicked my fucking voice perfectly. I slowly crawled backwards towards the attic hole. It kept repeating "BRENDAN?", each time it took a heavy footstep towards me. It's voice gradually got louder until it was screaming "BRENDAN?". It began stumbling towards me. I kept crawling and crawling until I fell out of my attic. I hit my head hard on the side of the ladder and fell unconscious.   
I woke up the next morning on my now blood stained carpet. The ladder was once again back into place and the attic cover was, as always, slightly open. I look between the gap of the attic, and see two eyes staring at me before quickly returning into the void of the attic once it saw I was awake.  
I've been in my room since then, I haven't heard any noises so far but im too terrified to leave my room. Does anybody know what's going on? I can still hear the music box and the extra room is still there. Please help.
