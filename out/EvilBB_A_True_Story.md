*Note 1: I tried posting this on the darknet* *and deepweb subreddits because I thought it fit those communities better, but my posts were auto-deleted. So I thought I'd try here instead.* 

This is a true story. It's the reason I stopped using the Dark Web for years. I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this \*.onion site, or has information on it.

And no, this is not a creepypasta, where something claims to be "true" for scare/shock value - this shit actually happened to me.

**Background**

*Note 2: I put a zero instead of an "O" in the word p0sts, so that this p0st doesn't get tagged as being about shopping in the darknet subreddit.*

I'm getting back in to the Dark Web now, because I'm seeing multiple countries around the world (and worryingly, Western ones) move closer towards authoritarianism and I want to have options in case our net ever gets taken down on the orders of corrupt politicians. But it made me think about why I stopped using it entirely back in 2018. Back then, I used it for the same reason I mentioned above, but also out of some curiosity, and as an alternative outlet for information I couldn't find on the regular web - like Pizzagate.

When that story was floating around, I recognized I wouldn't be able to find anything reliable through the regular web. I've been a student of the occult for many years, and knew that most of the people suddenly talking about occult topics online had no idea what they were talking about, so I dusted off Tor (which I hadn't used in months) and tried to cross paths with some fellow occult-minded internet sleuths for shits and giggles.

We know what the Dark Web is like. It's all word of mouth, essentially, and you just have to dig until you find something interesting. Dark Web search engines back then had nothing but dead links, so I hit the chans (end, nein, leftypol, etc.), the socials (like Galaxy3) and chatrooms asking anyone I crossed paths with for some directions on where I might look next. Someone gave me a link to a spider/crawler that someone had put together and suggested I started looking through some of the links it was spitting out.

The crawler was called (from memory) "Daniel's List", or something like that. It was a basic page with a  blue header at the top, a spreadsheet table on it, with 50 rows per page, that would refresh every couple of minutes. By the time you were done looking at the links on page 6 or 7, you'd hit refresh and there'd be a whole bunch of new links ready.

The table had the onion address in the first column, and then if the crawler found any further information it would put it in the subsequent columns, like the title of the page, the first couple lines of text, last time it was accessed, etc. I found some disturbing shit through that, certainly. I realized pretty quick (like, after the first 2 attempts) that if the table had just the onion address and no other information, that the link would be of pictures of kids that I didn't want to look at - so I only focused on links that had more information. No clicking on blank links on "Daniel's List", that was the rule.

But even with that rule in place, I managed to stumble across some fucked up pages, like marketplaces claiming to sell humans for slavery, bestiality porn, extreme gore/snuff films, Islamic terrorist literature/videos/chat rooms, etc. This is in addition to the usual drugs marketplaces, hacker hangouts, Neo-Nazi groups and the psychotic ramblings of paranoid narcissists you usually find out there (it seems like every dude with a manifesto puts their drafts up on the Dark Web at some point).

But despite this, I kept looking through the crawler, because I also found some pretty cool/interesting pages that fit what I was looking for.

During this time, I found the page for the '432 mystery', I found some pages for occult groups, some interesting 'dark' art projects (at least, I hope they were art projects, lots of grainy black and white videos of things that looked like they belonged in a Rob Zombie horror movie - like people in robes in a barn sacrificing a goat, and silent video of some screaming girl chained at the wrists and ankles on a table, while some other dudes stood around her with candles, etc.), as well as some "net art" types with their 90s inspired personal homepages and dark, satirical humor (surprise goatse links, for example) .

I mention all of this to give you an idea of my own personal baseline.

I saw all of this material, and wasn't put off the Dark Web at all. Actually, the fact that it was so fucked up was half the fun. I was sleuthing for info on satanic cults that might be kidnapping children, after all, so finding that dark stuff just egged me on further.

But my fun ended pretty fucking quick when I clicked on a link for "EvilBB". That's the link that made me stop using the Dark Web entirely, from mid 2018 until December 2024.

**EvilBB**

The table on "Daniel's List" had the onion link, and next to that, the title of the page as EvilBB. In the next column, it said "The Evil Bulletin Board". That's all I had to go on, and because so many users on the Dark Web are edgy types and like to call themselves 'evil', for the same childish thrill that tweens have when they try to front as being evil or wicked, I saw no harm in clicking it.

I was greeted with a standard front page for a bulletin board - blue and grey color theme, with "EvilBB" in a default font, it's full name beneath that, and then a login box with a "Register" link below. On the bottom left of the page was a line that said that there were "3 users online".

I clicked on register, came up with some username and used my burner Protonmail address, and created an account. I was in, and the counter on the bottom left said there were now "4 users online".

That's the first time I could see the titles of each of the forums on this bulletin board. The first was a "Message from the Mods" forum, next it was an introductions forum where "psychopaths can introduce themselves". But after that were the specific forums - each one devoted to some evil act one could do to another. They were for Assault/Murder, Rape, Kidnapping, Torture and, finally, the "Evil General" forum for any act that didn't fit into the above.

Right away my bullshit meter started going off. I immediately thought that these were all edgy dickheads writing fanfics about what they would do to other people if they weren't just keyboard warriors.

But I was wrong.

The first link I clicked was the kidnapping forum. The most active link, at the top, was from a user who claimed that they had kidnapped a 10 year old boy and were holding them captive in their basement, and torturing them for fun. They were asking for ideas on what to do next, as well as tips for disposing of the body afterwards. Some other users had suggested that the kidnapper sodomize his victim with something around the house that would be painful, but not kill the victim instantly, so they can have their "fun" for longer, and it seemed like a rolling pin was chosen. I realized that these psychos were sharing photos off the site, because they had references to the photos they had received of the rolling pin being used, and were now egging the kidnapper on to use something wider, like a tin can.

Still, there was a part of me that didn't believe what I was reading, so I clicked on the profile of the kidnapper. In a previous p0st, from six months earlier, he had posted a picture to the murder forum, of a little girl, who was maybe 5 or 6 years old. This little girl, wearing those little kid pajamas, was hanging by the neck inside of his closet at home from a rope, her face was purple and her tongue seemed swollen and it stuck out of her mouth. It was a high quality photo, and it was years before AI generated images were invented.

This was real, and it made me sick to my stomach.

I realized that these psychos operated the same way that pedos must do. They cross paths and recognize each other in different parts of the Dark Web (like chat rooms), and by word of mouth, pass on a site's address where they can congregate and share their interest.

I clicked on the Rape forum, and saw p0sts where users gave advice on which parts of a particular city are best for hunting women at night (like those dark paths leading away from universities, which seemed to be a favorite of theirs for lack of security cameras/passers by, places to hide/escape and young, hot women to target). They were also trading stories of rapes they had done, and congratulating each other. There weren't any pictures or videos p0sted here.

The torture forum had first hand accounts of larger tortures done to kidnapped victims, but also smaller tortures, like putting razor blades in public places, and watching people get hurt from afar. The users were asking for detailed accounts and sharing ideas for new plans. Some of them were juvenile, like one user who shared a story of poisoning his boss' coffee with powerful laxatives and watching him shit his pants at work. Others were way more insidious, like a months-long thread where one user was psychologically torturing a girl at his work with an ultimate goal of making her take her own life. That one was very detailed, and showed a real grasp of psychology, as well as a scary level of patience - and by his account the girl seemed near her breaking point. She was losing her ability to function at work, as well as losing hair from stress.

I noticed that, on the bottom left, there were now "6 users online". A new p0st appeared as a sticky on the moderator's forum. It was a reminder that "new psychopaths had to say hello", or they'd "be banned".

I was still curious, I still wanted to see more and so, to avoid getting banned, I went to the introductions forum and said a quick hello, and then I went to the Evil General forum and asked a Pizzagate related question - something along the lines of "has anyone here come across any groups that mix being evil with the occult, like human sacrifices or something?".

I then checked out the Murder forum, and saw p0sts where psychos were exchanging hints and tips on where and how to dispose of bodies, different methods for killing people, sharing pics of murder victims they claimed to have received privately from the murderers themselves, sharing stories of their own conquests (with incriminating information removed). I also saw another picture of a murdered little girl, from a different user. This one was a "power user" on the board, and it was of a little girl, maybe 8 or 9 years old, with a blue top and tiny shorts. She was also hanging by the neck, from an extension cord, in the corner of an unfinished basement. There were unpainted cinder block walls behind her, and a bare dirt floor, and she was hanging from some pipes above. Her face was swollen, and her skin was pale below the neck, and dark purple above.

Then I noticed that I had received a reply to my p0st, from the same 'power user' who's photo I was looking at. He commented about the occult groups that practice human sacrifice that I was asking about. He said "Cult of the snake. Very dangerous. Stay away from them."

I asked why. he replied instantly, "They kill to keep people quiet, so you can never leave." I didn't know what to ask next, so I went back to the homepage. There were now "12 users online".

At that point I saw that the moderator had made a new sticky thread - in ALL CAPS. The moderator said that there was a huge spike in the number of new accounts, as well as the number of concurrent users, and that he suspected that there had been a leak of the site's address somehow.

Right away - meaning **fucking instantly** upon reading that p0st - I closed Tor and turned my internet off. I felt like I was busted. I didn't know how tech savvy these people were and I didn't want to hang around to find out if they could locate me.

I was reeling. I went for a cigarette to process what had just happened. It had all happened in less than half an hour. After a smoke, though, I calmed down and knew that I had to screenshot everything and send it to the cops. I hadn't thought to do it at the time, because I was just leaping around the website trying to understand it. I logged back on with my clipping tool ready, but the site was down. The mods had already taken it offline. I was only away from my computer for 15 minutes max before I tried reloading EvilBB, but it was gone.

I spent another hour checking "Daniel's List" to see if there was another link for it to get the screenshots, but after that I closed Tor, and didn't open it or download it again until last week.

I still think the Dark Web is going to be a useful asset in the years to come, and that most people will eventually prefer a version of the internet that is genuinely private (because so many have already lost their livelihoods to being canceled), which is why I've gotten back on it. But, damn, EvilBB made me walk away from it for years.

I also stopped caring about or sleuthing Pizzagate that day. I went looking for information on organized groups that hurt kids, and I found them. I can still describe those two little girls in accurate detail, from memory, and I don't want to see any more pictures like that.

So, has anyone here seen EvilBB for themselves? Anyone here know whether the psychos in that community ever faced justice?
