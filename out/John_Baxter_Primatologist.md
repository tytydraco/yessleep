**Note: For the sake of the victims, I'm not going to use real names.**

John Baxter was a primatologist, a guy who studied chimps. He lived with his wife (Anne) and two children (Wilkie and Sam) on Sunbaker Hill, a rich neighbourhood with big lots, nice houses and plenty of privacy.

When the incident happened he was sixty-two years old.

My partner, Jones, and I got called up there one evening on a domestic disturbance.To tell you the truth, we didn't think much of it. On one hand, Sunbaker Hill is a fairly quiet place. On the other, even rich people get into marital spats.

We got out of the car, knocked on the front door (no response) and did a circuit around the perimeter of the house—*when a chimp climbed out of the ground and came screeching at us!*

It looked absolutely rabid.

Jones shot twice, and the chimp dropped a few feet away. It was covered in dark, drying blood. Clearly not its own.

For a few moments it lay there, snarling, revealing long yellowed fangs and sputtering, from twitching violence to the stillness of death.

We knew then this was no ordinary domestic disturbance call.

Approaching the spot from which the chimp had seemingly materialized out of the ground, we saw an opened trap door, with stairs leading somewhere below the level of the perfectly mowed grass.

Standing there, we also heard a faint crying.

We descended.

The stairs led perhaps seventy-five feet underground, then opened onto a long chamber, lit in cold white light like a morgue and lined with cages on both sides. In some of these cages were chimps. Calmly observing us; or going mad with rage, their madness reverberating throughout the chamber. Still other cages had their cage doors open and were empty. We counted those to know how many more chimps might be loose.

In one of the last cages sat a figure, whimpering, its head tucked between shaking knees.

When we announced ourselves, it raised its head—

I cannot even begin to describe how she looked. Jones was visibly repulsed, and I had to fight the urge to look away.

The figure was Anne Baxter.

Except parts of her were missing, and her face had been cut off. She had been *facially scalped*.

“Wilkie…” she croaked between sobs. “Sam.” She resembled speaking raw meat. “Wilkie. Sam. Wilkie. Sam.”

I noticed that as she repeated her children's names she had lifted one of her arms—a section of it missing to the bone—and was pointing up, in the direction of the house.

I understood at once.

I grabbed Jones and pulled him back, and we ran up the stairs, into daylight. We crossed the yard to the house and broke in through a window. The whole time, I could not unsee what remained of Anne Baxter's mangled face.

We were making our way room-to-room in the house when another chimp appeared. This one was much smaller, not nearly as aggressive—and Jones dropped it with a single shot.

As we approached the body, Jones began screaming. And fell to his knees before *what was not a chimp at all but a child in a chimp costume.* Unzipping the costume revealed: Wilkie Baxter.

Dead.

Jones broke down.

He kept checking the boy’s body for signs of life he knew did not exist.

I was about to intervene—when I suddenly heard words coming from behind a pair of double wooden doors leading from ours to an adjacent room.

“Be a good one and eat the meat, Sammy,” a man was saying. “Your mother slaved for it.”

I left Jones and approached.

“I’m not hungry,” a boy said, his weak voice faltering.

“Be a good one. Be a good one and eat your fucking mother's meat!”

I took a deep breath—and entered, repeatedly yelling “Police!” and “Hands where I can see them!” as, pointing my weapon, I surveyed what was evidently a dining room, and where three figures were seated around a table: John Baxter, Sam Baxter and a massive chimp which had its back to me.

Three plates with three meals had been neatly laid out.

“Sam Baxter. Get up from the table and get behind me,” I instructed.

Sam started getting up—then looked over at his father.

“You have my permission,” John Baxter told his son. “But it would be polite also to ask your mother.”

“May I be of any help, officer?” he asked me.

“Stay seated,” I said.

“May I please be excused?” Sam asked.

“Sammy, whom are you addressing?” John Baxter said.

Sam then looked at the massive chimp—Its back was still toward me, its jaws crunching greedily through whatever it was eating.—and said: “May I please be excused, *mother*?”

At that instant the chimp put down its food, slowly turned its monstrous body and rotated its thick neck, until finally I could see its face: Anne Baxter's face: the chimp’s dark eyes staring at me through twin holes in the Anne Baxter flesh-and-skin mask it was wearing and which threatened, at any moment, to slide, bloody, down its face and fall to the hardwood floor.

“Honey,” John Baxter said, “the kind policeman wishes to speak to our son, Sam.”

The chimp snarled.

And I killed it.

Then silence—Sam Baxter crawling from under the table toward me—and John Baxter seated as before, smiling, inserting a fork into a pink cube of meat sitting on the plate in front of him and putting it into his mouth.

“You may arrest me now, officer,” he said after swallowing.

Jones was never the same after that. He quit the police force, then disappeared altogether. Some callous pricks still take bets on whether he's dead or alive.

Anne Baxter was taken to hospital but died by suicide a week later.

John Baxter was charged, convicted and sentenced to life in prison, from where he continues to research and publish.

Sam Baxter will probably be in therapy for the rest of his life.

But what maybe sticks with me most is what John Baxter said after we'd cuffed him, as we were leading him across the yard to the police cruiser. There were about a dozen people there at that point, and they all stared at us as we walked by. “I did it for science,” John Baxter said to them—lecturing them like he would have lectured a classroom full of undergraduates. “And I did it for the wire mother!”

Sometimes I wish I'd killed him [too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
