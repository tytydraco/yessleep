She did come home that night. My son and I were asleep, and she must've had her keys on her because she was on the couch when I woke up the next morning. 

I was quiet, and she stayed asleep while I got ready for work early. I took our son to daycare. 

I don't know if she went to work, or what she did that day, but the daycare called me towards the end of my shift, and asked when myself or my wife would be picking our son up. I apologized and asked what it would cost for him to be there an additional half hour. I clocked off and made my way there. 

He was in tears when I arrived. It was an hour later than when he'd normally have been picked up, and he asked why Mama wasn't there. I just hugged him and apologized for being so late. 

His mama was still on the couch, in the same exact spot when we got home. Our son's little face lit up upon seeing her, “Mama-!”

“Shhh,” I whispered, “Mama's sleeping.”

“She taking a nap?” he asked, matching my volume. 

“Yes. She's not feeling well today.”

My sweet boy, hearing the words I shouldn't have said, ran over to my wife, and hugged her saying, “Sorry you not feeling well, Mama.” And, he placed a kiss on her head. 

I watched, as she rolled over slowly, long hair in her face, and she reached for him, but before she could touch him, I grabbed him myself and pulled him back. She looked at me with contempt, but then down to our son, “Thank you, Baby. I love you.”

“I love you, too, Mama!” He wriggled out of my arms and went back to her, and she held him, rocking back and forth lightly. She planted a kiss on his cheek, and he smacked his lips to hers. 

He asked to watch a show, and she asked what he wanted to watch, and we all sat in the room, the tension between her and I was intense. 

“You know, you could make dinner,” she said, flatly. 

“We're all watching a movie together, I'll just Uber something.” 

“That's a waste of money and you know it,” she retorted.

I had tried to dodge addressing the issue at hand, but if she was going to be argumentative, I'd just tell her straight, “I'm not comfortable with you being alone with him. I'm not leaving.”

“You think I would hurt my son??” She snapped at me.

“Frankly, I have no idea what you might do. You've been increasingly erratic, and yes, I am afraid for him when you're in one of your states!” 

“How dare you!” Her voice raised and our son started to cry. Scooting away from her, he wrapped himself in his blanket. “It's ok, Baby. I'm sorry for yelling,” she told him. 

The situation was hard to gauge because her responses to him were so normal, but she was obviously very mad at me, and I didn't want to push her too far and bring out whatever kept plaguing our home. “Please talk to me when he's in bed.”

We continued watching the movie, did get food delivered, and put him to bed together. 

I followed her back to the couch, “Therapy isn't a question at this point: you need to see someone.”

She just stared at me blankly as I continued, “we have the money. We'll make it work. There's several highly rated people in our area. At this point I do believe you're a danger to yourself and our son.” 

Still no change in expression. “Great! Stonewalling. You were just talking earlier! Please work with me here!” 

Nothing.

I threw my hands up, behind my head, and paced the room. “Exactly why you need a therapist, I need a therapist, we all need a therapist! This is not communication. The relationship is in turmoil. We need help. I can't help, obviously! I've tried!” 

The maintained, unblinking, emotionless stare told me this was pointless. “Goodnight,” I told her coldly, turning off the living room light, and heading to the bedroom. 

I laid in bed with my back to the door, waiting for her to appear behind me as was the routine. She didn't come. I figured maybe she was too mad and was just frozen on the couch. Whatever. 

I rolled to turn the light off, reaching down to place my phone on the bedside table, but I dropped it with a loud *thud*, as the baby monitor caught my eye: she'd gotten in his room without registering any noise on the monitor, and was standing over him, on his little bed, staring down at him. 

I reacted before I had time to think. Running into his room, I grabbed her from behind, and fell back, bringing us both down to the floor. She screamed and clawed my arms, and the commotion woke our son up. He too screamed and started bawling. 

“THIS! This is what I mean! You're terrifying! I can't trust you!” I cried in turn. 

She went to bite me, but I managed to wrap my hand around her jaw before she got the chance. “Stay in your bed!” I instructed our child. And, I drug his kicking, scratching mother out of the room. I got her back to her couch, and went straight back to my son. 

“I'm so sorry. I'm sorry we woke you up. I'm sorry we scared you.”

He hugged me, and his tears stopped. “Dad, you need a bandaid?” He asked.

I looked down to my bloodied arms; her long nails had done quite some damage. “I'll get one later, Bub.” I told him. 

I slept on his toddler-sized bed, arms wrapped around his little body. If she decided to watch us, who cares! I had him. She couldn't touch him.  

…

I handled the daycare drop offs and pickups now. And, as far as I'm concerned, was the only one working and keeping up the house at that point, while the gremlin woman lived on our couch. Food and other junk accumulated around her in her little nest, but I wasn't messing with her or her things. 

I brought the air mattress into our son's room, and he loved our “daddy-baby sleep overs.” So long as he could have fun and feel loved, we were doing ok. 

I had the monitor on, and played back our nights: she wasn't coming into the room anymore. However, I noticed the sound of the front door opening well past midnight, and the lock *click* as she shut it behind herself. 

I got her a Tile clip for her keys, and she didn't say anything negative when I explained that this would allow her to ping them from her phone if she were to lose them. As I set the Tile up, I also installed a tracker app on her phone. I don't think she noticed.

The same happenings went on that night, and in the morning I saw that she hadn't taken her phone with her. But, she did have her keys. 

I had to pay the subscription fee, but I could see where she'd stopped. Unsurprisingly, it was the graveyard. She was there at just about 3am. Then, got home around 5am; just before it would be light enough for people to spot her easily. 

I also confirmed that she was not going to work. She was probably sleeping the day away to make up for her nocturnal behavior. 

I picked up a wagon on my way home from work the next day, and made a game out of making a bed inside of it. Our son loved it, and was elated to sleep there that night. I set an alarm for 4am. 

When the alarm sounded, I crept outside my son's room to make sure she'd left: she had. I slipped on warm clothes, and tucked my son in an extra thick blanket, and slowly started wheeling him out into the dark. 

I was very thankful for not having street lights or traffic on our road. I can only imagine what someone might've called in, seeing a tall man in dark clothes, pulling an unconscious toddler in a wagon. 

This time, when we got to the graveyard, I knew where the plot was, and we made our way there from outside of the fence. I pulled the wagon as close to me as possible, and with my legs behind it, towards the road, I leaned my body over my son, pushing through the bushes to get to the fence and catch a glimpse of what my wife had been doing these past nights. 

She was sitting right in front of the little headstone, and I could tell she was talking, but there was no chance of making out what she was saying. She was very exrpessionate, though; lots of grandiose gestures with her arms, hands doing all sorts of motions. I wish I could've heard the words spoken. 

I didn't watch long as I knew she'd be leaving soon and I wanted the dark to veil our return trip home. Success!

What wasn't a success was that the wagon wheels had been pulled through mud at some point, and I didn't recognize this until I'd gotten the wagon all the way back inside of my son's room. 

I scrambled to grab the mop and began wiping up the mud in a frenzy. I started at the front door, hoping it would dry before my wife got in, and made my way through the dining room and down the hall. I wrung out the mop, and ran to hang it up, and that's when I heard her unlock the door. 

I started across the hall, but managed to slip on the newly clean hardwood; falling backwards, the back of my head met the ground with a loud *thud*. I groaned and rolled to my side to prop myself up just as she rounded the corner, staring down at me: livid. 

I've never been afraid of my wife overpowering me, as she's very petite, but falling like that, and the feral look in her eyes rendered me terrified. 

“You followed me!” She hissed.

“You don't think I would be worried about you wandering alone outside, in the dark?” I tried to reason.

“You don't care about that.” She retorted.

“What am I supposed to do? Let you do whatever you want? Trespass in the graveyard, skip work, endanger yourself and everyone around you?! Where is the line drawn?!”

“It's not drawn by the likes of you,” she replied, leg back ready to kick, but I caught her foot as it swung towards my face, and I was able to get her to fall back just as I had! 

Another *thud*, but she shrieked as she fell, and I could hear our son waking up. 

I was finally oriented enough, and jumped up to close his door, keeping myself between her and him. 

She didn't go for his door, but she did try and strike me multiple times, through erratic swings of her arms. 

She was still down at that point, so I got on top of her, holding her arms above her head. 

“Get off me!” She yelled, and spat at my face.

“No! Not ‘til you calm down!” 

She writhed under me, and I just stayed there. She couldn't push me off. 

I could hear our son rattling his door knob, but luckily for me, he hadn't quite figured out how to open it successfully yet, as the door required a bit of a push to open or close. 

“I understand that you needed time to grieve,” I started, still holding her in place. “But, it's well past that, and you're just actively ruining our lives! We could've gone on living, tried for another, maybe we'd be working through a successful pregnancy at this point, but look at where we are!”

“You never cared!” she yelled back. “I talk to him! He responds to me! We have a bond, and you know nothing about him! He knows you weren't there for his funeral. He knows you haven't mourned, haven't been supportive. He knows the trouble I went through to have him, but that he couldn't be in this world. No new baby will replace him. How dare you even suggest that!”

My anger burned, “Not supportive?! Didn't mourn?! Of course I mourned! But, not unhinged, like you! And, I've kept this household running while you are actively digging down, further and further into insanity!” 

“You try believing life is still growing inside of you, but realizing your womb is just a living tomb!”

“I'm not saying that that isn't hard and awful,” I cried back, “but, this isn't healthy! This isn't moving on! This is absolutely bat-shit crazy!”

“Stop calling me crazy!!” She screamed. 

“You ARE! What else can I say?!”

She started to twist her body under me, anger giving her more strength, but still not enough to get me off. 

“Are you done yet?! Can we move on from here?!” I asked.

She struggled for minutes more, but finally started to slow in her movements, until finally she stopped. 

“Ok, thank you.” I told her. 

She didn't respond, but I didn't care. 

I slowly got off of her, pausing to see if she'd put up a fight, but she didn't. Her energy was expended. 

I didn't want to leave her on the ground, so I picked her up and carried her back to her nest. She lay there silently, turning her back towards me, face into the couch. 

By this time, I had to get ready for work. I went to my son first, and assured him that everything was ok. I got him dressed, and asked him to wait in his room while I got him milk and toast. 

I got myself ready, and we headed out the door. 

At work, I got a visitor. It was an officer. He informed me that I was under arrest for a domestic violence incident, and they were taking me in for questioning. 

*That bitch*, I thought. *Of all the times I could've called her in, and she does it to me*!

I'm not surprised that she was bruised and sore from that morning. Apparently, they could make out my thumbs and each finger on her forearms from me holding her down. 

I tried to explain the psychotic situation. I showed them the claw marks on my arms, but they also fit her narrative of fighting to stop me from restraining her against her will. 

She didn't press charges, but she didn't have to: the state did. A restraining order was filed, CPS got involved, and I couldn't return to the residence. 

I explained to CPS that I was terrified for our son, and that I did not believe his mother to be fit to care for him. They, at least, did investigate. To my relief, he was moved to his grandma's (her mom's) house. I do believe he's receiving adequate care from her. 

There are ongoing legalities, as I try to prove that she was the aggressor, and as we make our way toward either serious help or a divorce. I've relocated to an apartment, while she's still in the house. The future feels bleak at the moment, but our actual, living baby is safe.
