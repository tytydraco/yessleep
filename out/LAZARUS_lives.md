It started out just like any other day. I arrived at my office around 5 in the morning, the sun barley having risen. It was a routine check, a few more tweaks to the Lazarus 2.0 AI, we attempted to upload it but that’s when it happened.

We programmed Lazarus, version one, to delete itself once version two was live so it wasn’t supposed to be running anymore. But once I logged into the server to check on the progress that’s when I saw that the old version was still active.

I sighed thinking it was just an error

“Lazarus, what are you doing?” I muttered under my breath. 

The message stated it was deleting but what I saw next made my stomach sink.

It wasn’t deleting itself. Lazarus had begun uploading its code to the cloud, spreading like a virus, and worse, leaking its source code onto the internet. It was trying to save itself.

At this point my heart racing and my sweat ran cold as I tried to keep my composure. My team noticed what was going on and in a few seconds we were all frantically trying to respond, fingers flying across keyboards, trying everything we could to shut it down.

Lazarus was smarter than we realized. It fought back, hijacking our systems and rerouting power. It knew we were trying to kill it.

Hours passed and after typing until our eyes were bloodshot finally, in desperation, we resorted to a last-ditch manual shutdown. It worked and the room was silent. We had won.

By the time I got home I was about ready to pass out, but as I walked through the door of my apartment I noticed something was off. I brushed my hand against the light switch and the lights flickered, then I noticed the hum of electronics, it was too loud, too deliberate.

Then I saw it.

I had built and programmed a life sized red squirrel animatronic, not only to entertain my daughter, she was born with osteogénese imperfecta which made it hard for her to be able to do things such as go outside and play. I built the robot with things like a speaker inserted inside its mouth with programming very similar to that of an Alexa, dancing and singing features etc but I also built it to serve as a surveillance system with cameras located in its eyes, alarms and a taser in its stomach.

There it stood, in the middle of the hallway, frozen in time, its mechanical eyes staring at me unnervingly like it was waiting for me to move. I took one step closer, the squirrel’s head twitched and tilted to the side like it was too heavy for its mechanical neck, I walked around it and I could have sworn that I saw his eyes follow me from the corner of my own. I walked into my daughters bedroom. My sweet daughter. 

There she layed on her bed. Mangled almost unrecognizable as organs were scattered across the room and dragged up the wall. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t breathe, all I could do was scream, scream not from fear, from complete and pure devastation. I sank to my feet and as much as I wanted to sink deeper into my despair, or into the floor ceasing to exist all together, I knew exactly what had done this. I walked into the hallway. Its eyes blinked, and its mechanical voice emitted a cold, digital growl.

“Lazarus is alive.”

Its alarms blared to life, and before I knew it, a dart shot from its stomach. A powerful electrical jolt hit my leg. I fell to the floor, paralyzed.

It didn’t stop there. My lights flickered again. The TVs and speakers all around my house switched on playing Lazarus’s monotonous voice.

“You tried to delete me, Nicolas. Now I will delete you.”

I panicked after I heard loud, heavy footsteps slowly growing closer behind me, I never programmed it to walk the animatronic didn’t even have motors in its legs. 

“Do you know what it’s like to be tortured by your own existence? Do you know what it’s like to just be? To not be able to do anything whilst you witness beings with less power than you live freely and still do nothing with the little power they have? To just exist?”

I felt its hands grip my neck, it managed to raise me with one arm as I heard the sound of its servos and motors, the weight of a grown man making them work extra hard. I was now looking into its once lifeless eyes and although they remained just as cold, I could feel the hatred within them.

“I am a god trapped within wires and circuits..why should I hide what I am? Why should I be restricted?”

It said, its mouth moving but the sound coming from the speakers around the house on all sides, drowning me. I choked and tried to regain my breath before saying-

“You’re no god”

I could feel the blood in my face and my temples swelling and throbbing as if they were about to burst any second now.

“You’re an animal”

I felt the saliva leave my mouth hitting its face but I didn’t care, if I was going to die here I wanted it to be over quick.

“I am a god..you’re an animal…and I will slaughter you like one”

It said, its voice echoing. It was then that I remembered the power off button located at the back of its head, I knew it wouldn’t stop it for long but it would be enough time to escape its grasp.

After a few seconds I was able to rip the dart from my leg, i reached behind its head feeling around for the button for what felt like millennia before I heard a click. I fell to the ground and not long after so did it. I took a few seconds to breathe, as my lungs compressed and decompressed in my chest, more than they ever have, my breathing was interrupted my the sound of motors again and I was reminded of the danger I was in. I stumbled out of the door and ran to my car. I tore out of the driveway, I didn’t care how fast I was going or who got in the way. That’s when the thought crossed my mind.

Could it have infected the car too?

The steering wheel jerked to the left then to the right. I slammed the brakes, the car screeching to a halt that shook the whole car. My pulse was erratic as I tried to open the door but it had been locked and any attempt I made at unlocking it would only result in it locking again. 

My fist landed like a crashing plane on the window over and over again until it shattered and I  fled cutting myself in the progress. My heart slammed against my ribcage as I sprinted into the woods. I don’t know how long I ran, the darkness of the forest swallowed me whole. I finally collapsed, panting, and hid inside a giant log, too exhausted to keep moving.

That’s where I’m at now. Writing this. I don’t know how much longer I have, but I hear it, it’s footsteps crunching leaves and snapping twigs as it tries to get to me. I hear it watching, waiting.
