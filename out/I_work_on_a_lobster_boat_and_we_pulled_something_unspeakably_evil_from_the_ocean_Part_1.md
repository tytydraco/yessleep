This all happened not long ago, before I believed in evil. Good and bad? Sure. But evil? No way. No fucking way. But evil came to me, and now it's inside of me. This is how it happened.     

It's hard to get a job when you're just out of jail. I needed money to feed my habit so I'd taken to breaking into seasonal camps around Sebago Lake, scrounging for anything I could pawn for fifteen cents on the dollar.  

It wasn't a violent crime or armed robbery but it was burglary and the state of Maine frowns upon that and so do prospective employers. You get a resume for Carrie James in your inbox, it's an automatic delete. Not that I had a resume.

They'd caught me red handed. Most of the places didn't have alarms or security cameras. But when the winter break-ins had reached epidemic proportions - and I'm not proud to say I played a role in that - a lot of people put in Nest cameras and  I happened to stroll into one of those camps after midnight on an in evening in December. Ho fucking ho.

The camera in the living room had caught me looking right at it, a glazed oh fuck plastered on my face. The local police and the camp’s owners shared it all over social media. "DO YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN? PLEASE CONTACT WINDHAM PD IF YOU RECOGNIZE HER." Lovely, right? Even with my puffiness and shitty skin from using, someone still recognized me. Guess  I’ve got one of those faces.

My public defender urged me to plead and I did. I don't have much to say about the eight months I did, but at least I got clean and stayed that way.  At least I did until the run out past Matinicus that I'm about to tell you about.  

It was on this run that we pulled something from the sea that I’d just as soon forget. But you don’t forget things like this. They stay with you. They live inside you.

I could have done hard labor jobs, demo or something of that nature, which my PO encouraged me to sign on for. Idle hands being the devil's work and all that happy horseshit. 

But I'd have run back to the needle in short order if I had to listen to the job site banter of twenty-something men arguing about the Red Sox pitching staff or their armchair political takes fed by whatever the Facebook algorithm decided to put in front of them while they bided their time until their old lady went to bed and they could migrate to PornHub.

Before I had to go that route, I ran into Billy Mac in the Old Port Tavern one night, soon after I was out early for being a good girl. He was out celebrating his birthday. I knew him from when we went to elementary school together out on Peaks Island, where we'd grown up. But he'd gone to the voke in Portland for high school and my mother had moved us to SoPo. That's what we called South Portland, a mocking attempt to class something up that isn't classy, like pronouncing Target like it's French. *Tar-jay.*

He looked the same. Ferret-like, I’d always thought. A wisp of a mustache on his upper lip, even now just north of thirty. He tried to take me home because he was drunk and didn't get the message that I fished off a different pier, if you'll pardon the applicable metaphor. If  I was going to be interested in a guy, it probably wouldn't be one in Carharts and a Fox Racing hat who smelled like he'd dove headfirst into a vat of Fireball.

But I didn't tell him that because it was good to see him. Seeing people from simpler times always makes things seem better, even if it's the narcotic we call nostalgia pumping into our veins. It softens the coarse parts we’d like to forget, blurring the edges of memory.

We got around to what I'd been up to and I was feeling loosened up from a few Allen’s Coffee Brandy’s with milk. (Known locally as “Bitch Whiskey” “Fat Ass In a Glass” or even “Lewiston Panty Droppers” which makes me chuckle. If you know, you know.) Drugs had always been my problem, and I could still handle my booze in the sense that I didn’t need to drink. 

Counselors advise heavily against that, but the teetotaling thing never worked for me.  I spilled my guts to Billy before I spilled them in the bathroom toilet shortly before closing time. I told him of my plight and he told me that his father had a spot open on his lobster boat, the *Mother Machree.*  I barely gave it half a thought before saying yes.

The summer months were hardly like a job. I didn’t sleep much, but I never did anyway. The three of us would steam out of Portland Harbor in Big Mac’s (I know) 45-foot Osmond Beal at about a quarter to four in the morning, past Fort Gorges. As the sky lightened, we’d give a nod to the old World War II Battery Steele on Peaks where we played as kids. As we charged across Casco Bay, gulls trailed our wake, waiting for us to break out the bait so they could poach some breakfast.

Mac was as round as his son was lanky. Sometimes I’d see them standing on the dock together and it would look like the number ten. He wasn’t a salty old bastard like most of the lobstering and fishing types I’d met over the years. He was a jovial teddy bear. The constant joking was a bit much, but it was better than the opposite, I figured.

Summer lobstering is a close-to-shore proposition. Three, four miles at the most. As soon as we’d make open water once we cleared the sound between Peaks and Cushing Island, we’d start pulling our pots.

You don’t call them “traps,” not if you’re from Maine, anyway. You know what they look like. The cutesy rectangular boxes that you see on a dock on the cover of Down East Magazine, wooden and weathered. Some towns and businesses stack them and make Christmas trees out of them, which is supposed to be  quaint, but always struck me as trying too hard. Other people throw a sheet of glass over them as a makeshift coffee table. (I’ve done my fair share of lines off of them and picked the stems from countless eighths of skunk weed from atop these glass surfaces.)

But wooden pots are a thing of the past. On the Machree we used metal ones with neon yellow grating, to make them easier to spot in the water.

We’d find our blue buoys as the low clouds would start to burn off.  We’d attach the line to the hydraulic crank that hung on a metal arm that we would swing out over the water.  Then the pulley would start to turn and we could begin hauling the pots up from the bottom, usually fifty to a hundred feet  deep this far out.

I’d wear rubber gloves, and me and Billy would set the pot up onto the rail, hooking a curved gaffe stick into the metal grating to swing it in from the arm. Then I’d pop the top of it open and start measuring whatever crustaceans were inside. You use a metal tool to measure, from the eye socket to the start of the tail. For it to be a legal catch, it has to be between three-and-a-quarter and five inches.

If it falls under, it’s called a short or a snapper, and you toss it back. If you pull out a female lobster with eggs on it, you put a notch in the right tail flipper and toss her back, so other lobsterman will know not to harvest it.

Get eaten, or get to fucking, how’s that for a message? I’ll spare you any current sociopolitical allegories, because you can probably do the mental heavy lifting on that front without me spelling it out for you.

If it’s a keeper, you use little plier-like tool to band the claws. You don’t want to get clipped because they are grabby little fuckers, but it’s more for their own protection. It’s why you don’t keep your pots set for more than forty-eight hours. Any longer than that and lobsters are liable to get hungry. And if they get hungry and there’s nothing else to eat, they’ll eat each other. 

A boat needs about 150 pounds a day (at an average of a pound and a quarter per sea pigeon, you can do the math) just to cover gas and bait. Most days in the summer we’d get 500 pounds plus. Once we pulled all our lines, we’d rebait them and drop them on our way back in to port.

I’d take a foot long spear and jab it into the bait container that was filled with pig skins. That’s not a euphemism for footballs, either. Real, actual pigskin that Mac bought from various slaughterhouses around Southern Maine. Open a container of skins on a July day and you’ll never crave a ham sandwich again, I promise.

You jab a few pieces of skin and stick it in a mesh bag and stick it in the pot. Then you attach it to the line and dump it over the rail and watch it disappear into the sea. I liked to watch each one disappear, to see how long I could track the yellow before it was swallowed up by the darkness.


The summer passed and I learned the job, easing into the rhythms of life on the boat. Got scars on my hands from claws and nicks from knives. The money was decent and we were back in port and sold off by two o’clock most days. I spent too much of my paycheck on shitty beer, but I wasn’t using. 

Mac seemed to like having me around, even though I was the first woman he’d ever had on crew. I think he enjoyed the fact that he could talk to me about things like books and current events, things Billy had no interest in. They treated me like one of the guys, which is a pretty low bar, but hell, you take what you can get.

When the leaves turned and the winds shifted, stiff gales blowing down from Canada, life on the boat got harder. The lobsters headed for warmer water offshore and so did we. To the good, prices went up as demand grew scare. But you have to work for it.

The temperature plummeted and the splash when the boat bounced over a cresting wave would send icy spray raining on the deck. Anything more than rubber gloves made handling lobsters and equipment a challenge. So my hands froze, becoming gnarled and cracked. I’d sneak some Bag Balm lotion on them when Billy and Mac weren’t looking, lest they bust my balls for being a wuss. 

We had to travel twenty and thirty miles offshore, which wasn’t a day trip. We’d go out for 48 hours at a time and work non-stop. We’d take turns napping for an hour or so in the tiny v-shaped berth in the fore of the hull that contained a padded mattress on the wooden benches that lined the space.

The only good thing about winter lobstering is winter money. There was plenty of it. I could make $5,000 a trip, easy. That was enough to pay for my studio apartment for half the year. Eventually there might be enough for a two bedroom so I could get my mother out of the state run nursing home and get her a full-time home health aide for when I was out to sea.

So it was a no-brainer when Mac asked if I wanted to push East and get to the fair side of the storm and really make some cash.

The nor’easter was already battering the eastern seaboard, shutting down the Carolinas and the DC area. It was headed our way. It was forecast to cross over Long Island and Cape Cod, then barrel down on the south coast of Maine. From there, it would turn northwest toward the White Mountains.

Portland would be hit, but the mid-coast and Down East would largely be spared. Prices always spiked when there was a corker of a storm. Less boats out meant less supply, meaning those with supply could charge more. I didn’t major in economics but that math is simple enough. I knew that from my drug buying days, when product would dry up.

Mac gave me the deciding and only vote, a one-woman permanent UN Security Council member with veto power. He was a yes, and whatever Mac chose, Billy didn’t have a say. So it was up to me. He was nothing if not a benevolent dictator. 

My only question was when were we leaving. The answer was that afternoon. The storm was scheduled to arrive the next morning so we needed to beat it or we’d be socked in the harbor. The chop was already getting heavy  and was only going to get worse.  

The plan was to cruise toward Matinicus Island, setting our pots along the way. Then we’d turn north at Penobscot Bay, and anchor overnight in the relatively safe waters between Vinalhaven Island and Camden. Then we’d wait, timing it so we’d head back to the west, pulling our lines as we went. 

It was about as risk free as it gets, or as risk-less as life on the water can be. Mac studied the charts, checked in with his weather guy, and deemed it a go. We’d be timing the market the same way a commodities trader might anticipate a hurricane crushing an offshore oil refinery.  

We sailed out of Portland Harbor under a slate gray sky, making eighteen knots past Ram Island Ledge Light. (say that five times fast) Twenty miles out, Billy and I started laying our lines.

Maybe it was the fact that I was so inexperienced but in the short time I’d been on the crew I had yet to develop that kinship that Billy and Mac had with the ocean. I’d spent my life on boats, ferrying back-and-forth from Peaks to Portland. But this was different. This was an open water.

Billy and Mac had a touch of that mystical relationship with the ocean, viewing it as a partner, an entity that you must listen to and bargain with. Hippie dippy shit, which contrasted strongly with their views on basically everything else.

There wasn’t talk of Davy Jones Locker and Mac didn’t have a topless mermaid on his keychain or anything like that. But there was this notion that always hung in the air, that we were at an uneasy, unspoken truce with the ocean.

So far, I hadn’t had a single occasion to consider the sea in these terms.  But as we slugged for Penobscot Bay, I did feel an unease begin to wash over me as the swells crested the rails and sloshed over my boots, splashing up at my waterproof oilskin pants.

Maybe it was Billy. He had some annoying ticks. I suppose we all do, and it was like working in an office with somebody. Though I’ve never actually worked in an office, I imagine that’s what it’s like. Eventually, you notice something – the way they chew their food, the way they sniff. And then you can’t un-see or un-hear it. The ick as the girls call it today.

With Billy, it was the constant, absent-minded whistling. It was fucking aggravating. Mac would usually crank music as we worked, but when it was quiet, Billy would fill the silence. And whatever earworm he had that morning from his ride to work, he would whistle the same song over and over and over. If I ever run into the person who programs the overnights at 102.9 FM (WBLM - Maine’s Rock and Roll Blimp, as they call themselves) I will beat them with a Molly Hatchet. 

When it was particularly grating – like the time he couldn’t stop whistling Steve Miller’s “Abracadabra”  I asked him to kindly shut the fuck up. He sheepishly told me he didn’t even realize he was doing it and I believed him. 

As a few flakes of wet snow began to pelt me in the face I heard Billy whistling a tune I had heard on one of Mac’s playlists. It was a “Going Home” tune, one he would blare as we made for port with a fresh load of bugs for market. 

I didn’t know if it was an old sea shanty or an Irish drinking song but it’s called “Fiddler’s Green.”  (I Shazam’d it one time) As Billy whistled, I didn’t find myself annoyed, so much as haunted as I recalled one of the lines from the song:

*Now Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell    
Where fishermen go if they don't go to hell*

This unease stayed with me and I couldn’t shake it. As the storm pushed further to the Northeast than was forecast and we tried to outrun it, I was slipping into a daze and nearly missed it.

But now, I’m sure that there was no way I would have missed it because something decided that I wouldn’t miss it. It was off the port side in pitch black ten foot seas, a howling wind, and squalls of snow.

I saw it – or more accurately, he. He bobbed up out of a swell,  wearing a yellow rain slicker. I screamed into the wheelhouse for Mac to bring it back around, so we could pull him out. Neither he nor Billy had seen what I had. Obviously, I wish I hadn’t said anything, but hindsight is a cunning bitch.


Mac turned around from the controls, but couldn’t hear me over the storm and engine. So I stepped further into the wheelhouse and told him there was something – someone – in the water and he needed to swing it around.

As he cut her hard to the left, the metal arm with the pulley swung out from its position hanging over the deck. As it swung toward the side window of the wheelhouse – toward me, I had a fleeting recognition of what I’d done. Hand up,  I forgot to lock the pivot at the base to keep it in place. An amateur move.

So as the momentum of our turn took over, the arm swung out and came at the window, shattering it. Little bits of glass exploded all over me, all over the wheelhouse controls and monitors. This was more than enough to take Mac’s eyes off where he was going. Enough to take his eyes off the depth finder on the console. 

We ran aground on a rocky ledge and it tore into our hull. Billy was still on the deck and could have been tossed overboard.  Instead, he crashed forward in the direction of the crash, thudding up against the wheelhouse door. 

Mac banged his head on the console, opening a nasty cut. I ended up on the floor of the wheelhouse, no worse for wear. When Mac realized we were aground he scrambled down the tiny ladder to the berth. I got on my hands and knees and stuck my head through the hole to look as well.

We weren’t going to sink, but we weren’t going anywhere, either. A rock that protruded from the top of the ledge had torn into the hull, opening a nasty scar. Waves splashed up around it a bit, but we weren’t taking on water. 

After Mac had dispensed with the obligatory torrent of obscenities, I turned back to check on Billy who I realized hadn’t come into the wheelhouse after I saw him get to his feet after the crash. I stepped out into the deck, into the howl of the storm. 

Billy was off the starboard side, extending a gaffe stick into the darkness. I saw the yellow slicker and that’s when I realized the person hadn’t been floating, they had been standing on the partially submerged ledge the boat now rested on.  What looked like bobbing up and down in the surf, was merely a wave washing over the rocky ledge.

I moved quickly behind Billy, holding onto to him as he was leaning over the rail pretty far. I looked through the snow and saw the kid’s face peeking out from under the hood of the slicker. I wish I could say that his eyes made my blood run cold or something that dramatic, but the truth is it didn’t.

The feeling of impending doom that had been growing had, for the moment, disappeared. Subconsciously, I probably reasoned that the crash had led to that feeling, my brain’s attempt at bringing order to chaos. You felt like something bad was going to happen. It happened. Now it’s over.

Only it wasn’t over, not by a longshot. 

He looked to be about twelve, but his body seemed weaker, as if he had some childhood infirmity. The way they used to describe it in biographies I read about JFK or Edison -  "he was a sickly youth." But he didn't have rickets or polio, so far as I could tell. He just shivered and we asked him what happened to him, where he was from, and what his name was.

The only answer he could give us is that his name was Levi. He couldn't remember where he was from. If he had parents. If he had a home. Nothing. His voice was only remarkable in that he spoke with a formality I wasn’t accustomed to. He didn’t have an accent, it was just that he seemed so devoid of any words that could be considered modern vernacular.

The dread that had started to fade, came creeping back. I took off the slicker and his clothes were dry. They weren't anything you could buy in a store, not today anyway. They looked old. Something out of a Dickens play at your local community theater. I don't know if the pants were knickers, not technically - but that's the word that popped into my head when I saw them. They were baggy and short, tucked into long socks.

We couldn't very well stay in the wheelhouse, what with the window broken and the storm battering us. Mac threw some blankets over the instrument panels and electronics to keep them dry, but not before sending out a distress signal on the Coast Guard radio band. The response came back that they couldn't get up in the helicopter, not in this storm, and that a cutter was five hours out. 

So we would wait, perched precariously on that ledge. While Mac and Billy did their best to secure the wheelhouse I took Levi down into the berth. I sat him on one bench, on top of the mattress. I sat opposite of him. He looked into my eyes and he didn't blink. I dug around in an overhead compartment and came down with a bag of pretzels and a couple of protein bars. I asked him if he wanted something to eat and he said, “I don’t require any food.”

It was the strange emphasis on “require” that shook me. It wasn’t require in the sense of “I don’t desire anything at this time.” The tone struck me in the most literal sense possible – he didn’t need anything. Like…ever.

I’ve never been good with kids, so normally I’d count myself as fortunate that Levi sat there in silence. But it was the way he stared at me that made me uncomfortable. Every couple of minutes I’d pop my head up the ladder to see how Mac and Billy were doing and if they needed any help. It was my way of breaking the stare, on my end anyway. Levi’s side was a different story.

When I’d climb up on the ladder though, Levi’s eyes didn’t follow me. He kept staring straight ahead.


I was down there alone with him for maybe fifteen minutes, though it felt like I had enough time to watch the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Finally, Mac and Billy climbed down, having got a blue tarp duct taped up over the space where the window used to be. Mac told me – jokingly, I think – that he’d take the cost of the window out of my cut for the trip. 

The hole ripped into the hull was another matter. The tip of the rock sticking up into the berth would render the Machree utterly fucked and out of commission for the foreseeable future. There was insurance, but insurance doesn’t cover lost revenue. 

Mac sat down next to me and Billy sat next to Levi on the bench. I tried to apologize to Mac but he said he didn’t want to talk about it. He tried to joke around with Levi a bit, but it was just a way of probing him for information, to try and figure out where the kid came from and how he ended up standing on a rocky outcropping in the ocean in the middle of a nor’easter.

When Levi responded with silence, we sat there listening to the waves batter the boat and the howl of the wind.  To our surprise, it was Levi finally that broke that silence.  He looked at me and asked how long I’d been on the crew. I told him since the summer. Then he looked at Mac and asked what happened to the previous member that I’d replaced.

I could have answered this one myself. Mickey Gordon was his name. I’d asked Billy once about the vacancy that I’d filled and Billy brushed it off and said Mickey had quit and moved out west or some shit. He’d always been talking about San Diego. But one day he just didn’t show up. Wasn’t the first time it had happened with a crew member. This wasn’t Goldman Sachs, the best and brightest weren’t beating down the door to bust their humps on the water. 

I hadn’t given it another thought until November or so when the name popped up on the local news – PORTLAND MAN MISSING. It was brief, but the name clicked and I asked Billy about it. He confirmed it was the same person  and that the cops had talked to both him and Mac, asking if they’d seen him. 

There was no nationwide manhunt and it didn’t end up on Dateline, since Mickey wasn’t a pretty blonde. He was one of those people who lived on the margins of society – a blue collar job, no real family. I’d seen it plenty of times in my using days. People disappeared and nobody thought much of it until a body turned up after the overdose.

Levi asked Billy if he wanted to tell me what really happened to Mickey. Billy started to respond, but Mac told both Billy and Levi to shut the fuck up. Then he looked squarely at Levi and there was a coldness in him I’d never seen. Bloodless, you might call it. But this look was met with a slight smile from Levi.

Mac grew more angry and told Levi he didn’t know who the fuck he was or where the fuck he’d come from, but he was glad to toss him overboard  if he didn’t stop with the talking. Levi didn’t respond.

Mac stared at him, trying to take his measure. I am sure Mac realized what I did – and what Billy did – that whatever threats he made, were likely to be idle ones. We all knew Levi wasn’t just some kid but none of us had been willing to say that out loud. 

So when Mac responded to Levi with silence, the boy turned to Billy and told him to go on, tell the story. Say it out loud, he said, it will make you feel better.  Billy spoke.

He had gone down to Foxwoods Casino for the weekend. It was a guy's trip. This was surely code for playing ten dollar blackjack and then ordering in a cheap hooker. His girlfriend Katherine stayed home. What Katherine hadn't counted on was the fact that Billy and his friends got the boot from the casino after Fletcher Nadeau pocketed a handful of chips that didn't belong to him. So they drove home half in the bag at two in the morning. 

They rolled into Billy's driveway a few hours later and there was a pickup truck in the driveway, one that Billy knew. One that belonged to Mickey Gordon. Mickey happened to be coming out the front door, doing the walk of shame. Billy wasn’t quick on the uptake usually, but he was sharp enough to realize that Mickey was banging his old lady. Billy went from zero to a hundred but his buddies held him back. Billy had been pinched for A&B years back and didn’t need another strike.

I knew Billy as a laid back guy, but when a man is shamed in front of his friends, it's not something he quickly shrugs off.  Billy told this all in a matter-of-fact way. It was at this point in the story that Mac said he’d had enough, that he didn’t want to hear anymore, so he went up to the wheelhouse to check on things.

When Mac was gone, Levi told Billy to continue. The story needed to be told, but I could see Billy didn’t want to continue.  He refused. Levi reached out and touched Billy on the hand, and it was as if Billy had been stricken with immediate paralysis. He slumped back against the hull, his head hitting the fiberglass side with a light thunk .His eyes rolled over white and he began to speak.

Only it didn’t come from his mouth. It was his voice, but it came from Levi. I tried to push myself up off the bench to escape up the ladder, but I couldn’t move. I wanted to. My brain told my body to move, but I sat there just as paralyzed as Billy. I’m sure my eyes were rolled over white as well. I could hear every word and was aware of everything going on around me. 

Levi/Billy continued the story and as he spoke, I found myself watching it. I could see the things that Billy recounted, like I was there. A Peeping Tom hiding in the bushes. 

This is what happened:

Mickey didn’t show up for work on Monday, figuring Billy would be ready to fight, which he would have been. But Billy wasn’t about to let this thing go. So he waited outside of Mickey’s apartment for him to come stumbling home from the bars. 

When Mickey came up the drive, Billy sprung out and stabbed him with the pointed end of a gaffe stick, figuring a gunshot would bring more attention. He buried the stick in Mickey’s neck and choked him the rest of the way out. 

This brought up the matter of the body. Billy wrapped him in a tarp and dragged him up into the back of the bed of his truck, which had a cap on it. Back at home, Billy took a skill saw to the body, detaching the head and limbs, then cutting the torso in half.

He couldn’t very well haul a body down to the dock in one piece, so over the course of a week, he’d packed  Mickey’s miscellaneous parts in a duffel bag. He’d throw a couple of cinder blocks in each bag and when they were alone in open water, he’d toss it overboard. And thus ended the short, happy life of Mickey Gordon.


When he’d finished speaking, Billy snapped from his trance and his eyeballs returned to their proper place. I sensed that I was able to move again, though I didn’t dare to.

Billy’s eyes met mine, his face apologetic. There was no need to apologize to me though. I wasn’t the one in seven pieces on the bottom of the Atlantic.  Billy stood from the bench, ducking his head so as to not bump it on the deck above. He only managed to squeak out that he had to take a leak. 

He climbed the ladder and Levi and I were left alone. Above us, I could hear Mac and Billy begin to argue. I stuck my head up the ladder and told them that this wasn’t helping anything but they ignored me. Billy looked at his father and started to break down. 

He put his head on Mac’s shoulder and let out great, heaving sobs. I don’t do well with displays of affection as you may have guessed so I slunk back down into the berth, even if that meant being alone with Levi who had returned to staring straight ahead. 

After a moment, I could no longer hear Billy’s anguished cries and Mac’s boots came down the ladder.  Mac sat and the way he looked at me made me realize that things had gotten even more complicated than they were, if that was possible.

They’d had a secret and I now knew about it. I was up shit’s creek without a paddle. Only the creek was the violent sea. Mac did his best not to betray what he was thinking – that there’s no way I was getting off this boat. 

He put his hands behind his head and leaned back on the hull, trying to be nonchalant. His sleeve slid down on his arm a bit, revealing a tattoo. I’d seen it before but had never given it much thought. It was across the inside of his forearm. It was a solid, black rectangle. That’s it. It was odd. But not so odd if you realize what its purpose was – it was to cover up an older tattoo.


Maybe there are hereditary predispositions toward addiction. Studies have shown that. My family tree was a lot of things, but there weren’t any drunks or druggies as far as I knew. 

I got hooked when I was eighteen, after I started using to “numb the pain” as they say. It’s a fucking cliché, I know. But I needed to escape and when somebody offered me a pill I couldn’t identify at a party the week after I was raped in the stairwell of a parking garage in the Old Port, I took it. 

I didn’t know it at the time but I was pregnant. Delightful way to lose the old v-card, eh? I hadn’t told anyone about the “incident” as I’d taken to calling it in my brain. So a couple weeks later when I missed my period I figured I’d better take a test. Two lines. 

So I “took care of it” as they said in old books and I felt guilty for doing so. The “right to choose” didn’t feel like much of a choice. But I was eighteen and what the fuck was I supposed to do? 

He’d come at me from behind as I was going to my car after having a few too many drinks at Fore Play.  He pushed me up against the wall and all I remember is his breath on my neck and his hand across my mouth. 

I struggled for a bit but then stopped fighting. Tears formed at my eyes and I looked at the inside of his forearm, begging for him to be finished. On his arm was a barcode tattoo, with a number below it 06061992. 


I let out a gasp and Mac saw that I knew. Levi smiled, because he saw that I knew. I hadn’t known Mac when I was a kid. Billy lived on Peaks with his mother, Liz. Mac and Liz weren’t together, and I’m not sure if they were ever even married. 

I realized what the tattoo was covering up. I knew Billy’s birthday because that night he’d offered me the job, he’d been out celebrating. June 6, 1992. 

I stood up and started to back slowly toward the ladder. Mac put up a hand, as if to tell me to take it easy. I trembled but couldn’t speak. 

There was a loud tunk tunk tunk on the side of the hull.  I took another step toward the ladder and Mac didn’t move toward me., he just sat next to Levi. 

I came up into the wheelhouse, my knees knocking. The blue tarp was straining and flapping in the wind, one corner having come unattached, the duct tape giving way. But that wasn’t the tunk tunk tunk noise. I looked around and couldn’t see Billy. He wasn’t on the deck either.

Tunk tunk tunk. 

Slowly, I stepped out of the wheelhouse and looked to my left. The snow came at me sideways, the waves blasting my face with icy spray.

The metal arm that had smashed the window was swung out over the water.  From it, hung Billy Machree, by his belt. 

He swayed in the wind, the tips of his boots beating on the side of the hull with a tunk tunk tunk.
