Reading horror tales, watching horror movies, series, even comic books, the usual reader always asks themself, “Why don’t people just fucking leave that haunted/dangerous/bizarre place?”. Well, I happen to live in such a place. My hometown is known for it’s dark and often uncanny history. However, I have learned throughout time that living in a place with such (well-deserved) reputation can be quite beneficial, both for me and for my co-inhabitants. I’ll show this through two examples, and then I’ll explain how the events were actually good for us. 

I was born in the august of 1979, on the small, rural Brazilian city of Horizontes Antagônicos. From the day I was born, my elders taught me how to survive and avoid trouble in our little town. I took their advice to heart. Always did. I memorized each one of the various uncanny written or unwritten rules of our town. And as a lawyer with expertise on the legal system does, I became able to navigate in these thunderous waters with ease. 

Now, I’ll tell you two events which some people call creepy that happened in our town during my lifetime, which will later prove my point. 

///

The first one is the disappearance of Alonso Gonzalez. Alonso was a close friend of mine, we studied on the same school since we were toddlers. We always sit together in class, we always played football (Or as Americans call it, soccer) together after school, on Saturday and Sundays we would go to each other’s house to watch the morning cartoons... We were really good friends.  

In the last Friday of August of 1990, Alonso and I went to the football field (In fact it was just a park with overgrown grass and one rusty crossbar. The other one had been removed a long time before and substituted by two old traffic cones.) As usual, we played with our friends, but it was more of a informal training. We were part of the school football team, and we would soon be competing against the guys from the other schools in town. It had been nearly a decade since our school last won the Horizontes Antagônicos sub-12 Football Championship, and the director promised us that should we win the trophy in that year, our grades could “accidentally” be altered to benefit us in the future. For some stupid reason, parents used to prefer to put their kids in schools where their offsprings would learn to kick a ball rather than studying. 

Our team was doing great, and I’m not being hyperbolic. We had practiced had throughout the year, and with our determination and training, we were sure we would win or at least come close to wining the championship. I mean, most of us, at least. Alonso, as good a friend as he was, he wasn’t performing very well lately. He used to be one of the best players in our team, rivaling even the captain or me sometimes. The thing is, Alonso had started smoking cigarettes. I don’t know why, he never told me, or how he was obtaining cigarettes, since selling them to minors was prohibited and he was way too young to know the shady corners of the town (Or so I thought). What I do know is that the constant dose of nicotine and other toxic substances was already impacting his health. 

Alonso could barely run ten meters without getting all tired and panting right now. We even tried to relocate him to the Gol, but even this wasn’t helping. I talked to him, to the coach, to the other players… But there wasn’t much anyone could do. Neither to help him or the team. Even if Alonso was doing bad, he still was one of our most able athletes, and our backups weren’t nearly as good as he was. 

So, here in the town there’s a tradition which all football players have to follow before playing. I don’t know why. I don’t know when it started. I can’t even remember who told me about it, it had been always so basic as “you can’t touch the ball unless you are the goalkeeper”. I even assumed that it was tradition everywhere. Just before the game starts, the goalkeepers must shake hands and walk backwards towards their positions, where they must not utter a single word until the game officially starts.

As I previously said, the crossbars on our “training grounds” were a relic of other times, and were all rusty and breaking down. Alonso performed the commencement ritual as usual. We were not tense. That happened literally every football game, and we were completely used to it. It was like washing your teeth or locking the door, an automatic process. But the moment he stepped under the crossbars, they broke down, collapsing on him. In reaction, he cursed loudly. 

We were surprised, but our coach was completely devastated. He wasn’t hurt or anything, but he had spoken before he was supposed to. We removed the broken metal bars, and our coach said that everyone needed to leave, and that he needed to take Alonso home as fast as he could. My friend was repeating that he was fine, he only got one or two bruises, but our coach simply grabbed him by his hand and ran to his car. In less than a minute, the vehicle accelerated and disappeared down the street. 

That weekend Alonso didn’t show up to play with me or watch TV as usual. I had other friends, so it didn’t bother me very much. The next morning, when I arrived in school, Alonso was nowhere to be seen, which was weird, because he lived one block away from the school and was usually one of the first students to get there. The other boys from the team were also as puzzled about what happened as I was, and our main speculation was that maybe he suffered some sort of injury that only the coach noticed or something. A few of us didn’t even remember that he failed to conclude the commencement ritual. 

One or two minutes in, the director shows up, with two of the teachers by his side. The principal told us that last Friday, during football training, Alonso got injured, and our coach (which was also our Physical Education teacher) had to take him to the hospital. However, on their way there, the car crashed into a tree and caught fire. The coach survived, although he was hospitalized, but Alonso disappeared. Emergency services were called to where it happened, but were unable to locate him, or at least his body. After searching the nearby woods on Saturday, it was concluded that he died and was consumed in the fire. No further explanations were given. We were given three days off-school. 

One week later our coach returned, now wearing a plaster cast on his leg and another one on his neck. We tried asking several times what happened that day, but he would always change the topic or outright refuse to comment on the events. He wouldn’t explain how he got those claw scars all over his cheeks and arms, or why one third of his lips seemed to be gone. He also did not explain why his car crashed in one of the roads that led out of the town, instead of the one that led to the university hospital, the only hospital in town. 

We imagined that Alonso’s family would pressure the cops into investigating more about what happened, as we knew that they barely bothered to look for him. Investigations on missing persons usually lasted for at least a week, and involved dozens of officers. In the case of Alonso they spent some 9 hours with four or five officers calling for Alonso and called him dead. However, this pressure never came. My friend’s family simply made a simple symbolic burial for him, and then literally vanished, selling their house and leaving for Uberlândia in less than three weeks.

The second event I’ll be telling you is the Murder of Natalia Pires. This happened in the March of 1997. Similarly to the first tale, I knew Natalia personally, as we were from the same class at the time, but we were nowhere near as close as I was to Alonso. Natalia was the most beautiful and disputed girl on the class and arguably one of the most disputed in the town for guys of our age. I was frankly quite handsome and athletic, but her standards were simply too high. She ended up dating the captain of the school football team, Henrique, who was literally the definition of a jock. 

I will not be getting into much details, but they were quite naughty. I’m sure she was convinced by Henrique, but they frequently fooled around on the school’s bathroom, the woods surrounding the town, the gymnasium, among other places. Some people just like the thrill of almost being caught, you know. 

But, they broke the rules. Be as kinky as you’d like, some things are just not supposed to happen in this city. One day Natalia and Henrique just didn’t show up in school. Horizontes Antagônicos would only get decent stable phone services and internet access around 2011, so we couldn’t call to ask what happened. Maybe they decided to skip school that day? Who knows. Henrique had already done it several times. Maybe he convinced Natalia. 

The following day, again, they didn’t show up. However, like previously with Alonso, the director appeared to give us some really bad news. Natalia had died two nights before, and Henrique was temporarily hospitalized. Some of the most popular boys and girls broke into tears, as both were kind of the leaders of the social “elite” of the school. I would be lying if I said I was devastated. I found Natalia quite the eye candy, but had no interest in her since she rejected me. Henrique was a good player on the football team and we were very good playing together, but out of the sport we didn’t have a very profound relationship. 

What the director’s words (and subsequent three days off-school) really did were to light up the curiosity in the entire class: What specific rule had they broken to deserve such deadly fate? I am quite curious, so I was personally involved in figuring it out. 

After a bit of me and my friends asking around, we finally found the answers we sought. Apparently, two days before, Dona Vera, one of our local cat ladies at the time, was walking some of her cats to hunt mice or something in the woods, and suddenly stumbled upon a horrifying sight of Natalia and Henrique, literally impaled in two dead trees. She had already been dead for some time, but Henrique seemed to be still alive, albeit horribly injured. Dona Vera immediately ran back to the city and alerted the authorities. A very brief investigation occurred then (it literally took one day), and the police concluded that Henrique had impaled his girlfriend before attempting to impale himself. Later that day, the emergency services managed to remove him alive from that tree, and he was immediately taken to the state capital, where he spent eight months receiving several different extensive surgeries to reconstruct his entire digestive system. 

Henrique eventually returned to town, but in shackles and under escort for three police cars, as he was attending trial for being suspect of murdering his girlfriend. That was, however, a facade. The real reason he was sentenced to thirty years in jail and taken to a state prison outside town was because he and Natalia had been fooling around in the woods, and they’d probably angered something in the process, or were too sloppy and attracted something that got offended (or aroused) by their lack of discretion. And once you anger something you were not supposed to anger here in town, you can be pretty sure it will hunt you down for as long as you live. They also probably didn’t think he would survive the damn thing, so blaming him was the easiest scapegoat to explain whatever the hell impaled both of them in those trees. 

I visited Henrique in prison once in I think 2008 or 2009. I wanted to ask him personally what happened to him, even if it was a very sensitive question, I needed to know. But as soon as he saw me Henrique just started screaming desperately with what remained of his vocal cords, and the officers asked me to leave. Some years later I heard that he had been transferred to a mental ward. I guess the trauma messed up his brain. Poor Henrique.

Now, after seeing some of the cases of unexplained disappearances and gruesome deaths in our small town, you may be wondering: “How the hell did all of this benefit Horizontes Antagônicos?” You probably wonder why one would keep living in such a dark and deadly and bizarre and outright creepy-ass town, what’s the point in living somewhere like this. From which I’ll answer, this was never about benefiting the town as a whole, but rather about benefiting it’s residents, mainly those that still lived, and mainly oneself, of course, me. Obviously, everyone has different reasons to keep living here (and loving our small town), but I assure that from what I see and know about my neighbors, they’re not very different than mine.

Let’s review the first case I presented. Alonso was my friend, but he was simply dragging our team down. I didn’t and still don’t care why he was smoking, but it was severely undermining our potential, and our coach was too afraid to do something which could harm his feelings. Coach was a good lecturer and trained us well, but when it came to being practical, he was lacking.

I tried talking to Alonso, to our coach, to the team, even to his parents, but nothing was working. We were on the verge of going to a match with a guy who couldn’t run for more than ten seconds without nearly collapsing. As important to me as Alonso was, I couldn’t risk losing the championship (and the possibility of getting good grades where I otherwise wouldn’t) because my best and closest friend couldn’t stop his stupid smoking habit.

I knew that when the goalkeeper said something between the shaking of hands and the game officially starting, something bad would happen. I though it would be more of a penalty card, and not some unknown entity literally taking him and vanishing, but… It ended up being good for the team. Alonso was replaced by a much more able and motivated goalkeeper, and we would go on to win the championship, with the trophy being celebrated on his honor. It was totally worth it to spend the entire previous night bending and trying to break those crossbars, in a way that they became so fragile that if you so much as breathed under them, they’d collapse, as they did.

In the second story I told you, I showed you what happened to Henrique and Natalia, and their ridiculously gruesome fates. Again, as with Alonso, there are parts that I omitted. Henrique and Natalia, weren’t, in fact, getting intimate in odd places as I suggested. Those were fabrications created and spread by me. The thing is, as I mentioned, Natalia was the hottest girl in town, but it was unfair that she could only be Henrique’s. He, too, made me a bit envious. Henrique was not only strongest, richest and more capable than me in many things, as well as being captain of the football team, but he barely made any effort to do so. It was so easy for him, it was almost cheating. Natalia was just the cherry on the cake. 

During my adolescence, I liked to take long walks in the woods at night, for reasons that are not relevant for me to discuss right now. That’s how I knew that little couple used to have secret romantic conversations in the woods, though it very rarely went beyond talking and handholding and PG-13 stuff. It made me angry nonetheless. I liked to watch them, to feel all that rage and hatred flowing through my veins. I found an empty space in the husk of a toppled tree nearby and I would watch them all night long, for as long as they were there, and the following day I would play football with Henrique like nothing was happening. But it was. I heard everything they talked about. Their insecurities, their fears, what they liked to eat, even very intimate stuff. That’s how I found out about Natalia’s phobia of frogs.

They also knew the rules, as I and everyone in town did. When at the woods at night, if you value your life, avoid making high-pitched noises or running. (In truth you should avoid the woods at all at night, but they were safe 70% of the times). So one Sunday-night, as they always did, Natalia and Henrique were there on their romantic place, talking and doing romantic shenanigans and whatever people in love do. I was waiting for them. I had been for hours. And then I quietly left my hideout and walked towards them. 

“Bro, what you’re doing here?” Henrique said, shocked to see me covered in ground-dirt, grass, and probably some insects, three hours after sunset, in a unmarked location, ten-minutes away from the nearest trail, deep in the woods. In my hands there was a small wooden box. Natalia was visibly surprised, but I couldn’t make much of her face, as he immediately stepped in front of her.

“I just wanted to give this to you guys.” I said as I opened my box and let the frog I had brought with me out. Natalia instinctively loudly screamed, but only for some three seconds, before her boyfriend blocked her mouth with his hand. They looked at me. First with an expression of shock, then rage, then fear and finally dread.

“W-why?!” Henrique asked, staring at me, still not knowing what to do. We could head fast, heavy steps, approaching, and breaking twigs as they did so. I smiled and sat down, closing my eyes and tapping my ears to avoid seeing and hearing whatever was coming closer. Henrique tried to fight whatever it was, but he obviously didn’t succeed. A few minutes later, when I felt the thing getting away enough for it to be safe to look, I saw both of them, impaled on those now-dead trees. 

“Don’t worry, pal. I’ll be a better team captain.” I whispered as I collected my frog, which was still in the floor, and left them to enjoy the rest of their little romantic meeting. If they were so happy together, surely they would enjoy being together for eternity.
