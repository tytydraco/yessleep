Mirror Island Part 1



Forgive me, the person who will read this, i have to get it out, before i am consumed, i am deeply sorry for you, with this knowledge,  i am inflicting my fate upon you, this happened a week ago, or more i don’t know, i lost my sense of time…



My journey in Iceland turned from an dream to a nightmare, in a slow excruciating spiral.



I was happy, visiting lost churches, abandoned tombs, elegant cemeteries, but the thing that is the reason i am writing this is, i wish my curiosity were to wither and die, i wish i never undeciphered it.



A local in the unknown city guided me to my destiny,,i should have known from the beginning, the city was not shown on the map, which i should have raised questions about it but didn't, my cursed curiosity was too busy enjoying it!



The trees were whispering, howling of the wind was like trying to communicate with me, i suppose even they were trying to warn me to go back, and never return.



It was such a beautiful day, sun was graceful, clouds were blooming, the scent of summer was carried by leaves, no day would compete with it.



As days passed on, they welcomed my presence even more, for some reason, they started to treat me differently, ladies were bringing me gifts, food, were offering to wash my clothes, men were inviting me to hunt with them, i could see the worshipping in their eyes, like they were looking at someone else, or frankly something else.



Children, their children's view on me didn't change at all, which i wanted to know why, so i spied on them, searching for the reason, why weren't they loving me just like their parents did?



As i gazed on them in the darkness, in the tent of the night, they were not entering their homes, and were sleeping on the outside, why? What would cause them for such behaviour?



In their hand was the raven symbol carved from wood, they were holding it like a beacon of light, praying, their mouths were moving, i selected some words from and they were : “par-,sifal,parsifal” so i concluded they were grounded, a great mistake by me.



In the morning a little boy knocked on my door, i was not surprised by the knocks, i was used to it by the adults, but a kid, thats a first.



He looked at me with begging eyes, his mouth moved, yet tongue remained, he tried talking, he couldn’t so he was distressed by this, little one hold my hand and gave me a note, and run as if he were a squirrel. The note said:



“Dig under the home of raven, great oak , door to the realm of dread, shall you find”



My desire to know sparked again, i couldn’t understand what this meant, home of raven, land of dread, a door? I had a shovel brought to me as a gift, so i could dig, but where?

The adventure of seeking this raven on a tree began.



While treading lightly in the forest, a group of crows or ravens started screaming, getting louder by each second, i was getting closer to it step by step, my ears drumming in agony, and i found them on a great oak tree, upon my arrival, they became silent.



Their eyes were piercing through my eyes, like the sun burning through a window, and they screamed one last time before going off.



I noticed a lot of faded leaves, yellow ones, just behind the tree, which is fascinating, because the season was summer, not fall, these leaves must have been put by someone, and i accepted the challenge.



I returned to the village, and made up my mind to dig at it in the night.



Took my shovel, and pushed off all the dead leaves away, there was nothing there, maybe it was just marker. I started digging, the roots shaked the earth beneath me and hours passed, i was tired, wanted to rest, but the last stroke, i hit a hard object.



It was a hatch, possibly left from a war, i opened it and descended by the ladder.



The place was lit by a thousand candles, this place was not abandoned and scary at all.

At the end of the corridor, was a tomb with a raven symbol, runes were written on it, i couldn’t understand.

But when i closed and opened my eyes, i could see the runes forming a dance in english:

“Utter your password”



A password? A language i couldn’t understand at first, then i could by some miracle? What does all these mean? I tried saying different sorts of thing but none worked, i had an idea then, maybe what those children murmured could work. I said “parsifal”.



The tomb was shaking, it moved aside and i saw a mirror, and what looked back, was not me, he had scars and blood all over his face and his right eye was blinded, had a crow on his shoulder. When i made that eye contact with my reflection, everything crumbled.



Did I sleep? I can't remember sleeping.I woke up near the great oak tree in a unfamiliar land, i could smell the rain of fall in the air, the season was fall, but i knew it wasn’t, this was not the village or city i was accommodating in that was for sure.



I must have imagined all this, or a dream this must be, no other explanation i thought.



Well, it is all real, because i saw the most beautiful woman in the world, jailed by the lust, she was controlling me, summoning me to her, she had a necklace of raven, this all must be connected, so i played her game, and she enlightened me, we went back to the village and the children were acting strange, children were forming around me trying to touch me, i wondered why, just before they were distant with me.



I rested at the inn, waiting  the night, for the truth. Do not read more please, or it will be too late for you too…
