**Ballydoolan Men's Team Eyes Up O'Donnell Cup - 20/07/2021**

The Ballydoolan and Cúlragh men's teams prepare for battle before the intermediate hurling final, kicking off this Saturday.

Tensions are high and our boys are hard at work preparing for the match, but as said by team captain Shane Fahy, "A win would mean the world to us, but in the end its about keeping connections with our neighbouring towns and for a bit of fun". 

Ballydoolan's last championship win was in 2001, Cúlragh's in 2014. Be sure to grab your tickets before kick off at 20:00 Saturday evening and show your support. 

The weather on Saturday night is looking to be rain free and the skies clear, so attendees may have the chance to see the Perseids meteor shower making its annual visit after the match.

**Mysterious Hum The New Buzz Around Town - 28/07/2021**

Locals have begun reporting a mysterious humming noise which began late Sunday night, leaving many baffled at its cause. Being heard primarily in the west of Ballydoolan, the hum has quickly become the talk of the town.

We spoke to a few residents to ask about their experience, and theories on the hum.

"I've three kids, and work full-time, this noise is keeping us awake all night. If the council knows the cause they need to tell us and fix it," says Sarah Bannister. 

"Ah yeah, heard it clear as anything this morning. Even had the dogs barking. Maddest thing it is. Probably new electricity work put in, I suppose," says local farmer James Geoghan. 

"Its an interesting thing, at least its getting some curious visitors in and talking about the town. Even heard some tourists were coming to look for UFO's," says Michael Leary.

Some still remain sceptical of the hum's existence in the first place, due to the persistent earache being unable to be picked up by recordings.

Be it renovations to the electricity grid or little green men, this enigma has certainly placed Ballydoolan in the public eye.

**Ballydoolan Hum Sparks Outrage - 31/07/2021**

It's been nearly a week since a strange hum started to be heard across town. Initially the subject of gossip and speculation, the noise has now spawned town-wide protests. 

Since 08:30 this morning, protesters have been stationed outside of the town council office, with the goal of getting answers about the hum. 

We spoke to local primary school teacher and organiser of the protests, Mary Sheehan, who had this to say, "The council has been completely silent all week. My class hasn't had a good night's sleep since this started, they can't focus, can't learn. It's affecting all of us and we need answers. If there's something shady going on here, some deal with a factory or fracking operations, or whatever else, we need to bring it to light."

Protests are planned all through the rest of next week, with Monday's being at Mooney Cement Works, the leading suspect of the hum's origin.

**Livestock Mutilations Plaguing Local Farmer - 02/08/2021**

On Sunday morning, James Geoghan awoke to find three of his sheep brutally killed during the night. The nature of their deaths have left both James and investigators stumped. 

According to reports, all that was left of the animals were their skins and hooves, with no trace of the rest of the carcasses. James gave his account of this gruesome vandalism, "Well I don't know what to say to be honest. Went out to the fields this morning and the sheep were acting strange like. Shaking or running away from the feed, very odd you know. I look in the corner of the field and see a pile of wool, some hooves sticking out of it, no blood or anything. Tough enough to be farming sheep with the wool prices and all, now I have to be worrying about whatever the hell this is."

On top of the Gardaí investigation into this case, the army has been spotted on private land to the west of Ballydoolan, close to James' property. Road blocks are set up, restricting movement through Killranagh and Killbeg.

**Chris:** Hi Donal, we need to discuss the latest article you wrote.

**Donal:** Hey Chris, just left the office. Need some changes done?

**Chris:** Unfortunately not that simple. We need to get rid of the entire thing.

**Donal:** What, why?

**Chris:** Just had three men come to the my office. Definitely government but had no clue what department. They threatened legal action if we published the article.

**Donal:** You know this means we're on to something right? Also how the hell did they see the article, it's only saved to our personal drives.

**Chris:** This is serious, Donal. Just scrap the article and for the love of God don't go digging, we can't afford this right now. 

**Donal:** Fine, thanks for letting me know.

**Grace Murphy Alive and Well - 09/08/2021**

In a miraculous turn of events, missing girl Grace Murphy returned to her family home in perfect health.

At 16:30, Saturday afternoon, Grace appeared at her home, to her parent's shock and delight. Grace was immediately sent for a full medical examination, revealing some memory loss surrounding her two-week absence but otherwise no injuries or health effects. 

We spoke to Grace's mother, Linda, who had this to say, "We're just so, so grateful to have our baby girl back. We couldn't sleep without knowing what happened to her, it's nothing short of a miracle."

When asked how Grace was doing, she responded, "She's doing well, a bit quieter than normal but who wouldn't be after what she went through."

We were unable to reach Grace for comment.

**Trends Changing in Ballydoolan - 09/08/2021**

The past week has marked a significant shift in the lifestyles of Ballydoolan's residents. Yesterday, a record low mass attendance was reported by St. Columbanus Church, spelling disaster for the homeless aid fundraiser.

One may be inclined to think locals have shunned their faith in favour of more frivolous pursuits, however even pub owners have noticed an unusually low number of patrons.

On top of this, the upcoming under 16's hurling match between Ballydoolan and Rathgroghan has been cancelled due to players refusing to show up for training.

Could this shift in trends be a sign of more modern values replacing age old traditions? Only time will tell.

**Document 9, Audio Transcript from Recorder Placed in the Ballydoolan Herald Office - 10/08/2021:**

**Donal:** You wanted to see me?

**Chris:** We can't publish the article.

**Donal:** Which article?

**Chris:** The Grace Murphy article. We can't publish it.

**Donal:** You're kidding me. Were those people at the office again?

**Chris:** No. Just drop the article.

**Donal:** You can't be serious. I've worked here for years and never had this problem. You can't just show up after leaving for a week unannounced and tell me I'm not allowed to do my job.

**Chris:** If you release the article through any other streams you're fired.

**Donal:** This is bullshit.

**Chris:** Don't raise your voice at me. This is your only warning.

**(Note: After Donal leaves Chris' office, Chris does not speak or move for approximately 7 hours.)**

**Document 10, Text Message Records Between Donal Keogh and Noreen Keogh - 11/08/2021:**

**Noreen:** Sheila's dog is pawing at the back door, looks hungry. Starting to get worried about her, have you seen her recently?

**Donal:** Should be some ham in the fridge, you can give him that. No, can't remember the last time I saw her. Maybe knock on her door?

**Noreen:** Just knocked, nobody there. I think I'll call the guards just to do a wellness check.

**Donal:** Good idea, keep me posted.

**Noreen:** Never mind, can see her coming in now. Shouldn't have been worrying, looks healthier than ever, not even using her walking frame.

**John:** No sorry, you that stressed?

**Donal:** Just sick of all this censorship shite. You know he actually threatened to fire me? Prick. And this fucking hum won't shut up.

**John:** Swear that thing just hasn't stopped. Might be worth looking into it a bit more, might milk another story out of it.

**Donal:** If Chris doesn't shoot it down. I can't fucking think.

**(Note: Donal gets up from his desk and picks up his bag.)**

**Donal:** I think I need a day off, could you cover for me tomorrow?

**John:** Sure thing Donal, feel better.

**Hum and Go. Viral Hum Loses Traction in Ballydoolan - 20/08/2021**

The enigmatic hum that captured Ballydoolan's imagination just a month ago has been slowly fading into obscurity, with no answers in sight. 

Mooney Cement Works was initially accused of being the source of the noise, however a swift investigation refuted these claims, leaving many scratching their heads. However, recently, many have responded to a survey claiming that they can no longer hear the hum. Lucky for some! Only 10% have reported that they still hear it. 

In other news, the 5K fundraiser for Duchenne's Awareness, scheduled for this Saturday, has been cancelled. Organisers have been forced to cancel the event in response to a shockingly low number of registered participants. The event is reportedly being rescheduled to take place in Cúlragh next month.
