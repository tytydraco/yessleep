I was casually on youtube just checking out Harry Potter movie scenes, when I stumbled upon the first scene of Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, and yes, this that I am about to tell you also happened in the same scene from the actual youtube channel of the company that made the movie. 

And what I found out was not for the weak, I heard in clear portuguese, in my language, the snake from the scene actually whispering my name, and then the point of the message which is that I will see death(yes, he told me I was going to die, in what manner? A threat? Second death in the lake of fire aka hell? Most likely, which is very frightening) and later I heard my full name including the speaker saying that he is the devil. 

Whoa! Did I just find a message from the devil?! I thought. Then I dived even deeper, and noticed what appeared to be my mother's first name in a tomb. I also noticed that he mentioned death on the first 42 seconds, could it mean anything? At this point it was full of symbolisms, the devil appearing also as a snake to Adam and Eve in the garden and speaking to Eve as well... and so on. 

But I couldn't hold the desire to share this message any longer. My heart was beating too fast at this discovery. And I couldn't keep this a secret any longer. People needed to know this, as it turns out it could prove somehow that the devil is real, at least to some people, it proved it to me, but it only depends on them, or it could prove something else, you name it. 

So I first shared with my friends, and I was fearful that it was all in my head, but for my own contentment, I figured out I wasn't the only one who could listen and read the message, and that many people, as I shared with them the message, heard it as well, well, except for the part that they could listen to my full name, they only heard the first two names from my full name. 

So I started to post as much as I could on social media and well, here I am, sharing with you guys what I just found. And I hope this message gets far, because it's not everyday that you find a message like this out there, this message is truly special, because turns out, it could be from the devil himself. 

If it weren't in a movie, they would all say it is cgi and fake, but because it is in a movie, they will say that the movie makers wouldn't necessarily do it as they wouldn't have pertinent reasons to do it, because who is this guy that the devil is speaking the name of so that they find him worthy to speak about? Is he famous already? Is he an historical figure?

If not, then why would film makers speak about him? It just wouldn't make sense. But for the devil's side it would make sense, because God has His chosen people, so the devil could target them for being chosen by God, not for being famous or historical figures. So perhaps it is that it was someone else who did it, who knows? Perhaps the devil? 

But the question that doesn't want silence is: why do I say that this person who the devil speaks the name of is me? Well, if the message is in portuguese, it must mean it is for someone from Portugal, and Portugal is tiny, and then we have got my full name which is rare, it has a rare name to it and a repeated name, which makes it less likely that the message was for some other person with my name, because it is unlikely that someone else has my full name, and then, we have what appears to be my mother's name, so it all points out to me...

...not to mention the fact that I am the one who found this message out there and who is sharing it with everyone, because if that is so, it must mean that the message was for someone whom would give it importance and who would understand it, to the point of sharing it, because why would the devil make a message for someone who would not find it, first, understand it, second, give it value, third, and share it? Fourth. 

So it makes sense the devil made the message for me, because as it seems to now, after sharing it so often, only I still give it value and share it, while nobody else seems to do it.

So? What do you think of all this? Don't come at me saying it was a message from the serpent's own language, because the message is clear portuguese, not clear snakey, and trust me, I heard real snakey language but it doesn't seem to form any words in any language whatsoever, by it's nature. 

And yes, this message needs further investigation, and as it becomes famous, it might get the exposure it needs so that investigators find it and start investigating, we need to investigate something as important as a potential message from the devil, as his death message could serve as a warning to us all and not just me. 

If it gets investigated, it will be found precisely wheter I am the person the devil is refering to, and wheter it could only be a supernatural entity to have made the message and so on. This story is frightening to some people I met, and even to myself, a message directed at me by the devil isn't something I shouldn't be affraid of, specially if it is directed at me and is from the devil, and speaks of my death.
