**If anyone from that lab has regressed like me, you should know i'm still alive and working to avoid that future. It doesn't matter if we were friends or foes on that day, let's work together.**

The rest of you, use this information however you can to survive. 

**June 7, 2037:**

Alright, so this is how it all went down. Trust me, I’d rather not be the one telling this, but someone’s gotta get the facts straight. It started with a meteorite. You’d think by now we’d have that stuff figured out, right? Wrong. People thought it was only going to be a close flyby. Until it altered it's course when it was close and we were hopelessly not prepared for it. The strike wiped out most of the Indian subcontinent. Just like that - 1 billions humans were gone and half a billion people around the world were injured from the resulting tremors and tsunamis. 

What came after was almost worse. The impact kicked up so much dust that it blocked out the sun, plunging the world into what we called the Long Winter. Crops died, temperatures plummeted, and chaos spread faster than the cold. Wars broke out over resources and land, hardly surprised anyone. That’s when the virus hit. We didn’t know it then, but the cephalovirus was already spreading, feeding off the panic and destruction left in the wake of the wars.

**February 8, 2038:**

This is the day everything changed. It was the day the world came to a standstill—global lockdowns were announced, and for a brief moment, it felt like maybe, just maybe, we could get a handle on this, even though about 25% of the population perished in a span of a year. Peace talks resumed, people tried to put aside their differences, but by then, it was too late. The virus was too widespread, the stage was set. And amidst all this, I found myself far from home, cut off from everything I knew. I was held in a high regard as i was a rare species after all. Being an Indian and post-grad in genetics, i was sure it was definitely one of the two things that made me sought after by the European Union. They never passed a cup and asked for my sample, so it was probably the latter. 

There was an American girl in our base, Annabeth, as the science department's guard. We hit it off pretty quickly due to our inappropriate humor. Knowing her gave me a glimpse at what it must be like to have a younger sister. That reminded me of my brother. He was 28 when he perished along with the rest of everyone i knew, but who cares about them? But he was different. I can still remember the time I held him a few days after he was born and realized how fragile that baby was and how weak i was. He was... divine, glowing with brilliance. He was much more whiter than me and his cheeks were so apt for his nickname, Rose. My parents told me he'd quickly grow up to play with me. I was 5 at the time, so i took it to mean he would be ready to play with me the next week. 

But as he grew up, we realized he wasn't growing as normally as other kids his age and was very prone to getting sick and injured. I remember the doctor and my mother telling 9 year old me to not be rough with him or hit him as it would greatly endanger his life. I remember being confused, thinking, "why would they tell me all that stuff? Isn't it obvious that i have to protect him as his older brother? why would i hit him of all people?". How naive we were.

As a result of being the youngest of the family and not being disciplined the Indian way, he grew up to a become a entitled brat, but he was still a good person where it counts. He used to beat me up from the time he was 5 to until his late teens, while i could never hit him back. He used to taunt me saying i was just weak, and i used to taunt him back saying he could never be as smart as me. I never got to find out if i was stronger than him as he quickly grew to become much taller and broader than me.

I'm a really selfish person, which is why none of my relationships worked, but he was the only person i'd be selfless enough to give my life to save. But i never got to have that. I could only helplessly stare at the TV, as the meteorite hit. Sometimes i wish he could've been the one alive instead. Sometimes i think he's better off in the afterlife rather than staying alive in this cold hell.

I... got sidetracked. Basically, i found someone else i genuinely cared about other than myself and that made me feel like a decent person after so long. Not that it matters.

**August 4, 2040:**

Two years in, and Europe was a wasteland. I’d joined the stronghold’s biology team by then—just three of us left, down from what I imagine was once a full team of experts. The others had all succumbed to the virus or well, *worse*. Throughout the chaos Annabeth and I kept each other sane. She was tough, smarter than anyone gave her credit for, and we both knew we were living on borrowed time, but never failed to have fun everyday.

The United States went dark on the fourth, lost to a civil war that we’d been hearing whispers about for months. They cut us off, left us to fend for ourselves. Maybe it was over resources, maybe something else, but communications dropped off completely. It is believed that the final society of the Americas has fallen, leaving a void where hope once resided. It wasn’t a shock, really—by that point, we were used to bad news. But losing them felt like the final nail in the coffin. We were on our own, and we knew it. We all knew it.

When the States went dark, it hit Annabeth hard, but she never showed it. Just clenched her jaw and kept working. No one could attempt to understand her, or claim to know how it feels to become the last survivor of your race. No one else experienced that, except me, the guy that deals with his emotions by not dealing with it! We never spoke about it in detail and just stuck to doing our work. It was all we could do, really. Work and hope that somehow, we could make a difference.

**April 16, 2041:**

This was the day we thought we had a breakthrough. I’d been going over all the data, something that had been nagging at me for weeks. And then it hit me—the cephalovirus wasn’t natural. It was a bioweapon. Designed, engineered, and unleashed. Let me tell you what the cephalovirus was capable of:

* Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)
* Enlarged and poorly functioning liver
* Purple skin splotches or a rash or both
* Enlarged spleen
* Pneumonia
* Seizures

And that's just the common ones, there were a lot more variations and uncommon symptoms to the virus ranging from pneumonia to ulcers. Furthermore, the virus was transmitted air-borne and claims from the Sydney stronghold that it was possibly transmitting through food and water too, but that was never published over a lack of consensus, as if there were still other labs other than the two of us.

Reading this, I know you all would claim that's obvious with how infectious and dangerous it was, but that is not proof. You lot claimed it for the coronavirus too. But science is all about due process and that due process was what eventually led to the fact that this virus was man-made. I didn’t know who was responsible, and to be honest, I didn’t care. What mattered was that we had proof, something tangible that might help us fight back. But even as I made that discovery, I knew deep down it wouldn’t change anything. We were already too far gone.

**March 5, 2042:**

My last lab partner died. By now, I was one of the last person in the world still trying to make sense of the virus. It tore through Europe like a firestorm. We lost more people than I care to count. I wonder how I, the one with worst GLP was still alive. The virus was smart, adaptive, like it had a mind of its own. We tried everything—vaccines, treatments, even some desperate last-minute genetic tweaks—but nothing stuck. I never came out of the lab. Annabeth was the only one to visit me, my last connection to this fucked up world. She came with food and news. Sydney and Southern Africa were still holding out, but who knows. For all I know, they’re as wiped out as we were.

That night, The stronghold was under attack. We’d had warnings, rumors of a force gathering nearby, but nothing concrete. And then they came. I was in the lab when it happened, trying to make sense of the virus’s latest mutation. I heard gunfire, screams. By the time they reached the lab, it was too late. There was no time to react, no time to think. They shot at me through the glass that separate me and my virus filled lab from the outside world. It was to sure to spread to me and the rest of the base now. One of the soldiers tried to shoot me but Annabeth tried to shield me with her body. It wasn't enough. I remember the pain, the confusion. *Why, why would she do that! How is it fair that i lose both my brother and sister before i lose my own life? Is there truly no God?* 

But the strangest part? Just before I blacked out from my own wounds, I saw this glow, like a rainbow version of the aurora borealis, shimmering above us. *Was it aurora?* *Could it be pink? Wait how is it even occurring inside my lab?!*  The aurora passed through me and then the space above me warped to show a scene of straight out of fantasy; there was a man on top of a altar, plunging his sword into the ground and being completely destroyed and reconstituted while releasing the aurora i saw earlier in waves. Everyone else were  running away from these waves, most looked like royal humans, while there were a sizable amount of creatures that seemed to be humanoid in shape too. No matter the physiology they were too slow for the wave as it passed over them and subsequently vaporized them to become these orbs of lights. There was one humanoid creature running towards me but the waves vaporized him into the light too. Then the warped space closed, but i could see the light was still heading towards the warped space, or *was it a portal?*

I don’t know what it was, but it felt... out of place, like it didn’t belong in our world. And then everything went dark.

**August 6, 2024:**

And now... well, now I’m here. Don’t ask me how—I don’t understand it myself. But I’m here, back in 2024, and I have to do something. I don’t want to be the hero. Hell, I don’t even want to be here. But I’ve seen what’s coming, and if there’s even a chance I can stop it, I have to try. If I fail, though, if everything goes to hell like I know it can, then it’s on you to survive. It won’t be easy—nothing about what’s coming is easy—but if you’ve made it this far, maybe there’s hope for you yet. Just don’t count on a happy ending.
