The fluorescent lights of Video Vault buzzed like angry hornets trapped in a tin can. Tuesday. Rain slicked the cracked asphalt outside, turning the Dollar General lot into a greasy smear. I shoved Hellraiser III back into its mangled box, another victim of Becker’s war on rewind buttons. 

  

"Kid treats basic decency like a suggestion," I muttered to the empty horror aisle. "Pure anarchy." 

  

The security monitors above the counter snapped. Not snow. Jagged, geometric static. For a split second, it locked in: The Nightjar’s Wing. That impossible symbol, looking less like a glitch and more like a brand seared onto reality. Then it dissolved back into frantic snow. 

  

My phone buzzed against a fossilized Cheeto. WV DHS Alert: Unplanned Acoustic Anomaly Detected, Mill Creek Basin. Avoid Sustained Silence. Remain Calm. 

  

I snorted. "Avoid silence? Earl’s due for his three o’clock rant about fluoride and Freemasons stealing his mail. Silence ain’t happening." I jabbed a finger at the monitor. "And you? Knock off the spooky glitch act. It’s Tuesday. We’ve got standards." 

  

The door chime clanged, harsh as a dropped hubcap. Becker stood framed in grey light, dripping onto the unwelcoming mat. He wasn’t just wet. He looked rinsed. Washed out, paper-white under the sickly fluorescents. Deep, bruised shadows hollowed his eyes. The smell hit me first. Burnt plastic. Ozone. Underneath, damp earth dug from under a rotten log, the kind that clings. A smell that sticks. 

  

He didn’t look pissed. He looked hunted. 

  

Becker: (Voice raw, thin, scraping gravel) Finch. Need to settle up. 

Me: Late fees? Hellraiser III? Kid, you owe me enough to buy Pinhead a new entourage. What’ve you got? Bartering with that three-legged possum again? 

Becker: (Fumbling frantically in his soaked hoodie pocket, eyes darting past me to the monitors) No. No possums. This. Payment. Take it. Just take it. Please. 

  

He slammed it down hard beside Pinhead’s serene judgment. A matte black cassette. No label. It didn’t reflect light; it consumed it. Denser than plastic had any right to be. Wrong. Like finding a piece of cold mountain bedrock on the counter. 

  

I stared at it. Then at Becker’s strained face. The chemical reek hung heavy. 

  

Me: What is this, Becker? Your audition tape for Toxic Avenger? Found some glowing creek sludge? 

Becker: (Shaking his head violently, rainwater flying) No! Just take it. Consider us square. For everything. Please, Finch. Shelter in place. They mean it this time. Shelter in place! 

  

He stumbled backwards out the door, vanishing into the downpour. The chime clanged again, a discordant echo. 

  

I looked down at the black tape. Cold. Unnaturally cold. Heavy. A piece of the deep dark places. 

  

"Alright," I sighed, picking it up. The cold seeped into my fingers. "Becker’s descent into madness. Let’s see what flavor of weird this is." My thumb brushed its light-swallowing surface. A faint hum vibrated against my skin. Or maybe the lights were finally dying. Outside, rain hammered the tin roof like tiny fists. My phone buzzed. Another alert? Earl? The universe calling me an idiot? Probably both. 

  

I turned the tape over. The cold deepened. The Nightjar’s Wing pulsed faintly behind my eyelids. Becker’s terror echoed. Shelter in place. 

  

"Too late for that," I muttered, heading for the back room and the ancient JVC. "Way too late." The deep hum from the monitors seemed to swell. The black tape felt heavier, hungrier, with every step towards the back room door. 

  

The black tape sat heavy in my hand. Cold seeped into my bones, deeper than the store’s damp chill. Becker’s terror lingered like ozone. Shelter in place. His voice scraped in my memory. 

  

"Yeah, right, kid," I muttered, the words thin. "Like anywhere’s safe now." 

  

The lights buzzed louder, angrier. The monitors flickered agitated snow. The DHS alert felt like a death warrant confirmation. 

  

Instinct screamed. Not the JVC. Not yet. I grabbed the ancient landline, the one smelling of dust and defeat. Dialed Earl. It rang twice, tinny and harsh. 

  

Earl: (Crackly, rain and engine noise behind him) Finch? Sounds like you’re callin’ from the bottom of a well. Or hell. 

Me: Earl. Get to the Vault. Now. Bring something stronger than your ditch weed. Maybe a crowbar. 

Earl: Crowbar? You finally snap over late fees? Mrs. Gunderson push too hard? Was it Becker? Kid’s overdue on Hellraiser again. 

Me: Becker was just here. Left something. Wrong. He looked chewed up, Earl. Spat out. Smelled like burnt wires and a wet grave. 

Earl: (Silence. The background noise faded) Wet graves? Finch, you huffin’ VCR cleaner? 

Me: I wish. No. A tape. Black. No label. Feels like ten pounds of bad news straight from a nightmare. Begged me to take it. Said ‘shelter in place’ like it mattered. 

Earl: (Longer silence. His voice dropped, the sarcasm gone) Black tape? You touched it? 

Me: Yeah. Cold. Like freezer burn on your soul. 

Earl: ...Alright. Don’t be stupid. Don’t play it. Don’t even look at it sideways. Put it somewhere. I’m comin’. Five minutes. Lock the damn door. 

  

He hung up. The dial tone buzzed flatline. I placed the black cassette carefully on the counter. It looked like a hole in the world. I half-expected frost. 

  

The minutes crawled. Rain drummed harder. Every creak was a footstep. Every flicker a warning. I aggressively alphabetized "Comedy" (Adam Sandler and forgotten rom-coms). Pointless, but moving felt better than standing still, feeling watched. 

  

The door chime rattled. Earl stood there, rain plastering his hair, hunched under soaked flannel. A lumpy canvas bag over his shoulder. He didn’t step in. His eyes scanned the store like a trapper checking for snares. They locked on the black tape. 

  

"Lock it," he ordered, voice low. 

  

I fumbled the deadbolt. The click echoed. Earl stepped in, shaking water off. He smelled like wet wool, cheap tobacco, and underneath it, something old. Ozone. Wet stone. Like Becker’s smell, but weathered, seeped into the fabric of him, like the scent of deep mineshafts clinging to old miners' clothes. He dropped the bag with a heavy thud. His eyes stayed fixed on the tape. 

  

"Describe it," he commanded, not moving closer. "Exactly." 

  

I did. The matte black. The unnatural weight. The cold. Becker’s terror. The smell. The light-eating darkness. 

  

Earl nodded slowly, a muscle ticking in his jaw. He finally looked away, scanning the store, the flickering monitors, the rain. "Shelter in place," he murmured. "They only say that when somethin’s gotten out. When the fences ain’t holdin’.” 

  

"They?" I pressed. "DHS? County? The clean-van guys?" 

  

He didn’t answer directly. Unzipping the bag, he pulled out a dented thermos. "Coffee. Strong. Mixed with somethin’ stronger." He poured a capful, pushed it my way. "Drink. You look like you seen The Devil. Or worse." 

  

I drank. Hot, bitter, cut with a sharp herbal burn. It warmed a path through the cold dread. Earl knocked his back. 

  

"Black Briar," he finally said, the name dropping heavy. "Heard of ‘em?" 

  

"Security? Vans too clean?" 

  

Earl barked a humorless laugh. "Security. Yeah. Like callin' a copperhead a garden hose. They handle… containment. For the folks who own the fences. The ones who dug too deep back in the day, in places like Hawk’s Nest. Places where the rock remembers the pain. Where the air ain’t right. Where things… linger." He gestured vaguely towards the rain-hidden hills. "My paw-paw, he worked Hawk’s Nest before the silicosis took him slow. Didn’t just cough dust. Talked about noises. Shapes in the tunnels after the blasts. Whispers on the air that weren’t air. Said the company men in suits that weren’t company came after, sealing sections off. Payin’ folks to forget. Black Briar… they’re the grandsons of those suits. Handlin’ what shouldn’t have been woken up." His eyes flicked back to the black tape. "That… looks like somethin’ Black Briar would use. Or somethin’ they’d lose." 

  

"Use? For what?" 

  

"Recordin'. Monitorin'. Could be bait." Earl took a step closer, nostrils flaring like a hound on scent. "That stink on Becker? It's baked into this thing. Like he hauled it straight outta one of their holes." His eyes locked onto mine, hard as flint. "If Black Briar lost this tape... or if somethin' down there took it back... they'll come huntin'. Meaner than a trapped coyote. And they won't blink at flattenin' whoever's standin' on top of it." 

  

The implications hit. Becker, terrified, dumping this thing like hot coals. Evidence. Or a curse passed on. 

  

My phone buzzed. Not a text. The shrill, blaring siren of a WV DHS EMERGENCY ALERT. 

  

We froze. 

  

The screen blared red: 

SHELTER IN PLACE IMMEDIATE 

LOCATION: MILL CREEK CROSSROADS & SURROUNDING AREA 

REASON: CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL DELTA INITIATED. UNAUTHORIZED BIOHAZARD RELEASE. 

REMAIN INDOORS. SEAL WINDOWS/DOORS. DISREGARD ALL OUTSIDE MOVEMENT. AWAIT OFFICIAL CONTAINMENT TEAM. REMAIN CALM. 

  

"Containment Protocol Delta," Earl breathed, face paling. "Biohazard release." He looked from the alert to the tape, then to the front. "That ain’t gas, Finch. That’s a breach. Something got loose they couldn’t cap." 

  

As if summoned, the lights dipped violently, plunging us into darkness before surging back, harsher. The buzzing climbed to a skull-scraping whine. The security monitors didn’t flicker. 

  

They went black. 

  

All of them. 

  

Utter, silent darkness on every screen. 

  

Then, one by one, they flickered back on. 

  

Not the parking lot. Not the aisles. 

  

A high-up view. Looking down at the counter. At us. Grainy, black and white, distorted… but unmistakably Video Vault. Right now. From the ceiling camera. 

  

Earl and I stood frozen, staring up at our own grainy ghosts. The camera was fixed on Aisle 3. 

  

But in the flickering image, on the edge, between "Cult Classics" and "Creature Features," a shape resolved from the static. Hunched. Angular. Utterly still. 

   

Its head, a rough, dark silhouette, was tilted upwards. Towards the camera lens. 

  

Two pinpricks of sickly, greenish-yellow light ignited in the shadow. Unblinking. Fixed on the screen. Fixed on the tiny, flickering images of us. 

  

The piercing whine dropped into that deep, resonant hum from the tape. It vibrated the floor, syncing with my frantic heartbeat. The Shelter in Place alert screamed from my phone, useless against the impossible dread solidifying in the room. 

  

On the monitor, the thing in Aisle 3 didn’t move. It just watched. The green eyes burned like toxic stars in the screen's gloom. The hum wasn't just sound anymore. It was pressure. A physical weight pushing down on the air, thick as the wet wool smell clinging to Earl. My own heartbeat thudded in my ears, a frantic counterpoint to that deep, resonant drone. The Shelter in Place alert screamed its digital panic, utterly dwarfed by the silent, green-eyed stare burning from the security monitors. 

  

Earl didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. He was carved from the same damp stone as the hills, eyes locked on the tiny, flickering image. That gaze, through the lens, through the screen, felt like ice water trickling down my spine. 

  

"Earl..." My voice was a dry rasp, swallowed by the hum. "It’s watching." 

  

"Not just watchin’," Earl breathed, his voice low and stripped bare. "Learnin’. Sizin’ us up. Seein’ how scared we are." He finally tore his eyes away, looking at me. The raw fear there was worse than the thing on the monitor. Earl wasn’t scared of much. "Black Briar don’t cry Delta for squirrels, Finch. Means somethin’ big got loose. Somethin’ they can’t just hose down or dynamite shut like a bad vein." 

  

The implication hung in the ozone-tinged air. Becker brought the breach. Or the breach followed him. The black rectangle sat on the counter like a cursed mountain stone, radiating cold malice. 

  

On the monitor, the hunched shape remained motionless. The twin green points unwavering. Studying. 

  

"What do we do?" The question felt stupid, desperate. Seal windows? Against that? Wait for Black Briar to torch the place? 

  

"Seal up?" Earl scoffed, a harsh, humorless sound. "Against whatever crawled outta them old tunnels? Look at it. You think Sheetrock and a deadbolt gonna stop somethin’ that walks through rock?" He jerked his thumb towards the back room. "That JVC. That tape. That’s the wound Becker opened. This place is bleedin’ bad air now." 

  

The lights flickered violently, the buzz climbing back to a skull-scraping whine. On the monitor bank, the image stuttered. For a split second, the view changed. Not Aisle 3. It was the back room. Grainy, distorted. The ancient JVC. The pile of dead remotes. The dark CRT. The perspective from the camera inside the back room door. 

  

Then it snapped back to Aisle 3. The angular shape hadn’t moved. But the green lights… had they flared? 

  

"Did you see?" I choked. "The back room..." 

  

Earl nodded grimly. "It’s mappin’. Movin’ its sight. Or worse… there’s more than one already here." He took a slow step towards the counter, towards his canvas bag. He unzipped it fully. Inside: a heavy Maglite, a worn leather roll, and a small, cloth-wrapped bundle smelling of gunpowder and bitter mountain herbs. He pulled out the Maglite, hefting it. 

  

"Containment team ain’t comin’ to rescue, Finch," he said, voice urgent. "They’re comin’ to scorch earth. Burn it clean. Us included. Just loose ends in a ‘biohazard’ report." He nodded at the black tape. "That thing? That’s the proof they wanna erase. Becker knew. That’s why he ran. Why he dumped it here." He flicked the Maglite on. The beam cut the gloom, landing on the black cassette. It seemed to swallow the light. "We gotta ditch it. Before they get here. Or before it decides playtime’s over." 

  

"Ditch it? How? Throw it out? It feels… alive, Earl. Wrong. You think it’ll just let go?" 

  

Earl’s eyes darted to the monitors. The green lights still fixed. Unblinking. "Maybe not ditch," he murmured, a dangerous edge in his voice. "Destroy it. Fry it. Melt it down to slag." He pointed to the back room door. "That old furnace closet… sounds like a dragon coughin’. Gets hotter than a mine fire." 

  

The ancient oil furnace. A relic. It roared, radiating heat through its thin metal door. Insane. Suicidal. 

  

"It’s sealed," I argued, panic rising. "The door’s warped shut! That furnace could blow!" 

  

"Better’n Black Briar’s napalm," Earl shot back. "Or lettin’ that finish its tour." He moved slowly towards the back room door, beam on the floor. "Grab somethin’. Crowbar. Fire extinguisher. Heavy. We gotta pry that closet open." 

  

I lunged for the crowbar under overdue notices, cold steel shocking my sweaty palm. As I grabbed it, my gaze swept the monitors. 

  

The image hadn’t changed. The hunched shape. The green eyes. 

  

But on the parking lot feed, pure static flickered. Resolved. Not the lot. Another internal view. High angle. Looking down at the front counter. Where the black tape sat. Where Earl and I had stood. 

  

No camera there. 

  

Standing beside the counter, half-obscured by static, was another angular silhouette. Slightly taller. Same rough, light-eating surface. Same two pinpricks of sickly green light, angled not at the counter, but towards the back room door. 

  

Where Earl was reaching for the handle. 

  

"EARL!" The scream tore raw from my throat. "LOOK!" 

  

Earl froze, hand inches from the knob. He followed my stare to the parking lot monitor. Saw it. The second shape. Watching the door. Waiting. 

  

The deep hum surged, vibrating the floor violently. Lights flickered wildly, plunging us into strobing darkness. In the chaotic flashes, the monitors showed rapid glimpses: 

  

Aisle 3: The first shape taking a single, jerky step forward. 

  

Front Counter: The second shape turning its head, green eyes swiveling towards the camera, towards us. 

  

Parking Lot: Static resolving into rain-lashed asphalt… and a sleek, blindingly white Black Briar Security van silently blocking the exit. Doors opening. 

  

The Shelter in Place alert screamed: REMAIN CALM. AWAIT CONTAINMENT TEAM. 

  

Calm was gone. The thing in Aisle 3 moved. The thing by the counter saw us. Black Briar was here. The tape sat like a malevolent heart. The furnace door remained shut. Trapped between the breach and the burn squad, crowbar in hand, Earl’s nerve fraying. The hum vibrated my teeth. The green eyes watched from every screen.  

 

The crowbar’s cold steel bit into my palm. Useless weight against the deeper chill radiating from the black tape on the counter, or the ice flooding my veins. On the monitors, chaos strobed: 

  

Aisle 3: The first hunched shape lurched forward another jerky step. Pinprick green eyes fixed on the camera. Fixed on us. 

  

Front Counter: The second angular silhouette by the register turned its head with a stutter-stop motion. Those same sickly green lights swiveled, locking onto the back room door. Onto Earl, frozen with his hand hovering over the knob. 

  

Parking Lot: Rain sheeting down, washing over the blinding white hull of the Black Briar van. Four figures in matte-black, full-face respirators and bulky, unmarked tactical gear already on the asphalt, moving with unnerving silence and precision towards Video Vault's entrance. A fifth figure remained by the van, holding something that looked like a cross between a radar dish and a flamethrower nozzle. 

  

The deep, resonant hum surged, vibrating the floorboards so hard dust rained from the ceiling tiles. The lights flickered violently, plunging us into near-total darkness for terrifying seconds before snapping back on, harsher, buzzing like a swarm trapped in glass. The Shelter in Place alert screamed its digital panic from my phone, now almost drowned out. 

  

"CONTAINMENT TEAM ON SITE," a synthesized, emotionless voice boomed from outside, amplified, cutting through the rain and the siren. "REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE. DO NOT INTERFERE." 

  

Earl ripped his hand back from the doorknob like it was electrified. He stumbled back into the main store, face ashen under the strobing fluorescents. His eyes darted between the monitors showing the approaching Black Briar goons and the one showing the second entity by the counter, its green gaze now fixed on the front door. 

  

"Interfere?" Earl spat, terror and fury warping his voice. "They ain't here for us, Finch. We're loose ends. Witnesses to their dirty laundry." He pointed a shaking finger at the black tape. "They want that back in their hole. They'll burn this place to cinders to get it and erase the trail. Us included." 

  

On the Aisle 3 monitor, the first entity took another step. It was nearing the end of the aisle. Closer to the open space near the counter. Closer to us. 

  

The heavy THUMP on the front door made us both flinch. Not a knock. A single, authoritative impact, testing the frame’s strength. 

  

"OPEN THE DOOR." The amplified voice was flat. Commanding. Utterly devoid of humanity. "COMPLY FOR YOUR SAFETY." 

  

"My safety?" I choked out, gripping the crowbar tighter. "They’ve got a goddamn flamethrower pointed at the door, Earl!" 

  

Earl’s eyes were wild, scanning the cramped store. The back room: dead end. The front door: about to be breached. The furnace plan: ashes. He lunged for the canvas bag, yanking out the cloth-wrapped bundle. He tore it open, revealing three crude, fist-sized lumps wrapped in waxed paper and twine. The smell of sulfur and bitter herbs, ginseng root and something acrid like devil's shoestring, filled the small space. 

  

"Distractions," he hissed, shoving one into my free hand. It was heavy, cold, and greasy. "Light the fuse, throw it hard towards the horror section, run like hell for the back room. Don't look back. Might buy us seconds. Ground pepper, flash powder, a pinch of saltpeter, old tricks for spookin' things that ain't quite solid yet." 

  

"Seconds from what?" Panic clawed at my throat. "Them?" I gestured to the monitors. "Or them?" I pointed at the door. 

  

"Does it matter?" Earl rasped, pulling a battered Zippo from his pocket. His hands trembled violently as he flicked it open. The small flame looked pitiful against the encroaching dread. "Just be ready to bolt when it pops. Don't think. Just run." 

  

Another heavy THUMP on the door. Louder. Wood splintered around the deadbolt. On the monitor, the two Black Briar operatives braced, raising compact, blocky weapons that hummed with a low, predatory whine. 

  

On the other monitors: 

  

The entity in Aisle 3 was now fully visible. Hunched, maybe five feet tall, its surface a rough, non-reflective black that seemed to drink the light. Limbs too long, too thin, ending in sharp, articulated points. The green eyes burned like toxic stars in its faceless head. It didn't advance further. It watched the front door. Waiting. 

  

The entity by the counter mirrored its stance. Utterly still. Green eyes fixed on the entrance. 

  

They weren't focused on us anymore. The bigger disturbance was outside. The breach was meeting the containment. We were just rats in the walls. 

  

"Now, Finch!" Earl yelled, touching the Zippo's flame to the short, braided fuse on his bundle. It sparked, sizzled, and began burning with alarming speed, emitting thick, acrid smoke. He drew his arm back, aiming for the space near the Cult Classics shelf. "LIGHT IT! THROW!" 

  

My fingers fumbled. The Zippo felt alien. The fuse seemed impossibly short. The thumping became a rhythmic BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. Wood splintered loudly. The Black Briar agent with the flamer-nozzle device raised it, aiming through the door. 

  

The entity in Aisle 3 tilted its head, a sharp, bird-like motion. The green eyes flared, casting sickly light on the shelves nearby. 

  

Earl's fuse was halfway gone. He hurled his bundle in a high arc towards the horror section. "FINCH! NOW!" 

  

I touched the flame to my fuse. It caught instantly, spitting angry sparks. I didn't aim. I chucked it blindly towards the front of the store, towards the shuddering door and the waiting entity near the counter, then dove behind the relative cover of the checkout counter, dragging Earl down with me. He landed hard, the breath knocked out of him. 

  

The world didn't explode with fire. It detonated with sound and light. 

  

Earl's bundle detonated near the horror shelves with a deafening POP! that shook the building. A concussive wave of force slammed through the air, followed by an eye-searing flare of pure, magnesium-white light that burned through my closed eyelids. The shockwave rattled the shelves violently; tapes cascaded down like plastic shrapnel. My bundle landed near the front door and erupted a split-second later with another POP! and blinding flash, filling the front of the store with searing light and thick, choking, sulfurous smoke. 

  

A hellish chorus erupted. High-pitched, shrieking electronic feedback tore from the security monitors, mingling with synthesized shouts of surprise and alarm from outside. The rhythmic pounding on the door stopped dead. The monitors showed nothing but static and overwhelming white glare. 

  

The deep hum from the entities spiked into a shriek of pure dissonance that vibrated the counter I was pressed against, rattling my teeth. The strobing lights cut out completely, plunging Video Vault into near-total darkness, lit only by the dying, sputtering embers of Earl's flashbangs and the faint, hellish green glow emanating from where the entities had been standing. 

  

Earl was already moving, scrambling on hands and knees towards the back room, coughing violently. "GO! GO! MOVE! NOW!" 

  

I scrambled after him, lungs burning from the acrid smoke, ears ringing, vision swimming with purple afterimages. Behind us, in the swirling, smoke-choked gloom near the front, the piercing green lights reappeared, not two pairs, but four. They moved erratically, swirling with furious speed through the haze like enraged fireflies. The electronic shrieking continued, now mixed with guttural, clicking sounds that scraped against my nerves. 

  

We burst through the back room door. Earl slammed it shut behind us, fumbling for the flimsy interior bolt. It slid home with a pathetic click. He leaned against the door, chest heaving, face slick with sweat and soot. 

  

"Won't hold," he gasped. "Not against them. Not against Black Briar’s breaching tools. Not for long." 

  

The back room felt claustrophobic, marginally safer only because it was smaller, darker. The ancient JVC sat silently on the table, a mute witness. The black tape was still out front, on the counter, in the heart of the chaos. The furnace closet door remained warped, impassable, a mocking monument to a failed plan. 

  

From the main store, sounds of conflict erupted. Not gunfire. Something worse. A high-pitched, oscillating WHINE that set my fillings on edge, punctuated by concussive THUD sounds and the continued, furious shrieking clicks of the entities. The Black Briar team was inside. They’d breached. And they’d walked straight into the uncanny they were supposed to contain. 

  

Earl pressed his ear to the thin door. His face, lit by the dim, erratic glow filtering under it, was grim. "They're tanglin' with ‘em," he whispered hoarsely. "Black Briar and… them. Buyin’ us time. Not much. That whine… sounds like their sonic prodders. Meant to disrupt, not kill. Won’t stop those things for long." 

  

He looked around the cramped space, his eyes landing on the small, high, grime-coated window near the ceiling. Barely big enough to squeeze through, leading to the narrow, rain-lashed alley behind the store. "Only way out," he said, pointing. "Gotta go. Now. Before whoever wins that fight remembers the rats in the walls." 

  

The window was old, the frame swollen, painted shut a dozen times over. Outside, the rain still lashed down. The Shelter in Place alert still screamed its futile warning, muffled now. The sounds of the otherworldly skirmish, the whines, the thuds, the shrieks, were intensifying. Getting closer. Something heavy crashed into a shelf out front, followed by a guttural electronic scream that cut off abruptly. 

  

The tape was still out there. The breach was still open. Our only escape was a painted-shut window leading into the storm-lashed alley, with God-knew-what, Black Briar patrols, more entities, or just the suffocating weight of the government’s secret war, waiting on the other side. The cold from the tape seemed to have seeped into the very air of the back room, and the green eyes, though unseen now, felt like they were still watching from the static-filled dark beyond the door. Waiting for the next desperate move. The crowbar felt suddenly very heavy in my hand, and very, very small.  

 

The painted window frame fought like a rusted coffin lid. Earl braced his boots against the wall, veins bulging in his neck as he heaved against the crowbar jammed under the swollen wood. Rainwater streamed down the filthy glass, blurring the dark alley beyond into a wet smear of brick and overflowing dumpsters. Each grunt from Earl was punctuated by the cacophony from the store: the shriek-whine of Black Briar weapons, the guttural thuds of impacts, and the unnerving, chittering clicks of the entities. 

  

"Almost... got it..." Earl gasped. With a final, splintering crack, the bottom corner of the window frame tore loose. Cold, rain-lashed air blasted into the cramped back room, carrying the smell of wet asphalt, rotting garbage, and the faint, ever-present tang of coal dust that clung to Mill Creek like a ghost. "You first, Finch! Go!" 

  

No time for debate. I shoved the crowbar into my belt, grabbed the gritty windowsill, and hauled myself up. The opening was tight, scraping skin off my ribs as I wriggled through headfirst. I landed hard on slick concrete, the impact jarring my knees. Rain instantly plastered my hair to my skull, icy water trickling down my collar. The alley was narrow, canyoned by the backs of the Video Vault and the shuttered hardware store next door. One flickering security light above a rusted dumpster cast long, dancing shadows. 

  

Earl followed, landing with a heavier thud and a pained grunt. He immediately hunched over, hands on knees, wheezing. "Damn... lungs ain't... what they used to be..." he rasped. "Used to chase deer up Spruce Knob... now a damn window... near kills me." His flannel was dark with rain and sweat, plastered to his broad back. The canvas bag was still slung over his shoulder, lumpy and ominous. 

  

From inside the Video Vault, a sound cut through the rain, a high-frequency electronic screech followed by a wet, crunching pop, then silence. Utter silence. Even the Shelter in Place alert on my abandoned phone had stopped. The sudden quiet was more terrifying than the noise. 

  

"They silenced one," Earl whispered, straightening up with effort, his eyes wide and reflecting the dumpster light. "Or it silenced them. Either way... bad news. We gotta move." He pointed down the alley towards the deeper darkness where it met the woods encroaching on the town's edge. "Creek path. Behind the old Baptist church. Only way they won't have eyes on."
