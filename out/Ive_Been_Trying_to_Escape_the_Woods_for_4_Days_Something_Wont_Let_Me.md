Day 4. I’m still trapped in this cursed forest, and something is keeping me from finding my way out. Every time I think I’m making progress, I end up back where I started. The trees and paths shift, confusing my sense of direction. I’m starting to believe there’s more to this place than meets the eye. But let me back up a bit and tell you how I got here.

Four days ago, I decided to go on a solo camping trip to clear my mind. Work had been stressful, and I needed some time away from the city. I found a remote forest online that seemed perfect – quiet, untouched, and far from civilization. It sounded like a dream come true.

The first day was uneventful. I set up my tent, gathered firewood, and cooked a simple meal. The serenity of the forest was exactly what I needed. As night fell, I sat by the fire, listening to the sounds of nature. It was peaceful, almost therapeutic. Little did I know, it would be the last peaceful night I’d have.

On the second day, I decided to explore deeper into the forest. I left markers along the way to ensure I wouldn’t get lost. The forest was beautiful, but there was something eerie about it. The deeper I went, the denser the trees became, and the sunlight struggled to penetrate the canopy.

Around noon, I noticed something strange. Despite following my markers, I felt like I was going in circles. The trees all looked the same, and my sense of direction became unreliable. I decided to head back to my camp, but the path seemed different, unfamiliar.

That night, as I sat by the fire, I heard whispers. At first, I thought it was the wind, but the whispers grew louder, more distinct. They seemed to come from all around me, echoing through the trees. I tried to ignore them, convincing myself it was just my imagination. Sleep didn’t come easy that night.

Day three was when things took a turn for the worse. I woke up to find my markers gone. Every attempt to leave the forest was met with failure. Paths twisted and turned, leading me back to the same spot. Panic set in as I realized I was truly lost.

I decided to stay put and ration my supplies, hoping someone would find me. That night, the whispers returned, but this time, they were accompanied by shadows. Dark, fleeting figures moved at the edge of my vision. Whenever I turned to look, they vanished.

Today is day four. I’m exhausted, hungry, and losing hope. The whispers are constant now, and the shadows feel closer. I’ve tried every possible direction, but the forest seems determined to keep me here. I’ve been writing this down in my journal, hoping it might help someone understand what’s happening to me.

I’ll update again if I can. If anyone reads this, know that something in this forest doesn’t want me to leave. And if I don’t make it out, at least my story will be told.
