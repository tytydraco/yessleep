Now as a way for me to begin let me introduce myself, I am a 23 year old man who had just bought a new house for myself since I live alone this recently awhile back. I had looked around the house for a good while as I had searched the bedrooms and the hallways the house itself seemed to be a pretty good size for how much it was worth at the time, or at least I had thought it was worth it at the time. 

But surely nonetheless for sure as I had moved in I put stuff in the bedroom like boxes and some other things to no ones knowledge but surely nonetheless nothing to be out of the ordinary for the whole after I had moved in and then eventually it had come at night and only at night for some reason, not sure as to why though honestly. But during the middle of the night while I had slept on the couch in the living room, I kept hearing a rapid knocking under the floor beneath me and soon all over the rest of the house. I wasn't sure what the hell it was or where the sound was coming from but I knew for sure it was beneath me all the time during at night and only at night always around 3:00am not really sure why that time though but I was always told as a kid that 3:00am was the witching hour where spirits and ghosts come through and then try to interact with the living world when the vail between the world of the living and the world of the dead is at it's thinnest.

Now for sure this would be crazy to think since I had already bought and owned the house at the time and I wasn't gonna let something like that scare me away that easily. I don't scare easily by the way but knowing for sure it is something that I would not have thought of with a logical thought or reason because why would that be the first conclusion to come to? Not sure as to why though considering since most of everything if realistically I had always had thought the house was just settling in at the time, but damn. It's almost crazy to believe that I had changed thought after discovering the crawlspace in the kitchens bathroom but more on that later at a more appropriate time. So of course every night all night around 3:00am the knocking would start, it would appear as slow at first but then the more it kept going it became faster and faster more rapid not like in a way of like panic or anything but it was more likely it was......well it was knocking so I couldn't really figure out a eay to describe it other rhythmic and paced and it had also sounded like at times like a tapping knock.

This would happen every night and all night like I had said it would be but you know nonetheless what was there to complain it was knocking, that's all that was I had logically thought it was rats and so I figured that maybe tomorrow I could call pest control and see if they can send a guy over and take care of it. Not sure as to what could be down there but I don't usually wanna like look around to see what it was to be honest.

I'll probably update you on the further note of things to see where this escalates for sure but I'm not entirely sure as to what the crawlspace was for sure exactly except for storing stuff down there. Also apologies if this entry is short it's just a lot had happened and everything so please be patient. 
I promise okay?
