[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f6l9fg/after_last_night_i_can_no_longer_go_to_places/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)



I haven’t been eating. 

Or sleeping really…



The last few days have been a strange whirlwind of conflicting thoughts and ideas.

I haven’t left my bed for any longer than a bathroom break. The food my Dad prepares for me just sits at the door, wasting away to the dry, stale air. The two times I even attempted nourishment, I found myself gagging. 



It didn’t smell right. 

Although Dad assured me, “It’s how I’ve always made it,” the Bolognese gave off a visceral scent of death and decay.



It smelt like dirty garbage, a convoluted concoction of various mouldy fruits and stale beer bottles. A scent that I’ve dealt with before, but has never followed me home.



And then I could hear something. Feel something. Something that rattles my spine, clicking each vertebrae out of place, and startles me to my core.



*Hey.* 



The word echoes in my head like a burst of blunt needles searching for a way out.



My senses are still stuck at the waste bin.



The stained paper. I’d been reading it, and re-reading it for days. 



I’ve been calling in sick to work. My manager understood on the first day, she assured me, “Of course. It’s quiet tonight, so we can manage.”



After day three, she begrudges, “Take the week off,” and hangs up.



After all of this, I may end up losing my job.



I feel like I’ve been stripped of my being. My core. My sense of self. The sleep deprivation has caused me immense issues. 

I've been hyper fixating on little things, and have found myself repeating all of my worst habits. My fingernails have gradually receded down to my cuticles with consistent incremental chewing. I’ve ripped off more hangnails than hours in the day, and the skin around them has bled on more than one occasion. 



I’ve butchered my hands. 



All I can picture is using them behind the bar - cutting up lemons, or salting glass rims. Envisioning the searing torture my hands would endure as the ingredients found their way into each minuscule wound. A sensation I’m accustomed to, but to this extreme, I may suffer immensely-



My phone vibrates.



I know what to expect.



He found a phone.



He did.



I snatch the device up and read the following:



*R u mad at mee?*



The spelling is atrocious, just like the others.

I put it back down, just within reach. 

It waits patiently, and is ever so still-



It starts to ring. 

And it rings. 

And it rings.



**One missed call.** Another text message.



*Wy u ar not ansar?* 



**One missed call.** Another text message.



*Weh r u?*



***Three missed calls.*** *Another text message*



*Clair, i did not se u, u not ther nymor?*



***Twelve missed calls.*** *Another text message another text message another text message-*

**Total missed calls:** One Hundred and Eighty-Two

**Total unread messages:** Countless



This has been the last 48 hours of my fucking life.



**Another missed call.**

I toss my phone across the room. It bounces off the wall and with a splitting *crack,* it flops onto my desk.

**Another missed call.**

I succumb to that niggling itch at the back of my mind.

**Another missed call.**



*Hey.* The word rings in my head again.



**Another fucking missed call.**



*Hey.* This I swear I can hear-



**ANOTHER FUCKING MISSED CALL**



*“*Hey.*”* This one I can hear, I can actually hear it. It’s coming from my window. He’s outside my fucking window. ***FUCK FUCK FUCK****- HOW DID HE FIND ME, HOW DOES HE KNOW-*



“GO AWAY,” I scream to my curtain.



“HEY.”



“I SAID FUCK OFF.”



“CLAIR.”



“PLEASE.”



“CLAIR.”



I catch myself about to open the curtains when I feel a large hand on my shoulder. I begin to flail, slipping my hand into my pocket and arming myself with imaginary keys. I strike once and see him.



It’s my Dad. 

I’ve struck him in the chest.



Straight away he grips my arms tight, and assures me.



“Clair, hey. Bubba. You’re alright. You’re okay. It’s Dad.”



I look into his spectacles - the whites of his eyes larger and more concerned than I’d ever seen them. 

My face begins to swell with emotion. From disaster, to shock, to hatred, and finally relief.   
  


“I’m sorry,” the words leave my mouth alongside an overwhelming stream of tears, “I’m really sorry, Dad, I thought-”



He pulls me into a warm and soft embrace that squeezes out the remaining waterworks.



“You’re okay, sweetpea. *I’m* sorry.”



“I thought-”



I know, baby.”



He looks down into my eyes, a look that encapsulates everything our relationship stands for. Love in the best and worst of times.



He then drops a bomb, “You have a visitor.”



I feel it. The fear again begins to rise. It’s bubbling up, I can feel it surging-



“A friend from your work,” he soaks up my tears with the edge of his sleeve, “But, I’ll tell them you’re still unwell.”



*Abbey…*

I hadn’t realised how much I missed her. 



Dad rubs my shoulder and turns to leave.



“No, wait,” I swallow the lump that has found its way to the back of my throat, “I’m okay. I want to see them.”



He gives me a final look, one that says, *Are you sure that’s for the best?* 

I nod, and he kisses my forehead.



I give a forced smile, tug at my pyjama shirt and say, “Just let me change first.”



+++



I hear the footsteps make their way up the stairs. I sit cross legged on my bed, and take a quick peek out of the window. All I see is a row of tall trees, and birds zipping past the clouds.



I then hear my Dads voice instruct, “Just on your left, mate.”



*Abbey knows which room is mine, Dad,* I think to myself, *She’s been here before.*



Then, from around the corner of the door frame, I see short brown hair that leads its way up the stairs, a built, masculine body following close behind. 



*No…*



For a few moments, I believe my father has been swindled. 

Then, I find the body oddly familiar as it wraps around the railing. 



I recognise it as a regular pain in my ass.



“Will?”



The fuckwit carefully enters. He stands just on the cusp of the door.



He examines me, and takes a brief look around my room, which we can both acknowledge is in shambles. He attempts contact.



“How- How ya doing?” He stumbles through his words.



I shoot his way a curious and scornful look, “How am I *doing*?”



He clears his throat, “Yeah,... How are you?”



“Not great, Will.”



“Yeah.”



“Yeah.”



The air is thick with expectation.



“Okay,” I begin with a demeaning tone, “Why are you here, Will?” 



He points to my desk chair, “Can I sit here?”



“No.” 



He drops his hand. He sighs.



“Okay, look - can you come back to work?”



I scoff. 



“What?”



“They’ve put me on bar. I don’t want to do bar. I barely even know how to - Doesn’t matter, can you just come back?”



“I’m sick.”



“Yeah, I can tell, you look disgusting.”



My face is ever more scornful. I watch his face soften.



“Sorry.” He makes a half-assed apology, “I get mean when I’m frustrated.”



“Yeah, I know, you’re a cunt.”



‘I am,” He lets out a hesitant giggle. I don’t reciprocate. “I just-”



My phone then rings from across the room. I stare as its cracked screen lights up with a menacing glow. Will looks over at it, then to me.



We give it a couple of seconds. 



“Did you wanna get that?”



I subtly shake my head and we listen to the call ring out.



Will starts up again.



 “Do you think you’ll be able to work tom-” and the phone rings again. Will joins me in watching the device hum along the desk’s wooden panelling. 



“I don’t mind-”



“Shut up, Will.”



He shrugs it off. Then it’s silent for just a moment before it begins to ring again. 



And again



And again-



Will darts over to it. 



“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” I plead, “WILL!”



He snatches the phone-



“PLEASE!”



-presses the green button- 



“DON’T!”



-And raises it to his ear.



I hold my breath, tucking myself securely into my arms in a vertical foetal position on the bed. My ears perk up, concentrating directly on the miniscule, staticky whispering from the isolated speaker.



Will says nothing, and just listens. His brow furrows and his eyes begin to wander. He's trying to picture whoever this stranger is on the other line. 



He looks at me.



Then he hangs up.



He reads the number listed, and then asks with an undermining tilt in his voice, “Is *this* why I’ve had to do bar for two days?”



+++



I explained everything to him. The bin run. The man. The paper. The list of text messages and missed calls. 

By this point I had slipped under my bed covers, my thoughts teetering on the precipice between being present, and sinking back into that horrifying night. 

My sheets provide me with a sense of grounding.



And Will. He listens to everything. Just listened to every word. Didn’t interject, didn’t laugh.



Just listened.



He leans back in my desk chair, and lets out a forceful gust of air from his lips.



“That’s fucked,” He exclaims, “That’s really fucked up. I’m sorry.”



“And now,” I gesture to my room, “I’m stuck here. I can’t leave. I just… I can’t leave.”



He looks around, “Yeah. Honestly, I’d kill myself if I had to spend more than a day in here.”



He laughs.



I laugh with him. I feel a sense of weight fall from my shoulders.



We sit in silence, but this time the silence is active. 

I can tell Will is thinking, and I’m glad he has taken that burden from me. 

His eyes spot something, just to my right. He quickly rises from the chair and walks over to my lamp. 

He reaches past my bedside table.



“What are you doing?” I watch his hand disappear down beside my bed, and from it he pulls a medium sized baseball bat. 

On the side of the smooth wood a decal reads, ‘*Berry. Home of the Bumblebees’* 

The *Bumblebees* being our regional team.



At first, I was bewildered by its discovery, then remembered I had grabbed it days prior. I stole it from Dad’s stash of memorabilia.



Whether I’d have used it, is another thing.



Will holds the bat in both hands and carefully raises it, slowly mimicking a swipe down motion. I watch his fingers wriggle around the neck, securing themselves, and quickly he swings the bat through to the left.



“What are you doing?” I ask again. 

Perhaps he plans to end my misery.



He examines his weapon of choice and it never leaves his gaze.



‘What if we scared off the guy?” He suggests.



“What?”



“I said, what if we scared him?”



“I *know*, but what-” 



Will grabs my phone from just in front of me. It’s been turned off, but Will reverses that decision and flips the bottom of it towards me, the top pinched between his thumb and fingers.



“Text him. Tell him to meet.”



I gasped, and secured myself even tighter in my fluffy green sheets.



“Are you fucking crazy?”



“Clair, you look so fucking horrible right now" His words a harsh but they stem from genuine concern, "If he doesn't end up killing you, the stress will.”



I stare into his eyes. 

They mean business. 

His breathing is deep and-



“Do you want it to end?” He leans in, “*Do you* want it to end..?”



*I don’t-*  
  


“Then text him.”



I hesitate for a moment, then carefully grab the phone from him. As the cracked screen glares at me, it begins to buzz relentlessly. Hundreds of missed calls and unread messages fly down the inbox. My chest sinks further and further into a bastardised pit of despair, twisting and turning its way into a deformed structure. I feel my stomach lurch back and forth, aching for sustenance with a sharp agonising stretch. 



I can envision my bloodshot eyes; two empty holes surrounded with an electrified red strain of jagged lines. Their function has been endless. 

They then find their way up from the screen, and looking back at them, are Will’s.



For the first time today, perhaps Will could see a glimmer of shine from them.



I take a breath, and ask him, “Okay, what do I say?”



He responds, “Tonight.”
