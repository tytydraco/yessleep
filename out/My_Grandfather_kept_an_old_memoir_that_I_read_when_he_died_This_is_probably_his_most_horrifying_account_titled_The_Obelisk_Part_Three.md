It feels like I've walked for [centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z5p4o1/my_grandfather_kept_an_old_memoir_that_i_read/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) now. This place, this tomb, it's amazing. It's terrifying. It's haunting. It's... It's *fantastic!*

Immediately upon entering, I and the rest of the crew were greeted to a branching network of tunnels that split off into at least four different directions. From there, it was decided that we'd split off into groups of five to enter each of the tunnels. Each group was paired with at least one of the Tri-Nexus advisors, both for supervision and as a source of light, given that everything past the first foot or so was all but invisible. The passages themselves were long, narrow corridors so tight and condensed that the each group was forced to enter them single file. The advisors of course took the lead while the rest of us followed behind.

As each person entered their respective passageway, I watched the darkness greedily swallow them whole. Finally it was my turn, and I remember standing for a brief moment, frozen in terror. I didn't want to go in there, into that fathomless darkness wherein laid one or both of two things, both of which I was certain were pure evil. A long dead, yet perhaps still omniscent and powerful pharaoh, and/or a deranged maniac who's ambition has already driven him to murder once.

What if he was expecting this? What if his plan was for the Tri-Nexus advisors to lure us all in and split us apart to pick us off one by one in the cover of darkness? This also introduced another, possibly more haunting query, what if this *wasn't* Benson's will at all? What if his actions, especially the murder of Rashaad Emahl, were not his own doing, but the influence of another through him?

These were the questions that made my legs feel as though the bones within them had been replaced with rubber as I took a shaky step forward and entered the dark tunnel ahead with the others. For about five or ten minutes following this, all I could see in every direction I turned was complete, absolute blackness. The advisor *had* brought and was using a flashlight, but despite it being an industrial lantern, the illumination it provided was comparable to a firefly trying to illuminate the inside of a small cave in the mountains. Even holding my hands only two inches or less from my face, I still couldn't distinguish and features or outlines of them.

I don't know how long it was when we finally *did* find a source of light from straight ahead. It was a mere speck, a dot, barely piercing the blackness beyond. My group continued into the darkness until we came out into the light, to find that it led to another branching path. One was a sort of stone winding stair that ascended to a point unknown while the latter was a sort of inclined plane that simply went straight down to a shadowy depth. We were forced to split up yet again here.

The advisor and one other chose to take the ascending staircase while I and the other two, one of which I should mention is Ambrose, took the descending path. It was here that something else caused threw us all into a state of frenzy. No sooner than the two taking the winding stair had began their ascent, I began to hear the heartbeat yet again, yet again accompanied by the phrase **"Adrayok Khaa!"** being repeated. Right as the rest of us would've began entry into the descending path, our attention became fixed on the stairs when we heard the sounds of one of the men's screams coming down from the darkness at the top.

Before we could investigate, however, the stone floor beneath us began to shift. Each stone moved, all on its own, it seemed, immediately throwing the three of us off our balance. When we tried to pick ourselves up again, we watched a large slab of stone lower, sealing off the winding stair to any, not allowing for entry or exit. The other two were trapped!

The three of use struggled for a moment in vain after picking ourselves up to attempt lifting the seal door. When we realized this was a futile attempt, we stepped away, where the other man with me and Ambrose, a young graduate student from Harvard by the name of Travis Buckner, huddled into a ball on the floor, trembling violently and muttering incoherently. Seeing this, I was briefly reminded of some of the younger privates back in Saigon who were scared out of their minds like young Travis was here. Ambrose, having only given up on trying to *lift* the door, was trying furiously to batter the stone with his shoulder, as if that would somehow work any better.

I was the only one that remained composed, something perhaps due to my credit from being used to frightening situations, ones far more exhilarating than this. I ordered for Ambrose to cease his attempt and for Bruckner to get to his feet and both to follow me into the descending corridor. They were, perhaps naturally, hesitant and slow at first to follow, but only after walking about a foot or two past the corridor's entrance, I heard the other's footsteps following behind me. Following this, walking deeper and deeper down into the corridor, I heard the shifting of the stones once more.

When we looked back, we found that the stone was lowering over our own path, eventually sealing the three of us once more in complete darkness. This almost caused young Bruckner to panic again until I calmed he and Ambrose down and ordered that we continue forward. We did and had made it another four or five feet, at least that's what I'm guessing, before stopping again when Ambrose called out to me, noting that Bruckner was gone! I turned back.

Without a light, I couldn't see either of the two. I called out Bruckner's name and got no reply. Ambrose told me he'd been right beside him the whole time until only seconds ago. The two of us began scrambling to try and find Bruckner in the dark when a low, droning hum sounded from the other end of the corridor. Looking back, I saw the faint orange glow of torches. Where they'd come from or why they've only *now* appeared, I do not know. I tried calling out again for Bruckner. He didn't respond, though instead, I began to hear the chanting again.

This time, though, I was able to tell, both from the way the chorus echoed  from the walls around us as well as Ambrose's own shocked reaction to it, that this wasn't another hallucination. Someone was down there, doing God only knew what, and God only knew what it meant for poor young Bruckner. With this in mind, I told Ambrose to follow me and the two of us made for the other end of the hall where the chanting was coming from. Reaching the other end, however, we found neither Bruckner, nor anybody else, but instead a large domed chamber that looked impossibly large and spacious, given its outside encasement, with hieroglyphical carvings covering every inch from top to bottom. In the center of the room was the spectacle itself, a large stone Obelisk, likewise covered in pictorial carvings.

In spite of my anxiety, I couldn't help but take a moment to examine the room, to marvel at just how impossibly large it is! This room alone, I felt, could have easily housed an entire congregation of peoples with room still to spare! The sheer fact alone that every square inch of stone making up the room was covered in hieroglyphs amazed me to nearly no end. Imagine the willpower, the determination -- no, the sheer *devotion* \-- those architects must have had all those ages ago when they built this room. The obelisk itself was a crown jewel in of itself, standing easily 15 to 20 feet tall, long and narrow, jutting from the ground as a spear attempting to breach the ceiling. How it hadn't already is a trivial question that persists even as I write this now.

Before I knew it, Ambrose was charging headfirst to call out for Bruckner. I went after him and immediately upon setting foot inside the chamber, before I had any time to react, the doorway shifted and was sealed once again. Ambrose and I were trapped now in that room, trapped with the obelisk. As I write, Ambrose is frantically picking at every corner and every crevice of the room to find a switch or some sort of escape door. I simply sit and wait, and write. Somehow, I feel now that there was a reason Ambrose and I found this room, whereas the others, even that bastard Benson, hadn't. What purpose and to what end, well, only time may tell now.

The passage of time has become increasingly meaningless. Time was only a relative factor before, but here, in this impossible room, hours pass by in what feels like an eternity as well as an instant. I say this to say that it is impossible for me to tell just how long Ambrose and I have been in this room. I know that it's been long enough for the two of us to start suffering of hunger pain.

However long, though, it's still not been enough time to discover and read every pictorial carving within the walls. At one point, I noticed that, from the upper edge of the obelisk's peak, a large portion appeared to be missing. What should be there, I cannot say, for as long as I've spent studying these runes, I cannot deduce any sort of real meaning from them. Even should I have known their translation, though, I've never been able to see the carvings inscribed that far up on the obelisk.

The ones I have been able to see, however are stranger than any hieroglyphs or cave drawings I'd ever before seen. Many of them, particularly inscribed upon the obelisk itself, depicted a strange sort of symbol, one with a circular ring that diverted downward and formed four long points -- perhaps a sort of humanoid figure -- surrounded by an aura, lording over more traditional looking stick figures that wielded what I can only assume to be a weapon of some sort. Admittedly, these I've relatively inferred tp be depictions of the genocidal visions from earlier. The symbol, though humanoid in nature, differs from the stick figures, must obviously represent that horrible pharaoh.

Or that's what I'd first thought. Then I examined further up the shaft of the obelisk to find that this same symbol was depicted in what I inferred to be outer space. In these scenes, I found that the being was shown to be escorted by a handful of these strange, star shaped glyphs. Looking around the room, I found there was indeed more scenes depicting these beings.

In other scenes with the humanoid glyph, I watched it command the skies while men below slew each other senselessly. A few of the glyphs I noticed had the outline of a robe, clearly reminiscent of the robed figures I saw in the vision, carrying away the feral child. These figures, I saw, were drawn in the act of using various methods of bondage and torture upon unfortunate captives, of which one scene depicts a single one to survive the ordeal, to be then taken into their fold.

It is within these carvings in particular that I found the carving of a large castle or tower, one which reflects more of a crude medieval fortress than anything, buried beneath a large mountain of sorts. What mountain it could possibly be, if even a real place here on this Earth, I cannot even begin to infer. Nor can I infer as to why such a thing has gone unnoticed for all this time. Stranger still though were the scenes in which the stick figures were shown half-risen from the ground, as if they themselves were sprouting from the ground the way a plant would. In these, the ground itself appeared as wavy and malleable in a way. Gelatinous, almost.

A sense of familiarity came to me with this. The way in which the ground appeared to ripple like water reminded me of the way in which I watched the soil around all across the Earth transform from sand to living sinew. Could this then be that very same depiction then? Could this crude carving be telling of that vision, that the Earth itself was composed of living flesh? That we as humans are merely the products of this ecological anomaly?

This very thought has given me vertigo ever since it entered my head I know not however long ago. As I write, Ambrose is asleep, though I suspect his rest is anything but peaceful. I can hear him moaning incoherently in his sleep. Faintly, I can hear him muttering something as well, though I can't tell exactly what. I have a horrible feeling it's something to do with this room, though. Something with this place as a whole. Be this the case or not, I pray now only for the exit to be revealed so we can get out of this horrid place. At this point, I'm almost willing to say to hell with any of the rest of the expedition. Let them rot in here for as much as I could care. I just *have* to get out!

Out of sheer exhaustion of my own, I'd fallen asleep as well. When I did, the first thing to accost me was that dreadful chanting again. The slow chorus that slowly built in pitch more and more.

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

Behind these, I could also hear sounds of growling.

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

**"Adrayok aduae Jubbilex..."**

Slowly, the vision began to form. It was the Earth, I was seeing the Earth from space. No, it wasn't merely a vision of the Earth, it was of its *birth!*

I saw the Earth being formed, molded as putty into its familiar shape. As this happened, I saw the Earth and its mass wiggle and writhe to form the ocean and the continents. Once this was completed, I was blinded by a supernatural light. So bright it was that looking directly into it threatened to strip me permanently of my abilities of sight! I could actually *feel* the light searing the flesh from my bones!

From the light, I could hear these words, uttered in a voice that was somehow far more commanding, far more terrifying, than even the pharaoh's was before.

**"From my image, this world was born. For millennia and more, this image has made the world thrive. For millennia, flesh has been corrupted because of you!"**

*What is it talking about?!* I wondered while the light continued to burn brighter and brighter. I wondered, too, exactly who -- or rather *what* \-- was speaking as I was certain this was not the voice of any person.

Suddenly, something inside myself came out. It was almost like a dormant instinct, one that I couldn't possibly describe other than to say that it wasn't myself that spoke, but rather something else *through* me! whatever it was, being or instinct, it spoke in a raspy, snakelike voice, *"IIII hhhhaaaaavvve cccooooommeee tttoooo maaaakee iiitt aaaallll eeeeennnd!"*

When I spoke -- when *it* spoke -- I was seemingly brought out of my body. My senses and the actions of my body weren't my own. The only faculties I still possessed control of were those of my thoughts. For this, my energy was spent trying to rack my mind around what it even was that I was witnessing, why, and who it was that spoke to me and what his words meant. I was a fish in a bowl, a bird in a cage, forced to stay in confinement while forces far beyond my comprehension seemed to do with me as they damned well pleased.

From my mouth, the snakelike voice spoke again, *"Yyyyoooouu hhhaaaavvvvee llliiiieeed ttoooo yyyoooouurrrrsssssseelf! Wwwweeeee aaalll hhhaaaavvvveee lllliiiieeeed tttoooo ooourrrrsssssseelveessss! Thhhheeeerrrreee isssss noooo peeeeaaaccccccee, nnoooo prrooooosssssspeerrriitttyyy! Thheee sssstaaarr wiiillll haaaavve ussss aaalllll!"*

To this, the thunderous voice bellowed, **"You're the only one that draws it to us! YOU are why our peoples were damned! YOU! I am the one that's saving us all! Through rebirth, I cleanse this world of corruption like you!"**

*"Rrreeebiirrth?"* I heard the other hiss condescendingly. *"Rrreeeebirrrthh wiiilll nooot ssssaaavve yyyyyoooouuu! IIII sssssaaww tthheee trrruuutthh whhheeeen IIII waaaassss nnnuuulllled!"*

Following this, I watched the aura of light dissipate to reveal the vomitile looking being within. Tall, slender and grotesque it was, without sexual organs, without skin, and most horrifyingly, without a *face!* All across its body, the being had no flesh to cover a single inch of the at least seven to eight feet of muscle tissue and sinew that made up its form. Its head, however, was a completely different story altogether, with it being made *entirely* out of scraps of flesh that constantly writhed and pulsed in a rhythm similar to a heartbeat.

I had absolutely no control over my body, else I likely would've screamed and ran faster than I ever had in my life. The gruesome being outstretched its gangly, naked arm out towards me. My body retracted away, though not of my own command. From my mouth the snake voice hissed, *"Yyyyoooouuu ccccaaaannnnoooottt bbeeee rrriiiddd ooofff meeee! Thheee tttiiiimmmee ccoooommeesssss fooorr aaalll thhiiiinnngsssssss ttoooo eeennd!"*

**"Flesh will live on!"** roared the being. This time, I could swear there was an air of desperation in its words. A sense, perhaps, of fear!

*"Nnnnoooooo! Fleeeesssshhh mmuuuussst eeennnd, juuuussssst aaasssss theee reeeessst!"*

Following these words, a shadow formed behind the horrid being. Gargantuan and wiggling, this shadowed mass appeared behind the figure, revealing a large violet glowing maw in its center that blinded me worse than the horrific being's aura had before. The being's misshapen head pulsed more and more vigorously at this. *"Thhheeee ssssstaaarr wiiillll coooommme, jusssst asssss iiitt diiid lllooonng agoo! IIII caaaann fffeeeel iiitt. IIIt'sss hheeeeaarrd myyyy caaalll!"*

The shadow drew closer and closer to the being. The glow from its center burned brighter, hotter, the closer it came. I watched then as everything around it was drawn into it, sucked in and devoured, ceasing to exist. The being's head pounded viciously now, to a degree that I was sure it would explode!

*"Yyyoooouuu knnnooow it'ssss trrruuuueeee!"* the voice hissed again. It was then that I sensed an air of satisfaction in the tone. A sense of triumph in the revelation, as if it were proud to be telling this being that the Earth was facing imminent doom at the whim of whatever this monstrosity was, this "Star" as he kept referring it as. *"Yyyyouuuu ffeeeeelll iiittt toooo, III caaaannn sssseeeee yyyooourrrr ffffeeeeeaarrrr!"*

**"I have no fear"** roared the being defiantly. **"The world will live through rebirth! Through MY image, the image of flesh! All will thrive through rebirth!"**

*"Nnnnnoooo! Eeeeevvvvvveeerrryyyythhiiiing muuuussssssst eeennd! Fleeeesssh, lliiiifffe, rrreeeeaalityyy, iiit aaaalll muuuussst eeennd! Rrrreeebirrrrthhh issss oonnlyyy a liiieeee!"*

At this, the colossal shadow proceeded to devour the Earth and everything around it. In an instant, I watched the entirety of the cosmos be consumed greedily whole, never to be seen again. *"Thheeee sssstaaaarr wiiiillll haaaavvvee ussss aaallll, aaannd tthhheeerreee'ssss nnooo ssssaaavinng yyyooouu!"* The voice ended this with a devious, raspy sort of chuckle before everything faded completely. That was when I awoke again, sweating and panting profusely.

For a good 10-15 minutes, I sat, throwing my head wildly around the room. Once I was sure that I was both alive and fully conscious, both of body and mind, I looked up once more at the obelisk. A further ways up, closer to the peak, I spotted a new icon, one that took the shape of an eight sided sort of star with a large dot or hole directly in its center. Some of these, I saw shapes depicted as descending from it, the other five sided star shapes I saw before with the humanoid icon.

In other carvings, particularly the ones closest to the peak of the obelisk, I saw scenes evidently depicting this eight-sided shape to travel the stars. Everywhere it went, I saw that everything appeared to be swallowed whole, just as I'd seen in my dream (If it *were* merely a dream -- I'm honestly not sure anymore). Seeing this, I cannot help but wonder not only who or what that was that spoke through me as a conduit, not only who or what the grotesque being I saw before me was, but above all else, what *was* this gargantuan terror that had these beings terrified to death? Questions like these are the sort that'd make any man, even some of the most hardened of soldiers back in Vietnam, shake in bed at night trying to wrap their heads around. They were the sort that'd make even the most educated professors realize just how little they really know of life itself. How little they could *ever* know of life itself.

And because of this, men as such would lose their minds completely. So much that is being shown to me, so much that was formerly unknown, now being pushed into the light, and yet to still be left with so little to no answers at all. Yes, this is madness itself, and I fear I will be no exception to it's crippling hold.
