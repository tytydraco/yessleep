The control room had a bluish, dark hue, ideal for relaxing and letting the mind wander. But nothing could be further from the truth.  
John Walkins, the only one still awake on the vast Andromeda ship, gazed at the room with a mix of despair and discouragement. For now, he could only embrace his solitude, powerless to pilot the ship and fulfill the mission that had been entrusted to him and his now sleeping crew.

  
He sat down on one of the sofas in the main hall. Since he had plenty of time, he slowly surveyed the room in its entirety: the board games on the shelf that he and his companions had enjoyed so much, the coffee maker that everyone except Michael used every morning—Michael was totally abstinent, even from caffeine—as well as the televisions where they would gather to watch the main national and international channels, which also served for communication with the control center over 200 million kilometers away.

  
After finishing the only sugary soda allowed by NASA for astronauts, which was specially manufactured for missions, he rose from the comfortable futuristic sofa and headed to the rooms where his crewmates slept forever.

  
Wrapped in the shadows of the ship's hallways, he made his way to the room of his best friend, Michael. The heavy, sleek doors opened automatically as he approached.

  
The infinite vastness of the universe greeted him in the absence of his friend. Michael was (and still is, though asleep forever) a philologist specializing in xeno-linguistics, crucial for deciphering the language of new species humanity encountered during its journey and exploration of the universe after the recent discovery of zero-gravity engines, which minimized the time needed to traverse billions of kilometers.  
Sleep had overtaken everyone but him. It all began after that scouting mission to the planet designated X2-6434/5L, which had previously unknown plant life, though no dangers for exploration according to prior reports and the ship's systems. John was the only one who didn’t descend to the planet’s surface, as plant life didn’t particularly interest him (he was one of the engineers on the ship), and someone had to stay in charge in case anything happened.

  
He still remembers the conversation he had with Michael after he returned from the planet’s surface:

*“It was such a welcoming planet, it felt like those trees were embracing you with their huge, vibrant leaves. It was as if I had seen them as a child; I felt an odd familiarity with them.”*  
*“That sounds really interesting. Was there anything else of note?”*  
*“The other crewmates, mostly the geologists, collected some interesting rocks that floated. Yes, John, they floated on their own planet.”*  
*“Well, is that normal? Especially on planets this far away. After all, we’re outside the solar system.”*  
*“Thanks for your enthusiasm, my friend.”* (laughs) “They also found an elongated rock that they say could resemble a deity, though, of course, we don’t know. To me, it just looks like another rock with some intriguing erosion patterns, nothing more.”\_  
*“See? That sounds more interesting. When I get the chance, I’ll go check it out.”*

As he recalled, with sadness, his last conversation with his friend, he also remembered that he never went to see that stone—what some considered a local deity, and others, like Michael, just a rock.  
He headed to the storage room. The loneliness he felt walking through such a colossal structure, once so full of life, began to chill his blood. When he reached the storage area, he sensed that something wasn’t right—or, at least, that something wasn’t normal.

  
As the storage doors slid open, he immediately spotted the supposed rock Michael had mentioned. Though it was placed on an ordinary shelf like any other object, all his senses zeroed in on that unidentified chunk of stone. It held power, and it definitely had something to do with what was happening on the Andromeda—of that, there was no doubt. Suddenly, he felt exhausted. An overwhelming need to lie down overtook him, and he collapsed on the floor of the storage room, instantly falling asleep.

  
In his dream, he saw Michael. He wasn’t dreaming *of* him, he was seeing him. He didn’t know why, but that was the feeling the dream conveyed. Michael was in the exact same bed where John had seen him minutes before, in what seemed to be his eternal slumber.

*“I’m here, John. Can’t you see me?”*  
*“I see you, but you’re asleep.”*  
*“I’M HERE! I wish you were here with me.”*  
*“I wish I were with someone. I’m alone, all alone on this ship. I need…”*  
*“Come with us! Touch the statue and enjoy eternal bliss.”*

John woke up. It had been a long dream, and he awoke in a panic. Immediately, he headed to Michael’s bed.  
What he saw froze his blood: his friend was asleep, but a monstrous, ear-to-ear grin was plastered across his face—permanent. It was so exaggerated and false that the muscles in his mouth had started bleeding from the pressure. He must have been like that for hours.

  
Realizing what that smile meant, John’s mind plunged into the endless plains that eventually lead to the abyss of madness.  
Humanity, with its eternal arrogance and sense of superiority, had believed it understood the universe, creation, everything and nothing, navigating its tiny fishbowl convinced it had mastered it all.

  
What those bipedal beings didn’t and never would know was that the very core of existence itself was so unfathomable, so inconceivable to them, that life itself didn’t even glance back at them—they were that insignificant.

  
Life and death were terms invented by humanity, only applicable within their own limited perception of what they considered “life.” On that ship, the rock those bipeds thought was just a geological element had decided to show them, beings it regarded as little more than animals, a small glimpse of the true nature of reality—a glimpse they could not bear. Hence their catatonic state, which didn’t bring death but something far worse: non-life.

  
Infinite torrents of true reality coursed through the neural connections of the ship’s unfortunate crew, by the whim, rational or not, of someone or something that had, perhaps in an act of goodwill, decided to share what it knew.

  
John knew he didn’t need to see the other crewmates aboard the ship—he knew they’d all be in the same state as his friend Michael. He gazed out the window. The stars of the infinite universe seemed to understand and pity him. He slowly and heavily walked to his own room, right next to his best friend’s.

  
The boundaries of the ship began to blur in his mind. He struggled to grasp concepts that until now had been so clear, like work, salary, friends, family… He felt the previously cold, unyielding darkness of the universe become warmer, more welcoming.

  
He tried to sit on one of the room’s bunks, but all he managed was to collapse onto the floor. His senses no longer responded as they had the day before. His body shook, his hands trembled, and he felt his being, his soul, trying to escape the prison of his anatomy, to merge with the unknown, with whatever waited outside.  
The last thing that crossed John’s mind was his eternal sense of loneliness after losing his parents as a child. He had never found meaning in such a tragedy.

  
As the madness of reality flooded his entire being, he felt them, for just a moment, before letting go and abandoning the empty shell his body had become.

**EPILOGUE**  
After two months without responding to radio signals from spaceports, a police patrol finally boarded the Andromeda, only to find all its occupants in an inexplicable deep coma.  
The police forces searched every room, one by one, and the incident was ultimately attributed to contaminated material from an unknown planet, which had caused the crew’s condition and then dissipated—something not uncommon in those early days of space exploration.  
When the officers entered the storage room, they found an overwhelming mess and an elongated rock that didn’t catch their attention. In fact, they didn’t even mention it in their subsequent report.  
They were lucky. That day, the universe had no interest in teaching anyone anything.
