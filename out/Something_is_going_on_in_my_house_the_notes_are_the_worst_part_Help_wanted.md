someone is leaving notes around my house- they’re getting weird.  

I don’t want to get too much into my life but I guess I need to talk about some of it. I don’t post much. My work as a freelance editor finally became stable enough that I could buy my own place to live. I was going to rent at first, but I live right by this old suburban neighborhood that’s sort of falling apart and decided to bite the bullet and buy. 

It's a Levittown. I read about that in a magazine somewhere. Back in the 50s they made hundreds of suburbias along highways and outside big cities, all identical. A whole lot of them are abandoned now or in some state of disrepair. This place, Wallace Street, is halfway to ruin. Only a third of the houses are inhabited- now I’m a part of that third.

Frankly the house is a piece of crumbling shit. It’s one of those low-down suburban houses with crumbling plaster, the inside smells like a dog threw up and died here, there’s stains from where mold used to be, and the floor is always damp. But in this economy owning a house at my age is near impossible, I’m not giving it up because of some bugs that are plastered into the wall. Landlord special. 

Anyway, I’ve been fixing this house up for a while and it’s actually pretty nice now. There’s one room I still don’t go into- it’s where the worst of the mold is and the air is literally thick with mildew. I just threw a couple of dehumidifiers in there and called it a day. The house is nice and liveable and there’s only a few problems. 

The aforementioned wet-room is one of them, but  I’m not using it anyway. Once it’s dry I’ll convert it into an office. The other is a stain on the floor that won’t go away. I tried putting a shag carpet over it but I had to throw that away because the stain went through the carpet. Maybe it’s some kind of oil? There’s also a leak coming down from the ceiling and noises up in the attics- raccoons live around here and if I find out that racoon piss is coming down into my living room I might actually have an aneurysm. it’s what got my father so it might as well get me as well.

I’ve been living here for about a month and I’m sure I’ve missed a whole lot of issues. I keep finding new things. The shower upstairs sprays black water, had to call the plumber- he told me he couldn’t do anything because there were no pipes in that bathroom. 

The weirdest part is the notes, I don’t know what it means. I found it in the mailbox the day I moved in and I’m worried it’s a stalker or some teenage prank. I found the first note the week I moved in, it’s on yellowed journalism paper and it reeks of skunk or weed- more credence to the teenagers theory. 

The handwriting is loopy and elegant but shaky around the end of sentences. It reminds me of how people say cyanide tastes like almonds and cherries. It’s sweet. 

I’ve copied it down:
— 
There are bugs in the walls. They twist, and shiver, and dance their mindless dance.
These bugs arent important to the story, or to the women who inhabit it. Old houses have bugs in the same way that old houses have people- they’re all active decomposers.

Tear down that wall.

Paint this one beige- it matches the carpets now.

These fireplaces are so out of style.

Old houses are knocked down into brick buildings. When they come back into style, brick buildings will be knocked down into old houses. Constantly changing, and shifting just enough to look new- but no matter how new they look, they can’t escape the infestations.  Foundation brick and stone and hammer and nail and the clink and clink and clink of hammer on ground is how all of Wallace street was built. Clink. Clink. Clink.

What. The. Fuck. 

Maybe it’s one of the old squatters in this place who’s mad I bought it? Teenagers would make sense because of the weed stench, but why would a teen write this? It’s not directly threatening it’s just…wrong. It feels old. The edges of the paper are crumbling.

 There’s more that’s happened in the past month but I think I just heard something break upstairs. I’ve got to go. I’ll update in a couple days. Anyone who knows anything about home safety please let me know what I can do about my plumbing problems. Maybe the stain has to do with the bad pipes? Bye.

EDIT: 
The thing that broke upstairs was an old radio. I didn’t own a radio- where the hell did this come from?
