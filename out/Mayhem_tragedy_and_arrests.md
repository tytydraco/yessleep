Personal story from my days before recovery from addiction.

It started out as some escapism. A little weed, a little bit of coke. And then things took a scary turn. I met this dealer from my home town, where I still live. He set me up with crizzack and was my only connect for a while. 

He introduced me to someone he wanted me to meet. The devil incarnate, and she's a facesnatcher. The person she used to be ..was someone with a story of tragedy. She had a daughter very young, during some sober years where she was off of a teenage addiction to painkillers. Oxy. Perc. She had her girl and raised her for a few years. Then her baby daddy died and she lost it. She lost herself. She moved and started tricking.

Here's where it gets weird. We used to be just buddies and smoked together. Then she left some fent around my apartment, and I almost died. I'm not sure to this day if I'm alive or living in a dream somewhere...playing out my life as it could have or should have been if I didn't meet her. 

She moved in her friends, did tricks in my apartment, and slept with her ex in my very own bed. While I was recovering in the hospital. See, I bought all the lies she told me. She used me for money to buy drugs. She bought more drugs than a human should ever be able to do. 

And she tried to bl@kma!l me. On mother's Day. She called her parents and her daughter, locked herself in a spare bedroom and started screaming. I filmed the whole thing and told her I was calling the cops.

She moved her friends into my apartment and tried to gaslight me into thinking it was my decision. When is lock them out, they'd steal stuff from the basement, smoke down there, get geeked, climb on the roofs to try to get into my apartment through a screened window. My landlord found out about everything and people were taking pictures of what they did around the property.

Her friends stayed in my apartment and wouldn't leave. Id come by to pick her up to go score. Shed leave me in the car with no money no gas just a coat and a pipe, promising me she'd bring me a hit if I just waited while she did a date at different motels up and down the strip. Id sit around freezing and dehydrated, all for a hit.

She left me in a bad part of town while her ex drove her around, promised me shed bring me 80 bucks cash. I had to sell personal items out of my trunk for gas, cigs and water. People were asleep in my car, and when I tried to get them out, they wouldn't respond or acknowledge me. They would slam the door shut when I tried to get people out of the car. They'd try locking the car from the inside and I'd pump the button on my key fob repeatedly to try to pull the door open. Then they'd come swinging.

See, junkies get mixed up with all sorts of mental unstable people.and she led me into a world of tortured stories and realities of people who'd sold their souls for a slice. I was just in it for the crizzack, not into other drugs. But this crazy lunatic hoebag would get into abandoned buildings, guys would come pouring out the doors of abandoned motel rooms when I showed up. Shed be half asleep or half naked. She was convinced everywhere and everything was bugged. 

She got jumped one day at knifepoint on a back street near a common spot, and I locked the doors and crouched low in the driver's seat watching this unfold in front of me. All over reputation and a few bags. Or some unpaid debts. 

I've hidden in bathrooms while dates go on, I've been at the bottom of a tub with the curtain drawn when the date uses the bathroom. People squatting on dead people's houses in nice neighborhoods. Women walking around naked in their house to pass you a hit when you're low and they're waiting for the next thing.


It's not the ride of a lifetime. But when you're in the car and listening to music and joking and smoking and getting high a few times a day, it feels almost worth it.


Ive been 95% clean for the last year. I don't go back to those spots anymore ...but those spots know me. I'm lucky I'm alive. I'm not sure I really am alive because I od'd on the only opiate I've ever touched outside of a hospital, and I'm not sure or remember the details of how I survived. 

The devil is a single mom turned into a junkie and a whore. She installs rootkits on their phones. She accesses hidden menus on their phone. She records her friends and spins a story about how she got out of dodge when the driver she's with gets arrested. She sleeps with different guys and does unbelievable amounts of drugs. She pulls knives on people. She calls her parents crying wolf to try to get her way through coercion and manipulations, including bl@ckma!l. Shell steal your car and go up and down the strip shoplifting to try to get your license plate photod. 

She smokes in bathrooms. She's a demon. And she'll randomly show up on your porn search results. She's a lunatic and she's the one beneath whatever demon managed to facesnatch her and keeps her addicted and lieing and running from the law, not to mention her responsibilities.

She's a psycho.
