 

I stumbled across this on 4chan just know that OP refers to the original poster not me i'm trying to recreate the conversation I found

OP:When I was a kid there was this show with an animal resembling a weasel dressed as a pirate and he and his crew would go on adventures. First of all, no I do not remember which program or channel had it. I will ask some of my friends and my brother to see what they remember. I just remember the pirate weasel and his first mate, a crocodile dressed as a pirate along with other characters I don't quite remember. 

ONE DAY LATER

Drake234:I believe I am aware of what you are referring to and the weasels name was Wilbert but they called him willy throughout the show and the crocodile was named Carl I think there was also a cat named Katrina and a dog named Dan and these two characters often fought and willy would step in and stop them. I think there was also a villain. I don't remember his name but he was a bat and he had a helper who I think was a rabbit and he was often mean to the rabbit. Willy always said he would never forgive the bat for what he did and I don’t know if we ever found out or if it was revealed in one of the episodes I missed. But yeah that’s all I know. 

OP:Oh yeah I remember the bat now he was creepy and I don't remember an explanation of why willy hates the bat either although i did miss some episodes and my memory sucks at times. I will be talking to one of my childhood friends in about an hour. Whenever he arrives I will try to ask him about the show and see what he knows.

OP:I just talked to my friend and he said that he can’t believe I don’t remember more about the show. He said that the show got so big that they did an event in our home town where you would drop your kids off and they would do all sorts of stuff with them so that they could interact with the characters it was a lot of fun now that I think about it I can’t believe that I forgot about it however, my friend got a little uncomfortable when he was talking about it so I pressed him and he said “do you remember that weird kid Ethan?” I said “Oh yeah the kid who always sat alone at lunch did he move or something?” My friend waited a second then said “Dude, he went missing that day while at the event”. I replied by saying something like really or stop messing with me but he just changed the subject. I would try to circle back to it but he wouldn’t say more. Idk this seems weird. I'll ask some of my other friends and see what they know about it.

Drake234: Wait a minute… Did you live in Lynn Massachusetts as a kid?

OP:No I lived in Lowell Massachusetts why?

Drake234:That’s where I grew up and something similar happened where some kid who also had no friends just disappeared at the event for the show.

OP:That's weird, is it possible the show was only in Massachusetts or something?

Drake234: That’s possible but it's also weird that kids disappeared at both of the events that we know of.

TWO DAYS LATER

Sirsun: I also had one of these events and something happened there too

OP: You’re joking right?

Sirsun: No

Drake234: Let me guess a kid went missing too?

Sirsun: for a little bit yea but they found him somewhat

OP:?

Drake234:?

Sirsun: They found his body along the edge of a river nearby he was missing all sorts of organs and was stabbed so many f\*\*\*ing times

Drake234:wait where did you live

Sirsun: Springfield Massachusetts

OP: well as much as im creeped out at least we do know that the show seemed to be exclusive to massachusetts

SIX HOURS LATER

OP: Guys my friend that I talked about was just found dead a couple miles away from his apartment and he was stabbed 21 times and was ripped open and missing organs

Drake234: …

OP: that's not all on the wall next to him written in blood it said something about Willy idk the cops wouldn’t tell me they just asked if I knew who Willy might be

Sirsun:HOLY SH\*\* DUDE

Drake234:wtf

OP:I KNOW RIGHT THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HIS DEATH AND SIRSUN’S MISSING KID STORY ARE SO SIMILAR ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A MESSAGE ABOUT WILLY.

Drake234: calm down man maybe it's a coincidence

OP:oh no

Drake234:...

Sirsun:?

OP: I just went to get some water and the window in my kitchen was open

Sirsun: So?

OP: I have never opened that window once since I moved in 

Op:I heard something in my closet 

Sirsun: calm down I’m sure its nothing

Drake234: is he okay

Sirsun: I'm not sure this is either real or some sick prank I can do some digging to see if I cn find out

Drake234 ok

1 day later

Sirsun: Okay now listen, don't ask how I got this information but I found out his name was Jim Kaydence and I googled his name and found he was killed. He was found in a nearby factory stabbed at least 20 times, ripped open and missing organs.

Drake234: ur joking right?

Sirsun: no

Drake 234: HOLY SH\*\*

Sirsun: ikr

Drake234:NO NOT THAT I JUST LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SAW SOME DUDE DRESSED AS WILLY FROM THE SHOW STARING AT ME

Sirsun:no f\*\*\*ing way

Drake234: Im calling the cops

Drake234: I’m gonna keep you updated I want you to tell the cops to try to do something in case something happens

Sirsun: Ok

Sirsun: Drake?

Sirsun:Drake

Drake234: Spread what you know to others or we will find your family and we will feast on them like we feasted on Jim and Carl and all the others we have killed.

Dear readers I must apologize to you but they threatened my family.
