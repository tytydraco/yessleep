What’s it called when you’re addicted to people who are terribly bad for your mental health? I’ve known this girl for almost 5 years now and we’ve dated and broken up probably more than 20 times and I just keep getting drawn back to her, she’s so beautiful and sweet, I can’t stop loving her, every time she breaks up with me it’s either for another man, because she can’t be with me, or just for no fucking reason. She’s even broken up with me for my younger brother, but every time she comes back to me I can’t help but try and sweet talk her, get with her, anything to talk to her, I can’t help it, I know she’s bad for me and my mental health but there is just something so attractive about her and her problems n shit, y’know? When I first met her she would cut herself and for all I know still does to this day, I’d always beg her to stop and promise me to stop, she had issues with family, her father had raped her when she was a kid, dudes locked up behind bars now for kidnapping her mom and her moms friend, he killed her moms friend and was in a standoff with cops in his trailer for hours, that ruined her, i tried to comfort the best of my ability, it was never enough, I can’t even type all of this right, I’m just spouting off at this point, she would get into fights at school with people and eventually got sent to a all girls school in Greenville county Tennessee or whatever the fuck it’s called, she was gone for so long I actually started forgetting about her, she was gone for probably a year and at the school they give you day passes every so often and this is recent like the last year but about a month or two ago she texted me and all those feelings flooded again, we go to talking and I only fell in love more and more from then on, she recently got out like this week and we’re talking again even dating but besides the point during that time she was talking about some of her exes she dumped me for and how she missed them and my jealousy rushed in so hard, I felt angry, betrayed even, I felt sad, my jealousy over came me and I wrote up something, went along the lines of “and bro get this the worst thing about it is that she said she loved him” there was more but I barley remembered that part, I was so overcome with jealousy that I wrote that to play as I was trying to send it to my friend but sent it to her, I would wait for her to open it and then quickly “realize” it wasn’t my friend and in fact her letting her read enough of it and deleting it, back to current time we just started dating yesterday and she’s already acting strange, she started crying earlier and didn’t wanna hear shit from me, she was crying about her dad, wanted a lousy fucking letter or some shit, crying about her deadbeat child predatorial rapist dad, fucking hated the dude, I dont even know why I typed all this shit, I guess I needed to vent I guess? Less of venting I guess and just yapping, it feels wrong to joke around with this, yapping felt like the best word idk, I feel like I need a reality check something to help me realize I need to get over this girl and block her, I know it’ll prollly never come taht or I’d ignore it and continue down this path, I’m so confused right now, help
