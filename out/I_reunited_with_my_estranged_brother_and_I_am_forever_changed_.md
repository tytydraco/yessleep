My younger brother Scott had always been the black sheep of the family. He was hanging around bad influences, and even got a month suspension for drugs in high school. My parents tried desperately to change his behavior. He spent more time grounded than not, and they even threatened him with military school. I tried to be there for him, but he was always cold and distant. When we graduated college, he didn’t want to stick around. The last time I saw him was on Christmas, he didn’t speak or even look at my parents the whole time. They didn’t get him anything either. After that he took his car and drove out west before cutting contact with everyone. I never stopped missing him, and I always prayed every night that he’d find the right path. 

A few years past, and my mom passed from lung cancer just a few months before I graduated college. Her condition and death sent my dad into a depression, and he turned to drinking. He drank himself to the grave just a few years after that. The loss of my parents was hard, and all I could think about was how I wanted my brother here to help. I wondered if he knew, or even cared, given how he never had a good relationship with our parents. 

Ten years had passed since I last saw Scott, and things hadn’t gotten much better for me. My wife of five years had turned out to be having an affair, leaving me alone and heartbroken. I was struggling financially, having trouble holding down jobs, and suffering from alcohol abuse just my father had. However, the light did shine down on me, and one day I received a letter from Scott. I was in disbelief, my brother who cut contact a decade ago was now reaching out to me. The letter read as follows:

“Dear Avery, it is me, your brother, Scott. I know it has been long, and we parted not on the best terms. As such, I want to repay you, as I have sensed your heartbreak, your turmoil, and your dipsomania. I reach out my hand as invitation into the new family which has granted me great comfort and courage when I too was struggling and directionless. Please accept my offer, and we kin will be reunited again under its glorious radiance. 
-Your brother, Scott”

The message struck me as a bit odd at first. It was a while since I talked to him, but I knew he didn’t talk like that. But something in me chose only to look past it. I couldn’t describe it, but I felt like I was being saved, that this letter would be what saves my life. I checked the address on the envelope, which was five states away. Something was pulling me, guiding me, and I couldn’t ignore it. So I scraped up as much money as I could and took a one way trip to see my brother once more. Deep in my gut I knew, the glorious radiance was guiding me. 

After a grueling trip I had arrived at the address. I stood before a giant iron gate, and through the bars I could see several small buildings, with one big building in the center. between them was only grass and trees, with no visible paths or roads. I could see people wearing pure white robes traversing between the buildings. A small group approached the gate, and leading them was my brother Scott.

Scott too wore a white robe, he had always been skinny, but now he was gaunt, and so was everyone else there. They also had really dark circles around their eyes, as if nobody had slept in days. I couldn’t help but be put off by their appearance, but soon I would see how blind I was.

“Welcome to our paradise brother.” Scott greeted me. I could barely let out a word before I hurried over and hugged him. Wrapping my arms around him really let me feel how thin he was, as he wrapped his bony arms around my neck. 

We stood there talking about the past ten years, how we were holding up, how good it was to see each other after so long. Scott told me these people took him in after he had found himself wandering aimlessly around the country, how they offered him everything he needed, and how he knew I needed them too. 

“How did you know I needed help? We haven’t spoken in so long?” I asked 
“The light showed me, told me that I must find you, that it would save you like it saved me.”

I was confused, I had no idea what he was talking about, frankly I thought it was damn freaky. I had known about groups like this, but I was ignorant, and deep down I knew this was the true path I needed to take. I accepted their offer, and they closed the gate behind me.

I followed them further into the compound as they lead me to their leader. I saw many people in prayer circles, chanting in the radiant hymns that I would have the great privilege of learning. Standing in the center of a large circle was the Voice of Radiance. His robe was white with golden trims and reached down to the ground, covering his feet. he wore a large hood, and under the hood was a blank golden mask. The other members knew to bow before him, and I followed suit. 

“So you have brought another whom seeks the warmth of the glorious radiance. Who is he, I must ask?” He said, his voice muffled but no less powerful.

“He is my brother, Oh great voice, the great light showed me his strife, and has guided him here.” Scott spoke, only raising his head and nothing more.

The Voice turned to me, even from behind the golden mask, his gaze commanded me to rise.

“Child in darkness, tell me, do you wish to be embraced by the Glorious Radiance? To know its hymns and execute its will?”

I rose to my feet, “I do.”

“Rise, followers of the light! Tonight we perform the severance!” The Voice demanded, raising his arms into the air, I knew there was no going back.

For my initiation, they performed a ritual called “the severance”. In the severance, one must discard all their belongings, and incinerate them. This ensures that the one who chooses to live in the light can enjoy its splendor without burden. They had me take my clothes off, as long with anything in my pockets, my wallet, my phone, my house and keys, everything. 

“Are you ready to be unburdened? To be free? To the know the light, and only the light? To care for the light, and only the light?” The Voice of Radiance asked me.

“Yes! With all my heart!” I shouted. With my confirmation, they tossed my things into the pyre. The fire burned hotter, the warmth spreading over my naked body as I took in my newfound weightlessness. Soon, two other members draped me in another one of the pure white robes, and I knew the light had found my salvation. 

The next few weeks were agonizing, but everything was worth it. We ate as little as possible, consisting only on meager amounts of rice and beef. We must not weigh down ourselves with food, to be weightless is to weigh as little as you can.

We slept as little as possible, only taking one day out of each week to rest. No time could be wasted, and sleep is the biggest waste of time there is. for 24 hours, we spent memorizing the intricate radiant hymns. 

One day my brother approached me, the Voice of Radiance with him. He told me that I was now ready to witness the light directly. I nearly broke into tears, the honor was unimaginable, I accepted the privilege wholeheartedly.

They lead me to the largest building. I followed them down a long hallway. All the walls were painted pitch black, before I reached the grand chamber of Glorious Radiance. It was a large circular chamber with walls painted vantablack, with dozens of members all praying, reciting the sacred hymns. In the center, hovering just above the floor, was the Glorious Radiance itself. I shined like the sun, but shielded one’s eyes from it was forbidden. It emitted a high pitched ringing, which the Voice of Radiance would interpret into the hymns of radiance.

A group of members also came in, restraining another member. He had been conspiring to leave, to tell the authorities what was going on here, of course we could not let him. He was brought directly before the light, the ringing growing louder than before. 

“He is a damn traitor! He was going to abandon us! Abandon the glorious light!” They said. 

The Voice of Radiance approached, and everyone waited in silence for him to speak the light’s will. 

“You commit a grave transgression child, I pity you for being so blind, even after bathing in the light’s glorious radiance. The light has spoken, you must know the light more intimately, to become light, so that you stray not the path again.” 

The traitor looked up at the light, and it shined brightly on him. But he could not handle the radiance, his skin and eyes began to smoke, and the light burned him. He screamed as the light unleashed its warm and loving wrath upon him. He caught flame, the fire from his body glowing just as bright as the light. He couldn’t scream anymore, and soon he was ashes. The traitor became one with the light, and rejoiced we did. 

It has been a few weeks since I became one with the glorious radiance, and now my message must be shared. Soon the light will encompass all, but I beg the question. Will you be embraced, or burn?
