We arrived at camp one day before the kids.

It was one of those forgotten summer camps somewhere in the northern states — too far out for cell reception, too quiet for anyone to just wander by. On the map, it was barely a dot near a lake, surrounded by thick pine forest.

But at first… it felt kind of magical.

The pines cracked softly in the wind. The lake shimmered under the evening sun. The old wooden cabins smelled like damp wood and something close to freedom. It was my first time working as a counselor, and for the first few days, I felt like a kid again — like this was a place where nothing bad could ever happen.

The kids arrived the next day.
We spent the first few days learning names, making dumb team flags, singing by the fire, playing games that didn’t make sense but made everyone laugh.

It was all good.

Until one of the other counselors said something strange.

“Hey… don’t you ever feel like someone’s watching us?”

It was the fourth day. I thought they were joking and laughed — but they didn’t. They were standing by the edge of the trees, staring into the woods like they were trying to make out a shape in the dark.

“I saw someone yesterday. And again today. Right there — near the old footbridge. Just… standing.”

I looked. Nothing but trees and shadow.

“Maybe a hunter?” I asked.
“Maybe not,” they said.

We moved on, but after that, I started glancing back at the woods a lot more often.
And at night, walking back to my cabin, I started listening for footsteps that shouldn’t be there.


In a few days, one of the kids said something strange.

He was maybe eight years old. Quiet. The kind of kid who speaks in a whisper even when everything’s fine.

He came up to me during free time. The other boys were throwing pinecones at each other, but he wasn’t playing. He was just standing there, hands in his hoodie pockets, looking pale.

“There was a man outside our window last night,” he said.

I crouched down, half-expecting a joke. “What kind of man?”

He shrugged. “He was tall. Just… standing. I think he was smelling.”

“Smelling?”

“Yeah,” he said. “Like, breathing on the glass. I saw the fog.”

I stared at him for a moment.

“Why didn’t you tell anyone?”

“I did. I told the other counselor. He said not to make stuff up. So I went back to sleep.”

I asked which cabin.

He pointed to the farthest one — the one closest to the trees.

That night, I sat on the porch outside that cabin until after midnight. Nothing moved. Nothing stirred.

But the next morning, one of the kitchen staff found a muddy footprint just outside the cabin window.
A big one.

I told the camp director what the kid had said.

The director was hard to surprise. One of those clipboard-and-coffee types who looked like he’d seen a hundred summers and could handle a hundred more.

He listened carefully, then sighed.
“Alright,” he said. “Let’s call the sheriff. Just to be safe.”

The sheriff showed up sometime after lunch. Tanned face, mustache, slow voice. His eyes were always slightly squinted, like he was either deep in thought or just didn’t really buy what we were saying.

We stood with him by the mess hall.

“You really think someone’s walking around out here?” he asked. “It’s nearly forty miles to the nearest town. Nothing out here but trees and mountains.”

I told him about the footprint. About the boy who saw a face in the window.

The sheriff shrugged.

“Look… as long as this camp’s been running, there’s never been a single report. No disappearances. No assaults. No bodies.”

He wasn’t being dismissive — more like someone trying to calm things down.

“If only one kid saw something — it might’ve just been a prank. Maybe one of the older campers thought it’d be funny to scare the little ones.”

But after a pause, he added:
“Still, don’t let the kids wander off on their own. Not even inside camp. Especially the younger ones. And make sure the cabins are locked from the inside at night.”

Then he looked at me more seriously.
“Stay calm. But don’t ignore safety protocols.”

And then he left.

That evening, we talked it over with the other counselors over coffee. Someone said it was probably just a prank. Some older kid trying to spook the little ones. Someone else said maybe the boy just made it up.

But later, when I stepped outside and looked toward the woods…

I thought I saw something.

Just for a second.

Maybe I was tired.

But I swear — it looked like someone was standing there.

Watching me.

I woke up to screaming.

Not the kind you hear in games or movies — real, panicked, human screaming.

There were footsteps pounding in the hallway. Someone was banging on doors. I jumped out of bed just as one of the younger counselors burst into the building. She was barefoot, in pajamas, eyes full of tears.

“She’s gone!” she cried. “The back door’s broken!”

We ran to the cabin where the youngest girls slept. The back door — the one that led straight into the woods — was cracked open and hanging off one hinge. Splinters on the floor. And an empty bed by the window.

“She was sleeping right there,” the counselor whispered. “She’s five…”

I sprinted to the main office. Didn’t even have to knock — the director was already up, already dressed, flashlight in hand.

“Get the others,” he said. Calm. Direct.

Five minutes later, we were gathered outside the mess hall. A handful of us. Flashlights. Backpacks.

The girls stayed behind with the kids. One of them was already on the phone with the sheriff. But the director didn’t wait.

“We’re not sitting around,” he said. “We’re going now.”

He took the lead. We moved fast, fanning out through the woods in a staggered line. Ten feet apart. Careful, quiet.

Three minutes in, the director stopped.

“Here.”

Hanging from a branch was a torn piece of red fabric.

It was hers.

Further down — a faint trail, like something had been dragged.

And then — a single pink slipper.

No one spoke. No one made jokes.

We kept going. The trail curved through the trees, across a dip in the ground. And then —

The director raised his hand.

“There.”

Between the trees, half-covered in branches, stood an old white trailer.

The kind that looks like it’s been abandoned for years.

Except the light inside…

…was on.

The door creaked when we pushed it open.

It wasn’t locked.
Inside, it smelled like plastic, dust, and something else — something faint and rotten.

There were dolls.
Everywhere.
On the shelves, on the floor, on the tiny couch against the wall.
Their eyes were glassy, unfocused. Some were missing limbs. One sat in the sink, staring up at the ceiling like it had been waiting.

And then we saw her.
The little girl.
Curled up on a thin mattress in the back corner.

Her wrists and ankles were tied with what looked like shoelaces and cable ties.
A strip of duct tape covered her mouth.

She didn’t move when we came in.
Just stared at us — wide-eyed, frozen.

The director dropped to his knees and gently ripped the tape from her face.

“You’re safe,” he whispered. “You’re okay now.”

But she didn’t say a word.

The trailer was empty.
No sign of anyone else.

Two of the counselors carried the girl back to camp.
The director gave them a whistle and strict instructions not to stop for anything until they reached the others.

The rest of us stayed.

He led us to a small rise just off the side of the trailer. Between two pines, we had a clear line of sight to the door. But we stayed hidden in the dark.

“He’ll come back,” the director whispered. “Trust me. People like that… they don’t just walk away from their nest.”

We waited in silence. The grass was damp. One of us kept tapping a flashlight with his fingers. Another was trembling — not from the cold.

Maybe twenty minutes passed.

Then we saw him.

Just a shadow at first — tall, hunched, moving carefully.
Over his shoulder, he carried two life-sized dolls.
One had white hair. The other was missing an eye.

He was whispering to them.

We couldn’t hear the words, but his head kept tilting — first to one, then the other. Like a father calming two kids after a fight.

As he got closer, we saw that the dolls were wearing real children’s dresses.

He reached the trailer, opened the door, and gently set the dolls down on the threshold.

He smiled at them.

And that’s when the director whispered:
“Now.”


He didn’t see us until the last second.

The director moved first. Fast. Without a word.

We swarmed him from all sides. Someone knocked him down, someone else struck him from behind with a branch.

He hit the ground face-first and groaned.

“Wait—” he rasped. “You don’t understand.”

The director grabbed a metal pipe that was lying beside the trailer.

“Hold on,” the man gasped again. Blood was running from his mouth.

And then… he smiled.

“She’s mine now,” he whispered.
“You saved her, but she’ll still think about me.”
“She looked into my eyes. She’ll remember.”

One of us kicked him in the face. Hard.

He lay in the dirt, blood pouring from his nose and lips. He was breathing heavily, but still conscious.

The director said,
“Pick him up.”

Two of us grabbed him by the arms and pulled him to his feet. He wobbled but didn’t fall.

And then he started talking.

“You won’t prove anything,” he said. His voice was hoarse, but calm.
“I didn’t do anything. Didn’t even touch her.”

He smiled, teeth red with blood.

“You’ve got the girl. Alive. You’ve got the trailer. So what? No one’s missing. No one’s dead.”
“The police will come, take a look… and let me go.”

None of us said a word.

“You just got scared,” he added. “And now you want to make me into a monster.”

And then he laughed.

Quiet. Tired. But real.

We walked through the forest in silence, dragging him between us.

But the laughter didn’t stop.

Then the director stopped walking.

He was staring at two tall young birch trees.

After a moment, he said:
“Hold him. I’ll be right back.”

He turned and walked back toward the trailer.

When he returned, he was carrying a coil of rope.

“You’re right, freak,” he said.
“But what if… we never find you in this forest?”

We stood in silence.

No one argued.

No one said, “Maybe we should wait for the police,” or “We don’t have the right.”

Everyone was looking at the director.

And he was looking at two young birch trees, swaying quietly beside the trail.

“Someone out there wants people like this to exist,” he said at last.
“Wants them to have lawyers, court dates, sentences.
So we can all pretend this is just another man.”

“I am a man!” the guy shouted. “I have rights!”

He thrashed, yanking at our grip. Screaming.

We just watched him.

One of the counselors pulled out a roll of duct tape.

A few seconds later, his mouth was sealed shut.

He was still shaking with rage — but it didn’t matter.

The director walked over to the birch trees and started bending them down.

We helped — pressing them to the ground, tying them off.

Then came the ropes. Around his ankles.

He didn’t fight anymore. Just stared at us with wide, wet eyes no one wanted to look at.

“This isn’t a sentence,” the director said.
“It’s just an ending.”

He cut the rope holding the trees together.

Both trunks snapped upright — in opposite directions.

Someone turned away.
Someone froze.

The sound was short.
Dull.
Like tearing wet canvas.

Something red flew through the leaves.

And no one said another word.

We set fire to the trailer from the inside.

The director went in first. He poured gasoline over everything — the floor, the mattress, even the dolls.

One of the guys placed a kerosene lantern in the corner, like it had been left behind.

Then we struck a match.

At first, nothing happened.
Then — a rasping whoosh, like something old and greasy exhaling its last breath.

We didn’t watch it burn.
We walked away.

As for the body — the big parts, we buried.
The rest… the forest would take care of. Predators. Raccoons. Owls.
In a few days, even a dog wouldn’t find anything.

The police arrived in the morning.

We told them we’d been watching the trailer.
That it was empty.
That we’d found the girl in the bushes a few yards away.
And then… the fire started.

“Must’ve been an old lantern,” someone said. “Plastic, dust, bad wiring.”

The sheriff looked at us for a long time.

“You didn’t see anyone go inside?” he asked.

“No,” said the director. “We never left it alone.”

The sheriff nodded.

They found nothing.

The girl didn’t remember anything.
She just asked for tea. And a quiet song before bed.

Three days later, the camp was shut down.
Everyone left. Some went back to college. Some just wanted to forget.

Me…
I still wonder — did we do the right thing?

What if he was right?

What if we killed him… just because we could?

Weeks have passed.
I sleep at home now. It’s supposed to be over.

But last night…

I woke up in the dark.

And I swear — someone was standing outside my window.

Not moving.
Just watching.

Like before.
