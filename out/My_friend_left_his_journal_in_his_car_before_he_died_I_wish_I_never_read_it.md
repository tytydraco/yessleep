I wasn’t sure if I should post this.

Part of me still thinks it’s wrong—like I’m exposing something that was never meant to be read.

However, the cops gave me the journal, stating that I was listed as David’s emergency contact. It was found in the passenger seat of his car the night he was discovered. Pages half-burned, some soaked in whiskey, others covered in what looked like ash and blood.

I almost threw it away. God knows I wanted to.

But curiosity… or guilt, maybe… made me read it.

The first few entries were just ramblings—David blaming himself for the fire, talking about his wife, Hailey, and their kids. But then things got dark.

He wrote about hearing voices, seeing them in mirrors, and smelling smoke that wasn’t there. The further I read, the more his writing changed—becoming sloppier, more fragmented, and paranoid.

The last couple of entries however were written like he got his sanity back compared to the entires before.

And that’s what you’re about to read,

I don’t know if what he described was real or if it was all in his head.

However, after what I saw when I returned to the house…

I’m not so sure anymore.

“I can remember it like it was yesterday—every vivid moment, every smell, every sound—all of it permanently fixed in my head.” I groaned, taking another shot of whiskey.

“Dude, it’s been five years since the accident. When will you let the past be the past and move on?” Mason replied, tone flat, eyes dull from hearing this speech too many times.

I took two more shots before answering. “If you’re trying to cheer me up, you’re doing a fucken shit job at it.” I slammed the glass down. “I lost everything in that damn fire, Mason. Everything I cared about. My wife, Hailey… my kids, Thomas and Emily.”

Mason sighed and turned toward me, pity softening his expression. “Come on, David. Is this how they would’ve wanted you to live? A jobless drunk, sleeping in your car?”

I stared down at the sticky countertop, the reflection of the neon beer sign rippling in spilled liquor. “You think I don’t ask myself that every night?”

The bar hummed with low chatter and distant laughter, but for me it was all white noise—just ghosts pretending to be people.

“I’m just trying to help David. We’ve been friends since kindergarten; there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you.”

Mason stood up and pulled out his wallet, placing cash under his glass, and handed me two hundred-dollar bills.

“Use this money wisely, man, please, don’t just spend it on more alcohol or drugs.”

He gives me one last look and pats my shoulder before exiting the bar, leaving me sitting at the counter alone.

The rain was cold when I finally left the bar. It hissed on the asphalt, soaking through my jacket. My car sat where I always parked it—alone, under a flickering streetlight that made the wet metal glisten like oil. I climbed in, the seat creaking, the stale smell of whiskey and sweat filling the air.

On the dash, the photo stared back at me: Hailey’s smile, Thomas’s missing front tooth, Emily clutching her stuffed rabbit. I reached out, thumb tracing Hailey’s cheek.

“I miss you,” I whispered.

Something shifted in the back seat—just a faint rustle.

I turned quickly—nothing but shadows and my worn blanket. I exhaled, laughing to myself. “Too much whiskey again.” But the air carried a smell that didn’t belong there.

Burnt wood.

I froze.

That smell… that damn smell.


It started as a whisper in my sleep.

“David…”

I woke up sweating and with a pounding headache. The car windows were fogged from the inside. Outside, fog hugged the lot like a ghost. I wiped the glass with my sleeve—and froze.

Written in the condensation were the words:

WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?

The letters bled down the glass as I blinked, melting like ash in water.

I scrambled out, flashlight in hand, scanning the lot. No one there. The fog moved like breath, curling and folding around me. I could swear I heard children laughing—a sound both sweet and wrong, echoing too close.

When I got back in, the photo was gone.

My hands shook as I searched the seat, the dash, and under the floor mat. Nothing. Then, from behind me, a voice whispered through the dark:

“Dad?”

I spun around. Empty. The air reeked of burnt plastic.

I drove all night, too afraid to stop.

“Man, you look like hell,” Mason said the next morning. We sat in the diner, coffee steaming between us.

“I didn’t sleep,” I muttered.

He leaned back, studying me. “You’ve gotta stop doing this to yourself. The fire wasn’t your fault.”

I looked up sharply. “Wasn’t it? I told Hailey I’d fix that damn outlet. I told her I’d be home early. I wasn’t.”

“David, stop,” Masons expression changed looking more serious. “There was nothing you could’ve done David, it wasn’t your fault. This could have happened to anyone.”

I looked up at Mason holding back tears “I was at work when it started. The wiring caught. The whole damn house went up in minutes. The fire chief said they didn’t even make it out of the fucken hallway.”

Silence stretched between us. Mason rubbed his temple, searching for words that didn’t exist.

“If you  keep chasing their ghosts, and you aren’t careful, you’ll end up joining them,” he said finally.

Maybe that’s what I wanted.

Nights bled together. I stopped seeing people, stopped calling Mason. The bottle became my companion. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw them—the house, the flames licking the windows, Hailey’s silhouette at the stairs.

Then, one night, I woke to the sound of humming.

It was her voice. Soft, gentle. The lullaby she used to sing to Emily.

“Go to sleep, my little star…”

My breath hitched. “Hailey?”

The air shimmered in front of me. A faint outline formed—her shape in the driver’s seat beside me, skin pale, eyes empty. She turned, smiling that same perfect smile that once melted my heart.

“Come home, David.”

I blinked—and she was gone.

But in the passenger seat, lying where she’d been, was the photo from before… edges charred, her face blackened by soot.

Today, I drove to what was left of our home. I hadn’t been there since the funeral.

The property was overgrown, and the mailbox rusted and bent. The skeleton of the house still stood, hollow and black. The roof had caved in years ago. I stepped inside, each board groaning beneath my boots.

The air was damp, thick with mildew and something else… something sweet and rotten.

Every step echoed. The wallpaper peeled in strips, revealing smoke-stained studs beneath.

Then I heard it.

A child’s laughter—light, muffled, coming from upstairs.

“Thomas?” I whispered, half believing.

I climbed the charred steps, the wood soft and crumbling under my weight. The hallway stretched longer than I remembered.

At the end, Emily’s room.

Her door was open.

Inside, the walls were scorched black, and the ceiling was half-collapsed. In the corner, her stuffed rabbit sat upright, untouched by time, one glass eye missing.

And behind it, scrawled across the wall in black soot:

“COME HOME, DAD.”

My stomach turned. I backed away—and heard the floor creak behind me.

“David.”

Her voice again. Close this time. Warm.

I turned—and saw Hailey standing at the end of the hall. Her face was blistered, skin cracked and oozing, but her smile… that smile was the same.

“You came back,” she said softly. “We missed you.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. She stepped closer, bare feet leaving wet ash prints on the floor.

“Hailey… what—what are you?”

“We’re waiting, David.” Her voice distorted, breaking apart into static. “You said you’d never leave us.”

Behind her, two small shapes appeared. Thomas and Emily. Their eyes were hollow pits, skin pale and split.

Thomas held out his hand, the skin of his arm peeling like paper. “Dad… come play.”

Emily giggled, her teeth black and cracked. “Stay with us, Dad.”

My heart slammed against my ribs. “No—no, you’re not real—”

The walls groaned. Flames erupted down the hallway, crawling like living things. Smoke filled my lungs.

Hailey’s voice grew deeper, layered with something inhuman. “It’s time to come home.”

I stumbled backward, tripping over debris. The floor split beneath me, heat searing my legs. I screamed as the world became fire.

The house was alive—breathing, burning, consuming. The walls pulsed like veins, the ceiling dripped molten tar.

They closed in around me.

Hailey’s charred hand reached through the smoke, gripping my wrist with impossible strength. Skin sloughed off her fingers, exposing bone, but she held fast.

“Stay, David,” she whispered. “It’s better here. You don’t have to hurt anymore.”

Her eyes were black pits glowing from within, twin furnaces of grief and rage.

Thomas and Emily circled me, laughter warping into shrieks. The air screamed.

I felt something break inside me—something human
.
“Okay,” I whispered. “I’ll come home.”

Her grin widened.

Flames swallowed us whole.


That’s where David’s journal ends. 

They found the car the next morning, parked in front of the house's ruins. Engine still running. Inside, the front seat was empty except for a journal, a bottle of whiskey, and a single photograph on the dashboard.

Three faces smiled back, edges burned away until only one remained clear: David’s.

The police report called it a suicide. I identified the body later—half-burned, found in the basement of the old house.

Locals say if you drive down Sparrow Lane late at night, you’ll see the glow of fire flickering through the trees. Some say they hear laughter.

Others say it’s crying.

And a few claim that if you listen closely enough…

You can still hear a man whispering inside the flames,

“I’m home.”
