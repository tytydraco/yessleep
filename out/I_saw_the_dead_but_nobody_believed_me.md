This story takes place when I was around 5 years old, in Bolton, UK. My mum came into the room with my food and said “Okay, Lacey. It’s time to wash up and eat your food now.” before she walked out. I stood up and walked to the door when I saw a boy around 8 years old standing outside my bathroom door. I screamed as loud as I could but when my mum arrived he was gone. She told me to eat my food and go to sleep. At 5:43AM I was woken up to the soft sound of breathing in my ear. I turned my head and saw the boy from earlier. Frantically, I crawled away as he grabbed me. 

He told me “I need your help.” before disappearing again. A few seconds afterwards my dad burst in and asked me what happened. I told him I had a nightmare and he said to go back to bed. I looked at my wrist where the boy had grabbed me. There was a dark red mark shaped like a hand on my wrist, and it stung. Stung so bad. It felt like my skin was being peeled off of my bone whilst my muscles and veins were being bashed repeatedly with a hammer. After breakfast I went upstairs and found a note on my bed. The handwriting was scruffy but I could sort of read it. The note said “Help Me”. After reading it I took it to my mum who told me to stop joking around. Later on while I was brushing my teeth the boy appeared. This time I didn’t scream, or run away. I stayed there and spoke to him.

“Who are you? What do you want?” I asked cautiously as the boy approached me. His skin was dirty and covered in blood and ash. “My names Charlie my lil pipper. I need your help to ‘scape from this wretched ‘ome” he explained. I told him I would help him. Over time me and Charlie grew closer and would do everything together. One day he didn’t appear and I started to worry. Then my 3 year old brother walked over to me and pointed under my bed. When I looked under there were notes and drawings from Charlie. I looked back at my brother who was now smiling like a maniac before he smashed his toy car into my head. I screamed and began bawling my eyes out while my brother ran off and my parents came dashing in. They asked me what happened but I started hyperventilating. Then I saw Charlie again. 

He was stood outside watching me. Suddenly he was right infront of me. Nobody else could see him and I started panicking. He grabbed me by the neck and before I could do anything he shoved me against the wall and told me to stay there otherwise he would kill my family. He then began throwing my brothers toys at me. My parents saw this and called the only person they could, my grandma. She came over and started getting rid of Charlie. I had to go to the hospital because I had broken my wrist while dodging the toys. After a while I stopped seeing ghosts, but I know Charlie isn’t fully gone. He’s still here just in a different form.
