One night we stayed at the school (before it closed, was abandoned, and left in ruins...). That day we had been working on our final project all day, welding steel angle tables, painting them, finishing the casings of the electromagnets we had been making, and completing the circuits, preparing for the presentation the next day, and there wasn't enough time... so we stayed and didn't sleep at all. It was exhausting.

The bathroom in the industrial area of the school was in a remote corner, next to the soccer field. They used to say it was haunted (I can tell you for sure other things happened there, but haunted? I didnâ€™t believe that). The teacher had left us the keys, so I took them and headed to the bathroom. It was already early morning, but the sun wasn't up yet. Have you heard of places where the distance between this world and the other is very small? That if you're a very receptive person, you can talk to beings from beyond? I had never heard of such places...

I opened the gate, it was blue, though faded, and the steel pipes had rusted. It creaked from the lack of oil, a sound you don't want to hear in a remote corner where no one can hear you scream... the worst part is that looking at the old hinges producing that sound distracted me from the tall figure hiding inside the bathroom; by the time I entered, it was too late...

The creature stepped forward, its face barely illuminated by the dim and distant light coming from the soccer field's reflectors. It looked at me with its empty eyes, so black they were darker than the night itself, like an abyss from which there is no escape; it's skin so pale; and the smile... a grin from ear to ear, with stained... huge teeth. I felt something rise to my right, it was the arm of the creature that passed behind me and then rested on the floor to allow it to lean toward me... I was petrified... its entire neck stretched out and brought its face right in front of mine - "It's been a long time since one has come alone" - it said, with a voice far too high-pitched for a being so large, and then it let out a sigh that dampened my face - "but why does it stay still?" - The creature started to move its head all around me. It's eyes so close to me that I'm sure I could feel them. And its breath spread a hot and wet feeling all over my body. Finally it brought its face back to mine and stayed there. Several minutes passed, and the creature did nothing but breathe in my face, with its enormous smile of yellow and brown hues and its abyss-like eyes. Seeing that nothing was happening, I slowly began to back away... the creature's face didn't move away from mine, it kept the distance perfectly, mirroring my movements. Its smile began to fade as I got closer to the gate... - "did it see me?" - The creature said, and it raised its right arm, which seemed broken, it brought its hand to its head, and scratched; somehow, its eyes grew larger, it seemed confused. I kept stepping back, and finally, I was out of the bathroom, surely I had taken only 5 or 6 steps back, though it felt like a million... I closed the gate and peed behind a tree, thanking God I hadn't peed myself...

I had heard before that in the industrial bathroom, the farthest and most isolated one, students would go to experiment... but I had never heard anything about any creature... a creature that does nothing but spy closely, examining everything, letting nothing escape its gaze, not even the light... I think I entered that bathroom at the wrong time, on the wrong day, when the line between our world and the world of spirits starts to blur.
