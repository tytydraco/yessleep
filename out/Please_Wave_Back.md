I'm not a writer. This isn't for a book or a blog. This is a warning, and if you’re reading this, it means you might need it. And it starts on a stretch of road you don't take at night, the one that snakes through the old forest. Outsiders have been going missing on that stretch of road, and worse, I'm convinced the locals have something to do with it. But I know now. I know what happens to anyone that does not wave.

I moved into this cosy little apartment a short while ago. I never planned on staying long. My Professor asked me to study the area for “scientifically interesting flora”, Botany PhD stuff. I’d done a few rounds in the area, but nothing struck me as interesting. The only place I hadn’t been to yet was the forested road to the north.

The locals seemed oddly eager for me to go there. “A nice place to get lost in nature”, they told me. Promised me I’d find all kinds of things worth studying. But their smiles felt too wide, their insistence too strong, but I tricked myself into thinking it was just a small town thing. And I very well couldn’t go back with half a report.

So, at first light I packed the car and drove up. I can’t say I noticed anything unusual. The wind in the trees, birds were singing, a squirrel hopped from branch to branch. I didn’t really know what I was expecting. I gathered my equipment, and began a survey of the area, collecting specimens, taking photos, scribbling notes etc. I had just finished my last collection when I noticed that the daylight was quickly vanishing. Had I really been out here that long? I glanced at my wrist, but my watch had clearly stopped. I took out my phone, but it was dead. I lied to myself. "Oh my watch has been on its way out for weeks, and my phone always drains quickly when I take pictures". Nothing felt right. I started walking back to my car.

That’s when I saw it.

A sign. It was a weather-beaten, wooden diamond. The paint, a faded, sickly yellow that was peeling at the corners. It didn't stand out; if anything, it seemed to sink into the gloom, almost like it wasn’t meant to be noticed. On it was a black silhouette with, what appeared to be, two small children, holding hands and waving. Beneath it, half hidden by grime, was a simple yet strange message: "Waving children. Please wave back.".

I began to smile at the absurdity of it, “Who puts up a sign like that?”, but my amusement quickly faded.

Not far behind this strange, little sign, were two small figures, standing at the edge of the treeline. Children. They looked like children, though dressed decades out of time. The forest had fallen eerily silent. 

“Hello?” I called out. 

There was no response. The children reached out and held each other’s hands. With their free arms, they began to wave. 

The shadows were long and dark now, and I couldn’t make out any real details. But their faces… I swear they weren’t normal faces. Where their should be eyes were instead these deep, empty voids.

I stepped forward “Are you both OK? Are you hurt, or lost?”. My throat was dry and the words cracked as they came out.

Their calm waves became more frantic. Jerky. Wrong, even. Their heads snapped side to side, their movement a blur.

I tried to run but my body refused. My legs were slabs of stone, my chest crushing inwards. My mind screamed RUN! My heart pounded in my chest like a bird thrashing in its cage.

Then they started forward.

Each step rattled the air with this sickening hum, like a swarm of angry bees. Tree by agonising tree, they got closer. Louder, and louder. My skin prickled with icy cold sweat.

The sign flashed in my mind. I had to wave. They were almost upon me. The humming had become a terrible roar. I forced my arm upwards, my joints stiff as if rusted shut. It felt too slow, too weak. I shut my eyes tight and waited for the end. 

But it didn’t come. 

I dared a sliver of vision to see one of them, mid lunge, mere feet away. Its face was a blur.

My arm was raised! Offering the meekest, most pathetic wave I have ever given. But it was enough.

I felt the tension in the air snap. Both figures stilled, then softened.

Using this opportunity, I stumble back to the road, never taking my eyes off them, always waving.

I got to my car and I fumbled for my keys and dropped them. Cursing, I blindly scrambled for them across the floor, all whilst forcing my hand to keep up that pitiful wave. The sun was almost gone.

Finally I unlocked the door, bolted inside, slammed the door shut, and locked it, as though the thin metal shell would protect me. My hand was relentless.

I jabbed the keys in the ignition, and turned. Glancing back, both creatures had moved to face me. Watching. Not waving. The sun dipped below the horizon with a flash of brilliant green, just as the engine roared to life. My headlights beamed, contending the darkness. But they were there.

Their heads snapped towards me, the voids where their eyes should be drank the light from my car. I hit the accelerator and the car lurched forward.

In the rear view mirror, I saw them. More figures slipping from the tree line. Two, then four. Then dozens. The road ahead was the same. A procession of these child like figures emerging from the woods.

I slammed on the horn, but the sound seemed to die in the oppressive quiet of the woods. My hand was still waving. Speeding, I drove 40mph, then 50, then 60, but everywhere I looked there they were. Standing, watching, a never ending line getting closer with every bend in the road.

I hit the town line and braked hard. The car screeched to a halt.

The children hadn’t followed, or perhaps, they couldn’t.

My hand finally fell to my lap, limp and numb. I sobbed at the sight of the town lights. Relief that was short lived. I drove past the diner. A waitress was frozen, mid pour, coffee spilling over the rim of a cup. The old man she was serving pressed his face against the glass. People on the street stopped as I passed, their eyes tracking me with something. Anger? No... disappointment.

I wasn’t supposed to come back.

And I understood. My suspicions were right from the start. I was chosen for something, and I denied it.

So I drove straight through the night, stopping only when exhaustion forced me off the road.

There was a brief time where I thought that I’d actually got away.

But then the humming returned.

It was faint at first. Easy to mistake for the sounds of modern life. A car engine idling, a plane passing overhead, a dishwasher in the kitchen. But the humming grew. It became a buzz. And then the buzzing turned into a swarm inside my own skull. Louder. And louder!

So I waved.

And it stopped.

So now I can’t stop waving. My arms ache and my joints throb. I’m terrified of what will happen if I stop. I don't know how long I've gone without sleep. I doubt I'll last much longer. 

So, if you see a sign asking you to wave at children, don’t think about it. Don’t hesitate. For your sake, just wave. 

Please. Wave back.
