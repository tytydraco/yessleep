The first few days at the funeral home were much quieter and slower than any other job I'd had.

"That's because most of our clients don't talk back," Jared quipped with a grin as we broke for lunch on the third day of training.

I rolled my eyes and smiled, surprised to find myself hungry even though I knew that just a few doors down, there were dead bodies.Â *Is it even sanitary to eat here?*Â I thought, spearing a piece of lettuce with my fork and staring at it.Â *I mean, body fluids are airborne, right?*

Jared saw the look on my face and chuckled. "I know what you're thinking, Nina," he said, leaning back in his chair. "But don't worry, the break room's a safe zone. Completely separate from the prep area."

He grinned, leaning in conspiratorially. "Hell, you could even eat at the embalming table if you wanted! That's how strong our disinfectants are. Dadâ€”Silasâ€”has been known to do that."

I dropped my fork into my salad. "Seriously?" I squeaked, my stomach churning. "That's disgusting!" I said, feeling queasy. I didn't think I'd be finishing my lunch today.

Jared laughed again, holding up his hands in mock surrender. "Of course not, sorry! Please keep eating. I really need to learn when to shut up."

He rubbed the back of his neck with a sheepish grin. "Elise is always kicking me under the table when dinner guests are over. My shin should be broken by now. I can't help it." He shrugged. "It comes with the environment, I guess. When you've grown up surrounded by the dead, you forget what's normal for other people."

I forced a faint smile and pushed away my lunch. My appetite had vanished completely.

Jared noticed his face falling. "Oh, no! I'm so sorry; it was just a joke. Even Silas isn't that bad."

But his eyes betrayed him, hinting that Silas was exactly that bad. I wondered, not for the first time, how odd and strained their relationship seemed. Whenever Jared mentioned his dad, a storm cloud overtook the room, thickening the air with an unsettling heaviness.

"It's okay! Seriously!" I said hurriedly. "I'm full," I lied, "and it's not very good."

Of course, my stomach betrayed me with a loud grumble at that very moment. Awkward.

Mercifully, Jared pretended not to notice and instead changed the topic, telling me more about his kids. I found myself relaxing as he spoke. He was easy to talk to.

"Ethan's five and full of energy," Jared said.  
"Always running around, always curious, always doing what he shouldn't be doing. And Iris, she's three. She's at that age where she's trying to do everything Ethan does. It'sâ€¦ exhausting but fun. She's a little weirdo like meâ€”she loves bugs. Any bug. Her brother despises them, so we have to stop her from shoving them in his face. She'll yell, 'Bug!' and Ethan will run away screaming. And then I get in trouble with Elise for laughing, but I can't help it! It's so funny and cute."

I laughed, picturing the chaos. "They sound sweet." Then I smiled bitterly, my fingers tightening slightly around the table's edge as I thought of my brother and how we used to terrorize one another.

"They are. And loud," Jared laughed, running a hand through his hair. "But I wouldn't trade it for the world. Elise is a saint for keeping up with them." He paused. "And me."

I leaned forward, pushing the memories away. "How do you do it all?" I asked. "This job, your familyâ€¦ The transition fromâ€”" I gestured around â€” "this, to the liveliness at home. It must be difficult."

Jared's smile faltered just slightly, and I saw the weight of responsibility in his eyes for a moment. "It's difficult," he admitted. "But we make it work. Family comes first, though. Always."

I nodded, understanding the sentiment. "I can tell you love them a lot."

"I do," he said, brightening. "They drive me insane, but I do." He gave me a warm smile. "What about you? What about your family? Any weirdos?" His eyes narrowed conspiratorially. "Are you the weirdo?"

That made me laugh. "I mean, maybe. I collect buttons. You know, as a hobby."

Jared smiled and shook his head. "That's not weird! It's a unique hobby. How many do you have?"

I shrugged. "A few thousand, maybe."

"Wow! That's quite the collection! And your family?"

"Well, I have my mom and dad, but they live at least two hours away. I try to visit as often as possible, but you knowâ€¦ life," I said quietly. "But it's just the two of them now. I-I had a brother, but he died a few years ago. Overdose." I spat the word out; it tasted like a bitter pill on my tongue.

"Gideon, right?" Jared said, his tone sympathetic.

I nodded.

"I'm so sorry, Nina. That must've been incredibly hard."

"Thank you," I said, unable to stop the tears that came whenever I talked about Gideon.

Without a word, Jared reached into his pocket and handed me a small pack of tissues.

"Always gotta have some of these on hand," he said with a faint, comforting smile.

I took the tissues, blinking quickly as I tried to steady myself, my throat tightening.

Jared leaned back in his chair, staring at the table. "When I was a kidâ€¦ my mom died. Vivian. Her name was Vivian. Beautiful, right? She was beautiful." His voice was quieter now. "Silasâ€”Dadâ€”handled everything himself. The prep, the funeralâ€¦ all of it." Jared's eyes flickered with something I couldn't quite placeâ€”anger, sadnessâ€”a mixture of both?

I didn't know what to say to that. It all began making senseâ€”no wonder Jared's relationship with his dad was tense. The thought of Silas handling his own wife's funeralâ€”like just another task on a to-do listâ€”wasâ€¦ wrong. It felt cold and mechanical. A small part of me wondered if that's what this job did to people if it hollowed them out over time until death became just another part of the routine. And how poor Jared must have felt. How could he stand working here still? If something like that happened to me, I would do anything but work around the dead.

"I'm so sorry," I finally managed to say.

Jared nodded briskly, now staring into the distance, lost in memory.

"So, what's the weirdest thing that's happened to you here?" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation somewhere lighter.

Jared's face immediately brightened as he thought for a moment. "Hmmm. The weirdest thing? Hmm, it's hard to say. But there was that one time we found a stray cat hiding in one of the caskets."

I blinked, laughing in disbelief. "A cat?"

"Yup, scared the hell out of me," Jared grinned, shaking his head. "I popped open the casket to do a final check, and there it was, just lounging around like it had booked the place for the night. I mean, paws crossed, total attitude."

I continued to laugh. "So, what happened?"

"I brought him home after I took him to the vet, of course. My kids had been asking for a petâ€”but Elise? Boy, I didn't hear the end of it when I got home."

"What the hell is wrong with you? Why didn't you tell me? Where did it even come from?" He shook his head, grinning. "Of course, I didn't tell her where I found him. Elise is very superstitious. But the kids were ecstatic, and now Elise loves him! She treats him like one of the kids. Cats! There's something about them. His name is Morty. Morty the Fat Cat!" Jared laughed. "Elise always tells me to stop fat-shaming him, butâ€¦ well, heÂ *is*Â fat."

I shook my head, still giggling. Jared was something elseâ€”I'd never had a boss like him. For the first time since starting the job, I felt at ease.

Maybe this could work out. And it could help me with the loss of Giddy.

Also, the pay was too good to pass up.

After lunch, we went to the supply closet to unpack and organize a huge delivery. And since it was so slow today, Jared thought it'd be best to restock, organize, and break down boxes. Jared handed me a box cutter, and we worked in comfortable silence for a while.

"You know," he said, breaking the silence, "I love animals, especially straysâ€”cats, dogsâ€¦ anything that needed a home. Even as a kid, I'd sneak food out for them whenever I could. My mom used to say I'd bring home anything with fur if I had the chance." He chuckled. "Guess that's still true today."

He paused momentarily, then added, "When you grow up around death, sometimes it feels good to take care of something still living."

As he talked about taking care of stray animals, I couldn't help but wonderâ€”did he think of me like that? Just another stray he'd taken in, trying to make sense of things and survive?

Something had been bothering me for a while, but I couldn't quite put my thumb on it. It was the conversation during lunch when he had asked about my family and -

"How did you know?" I asked, my mouth was dry. "How did you know my brother's name?"

Jared paused, glancing up from the box he was opening. "Huh?" he said, his mouth hanging open.

"My brother. Gideon." My heart was pounding. "I never told you his name."

"How did you know?" I asked, my throat tightening. "How did you know my brother's name?"

Jared's face darkened for a second before he forced a smile. "Ohâ€¦ must've come up in the background check," he said, his tone a little too casual and quick. "I didn't mean to upset you. I shouldn't have brought it up."

I nodded slowly, not sure what to believe. On one hand, that did make sense, but I felt uneasy and strangely violated.Â *He's your boss*, I thought,Â *at your place of employment. Of course, he did a background check; it's what jobs do. It makes sense. Chill out!*

But I couldn't shake the unease that overtook me.Â *Just keep working,*Â I thought; the day was nearly over. I grabbed another box, readied the box cutter, and began slicing it open when a sudden chill gripped me.

"Run," a soft, urgent voice whispered into my ear. "Run, Nina! Go!"

Startled, I jumped and looked around. My hand, gripping the box cutter, slipped.

"Ow!" I hissed, feeling a sharp, sudden pain in my hand. I looked down and saw blood pouring from my thumb, seeping into the partially cut box.

Jared glanced up, startled, his eyes widening at the sight of the blood. He drew back for a moment; then concern settled over his face. Quickly, he ripped open a box of tissues and rushed to my side, firmly wrapping them around my bloody thumb.

"Hold it tight," he said. "I'll get the Band-Aids and antiseptic."

Before leaving, he joked, "Be careful not to let it drip on the floor. Otherwise, this place will never let you go." His chuckle was hollow as he closed the door, leaving me staring after him, bewildered.

I pressed the tissues against my thumb. The tissue had already soaked through. I grabbed some more, carefully unwrapping the first one. But as I peeled it away, the wound pulsed, and blood dripped onto the carpet.

"Shit," I muttered. I finished wrapping the tissue around my thumb before bending to blot at the crimson stain.

The lightbulb above me flickered, casting dancing shadows on the walls. I froze, glancing up as it flickered again. Then, with a faint pop, it went out...

*Creaaaak*

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. Slowly, I turned around, my chest pounding, my ears pulsing with each thudding heartbeat.

Numb, I watched as the door creaked open, a sharp gust of cold air sweeping into the room, carrying with it a faint, musty odorâ€”like something long forgotten.

A figure stood in the doorway, staring at me. I stared back, the hair on my neck rising, and my skin broke out in goosebumps.

There was something not right about it. It looked wrong. It leaned at a sharp angle with crooked, bent limbs, and her head lolled on its neck as though unable to support itself.

The air thickened around her, charged with something dark and wrong as though the room was warning me. A strong antiseptic smell mixed with rot filled the room, making my eyes water and my nostrils burn.

The figure stepped forward, and my hands scrabbled at the ground, desperate to find the box cutter. I had a feeling it wouldn't help, but what else did I have?

I scooted back on my butt as far as I could until my back pressed against the wall.

It stumbled as she walked, buckling with every step.Â *They're broken*, I realized.Â *Its legs are broken.*Â The sound of bone grinding against bone echoed in the silence. This was all so unbelievable that I had to laugh.

*Buzzzzzzz*

The light overhead flickered back on with a low humâ€”harsh and glaring, illuminating the room in all its horrific detail.

A woman. It was a woman. Her face appeared blurry as if a paintbrush had swiped over her features, erasing and distorting them. The paint dripped down like melting wax, exposing tendons and the gray bone of her skull.

Her fingers stretched toward me, twitching and spasming.

I was trapped; there was nowhere to go. The stench of her was nauseating. I gagged, then vomited down the front of my shirt.

Her hand shot forward and closed around my throat. Her black fingernails dug into the soft flesh like a clamp. My body thrashed in desperate panic, but her grip was strong and slowly tightened, unrelenting.

Black spots swam in my vision, and my lungs burnedâ€”I couldn't breathe. I was going to die. I clawed at her hand, my nails digging and sinking into her decaying flesh.

She gently stroked the underside of my chin with her free hand.

"Jared," she whispered. "Jared, I missed you so much."

If I could gasp, I would have, but I could only stare at her. I knew who this was nowâ€”this thing that was killing me as her face melted off in rivulets.

My strength was fading, the world was spinning, and the edges of my vision blurred. Darkness was overtaking me. I stopped trying to fight it. My arms went limp at my sides. It was over. I was dead.

"Jared, my baby," Vivian Hollowayâ€”Silas's wife and Jared's momâ€”whispered, her voice full of love. "I love you so much, but sometimes," her grip tightened around my throat, "I just want to crush you into dust."
