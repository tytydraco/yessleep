It was a normal day at the office. We all had clocked in a couple hours ago, on our 3rd cup of lukewarm coffee watching plasma. It was bad enough the sterile white lights of this dreary liminal office felt as though they were burning my retinas every time I dared to look up. The higher ups had become obsessed with observing the plasma around this one planet in a solar system all by itself 10 million light years away. We of course had an image to watch the planet but since plasma is the only way to “hear” anything in space, it was mainly that we were obliged to stare at it. To their credit, the planet did look interesting. We had a pretty clear picture of the planet and it looked like a fungi octopus thing. The planet had these bio luminescent plates that emitted lights all the way to the Andromeda galaxy.  It had these tentacles that appeared to crack through some of the plates and wave around. 

“Do you think it's alive?” 

My eyes darted over to meet Ursas. Her eyes were a deep green and she seemed oddly worried. Her face was quivering, her small nose twitching, her freckles shifting with every micro movement of her face.



“I mean I don’t think planets can be alive, they're made of minerals or gas and to my knowledge those don’t come alive.”



Ursas eyes darted down to her lap, and back up to me. 



“Stella, come over here for a second. I have to show you what I found.” 



I had never heard her so scared. I was shocked. She, like all of us, loves space and the unknowns of our universe. We worked through all of those years of school after all. We've come across some weird cosmic stuff before, calls for help from light years ago, abandoned outposts on distant planets, you get the idea. So her being scared of something cosmic was a shock.  She quickly pulled up some files from a folder she had hidden. 



“You know how a couple days ago after holiday we all got put on plasma watch?” 



“Yeah.” 



“Well I decided to come in because I had nothing better to do and I wanted to check on the rover that was tasked with investigating the outpost from millions of years ago.”



She took a deep breath and pulled up these near faded pages that the rover captured that contained alien text. She started to pull up transcriptions almost frantically and I had to say something. 



“You do know that these won't help us right? They didn't leave behind anything we don't already have and they aren't even here anymore. We would have received something from them by now.”



“Just read”



She spoke softly and with a worried tone, almost as if people were watching. 



The translation was a set of instructions on how to make a planet come to life. How it was the next step in evolution. Collective godhood. I planted my hand on Ursas shoulder feeling her shuddering. 



“Ursa, please don't tell me that you think this planet is magically going to come to life.”



“Stella it already is. The moon orbiting it has to be its child. Why do you think after the holidays we were tasked with focusing on the plasma around the moon and planet? It's to see if we can pick up any semblance of sound around it.” 



“Ursa-” 



“Please believe me, we have to tell the others, what if it can come to us and destroy us? We have to prepare. What if… What if they succeeded and these world leaders want to try and replicate this? We all would be beholden to something not right with nature and the order of things.” 



Tears started swelling in her eyes. 



“Look, what we are watching happened in the past, if they wanted to destroy us they already would have. And there's no way world leaders would take a gamble on evolution.” 



“The texts say that after bringing life to the planet it is to swallow all surrounding planets and lay an egg for a new one. What if that moon is the egg? What if it really is the next stage of evolution? What if that's why the universe is so old but we are so new? What if-”



“You sound nuts! There's no way that these aliens from years and years ago tried to bring their planet to life to evolve. Please, let this go.”



Her eyes were like daggers, and each tear hurt my very soul. 



“Im sorry, I didn't mean-” 



“It's okay.”



She slinked into her chair and closed the files. She started watching the plasma again. As did I.



The next day was the same. Lukewarm coffee, the liminal office sucking the soul out of me, and Ursa looking up at the higher ups office with a sense of fear. 



“Hey Stella, do you wanna come over to my place after work? I need to show you something I found.”



“Why not here?”



“They’re watching.”



I didn't want to put up a fight. I felt bad for Ursa. We had started this job at the same time and quickly became friends. Best friends. We were a fun contrast, she always was a little chipper, her ginger hair and green eyes and my jet black hair and deep blue eyes. 



After work, we got into our respective vehicles and I followed Ursa to her house. She unlocked the door and motioned me to come inside and locked the door behind me. Her house was cozy, with dark green walls and subtle warm lighting illuminating earthly accessories but also space nerd decorations. For someone I've had such deep conversations about the cosmos with I didn't expect her to be so earthy, so to break the soul draining silence that had been between us all day:



“Wow, I didn't expect you to have so much earthly stuff. It's so green and warm. My house is all cold and blue.”



“Well as much as I love space, Earth is my home after all. I fell in love with this planet before space.”



She looked solemn. Her eyes were glossy and her hair was loosening from her clip and obscuring her face. 



“Follow me, my office is right over here.” 



I followed her and as we neared the office I felt scared. Each step felt like I was walking towards doom. As if as soon as I entered the room there would be two of me. One who would look out at the cosmos with horror, and one with the same naive love for space. 



We entered the office and it was a complete shift from the rest of the house. It was all dark with deep blue accents. The lights were dim and the whole office felt just plain eerie. Like I stepped into a whole separate realm. Ursa immediately went to her computer and pulled up the plasma from work. I remained silent as I felt my breath becoming harder to gather. It felt like I was breathing through a cloth stretched over my face. 



“Alright put these headphones on.” 



I knelt down beside her and took the headphones. I pushed my hair behind my ears and put the headphones on. 



It was breathing.



The planet was breathing. It sounded like a low drawn out Gjallarhorn. It reverberated around my brain and it moved me to tears. Each exhale lasted 20 seconds and each 20 seconds rattled my bones. 



“Stella, it's breathing. It's actually alive.”



She grabbed me by the shoulders holding back tears. 



“And that's not all. The moon is growing its own tentacles. Its suckers are sticking to the crest and unsticking. It's going to hatch soon.” 



She got up and started pacing. 



“We have to tell people, we have to bring awareness so if anyone tries to make us into that thing we can stop it. We can’t become that. That's… unholy.”  



I immediately agreed. I didn't want to become that. Where do we as individuals go? All our culture, architecture, millions of years of our evolution gone with us pouring into some cosmic experiment to become a man made God.  



We spent hours putting the recordings onto forums, even some images we could get of the planet and its moon to  try and hopefully get this exposed and known. Sending things to news stations and newspapers but no one would take the story. We did this for at least 3 months. Eventually me and Ursa got called into the office and sat down and shown all the stuff we were posting. They said if we post anything else we would never be seen again. To not interfere with humanity's future. That this will push us past our last filter. 



We were defeated. Even our own colleagues wouldn't listen to us because they stopped actually watching the plasma after 3 days. They went to watching other planets and trying to reach back further and further in time. Me and Ursa had to live with this cursed knowledge for months. 

Two days ago, the moon finally hatched. It started cracking. Tentacles started sprawling out. The moon cried out . Mutters engulfed the office and Ursa started bawling. 



The newborn planet shed its shell and was bio-luminescent like its parent. The other planet benign to unfurl and reveal its true form. It roared, outstretching to the bounds of the solar system it resided in. It had a body that seemed much like our own, but every appendage was tentacles and what should have been eyes,mouth, nose, and ears were all suckers. Its plates were now dissolving into a liquid that would rise up and immediately freeze, revealing more tentacles sprawling everywhere. The two let out a screech and the end of the parents tentacle formed into a hand and miraculously spawned a black hole and the two entered and the black hole immediately disappeared.  We were all dumbfounded by what we saw. 



“Attention!”



We all turned our heads to the higher ups who had finally come down from their office. The big boss stomped forward to the railing and bellowed out:



“What we just witnessed was the birth of a new stage of evolution.”



He immediately looked over to me and Ursa and said: 



“You are to tell no one. If you tell anyone outside of this room, you will be executed.” 



Me and her froze up and stopped breathing. 



“We, for now, are safe as what just occurred was 10 million years ago. There's been no activity in our proximity but we will continue monitoring further reaches of our known universe. Don't be afraid. We are going to break past our last filter.”



Me and Ursa finally started breathing again and our coworkers all stared at us muttering to each other. I wasn't going to sit around for the rest of my shift in this liminal hell. I got up, took Ursas hand, got our bags and drove home. Ursa now was completely drained of all tears. She looked as though she had looked death in the eyes and shook its hand. 



We sat down on my couch and sunk. The house was cold but I didn't feel like getting up and turning on the heat so me and Ursa warmed each other up. She wrapped around my arm and rested her head on my shoulder and I rested my head on hers. 



“What do we do Stella? They’re gonna make us become that… thing sooner or later.” 



“There’s nothing we can do. We can try and post one more thing and hope that people rebel and we can continue living as we are. Following this ritual to fuse us all into the planet and bring it to life so we can become a collective God. Sacrificing the whole human race for an abomination of a step of evolution.”



We sat and watched movies, read books, watched TV, and listened to music, trying to enjoy life before I made this post and risk our lives. Enjoying all these forms of human expression one last time just incase they really did execute us. 



And now I am writing this post. My last hope. Please, when they start trying to round us up, fight back. Show love to your loved ones and organize defense measures. We can't lose what makes us human to become God.
