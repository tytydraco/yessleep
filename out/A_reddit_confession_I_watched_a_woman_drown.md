A few weeks ago I ended up in the ER for severe dehydration. I nearly died. I didn't run a marathon, wasn't trapped in the desert, I was sitting on my front porch. My neighbor was the one who found me. 

I wish he hadn't.

How did I get here in the first place?  

It all started three months ago...

I'm half Korean on my father's side. He died from lung cancer right before his 60th birthday and shortly after my 30th. After his funereal I decided I would explore my roots. 

So I took a lone trip to Korea. I didn't speak a single word of Korean but I had a translator on my phone. Plus, a lot of people know English. I figured I was all good. Right?

Wrong.

It was a lonely trip, and turns out not knowing the language was a lot harder to navigate than I thought. On my last night, I was eating  bulgogi at a restaurant alone. My eyes were watering, it was way too spicy even though I asked for *no spice*. 

A few girls who looked around my age giggled and watched as I tried to finish my meal. I coughed and downed a glass of soju.

One of the girls came over and teased, "Too spicy?" 

I wiped my mouth with a napkin and smiled, glad to hear that she spoke English. Her name was Hana.

One thing lead to another and I found myself at a house party with Hana and her friends. Over a dozen people squished in a tiny apartment in Seoul. 

They spoke in Korean most of the time. I couldn't keep up with my translator so I just sat and nodded, pretending to understand.

Hana gave me a pill. "Make you happy not lonely and sad." She insisted. *Fuck it*, I swallowed the pill down with my beer.

She was right. That shit made me happy. Suddenly I felt like I could understand every word that was being said. We laughed and drank and partied all night long.

Then at some point ghost stories came up. Some guy warned me about Mul Gwishin - water ghost - and the vibe shifted. This guy seemed serious. Everyone suddenly seemed serious.

In Korean folklore, Mul Gwishin are spirits of people who've drowned and now they're trapped in the water. They cry out for help, acting like they're drowning and when you go in to help them, they pull you under, drowning you, and you take their place.

"Mul Gwishin, you better watch out." His face was stone. 

No one said anything. I thought maybe someone would laugh but no one ever did. The night was over.

Hana said she'd walk me home.

We walked alongside the Han River. There were lights reflected on the water from the Banpo Bridge which is known for having this awesome rainbow fountain. Look it up, it's beautiful.

It was super quiet.

Not a lot of people out which was surprising. Sure it was two in the morning but I guess I just expected more people.

About a block from my hotel, Hana said she had to pee really bad and dipped into a 24/7 mart. I waited outside.

And that's when I heard it - something near the river. It sounded like someone yelling.

I went to look.

I was shocked to see a woman screaming and thrashing in the river. She was drowning.

And all I did was stand there and watch, frozen. It all happened so fast. Too fast for me to do anything - that's what I told myself again and again.

But deep down, I know that's a lie. I could've helped but I was too scared. Too scared of Mul Gwishin.

The woman struggled a while longer then disappeared under the water. Why didn't I yell for help? I ask myself that question all the time. I don't have an answer. 

Her body floated to the surface. And still, I just stood and stared.

Then a voice yelled out - it was Hana.

She ran past me, into the water, and pulled the woman out. She tried to save her but it was too late.

I'll never forget what that woman looked like. Her mouth was hanging open and her eyes were wide...and I dunno, she seemed horrified and disappointed? She was looking right at me.

I left Korea in a panic. Never saw or spoke to Hana again.

I didn't look up any news articles or anything like that about the drowning, I didn't wanna know about the victim, I wanted it all to go away. 

*But it didn't.*

One day I was on my lunch break, sitting in the park, when I heard a sound coming from the fountain.

It sounded like someone crying out for help.

My blood ran cold.

I went to the fountain and no one was there. I figured I must be losing my mind. Nothing some drugs couldn't fix, right?

My doctor put me on 10 mg of Lexapro. She said we'd start with 10 then go to 20 if I needed it. 

Well the 10 didn't help and neither did the 20. And neither did anything else. 

I started to hear that woman's cries every time I took a shower - coming from the drain.

So I stopped taking showers and baths.

I got fired from work when co-workers started complaining about the smell.

Whenever I turned on the faucet I heard her cries again. I couldn't drink a glass of water without hearing her. So I started buying bottled water. But then, when I opened the bottles I could hear her down *INSIDE THE BOTTLE.* 

When it rained it was the worst. During a storm the wind sounded like her howls, the rain beating against the windows sounded like her arms smacking the water.

Wherever there was water, she was there crying out for help. 

Then she was there in **all** liquid - milk, juice, all of it.

When I opened a can of soda it *hissed* and sounded exactly like the air leaving her lungs that night.

I stopped drinking all together. No water, no liquids - nothing, ever.

In the ER they gave me an IV. I could hear her in the bag. I ripped the IV outta my arm and ran.

Now I'm back home. I can't take it anymore, can't go on like this. So this is the last thing I'll ever write - my confession. I wrote it before I grabbed the knife.

I'm sitting here now, waiting to die. Slit my wrists wide open. And I swear, I can hear her in my blood.

Update: I'm alive. I don't know how or why. I'm back at the hospital, and it's storming outside.
