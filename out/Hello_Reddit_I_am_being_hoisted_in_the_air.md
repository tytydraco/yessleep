As titled help Reddit.

I was on my shift at a derelict gas station in the middle of nowhere. Unbeknownst to me, I started floating while I was on my shift. I was working the cash register, and when I rung up my co-worker, let's say Sam, for cigarettes, he told me and I quote "Damn."
When I asked him what was up he said. "You." 
I asked him again what he meant and he said I was floating. 
I thought he was bullshitting, I wish he was.

I am currently being pressed against the ceiling and cannot get down, I've tried everything but alas my feet won't reach solid ground. Being posted from my phone using the shitty wifi, I hope help arrives soon. I don't want to eat that fly on the ceiling tile.

Yo he dropped his phone. Not sure what's going on it's not really funny anymore. Dammit he's pissing now. Just called the cops, but he's starting to go through the cheep ceiling tiles. Don't think he'll make it through the roof, but at this rate it might flatten him.

Update: he reached the metal ceiling. It's making some loud ass sound. It's not looking good for him, really hope he doesn't make it through that would suck. Also cops pulled up, might be able to pull him down.

They got a ladder out the back but that metal ceiling is really loud and he's starting to scream really loud.

Update 2: they attacked some rope to him and are trying to drive with the rope attached but he isn't budging. That ceiling probably won't hold much longer. 

Good God it's not holding. It's giving way as we speak. I don't know what to do. 

He's made it through the ceiling, he's got cuts all over his face from the broken metal ceiling. I don't even think he's conscious at this point. He stopped screaming.

Update 3: Dear God, he's like 30 some miles in the air I think. I forgot his password for a minute. It was his fucking birthday how could I forget that. And now I can't do anything to save him. 

I think the police are trying to get air traffic control to avoid this area period. I really hope they work that out.

Update 4: it's been about an hour, there's one plane they can't contact. He's fucked. It's basically on a damn near collision course. 

5 minutes until impact. I'm sorry, Darsh. There's nothing I can do.

5 seconds. Holy shit it fucking exploded shit fuck shit. The plane just flew through him and hit the ground a few miles down the road. It blew up over the horizon. The suns coming up. He's like an angel up there.

Update 5: He's falling now. Police have the area taped off. Feds were supposed to arrive tomorrow. I doubt they'll care now. 
He's splattered on the floor tiles. God what do you even do after this.

Posted this because why not, I miss you, Darsh.
