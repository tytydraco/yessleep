If my[ first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ql3xuw/my_uncle_owns_a_hotel_where_things_go_when_theyre/) somehow failed to convey my soul-deep loathing for my uncle, then *firstly,* I apologize for such a tragic shortcoming on my part. 

Secondly, I reconfirm to you that yes. I do in fact loathe Grant.

Thirdly, I congratulate you (assuming we’re all on the same page now) on your ability to understand a concept my mother has struggled to grasp for years. Due to this learning challenge, she looks positively delighted when she walks into my childhood bedroom, waving our archaic landline phone and wiggling her eyebrows.

“Absolutely not,” I say. “I’d rather stick my head in a meat grinder.”

“You don't even know who it is.”

“It's Grant calling at the start of each semester, like he always does. I won't go work for him again. I refuse.”

“He's family. You can't threaten to hurt yourself just because he phones you.”

“You're right. I'd rather *he* stuck *his* head in a meat grinder. Tell him that, will you?”

“*Terra*.”

I sigh and try to calm down―a thing I've always found particularly difficult and never particularly rewarding. 

I prepare to explain to my dear mother that *I'm a grown adult woman even if, yes, fine, I do happen to currently be living in my childhood room.* And *you have no idea what Grant did. Why can’t you let me forget him?*

Unfortunately, preparing these arguments takes a whole five seconds, which is all the time my mother needs to thrust the phone in my hand, declare, “here she is!” and slam the door behind her. Since it's a corded landline, I don't even have the human right of being able to repeatedly press the hang-up button.

“No,” I tell him. “Absolutely not.”

“Why?” he responds. 

No pleasantries. No greetings. Straight and to the point. I used to like that about my uncle.

“I’m in college―”

“Your mother’s already told me you got kicked out.”

“―and what was the second reason again? Hmm. Oh, right. I hate you, Grant. That was it.”

“*Terra*.” He says it just like my mother.

“No. Don’t even. Just don’t. How do you not understand this by now? I will never come back and work at your hotel, not in a thousand, trillion years. That’s the end of it.” I glare daggers at him through the phone, even as I’m fully aware that isn’t how phones work.

“I know you're angry, but―”

“You killed her.”

It's silent. I wait for him to deny it as he's done in the years since I quit. 

Cynthia. His angelic wife. My favorite aunt. He gave me a home at Hotel Denouement, the first in my life, and then he tore it away by using me to murder her. I will him to say he didn’t.

He doesn't.

“Goodbye Grant.”

“Something’s after my daughter.” 

I’m silent.

“That’s why I’m calling. Regardless of what you think I have or haven't done, something is after the hotel.” Grant lowers his voice. “It’s going for Lucy.”

I slam my fist at the wall.

Two days later, I'm on the first train to the place I swore I'd never go again.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



I spend the train ride up to Hotel Denouement fantasizing about what nasty things to yell at my uncle once I arrive.

If you hadn't noticed by now, my personality errs on the side of *scream now, apologize later* (light on the apologize). Anger is so much more satisfying when there's solid righteous justification behind it, meaning opportunities like these are rare. I take full advantage.

*You made me trust you,* I’ll say. *You used me and discarded me. You couldn’t stomach hurting her yourself so you made me do it, you lying, worthless, evil coward.*

He’ll apologize. Grant has always been good at apologies: poor room service, rats in the walls, cold oatmeal at our complimentary breakfasts. He wasn’t born with natural charm, but he's practiced it to precision. He can turn a one-star review into a five-star. Make a repeat guest out of a furious one.

I won’t let him charm me ever again.

*You say you love your daughter. So why did you leave her without a mother?*

Part of me knows what I’m doing. The more I think about Grant, the less space there is for me to think about everything else I’m heading towards. The community I left. My cousin, Lucy. 

Mateo.

An uncomfortable churning fills my gut when I think about seeing Mateo’s face. Is it fear or excitement? I probably wouldn’t even recognize him now.

My rage probably isn’t healthy, but it is easy. I give in to it. Let it consume me. Some people calm down when given time to think. I pressurize.

When the train finally emerges from an expanse of forest, Hotel Denouement comes into full focus. It teeters on a cliff’s edge. Beyond it: a steep drop into an empty, black void stretching past the last dregs of existence and then some. 

It’s the middle of the day. Sun shines down on houses dotting the cozy, hilly countryside. Even so, past the hotel it’s eerily, unnaturally dark. More than that, it’s still, the stillness of a held breath or beast of prey just before it strikes…

I barely notice.

By the time I’ve disembarked and am storming through the lobby doors of Hotel Denouement, drool is practically flying from my jaws.

*Where is he? Where is Grant?* I may have come to help Lucy, but that doesn’t mean I can’t commit a splash of murder on the side. I storm past both the front desk and a sickly pale couple handing their luggage to a bellhop―my guess is they came here to die. That or they’re here for a hearty meal of fresh corpse, which *yes*, is occasionally provided by room service.

Irrelevant.

His office. That’s where he’ll be. I can already imagine strangling Grant right there, at his desk, with his phone cord. *Here’s me helping Lucy, you psychopath!* I’m fully prepared to do it.

What I’m not prepared for is what happens next. 

I kick the door open. “What is this!” I demand. “You betray me, and now you ask for my…um, where’s Grant?”

The wide-eyed girl that stares up at me from his desk is halfway through slurping a mouthful of noodles. They dangle there, limp.

She spits them out, collects herself, and rises in outrage.

“Who are you?” I demand.

“What are *you*?” she returns.

“If you don't know who I am, then you clearly don't belong in this office,” I say. 

“*You* don’t belong in this office.”

“Where’s Grant?” I say.

“Tell me who you are,” she snaps back.

“You first.”

“No, *you.*”

This continues.

For a while.

We go on like that for, no exaggeration, nearly five minutes―me demanding her to tell me who she is, her demanding the same. Neither of us gives an inch. I’m used to people toppling over when I shove at them, so the entire exchange unbalances me. The only person I’ve met who’s as stubborn as me is….

I interrupt her mid-demand. “Candace?” 

Her mouth falls slack. She stares at me.

It’s been a few years. Her hair is half as short, and she’s gained weight. Not a lot, but enough that the shape of her face is different from what I remember. More than that, the last time I saw her, we were in different stages of life. I was eighteen. She was ten years older than me. Now, though, we’re both just adults.

I let out a breath and slump into the chair across from the desk.

“It’s me,” I say. “Terra. You look different. So do I probably.”

“Terra?” Her expression softens. Recognition spreads through her. “What are you doing…?” She straightens, face re-hardening, still refusing to sit. “You’re not allowed here.”

“Um. Like actually, excuse you?”

“You *left.* I don’t know what you’re doing back, but Grant says we’re not supposed to believe anything you tell us. Get out.”

“Grant’s the reason I’m here.”

“I highly doubt that.”

“Ask him.”

But her face is a slab of granite. “Get out of my office.”

“Your office? What do you mean your office? Candace, what is going on?”

“GET OUT.”

I’d never been sure whether she was just annoying because I’d known her as a teenager―*everybody* was annoying back then―or if Candace genuinely was an aggravating person. 

Mystery solved.

Arguing with her never worked. I remember that. Threatening, fighting, bullying―they’d worked on the other cousins but never her, possibly because she was the oldest of us all, or maybe just because women had to sharpen their teeth in this family to survive.

 Violence has always been my go-to. Never Grant's though. He was the only one who'd ever managed to control her, so I try something desperate. I do something out of his book, a thing I never would have dared, desired, or had the skills to attempt, as a hormonal teenager: I try *being nice.*

My hands raise. I plaster on a sympathetic smile. 

“Okay,” I say. “I’m sorry. I can leave. Really. That wasn’t fair of me to surprise you.” I even get up to go. At the door, I pause. “But please, can you just tell our uncle I did stop by.”

“I can’t.”

“Why?”

She glowers at me for three heartbeats more. Then she collapses into the desk chair and buries her face in her hands. 

“He’s gone,” she sobs. “He disappeared.”



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Please understand that most of this information comes between bouts of blubbering, crying, and sniffing and as such might not be entirely reliable. This is what I gather about what happened though.

Two days ago (the same day Grant called me) a storm started. They’re fairly common around Denouement. They originate deep within the eternal void, then make their way into the living world―black lightning, 50 mph winds, golf-ball-sized hail. The works.

Mostly, these storms blow past us and pitter to a drizzle by the time they reach the next semblance of civilization. Occasionally, though, the only way to kill them is to present a sacrifice.

Not a *live* one mind you. Not usually. Corpses generally work fine, the fresher the better; the things in the void have a taste for them, but there weren’t any two days ago.

I know it sounds like a lot of things die at my family's hotel―to be fair, they do―but it’s still not an everyday occurrence. Plus a lot of times families want the bodies back. *Plus* a fair amount of the more-than-humans don’t even leave bodies when they die. 

Point is, there were no available bodies two days ago, and the storm was getting worse and worse. Town is built to withstand this sort of stuff, but even it has limits. Trees started snapping. Fences started coming down, and windows started bursting.

My uncle decided to take his chances reasoning with the void and seeing what else might interest it. He threw on a coat and made his way all alone into the storm.

He never came back.

“You think the void tore him apart?” I ask Candace.

“He wasn’t slated to die. They only kill things that are about to die anyway.”

“Okay. But I mean it’s only been two days. He could just be, I don’t know, taking a break?”

She glares at me.

I hold up my hands. “That was stupid.”

Of course he isn’t on vacation. It’s been five years since I worked here, but I still know Grant. He doesn’t take vacations. He doesn’t take time off. He doesn’t even get sick (or admit it). Grant wouldn’t leave for almost two full days unless something undeniably terrible had happened to him.

*In which case I can no longer murder him myself. Alas.*

I don’t say it out loud, but the timing is all too convenient. Grant calls me, more terrified than ever before. That same night he’s gone?

Nah. No way. He used to rely on me because of my intuition for these things, and my warning sirens are currently blaring. 

“He told me something was after Lucy before he disappeared," I say. “What was that about?”

“It’s…” Candace hesitates. Color drains from the edges of her face, as if merely *thinking* about the thing makes her queasy. 

“Yeah?”

“It’s nothing. Not your problem. I can’t talk about it with outsiders.”

“I’m not an outsider.”

“I can take care of it!” She glares at me through her mascara streaked face. The box of tissues is no longer in use. All at once, our relationship has swapped back to hostile. My neck practically aches from the whiplash.

That doesn’t mean I’m surprised though.

Candace was always, for lack of a less petty term, *jealous* of me growing up―while *I* was growing up that is. That was the issue. She was the oldest cousin. I was one of the youngest. She was in her twenties, yet it was me, a teenager, that my uncle chose to take care of things in his stead.

When he was at Lucy’s dance recitals, I was the one to escort our important guests to their rooms. When he needed a rat-person removed from the premises, it was me he handed the pepper spray. Back then, Candace tried desperately to play the game to win Grant's conditional love; I just played it better.

In my absence things have shifted. It makes sense. He had to knight somebody as his new brainless minion―thank goodness it wasn’t one of the cousins I actually liked.

 Candace has probably spent the last five years thinking the same ridiculous things that I used to think. That when Grant is ready to retire, things will pass to her. Now that he’s gone, though, it's all sped up.  There's a power vacuum she’s trying to fill herself.

And then I show up.

*Stay nice,* I remind myself. *No violence.*

“Candace, I’m not trying to take over the hotel. I *hate* this place. The only reason I’m here is for Lucy.”

“Lucy’s fine.”

“Where is she?”

“She's with her neighbors. You need to leave.”

“Neighbors? If something more-than-human is after her, not just anybody can keep her safe.”

“She’s safe.”

“How do―”

“She’s with Mateo.”

It takes me off guard. *Him*. Whatever protest I’d planned on making slides back down my throat. If Lucy is with Mateo, then however I might feel about Candace, she did make one good decision. No matter what goes after Lucy, he won’t abandon her. Never.

“Can I at least have a room for the night?” I ask.

Candace considers. She wipes at her tear streaks. “There’s some empty rooms on floor seven.”

It takes every ounce of restraint not to dive for the pair of scissors on the desk and stab them into her neck.

“Give me a *real* room, and I’ll leave in the morning,” I say instead. “I swear on our family honor.”

Floor 7―at the risk of sounding cliche, the *forbidden floor*. Nobody stays there. The elevator doesn’t stop there, and any doors to it are sealed shut. We don’t talk about floor 7. (Don’t ask in the comments. I won’t be answering.)

Finally, Candace nods. “One night. Only because you’re family.”

She retrieves a key from the front desk, then escorts me personally to room 228. I thank her, promise her to stay in my room until the morning, and grab a towel as if to take a shower.

The second her footsteps have faded, I drop the towel on the floor and leave.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Inner family politics. Gotta love them.

I really might consider leaving like I promised if it weren’t for Lucy. She was a sweet kid when I knew her. Even now, she can only be twelve or thirteen, too young to handle all this on her own. More than that, though? I owe her. Even if I trust Mateo, her mother should be the one protecting her.

Candace really doesn't need to fear anything from me. She can have the hotel. Burn it down if she wants. I don't care about her, and I don’t care about Grant. All that really matters is finding out what’s putting Lucy in danger and taking it out the way I used to take *other* things out. 

Grant's office is on the first floor. That's where my oldest cousin will be, so I start my investigation on the top floor.

It's how I remember it. The carpet, light blue speckled with black, is the same. The pinstripe wallpaper, the antique door handles, the faint scent of lilacs and formaldehyde, even the occasional whimper or growl behind a locked door―all of it is entirely how it was. 

There's the occasional rip in the flooring. A dent in a wall or a painting where there used to be flat wall. Overall, though, it's the mirror image of my childhood. Even the decorative wall sconces that Cynthia used to hate still hold lightbulbs. Maybe *that's* why she's dead: decor disagreements.

*Focus.*

I won't be staying. There's no use in regurgitating memories.

I don't waste time checking each individual room. What's the point when I don't know what I'm looking for? Especially when there's a whole group of people that already know the answers I'm searching for. Instead, I seek out my cousins.

It's Lenny I find first. The room door is ajar. Even from the hallway, there's an audible huffing and scrubbing from the contents of the room. When I enter, sure enough, my cousin Lenny is scraping something green and oozing from the bathroom mirror. A janitorial pushcart is next to him.

“Long time,” I say.

He takes one glance at me, then keeps cleaning. He hardly looks surprised. 

“Candace said we can't talk to you.”

“Already? She's efficient, I'll give her that. All I need to know is what's threatening the hotel.”

“Leave, Terra.”

I push.

He growls and keeps scrubbing the mirror.

*Be calm. Be nice.*

But eventually, I get fed up enough to slam my fist against the glass. It breaks. Shards rain down and shatter against the bathroom floor. Behind the spot the mirror sat, a knee-height passageway snakes off into the wall. There's the flash of something multi-eyed, scaled, and vaguely human-looking. It scuttles away.

“You lot haven't even gotten the pest problem fixed?” I scoff.  “Pathetic.”

The next few cousins are no more help, even though I reattempt an attitude of politeness. That’s what worked with Candace. Perhaps my life philosophy of violence needs adjusting―no luck though. Even the non-family employees, people I've never met, seem to recognize me. It's like Candace sent out a massive group text with my picture or something. 

Yes actually. That's *exactly* what she did. A kind but wary-looking maintenance woman confirms as much on the next floor down. I don't even bother pushing her for answers. She's not family. I don't want to risk getting her fired.

By the time I reach the first floor, I'm tired, cranky, and a tad bit offended. It's one thing to know you never want to see a certain group of people again. It's another to know they have equal disinterest in seeing you.

When I finally reach the front desk, smoke is steaming from my ears. I don't recognize the boy checking people in, but with the nose, the red hair, and those eyebrows―he's family for sure. Probably just graduated high school.

“Need me to explain, or do you already know what I'm here to ask?”

“Right with you, ma’am.” He hands a key to a couple signing in, two women with the same buckteeth.

“Hey!” I slam down my hands. The two women startle. “*Shoo*.” They scuttle off.

 “You can't just― just―” The boy takes me in and his eyes go wide. “It's you!” 

“It is. *Now*. Care to tell me what nobody else will?”

“She told us not to speak with you.”

“You like having her in charge then,” I demand. “Miss crabapple?”

“No,” he says weakly. “She’s scary though.”

“Oh yeah?” 

Please understand. I really did try to restrain myself today. Disregarding one tiny, smashed mirror, I've been overall courteous to Denouement employees who didn't want to talk. I even *smiled* at Candace. Maybe if I was kind, maybe if I stayed civil, somebody, eventually, would help me, seeing how I literally came here to help them after Grant *begged* me. 

Turns out that tactic sucks.

I give a cheerful half-wave to the next guest in line―then slam my cousin’s face against the desk. He yelps. I pin him down with my arm and snarl in his ear.

 “Scares you, does she? You can't think of *anything* else that scares you more? Nothing at all?”

“She could fire me. Now that Grant's gone, she could actually do that.”

“Fire you? The tragedy.” I push my elbow deep into his ribs.

He gasps. “Don't make me tell you what it is, please.”

I push harder, not hard enough to *actually* hurt him but enough to make him think I might.

“It comes every night at three,” he yelps. “I work the night shift, so I was the one who first noticed. They come asking for Lucy, saying the hotel is theirs.”

I release him. “Three?”

He nods vigorously. 

“What's your name,” I ask.

“CJ.”

“Well CJ, I've decided I like you. Much appreciated.”

I stroll back to my room to take a shower and a nap in preparation for my confrontation tonight.

Apparently, my life philosophy is correct, after all.

Violence is always the answer.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Candace is waiting for me when I return to the grand lobby five minutes to three. The great chandelier has been dimmed for the night.

“Isn't it past your bedtime?” I ask her. “We all know how cranky you get.”

She rises from a waiting bench, nostrils flaring. “I *knew* you were lying. I just *knew* you were trying to sabotage me!”

“Lying? Well, duh. But sabotage? Shall I remind you, I hate it here. *I* was the one who quit.”

“I'm the one Grant left in charge, not you!”

“Except he didn't. Grant disappeared. He didn't give you his office, and he didn't give you the keys to the kingdom.”

“He trusts me!”

CJ stands behind the receptionist desk, looking nervously between the two of us like a child who will very soon have to decide custody between two warring parents. It's a nasty comparison to make―then again, no hate can ever match the hate between two family members who've stopped loving each other.

“I'm done with this.” I shoulder past her, headed for the nearest sofa to settle in for my wait. 

My head jerks. I stumble backwards, yanked by my hair.

*No. You. Did. Not.* 

What follows, though I experience profound embarrassment to admit, can only be described as an all-out *catfight*. We don't punch. We slap. We don't kick. We claw.

“Uh guys,” CJ says.

I yank at Candace's shirt. She shoves her hand in my mouth, and I bite down hard.

“Guys.”

“*You little―”* she shrieks.

“*You ungrateful―*” I spit back.

*“ ―jealous of me―”*

*“ ―can’t see what he's done to you―”*

“Guys, she just walked past,” CJ says.

We freeze in time to see somebody disappear into the hallway.

I swear and release Candace from her chokehold. She jumps up after me. 

“Don't go,” she says. Despite our fighting, despite our loathing from just moments ago, her eyes are suddenly open in pleading. She isn't just being petty. A part of her is genuinely concerned for my safety.

I go anyway.

The carpet muffles my steps as I half-sprint, half-sneak after the intruder. They disappear around another corner just when I get close, but I manage to gather crucial details. They move soundlessly, human-shaped, reeking of something distinctly chemical. The scent of a funeral home, perhaps? Embalment.

I follow the thing through hallways and conference rooms, not daring to call out. At times, it disappears, but always I manage to find it.

It's silent. Most residents are asleep by now. The bustle of business and visitation has trickled to nothing. Even the lobby music has been turned off. 

*It should hear me*. 

I'm sure of it. I'm not bad at sneaking, but I'm no expert. My combat boots shuffle on the carpet, and at one point I jostle a hallway table. Never once does the thing look back.

 “*Hungry*,” I catch a few times. “*Feed*.” And just once*:*  “*Lucy,*” 

Why hasn't it noticed me? It's almost like the thing is too… *focused* to care.

My sense of dread grows.

Eventually, the thing arrives at a set of silver swinging doors in an employee corridor―the kitchen doors, if I remember right. It pushes at them. When they don't budge, the thing shoves at them with both palms and they fly apart. Shards of metal from the busted lock spray inwards.

“*Feed,*” it moans and enters. 

For the barest of moments, I hesitate. This thing: it isn't my problem. I shouldn't be here. Not even *Grant* is here, so why should I risk myself on something impossibly strong that even the staff is terrified of? For one moment, I almost leave.

Then the screaming begins.

I swear and spring forward.

Something grabs me. I flail back, but the attacker is too quick and I'm taken by too much surprise.

“Get off!”

Candace shoves her forearm against my neck, and I struggle to free my windpipe. She was never as brutal as I was, but she grew up at Hotel Denouement the same as me; she knows how to take care of herself.

“It’s too late,” she says.

“Who's in there?” I gasp. The screaming continues.

“I told him not to work late this week, but he’s been so anxious about the gala. He’s been prepping everything and freezing it in advance.”

The Berner Charity Gala. I haven't thought about it in so long, but Denouement has put it on every January since…well forever. Food preparation takes nearly the whole week.

“Worker?” I choke out.

“Spencer,” Candace says.

Our cousin. Spencer is only a year or two older than me. I hadn't known if he was still working here.

“I told him.” Her eyes are watering. “I *told* him not to come in past midnight, and now it’s too late―nothing to do.” The screaming continues. Her arm is still against my throat, but the pressure has almost completely lifted. I’m tempted to shove her off me and sprint for the kitchen.

Instead, I gently lower her arm. “We can’t leave him,” I say.

“If we go, she’ll get us too.”

“If this is your hotel, then it’s up to *you* to protect the family. You can’t just leave him.”

Candace glances between me and the shuddering, silver kitchen doors. Slurping noises come from beyond them. She’s trembling.

Slowly, carefully, in such a soft manner even Grant would have admired my tact, I extricate myself entirely from Candace’s hold.

“If you won't, then let me,” I say. “*Please.*”

 She swallows. A tear streaks from one eye. Finally, she nods.

I approach the doors.

By some miracle, they make no sound as I push through, no squealing or creaking. Only the emergency light is on. Sharp shadows divide rows of industrial, stainless steel tables. Flour covers one, a glob of dough in the center. Knives and rolling pins are strewn across another, and the scent of baking rolls warms the kitchen.

A dark figure at the opposite end is hunched over something. I can’t see the thing, but it’s obvious what. The screaming from before has lessened to a low, tortured moan. A few more steps and I have a clearer view of the scene.

My cousin Spencer is sprawled across the tile. His chef's apron is ripped open. So is his stomach. Darkness pools out of him, puddling beneath. He should be dead with a gash like that, but still he whimpers feebly. Above him, the crouching figure pulls something long and sinuous from the wound. *Intestines,* I think for a sickening moment.

But no. The long string is glowing faintly, too fine and silvery for any sort of internal organ, so what is it? The figure pulls out more and more in a constant stream, but the end never comes. They shove it in their mouth occasionally, moaning with satisfaction, but always tugging out more.

“*Please*,” Spencer moans.

“Where is Lucy?” The figure demands.

“Not here―please―she’s not here.”

“Where is Grant?”

“Gone.” Spencer whimpers. “Somebody else is managing his hotel.”

“Wrong! This is my hotel. Mine!”

I creep forward, grabbing one of the discarded cutting knives as I do. I’m close enough to make out Spencer better now. 

He’s older than I remember. He should be mid-twenties, but his face is middle-aged, rough skin and visible wrinkles, hair greying. That can’t be right. Even as I think it, the attacker shoves another handful of the shimmering thread in its mouth and slurps.

Spencer ages before me. Skin sags. Chunks of hair fall out. His voice as he pleads becomes breathier with an aged tremor. 

The figure isn’t eating him. They’re stealing his life.

“It’s your hotel,” my cousin agrees. “Please, I don’t know where Lucy is.”

“Liar!”

“*Please*.”

I don’t wait any longer. In one fluid motion, I snarl and lunge at the figure with my knife, aiming for the throat. The blade penetrates―

It snaps at the hilt.

There’s time to notice only the faintest of scratches on the attacker’s neck―the sum total result of my heroic attempt at a rescue―before the figure whirls. They rise to a stand, seize me by my throat, and hurl me backwards. I slam against a metal island. All air slams out of me, but I manage to stumble and remain upright. 

Whatever this more-than-human is, it's strong. Not just strong, *invincible*. My attack barely harmed it. Behind it, Spencer gives a wet gurgle, a sound I’ve heard from countless of our residents. The splutter of a thing dying. 

Candace was right. There’s nothing I can do to save my cousin. 

There’s nothing I can even do to save myself.

“What do you want?” I demand anyway. 

“*Everything*.”

The figure steps towards me, out of a dark patch and into the gloom of the emergency light. I get a clear image of their face, and for perhaps the first time today, the first true pangs of terror course through me.

The person is Cynthia. My aunt. 

The one I[ killed myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/)
