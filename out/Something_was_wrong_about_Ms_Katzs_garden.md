When I first met my neighbor, Ms. Katz, she scared the shit out of me.

I was walking up the cracked sidewalk to her front door to introduce myself because I had just finished moving in and wanted to start getting to know my neighbors. The house was uniquely large compared to all of the other homes on the street; adorned with steep slanted roofs and vertical wooden framing, a cacophony of plants bursting over the back yard fence on either side.

It was the house that ended the street; the pavement of the road and sidewalk abruptly cut off into grass.

The door was thick wood that looked like it weighed a ton. The brass gargoyle door knocker rapped loudly, echoing into the house as I stood for a moment waiting for a reply. I jumped when a creaky voice from my left said,

“Hello there Deary.” I turned to look down at a cheery old woman’s face that was wrinkled in a closed-eyed smile. I was startled, it felt like she had scared me on purpose.

The backyard gate slammed shut and I noticed that the old woman was wiping dirt off of her hands; she must have been gardening. “Hello to you as well! I just moved in next door.” I said, trying to be friendly.

“Welcome to the neighborhood, my name is Catrina Katz, just call me Katz deary.” She opened her eyes and continued smiling, but I was taken aback again. Her eyes were yellow. Very yellow. They looked like sickly saucers of spoiled milk. My apprehension turned to empathy for Ms.Katz - yellow eyes can mean liver problems, something my own grandmother had struggled with it for years.

“I just wanted to say hello, I am going to go get back to unpacking, you should come over for dinner sometime! Nice meeting you,” I said.

“I’m sure I will deary,” Ms.Katz said, then she turned back towards the backyard gate, glancing one more time at me before getting to her gardening, and I went back to my new home, which was filled with boxes that needed my attention.

That night I slept poorly, the house was dead quiet, the only noise was the air conditioning unit kicking on every once in a while.

I am a very light sleeper, so that’s why I woke up when a strange noise started permeating through the edges of my sleepy consciousness.

There was a sound so quiet that a normal person would have slept through it. I lay covered in my bed, sensitive ears straining to discern what the noise was. It sounded like someone was digging in mud.

I sat up, trying to quiet my breathing so I could hear where it was coming from, but my wooden floors made the sound reverberate from all directions in my room. I could not work up the courage to get out bed and investigate, something told me I should just lay down and put on some white noise to ignore it.

Every night for a week did just that, ignoring the noise and getting some decent sleep.

When I asked my other neighbor Todd - a nice middle-aged truck driver- one day if he had heard the noise he said he didn’t know anything about it,

“I bet you it’s Ms. Katz. You can catch her out pretty late sometimes. Between you and me, I think she has a bit of dementia. Just a bit. She loves her gardening. I’ve even seen her doing it at night which is weird but to each their own. She must love it. She imports special fertilizer all the time. Here comes a truck now.” He nodded towards her house.

A van pulled into the driveway. It had a purple flower logo on the metal siding that was indeed befitting of a fertilizer company. A burly man dressed in all black greeted Ms. Katz at her gate and started carrying brown sacks into her back yard. She noticed us watching and gave a cheery wave to us, while we waved back Todd said,

“Really sweet woman. I’ve known her for years. She’s been living on Belmont Avenue as long as anyone can remember. Makes great apple pie.”

I decided to see the garden for myself that afternoon.

I made it look like I was cleaning my gutters, which to be fair, were disappointingly dirty no thanks to my landlord. I stood up on my roof to peer over the bushes spilling into my back yard, only then realizing what a jungle Ms. Katz’s backyard was. Bushes, flowers, vines, short and tall trees, birdbaths, stone pathways, you name it. If Ms. Katz was really doing it all herself, it had to have taken up all of her time. The garden was in pristine condition and scattered throughout the yard were the large brown fertilizer sacks, some ripped open with black soil spilling out.

There was a smell that rose out of the backyard and drifted towards me as I studied the garden. A sickly-sweet stench that was quite pungent. I could see lavender, rose and dracaena flowers so it was possible they were responsible for the strange odor.

Something was wrong though. A part of my brain was reminded at the time of how my grandfather’s large liquid fly traps smelled when they were full to the brim with dead insects. I was also reminded of rancid meat you discovered had been molding in the back of your fridge for weeks.

An itch on the back of my neck grew while I was scouting. It took me a minute to notice the yellow eyes peering at me between large purple curtains out of the corner of my vision. I was startled and turned to look back at Ms.Katz, unsure of how long she had been staring at me. She waved and smiled, nodding towards her garden like It was quite special before going inside.

I couldn’t be sure but before I turned to face her I could’ve sworn she was looking at me with a face contorted in utter hatred.

It was 9 nights ago when I watched Ms. Katz die.

When I woke, I was confused. I could make out the soft noise from nights before that still somehow demanded every ounce of my attention. I looked to my nightstand and realized my phone was not playing my white noise, I must have forgotten to turn it on.

I decided it was time to confront Ms. Katz. If she really did have dementia, maybe I could just talk to her and she would realize she should be asleep and not doing whatever weird shit she was doing in the middle of the night.

I crept through the house, slowly opening the back door. The sound of crickets and rustling leaves mixed with the digging noise that was now sharp and clear. I could not stop myself from approaching a peephole in the fence.

When I was a few spans from the fence the sound suddenly stopped. I froze, waiting. A rhythmic thumping noise started coming down over the fence. What was she up to now? I had to know what she was doing. One eye closed, I peered through the hole into the back yard. 

The back yard looked like it did when I last saw it, winding stone paths now illuminated by moonlight. More fertilizer bags were open and the garden beds were torn up like plants were being rearranged.

I quickly found her. Ms.Katz was on a ladder pulling at one of the fertilizer bags which was stuck in one of her second story windows. Pulling does not properly describe the motion. Ms. Katz was throwing her body weight faster than what seemed possible away from the window, the bag inching with each heave. She thrashed again and again and again. It looked like it hurt. It looked like her arms should have dislocated.

I started panicking, clearly Ms. Katz had more than “a little bit of dementia” like Todd had said. I needed to help her, to get her to a hospital and make sure she was mentally sound. But it was too late.

Suddenly Ms. Katz lost her grip on the bag, the cloth tearing from the tensile force, and in an instant was falling off of the ladder. She was weightless, air whipping her stained nightgown about while she plummeted. A pit formed in my stomach when I saw where she would land, the inevitable becoming more terrifying with each second.

*SPLAT.*

One of the short concrete bird baths that had a pointed house had completely pierced the abdomen of the elderly woman. I stood frozen while I processed what was happening.

Not a single cry was uttered. Her death was instant, a hole the size of a basketball oozing blood where her stomach had been made me fall to knees and retch into the grass.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 as I started frantically searching for my dinky ass Walgreens first aid kit. An operator picked up.

The operator asked in a calm voice,

"911 what is your emergency?"

“My neighbor is dead! She fell off a ladder and impaled herself on a bird bath!" I yelled, panting as I sprinted down the sidewalk.

The operator was clearly used to these kinds of calls, “Ok slow down sir. What is the address?”

“- redacted address-. Please hurry! Please!” I stammered out as fast as I could,

“What is her name sir?”

“Catrina Katz. She’s bleeding please-”

“Sir, is this a joke?”

“What do you mean? I’m telling you the truth”

I stopped in my tracks. I was so high on adrenaline I couldn’t understand what was happening.

“We’ve had at least eight calls like this in the past year. Ms. Katz has always been fine when we respond.”

“I don’t understa-“

“She is an elderly lady who does not need this harassment. I will not repeat myself. If you call again, I am sending an officer to arrest you for misuse of the 911 line. Goodbye.” The operator hung up.

The only sound left was my heavy breathing. I found myself walking towards the backyard gate, my momentum was the only thing that kept me going.

I pushed open the gate, scanning the backyard. There was no ladder laying on the ground.  Ms.Katz was gone. Somehow she was not skewered on the bird bath as she had been a minute ago. I kept moving forward, unable to stop myself from approaching the bird bath.

It was clean, its undisturbed state mocked my fear and panic. There was no blood, but when I touched the concrete bird bath house, it was warm.

I felt a pit in my stomach; the world was spinning around me. My head was pounding.

“Deary, what are you doing this time of night?” a sweet voice said, I whipped around. I felt like I was sinking into hysteria. 

The back door stood open, the wooden arch frame filled by Ms. Katz’s figure. There was no obvious sign of a gaping stomach wound, she appeared to have just woken up. She was looking at me, concern plain on the wrinkles of her face.

I could see into the house. A few old lamps were turned on. I could just make out old some ornate furniture covered in dust. The inside of the house certainly matched the outside.

There was something that caught my eye. It was one of the large fertilizer bags with the purple flower logo. Torn open and spilling over a wooden table onto the floor, the bag was not full of black soil. The bag was full of a bright flesh, indiscriminate chunks glistening in the lamp light.

“DEAR! I SAID ARE YOU OK?”, Ms. Katz yelled, snapping my eyes away from the bag of flesh. She was no longer a sweet old woman who wanted to make sure I was alright, her yellow eyes were strained open, demanding an answer from me, an explanation,

“I uh… I thought…” I stood there, mouth working, I couldn’t think. “I heard some commotion, I wanted to make sure everything was alright,” I stammered out, it seemed impossible that I was talking to someone that I just saw die. I felt nauseous. Doubt was flooding my mind. Was this real? Was I dreaming?

Ms. Katz’s face eased into her usual sweet smile,

“No commotion deary. I promise you everything is alright. Go back home and get some rest. I am sure you will forget all about it in the morning” She looked at me, still smiling, but the smile did not reach her eyes, “it’s late. People go missing at night so you better be careful.”

She turned and slammed the door.

I did not sleep that night. Instead, I turned on every light in the house and locked myself in my bedroom. I played the events of the night over and over again in my head. Every time I convinced myself it was real, I would convince myself I must have dreamed it; had some kind of lucid nightmare. But nightmares don’t leave 911 calls on your phone history or dirt strung throughout your house. Nightmares don’t live next door.

In my shaken state come morning the only thing to do was to go to work. Work was consistent, and I figured it would sort things out for me to pretend everything was normal.

After I downed a third cup of coffee I strode out the door, the sun catching on morning fog welcomed me to a new day.

Todd stepped out of his door right after me. We nodded to each other, Todd’s expression soured when he saw something behind me. “None of my damn business,” Todd grumbled around a cigarette in his lips. I turned to see what he had seen.

A van with a large purple flower logo was backed up to Ms. Katz’s house, a few men unloading fertilizer bags. A part of me wanted to be drawn back into the events of last night. I pushed it down.

I decided Todd was right. It was not any of my business.

A full day of work set me back to a sense of normalcy. Pushing pencils for eight hours really clears your mind.

That night was silent, and I slept sounder than a hibernating bear without the need for a white noise machine. I waved to Ms. Katz when I saw her on my excursions out of the house. She often was garbed in gardening clothes, going in and out of her backyard. None of my business. For six days all was well.

Until I woke up three nights ago, soaked in sweat, muffled screaming filling my room.

I once had a friend of mine lose his arm. We were playing on some rocks in a forest during a camping trip, jumping back and forth between larger boulders, taking turns giving chase to one another. I was laughing while I chased my friend, both of us grinning ear to ear while we played.

My friend was climbing higher and higher up the slope of the mountain, taking each gap in one big stride at a time, taunting me to catch him. Just before my little pointer finger could reach out and tag him, he lost his footing and slipped.

I watched as my friend fell towards the ground below, and stood frozen as he began screaming in pain, bloody arm raised in the air, bone snapped in half at the forearm, sharp white bone dangling in two directions.

I had never heard so much pain expressed before. My friend screamed until his voice was raw, thrashing about on a rock below. If I had acted sooner, running down the mountain to grab our parents, my friend might have saved his arm. But as a kid I just stood frozen to the spot, unable to move.

I was frozen then, in my bed, as I listened to the pain unfolding before me.

“Help me please! Oh god! Oh god!”, it was muffled, the words could just barely be made out, but the pain was sharp and visceral.

A part of me wanted to roll over, turn on the white noise machine, and pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But I knew what I was going to do.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, forcing myself to take one step after another towards the house next door. There was no doubt this time. This was real. I needed to be braver, to not freeze, to help this person. The screaming grew clearer as I approached the house, slid through the gate and approached the back door.

“I’m so sorry! I promise….” the voice screeched. It was definitely coming from her house, I had to stop whatever was going on. I reached for the door,  knife held at the ready, swallowing when my hand grabbed the knurled knob and began to twist.

“I cant! I..”, the yelling suddenly cut off, stillness now deafening. Somehow the hinges of the door slid across each other smoothly, silently revealing the darkness of the house. Once inside, I let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding as quietly as possible.

I moved through the room, past the old furniture, subconsciously aware of the bags of flesh strewn about, of the smell of death so rank I would normally empty the contents of my stomach. Passing old pieces of furniture covered in must, I found myself walking on kitchen tile, then rounding a doorway to face a steep wooden stairway.

Time started falling forwards on a fixed track, I was floating up the stairs. I barely noticed the loud thud that sounded like a deflated basketball was dropped.

Heat radiated from above, I was entering a tropical oven. The plaster of the walls was damp and rotted, wood molding visible in bare patches. A squelching noise started coming from upstairs and washing down over me.

I continued to move slowly towards the noise. At the top of the stairs was a hallway with closed side rooms and an open door at the end of the hall, the room behind the door illuminated by a sickly yellow ceiling light creeping out into the hall. Before I knew it I swung the door open, revealing the horrible scene inside.

It has taken me these days since that night to rationalize what I saw behind the door at the end of the hallway. In the moment my brain put my body into shock, I continued to act but was not comprehending how absolutely horrifying it all was.

The floor was covered in dirt and flesh. The two substances were mixed together to form a paste that was thick and gelatinous.

Ms. Katz’s head was staring at me, upside down in the mush, eyeless sockets fixed in my direction. The decapitated head looked something like a pale Jack-O-Lantern after weeks in the sun, all of the flesh had been scooped out from the inside. I could see through the eye sockets into the pale skull. The base of the head where the neck should be revealed a perfectly calcified circle that looked like a doll head might when you wrung it off of the body, a spacious cavity where a brain should be.

I peeled my eyes from the ground and looked forward.

A table was in the middle of the room. The rest of Ms. Katz was hunched over the table sitting on an old wooden stool. Her body was convulsing as something I couldn’t see was ripping into the chest of a dead body sprawled on the table. It must have been the person I had gone to save. Slurping and crunching filled the room.

There was screaming, it took me a second to realize that I was screaming.

Slowly the rest of Ms.Katz sat up from the table in the chair, out of the stump of her neck what looked like a slender frayed rope started stretching upward towards the ceiling. Brown and glistening like an insect carapace, slowly its head started rising from the dead body on the table, pulled upward until it was almost touching the ceiling. Tendrils roughly a foot in length sprouted like fuzzy antenna in all directions along the vine-like neck; they constantly moved and twitched as they felt their surroundings.

The head was covered in the same wriggly feelers, blacker than those on the neck. Once the head had risen almost five feet in the air, towering above me as an unholy obelisk, it twisted around to stare down at me.

Insect mandibles twitched and chomped, flesh smeared and stuck to the mouth area, falling down to the ground with thick splashes. The head was smaller than the discarded shell of a head on the ground by my feet, but the eyes were the same. The yellow eyes were large, bulging out of the hard carapace, no eyelids to conceal their bulbus shape. Its eyes were fixed on me, pure malice penetrating me to my core.

The next few moments occurred in the blink of an eye. Rapidly the tendrils of the neck started pulling the creature back into Ms. Katz. Each tendril would shoot down into the old woman’s body, accelerating the head downward. Sporadic jerks animated the her corpse, arms shooting out, a seizure of movements unfolding before me until the insectoid head was the only visible part of the parasite, resting on the body’s neck stump.

All was still, a standoff had begun. In shock I was rooted to the spot, a pit of dread opened up in my stomach and I became aware of my heart pounding in my ears.

It leaped toward me, pushing off the ground so hard I heard the floor break, crashing into me with force enough to break my ribs, sending us hurtling back through the hall way towards the stairs. On the ground we struggled, I somehow managed to grab its shoulders and pushed with all of my strength as it tried to pop my head open with its layers of jaws.

A full throated roar came out of me and I heaved us down the stairs. Each step smacked on the way down, at the bottom I rolled into the kitchen onto my back. I had broken ribs and an ankle twisted the wrong direction, so all I could do was crawl backwards from the stairwell door, where I could hear snapping sounds that meant it was getting up.

It forced Ms.Katz body to its feet, one arm disolacted and jutting upward, standing naked in the dark doorway. A fleshy stomach hole was filled with twisted knots of insectoid spaghetti where the bird bath had pierced through the body.  Its eyes were two yellow orbs of light swaying back and forth in the darkness of the doorway.

I noticed a shovel at my feet and frantically grabbed for it. I was too late. In the same moment I made my move, some of the knotted tendrils of Ms. Katz’s stomach wound shot out towards me.

The wet tendrils were thick and flew across the kitchen, striking my left shoulder and digging into my flesh. The muscles of the arm seized. My muscles were forced to contract harder than my brain would allow. Every single muscle cramped at the same time. My biceps relaxed as my triceps continued to flex which caused my arm to hyper extend. Bones cracked and my arm broke. I cried out in pain.

“Oh deary, I love the way you scream” it spoke to me with a voice that was broken, full of hateful mirth. It sounded like Ms. Katz was speaking while gargling crumbled bones. Suddenly my biceps flexed, snapping my arm the other way, my limp hand smacking into my shoulder. All I could do was grind my teeth and moan.

With my free arm holding the shovel I swung at the tendrils, severing them. It let out an ear blistering screech, insectoid head thrashing. Enraged, it crouched then lunged for me once more. I was ready this time.

Screaming my throat raw, I swung the shovel and hit it right between its eyes. One instant the shiny black mouth was going to tear my throat out, the next the carapace exploded, green slop flying in all directions. The body went limp and oozed all over me, tendrils seeping out over me onto the ground. The pungent smell of Ms. Katz body, old perfume, and rotting insect meat singed my nostrils. I could barely breath with all of the weight bearing down on me.

My shock wore off and panic set in. I frantically tried to push the corpse off of me, my hands slipping again and again, suffocating instigated desperation deep within me allowing me to drain the last of my strength to finally roll it off myself. Then I lay alone in the silent house.

I started sobbing. I took massive uncontrollable heaves of air into my body and let them out through tears and groans. I could not stop until every last possible emotion had been wailed out of me.

Once I was done, I stood numbly, used the shovel to limp my way out of the house, and packed a bag. I got into my car and rode out at dawn.

After a stop to the local urgent care where I told a true enough story about a bad fall down some stairs, I had a boot for my foot and bandages for my ribs. I drove as far as I could and stopped at a motel.

Three days later I am now writing from my third motel, slowly making my way back home, where I am going to try to forget all of this mess, and start over.

I am not sure what happened to Ms. Katz’s house or the bodies inside, and I don’t care. I needed to tell my story online because no one I know will believe me and because I am not sure if I will live to tell the tale anyways.

Every motel that I have stopped at has the same van that parks in the back of the lot at 3 am when I should be asleep and not notice. A van with a purple flower logo. They leave at 6 am before I should wake up.

I noticed each time because I have not slept since that night. I know I have nightmares waiting for me when I finally crash, but I am not ready to face them yet.
