Have you ever thought about something so far out of left field that nobody could possibly know you were thinking about it, only for the same topic to show up as a targeted ad or as part of casual conversation moments later? 

It'd always happened to me more often than felt normal, but only one of those daydreamy bouts of contemplation led me to my current job. Midday was approaching at a glacial pace when the idea of becoming a flight attendant wormed its way into my bored, desk-bound mind. Sure, I'd mostly be dealing with the same type of annoying person 30,000 feet higher than usual, but I would quite literally have the world at my feet. A few years of toughing working weekends and holidays out to a more senior position and I'd be grand.

My boss walking by and leaning in over my shoulder snapped me out of my daze and the fleeting thought remained as any other during a given day. Fleeting. The day continued as any other and I made my way home for another night of laying in bed and watching old sitcom reruns as had become tradition. A few hours later I headed to bed only to find a small manila envelope lying on my nightstand. It wasn't there when I'd gotten home, that much I was certain of, and so I cautiously approached and slipped out the contained letter. 

"FLIGHT ATTENDANT ROLE AVAILABLE OUT OF [REDACTED] INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. INITIAL TRIAL SHIFT THIS SATURDAY, BOARDING PASS ATTACHED. ALL NECESSITIES PROVIDED, BRING PASSPORT ONLY."

I took a risk for the first time in my sheltered, seemingly pre-determined life and showed up at the airport that weekend. The outright strangeness of the entire proposal wasn't lost on me, but I didn't care. A part of me might have even been spurred on by it. The process that Saturday went as usual except I, of course, didn't have anything with me and I didn't know where I was going. Like one of those "mystery flights" except it was dumbfoundingly also a job interview of some kind. The check-in agent directed me to gate 6 and I made my way there with a nervously excited haste. 

The typical stuff followed, except I and a few other people were given uniforms and a 5-minute briefing before boarding. I suppose they wanted to see how quick on our feet we were as part of that first shift, as well as making it clear that we would be very well compensated. We had one rule drilled into our heads. Stay at the front of the aircraft for the first thirty minutes of flight time and keep your heads fixed towards the cockpit. A little weird, but no biggie I silently thought. It was supposed to be a flight attendant role but all they really asked us to do beyond those first thirty minutes was stand around and make sure everybody got off the plane at our destination. Except us. They made it very clear that we were never to deplane unless at our home airport. There went the dream of sunrise over a pretty shoreline and dinner in a fancy downtown restaurant hundreds of miles away. I resigned myself to thinking about how good the money was. 


I will never forget getting onto that first flight and realising it was empty, that *none* of the people standing with us at the gate had gotten on before departure. That the people who gradually appeared as if they'd always been there in ever-growing numbers must have boarded from somewhere... else. The knowing looks on the faces of all those seated people. Some of them pled, some screamed and others just gazed off beyond the headrest in front of them and into parts unknown. Funnily enough, that first flight was the only time we didn't have to drag someone off the plane kicking and screaming. I suppose they threw us a deliberate softball and knew we would learn to put up with the tougher passengers further down the line. The return flight was uneventful and I spent the night recalling some of the names I'd seen on the manifest, both out of genuine curiosity as well as a need to confirm the reality I'd stepped into, a reality that I learned nobody was to ever explicitly confirm. Endless Google searches later I'd arrived at the answer I'd already known, the passengers onboard were dead. The expressions worn on their faces told the rest of the story. Given we weren't permitted to bring anything except our passports with us, I had only managed to memorise ten of the thirty or so names on the manifest, but the sample size was large enough to testify as to the very real nature of what I'd been thrown into. 

As if scheduled to coincide with my desire to back out, the payment for my first flight arrived in my bank account with a satisfying ding notification. "*I couldn't possibly walk away from this much money*", I thought to myself, "*besides, all I'm doing is standing guard for people who would be going there anyway*". 

Naïve at best, downright immoral at worst. There was no real way I knew everybody on board deserved to be going to hell. I wasn't omniscient, nor did I have the ability to determine the criteria for something so... final. 

And yet, I pressed forward. 

Past a certain point, I lost track of how many shuttles I'd stood watch over. The guilt still gnawed at me and I had a great many sleepless nights. Sometimes I'd see the faces of those onboard silently judging me from beyond. 

Just one more flight I told myself. Just one more, then I can pay off my car. Just one more and I can move into a nicer place. 

Just one more. 

My final flight was yesterday. I don’t think I can ever be on that shuttle again. At least not out of choice.￼￼

Nothing out of the ordinary happened between waking up in the morning and the passengers blinking into this liminal existence once we were high above the clouds. But then I heard him. An elderly man in row six with a frail voice was calling my name. Not endlessly pressing the call button, not shouting for a flight attendant, not even a general call for help. This was something new entirely.

He was calling for me.

My heart sank below what I thought to be possible and my body subsequently froze. Something screamed at my every instinct to stay exactly where I was, to pretend I hadn’t heard that voice beckoning me. Daring me to find out why. I still don’t know how long I remained in this state before I felt the cold touch of a bony hand on my shoulder and a whisper in my ill-prepared ear.

“*You aren’t supposed to be here yet*”.
