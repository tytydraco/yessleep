Howdy Journal, still practicing my writing skills, Sadie says it'll help me "not be such a dickhead" whatever that means. Anywho, I met up with Kenny last night to rebuild my hunting stand, place gave me the heebie geebies hooo golly, BIG open field looks like its seperated from the rest of town, reeeeal secluded. Im nervous to hunt here but im ready i got a few boxes of ammo for us. Hopefully we can just shoot the shit tonight after i leave work. Imma head there now and waste away with some rude ass old people.

Hi again Journal, We gotta get you a name if you gon be sticking around, what about Francois cause yer fancy-like. Lets start over, Hi again Francois, see you like it. Any way today at work was interesting i had a shift with Brandyn as i usually do and but Vic came in you remember Vic he dropped down on his knees buck naked and spoke some french nonsense, i should really find out what he said that night its a been a while and i didnt ever really try. Anywho, he was clothed this time but still fucking crazy he drank a gallon of milk and ate 3 fucking cartons of raw eggs shell and all, sounded like the birds were still alive in there. He was humming some song to himself while he did it, i walked up behind him and said,

Me:"Vic you gotta pay for all that"

Mother fucker was still eating and still humming, so i grab his shoulder and start to say,

Me:"Vic you HAVE to pay or you HAVE TO LE..."

Drugged up bitch bit me, i punch him in his face and back up and screamed,

Me:"WHAT THE FUCK VIC! YOU USING MORE THAN USUAL? JESUS FUCK!"

He practically levitated off the fucking ground while he sang this fucking song,

"Je te vois lune, s'il te plaît, vois-moi
Je t'aime, la lune m'a libéré
Je te vois lune, tu me vois sourire
Je t'aime rougarou, ton amour règne violent"

I ran him off, he's still fucking crazy but not near me. The song haunted me all shift, like what kinda horror movie shit was that, he was singing like a god damn weirdo in a goddamn conjuring movie, shit. It got worse though, this time i did translate it, google translate atleast. It loosely translated to;

"I see you moon please see me
I love you moon set me free
I see you moon, see me smilin'
I love you werewolf, your love reigns violent."

Again i say what, the fuck?! Is he just tryna to be a fucking creep or something? You come up into a damn Dollar General tweaking in a fucking theatrical way, and spew some decoded cajun-french spooky shit. Talking about the moon and the Rougarou, a damn kids story parents told us to make sure we was good. Ruined my goddamn night man, anywho im waiting on KK to come pick me up for the night ill hit you after "Francois". You dont think imma dick head right? Didnt think so, that's why i like you my fancy french friend alright ill let you know how the night goes.

Hey "Francois", hunt didn't go well ill give the step by step. After i finished up my yapping bout Vic Kenny pulled i grabbed my rifle out the back of my truck like i have every wednesday night, we said nothing but a hey like we do every Wednesday night, its like we were saving the conversations for the stand. We get there a few minutes before midnight and set up. My radio was connecting to my phone when kenny said,

KK: "Naw man not tonight, tonights gonna be quiet. Plus im sick of Colter Wall"

I looked him up an down, and said,

Me: "But.....Colter Wall...."

Kenny glares at me and i back down, ill miss my music accompanying our drunken conversations. I reached down in Kennys bag hoping to lift out a bottle or a can but all i find is boxes and boxes of ammo for his rifle,

Me: "Yo KK where the fucks the beers, oh and why you got so many damn bullets?"

KK: "We gotta have bullets to hunt right? Our heads gotta be clear too."

More deadpan than usual he seemed off, like some bacteria was eating away at him internally, He worried me,

Me:" You alright man?"

He visibly tenses up while watching his side of the tree line, im watching mine. Tonight should've been normal, but he blows up on me like i had just insulted him,

KK:"I gotta fucking eat right? Caint afford no goddamn groceries so i gotta fucking hunt for my food like a real, GOD DAMN MAN!"

He bangs the side of the stand with his fist repeatly and just screams, 

"FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!"

The stand shook with each hit, the wood cracked slightly, the way he was yelling im sure half of the town heard him going off.
He finsihed up and i just look at him and say,

"Alright Damn, we can fucking hunt."

An hour of quiet watching passes, scaning the treeline back and forth. Those stars in the trees taunting us as if they was saying "just shoot us, whats the worst that could happen." I start to agree and take aim between one of those glowing eyes, the frogs sing to me like they want me to feel like a god for taking this life. So dramatic that mother nature, so beautiful. My finger rests on the trigger, and Kenny slaps my shoulder. I look at him and follow him out of the stand, he says,

KK:"Look how goddamn beautiful that moon is brother."

I jolt my head out the door to look at the moon he was talking about. It didnt look like the moon i knew all my life filling damn near the whole sky. Blue light gave me love i had never felt and likely shall never feel again, KK puts his arms over my shoulders and sighs. 

KK:"Aint she a beaut?"

Me:"Sure is."

KK:"Viva La Luna."
 
I dont really understand what he says but i didnt plan on asking. After a moment of idle admiration the woods fall silent. I notice this, kenny does not. I circle my line of sight in a defensive way, making sure we aint snuck  up on. After a moment which felt like an eternity we hear it. A deep howl, It sounded like a man shrieking mixed with a wolf claiming victory over him, a big fucking wolf to. I rush inside the stand and grab my rifle i watch the tree line as usual, but this time it was different. This time the white glowing eyes i am typically met with are absent, i see one set now, one large set dead center of the tree wall. I fear we fell within a trap, anxious i keep my eye on it and call for kenny

Me: "Kenny get yer fucking ass up here."

Kenny stays where i left him, in that otherworldly moons sight. I jolt my head around and call for him again.

Me:"KENNY COME THE FUCK ON, WHAT'RE YOU DOING DUDE!?" 

This time Kenny manages to rotate towards the open door he's got the same maggot filled smile Vic had and he starts singing that same fucking song Vic sang. I turn back to the sun sized eyes i once saw, they were gone and follwed by heavy footsteps and branches breaking. I hold my rifle ready and dart out the door grabing Kenny and rushing to his truck. I hear that howl once again, i still hear it now. I drug Kennys heavy ass to the passenger side of his truck, luckily its a newer model so all i had to do was tap the button on the handle whenever the keys were near. I open the door toss him in circle around to the driver side and look back at the stand, leaving majority of our stuff. Before me i saw Sick fucking Vic under the moonlight singing and dancing. I could've shot him, i would've to be honest. But i left with Kenny, its around 2:40am and i'm just down the road from the spot when Kenny jolts awake screaming.

KK:"NO, FUCK NO STOP IT, IT HURTS LET ME GO HOME YOURE FUCKING CRA---"

I cut him off trying to calm him down,

Me: "KK STOP, STOP IT MAN WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!?"

Kenny slows his panic for a second and then completely calms down, almost like a flip of a damn switch.

KK:"Rog what the fuck are we doing, where we going man, wheres my shit!"

Me:" KK YOU FREAKED THE FUCK OUT WHILE STARING AT THE MOON STARTED SINGING IN FRENCH N SHIT-"

Kenny cuts me off mid-sentence, 

KK:"YOU SIR ARE FUCKING WITH ME I DO NOT KNOW FRENCH."

Me:"KENNY IM NOT FUCKING YOU WITH YOU LISTEN MAN, YOU FUCKING BLACKED OUT OR SOMETHING YOU WERE CRYING AND SMILING LOOKING AT THE MOON ARE YOU ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING? I SAW A BIG FUCKING WOLF TOO MAN, AND...AND VIC WAS THERE MAN WHAT THE FUCK?"

Kenny falls silent, most likely in shock. Soon we pass up my old hunting spot near the lodge, I stare at it the whole time we pass. We get back to my work and i head towards my truck. Kenny hops out and yells in my directions,

KK:"We still on for Wednesday?" 

I hop in my truck and drive off, it wasnt mature but i was scared and angry. Im at home right now putting my mind back together after this shit. Ill talk to KK tomorrow ill try to sleep tonight, i dont know if i can.

Goodnight Journal, talk to you tomorrow.

That's all he wrote im going back tonight, not much to say cept maybe hes going crazy, i dont think so but what he wrote isn't rational or real, ill update after my trip.
