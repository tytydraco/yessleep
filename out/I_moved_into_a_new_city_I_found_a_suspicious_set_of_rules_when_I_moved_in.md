For backstory, I was moving to a new city for job opportunities, hopefully in some well-paying company so I can move out of the apartment I previously rented. Though, this apartment is far worse. I was stuck in it for half a year.

I arrived at my apartment after an hour-long train ride, late in the evening. I went up the stairs and to my door relatively quickly, as I was incredibly tired. I eased up, finally at my new home, until I opened the door a sheet of paper on the floor. It read:

&#x200B;

*Rule 1: Do not talk or stare at anyone else in the building. It is extremely likely they are not human.*

*Rule 2: Under no circumstances touch or stare for a prolonged period of time at one of the paintings already here.*

*Rule 3: If you hear tapping at any window, turn off the lights and hide as far away from the tapping as possible.*

*Rule 4: Should the TV turn to static at any time, smash it immediately. Something is trying to escape.*

*Rule 5: Do not leave any windows open at any time.*

*Rule 6: Do not, EVER, go to the roof. It is extremely likely you will never return.*

*Rule 7: Never exit your apartment or leave it unlocked when it is dark.*

*Rule 8: Do not move out or rent/buy another residence until the contract is up.*

*Rule 9: If you hear constant rapping at the door, pray.*

*If you break any of these rules, your survival is uncertain. You may suffer a fate worse than death.*

&#x200B;

I thought, why are these here? Is this a prank? I decided, wisely, to follow the rules unless disproven. Lord knows what might've happened to me if I didn't.

Suddenly, I heard weak knocking at the door. A voice said "Hey, is anyone home? I want to-" My eyes widened. Rule 1. I paid no attention to what else they had to say. I practically leapt to the bedroom, spotted a closet, and sped into it and hid. After what felt like an eternity, the knocking stopped.

I breathed heavily and left the bedroom, and sprawled myself across the bed. I immediately fell asleep until I awoke somewhere around 8:30 AM. Finally, morning.

I leapt up, cursing my luck. I hoped this was all a nightmare. That is, until, I found a note on the bedside table. It read:

*Check the television.*

My breathing sped up. I could hear static in the living room right across. My eyes sped across the room, looking for something with which I could destroy a TV, until I saw some tools near the window that I was too tired to notice.

They had drops of blood on them, along with some bloodstains on the windowsill. I... hoped I would not share the same fate. I could feel the fear filling up the room, all from me. I felt so uneasy that I would just stick there, if I didn't know there was something unearthly to do with the television in the room over.

I grabbed a wrench and slammed the door open, seeing the television set filled with static, with a humanoid figure outlined on the static.

I froze. I sweated vigorously. I couldn't move, as if I was glued to the floor.

A head emerged from the television, 2 empty eyes staring directly at me, only making me more fearful. Some say I'm a coward, and this moment all but proves it.

I... I couldn't bear to think what might happen if it escaped, so I rushed towards it, before seeing a torso emerging through the screen. I then smashed the screen a few times, finally ending that nightmare.

A severed torso and head lay on the floor, soon phasing out of existance with that same static noise and look. I still remember those empty eyes, filled with nothing, absolutely nothing. It will scare me to my grave, yet, I had little to do to distract me - I just destroyed the television, one of my main sources of entertainment. I had some books in dusty boxes, perhaps I could make breakfast?

I moved over to the kitchen and remembered I had a few microwave meals in my car, thankfully there was a microwave in the flat. So, I exited the room, locked the door behind me and saw-

A person. Rule 1, again.

They talked indiscriminately, trying to catch my attention, but I simply held my head down and ignored them. By the time I got to the ground floor, they had stopped trying. I finally got to my car, and thought briefly about just driving off. This place is such a nightmare. But then my mind jolted forward: Rule 8. I'm stuck here for 6 months. God.

I took a few microwave meals and some soft drinks out of the car, and went up the stairwell. Phew, no people. I heard footsteps distantly, on the floor below, but I thought none of it.

I unlocked my door and locked it again, in the flat, and I emptied my hands into the fridge. I took a meal, some potato mash and sausages, I think, and put it into the microwave for about 5 minutes. I sat down and reflected on my experiences in the living room, before I heard something in front of me.

***knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock***

A rapping at the door. Rule 9.
