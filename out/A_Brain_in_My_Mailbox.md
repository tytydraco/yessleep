I had lived there for three months and had yet to unpack all of my belongings. Boxes were stacked in every room of the house with a few necessities laid aside. I had foraged around for my uniforms and some clothes to wear around the house, but I didn’t take the time to label each box. After an unnecessary amount of effort, I found one box with some books, my mother’s snow globe, and a small amount of clothes. I gave up on the rest of my wardrobe and bought a pack of underwear and socks.  I wore the same uniform five days a week and then a pair of jogging pants and a plain black tee shirt on the weekends. I did rotate the socks and underwear to maintain a semblance of cleanliness. Showers, few and far between. Even my boss complained about how I smelled. We had a lengthy conversation about it.

As soon as I moved into the house, something sinister come over me. I was sluggish and bored, drained completely of all concern, for either my health or appearance. I felt dead.

On a chill October afternoon, I came home from work, ready to put a troubling week behind me. It was a Friday, and I was excited to be able to lounge around on the couch for the next several hours watching tv. As usual, I had no plans for the weekend. I got out of the car and sauntered over to the mailbox. I pulled down the lid, but instead of parcels or letters, there was a human brain, lobes throbbing, blood coursing about, a grey lump of matter somehow imbued with life.

I slammed the lid shut, ran to the front door, and reached into my pocket, searching desperately for the key. No need, the door was slightly opened. It occurred to me that whoever had put the brain in my mailbox was now in my house. I am probably the one soul left in the world without a cell phone, else I would have called the police right then and there. Instead, against my better judgement, I decided to go inside.

I pushed the door open, slowly, hoping to mute the squeaking hinges and not alert the intruder to my presence. A sudden thought flashed through my mind- there was a shovel in my neighbor’s backyard. I could borrow it, use it as a weapon and return it. I stopped, the stupidity of my thinking and my train of thought shocked me. I should just go over to my neighbor’s house and call the police. Yet, unknowingly to me, the door gained momentum and crashed into the adjacent wall, as I pondered my newly formed plan.

Sitting on my couch was a tall slender man with the top of his head sawed off, right above his brow. He was holding my mother’s snow globe, staring at a small cottage, nestled in a miniature world of snowy mountains and a glassy sky. He looked up. He blinked his eyes incessantly, a twitch, seemingly out of his control. He opened his mouth to speak, but all I heard was a cacophony of undulating high- and low-pitched groans. It was gibberish, but he seemed satisfied with his message, and when he was done, his head slumped clumsily down, his chin resting against his chest, staring listlessly back into the globe.

I backed away, turned, and jumped down across the steps. I ran to my neighbor’s house and pounded against the front door. After a few minutes of uninterrupted knocking, the door opened.

“Hey partner, what’s going on. Everything ok?” My neighbor Fred was an elderly man. He never wore anything but a pair of overalls and a flannel shirt. At one time he told me he was a good and honest mechanic; a rarity seldom found these days. He was way beyond his years to ever work on cars again, but he was always willing to give advice or take a quick look under the hood.

“I have an intruder. Can I borrow your phone and call the police?”

“Sure buddy. Damn. He’s still in the house?”

“Yeah.” I didn’t want to divulge anything but the most basic of information. How would I explain that there was a man without a brain, sitting on my couch, holding a snow globe? The brain in the mailbox, that was beyond mentioning.

“Come on in the house. Safer in here.”

As I came in, he handed me his cell phone. “I don’t got a land line.”

I paced back and forth between the kitchen and the living room, as I talked to the police. Fred had gone upstairs, and I didn’t see him when he came back down again. I turned back again from the kitchen and bumped into him. I felt a sting in my belly and a warm sensation rise up through my chest. My arms and legs went numb. I fell back, losing my balance. Fred grabbed me by the wrist, gently lowering me to the ground. Before I lost consciousness, I noticed he was holding an empty syringe.

I woke up in my bed, my hands handcuffed to the headboard and my feet tied together. My vision was blurry, but I could see a hacksaw lying on the nightstand. I heard a squabble, three men arguing in an alien language. I lifted my head and squinted my eyes. It was Fred, a police officer, and the intruder. All three now had the tops of their skulls open and their brains exposed. They were pushing and pulling at each other, unaware that I was awake.

Fred turned and saw me watching.

“Well, looky, he’s awake. Sorry ole boy, but I need a new body. This one over here seems to think it’s his turn.”

“I made a claim on him first,” said the intruder, now able to talk coherently.

“Yes, and you were going to attack him from a mailbox, without your host. One hell of a plan,” replied the officer.

“It’s mine! I hate this body. It’s broken. It’s mine! I made the claim…” the intruder yelled, but in mid-sentence he started talking gibberish as the brain leapt out of his head and sprouted long, spindly legs. It crawled up my body all the way up to my chest before the officer grabbed it and slung it against the wall. He pulled out his pistol and shot it.

“This stays between us,” Fred advised.  He turned to me. “Don’t worry neighbor. I’m not as cruel as the others. I’m not going to kill you.”

He reached in his pocket and brought out another syringe. I kicked at him the best I could, but he dodged and moved further away. He approached the bed and again I kicked at him.

“Please,” I begged, “let me go.” Then I started screaming as loud as I could, hoping that someone would hear me. The officer punched me in the face.

“Now dammit, don’t do that. I want a pretty face.”

Suddenly, I felt a prick in my shoulder and the familiar warmth flowing into my chest.

“Now relax and get some rest. You’ll wake up a new man.”

I lost consciousness for the second time that day. I woke up in a strange place, on a sidewalk, next to a bus depot. There were spots before my eyes, and I felt nauseous and weak. I rolled over and vomited on the street.

“Get out of the damn street you stupid drunk,” I heard someone yell from a passing car.

A woman came over and helped me up.

“Are you alright? Do you need something?” She led me over to a nearby bench and as we passed by the depot I noticed my reflection in the window.

I was wearing overalls and a flannel shirt. My face was loose and wrinkled and what was left of my hair was white. I raised my hands several times, and dancing about, just to be sure. Yes, the reflection did and responded to everything I did. That reflection looked just like Fred.

“I have something for you.” The woman reached into her purse, pulled out a snow globe and handed it to me. It’s now the only reminder that I have that I was something other than an old drunk living on the streets. I sometimes shake it and imagine I’m in the cottage, asleep on a bed, next to a warm fireplace, in a faraway place, a wholly different life and yet, I can’t help to wonder that maybe I have been there. How many other bodies have I been in? How many other times have I imagined myself to be someone other than I am? How many other snow globes have I peered into, hoping for a better existence?
