This happened in August of 2024. I am not even sure if it counts as a “scary” story, but for me it definitely is. Part of why I want to tell the story is to warn women never to walk home alone at night, because you never know who you will run into and what intentions that person has. Let me start by saying; I was very lucky that night, despite it all.

I spent the evening with some close friends of mine, hanging out at my place at first, drinking some beer and having a good time. Later that evening we went to a local bar downtown. We drank, danced, laughed, sang karaoke and basically just had the best night of our lives. It’s sad that my memory of that night got sullied by what happened on my way home.

The bar closed at 2 am, after we had sung the last song for the night with the host of the karaoke night. My friend said she could walk me halfway home and then we would part ways at the local High School because we were going in opposite directions there. I was fine with that. I’ve never been afraid to walk home at night, because why would anything ever happen to me?

We walked together and at the school we parted ways, like planned. We thanked each other for an amazing night and I walked across the park right outside of the school, towards the big entrance where I would turn right. As I got closer to that turn I noticed someone coming up behind me on a bike. I didn’t think much of it, but thought it was strange since he didn’t pass me even though he should be a lot faster than me on that bike. I tried calling a friend, mostly because I felt social from being drunk and wanted someone to talk to, but he didn’t pick up.

Just as I was about to turn right by the entrance, the guy behind me parked his bike and ran up to me. He basically jumped in front of me and said “Hi!” I got a bit startled at first, but greeted him back. The first thing I noticed was his dark, smooth skin and his big smile. He had a kind face and looked quite young. He asked for my name and told me his. I was just being friendly and social as I was affected by the alcohol. He didn’t seem threatening in any way with his kind demeanor, slim body and that bright smile. I asked him which way he was going and since we were going the same way, I told him he could keep me company until we had to part. He agreed.

He grabbed his bike and walked next to me as he asked how old I was. I said I had just turned 30. He seemed a bit surprised by that and I asked his age and he said 20. We small talked a little about what we had done earlier that evening and stuff like that. Eventually he asked for my number, but I refused to give it to him. I said I don’t feel comfortable giving my number to strangers, but I could add him on facebook. He asked me to give him my phone as I opened the app. Then he searched for his name and pressed “add friend”. After this he said “You will never write to me though.” I promised him I would and he kept saying I wouldn’t. I couldn’t help but feel like he was acting a bit pathetic and he was starting to make me a bit uncomfortable.

We had walked together for about 10 minutes or less when we were about to part ways. I was going left and he was going straight. I said “It was nice to meet you and talk for a bit. Have a good night,” then I turned around to walk home. He said “Hey, come on. Give me a hug.” I was uncomfortable, but I agreed. One hug. I could manage that. But as I gave him that hug he grabbed me tight and held me as if we were a couple. I tried to push him away while smiling awkwardly and said “I have to go”, but he grabbed me even tighter and pressed his lips against mine. I pushed him away and told him “I don’t want to do this. I have a boyfriend.” He stepped back and looked at the ground with a frown, as if to make me feel sorry for him. Once again I couldn’t help but think he was acting pathetic.

My memory is a bit blurry about how everything went down exactly after this, but I’m pretty sure I said something about going home again before he grabbed me once more. This time he held one hand behind my back and the other at the back of my head, forcibly making out with me. I tried to push him away with both my hands, but he was surprisingly strong. He begged “Please, kiss me back. Why won’t you kiss me back?” I said “Because I don’t want to. Like I said, I have a boyfriend, and I just want to go home.” Then he said “But I love you. Don’t you love me?” I started to wonder how this person’s brain was wired. I said “No. I love my boyfriend, and I don’t even know you. You don’t know me either, so you can’t love me.” He replied that he does know me, and he does love me.

He kept making out with my closed mouth forcefully and pushed me against a fence, where he proceeded to fondle me in ways you shouldn’t ever do without consent. I just wanted to get away, but he was stronger than me. I wish I would have done more, but for some reason I didn’t. I didn’t kick him in the nuts, or punch him in the face. I just kept trying to push him away or break free from his grip, even though it clearly didn’t work. I asked him to stop and eventually he let go of me. I started walking away from him but he walked after me. I told him to stop and he asked if I had a cigarette. He said if I had one smoke with him, then I could go home and he would leave me alone, so I agreed. In my drunken state of mind I guess I wasn’t as scared as I had been if I was sober.

He walked up to me again and I told him to keep his distance. He stood close to me still, but at least he wasn’t touching me. I lit a cigarette and gave it to him, but he told me he doesn’t smoke. I was honestly just annoyed at this point. So I put the cigarette in my mouth and said “Well, I’m going home now. Have a good night. Bye,” and then I started walking. 

He walked behind me and I turned around and said “Stop following me! Just let me go home!” He asked if he could come with me to my place. I almost exploded. How dumb can someone be? I obviously said no and he asked why. I just replied “Because I don’t want you at my place!” Then he started whining again about how I was going to ignore his messages if he contacted me. I said I promised to reply if he messaged me, hoping he would leave me alone if he thought we’d be in contact again.

After a while he ran up to me and begged for “one last hug”. I said “You have gotten your last hug. Let me go.” As I tried to walk past him he grabbed me again and held me tight and kept trying to make out with me. I tried to run away but he grabbed me from behind. He forced my head back so that my chin was positioned over my shoulder, so he could keep making out with me from behind. At this point I started begging him to let me go. I could barely breathe as his thick lips and disgusting tongue covered half my face. I repeated “Please, stop,” as soon as I got the slightest chance to speak. I eventually kneeled to the ground as a means to escape his grip somehow, but that just put me in an even worse position as he forced me on my back on the cold ground. It was wet as it had been raining a lot during the night. I had dropped my half-smoked cigarette on the ground. I was watching the glow and smoke coming from it as the guy laid with half his body on top of me. I was done fighting and just accepted my fate. “After he’s done with me he will let me go home,” I thought to myself. 

After having touched my breasts for a moment he grabbed the zip tie to my jacket to open it, but I grabbed my jacket hard by the collar so that he couldn’t. Instead he started touching me “down there” and kissed my neck passionately. I was in a state of shock and panic. I just remember staring into the bushes, thinking that I had no choice but to accept what was happening. He kept an eye on the road all the time, obviously not wanting anyone to see what was going on. There was a roundabout not far from us and many roads for him to keep his eye on.

This is where I got lucky. By some miracle, at that moment, some random car came driving into that roundabout at almost 3 am. The guy stood up immediately and dashed towards his bike that he had left where we were first about to part ways. I looked for a second as he ran away, before I stood up and dashed in the other direction. I started crying and ran towards the roundabout. The car never saw me. I picked up my phone and called the friend that had followed me halfway home. It took a moment for me to calm down enough for her to even understand what I was saying. On my way home I told her about the whole situation and she was devastated to hear what had happened. She told me to call the cops as soon as I was inside my apartment, which I did.

The case is currently ongoing as I’m writing this. Luckily I had his name, address and approximate location to his home, so it didn’t take them long to find him. They have him arrested as we speak and I am waiting for an update as to when the trial will take place.

Wish me luck, and please, be careful out there.
