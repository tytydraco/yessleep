I recently bought a new home, I thought I was getting an amazing deal. A three bedroom house, a large office room, and a basement on the larger side, rather cheap in price as-well. That being said, it wasn’t exactly well kept, it could use some sprucing up, I planned on doing just that for several months, fixing it up and then deciding to flip it or rent the place. At first, everything in the house was normal and life continued. The odd creak in the floorboard, you know, just stuff to expect in a house that sat empty for a few years. Now, onto the stuff, we could be here all day.——————————————————— 17th of April 2025 — around two weeks after I moved in, I had decided to clean around the basement, after all I could renovate it into some sort of space, wasn’t sure on what, suppose it’ll come to me. anyway, i was tearing down some drywall along the far wall, thats when… I hit wood. Not the framing, it was a whole door, a really old, ugly, nasty looking door. So nasty, it looked sunken in, as if its been hidden for a very long time. No handle, just a keyhole and thick black hinges, they look rusted shut. I never saw it on the blueprints, a sub-basement wasn’t mentioned either. Being curious, I decide to pry open the door with a crowbar. Upon the door creaking open, I noticed immediately that there was a narrow staircase spiraling downward into pitch black. It didn’t make sense. The house only had one floor above ground and a shallow basement. I stood at the top of those stairs for a long time, flashlight in hand, just… listening. And I swear, I could hear something. Faint voices. Like a radio stuck between stations, whispering just below the range of human hearing, I should’ve closed the door right then and sealed it up. But I didn’t. And now, in the present time of writing this,

I don’t think I’m the only one living here anymore… Whatever, whoever, is lurking in the dark below, I don’t actually wanna know. I’m sure I heard some sort of incoherent mumbling too. For now, I am staying with a friend, will update when I decide to go back there, currently working up the nerve to do that now. Regardless of whatever it is, I’m hoping for some good clarity here. My mental state is taking its toll. 

——————————————————— April 21st 2025 — I have no words for this, at all. I found a letter in my mailbox this morning. No postage, no return address. Just my name written in handwriting that looks… too familiar. I opened it and found this note inside , which I sourced below… It reads: “Don’t go back down there. You weren’t the first me, and you won’t be the last.” I’m definitely lost now, I need help, I’m unsure what this means for me, I’ve just heard a clang from down there.
