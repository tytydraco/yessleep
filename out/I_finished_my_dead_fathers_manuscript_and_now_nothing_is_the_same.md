I didn’t think much about it when my father died. That probably sounds callous, but it’s the truth. We weren’t particularly close in the last few years. His obsession with that manuscript had consumed him, and I had grown tired of trying to pull him out of it. He’d been rewriting it for as long as I could remember, claiming it was the most important thing he’d ever create. "My legacy," he’d say, his eyes feverish, fingers trembling as they hovered over the keyboard. 

“This is what I’ll leave behind.”

When he passed, it wasn’t sudden. The doctors had said it would happen soon enough, and when the call came, I felt... indifferent. More relieved than anything. The strange thing was when we sorted through his things, we found the manuscript unfinished. He’d always sworn he was so close, just a page or two away from completing it, but there it was, scattered in hundreds of drafts and notes, half-formed ideas and scribbled-out paragraphs.

It was my sister, Claire, who suggested we finish it. She’s the sentimental one, always looking for ways to memorialize him, to make meaning out of nothing. “For his legacy, you know?” she said, her voice soft as if afraid to disturb the ghosts that lingered in his study. 

I should’ve said no. I should’ve known better. But at the time, it seemed harmless. I didn’t care about the manuscript, but if it would give Claire some peace, why not? It was just a story.

We gathered my father’s drafts, pages scattered and incomplete, and I took it upon myself to finish what he’d started. At first, it seemed simple enough, filling in gaps, weaving together his cryptic notes. The detective, conspiracies, all the familiar noir tropes my father loved. It felt mechanical like I was merely transcribing his thoughts. After weeks of late nights and revisions, I finally typed the last sentence, printed the manuscript, and set it aside, thinking it was done. A project completed, his legacy fulfilled.

But I was wrong. It was far from over.

The strange things started small. I remember the first time I noticed one of the characters. It was a man in a grey suit, walking down our street, smoking a cigarette. There was nothing remarkable about him, except for the overwhelming sense of familiarity that washed over me when I saw him. I couldn’t place it at first, but then it hit me. He looked exactly like the character my father had described “Detective Harlow,” the chain-smoking, cynical investigator who was always lurking in the background of my father’s work. I laughed it off as a coincidence. After all, my father’s characters were archetypes, not unique creations. But then it happened again.

A woman at the grocery store, standing by the produce section, muttering to herself in an all-too-familiar rhythm. I overheard her saying a line that was pulled straight from my father’s manuscript, word for word. She didn’t even look at me. She just said it, grabbed an apple and walked away. A feeling of unease washed over me, but again, I brushed it off. Maybe I was imagining things.

That night, I woke up to the sound of rustling paper. At first, I thought it was the wind outside, or maybe some animal scurrying near my window. But then I saw him, Detective Harlow. He was standing by my bed, his body a twisted parody of a man. He looked real, but he wasn’t. His skin wasn’t skin at all, but paper-thin, fragile sheets that crinkled and cracked as he moved. His eyes were flat, lifeless like the ink had been smudged too many times, barely recognizable as eyes. And he said nothing. Just stood there, staring at me, like he was waiting for something.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. My heart was a hammer in my chest, and all I could think was, this isn’t real, this can’t be real. But there he was. A character from a book, made of paper, standing at my bedside. I blinked, and he was gone, vanished into the shadows of the room like he’d never been there.

I told Claire the next day. She didn’t believe me, of course. Why would she? 

“It’s just the grief,” she said. “You’re seeing things because of Dad.”

 But it wasn’t grief. I hadn’t even felt grief. It was something else, something darker.

And then it started happening more. Everywhere I went, I saw them, people who weren’t people. They looked like characters from the book, walking around in the real world, acting normal enough but always with something off. Their movements were too stiff, too deliberate like they were being puppeteered by invisible strings. Their faces were too perfect, their words too scripted. And worse, they were multiplying.

At the park, a woman was sitting on a bench, reading a newspaper. I recognized her immediately, she was one of the secondary characters, a minor plot device in the manuscript. I remember staring at her, my mouth dry, and as if sensing my gaze, she slowly turned to look at me. Her eyes were flat and dead, just like Harlow’s, her smile paper-thin. 

They were everywhere. At my office, in the grocery store, lurking at the edge of my vision. And no one else could see them. Claire couldn’t see them.

 “You’re imagining things,” she said. “It’s stress. You need to relax.”

But I wasn’t imagining it. They were real. And they were replacing people. I started to notice the subtle shifts. A co-worker who used to laugh loudly at meetings was suddenly too quiet, her words strained like they were coming from a script. My neighbour, who used to wave to me every morning, now stood at his window, staring out with vacant eyes as if waiting for a cue to move.

I thought I was losing my mind. So I tried to destroy the manuscript. I thought if I burned it, if I wiped it from existence, maybe it would end. Maybe these things would go away, and I could go back to my life. I set the manuscript on fire in the backyard, watching as the pages curled and blackened, the words turning to ash. For the first time in weeks, I felt a sliver of hope.

The next morning, I found the manuscript on my desk. Pristine. Untouched. Every page was exactly as it had been before like I’d never burned it at all. My heart sank. I tried shredding it, drowning it, tearing it apart piece by piece. But every time, it came back, whole and complete, waiting for me.

I’m trapped. I don’t know what to do. The paper people are everywhere now, and I can’t tell who’s real and who’s one of them. They move through the world like shadows, replacing the people I used to know, taking their places, living their lives, but always with that strange wrongness hanging over them, like actors who don’t quite know their lines.

And here’s the worst part: I’m starting to feel it, too. It’s subtle at first, but now I can feel the pull like ink seeping into my veins. Some days, my reflection flickers, my face stretching thin, pale, like paper crumpling. But last night, I saw him, my father, standing in the mirror, his eyes hollow, his skin like crumpled pages.

He smiled a grotesque grin and whispered, “You finished the story. Now, it’s time for you to join it.”

I realized that I wasn’t just being watched. I was being written into his world. Every detail of my life, every moment, was being transcribed into his manuscript. I’m not merely losing myself, I'm being pulled into his story, becoming part of his twisted creation.
