Have you ever heard about the outbreak that took over Key West in the summer of 1980? Well, I am one of the few people that still knows about it, and I'm sick and tired of holding my tongue.

My name is not important, but for the sake of fluidity, I'll go by John.

In the fall of 1979, I, along with a small group of friends, spent a long, drunken weekend planning our trip to Key West for the summer of 1980.

Marco, my best friend, had us out to his house one weekend a month for a two-day bender of Cuban premium cigars, cheap whiskey, and pizza. a tradition that lasted in our little group for almost 10 years. We would play poker, darts and billiards from sun up to sun down. 

There were six of us in our group. We had all gone to high school together and managed to stay friends despite some wildly different post-highschool paths.

Danny was the jock of the group. He played semi-pro football up in Canada for 3 years after we graduated high school. His claim to fame was that he led our high school varsity team to the state championship twice, winning it all in our senior year. He was a monster of a guy, standing 6'6" and weighing over two hundred and fifty pounds.

Jeff was the jack of all trades. He was always working on some redneck engineering project in his parents garage tearing apart small motorcycles and lawn mowers to produce Awe inspiring creations. 

He earned himself quite the suspension our 11th grade year after the school superintendent found his beloved Mercury Grand Marquis in the teachers parking lot with its wheels replaced with small lawn mower tires.

Jeff was a tall and skinny guy, however what he lacked in raw strength he easily made up for in MacGyver like wit. 

Tim and Jim were twin brothers that constantly found themselves knee deep in sibling dispute. They were quick to throw punches at each other when either felt they were being slighted. 

The brothers were high-school slackers and never seized to play the part of class clowns. The tricks the boys pulled on Mrs. Pfeiffer are still talked about to this very day. 

The twins, however did find themselves in a little bit of hot water after we graduated. Tim was at the local bar playing pool with Billy Tompkins lady when Bill and a few of his brothers showed up hotter than hell looking for a brawl, and a brawl is what they got. 

Tim and Jim supposedly went back to back in the small bar throwing hay makers and elbows. Although they fought like crazy they got the worst of the physical damage. Jim found himself with two broken fingers and 3 cracked ribs while Tim earned a broken nose. 

The boys thought they were in the clear when they shook hands with Billy after the fight had finished. Unfortunately the Bar owner decided to press charges for the broken pool table and the tipped over jukebox. 

Tim and Jim spent 4 months locked in Fox County Correctional for destruction of private property. 

My best friend Marco was like the brother I never had. He and I would spend almost every single day of our fleeting youth together. 

Marco came from a middle class family that worked their asses of to send him to a good college. He was always a good student and honestly often times he would let me cheat off of his schoolwork so I could pass the classes I never bothered to study for. 

Marco was lucky to avoid the draft along with my other friends. It certainly helped that the war was winding down. 

Marco's father was a banker, he always wanted his son to do the same. Marco however had no interest at all. When he informed his parents that he was going to forego buisness school for a cross country road trip in a Volkswagen bus with a couple of flower power hippies they were inconsolable. 

Marco had spent his entire childhood being a "goody two-shoes" and needed a change. I recall asking him if he was sure about his choice and he said "listen brother I have spent 17 years being who everyone else wanted me to be, it's time I find out who I really am" 

While I found his sentiment a little far out there for me I understood that he was always cooped up and needed a change of scenery.

Then there's me. I had decided at a young age to follow in the footsteps of my father and his father. I joined the United States Marine Corp. 

I served just under a year in Vietnam before the war came to an end. After the pull out I was restationed in Okinawa, Japan where I lived out some of the best years of my life. 

I still remember the night we all decided to visit Key West. We were huddled around Marcos mahogany dining table slapping cards down on its face and laughing loudly about our memories. 

"You remember the look on old lady Pfeiffer's wrinkled face when that chair collapsed under her ass in the cafeteria" Jim cackled through his words as he spoke them

"Yea even better was when Mr.Handerson ripped his pants trying to pick her fat ass up!" Danny replied nearly choking on his cigar. 

"Those were the times man, they really were" I replied 
 
"So what's the plan for next summer man?" Asked Jim turning to look at Marco.
"Hell if I know....you guys wanna go to Cali again?" He returned in question

"Man I'm sick of the hippie shit. I want somewhere warm with less people, some peace and quiet wouldn't hurt" spat Jeff 

Marco peered at Jeff with a twinge of anger before he responded "Hey man what's so damn bad about peaceful people?" 

"Man that's not what I meant, you know damn well I just don't like crowds and those damn hippies are always making big crowds!" Replied Jeff 

"You just wanna shack up with more flower power girls don't ya marc?" I shot out giving him a soft elbow to the side. 

"Hey man I heard Marco here likes his broads with as much armpit hair as him" shouted Tim through laughter.

Marco threw down his cards and stood from the table before yelling "I'm gonna make you eat those words you little shit!" Before giving chase to an inebriated Tim with a smile on his mug.

The two ended in a ball of friendly combat in the front yard where Tim yelled uncle after Marco placed a long spit covered finger into Tim's ear.

"Fucking gross dude!" Tim yelled while wiping the saliva front his ear with his shirt. 

Bent over catching his breath Marco said "I don't like my girls hairy ya prick" 

Moments of humor like that were all but continuous. I miss those times the most. Times when all the boys were together, pushing each other's buttons and horsing around. I'd give just about anything to have that back today.

We all finally made it back to the table when Danny suggested we go to Key West. 
"Listen guys it might not be Cali,  and it might not be peace and quiet, but my uncle has a house near the southern part of the island he told me we could use" 

Silence crept into the room as we all sat there pondering his suggestion 

"C'mon guys, long beaches, fine girls, ocean front view.... your killing me here!" 

"I mean I'm not opposed to watch the ladies walk the beach all day with a nice drink in my hand, I don't know about you sissy's though?" Tim muttered. 

"I'm in!" Shouted Jeff while downing the rest of his drink. 

"Shit sounds like we got our spot" I said aloud.

Marco took a puff off his Cuban before extinguishing it in his cup. "Sounds like we are Florida bound boys"
