I didn’t respond. Couldn’t.

Every muscle screamed—RUN—but I just stood there, frozen. Like an idiot wax figure in a haunted diorama.

Because he was here.

The Night Manager.

He didn’t just look at me. He peeled me apart with his eyes—slow, meticulous, clinical. Like a frog in a high school lab he couldn’t wait to slice open. I didn’t move. Not out of courage. Just the kind of primal instinct that tells you not to twitch while something ancient and awful decides if you’re prey or plaything.

He tilted his head—not like a person, but like a crow picking over roadkill.

“Phase Two,” he said, “is not a punishment.” Great.

“Though if you prefer punishment,” he added, “that can be arranged.”

His voice was polished, sure—but empty. Like someone programmed a seduction algorithm and forgot to add a soul. “It’s an adjustment,” he continued. “A clarification of expectations. An opportunity.”

That last word made the old man flinch. And honestly? Good. Nice to know I wasn’t the only one whose stomach turned at the sound of him talking like a recruiter for a cult.

The Night Manager turned toward him, slow, and smiled wider.

“You remain curious.” He said it like it was a defect that needed fixing. The old man stayed silent. Maybe he wasn’t even supposed to be here—but right now, I was glad he was. Anything was better than being left alone with this thing.

Then those unnatural eyes locked on me. His grin aimed for human and missed by miles. “You’re adapting. Not thriving, of course—but surviving.”

Well, thank you for noticing, eldritch boss man. I do try.

Then—he moved. Or didn’t. I don’t know. There was just less space. “I evaluate personnel personally when they make it this far,” he said. “Five more nights, and then we begin your final review.” A performance review. Wonderful.

His grin stretched just a bit too far. Perfect teeth. The kind of smile you'd see in an ad for dental work… or on a predator pretending to be human.

“Most don’t make it this far,” he said, voice light now, like this was some casual lunch meeting. “Still, you’re not quite what I expected. But then again, you’re human—blinking, sleeping, feeling. Inefficient. But adorable.”

I spoke before I could stop myself. “You call us inefficient, but you spend a lot of time pretending to be one of us. For someone above it all, you seem… invested.”

Something flickered behind his eyes—not anger. Amusement. “Oh,” he purred. “A sense of humor. Careful. That tends to draw attention.”

He smiled again.

“Especially mine.”

Ew.

He stepped closer. “If you’re very good, and very quiet, and just a little clever…” His voice dripped syrup. “You might earn something special.” His grin stretched wider, skin bending wrong. “Something permanent.” From his jacket, he placed a black card on the shelf as if it might bite.

**Night Supervisor Candidate – Pending Review**

My heart stuttered.

“I’m not interested,” I said. My voice shook, pathetic but honest.

He leaned close enough to make the air taste rotten. “I didn’t ask what you’re interested in,” he murmured. “I asked if you’d survive.” Then he straightened, smoothed his immaculate lapel, and rushed toward the door like he was late for something.

At the door, he paused, one hand resting lightly against the glass as if savoring the moment. He looked back over his shoulder, eyes gleaming. “Oh, and Remi?”

My name sounded poisoned in his mouth.

“Try not to die before Tuesday,” the Night Manager said, smooth as ice. “I’d hate to lose someone… promising.”

He winked, then slipped out. The doors hissed closed behind him. The air didn’t relax—it thickened, heavy as a held breath, and for a long moment it felt like even the walls were listening.

I collapsed to my knees, legs drained of strength. My heart was pounding, but everything else inside me felt frozen. Somewhere between panic and paralysis. The old man had vanished too. No footsteps. No goodbye. One second he was there, the next… gone. Like there was a trapdoor in the floor only he knew about.

The store stayed quiet as if none of this had happened. I waited. One minute. Then two. Still nothing. Only then did I remember how to breathe. The Night Manager’s card still sat on the shelf. Heavy. Like it was waiting to be acknowledged.

I didn’t touch it.

Not out of caution, but because I didn’t trust it not to touch me back. I used a toothbrush and shoved it behind a row of cereal boxes, like it was a live roach, and headed toward the breakroom. I needed caffeine. 

In the breakroom, I poured the last inch of lukewarm coffee into a cracked mug and sat down just long enough to read the rules again. Memorize them. It was the only thing that made me feel remotely prepared. Eventually, I got up and forced myself to keep working. Restocking shelves felt normal. Familiar. Safe.

Until it wasn’t.

It was 4:13 a.m. I remember that because I had just finished putting away the last can of beans when I heard it. Tap. Tap. Tap.

On the cooler door behind me.

I turned automatically.

And froze.

My reflection was standing there. It was me—but not me. Something was off. Too still. Too sharp. Then it tilted its head. I mirrored the movement, instinctively. It smiled. And that’s when my stomach dropped. The first rule slammed into my mind like a trap snapping shut:

“**The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**”

So I didn’t look away.

I locked eyes with the thing wearing my face. It tilted its head again. Wider smile. Too wide. My skin crawled. My breath caught. I was stuck—and the rule didn’t say how to get out of this. I had one idea. Use the rules against each other.

I slipped my phone out, eyes locked on its gaze, and in a voice barely more than a whisper, I said: “Hey Siri, play baby crying sounds.”

Shrill wails filled the aisle. Instant. Echoing.

And I saw it—the reflection flinched.

Then I heard footsteps from Aisle 3.

Heavy ones.

I had used the second rule: “**If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**”

The reflection’s grin cracked, its jaw spasming like it was holding back a scream. Then it snapped, bolting sideways—jagged, frantic—and melted into the next freezer door like smoke sucked into a vent.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Sprinting for the loading dock, every step a drumbeat in my skull. But before I could slam the door shut, I glanced back.

Ten feet away, barreling straight for me, was a nightmare stitched out of panic and fever: a heaving knot of arms—hundreds of them—clawing at the tiles to drag itself forward. Too many fingers. Hands sprouting from hands, folding over each other like a wave of flesh. Faces pressed and stretched between the limbs like trapped things trying to scream but never getting air. It rolled, slithered and sprinted straight at me, faster than anything that size should move.

I slammed the door, locked it, killed the crying sound, and fumbled for my phone to set the timer. Eleven minutes. Exactly, like the rule said.

I sat on the cold concrete, shaking so hard my teeth hurt, lungs dragging in air that didn’t seem to reach my chest.

Three booming bangs shook the door, wet and heavy, like palms the size of frying pans slapping against metal.

Then—silence.

I stared at the timer. The seconds crawled. When the eleven minutes were up, I opened the door. And the store looked exactly the same. Shelves neat. Lights buzzing. Aisles quiet. Like none of it had ever happened.

But it had.

And I’d figured something out. This place didn’t just follow rules. It played by them. Which meant if I stayed smart—if I stayed sharp—I could play back. And maybe that’s how I’d survive.

The old man came again at 6 a.m. with the same indifference as always, like this wasn’t a nightmarish hellstore and we weren’t all inches from being ripped inside-out by the rules.

He carried a battered clipboard, sipped burnt coffee like it still tasted like something, and gave me a once-over that landed somewhere between clinical and pitying.

“You’re still here,” he said, like that was surprising.

I didn’t have the energy to be sarcastic. “Unfortunately.”

He nodded like I’d just reported the weather. “Did you take the card?” he asked.

I shook my head. “It didn't seem like a normal card”

The old man didn’t nod. He didn’t do much of anything, really—just stood there, looking at me the way someone looks at a cracked teacup. Not ruined. Not useful. Just existing without reason.

“You made it through the reflection,” he said finally. “That’s something.”

I leaned against the breakroom doorframe, hands still trembling, trying to pretend they weren’t. “Barely. Had to bait one rule with another. It felt like solving a haunted crossword puzzle with my life on the line.”

That, finally, earned the faintest twitch of a grin.

“Smart,” he said. “Risky. But smart.”

I waited. When he didn’t say anything else, I asked, “Why did he show up?” 

“He showed up because you’re still standing.” the old man said, his voice going flat.

I didn’t respond right away. That thought—that just surviving was enough to get his attention—made something cold slither under my skin. The Night Manager didn’t seem like the kind of guy who handed out gold stars. No. He tracked potential. Watched like a spider deciding which fly was smart enough to be worth webbing up slowly.

“Why me?” I finally asked.

The old man was already walking away, clipboard tucked under one arm. “You should ask yourself something better,” he said. “Why now?”

I followed him.

Down past the cereal aisle, past the cooler doors (which I now avoided like they were leaking poison), past the place where the mangled mess of hands chased me. That question stuck with me. Why now?

“Did you ever take the card?” I asked suddenly. “Did he ever offer it to you?”

The old man’s footsteps slowed. Just slightly. Barely enough to notice. But I did.

He didn’t turn.

“I said no,” he replied after a beat.

“And?”

“I’m still here, aren’t I?”

Not exactly comforting.

We walked in silence for a while, the hum of the fluorescents buzzing overhead like mosquitoes in a motel room. The store didn’t feel real anymore. It hadn’t for a while. It felt like a set, a stage. Like we were performing normalcy just well enough to keep something worse from stepping onstage.

“He said Phase Two was a clarification of expectations,” I said. “What does that actually mean?”

He gave me a look I didn’t like. Like he wasn’t sure if I was ready for the answer—or if saying it aloud would invite something to come confirm it.

Then he said, “It means you’re on your own now.”

I stopped walking.

“What?”

He turned to face me fully for the first time since we started this walk. “Up until now, the rules were enough. You followed them, or you didn’t. Cause, effect. But Phase Two means you’ve graduated from ‘basic survival’ to something else. Now things notice you.”

A beat. “And the rules?”

“They still matter,” he said. “But now they twist. Shift. Sometimes they bait you.”

I stared at him. “They bait you?”

He nodded. “And sometimes the only way out is by using one against another.”

I exhaled slowly. “So there’s no safety net.”

“No,” he said, almost gently. “But if it makes you feel better… there never was.”

I felt the walls press in again.

This wasn’t a job anymore. It never had been.

It was a trial. An experiment. A maze, maybe. With rules that sometimes saved you, and sometimes led you straight into the Minotaur’s mouth. And the Night Manager?

He was just the one watching which rats figured out the shortcuts—and which ones continued to stay in the maze.

That night, I slept like a log.

Not because I was calm—hell no. It was more like my brain knew I wouldn’t survive if I showed up to work even half-asleep. Like some primal part of me finally understood the stakes.

When I dragged myself in for the next shift, the old man was already there—just like always. Same bitter coffee, same battered clipboard. But this time, something about him was different. Not tired. Not grim.

Determined.

“It’s three more nights until your evaluation,” he said, like it mattered to both of us. I nodded slowly. “Should I be dreading the three nights… or the evaluation itself?” He didn’t answer right away.

Instead, I asked, “What happens after Phase Two?”

He froze. Just for a second. But enough.

Then he said it—quietly, like it was a confession, not a fact. “Oh. I never made it past Phase Two.” I blinked. “Wait… but you’re still here.”

He smiled. Not warmly. Not bitterly. Just… thin. Mechanical.

“Yes,” he said. “I am.”

Something in my gut twisted.

Because I know what happened to people who broke the rules. Who failed. They were erased. Gone like they’d never been here at all.

But him? He stayed. And that’s when I realized all the little things I’d been filing under “weird but whatever.”

The way the lines in his face deepened every day, like time was carving at him but never finishing the job. How he only ever sipped at that lukewarm sludge he called coffee, never swallowing enough to matter. How his footsteps made no sound. How the motion sensors never blinked when he walked by. How the store itself acted like he wasn’t even there.

“How long have you been here?” I asked, quieter than I meant to.

His eyes didn’t quite meet mine. “Long enough.”

The silence stretched.

“You okay?” I asked.

“I’m always okay,” he replied instantly.

Too instantly.

That was when I knew.

He looked like a man. Talked like one.

But whatever he was now…

Whatever Phase Two had done to him…

He wasn’t exactly human anymore.
