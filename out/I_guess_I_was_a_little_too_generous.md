When you see a homeless person holding a sign on the street corner begging for food or money, homeless veteran and whatnot, what do you think? Scam? Legit? Where do they sleep at night?

Are you a sympathetic person? I want to believe that's enough for anybody, like it was for me. Not that I know for sure where I'm going. I just know it's kind.

I'm in just my mid twenties, but through dedication and sheer whatever, I landed the prestigious position of pawn shop manager at the edge of town. Maybe you've heard of it. Darnell's  Electroknickknacks. Yeah. Well, Darnell, the owner, is a dad, so at least we know where his sense of humor comes from.

I'm just boring old Donald, yeah our store's name is weird, I can give you thirty for this flat screen TV.

I got calls at that job from time to time, but not often. Just someone asking me for a ballpark figure on a price for something they wanted to sell. Most of the time it's sorry, gotta bring it in or else we can't give a number. Why are you cursing at me. Get off the damn phone.

Sorry, I probably sound soulless and bored. I'm actually the opposite. I'm in shock. Good? Bad? You decide.

I got a call on Friday, but it wasn't the usual. The voice on the other end was a woman's voice, very gentle and smooth as though she were a topnotch therapist trying to reassure me that I would be able to get through some horrible trauma. The phone didn't have her number on it.

"Hello," she said immediately when I picked up, before I could say it first. "Donald Carlson?"

"That's me. Are we getting popular?" I was a bit surprised at the thought. I was content working here, it helped with my naturally laid back lifestyle, but we were kind of on the dead end side of things. Quiet in the store half the time.

"I didn't call about your store, Donny. I wanted to ask you something very important."

I frowned into the phone. "Is this about taxes or something? I'm only the store manager. I don't own it."

"Donny, please, try to focus. Not your store. This is about you. It's very important."

I was beginning to feel nervous. "What's going on? Who are you?"

"My name is Emelie. Donny, I need to ask for something from you. A donation, if you're willing."

Oh. It was THAT kind of call. But how had Emelie known my name? If she'd guessed Darnell, that would be no surprise, but I just worked here. How had she known I would be the one to answer the phone?

"Really," I muttered. Why not at least see what she meant? "What do you have in mind?" _A hundred bucks I'm not willing to shovel away,_ I thought. I'm not selfish, but I'm not giving anything to some weirdo caller like this, and definitely not anything substantial.

"Would you be willing to give just one dollar to someone who needs it more, Donny?"

I furrowed my brow. "You want my card number for a dollar? Get real."

"I don't need your information. Just a yes or a no, and that's all." She sounded painstakingly patient, and I had to admit, that was pretty dedicated. Most scammers would give up at overdone sarcasm, or at least be cussing me out by now.

"Oh. Uh, I don't know how that works, but sure. Fine by me." I was smirking. How in the world would she get it without any of my account info?

"Yes, Donny? Is that your answer?"

"Yes." I rolled my eyes, but kept the impatience out of my voice.

"Thank you," she whispered. "Thank you so much." And she hung up.

For about five seconds I tried not to burst out laughing in the middle of the store. What the hell had that been?

And suddenly a cold pit filled my stomach. The YES. There was a scam out there for collecting voice clips, wasn't there? And the word "yes" in someone's voice could be used to make a purchase in their name? I didn't have any apps or accounts that operated off of me doing that, and the whole rumor could have just been fearmongering and stupidity, but suddenly I felt like I didn't want to take a chance.

I logged into my bank account at once, looking for the support number to see if I could ask them about the possibility of the scam, and change my cards if need be.

There was a small message just below the big display of the few hundred bucks in my checking account.

_Thank you Donny._

I clicked on my checking account, feeling a sharp zing in my chest, that mini heart attack feeling that something real bad's about to happen.

The latest transaction...it was one dollar.

No description. No destination.

Just one dollar taken. By someone or something invisible.

Who the hell...suddenly I heard a tapping on the window next to the counter. I turned in confusion, and saw a young girl standing outside. She was a little scuffed up, as though she'd been outside for a long time. Messy dark hair. Faint smears of dirt on her face. Clothes stained, some edges frayed. Face a little gaunt, not alarmingly so as though she were truly starving, but she definitely looked a bit malnourished.

She had both hands behind her back, smiling up at me, her face the very picture of admiration, as though she'd found a long lost friend, or a guardian angel. I blinked and stared at her, then slowly raised my hand in an awkward, short wave.

In response, she reached into her pocket, keeping the other hand still behind her back, and pulled out a white rectangle of paper. A receipt. I leaned forward to read it.

_Hubert's Hot Dogs! Get 'em while they're hot!_

_Jumbo Frankie Meal Deal! One dollar for the Big Bread Frankie with chili and cheese and a bottle of ice water! One lucky day a month only!_

She reached out with her other hidden hand.

A white shopping bag. She reached in and pulled out a large, long aluminum foil wrapped hot dog. A jumbo sized bottle of water with ice cubes in it came out next.

She was staring at me with her hot dog and water, smiling so big she could have been on a Christmas card. Tears flowing down her cheeks.

_Thank you._ Her lips formed the words. Staring at me as though I were her hero.

Then she turned and ran off.

I'll admit, I was shocked. I logged back into my account and looked at the transaction again.

It was no longer blank. Now the destination was _HuDog+MainTrans+Carolina,_ and the description was _Hubert's Jumbo Frankie Meal Deal._

As though the money had gone through right away, but to whom, had been decided only after it had already been paid.

I logged out, stunned. I looked at the window again, and there was nothing. She was, I figured, probably gone forever, and I'd never see her again. She couldn't have been the voice on the phone, though. That had been a grown woman. Maybe my age, maybe ten years older, no idea from just a voice. But that tiny kid? No way it had been her.

But my heart was kind of glowing, though. You ever get that feeling, when you do something wonderful and can actually see the gratitude from someone? The way you keep that with you for a while? Not an egotistical _I'm a freakin' saint_ kind of feeling, but more of an _oh damn, I actually made a homeless child's day_ kind of feeling.

And then it hit me. _A homeless child._ Shit, I couldn't just let her run off like that! Couldn't I call someone? Maybe take her to the police? Could they help find her a home? Or did she already have parents and a home and only looked bad because things weren't so good for her? The more I thought about it, the more mixed up I became. I'd never been in a situation like this.

So I told Ernie, one of my floor employees. He was a few years younger than me, paying for college, but wise beyond his years. He seemed as baffled as I was, and I guess I'm just grateful he believed the story.

"Nothing you can do, dude. The cops might go searching for a kid like what you describe, maybe they'll find her, maybe they won't. But the system, it fails kids more often than we want to acknowledge. Besides, if that chick knew this was going to happen, then that kid probably already has her watching over her. Maybe it was her mom or something. I dunno. Maybe this was just some cheapo feel-good scam."

I hadn't considered that. The little girl probably already had a guardian. That woman on the phone could have been her mom, or her older sister, and besides, she _had_ known my money was going to the kid, hadn't she?

Was leaving it there the right choice? I don't know. I'm not filled with worldly knowledge or a KFC-sized bucketful of common sense about every possible difficult situation I could find myself in. But that was what I did. If anything, if she had really needed my help, she wouldn't have run off with such joy on her face, would she?

For a week, nothing else happened. And then, Friday again, right after I came back from lunch, the phone rang.

I opened my mouth to greet the customer, and got the instant "Hello? Donald Carlson?"

My stomach sort of squeezed in on itself. Her again. Was this a good thing? Was I going to help another child get a meal somehow? Everything happening around me was perfectly mundane, almost completely ordinary, but I was filled with the sense of something wonderful, almost supernatural.

"It's me." My voice sounded dry and hoarse.

"Donny, it's me again. Emelie. Everything worked out well before, and I was wondering if we could do this again. Would you be willing to make a donation?"

I paused for a moment. "Sure, a bit more this time?"

She seemed to hesitate. I could almost hear her holding her breath; the other side of the line had suddenly gone quiet.

"One minute," she said softly.

"Oh. Uh yeah, no problem," I stammered. "I'll be here."

"No, Donny, I mean...one minute. Can you donate that?"

"Wh...what? I don't know what you mean." My heart raced.

"I'm sorry. I can't explain. Can you trust me, Donny? Are you willing to give one minute?"

The little girl's face flashed into my mind. She hadn't gone to sleep with a hurting tummy that night because I had given one dollar. Whatever her situation, however good or bad things were for her, I'd at least put a little light into her day and made that night a bit easier.

So what miracle could a single minute pull off? Could I help someone even more?

"Yes. I'll donate a minute." I felt stupid saying that, having no clue what it meant. But I knew it meant something important.

Suddenly, I went stiff, and the phone slipped out of my hand, clattering onto the table. Hardy land lines, it didn't even crack, and luckily, neither did my head.

I opened my eyes, panting and sweating, to see my three floor associates gathered around me behind the counter.

"I said call 911!" Ernie was insisting, and then he leaped a foot in the air as I shot up into a sitting position.

"Ey yo!" Tyrone said. "The hell you nappin' down there for, man?" He was smiling, sort of, but his eyes looked terrified, as though I'd just dodged a bullet.

"You just fell right to the ground out of nowhere, Donny," Leslie chimed in. "Just a second ago."

I tried to speak, but they were all over me, helping me into a chair, handing me a glass of water. It pays to not be a shit manager, I guess. Your people care about you. Leslie was still debating about calling an ambulance for me, but I thanked them all and insisted I'd be fine.

We went back to business as usual after everyone was assured I wouldn't pass out again (call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure I'd been out exactly sixty seconds and was in no danger of it happening again). There was nobody at the window.

But two hours later, there was someone at the door.

A policewoman came in, dark blue suit, coffee colored skin, black ponytail, thirty at most. She looked almost as though she were in a trance, seeing something ethereal. She barely glanced around before seeing me, and gravitating right toward my counter.

"Donald Carlson?" she whispered, and a flash of deja vu hit me. But she had a different voice; she wasn't the woman from the phone.

I nodded, and felt the color drain out of my face. Was it something bad this time? What had happened? Was the whole thing a gamble, and I'd landed on Bankrupt this time? Who had gotten hurt because of this little game I'd decided to play?

But her lips were trembling, and she was beaming at me, looking as though she were trying not to cry. She reached out to me, and I clumsily offered her my hand. She took it with the gentleness of a mother comforting her child, and led me out of the store. Jesus Christ, was I under arrest? What could I have done by giving up a minute of my time?

There was an unmarked bus waiting outside by a couple of police cars. Three more officers stood by, along with a small group of maybe twenty people. Young women, from children about the age of the girl from yesterday, up to college aged, all stood outside the bus. Some looked nervous. Some looked relieved enough to have been reborn.

"What's going on?" I asked stupidly.

"Mr. Carlson," the officer next to me said, her voice shaking, "we traced the call back to the phone at your counter in this pawn shop. A call lasting exactly one minute. A man with your voice, identifying himself with your full name, gave to our police force not a few hours ago, the address of a human trafficking house you claimed you had been anonymously informed of by an unknown caller with no callback number."

My eyes were as wide as dinner plates by then. Of course I'd done no such thing; didn't she know that from the way the news was hitting me? But...then suddenly, I realized.

WHAT had I been doing in that one minute that I'd been out? Had I fallen right away? Had I...first dialed someone?

What had Leslie said? _Just a second ago._ They'd gotten to me in a second. A full minute had not passed from the moment I'd fallen and woken up. Only a few seconds.

I had dialed the police first, and then passed out, and woken back up instantly.

I tried to speak. Tears were clogging my throat. Several of the young women and a few of the children were right in front of me now, holding me, crying, and I felt like I was going to fall apart. Like a Jenga puzzle you've removed too many blocks from.

I couldn't have done something this meaningful. Not me. I just _couldn't_ have. I mean, I've always wanted to be able to help someone in a profound, meaningful way, I dunno why. Because I'm nice? Because I'm some feel-good sap?

I'll spare you the rest of the waterworks. I didn't hold together too well after a few seconds of being hugged and hearing them cry at their rescue. I sank to my knees and kind of became a mess. The officers turned away, their faces twisted a bit painfully, and I had never felt anything so beautiful as this moment of wonder, that just giving one minute had done something so good. I didn't feel like I _deserved_ to feel this kind of...whatever it was.

Pride? No. I didn't feel satisfied, I didn't feel proud, I didn't feel like it was all a job well done. I felt something that made my chest so warm, made me so weak that I could barely stand back up.

Over the next week or so, I got calls from dozens of parents, older siblings, relatives, people sending me flowers, presents, cards, visiting me in person. An old lady actually showed up to kneel as soon as I opened the door, and bless my soul in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, for the rescue of her granddaughter, amen.

I just couldn't possibly deserve any of this. I already had enough trouble just taking a compliment. I wasn't really some kind of hero just because...because I'd given one minute to a telephone stranger and then been possessed...right?

Well, next Friday.

The phone rang. It was evening, almost time for closing, and I'd actually felt a bit hollow that day, as there had been no call. I felt like that had become a side job, almost. Some kind of miracle puppet, for the mysterious stranger to pull my strings and make me do wonderful things only she knew could happen. Together we were making a difference. Somehow. Don't ask, I'm still baffled. But if I was some kind of benign meat puppet with a kind master who worked with me to save innocent lives so easily, was I going to ever say no to her calls? You know the answer.

"Donny." She spoke the moment I picked up the phone. She sounded different.

She sounded so sad.

"Hey...Emelie?" I asked. "Are you all right?"

She was quiet for a moment.

"It went...pretty well last time," I admitted, blushing. I didn't want to really acknowledge the weight of it all, and besides, didn't she deserve more credit than me? She must have been the one making things happen. At least I thought she was.

"I'm sorry, Donny," she whispered. "Oh God, I'm so, so sorry."

My heart sank. NOW it had to be something bad, I just knew it. Was there going to be an occasional mishap? A price to pay for such easily done good deeds?

"Em...Emelie?"

"Would you like...to make a donation?" she asked, with great difficulty. It sounded like each word weighed a ton on her heart.

"Of----of course. What kind?" I blurted before I could lose my nerve.

"Could y..." she paused, and I could hear her voice momentarily flatten as she quieted down. That small, heart-wrenching sound of someone cutting their voice off to stifle a sob.

She was crying.

"Would...you..." I heard her moan softly in a quivering voice, and she sniffed a few times, trying to gather a little composure.

"Would you...be willing...to...give....yourself?" she was trying so hard to hold on. I waited for her to finish, but then I realized her sentence was already done.

"Me?" I didn't get it.

Then I did.

She was breathing so shakily, waiting for that moment when I would say something that destroyed her, either for this reason, or that other one.

But I knew what this must mean. I knew what was at stake. If it wasn't for me, it would be for someone else.

For a moment, I was filled with terror. In fact, I still am. I haven't stopped being scared. Was it worth it? How would it happen? What was in store for me exactly? When, down to the second?

Everything seemed to get darker. Color faded from my vision for a few seconds as I considered the weight of the horrifying choice. A choice I'm still afraid of, even now as I wait for the inevitable. It had to come down to this. This ultimate test. To see if I really could be willing to do that much.

I'm not sure why I gave the answer I did.

"Yes. I accept."

Emelie burst into tears. I heard her long, drawn out, shaking sobs as she struggled to speak. But she only managed one last word.

_"D-Donny."_

Then the sound ended as she hung up.

Nothing was happening. But I knew something would.

Saturday, we were only open in the morning. Closed at twelve. No phone call, of course.

But there was a young woman standing across the street, visible from the window. She was wearing a pale blue dress, an elegant, wonderful thing that at the same time looked so comfortable, even from a distance, she might wear it to bed. Shoulder length wavy black hair. A lovely, kind face.

She was staring at me. Her face gleamed in the sun, and even from far away I could tell she was crying. Ernie asked me at one point what I was looking at, and glanced out there in confusion.

Only I could see her. Emelie would appear for nobody but me.

She was gone by noon, when we closed.

Monday, I was back. So was she. Now on our side of the street, standing on the sidewalk a little ways from the building. No longer crying. But still looking miserable as she stared at me. Now closer, she couldn't even meet my eyes. But she stayed there the whole day.

I was a little more scared then. I had made the choice. I couldn't take it back. But I was more scared than I'd ever been in my life.

Tuesday. She was further down the sidewalk a bit. Closer to the window than before. She managed to look me in the eyes a few times, and every time, I could see the apology there. The back of her dress, I noticed, seemed to be moving, as if something was hiding in there.

I almost hadn't come in to work. I'd wanted to stay huddling in my bed, hoping it would all go away, but I had managed to force myself. I had chosen this. I had to see it through. I had to have the resolve to do what needed to be done.

Wednesday. She was on the grass now, halfway to the window. Watching me. She managed a small smile at one point, and later, a shy wave, though tears still ran down her cheeks. Her dress was fluttering and moving, though there was no breeze.

I was shaking a little on and off that day. Leslie asked me if I was all right. She said I looked pale and sick. I tried to wave off her concerns.

Thursday. She was right outside the window, palms pressed against the glass, looking longingly at me all day. I took out my phone, knowing what was coming for me. I should have done it earlier, I guess, but better late than never. I started this post, and typed out most of it, saving it as a draft. It was the only thing that kept me from leaving early. Just reminding myself what I was doing.

Friday.

The doors unlocked at 7:30 in the morning. The open sign turned on automatically. The doors opened.

My heart stopped as I saw her face. It was too late to run. Too late to change my mind. It had been since the moment I'd said yes. Did I regret it? Did I want to beg her to let me take it back?

Even still, even then, somehow the answer was no. Maybe I'm just half softie, half coward, but I couldn't do it. What that would have done to someone, if I could have changed it...I didn't have that in me.

She walked in slowly, her eyes on me, and came up to the counter. I was the only one there. Nobody else came in till eight. She came closer and closer, and I felt like I would pass out, as though she were projecting the fear from her very being, fear mixed with darkness, that feeling of the unknown approaching, the very word I've been too afraid to acknowledge this whole time, just because I can't bring myself to actually write down that I've willingly brought that particular fate to myself.

She stood on the other side of the counter, staring into my eyes, into my soul. Then she reached forward and took my hands in hers. Tears filled her eyes.

As we stared at each other, it felt as though a lifetime of conversation passed between us in the span of lovely silence. There was nothing but the ticking of the clock on the wall behind me, and the beating of my heart. Her dress fluttered a little, and I thought I saw something white peek out from the side.

Finally, it was almost eight. She closed her eyes, turned, and walked to the door. She paused and looked back at me. We both understood.

As soon as I clocked out for the day...that was it.

She left, and I made more phone calls than I'd ever made in one day. Calls to family. Old friends, new friends, anyone on my contact list. My parents.

I couldn't really explain. But saying goodbye, even veiling it as something they would understand soon, was the hardest thing I've ever done. Even in that one moment before I'd told Emelie yes, I had realized this would be difficult for me, had known it would come, would be necessary. Somehow, I'd put it off. Somehow, she had known I would need to anyway.

Would she have taken me away instantly otherwise, as soon as she'd come in?

Maybe.

Or maybe she'd have given me this last day still anyway, standing outside the window after the short visit. The dress now fluttering in the breeze around her wings, large white feathery wings about as long as she was tall. Flapping slowly, silently, as she watched me, and waited for the clock to wind down. Still occasionally letting a tear escape.

Why?

I wasn't depressed or anything. I wasn't dissatisfied with what I had. I was content, comfortable for the time being, unsure of what the future would bring. But I'd never done anything really, _really_ good, or important, and never made a huge name for myself. What harm could it do? People would miss me, and I was sad to hurt them that way, but they would move on eventually. The world would.

I'm not necessary. Not that mundane way. But in this way, at least I can know I did something right, no matter what it took.

Don't be selfish. Don't be cruel. If Emelie or one of the other sisters finds you, calls you, visits you, you'll know it's one of them when you see her. You'll know she came to you because you're that kind of person who would give.

It doesn't have to always be yes. You aren't a bad person for saying no.

But just pause for a moment and think. Why did they come to you? It isn't a personal attack. It isn't a mind game.

They just know you're the kind of person who can make a difference.

Just give what you can. It doesn't have to be everything. Please don't think you absolutely have to. Maybe I shouldn't have. I'm still afraid of the unknown, even though it's minutes away now. When there's no turning back, no matter how kind she is, no matter how she cries for you, she will make sure you keep your word.

Give what you're willing to, and don't feel obligated to give more. Just do what's right, if you can. You have no idea how much it means until after the fact.

The TV. What's it saying?

We interrupt this broadcast to bring you news of a miracle. Every single person at St. Sharif's Hospital who was dying in the terminal illness ward has suddenly, miraculously recovered. They're claiming they all see angels and that they've all been cured, and are being told they'll live long, happy lives, and all because of one...because of...one person...one...

I don't need to see any more.

When did the day go?

I forgot. We're off today. It's a holiday. Nobody came in at all. The hours flew by. I spent the day making calls, clocked in uselessly on a machine that wasn't connected to the internet, wasn't recording my hours today because it was all turned off. Nobody came in to switch things on out there on the floor. I was so preoccupied, I forgot...I didn't even have to come in.

But yes. I did have to.

Her face in the door now. The door's open. She's coming. Tears in her eyes again, but a small smile on her face.

She's walking slowly toward me, raising a hand. I know it's time. I agreed, after all.

Where am I going? What's coming next? I don't know. The fear's still there. I'm cold, I'm sweating, I'm barely standing. But somehow I know I can do this. I know I can honor my word.

I guess I'll see what's beyond.
