Saira wasn’t average. But she didn’t know it yet. Schizophrenia had clouded much of her mind, masking the brilliance buried deep within her—a brilliance no one had yet fully recognized, least of all herself.


She worked in Dr. Zheng’s cancer research lab, surrounded by microscopes, gene sequences, and endless data. Next door, Dr. Prince studied immortality, a quest that fascinated and distracted her in equal measure.


Biology was her anchor. The clean, elegant spiral of DNA was far simpler to understand than the chaos of people and thoughts. It was this anchor she’d carried from the lecture halls where professors whispered about her rare insight, from Arjun Davaluri—the mathematician who teased her about trying to “decode the universe one molecule at a time”—all the way to this lab where every sacrifice had been worth the hope of a breakthrough.


Dr. Prince appeared at her bench one afternoon, his expression calm but urgent.


“We’re still in the mouse study phase with the immortality project,” he said, almost casually. “The IRB just approved our new protocol.”


Saira nodded but pressed, “What hurdles do you expect moving this to humans?”


“Stem cells,” he replied without hesitation. “Humans don’t have enough. When normal cells try to revert to stem cells, they usually spiral into chaos—cancer. Immortality for humans, right now, means you risk cancer.”


“So you’re searching for a workaround?” she asked.


Leaning back, he allowed a faint smile. “Actually, we’ve figured out how to convert normal cells into stem cells.”

“That’s incredible”, she said excitedly. “Have you published yet?” she breathed.

“No not until we finish the next part.” said Dr. Prince.

“What’s the next part?” said Saira

“Cure cancer,” he said simply.

Saira laughed. “Wouldn’t that be nice?”

“Not to belittle what you’re doing here of course” said Dr. Prince, smiling slightly. “Would you like to jump into this project? I already spoke to Dr. Zheng.”


“Oh. My. God. YES!!” said Saira, barely able to contain herself. She was stuck waiting on reagents for her current project anyway.

“Alright, someone from administration will drop in to get you up to speed on a few things before we start. You’re going to need top secret clearance.”


….

Days passed in a blur of top-secret briefings and guarded conversations. Saira’s mind, once fragmented by shadows and whispers, was now drawn into something far more tangible, yet infinitely more dangerous—a discovery no one had dared to speak aloud.


In a sterile conference room illuminated by the cold glare of fluorescent lights, Dr. Prince unfolded the truth.


“There’s a secret within the genome,” he began, voice low. “A code hidden not in a single gene but in a complex and delicate interplay of genetic and epigenetic markers. This code identifies the rarest kind of genius—individuals whose minds work on a fundamentally different level.”


Saira listened, heart pounding. “And you’ve found this code?”


“We have isolated a series of markers that correlate strongly with heightened cognitive ability—genetic variants linked to intelligence, creativity, problem-solving. Only a small fraction of people have this pattern.”


Her breath caught. “The secret to genius… is in the DNA?”


Dr. Prince nodded. “But it’s not just finding it. It’s dangerous. Those who carry the code often wrestle with mental health disorders, mood swings, even psychosis—because these genes walk a fine line between brilliance and fragility.”


Saira’s mind raced, the familiar haze of her schizophrenia lifting slightly, replaced by clarity.
“Does… this mean me?” Her voice barely a whisper.
“We ran your genome through the analysis multiple times,” Dr. Prince said carefully. “Your genetic and epigenetic profile matches the pattern. You’re not average, Saira. You’re one of the genius few.”


A flood of emotions crashed over her—fear, disbelief, a fragile hope.
“But the schizophrenia?” she asked. “How can the mind bear both?”


“That’s the risk,” Dr. Prince admitted. “Brilliance and madness have always danced dangerously close. Your mind is a battleground for both.”


Saira sat back, the weight of decades of doubt pressing down. She was brilliant. She was broken. Yet, for the first time, she understood it wasn’t weakness—it was who she was.


And now, with this secret, everything was about to change.
