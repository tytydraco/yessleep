Children ask a lot of questions, but they’re never the right ones. For example, when I was a kid I never asked my parents why we had to live in the middle of the woods. I never asked why our neighbors lived so far away, or why none of them had children. And I never asked why we had to turn off all the lights before sundown. 

I never suspected something was off because my parents were smart about it. They treated the lights rule like it was normal, so I did too. They even made a game out of it. Every sundown the three of us would race around the house, scrambling to see who could turn off the most light switches. What could’ve been a traumatic memory was transformed into whimsical fun.

But you can only cheat the inevitable so many times. One night, Dad was working late, Mom lost track of time for some reason, and I was distracted by my Bionicles. The setting sun didn’t cross my mind until Dad burst through the front door in a panic. I looked up, startled by the sudden entrance, and saw the sky behind him was pitch dark.

“Honey, turn off the lights!” Dad barked as he dashed to the nearest light switch.

My parents scrambled through the house in a panic, but I stayed calm. Thinking about it now, their urgency should’ve frightened me. But I was naive and invested in my game, so I continued playing until the house went completely dark.

Reluctantly accepting that it was time for bed, I gathered up my Lego warriors and put them where they wouldn’t get stepped on. Once all of them were safely accounted for, I looked out a nearby window and noticed twin lights staring out of the trees.

At first, I was scared. But as my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realized it was just some critter out for an evening stroll. I knew that animals roamed the woods at night, but I’d never seen one get that close to the house before. Overcome by childish excitement, I waved hello to it. It waved back.

“Carson!?” Dad hissed, doing his best to stay quiet. “Where’re you at, bud?”

“Shh!” I whispered back. “You’ll scare it off!”

“What!?”

Dad bolted into the room, his footsteps a clumsy contrast to the stillness of the night. I looked away from the window to shush him. When I turned back, the thing was gone.

“Never mind, Dad,” I said with a shrug. “It ran away.”

Dad sighed in relief and picked me up. I felt his heartbeat thunder in his chest as he checked to make sure the window was shut.

“Don’t worry about it,” he whispered in a strained voice. “C’mon, let’s get to bed.”

Mom and Dad had me sleep with them for some reason, but otherwise the rest of the night was completely normal. There was no cataclysm, no punishment for breaking the rules, no ominous sense of dread lingering over the house. Life continued on normally, unaffected by the night’s mistake. My parents were nervous at first, but laughed it off after a week or two.

They never suspected something was off because Mr. Pallywag was smart about it.



I still remember the day Mr. Pallywag introduced himself. Mom had left me to my own devices again, so I went out to the backyard and invented some game to keep myself occupied. Whatever I’d come up with must’ve been good, because I was so absorbed in what I was doing it took me a while to realize someone was watching me.

For a while, I pretended it was my imagination. But when I couldn’t ignore the feeling of eyes peering out from the woods any longer, I stopped and scowled at the trees.

“Quit being weird!” I shouted, my courage bolstered by youthful ignorance. “Come on out!”

In response to my demands, a large bipedal creature shuffled out from the treeline. It was covered in a shaggy coat of grey fur, and its small, dark eyes reminded me of a great white shark’s. It would’ve been frightening if not for the porkpie hat lightly perched on top of its head. Between the hat and its spotless white gloves, it looked more like a cartoon character come to life than an animal. 

“Hello,” the creature said with a shy, friendly wave. “Do you live here?”

“Uh huh.”

“Oh, good. I’m your neighbor, Mr. Pallywag. Sorry it took so long for me to introduce myself. What’s your name?”

“Carson.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Carson. Are your parents home?”

“Mom is, so you should stay back. She doesn’t like it when animals get too close to the house.”

Mr. Pallywag frowned, which made him look even more cartoonish. I couldn’t help laughing at his expression.

“I don’t see what’s so funny!” Mr. Pallywag huffed. “I’m not an animal! I’m a respectable citizen.”

“I’m sorry. You made a funny face, that’s all.”

“Oh, that’s not a funny face. This is!”

Mr. Pallywag stuck out his tongue and bulged his eyes. It looked so goofy I nearly passed out from laughter.

I laughed so loudly, Mom popped her head out of the window and asked me, “What’s so funny, Carson?”

“Mr. Pallywag made a funny face!”

“Mr. Pallywag…?”

“Yeah! Don’t you see him?”

Mom scanned the trees, a frown firmly etched on her face. I looked behind me to find that Mr. Pallywag had disappeared.

“That’s weird,” I said. “He was right here.”

“Honey, who’s Mr. Pallywag?”

“He’s a big, furry monster wearing a hat. You can’t miss him!”

“Oh,” Mom sighed, relieved. “He’s imaginary, then.”

Part of me wanted to argue, but I stayed quiet. If Mom didn’t want to believe Mr. Pallywag was real, that was her choice. Nothing worth arguing over. Besides, adults always hated being wrong. An argument could only end with me getting dragged inside.

“Well, I’ll leave you boys to it. Have fun, okay?”

“Okay.”

Mom went back to whatever she was doing. Once he was sure she wouldn’t come back, Mr. Pallywag popped out from behind a tree and grinned at me.

“Sorry I called you a monster,” I said quickly. “But you got mad when I said animal, so–”

“That’s alright, Carson. I understand. But I won’t forgive you unless you do something for me.”

“What’s that?”

“Play a game with me!” Mr. Pallywag cried, dramatically flourishing his hat.

“Okay!”

And just like that, I made a friend.



Mr. Pallywag came to visit me as much as he could. Sometimes he’d go missing for days or even weeks, but I didn’t mind. He always made up for it with a fantastic new story about his travels. I always liked stories, but my parents rarely told me any. Most nights it was too dark to read anything, and they were too busy during the day. Luckily, telling stories was Mr. Pallywag’s favorite pastime, and I was happy to listen.

Some nights, when I had trouble falling asleep, I would even crack the window open so Mr. Pallywag could continue telling me about his adventures. He was always happy to do it, but he never came into my room. I asked him why once, but he just shook his head and said my parents wouldn’t like it.

That makes sense to me now, but at the time I thought it was silly. Mom didn’t mind Mr. Pallywag at all. Dad did at first, but then one night he and Mom had a fight about it. It got really intense until Mom said it was perfectly normal for a kid with no friends to make one up. That made Dad go quiet. He didn’t say anything about Mr. Pallywag again.

I can’t blame my parents for thinking Mr. Pallywag was imaginary. He was very good at hiding. In fact, he was so good that at first I tried to make a game out of catching him. 

“Look, mommy!” I’d squeal with delight. “He’s behind the swingset! No, no, now he’s behind the sandbox!” 

But eventually, I let him hide without calling attention to it. He was quiet as the wind and quick as a fox, and nobody could find him if he didn’t want to be found. I also got the feeling something bad would happen if my parents caught him. I didn’t want that. He was my best friend.



Most of the time Mr. Pallywag was content to play in my backyard, but he asked me to come into the woods with him twice. The first time happened because Mom yelled at me.

Before I tell this part, I want to make it clear that Mom was not abusive. That said, she wasn’t exactly mother of the year either. There were mitigating circumstances, granted. She didn’t have a lot of friends, and we didn’t leave the house much because of our isolation. Most days she was either alone or only had me for company.

If that doesn’t sound so bad, imagine being trapped in a remote cabin and the only person you can have a conversation with refuses to talk about anything that isn’t related to cartoons or how hungry they are. Frankly, it’s a miracle she didn’t kill me.

I was usually content to entertain myself, but one day, for whatever reason, all I wanted to do was spend time with her.

“Mom! Come play with me!” I whined.

“Not right now, honey,” she said, doing her best to keep her voice calm. “Why don’t you watch a movie?”

“I don’t wanna!”

“Well, how about you play your Playstation?”

“No! I wanna play a real life game!”

“Okay… well, why don’t you ask Mr. Pallywag to play with you?”

“I don’t wanna play with Mr. Pallywag! I wanna play with you!”

“Carson–”

“I wanna play! I wanna play!”

My tantrum raged on like that for a while. Mom tried to soothe me, but I refused to be sated. Finally, she snapped and shouted “ENOUGH!”

The force of the shout shut me up immediately.

“I can’t play with you right now, Carson! I need some time to myself, okay!? Just shut up and go outside!”

With that, Mom stormed to her bedroom and slammed the door shut. Tears welled up in my eyes as I scurried outside. It was my first rejection. I remember it better than my first kiss.

For what felt like hours, I sat on my swingset and bawled. If Mom noticed, she didn’t come out to comfort me. Odds are she was just holed up in the house somewhere, but at the time it felt like she was actively ignoring me.

“Hey, Carson!”

Mr. Pallywag’s sudden appearance didn’t surprise me. He’d made a habit of showing up out of nowhere. Normally I pretended to be surprised, but I was so depressed I couldn’t summon the energy for it.

“Carson?” Mr. Pallywag asked. “You okay?”

“M-Mom yelled at me,” I choked out between sniffles.

“Oh no. Come here, bud. It’s okay.”

Mr. Pallywag opened his arms and wrapped me in a big hug. I always liked Mr. Pallywag’s hugs. It was like hugging a big warm pillow. There was something else about them too, something that made you feel safe and protected. Kind of like falling asleep.

“Tell you what,” Mr. Pallywag said when I calmed down enough. “How about we do something special today?”

“Special?”

“Yeah! I’m gonna show you the best spot in the entire forest.”

“I dunno… Mom and Dad said I can’t go into the woods because it’s dangerous.”

“That’s not true,” Mr. Pallywag replied as he patted my head. “They said you can’t go into the woods alone. You’re not alone if I’m with you, right? Besides, they won’t even know you’re gone if we’re quick enough.”

For a moment, I hesitated. I was a good kid. I always followed the rules. But Mr. Pallywag had a point. If I was with him, I wouldn’t be alone. And I wanted to get back at Mom somehow. I could bend the rules a little. Just once.

“Okay,” I said. “But we have to be quick.”

“Deal!”

Mr. Pallywag took my hand, and we walked into the woods together. It was a beautiful day. Birds chirped sonatas above us, and sunlight slipped through the cracks in the tree branches to cast macabre shadows on the ground. I made a game out of jumping from sunspot to sunspot. Mr. Pallywag thought it looked like fun, so he joined in as well. The two of us got so wrapped up in the game I almost forgot how upset I’d been. 

Almost.

Eventually our route led us to a circular clearing. Mr. Pallywag strolled to the center of it and sat down with a great big sigh. I followed his lead and inspected my surroundings. The clearing felt peaceful, but there was something vaguely sad about it too.

“This is my special spot, Carson,” Mr. Pallywag said. “What do you think?”

“I like it. But what makes it so special?”

“Well, this is where most of my friends decide to come to the party.”

“Party? What party?”

“Why, only the greatest, most fantabulous party ever! There’s cake, balloons, and games galore! And there’s plenty of music, and dancing…”

“And stories?”

“Of course!” Mr. Pallywag laughed. “All the stories you could ever want!”

“That sounds nice,” I said, trying to imagine it. “Are there other kids there?”

“Oh yes. Tons of kids.”

“Does everyone get along?”

“Of course!”

“And nobody’s left out?”

“Nope!”

“Good.”

We sat in silence for a while. I didn’t mind. Silences felt okay with Mr. Pallywag. Not like when Dad went quiet. That was usually a sign he was about to start lecturing me about how I didn’t clean my room enough or that I was spending too much time on the television or something. It wasn’t like when Mom got quiet either. When she got quiet it was because she was mad and didn’t want us to know. It didn’t work, though. I always knew.

Something in the trees caught my eye. It was slowly swinging back and forth, like the pendulum in my Grandma’s old clock. I watched it for a while, back and forth, back and forth, but couldn’t figure out what it was. Part of me wanted to go take a closer look, but Mr. Pallywag squeezed my shoulder before I had the chance.

“Okay, Carson,” he said. “It’s time to go back home now.”

“Aw, really? Can’t we go to the party instead?”

Mr. Pallywag grinned. For the first time, I noticed how large his teeth were. They weren’t sharp fangs or anything. They were just… large. I had a sudden urge to run away, but I ignored it.

“One day,” Mr. Pallywag said, taking my hand. “But not just yet.”

“Why not?”

“You’re not sad enough.”

I wasn’t sure what Mr. Pallywag meant, but I let him lead me away from the clearing without complaint. As we entered the woods I glanced over my shoulder, hoping to get one last look at whatever was swaying back there. No luck. It was too well-hidden by the foliage.

“Let’s race!” Mr. Pallywag said. “Last one there’s a grounded swallow!”

Mr. Pallywag let go of my hand and sprinted into the woods. I ran after him, the swinging object forgotten. When we got back, he stopped me and knelt down to my eye level.

“One quick thing before you go,” Mr. Pallywag whispered. “Promise you won’t tell your parents about my special place. Okay?”

“Why not?”

“Well, it’s not very special if everyone knows about it, right?”

It made sense, but there was an icky feeling in my gut as I nodded and swore to keep it a secret.

“Thanks, Carson. I’ll see you later, okay?”

I smiled and nodded again. Mr. Pallywag grinned and gave me a big hug goodbye. I hugged him back and walked into the house. When I ambled into the kitchen, I found Mom crying at the kitchen table.

“Mom?”

“Carson!” Mom wailed. “Where were you!?”

She didn’t let me answer before she scrambled over and wrapped me in a bone-crushing hug.

“I’m fine, mommy,” I said, shocked. “I just went into the woods with Mr. Pallywag.”

“Carson, what have I told you about going into the woods alone!?”

“But I wasn’t alone, Mr. Pallywag was–”

“Mr. Pallywag doesn’t count! You’re not allowed to leave the backyard unless you’re with me or daddy! Do you understand?”

“But–”

“No buts! Honestly, what were you thinking!?”

“It was Mr. Pallywag’s idea. He said–”

“I don’t care what he said! I was worried sick about you!”

I thought about protesting more, but I didn’t bother. There was no use fighting her.



As promised, I didn’t tell my parents about Mr. Pallywag’s secret spot. I didn’t tell them about the party either. Something in my gut said they wouldn’t like it.

At some point I went back to school, but the only thing I remember about it is getting bullied. I tried talking to the nicer kids about Mr. Pallywag once. They didn’t care. I stopped trying.

Thinking back on it, nobody in my family had many friends. I guess that’s why we all loved Uncle Dan so much. 

Uncle Dan was born in that backwater town and never quite managed to escape, but he didn’t let it get to him. My parents liked him, and I was thrilled whenever he came over. He was no Mr. Pallywag, mind, but he was the closest anyone got.

Unlike most adults, Uncle Dan took time to make sure I was feeling okay. He was a great listener too. No matter what the topic was, he’d patiently allow me to ramble about it until I’d exhausted myself. If it was something bad, he’d offer sympathy or advice. If I was just talking about Power Rangers or my latest video game, he’d run his fingers through his thick red beard and let out a low whistle of amazement.

“Wow,” he’d say in a tone implying I’d solved world hunger. “That really is something, kiddo. Thanks for sharing.”

When most people said stuff like that, I knew they were only saying it to humor me. Uncle Dan was special because I believed him.

One time I asked Uncle Dan why he liked talking to me so much. He got real serious and said it reminded him of spending time with his daughter. I asked if I could meet her sometime. He got real quiet and shook his head. I didn’t ask about her again.

For some reason, the one thing I didn’t tell Uncle Dan about was Mr. Pallywag. In fact, he might never have known if I hadn’t shown him my drawing. It was just a crayon scribble of Mr. Pallywag waving hello, but I’d gotten the hat just right and I was proud of my work. Obviously, the next time Uncle Dan came over I made it a priority to show him my masterpiece.

“Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan! Lookit what I drew!” I chirped as I shoved the drawing at him.

“Carson!” Dad scolded, smiling despite himself. “Give him a second to breathe!”

“That’s alright, Keith,” Uncle Dan chuckled. “Let’s see what Picasso whipped up for us.”

Uncle Dan ruffled my hair and took the drawing. The second he saw what it was his smile vanished. I waited for him to say something, suddenly self-conscious. He was quiet for so long I looked to Dad for reassurance. He looked just as confused as I was.

“Uncle Dan?” I asked.

“It’s, uh… it’s great, Carson,” Uncle Dan replied, his hands and voice shaking. “Great job. What’s this fella’s name?”

“Mr. Pallywag.”

Uncle Dan’s face went pale.

“That’s… fun,” he said in a low, emotionless voice. “Carson, would you excuse us for a moment? There’s something I need to talk to your dad about.”

“Um… okay…”

Unnerved, I left the room. I’d never seen an adult act like that before. I knew I shouldn’t have eavesdropped, but I was so worried about Uncle Dan I stopped by the doorway to listen in.

“Jesus, Dan, what’s wrong? You look pale.”

“How long has Carson been talking about this thing?”

“I’m sorry?”

“Mr. Pallywag. How long?”

“Oh, right. A couple of months, I think?”

“Months!?” Uncle Dan yelled.

“Yeah, the kid’s got an imaginary friend. So what?”

“Have you been leaving the lights on?”

“No, of course not… well, okay, we did once. But that was–”

“Fuck!”

Mom must’ve walked in, because I heard her ask, “What’s going–? Dan! Are you alright?”

“You have to move,” Uncle Dan insisted. “*Now.*”

“Move? I don’t–”

“We’re not moving!” Dad snapped.

“Don’t give me that tough guy shit, Keith! Christ, I should’ve figured this would happen…”

“Excuse me? What gives you the right to–!?”

“Shut up and listen! Jenny… Jenny drew that thing too. Right before… before…”

The house went deathly quiet. I could just barely hear Uncle Dan quietly sobbing. It made me uncomfortable, so I slunk off to my room. I didn’t come out until Mom called me for dinner.

As I sat down at the table, I looked over to Uncle Dan. It was like nothing had happened. He even shot me a cheerful thumbs up.

“Sorry for the scare, kiddo,” he said. “I remembered something really important. Boring grownup stuff, nothing you need to worry about.”

I nodded and pretended everything was fine. Uncle Dan was doing a good job acting normal, but my parents couldn’t keep up the facade. Little things gave them away. They’d laugh a little too long at Uncle Dan’s jokes, or they’d shoot me worried glances when they thought I wasn’t looking.

The second Uncle Dan left, my folks turned out the lights. 

“Carson, why don’t you go get ready for bed?” Mom asked. 

“But it isn’t even dark yet...”

“I know. But your dad wants to read you a story.”

“Really!?”

“Yes, really.”

I dashed to the bathroom and got ready for bed in record time. When I was done, I jumped into bed and Dad walked in with a beat-up old book.

“Hey, bud,” Dad said in a soft voice. “All set?”

I nodded, too excited to speak.

“Good. I’ve been saving this one until you were old enough. It’s called *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland…*”

With great care, Dad gingerly flipped to the first chapter and began to read. I fell in love with it immediately.

After finishing the chapter about poor old Bill the Lizard, Dad shut the book and smiled at me.

“Well? Liking it so far?”

“Yeah! It kinda reminds me of Mr. Pallywag’s stories.”

The corner of Dad’s mouth flickered.

“Oh yeah?” he asked.

“Yeah. You do the voices better, though.”

“Well. Glad I’ve got that going for me.”

Suddenly, Dad sniffed and wrapped me in a gigantic hug. That startled me. Dad wasn’t opposed to hugging, but he rarely initiated.

“Carson…  you know Mom and I love you very much, right?”

“Uh huh.”

“And that we only want what’s best for you. Right?”

“Uh huh.”

“Okay. Good.”

I hugged him back and we sat there for a while in uncomfortable silence. It might’ve been my imagination, but I swear I felt a tear drop onto the back of my neck.

After what felt like forever, Dad sighed, let me go, and gently punched my shoulder.

“Good night, kiddo,” Dad said softly. “Love you.”

“Love you too, Dad.”

Dad smiled, turned out the light, and shut the door. I sat in bed and watched the sunset. I had a feeling something significant had happened, but I was too young to understand what it was.



My parents were different after that night. Dad used to be content to spend weekends at home, but suddenly he wanted to spend every free moment away from the house. The nearest thing to do was an hours’ drive away, but he didn’t care. The longer the trip, the better.

Mom changed too. She went from always wanting space to constantly occupying mine. If I was playing video games, she’d read her book on the couch nearby. If I was making something with my Lego sets, she would develop a keen interest in the construction effort. If I vaguely stated I was interested in something, she’d help me become the world’s expert in it.

Because of my parents’ sudden interest in my affairs, I didn’t see Mr. Pallywag for weeks. They never officially told me to stop talking about him, but I could tell they didn’t like him anymore. Whenever I mentioned wanting to play in the backyard, they always found some excuse to keep me inside the house.

Then one night, my parents sat me down to talk. Neither bothered hiding the relieved expressions on their faces.

“Great news, buddy!” Dad said. “I got a new job! We’re going to be moving soon!”

“Really?”

“Yep! We’re going to the city, far away from these boring old woods!”

“What about Mr. Pallywag?”

“Well, Mr. Pallywag is staying here,” Mom replied, shooting my Dad an unreadable glance.

“What!? Why can’t he come with us?”

“He just can’t,” Dad said forcefully. “I mean… the forest is his home, right? It wouldn’t be fair to make him move out too.”

“If he can’t come, I don’t want to leave!”

“Carson…”

“NO!!!”

Despite my parents’ best efforts, I bawled for hours. No matter what they tried, I refused to be comforted. I loved my parents and Uncle Dan, sure, but they were family. Mr. Pallywag was my only friend.

I was inconsolable until I remembered Mr. Pallywag’s party. Somehow my childish logic determined that the party was the solution to all my problems. If I could just figure out how to get there, everything would be alright. I wouldn’t have to move. I wouldn’t have to leave Mr. Pallywag behind. I wouldn’t have to feel alone.



My feelings about the move didn’t deter my parents’ plans. Within a week, they had all of our stuff packed and ready to go. I tried my hardest to see Mr. Pallywag, but Mom and Dad refused to leave my side. It was looking like I’d never get to go to the party.

Then, when I’d finally given up hope, I stumbled into my opening. The day before the move, Dad was trying yet again to sell me on our new home.

“You’re going to love it, bud,” he said. “There are lots of other kids in the neighborhood.”

I didn’t reply. The phone rang. Dad ignored it. I faintly heard Mom answer it in the other room.

“I bet you’ll make tons of new friends,” he said.

“No I won’t. They’ll be mean to me.”

“You don’t know that.”

“Yeah I do.”

“Honey?” Mom called. “It’s the mill. Something about paperwork?”

Dad swore under his breath and dashed out of the room. I stayed behind and scanned the room, bored. That’s when I saw the unguarded back door.

I knew I wouldn’t get another chance. I crept to the door and opened it as quietly as I could. After making sure my parents weren’t coming, I scanned the trees for any signs of life.

“Mr. Pallywag?” I whispered. “Mr. Pallywag, are you there?”

“Shh! Over here, Carson. Quick!”

Without thinking, I bolted into the woods. I didn’t get far before something strong and furry yanked me behind a tree. It put a hand over my mouth and shushed me.

“Carson?” I heard Dad call. “Carson, where’d you get to?”

“Stay quiet, okay?” Mr. Pallywag whispered in my ear.

“Carson? This isn’t funny! CARSON!!!”

Mr. Pallywag placed me on his back, dropped to all fours, and dashed into the woods. I gasped and held on tightly to his neck. I’d never seen Mr. Pallywag run that fast before. It was exhilarating.

I would’ve enjoyed it more if Dad hadn’t sounded so distraught.



This next part won’t make sense unless I talk about Eli Miller. Bad timing, I know, but bear with me.

I didn’t know Eli very well. He was a teenager, and even if we were the same age he wasn’t the type of guy Mom would want me to hang out with. He was the resident “troubled kid.” Graffiti, antagonizing the police, drinking, that kind of thing. Dad always shook his head whenever he came up. I think that was his way of saying he felt sorry for him.

Even though I heard a lot of stories about Eli, I only saw him in person once. Mom had dragged me along on a shopping trip to our local Dollar General, and I wasn’t overly thrilled about being there. Normally Mom insisted that I stay close to her when she was shopping, but that day she said I could browse the books by myself as long as I didn’t leave the aisle. I was thrilled. It was one of my first tastes of freedom, and I capitalized on it immediately.

As I browsed through the scattered copies of *Animorphs* and *Goosebumps*, Eli strolled into the aisle without a care in the world. He whistled a tuneless song, picked a magazine off the shelf, and casually flipped through it. I was so low to the ground that he didn’t notice me.

Something about the way Eli flipped through the magazine made me stop and watch him with juvenile fascination. After a minute or two, Eli scanned the store. When he thought nobody was watching, he casually slipped the magazine into the inner pocket of his jacket. A perfect crime.

That was when he caught me staring at him. He froze, his hand still clutching his stolen loot. I knew I should’ve called someone over or told him off for stealing or something. Instead, I put a finger to my lips. Eli smirked, nodded at me, and walked away.

He didn’t get to the end of the aisle before he stopped and looked back at me. I kept my finger on my lips in silent assurance. A weird expression spread across his face. He rocked on the balls of his feet and kept glancing from me to the door. He was home free and he knew it. And yet...

Eli shut his eyes and sighed. He removed the magazine from his pocket and put it back on the shelf. I cocked my head, confused.

“Don’t steal, kid,” Eli whispered.

I smiled at him and nodded. He shot me a wink and left the store. I never told anybody else about it, but that little encounter left a big impact on me. Weird as it sounds, Eli transformed into a sort of Robin Hood figure in my head. Someone who understood right and wrong in a way stuffy adults couldn’t. He was a living legend. A hero, maybe.

That’s why I was devastated when he killed himself.

I never got the full story. From what I heard, the poor kid hung himself in the woods without leaving a note. It took a week for anyone to notice he’d gone missing. Took another two for somebody to find him.

What hurt me most was the injustice of it. In all the stories I’d heard, dying alone in the woods was a fate reserved for villains. Eli deserved better. It wasn’t fair.

After Eli’s death, I had a recurring nightmare. In it, I’d be walking alone in the woods. I could feel something watching me, but I couldn’t see it because it was hidden by the trees. Eventually I’d start running, but thick vines would lash around my throat and yank me off the forest floor. The vines would lift me off the ground by the neck, higher, higher, and the higher I got the harder it was to breathe and I would choke and choke and choke until I finally woke up, panicking and screaming.

I still have that nightmare sometimes.

	

Mr. Pallywag didn’t stop running until we reached his secret spot. I gave him a moment to catch his breath, then climbed off and wrapped him in a massive hug.

“I missed you,” I whispered.

“I missed you too.”

“I’m moving away tomorrow.”

“I know.”

“I don’t want to leave,” I sniffled. “Can I go to the party instead?”

There was a brief pause.

“Oh, I don’t know,” Mr. Pallywag said with calculated indifference. “I’m sure you’d have much more fun living in your fancy new house in the city.”

“No, Mr. Pallywag! I don’t want to move! I want to stay here with you!”

“More than anything?”

I nodded.

“More than anything in the whole wide world?”

I nodded again and looked up to see Mr. Pallywag’s expression. He was grinning, and there was a triumphant expression in his dark eyes.

“Well, if you’re absolutely sure,” he said, “I guess I can arrange it. But there’s a few things we have to do first.”

“Like what?”

Mr. Pallywag pulled off his hat and rummaged around inside it.

“Let me see… it’s around here somewhere… ah, there it is!”

With solemn dignity, Mr. Pallywag pulled a long, thick rope out of his hat. The rope kept going and going, to the point where I laughed at how absurdly long it was. Mr. Pallywag laughed too and ended the bit by dumping the rest onto the ground. Then, suddenly serious, he picked up one end of the rope and held it where I could see.

“Watch carefully, Carson,” he said. “You have to get this just right, or it won’t work.”

I paid close attention as Mr. Pallywag slowly tied a knot with the rope. It wasn’t very complicated. A couple simple moves, and he’d made a knot which left a big loop at the end. When he was done, Mr. Pallywag undid the knot and handed me the rope.

“Easy, right? Now you try.”

Slowly, I copied Mr. Pallywag’s technique. My knot looked just like his when I was done. He took the rope and gave it a couple firm yanks. The knot held.

“Great job, Carson! You’re so smart. Now watch this.”

Mr. Pallywag held up the rope and snapped his fingers. To my amazement, the inside of the loop shimmered, blurred together, and rearranged into strange, kaleidoscopic shapes.

“Wow!” I exclaimed. “Is that magic!?”

“Of course it is, Carson! Not only that, it’s a portal that goes directly to the party. Here, have a look!”

Mr. Pallywag held out the rope and I leaned in closer to see. There was a large room on the other side of the portal. The room was brightly decorated and filled wall to wall with people. Most of them were kids. No sound came through the portal, but I could see people having animated conversations and laughing.

What a party it was! It was everything I’d hoped it would be. There was cake and pizza, and a ton of TVs with all my favorite movies and games on them. Everyone was having so much fun. I didn’t see anyone who looked excluded or bullied or unwanted. It was like something out of a dream.

A red-haired girl on the other side of the portal noticed me and enthusiastically waved hello. I waved back. The girl pointed me out to some of the other partygoers, and they all began beckoning me over. I couldn’t hear them, but I could see their mouths moving as they shouted encouragement.

For some reason I couldn’t stop staring at the girl. She looked vaguely familiar, but Mr. Pallywag yanked the rope away before I could figure out why.

“Now,” Mr. Pallywag began, “there are a few things we have to do before you can go to the party. Are you ready?”

“Uh huh!”

“Great! First, you’ll need your invitation.”

Mr. Pallywag cleared his throat, grinned a wide, toothy smile, and took a deep bow.

“Carson! On this most momentous of days, I hereby offer you an exclusive invitation to the greatest party there ever is, was, or will be, good for whenever, wherever, whatever, and forever! Do you accept?”

I giggled and said, “Yes!”

A soft wind blew through the trees. Something changed, something subtle. A muffled static in the air. A slight shift to the left. A delay so tiny no one would ever notice. The only word I can think of to describe it is magic settling in, old and powerful magic mankind chose to leave behind. I didn’t like it.

“Wonderful!” Mr. Pallywag said, clapping his hands. “Just two more steps, and you can go to the party! The first one’s easy. All you have to do is pick a tree.”

I nodded and began inspecting the nearby trees in turn. Midway through my search, something in the forest stole my attention. I squinted and leaned towards it to get a better look.

It was a yellow strip of police tape. The strip blew gently in the breeze, tracing lazy shapes in the air. It marked the spot where I’d seen the swinging thing last time.

I frowned and turned back to Mr. Pallywag. He was still smiling, but there was something hard in his eyes.

“Something wrong, Carson?”

“No.”

“Good. Which tree did you pick?”

Despite a sudden sense of unease, I pointed at my tree. Mr. Pallywag walked me over to it and positioned me under one of the branches. The branch looked thick and sturdy.

“Good choice, Carson. Very good choice.”

Mr. Pallywag nodded in approval and showed me the portal again. The red-haired girl was there, waiting for me. She shot me a huge, sincere smile and held up a slice of cake. It was my favorite, a corner piece of red velvet with tons of icing. The icing had even been lathered into a big letter C, just for me.

“Hey, Mr. Pallywag,” I said, unable to contain my curiosity. “Who’s that girl?”

“Oh, that’s Jenny. She’s a very good friend of mine. Do you two know each other?”

The name was familiar, but I couldn’t place it. I shook my head.

“Well, you’ll get to know each other soon enough. Just one last step, and you’ll be at the party!”

“What is it?”

“It’s very easy. Just put your head through the loop and close your eyes real tight.”

An intense shaky feeling shot through my body. I took an involuntary step back.

“What’s wrong?” Mr. Pallywag asked. “Everyone’s waiting. See?”

His smile didn’t waver as he pointed at the portal. All of the partygoers were gathered in a big crowd. They were clapping and chanting something. I couldn’t hear them, but I knew it was my name. I instinctively scanned their faces. It didn’t take me long to find the one I was looking for. When he caught me looking at him, he held a finger to his lips and winked.

Eli.

I felt the blood drain from my face as I backed away from the rope. Mr. Pallywag chuckled.

“It’s okay, Carson,” he said, his voice as friendly as ever. “I won’t lie, it’s scary at first. But don’t worry! When it’s done you get to stay at the party forever. Just you, me, and all of our friends. Doesn’t that sound fun?”

Mr. Pallywag’s grin widened. I’d never realized how big he was before. About the size of a grizzly bear, maybe even bigger. I wanted to run, but I’d seen how fast he was. There was no way I’d be able to get away from him.

I thought about the night Dad read me *Alice.* About the long hug he gave me, and the tear rolling down my neck. With as much courage as I could muster, I shook my head.

“I don’t want to go to the party anymore.”

“Don’t be silly, Carson. Everyone wants to go to the party.”

“I don’t.”

“Carson.”

I shook my head again. Mr. Pallywag stopped smiling.

“Did you know I can see the future, Carson?” he asked in a low growl. “I saw yours the moment I met you. Want to know what I saw?”

“No.”

“It’s so awful it makes me want to cry,” he said, his mouth contorting into a massive frown. “You’re always a little bit… different. A little bit off. People don’t notice it at first. But they always find out. And when they do, they abandon you.”

“Shut up! You’re lying!”

“No, I’m not,” Mr. Pallywag droned, an annoyed teacher lecturing his student. “You’re going to end up all alone, Carson. No lovers. No friends. Eventually, you won’t even have a family. No mommy or daddy or Uncle Dan. Nothing but a slow, depressing slide into endless misery.”

“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!”

“Don’t fight it, Carson. You already know I’m right.”

Something rustled in the woods. Dad’s panicked voice echoed out soon after.

“Carson!? Carson, where are you!?”

The corner of Mr. Pallywag’s mouth flickered. I started to yell, but Mr. Pallywag was on me in a flash. I closed my eyes and waited for the rope to close around my neck.

To my surprise, Mr. Pallywag just clasped his hand over my mouth. When I opened my eyes, he was grinning at me again.

“You already accepted the invitation,” he said. “Just follow the steps when you change your mind.”

I nodded, too afraid to do anything else. Mr. Pallywag chuckled, uncovered my mouth, and walked away.

“Goodbye, Carson. See you soon.”

In the blink of an eye, Mr. Pallywag was gone.

Dad burst out of the trees moments later. When he saw me, he nearly bowled me over and wrapped me in a hug so tight I thought my spine would snap.

“Thank God,” Dad kept whispering. “Thank you God, thank you...”

I didn’t say anything. Dad took me home, Mom held me close, and none of us ever discussed the incident again. We were too relieved to jinx the miracle.



The move went as planned. I never went back to those woods again.

I did my best to move on. Tried to make friends, even attempted dating a few times. But so far, Mr. Pallywag’s been right. Nobody stays. My parents are still alive, but we don’t talk much anymore. Uncle Dan’s dead. I talk to my coworkers a little, but I’m basically alone.

Sometimes, on really bad nights, I pull out some rope and tie that special knot. I let the loop shimmer, peek through the portal, and watch the party. More people join every year. Jenny and Eli are still there. They haven’t aged a day. They look happy.

Mr. Pallywag is there too, of course. He always knows when I’m watching. He stops what he’s doing, looks me in the eye, and waves at me. I wave back. When he knows he has my full attention, he claps his hands and leads his guests in a mad dance. He whirls among them, hat in hand, dancing and singing and laughing. The party guests follow along, delirious with glee.

I’ve tried to find a flaw with the party. An ulterior motive, or a sign that it’s part of some sinister master plan. The problem is, it’s perfect. Nobody disappears. Nobody’s in pain. There’s nothing there but fun and games and acceptance and love. 

Even though it’s hard, I don’t want to give up. I tell myself stories where I’m the hero, and no matter how dark it gets, I have to live. It’s worked for a while. But every year gets harder. And deep down, I’m scared Mr. Pallywag was right. 

It’s not if I go to the party. It’s when.
