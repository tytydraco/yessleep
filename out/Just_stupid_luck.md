“Tommy... Tommy... Wake up.” 

She was one of the only people who could call me Tommy. To pretty much everyone else it was just Tom, except for Mom who insisted on calling me Thomas. 

I slowly opened my eyes, squinting up at the late afternoon sun. Seagulls drifted lazily in the ocean breeze overhead. 

“We’re gonna be late.” Said Jen. 

I sat up on the beach towel, rubbing sand out of my shaggy black hair. “Is it that time already?” I asked. 

My girlfriend had brought me home to Galveston, where her parents still lived at the time. It wasn't until later on when her mom got sick that they moved closer to us in Oklahoma. This was going to be my first time meeting them and I was pretty nervous. Some of my old impulses were kicking in as I reached for the cooler. 

Jen, reading my expression, smiled down at me as her wavy brown hair danced in the ocean breeze. “Don't worry, they are going to love you.”  

I smiled back at her as I pulled a bottle of coke from the cooler and cracked it open. I had been alcohol free for about a month on that trip. When I was in my early 20s, I had developed a serious drinking problem after the accident that killed my younger brother. With a lot of help and support from Jen and my family, and a lot of therapy, I was finally sober and planning to stay that way. 

I climbed to my feet and wrapped her in my arms holding her tightly. “And why will they love me exactly?” I asked. 

Jen smiled and kissed me deeply, “Because I love you.” 

I smiled back and we gathered our things before starting off down the beach, hand in hand. 

After going back to our hotel room and getting cleaned up, we headed to the restaurant where we would be meeting her parents for the awkward get to know the new boyfriend dinner.  

He parents were already there, seated at the bar. As we walked through the crowded room, something seemed different, strange. Her mom looked normal, bur her dad... He was tall, bald, and wearing a gray suit.  

As we approached them, I felt sweat begin popping out on my forehead. Fear blossomed in my chest. That wasn't right, that wasn't what he was wearing when I met him, and he wasn't bald. I looked to Jen, but she carried on smiling and walking towards them, calling their names, just like she had back then. I tried to reach out to stop her, I had to stop this, it wasn't right, but my arm moved in slow motion as she stepped just out of my reach. 

Her parents turned and I felt my heart drop. It wasn't Jen's dad. It was him, the feral man in the gray suit, his face streaked with blood. Time stood still as a wicked smile spread on his face just before he pounced on Jen. I screamed and screamed as he began to tear her limb from limb.  

I shot awake, screaming and thrashing, looking around the unfamiliar room for the man, for Jen. I sat there for a moment breathing hard. Finally, it all came back to me, the past week and a half of hell I had been through. I was alone now, completely and utterly alone. The world I knew, the people I knew had all been whisked away. It might have been the rapture. It might have been some kind of plague, I didn't know. Everyone was gone, including Jen. And the world was now filled with monsters that looked like people. Ferals, I had started calling them. 

I sat on the edge of the bed in a small cabin I had found. It, like everything else, had no power. But it had thick walls, sturdy doors, and a wood fireplace. I had come across the cabin a few days ago and had spent a lot of the time since chopping wood for the winter and doing my best to reinforce the doors and windows. The cabin had an old hand pump well outside, so I had plenty of water, but I was starting to get uncomfortably low on food. So, I pulled on my boots, thinking that now was as good a time as any for a supply run. I stepped into the kitchen and grabbed the last granola bar from the box before filling my canteen and heading out the door.  

As I drove, it struck me again how eerie the empty roads were. Miles and miles of nothing but empty blacktop and stalled vehicles. My first stop after driving the six and a half miles to the nearest town was to Big-Mart. The nationwide superstore would have most of the provisions I would need. Food, bottled water, ammo for my rifle and just about anything else a crazy forest dwelling hermit could need. Well, almost anything. My next stop after that would be to the hardware store to pick up a couple generators. Gas station pumps didn't work anymore but I could siphon plenty of fuel from the stalled or parked vehicles around town. 

I pulled my truck to a stop in front of the Big-Mart doors and stepped out onto the pavement. Looking out over the packed-out parking lot I figured I could get enough fuel from just here to get me well through the next year. As I scanned the lot, my eyes fell on the sign for Captain Cluckey's. My stomach began to growl just thinking about the Cluckey super supreme burrito. Jen had always said that processed shit would kill me one day. Part of me wished it already had. I shook my head, attempting to banish those dark thoughts away. “No time for self-pity, you got work to do.” I told myself. 

The automatic doors didn't open when I stepped up to them, obviously. So, I used a large flat head screwdriver that I kept in my truck toolbox to pry the doors open. Taking a shopping basket and clicking on my small flashlight I headed into the darkened superstore. 

The squeak of my shopping carts wheels echoed throughout the huge store, a stark reminder of how loud the world used to be, and how quiet it was now. I took a deep steadying breath and pushed past the dropped bags of people's everyday items, groceries, socks, wrapping paper and toys. Seeing the evidence of people who were now gone always left me feeling sad and confused. But I shook it off and carried on with my shopping. 

After filling one cart with canned and dry foods and depositing them back at the truck, I noticed my flashlight had begun to flicker. “Batteries must be crapping out.” I thought. My next stop was the camping isle, where I ended up abandoning my crummy little flashlight and replacing it with a newer brighter model. I also took several more flashlights, headlamps, electric lanterns and a couple kerosene lanterns. I also pilfered the battery isle for pretty much everything they had. 

 Next up was the sporting goods isle. There I found only four boxes of ammo for my 30-30, but I figured 40 rounds was better than nothing.  Big-Mart didn't have a very big selection of firearms, mostly hunting rifles and shotguns. I scanned through the options and decided on a pump action shotgun, a Remington 870. I tossed it in the cart along with all of the 12-gauge ammo they had on the shelf. I wanted a handgun too, something good in close quarters that held lots of ammo. But unfortunately, they didn't sell handguns here so that would have to wait.  

After taking a K bar knife from the case, I decided I was good on weapons, at least for now. I wasn't looking for a fight, but I needed to be ready if one came. The ferals were viscous, cannibalistic and tough. If they came after me again, I wanted every advantage I could get.  

As I left the sporting goods department, something on the floor caught my eye. It was a baseball bat. An old fashion Louisville Slugger, exactly like the one that my dad had given me in fifth grade. I bent down and picked up the bat, running my hand across the surface, feeling the memory through the laminated wood. 

 

“Get up Tom.”  

I looked up at my dad standing over me. Tears burned in my eyes, and I could taste blood from where the ball had busted my lip.  

“Come on Tom, get up.” He said again. 

I sat up and climbed to my feet, dusting off my baseball uniform and adjusting the helmet on my head. I angrily wiped at the tears, hoping the other boys hadn't seen them. Dad placed his hand on my shoulder, and I shrugged it off, desperately wanting to not look weak. 

“I'm fine, can we just go? I don't want to play baseball anyway.” That wasn't true, but I felt like I was so bad at it that I shouldn't have even joined the team. 

Dad, who was the town sheriff and a very big man, knelt down in front of me. Even down on my level he seemed larger than life, a real-life superhero. He looked me in the eyes and said something that I will never forget. “Son, life is full of challenges. What most people don't realize is that success isn't about winning or losing. What matters isn't how many times you get knocked down, it's how many times you get back up. You can fall a thousand times but as long as you get back up and try again, you’ll never truly fail.”  

“What if I fall a thousand and one times?” I asked with a half grin. 

Dad shrugged, “Well maybe then give up.” 

We both laughed. 

I sniffed and nodded. “Okay, I’ll keep trying.”  

Dad smiled and handed me my bat, “I know you will.” 

 

I knelt there in the floor of the darkened superstore, holding the bat. I nodded to myself and maybe to the memory as well and placed the bat in the shopping cart. I would keep trying no matter what.  

 

After leaving Big-Mart I headed across town to the hardware store. While there I grabbed the generators and a handful of tools I thought might come in handy. Hammer and nails, a couple saws of varying sizes, and a new axe for chopping wood.  

When I was getting ready to leave the hardware store though, I saw something odd. On a patch of grass next to the store was what looked like a dark red fungus growing out of the ground. I stepped over to it and nudged it with the toe of my boot. When I did, the fungus oozed out a dark red liquid from pours on its underside. The liquid smelled exactly like the rain from the other night. “Oh, great.” I thought. “First it rains blood now I've got some kind of freaky ass blood fungus to worry about.”  

I looked down the alley next to the store and saw a trail of the blood fungi things. Unslinging my rifle and making sure I had a round chambered, I made my way down the alley to the empty lot behind the store.  

When I got there, I really wished I hadn't. The empty lot behind the hardware store wasn't empty, it was full of ferals. Dozens of them, and they were all sleeping. The blood fungus or whatever it was, had completely covered the grass. The ferals were sleeping on the stuff, like... like a nest.  

I began to slowly back away, back down the alley. I didn't know how they hadn't heard me loading up the generators, I wasn't exactly trying to be quiet about it. But luckily, I made it out of the alley and into my truck without incident.   

The drive back to the Cabin was pretty uneventful. As I made my way down the long country road, watching side to side for deer or ferals or whatever the world decided to throw at me I noticed something. From the top of the hill I was on I could see a small fenced in area situated in the middle of the forest. At first glance it looked like a military base of some kind. But as I slowed down and looked closer, I could see what it really was.  

I stopped and turned around, making my way to and then down the long winding gravel driveway. I pulled my truck to a stop and stepped out, my jaw nearly falling to the ground in awe.  

Standing right in front of me, behind a ten-foot chain-link fence topped with razor wire, was a huge two-story house, basically a mansion to a hick like me. And sitting atop the roof was a complete array of solar panels. 

 

As I stood there in front of the gate, I thought that this must be what it feels like to be both the luckiest and the unluckiest man alive. An absolute fortress right here, free for the taking, but not a soul left to share it with.  

The gate was secured with two heavy duty padlocks, that was problem number one. Problems two, three and four came rushing at me from the other side of the house when I rattled the gate. The three massive and very hungry looking German Shepherds came to a stop on the other side of the fence snapping and snarling at me. I stepped back and looked at them, then to the house. “Okay.” I said to myself, “Firstly, I need to get in and get the hell hounds out. Secondly, make sure I don't get eaten by said hellhounds.” I nodded to myself “I got this.” 

I went to my truck and pulled out a couple bags of jerky and one of the hand saws I had taken from the hardware store. I tore the bags open slightly but not all the way and tossed them over the fence. The dogs attacked the partially opened packages, fighting over their contents, while I went to work on the locks. 

I had hoped that the packages not being fully opened would mean that the dogs would have to work harder to get the jerky, giving me a little more time. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. Never underestimate the determination of an angry, hungry shepherd. While they did rip apart the packages and scarf down the dried meat in record time, they only glanced at me for a moment before returning their attention to the grease and crumb lined packaging. 

As the last lock thudded to the ground, the shepherds were beginning to return their attention to me. In one quick motion I flung the gate open and dashed back to my truck. As I ran, I could hear the snarls and the pounding feet of the dogs as they gained on me. Fortunately, I made it to the truck and slammed the door shut just as the leading dog leapt at me. The big shepherd's claws dug into the paint on the side of my truck as it jumped and bit at the window. I grinned and flipped the dog off as I started the truck and backed down the driveway, the three hell hounds following and barking like mad the whole way. 

 After tossing one last bag of jerky out the window for them to fight over, I pulled my truck forward through the gate and slid it closed. Securing it with a couple bungie cords for now. I'd find some new locks or some other way of securing the gate later, for now I had some exploring to do. 

The front door to the mansion was wide open, probably had been since the change. The house was, impressive to say the least. The walls of the first floor were covered with photos, medals and military decor. From the looks of things, the previous owner had been a Vietnam vet, and a very decorated one at that. Among the photos were several patches of different ranks and units, one of which I recognized as delta force. Another photo showed a man, presumably the owner, holding a comically large publishers clearing house check. I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of just stumbling upon this place. 

He had spent his money well it seemed. In the front room, there was a huge couch and recliner sat next to a stone fireplace bigger than any fireplace actually needed to be. And as tacky as it was, I had to admire the large bear skin rug sprawled across the floor. On the second floor there were three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The guest rooms were decorated fairly plainly but the master bedroom looked like it had belonged to the likes of Tony Stark. A king size bed, complete with silk sheets, a massive flatscreen tv and another damn fireplace.  

After making my way downstairs, I noticed another door next to the kitchen. The door led down another flight of stairs to a basement. When I turned on the basement lights, my jaw dropped again. It was basically a fallout bunker fully stocked with years worth of dry food bottled water, medical supplies and along one wall a massive collection of firearms and ammunition. I shook my head in disbelief, “Thank God for rich paranoid veterans.” 

I stepped out onto the second story balcony, feeling altogether better about my situation for the time being. I supposed that if I had to be alone and forgotten, this would be the place to be. My thoughts were interrupted by a wretched and horrible howl that cut through the evening air. The three shepherds were still there outside the gate, but now they were focused on the tree line.  

Suddenly a lone female feral came limping out of the forest, moaning and howling in pain. She looked seriously injured; the shepherds took notice and started towards the injured creature, thinking it would be easy prey. Only, when they got only a few yards away they seemed to sense something, at least two of them did. The thinnest and most hungry of them carried on toward the feral while the others halted. In a sudden burst of motion, a dozen or more ferals rushed forwards from the forest. They pounced on the lone shepherd as the other two turned and ran before they could be caught. A chill ran up my spine as I watched the things that used to be people tear into the helpless dog. They had set a trap; the monsters could set traps.  

As I gazed across the fence at the horrible feast taking place, there came another howl from the woods. A deeper more familiar howl. The other ferals stopped eating and stepped back as the big bald feral came striding out of the trees. My heard pounded hard as I stared across the distance at him. He no longer wore the gray suite, as most of it had burned away when I locked him inside my burning house. His flesh looked charred in places, and I could still see the scar across his forehead that I had given in our first encounter. He howled again and the rest of the ferals retreated back into the woods. The big feral stared ahead, meeting my eyes for a solid minute. He then hefted the dog over his shoulder and retreated into the trees with the others.  

I found another set of locks in the basement and with trembling hands snapped them into place on the gate. Yes, I had found a paradise in the hellscape that was now the world. A small slice of paradise surrounded by monsters. But what do you call a paradise you can't leave? That you can't share? Is it still a paradise? Or is it a prison?
