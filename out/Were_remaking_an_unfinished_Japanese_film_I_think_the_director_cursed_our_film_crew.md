I just got off the phone with a Shinto spiritualist in Hawaii. I… don’t really know what to make of our conversation, but I think I’ll be flying there tomorrow morning. I just want to leave a record of everything that’s going on. I don’t know how much time I have left. I don’t know if *she* will let me leave.

My name is Zach. I’m a set production assistant (PA) for an independent film company in the United States. For those unfamiliar with film set hierarchies, production assistants are the lowest rung on the ladder. I do things like fetch water for my coworkers, take the trash out, set up tables, as well as any other miscellaneous tasks the director or other departments need me to do; basically, the ‘errand runners’ of the film industry. It’s not a bad job. It’s generally a gateway into getting hired for other departments on a film set, and you get a little glimpse of nearly every aspect of film production, even if you don't have a say creatively.

About four months ago, I got put on a project with a debut director; Peyton Tanner. Really generic name. I only really talked to the guy directly about three or four separate times. Despite him being a new director, he had plenty of creative direction experience in and around film. To him, this debut was his ‘first step’ at becoming an established director in Hollywood. I believed it. Although we were an indie company, we were a large one. He’d probably get a lot of attention from this, *if* the film was good.

He was generally very reclusive on set, and didn’t interact much with the people below the line— that was the job of the production coordinator or production manager. Usually, I would get tasks from our coordinator, a middle-aged Japanese man named Ken. He was a super nice guy, really understanding and knowledgeable about the industry. We got close over the course of the last few years, as I always seemed to be put on projects with him. He taught me a lot of practical things about the industry when I was a greenhorn.

A month into the shoot, the director took a break and went on vacation for a couple of weeks in rural Japan. It was highly unusual to do this in the middle of filming. I’ve heard from others that the guy had a bit of a tumultuous life. Bad relationships, drinking, drugs, and other vices. Someone close to him told me that it was one of those ‘find yourself’ journeys you’d hear about in self-help books and coming of age films. Apparently, he had taken a lot of these trips before, and came back with ‘new ideas’ and a ‘fresh perspective on life’. It’s just speculation, but I imagine this is probably where he got a lot of inspiration for his projects.

But Japan was different. Much different.

The original concept of the project was a horror film set in the northern, rural United States about a first generation migrant Japanese family struggling to acclimate to American culture. Being a former priest for a small, rural shrine in his hometown, the father continues to practice his spiritual beliefs in the United States. However, angrily, the spirits he once sought guidance and contentment from reject him, unleashing an evil spirit upon him instead, which torments his family and makes their struggle even more troublesome. In the end, he has to cast aside his Japanese customs and faith, in order to make the spirit lose power so he can finally defeat it.

It was… bad. And offensive, I thought. We had no Japanese cultural expertise on set, and the plot clearly took inspiration from antiquated ideas of assimilation and imperialism— the idea of having to ‘reject’ parts of your culture and heritage in order to live in the United States was destructive. At this point in the film industry, I feel that it was important to not spread poisonous messages like that to audiences. Although it was subtle about these overarching themes by presenting itself as a run of the mill horror experience, that was the gist of its themes. Ken kept neutral about his feelings towards the quality of the film, but his slight frowns when a particularly bad scene would be mentioned told a different story. Ken was a third-generation American, but he wasn’t ignorant to insensitivity to his culture, despite not really growing up around it. I really don’t know how it got the green light.

When the director got back from his trip to Japan, however, Peyton announced the script would be completely rewritten, at his discretion. On his two week trip, the director said he learned *so much* about Japanese culture, Shinto, shamanic practices and cleansing rituals and yada yada… But the best thing he discovered there, he said, was footage from an old, unfinished Japanese film. The movie we were making before, in his words, ‘was shit’ compared to the one we could make with this; a sentiment I largely agreed with. Anything was better than *that*, not that I really had much of a say anyway.

He was shown the footage from a *Kannushi*, which from what I understand is a sort of priest that oversees and maintains a shrine in Japan. The priest was kind enough to let Peyton make a copy. He had gotten close with this person over the course of his stay, and much of Peyton’s education on Shinto and Japanese culture was owed to this individual. You see, this rural priest was a bit of a film buff himself, as hard as that was to imagine— and happened to know a few amateur Japanese directors himself. These directors had a number of unfinished projects, one of which was going to be a horror film inspired by stories of a local *Yōkai*, or spirit, that haunted the forest surrounding the nearby mountain village Peyton was staying at. This Yōkai, Peyton told us, was called *Shukketsujō*. The bleeding woman. Peyton didn’t disclose why the film wasn’t finished, but I assumed that might be because he didn’t know himself.

The following two months after Peyton returned were hectic. The film’s new evolution involved an American family coming upon a Japanese cult in a mountain town, after recently migrating to rural Japan. It would also inherit the name of the unfinished Japanese film. An almost exact flip of the premise of our original concept. I was disappointed to hear this, as it carried almost the same issues as the original concept, and more. We were filming the movie as the script was being written, and the props and art department were swamped with completely new needs and creative direction. Not only that, but we were blasting through our old budget because of the sudden changes. Our assistant director and producer pleaded with Peyton to consult a cultural specialist, as some might find his depiction of Shinto beliefs and practices as insensitive, but he waved them off.

“I learned this stuff from an actual Shinto priest,” he would say. “I’ve been there. It’s the real deal. That trip educated me— who are you to say I’m wrong? Or depicting it unfairly? Have *you* ever gone? I’m as much of a cultural expert as you’re going to get. I’m depicting the gritty, dark underbelly of Japanese folklore, and it’s not always going to be pretty. This is an art, damnit. And I’m the artist.”

Although I didn’t pay it much mind back then, he had started saying a lot of weird things. I could only describe Peyton as becoming increasingly hysterical. He touted that we were making ‘the most accurate, dark, and realistic representation of Japanese occultism to ever exist,’ and yet he continuously changed significant details about how we were depicting the cultural rituals and practices in the film— to me, that’s a red flag that Peyton wasn’t basing this film off of what he had learned of Japanese culture on his trip, but instead basing it on his own whim. No one really understood what or why we were filming what we were, and the fact that Peyton was extremely protective of showing anyone the footage he was using for ‘inspiration’ was the nail in the coffin for the production. The company threatened to pull the plug; but Peyton managed to convince them to give him another two weeks to shoot one of the key scenes: ‘the ritual’. Then they could decide.

At this point, the father of the American family comes across a ritual, a human sacrifice, occurring at an old abandoned shrine near the top of a mountain, complete with a clear view of a starry night sky. The father realizes that this sacrifice is his own teenage daughter. We shot this scene in some hills in Montana. This was going to be the titular scene, where the Shukketsujō makes her first appearance. I’ve gotta say, the actress playing the Shukketsujō, Mai; She looked great as her. I fancied her a bit. Mai and I had gotten close over the course of filming. She was where I got most of my gossip about the cast members, and was an all-around pleasure to be with. She too, like Peyton, had her eyes set on Hollywood, although I could tell she was increasingly becoming disillusioned with Peyton’s downward spiral creatively. I think she had a real shot. Her look and demeanor in character— It was horrifying. The costumes and makeup department did a great job. She wore a pure white, floaty kimono, stained red from blood from the waist down, had unreasonably long arms, and sharp nails. Her face was pale, and her eyes were sunken, as if they were leading into a great black void. I was sure it would look even better in post-production. As she practiced her mannerisms and demeanor, I felt like I was being lulled into a trance, wanting to mindlessly wander towards her— even knowing as soon as I got to her, she would slice open my neck. It’s incredible how much feeling a great acting performance can elicit.

The ritual scene was set up like this: six priestesses, or *Miko*, as Peyton called them (although at this point, I wasn’t sure I should trust the authenticity of his depiction of this culture), were sat kneeling on both sides of a small, decrepit old wooden shrine; as the shaman approached the daughter with a dull, nicked hatchet. The shaman would chant something, and then the priestesses would slowly approach. As they surrounded the daughter, they would then stab her in the chest and abdomen with sharp knives. When a sufficient amount of blood was spilt, the shaman would then cut her head off, and sow a seed into the earth stained with blood to please the Shukketsujō, and bring good fortune. The father wouldn’t let this happen, of course; and interrupts the ritual— albeit a little too late. The daughter is stabbed, but lives. The Shukketsujō, angered at the botched ritual, makes its first appearance, slaughtering the cult while the father and daughter escape.

This event, happening near the midpoint of the movie, sets up the haunting of the Shukketsujō, who sought to finish what the cult started.

However, tragically, we never made it to that point.

I wasn’t there when it happened. It was usually the production assistant’s job to keep people off of set while the cameras were rolling, so I was at the bottom of the hill, where some of our crew was. That’s when we heard a series of gut wrenching screams. I was with one of my coworkers, Jeremiah— and we exchanged glances, as if to say: “What the fuck was that about?” We laughed a little about it immediately afterwards. We were filming a horror movie, after all. And the girl gets stabbed in this scene. It only made sense— except, they were followed by more screams, shouting, and commotion. This went on for a while this time, and we were concerned now, and started making our way up; but Ken met us first.

“Tell everyone to stay away from the set, and to start getting ready to leave.” He barked at us.

“What? What’s wrong? What’s going on up there?” I had asked back, curious as to what all of the commotion was.

“It’s the actress, Helen. She’s been stabbed— and then Peyton—”

“Stabbed? Oh god, is everyone okay?” My coworker interrupted.

“No, no. Listen— we called an ambulance and the police. Set security has it under control for now. Find the stragglers who haven’t gotten the message yet, and let them know too. I need you to help us bring supplies up for our on-site medic.”

Ken then ran past us, barely allowing us the time to process the information he had just given. Jeremiah made his way down towards the department tents we had set up in order to tell the others on-site, while I, ignoring Ken’s warning, continued upwards towards the film set.

The resulting scene was chaotic. The location we were at was remote, but still accessible by vehicle. Otherwise, it would have been almost impossible to set up the shoot within two weeks. That being said, it was far. It would take an ambulance at least forty-five minutes to arrive. Our medic had to do what they could until then. Helen was in bad shape. She was unresponsive. In her bloody clothes were several, distinct stab marks, as well as a large gash that tore vertically into her abdomen, her insides removed and pushed to the side of her body. The medic was frantically trying to patch her up quickly in the best way they could— but to me, it looked like it was in vain. I almost vomited looking at her. I looked away; instead taking the time to note the disorder of the commotion around me, only made more chaotic with poor visibility and dim lighting. Actors and actresses crying, some with arms covered in cuts and gashes. Crew members dashing down the hill and back, making sure everyone is accounted for, and tending to the less severely wounded. A few security guards, one of which also looked injured, surrounded a post near the shrine, with a subdued, handcuffed Peyton. He was screaming the same thing, over and over.

“For her! For her! For her!”

A few people were struggling to climb down the opposite side of the hill, near the makeshift shrine. A pained wailing could be heard from below. It sounded to me like someone had tumbled down the side of the hill. I hoped to god they were okay. My processing of the scene around me was then interrupted by a stern and irate Ken, an understandable, yet significant departure from his usual demeanor.

“Zach! What the fuck are you doing? I need you to bring up supplies from our medical tent! Go, go! Quickly!” He screamed at me. I managed a quick apology, and quickly ran to do what he said.

It was overwhelming. Ken aggressively barked orders at the other PA’s, who obliged with as much speed and precision as they could muster. Our experience as the backbone and lifeblood of a film crew translated hauntingly efficiently into damage control and disaster relief; bandaging the injured, making sure everyone was hydrated, getting blankets for those more immediately affected by witnessing the violence that had just taken place. After a while, I stopped trying to process the events that had occurred, as my legs and arms moved on their own, accomplishing each task on autopilot.

When those red and blue sirens appeared in the distance, I felt relief. Every emotion hit me all at once. I sat on the ground and cried. Worked into the ground, overwhelmed by the reasonless violence and tragedy that had just occurred. I couldn’t stop theorizing about what happened— it was clear that the director, Peyton, had something to do with it. But how could such a thing happen when the cameras were rolling? While there were so many people there?

After the authorities took control of the set, I would get my answer. Ken came to me with a blanket, and warm water. I felt the heated liquid flow down my esophagus and warm my stomach, temporarily easing the stress and trauma I had just been exposed to. I thanked him, and he sat beside me. Despite how he took control of the situation and mobilized everyone to help, I could just now see that Ken was just as affected by this as everyone else was. His eyes looked down at the floor, and he put his hands on his head. In doing so, I noticed a bloody, makeshift bandage on his arm. He had gotten hurt as well, after all. After sitting there a while like that, he surprised me by apologizing. He apologized for making me— no, that’s not quite right. Not specifically me. He apologized for making his team run damage control in the aftermath of a heinous and violent tragedy. For putting us through that. We ‘weren’t soldiers, nor medics, nor humanitarians’ he said. I patted his back wordlessly. I didn’t know if anything I could say would ease the guilt Ken was feeling. After a while, sitting there, I asked him what he knew about what happened. He said he saw everything.

While shooting, Peyton had continuously exclaimed that the scene wasn’t scary enough. It wasn’t as impactful, as *visceral* as it needed to be. He flipped from letting the daughter live, to letting the daughter die, for about a dozen takes; also demanding slight changes to the costumes and set. He changed the words that the shaman chanted. He wanted the knives redesigned, the hatchet redesigned. He wanted the *Miko* to speak, to not speak. In his frustration, he eventually ran off into the forest for about fifteen minutes to consult with the footage he had gotten from Japan. When he came back, everyone prepared to shoot the scene again. Rather than stabbing the daughter all at once, the *Miko* would stab her one at a time. With that change, they started rolling.

In filmmaking, some studios used ‘retractable prop knives’ in order to show stabbings. We were no different. Except— Peyton had replaced one of the prop knives with a real one. When one of the actresses, Julia, went up to thrust the knife into Helen’s heart, she was actually stabbed. Luckily, Julia noticed in time for the wound to not be so deep; but even then, Helen cried out in pain— “I’m hurt, oh god, I’m hurt.” She said, faintly.

Our producer called for a medic, which was followed by some of our personnel scrambling to help her. Then, in the commotion, Peyton ran onto the set. Others assumed he was trying to help, and let him be. They didn’t see the knife he pulled out. He attacked the dazed Julia, causing deep gashes in her left and right arms, and ultimately pushing her onto the floor. He then climbed on top of Helen, who was screaming and kicking at him— calling for any strength she could muster to resist. Strength that she did not have.

Peyton must have stabbed her a dozen times until people finally understood what was going on. Cast and crew members screamed, some ran. But most simply watched, stunned, as Helen’s screams slowly faded as she lost consciousness.

“For. Her! For. Her! For. Her!” Peyton yelled out amidst a silent, shocked crowd as he repeatedly stabbed Helen, already unresponsive.

He took his knife and dragged it across her abdomen, opening her up. He reached inside with his other hand, disemboweling her, and threw her insides off to the side. Blood from Helen’s other wounds pooled inside of her freshly opened stomach cavity. Laughing maniacally, he then procured a small seed from his pocket, and placed it neatly inside of her.

“For her! For her! For her! A bleeding seed for her to grow!”

After what seemed like ages, witnessing the heinous, violent act finally sparked action into the idle crowd. Some members of the film crew and cast ran at him to pull him away from Helen; but he wildly swung his arm around, slashing and slicing those around him with reckless abandon, making it difficult to approach. Some people tried to talk him down, but he just kept repeating the same line, over and over, as he continued his rampage, attempting to stab and slash anyone who dared to get close. Peyton’s attention then suddenly veered towards Mai, who watched horrified at the acts she had just witnessed. The crazed director rushed her. Mai tried to run, but her costume as the Shukketsujō limited her greatly; the most she could do was stumble backwards as the man quickly closed the distance, plunging his dagger deep into her abdomen and pushing her down the opposite end of the hill. She managed a surprised, gut-wrenching scream, as she tumbled to the bottom. It was then that one of our security guards was able to tackle him to the ground, subduing him while enduring an onslaught of knife swings— after which, two other members of our security detail managed to get Peyton handcuffed to the side of the shrine.

Before that day, I had only seen acts of violence like that in movies. Sometimes they were even scenes I’ve worked on or around. But to see the reality of such gruesome, inhuman attack; to witness it in person— it was nothing short of debilitatingly traumatic. Even then, I was one of the lucky ones. I only saw the aftermath. It must be hell for those who had seen it firsthand. When the EMT’s arrived, I tried in vain to ride with Mai to the hospital. I think somewhere deep down, I knew she wouldn’t survive. I saw her when they pulled her from the bottom of that hill. Her figure was broken, and twisted. Bruises and blood covered her body and clothes. She screamed and screamed, consciously enduring unbearable pain. The last time I had ever seen her. She succumbed to her wounds in transit, after an excruciating fifty-one minutes waiting at the bottom of that hill. Her final words to me ringed in my ears:

“I’m hoping for a nice, quick shoot Zach. One more step towards finishing this shitty movie.”

It was depressingly anticlimactic. Unknowing of the tragedy about to occur. Nothing that remotely gave me a sense of closure. Just a meaningless jab at a role that Mai was increasingly cynical with. I wished it was different. I wished I had tried a little harder, maybe gotten to know her a bit better. And then, maybe, those final words may have been different. They may have meant something.

The story hit local news quickly, giving a lackluster summary of the awful, life-changing tragedy that had occurred.

“Two dead, dozens injured in film shoot stabbings.”

I remember scoffing at the oversimplification of the events the next morning at a Motel 6 near the shoot location that a few of my coworkers were also staying at. I got a knock on my door then, a lawyer representing the film company we worked under. He wanted us to sign an NDA about the murders, until Peyton’s trial was concluded. I think this was a way to keep the news from becoming national. I thought it was selfish, manipulative, and in poor taste, but I signed it anyway. I just wanted to put everything behind me.

Then, the murders started.

The project was canceled at this point. Everyone who was working on the film were given hefty monetary compensation and a paid month off. Probably another way for the film company to keep our mouths shut. I didn’t mind, though. I needed the time to decompress. The trauma from that day was difficult to cope with at first, but I was slowly learning to get by. Slowly getting back into the routine of normal, daily life.

I was lounging on the couch at home, when I changed the TV channel to the news. I sat shocked at the bright headline I saw in front of me.

“Actress connected to film set murder in Montana murdered in her home.”

Feeling an onslaught of anxiousness and panic, I hurriedly turned off the TV. I reached for my phone, my finger hovering a familiar name. I called it.

“Hey. I guess you just saw the news.” Ken said, his voice notably shaking.

“Yeah, I saw. After everything— it’s so tragic. Who was it? What happened?” I replied, with faux calmness, attempting to hide mounting fear.

“It was uh…” He paused, clearly distressed. “It was Julia. She was already struggling with her mental health after everything. Even so— she was getting better. God, this is too cruel. To be killed like that…” He trailed off.

“I’m the one who found her. I was just checking up on her this morning, since I hadn’t heard anything from her in a while.”  His words stung. Everyone had been through enough already, seen enough already.

“She was… skinned alive. Flayed. Sick son of a bitch hung her up in the foyer, nailed to the wall, a rope around her waist— It was horrible, Zach. Just horrible.” He said. “It looked like a fucking offering. And they told me they couldn’t find any evidence of a break-in or anything. And you’d think after injuries so violent that there would be blood everywhere— well, there wasn’t. Only pooled beneath her. Like everything had happened in a single instant. I couldn’t help but vomit at the sight of her.” Ken started sobbing.

I didn’t know what to say. Or if I *could* say anything that would give any semblance of comfort. So I stayed silent.

“Zach…” He paused, as if contemplating whether or not he should continue. “Something is happening. I haven’t heard from a couple of the others in a while, either. I’m worried— I keep seeing things. A glimpse of a flowing white cloth speeding around a corner. Shadows in the corners of my eye. And now, this?”  His voice quivered.

“I… did a bit of research. Into the village that Peyton visited. And into the mythology surrounding the Yōkai we were basing the film off of.” He paused for a moment, and calmly took in a deep breath.

“He never showed anyone that footage he brought back from Japan, did he?” He asked quizzically, as if being cross-examined by a renowned prosecutor.

“No, not that I heard.” He was always so protective of it. Whenever someone would ask, he would shut them down immediately and shoo them off. After everything that happened, it must have been some real fucked up shit.

“Listen, I was talking to our assistant producer, Emilia, and she felt really weird about how he was acting while we were shooting. I mean, no one even knew where he kept it.” I could feel the nervousness in his voice through the phone. “Recently, she was able to get in touch with a translator that accompanied Peyton to Japan. A fellow he met online that lived in the Shimane prefecture, where Peyton was going to stay.”

“Okay…” I wondered where this tangent was going to lead.

“Well, it turns out that Peyton wasn’t completely honest with his retelling of his vacation.”  Ken sighed. “I’d… really rather talk to you in person about this. Can we meet up for lunch or something in a couple of days?”

“Yeah, of course. How about that café everyone used to frequent after shoots?” I felt like something familiar might ease Ken’s stress.

“Yeah, yeah. That sounds good. I’ll see you.”

“See you.”

It was clear to me that Ken was stressed and understandably on-edge after witnessing two gruesome and heinous crimes firsthand within such a short amount of time. I would help talk him into therapy, maybe. No one person should have to endure such a thing without professional help. The stuff he was experiencing wasn’t unheard of for the amount of trauma he had been through.

In the time before meeting Ken, there were two more murders. One cast member of the film production and our camera technician. Both in the same manner as Julia. It was an agonizingly slow two days. My fear was beginning to mount. It was clear someone was targeting the cast and crew of *Shukketsujō*. One question lingered in my mind— would I be next?

It was a cold, stormy day when I met Ken at the café. He looked like shit. His hair and beard were disheveled and unkempt, dark circles surrounded his eyes, and he looked pale and weak. He sat hunched over his hot coffee at the table, and it seemed as if the slightest touch would make him keel over. He wore a bright red hoodie, drenched in rain, and as I approached him, I noticed water had pooled on the floor under his feet.

“Hey, Ken.” As I greeted him, he shot up with surprise.

“Oh, ha. Hey Zach.” He was awkward, and stumbled over his words.

“Did you walk here or something? You’re drenched.” I stared at the puddle of water below him.

“Yeah, yeah I did.” His eyes avoided mine, as if he were embarrassed.

“Don’t you have a car?” If I remember the area that Ken lived in, it was at least a thirty-minute walk to the café.

“Well, yeah— but I uh, don’t really drive if I don’t have to.” He turned his head away from me as I sat across from him. I had a feeling that this was a somewhat recent development.

“It’s fine, really. I’ve gotta get some more exercise nowadays anyway.” He managed a slight smile, though his attempt at reassurance fell short. I returned a concerned look.

“Tell me what’s going on, Ken.”

“Well, uh. The footage. The footage that Peyton said he got from Japan. They didn’t find it anywhere. People are beginning to think that there never was any at all. That, or he hid it really well. And…” A sigh escaped his mouth. “If we had just pressed him further. Seen the signs that he went off the deep end— we might’ve been able to prevent all of this.”

His words weren’t unfamiliar. I had told myself that too. Thinking that if only I had spoken up about Peyton’s strange behavior, things may have gone differently. I knew that lingering on that fact wasn’t going to help, but…

“So there never was any footage at all then? We were just operating on Peyton’s whim?”

“We were always operating on his whim. That’s hardly a surprise. What *is* a surprise is that he was so adamant about hiding something that didn’t exist. Not only that, but the translator said that Peyton apparently never met a *Kannushi*. The town he was staying at didn’t have a local shrine; at least not one in use. The residents there usually went to a neighboring village.”

I gave him a puzzled, curious look.

“That’s not even the strangest part, Zach. He made the translator and a woman he had met from the village hike up the side of a mountain one day. There was an abandoned shrine up there, maybe more than a century old, the translator said. Despite being generally knowledgeable of the area, the translator had no idea it was there. Peyton made the woman film him by that shrine, Zach. He… recorded something up there.”

“So there *was* footage?”

“Well, I don’t know if it was ever saved or anything. Like I said, it hasn’t been found. This is just based on what the translator said.”

“What did he do then?”

“He had a live chicken with him. He sliced its head off with a knife, and planted a seed in its esophagus as it bled. Sound familiar? I think he cursed us somehow. Cursed our film, or film crew, when he did that. Upset something.”

“What, so you think he made some cursed film? This isn’t *The Ring*, Ken. This was a heinous act by a psycho. All this does is confirm that.”

“No, Zach. This is real. No human could do that to Julia. This made me do some research on Japanese folklore— on Yōkai. I thought, Peyton must have messed something up. Angered some Yōkai of the forest, or something.”

“Listen to yourself, Ken. You’ve been through a lot. I understand how that must make you feel, but this is ridiculou—”

“No, no! Listen, Zach.” He raised his voice, eliciting a few stares from the customers nearby. Embarrassed, he shrunk back into his seat, and spoke softly.

“Peyton kept saying ‘For her! For her!’ over and over. This was an offering to someone, *something*. And I think that something is coming for us, now. I can feel her. I think… I think I may be next. But…”

“But what?”

“Just, Emilia told me something that Peyton told her. Something about the *Shukketsujō* when we were filming. He told her that she wanted to spread the blood.” Ken looked… uncomfortable, speaking about this in particular. His body language was difficult to read.

“Spread the blood?” I looked at him with a raised eyebrow.

“I—It’s nothing. I just kept wondering what that meant, is all.” His eyes actively avoided mine while he nervously rubbed his hands together. I felt there was more to this, but I didn’t want to press him any further. I think he was already at his limit, and cold, too. He was shivering, soaked from the rain outside. I figured now was as good a time as anything to get him home.

“Hey, look, Ken. I believe you. I think right now though, you need to give yourself a break. You’ve been through a whole bunch. You need a rest.”

“Y-yeah. I guess you’re right.” He let out a deep sigh.

“Come on, I’ll take you home.” I offered.

“No, no. I couldn’t. I live out of the way.” His leg bounced up and down. He was nervous about something.

“I’m not gonna let you walk home in the rain, man. It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.” I wasn’t really going to take no for an answer while he was in the state he was in. I wanted to make sure he got home safe.

He sat still for what seemed like just a second too long, contemplating my offer. Eventually, he stood up and nodded his head wordlessly, following close behind me as we left the cafe.

I have to admit, it was strange having someone about a decade my senior be so vulnerable to me. I was happy to be someone that Ken could confide in, though. He had, for the majority of my career in this field, been my greatest mentor. I thought it was the least I could do for him.

As I hurriedly walked across the rain-drenched streets to my beat-up ‘02 Corolla Sedan, I noticed Ken had been lingering on the sidewalk. He was fiddling with something in his pocket. Not wanting to get drenched, I called out to him, slightly annoyed.

“Ken, come on man. The rain is getting worse.”

“S—sorry.” I could barely hear him mutter as the storm started to pick up, obfuscating my vision and filling my eardrums with the constant *pat pat* of raindrops against the concrete. Despite my call to him, he hesitated before he began to cross the street to get to me; his eyes glued to the ground below him.

“Ken?” He closed the distance between us slowly, methodically. I began to worry.

“I’m sorry, Zach. I just— I needed more time. More time to prepare. I—I can feel her. She wants me to spread her blood, just like Peyton. I—If I do that, I think she might spare me, or give me more time. I think that’s what Peyton was doing. Time spent in prison is better than no time at all, right?” His words were nonsensical to me. It would take more than a moment to realize what he meant by them.

As he approached, I noticed the front pocket on his red hoodie was dripping. Not soaked with water, no. A deep red liquid was quickly being washed away by the heavy rain, falling onto the asphalt below. I stood paralyzed next to my car, unable to process what was occurring. He removed his hands from his hoodie pocket to reveal a bloody hand, covered in self-inflicted cuts and gashes, bleeding profusely. In his other hand, something metal, and shiny; obscured by the thick blanket of rain.

“When Peyton slashed me, he marked me, Zach. With her blood. Everyone who was injured that day was. Marked with her blood. Marked for death. Now, I need to mark you, Zach. For her.”

Spotting the knife in his hand snapped me out of the trance I had been in. I quickly ran towards the door of my vehicle, but Ken was too quick. He lunged towards me, grabbing me and throwing me behind him. I hit the asphalt hard— but otherwise uninjured. I shot up as fast as I could; just in time to grab Ken’s hand and fight him for control over the knife. He swung it wildly, nicking my face and arms with small cuts, but I had finally wrested control of his wrists. I threw my shoulder into his chest, which sent him into the side of my vehicle, dropping the bloody knife. He sat there a moment, a defeated, sad look in his eyes.

“I’m sorry Zach.” He said with short breaths. “I’ve done it. Your blood is tainted too. Now, she’ll come for you, instead of me.” He began to break down, crying, curled up next to my car.

I looked at the cuts he had inflicted on me. Shallow, but painful. Just barely enough to draw blood. I didn’t believe what he was saying, at first. I stared down at him, disgusted, as he lay there in the rain. I didn’t say a damn thing. I was hurt. My mentor, and my friend— pushed to violence, unable to reconcile the contents of his mind. He sat wordlessly as I called the police; only managing a sad, regretful glance at me as they took him away.

After the police were done questioning me, I was free to go home. Though about an hour had passed, the rain hadn’t let up. It was a cold and isolating drive back to my house. It gave me a lot to think about. Given how much Ken had been through, I could only assume that he had been subject to the same manic hysteria that Peyton had. The whole situation still stung— but I needed to get home, to rest.

Outside my home, I glanced behind me at my car. Streaks of blood stemming from a bloody handprint lay on the driver side door, slowly being washed away by the heavy rain. I thought it was strange that I hadn’t noticed it until now; but I suppose Ken had left it when I threw him into the side of the car. Even still, it should have been gone by now. It looked… *recent*, like the constant downpour had just started to clear it away. Despite wanting to get inside as soon as possible, something compelled me to get closer to inspect it. As the rain washed the blood off of my car, I watched the blood-stained water stream into a puddle at the front of my driveway. In that puddle, I…

Well, I think I saw *her*.

I remember the image clearly. Behind me, in the reflection, was a woman dressed in a white kimono spotted with blood. Her face and body were skinless, but her blood flowed heavily; as if she were a flayed rabbit hung upside-down to drain. There were dark, blank voids where eyes should be— and she lacked a mouth. I nearly screamed; falling backwards into the rain, scrambling to face the horror that had ambushed me from behind.

But, of course, there was nothing there at all.

I felt that maybe, like Ken, this was all getting to me just a bit too much.

Then, I would see her again. In the bathroom mirror. Behind a lamppost outside. A flash of white in the corner of my eyes.

When I slept, I would dream I was skinless. Nailed to the wall, bled dry. A part of some sick ritual to please a ghost.

Worse, when I was awake, Ken’s words consumed me: ‘Spread the blood’ he had said. He… I think he was trying to escape her. I feared that I might have to do the same thing he did.

“Actor, producer found dead in their homes this evening; connected to string of murders”

The murders continued. Same way, every time. Flayed. Hung up with nails. Rope around their waist.

As more and more people who worked on *Shukketsujō* were murdered, her presence strengthened. I saw her more frequently. I had more vivid nightmares. Sometimes, these nightmares would bleed into reality. I saw the Shukketsujō puppeteering the bloody, broken bodies of Helen and Mai with threads, hovering above them. They would approach me with sharp knives, and stab me to death; peeling my skin.

I… started feeling the urge to do the same to others.

Out of options, I started researching Shinto, consulting with as many specialists as I could. I landed on a *Kannushi* from Hawaii, a man named Nozomi, at the Izumo Taishakyo shrine— this shrine was based on a famous one in Japan called the Izumo-Taisha, in the Shimane prefecture. This was the same prefecture that Peyton had visited.

When I explained my situation to Nozomi, he cited a famous story of the *Kami*, or deity, that the Izumo-Taisha was dedicated to: Ōkuninushi. The Hare of Inaba. The story of a flayed hare, in constant pain and suffering— submitted to even more suffering by Ōkuninushi’s brothers.

Nozomi told me that *Kami* could be born of anything. Of other *Kami*, of the elements. Of feelings. Of pain. Of blood.

What we were dealing with was not a Yōkai. It was a vengeful *Kami*, borne from the pain and suffering of the Hare of Inaba. An obscure, little-known goddess. The goddess that bleeds to death. The *Shukketsu-shijō*.

He told me to come to Hawaii, so I may cleanse myself with *Harae*, or a ritual purification, a common practice in Shinto. After that, he recommended I go to the same abandoned shrine that Peyton visited, to properly commune.

It’s just… I keep sliding my finger across my kitchen knives, and watching the blood drip. I don’t know how much longer I can resist her.

I think— before my flight, I’ll pay that café a visit again. *For her*.
