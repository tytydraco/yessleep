Four months ago, I achieved something every entomologist dreams of: I discovered a new type of insect. Not just a new species, but an entirely new family of hymenoptera. I’m not writing this to brag. This is not a dissertation, or some grand scientific paper. I’ve been assured local officials have been informed, so you can read all about the biology of these things whenever their experts publish something. I will not be taking part in those studies. Just typing now, remembering them, is making me sweat and shake. But I have to get this down. If only to prove to myself that it’s real.

A few months back, my team received a grant for a field study. An invasive species of locusts had been wreaking havoc on a corporate farm, and we were tasked with finding a means of halting their spread. General pesticides had proven ineffective, so the goal had become to slow their reproduction. The dispatched group consisted of myself, my husband Ian, and our junior researcher, Muhammed.

We were transferred from the airport to their facility via helicopter. A picturesque sunset washed over the endless plains with an orange glow. A soft breeze rustled through the tall grass, appearing as a sea of grain. It was Muhammed’s first time riding in a chopper, and his excitement was contagious.

“CAN YOU BELIEVE WE GET PAID TO DO THIS?!”

I flinched at his shouting as it erupted through my headset.

“You don’t have to yell, Med, the mic works perfectly fine.”

“Sorry, Becca. It’s weird to get used to.” He didn’t even glance in my direction, the scenery proving too captivating to look away from.

“Don’t blame him for getting excited,” Ian chirped, nudging at me. “How could you not when we’re in a HELICOPTER!”

I recoiled at the volume again, as did Muhammed.

“Oh shit,” he mumbled. “Is that what I sound like?”

Ian’s boisterous laugh came through the headset, a mix of elation and mischief.

“No,” I retorted. “You’re much less annoying.”

That brief interaction should have been savored for what it was. We had no way of knowing it would be the last normal conversation we would ever share. But it vanished as quickly as it took Muhammed to look back out of the window.

“Wait,” he said. “Was it always doing that?”

He pointed to the top of the glass. Small bursts of smoke shot into view before dissipating in the wind. We shared a look of concern before the pilot’s voice rang over our channel.

“THE ROTOR IS MALFUNCTIONING! BUCKLE UP BACK THERE! IT’S ABOUT TO GET BUMPY!”

We were already strapped into our seatbelts, but Muhammed grabbed tight onto any railing he could wrap our fingers around. Ian and I grabbed each other. The cabin began shaking, lightly at first, but quickly grew to a nauseating rhythm. It felt like each vibration knocked another screw loose. More smoke flooded the window, and I felt my stomach seize as the helicopter began to lose altitude.

“WE’RE GOING DOWN!” 

The pilot was screaming over the mic. He sounded as panicked as we were. I’m not ashamed to say I was crying. Muhammed was yelling louder with every inch of descent. Ian, the beautiful, perfect man he was, stroked my hair. I heard him shout “I love y-” before the crunch of impact, and I lost consciousness.

When I came to, I was still strapped in the chair. I felt warm, metallic liquid, and hands smearing it across my face. The inside of my head both sounded and felt like a church bell. I smelled the industrial rot of burning metal, and my eyes shot open as my brain caught up to my body. The neon red emergency lights blended with the soft glow of dusk through a haze of mechanical smoke. I was freed from shock by the two hands on my face. They pulled my attention forward, and made me focus on Ian’s face.

“Beck! You’re okay baby! Tell me you’re ok!” My head leaned forward into his palms and shot back up as the adrenaline stabbed my senses to full alert. I felt the blood on my face as clearly as I tasted it. My neck felt tight, like the vertebrae were trying to escape, but I was alive, and so was he.

“Ian? Where…what happe-” 

I heard the deepest sigh of relief escape his lips. Only matched by the one I’d heard when I told him I loved him back. 

“Shh, it’s okay, baby. You’re okay, we’re okay.”

“I’m okay too, asshole.”

Muhammed was slumped on the door of the cabin, a makeshift sling tying his left arm into place. His unwavering grin was gone, replaced by a mixture of anguish and fear. I tried to stand up against the harness, and ripped what was left of it out of its fastenings. I listed for a moment but caught myself before I could fall.

“What…what about the pilot?”

“We h-haven’t checked yet,” Ian stammered through difficult breaths. “You were only out for a minute.”

I grasped the handles of the door and yanked, but scrap metal and burnt wires were sealing us inside. I didn’t see any fire, but I felt the temperature climbing. I looked over to Ian, who had helped Muhammed to his feet. 

“Ian, the door!” I shouted. 

He leaned Med onto the seat next to them, and wrapped his hands under mine. We pried it open with several ear grinding scrapes.

I was too eager to get out of the cabin. Overestimating my physical state, I hopped to the ground. My legs felt nonexistent, and they buckled beneath me. I hit the dirt. Hard.

“FUCK!” I hollered. 

“Becca! You alright?”

“Fine.” I croaked. “The ground wasn’t where I thought it’d be.”

Armed with the knowledge of my idiocy, he climbed slowly down the side. He took my hands in his and asked if I could stand. I told him I could, and he hoisted me up faster than I expected, somehow making the ringing in my ears worse.

Muhammed was next. We both guided his body down as he struggled with one arm, grunting with every step he took. When his boots hit the ground, we each took a few steps back and finally saw the complete state of our would-be chariot, as well as its pilot.

It was impossible to tell if the impact had killed him, the fire, or the glass shards embedded into his body. The windshield was entirely blasted away. Soot had caked itself across the exterior, and stones of all sizes were buried into the metal. It was a sight I couldn’t stomach. I fell to my knees and threw up. It splashed my hands, and caked smoldering earth across my skin. Muhammed didn’t feint, but the view had taken his legs as it had taken mine, and he fell back on his ass with a pained groan.

Ian joined the two of us on the ground. Once my stomach was finished turning itself inside out, I sat back, and fully took in the wreckage. It was a heaping, smoking thing that barely resembled what had taken off. Flames encased the cockpit and spat from the top. The blades had been completely torn off, and it was mangled all the way to the tail, which had snapped off and planted itself a few dozen yards ahead of the impact. I realized we were sitting in the long crater it had plowed into the earth, thirty-something feet long and deep enough that I couldn’t see out from my hunched state. At the time I remember wishing I could thank the pilot for whatever emergency landing he had used to save our lives. But now, knowing what surviving would cost us, I wish I could’ve killed him myself. 

I shook my legs to make sure they would work this time, and got them underneath me to check out where we landed. The sun had fully set about a half hour before,  but through the dimming purples and oranges in the sky, I could see a faint light illuminating the direction we had been flying in.

“That way.” I pointed. “The farms we were headed to are massive. If we can just get to the outskirts, we can probably find somebody to help us.”

“We were still about a half hour out.” Ian chimed. “That’s a couple of hours of walking, and it’ll be too dark to see soon. We have to find some kind of shelter until-”

he stopped mid sentence when he saw my face again.

“Baby, I’m so sorry, I forgot you were bleeding.” He had also forgotten the blood tricking down his own leg. 

“Really? I hadn’t noticed.”

He put his hands on my shoulders, and I could tell he was starting to work himself into a panic.

“Are you okay? Does it hurt? Where does it hurt?”

“I’m fine, Ian. I think the blood’s stopped, at least from my head.”

“I remember seeing a medical kit next to my seat. I’ll be right-”

I firmly grabbed his shoulder.

“The helicopter is on fire Ian. I’m not letting you fry yourself to treat a scrape. You, however,” I gestured to his leg. “You definitely need something. Start with pressure, I’ll see if I can get a piece of fabric ripped off.”

I heard a “heads up” whistle from behind me, and turned just in time to catch the backpack Muhammed tossed from the ground.

“I always bring bandages, Becca. It’s literally in my job description.” Muhammed was beaming, clearly happy to be helpful.

“You’re getting a raise, Med.” I said over my shoulder, wasting no time in wrapping the cut on Ian’s leg.

“And it’s not even my birthday,” he chuckled under his breath. 

Muhammed had made it to his feet and trudged his way out of the trench. He took a moment surveying the land before he looked back at me.

“Becca, what would it take to get yet another raise?”

“Maybe if you have a jeep somewhere in this pack.”

“What about some promising shelter?”

I gave one final tug to tighten Ian’s bandages, and stood up at the word. I didn’t respond, instead climbing to reach his level. Sure enough, a smooth mound of rocks was peaking over the surrounding brush, a wide mouth carving a promising entrance. I put my arm around Med’s shoulder and patted his chest.

“I’ll see what I can do.”

I placed Ian’s arm over my shoulder. A few minutes passed, and we were sitting on the cold stone floor. The fading shock left us more sore by the minute. My head throbbed with a dull pain, I know now that it was a concussion. Muhammed felt like his arm was going to fall off, a worry he relayed every few steps, but Ian had it the worst. The cut on his leg had reached deep. I didn’t see bone when I applied the bandages, but the blood hadn’t stopped, and was pushed through his wraps with every limping step.

Despite my own pain, I sat upright and rested Ian’s head on my lap. At this point, Muhammed was lit more by the stars behind him than the faded sunlight. He sat himself at the mouth of the cave and looked out cautiously into growing night

“Becca?” He asked.

“Yeah.”

“There should be a flashlight and a lighter in the front right pocket of my bag. I’ll grab some grass, you take the flashlight and grab any wood you can find. It’s gonna get fairly cold, and we can’t be half frozen for the walk tomorrow. Plus, we don’t know the fauna of the region. Might be helpful to keep them at bay.”

“...Okay,” I huffed. It was all I could manage. I removed the flashlight from his bag, kissed Ian’s forehead, and trudged my way out.

It took a while, but I put together enough wood to hope it’d burn through the night. When I got back, Muhammed had formed a solid base of grass.

“Took you long enough.” He jeered.

Even with the light pointing away from him, I could sense the sarcastic smile on his face.

“I was beginning to think we’d have an uncomfortable cave floor sleepover.” Ian joined in, his voice regaining the charm I was concerned would drain out of his leg.

“It’s not the floor, we’re outside. This is what’s known as the ground.” I began structuring the broken branches and bark over the brush.

“Is it though?” Muhammed retorted. “Once we’re in a cave, are we technically inside? This was the original inside if you think about it.”

I took my seat away from the fire and pointed the light directly into his eyes.

“Light the fire lighter boy, or no raise..”

The talking ended, the fire caught, and we felt okay for the first time since we crashed. At least I did. No telling what the other two were thinking. After a few minutes of silence Ian was already asleep. My attention had settled on the stars outside, hoping they wouldn’t be the last I ever saw. Muhammed, however, broke the silence with a whisper.

“Becca? Do you see that?”

I snapped to attention and turned towards him.

“See what?”

He was staring deeper into the cavern.

“I don’t know. I just need to know if you can see it too.”

I followed his gaze, and only saw darkness. After a few seconds to let my eyes adjust, I caught it. A hint of flickering light, reflections of the fire. It looked like a dozen tiny mirrors were gently swaying in and out of view, their full form hidden just outside of our camp’s light.

I stood up a little too quickly, and my head throbbed with pain again. “Yeah, Med,” I rubbed my forehead. “I see it. I thought you had checked out the rest of the cave.”

“With what light flashlight girl? You’d have me stumble around with a lighter while Ian bled out by himself?”

“Jesus, I get it. Could you just watch him again? I can check it out.”

“Yell if you need anything.”

I gave him a barely illuminated thumbs up before slowly stepping through the jagged rocks that cut deeper into our shelter. The closer I got to the glistening image, the more confused I became. The flashlight’s beam allowed me to see a clear hole in the innermost wall, about three feet wide. It looked like the walls inside this hole were covered in scales at first. The motion I had mistook for swaying was more of a folding and fluttering, as if the cave itself was trying to shed its interior lining. What initially seemed to be orange in the glow of our flame, transformed into an iridescent mix of blue, purple, and green in the white light of my torch. I knew even before I saw clearly into the hole. We were camped right outside of a hive.

The cavern inside the hole was huge, maybe twenty by twenty feet, and every square centimeter was occupied by a pearlescent exoskeleton. They didn’t react to the light, nor my footsteps as I approached, entranced by this alien sight. 

I’ve been obsessed with insects since I was a child. I dedicated grade school, under and post grad, and a doctoral degree on their study. These things were different from any species I had ever come across, even just researching. The closest bug I can think of to their appearance would be a tarantula hawk wasp, for their size, shape, and stinger, but that doesn’t paint a perfect picture.

Tarantula hawk wasps have a subtle teal coloring, only appearing at specific angles of observation. These practically shimmered in the sodium light, as if an aurora was captured inside each carapace. Their wings set them apart as well. Where most wasps and other hymenopterans have thin wings that rest along their back, theirs jutted straight out on either side of the thorax, more akin to the shape and color of a violet dropwing. They either sat motionless, or lightly brushed over their neighbors, refracting light across the room in uneven shutters. Lastly, wasps of this size are usually solitary. They hunt and nest on their own, raise young, and die. Whatever species this was, there must have been hundreds, if not thousands lining the walls beyond the hole.

I instantly recognized the potential of what I was looking at. A new class of insect sat dormant less than ten feet from me. I slowly backed away, and almost skipped back to Muhammed.

“Med!” I whispered too loudly, unable to contain my excitement. “There’s something in there! Maybe a new species of wasp or fly, but it’s incredible!”

He immediately sat up from his slouched position against a large rock. 

“If you’re lying, it’s not funny and you’re a bad person.”

“Take the flashlight and check it out for yourself. Just be quiet. I think they’re sleeping, and as pretty as they are, they look mean.”

“Roger. Look after your man while I check it out.”

As Muhammed followed my path, I woke Ian with the excitement of a child waking her parents on Christmas morning.

“Ian! Baby, wake up. There’s a nest of some kind in here! A brand new species! I think they might be wasps of some kind, but their biology is almost completely foreign to other hymenoptera.”

He looked up half awake, his eyes slowly widening with each word.

“Ian, this could be an entirely new evolutionary line! I’ve never seen anything like it!”

“Becca…that’s incredible,” he said weakly. “Where’s Muha-” 

He was cut off before he could ask. Muhammed’s voice cut through the quiet night with a sharp, terrified scream. A scream that was almost immediately drowned out by a cacophony of buzzing, beating wings, and clambering mandibles.

I only had enough time to see a glistening cloud of chitin hurtling towards Ian and me. My body moved on instinct and fell on top of my husband in a hopeless effort to shield him. They were instantly upon us. Thousands of sharp legs, those beautiful wings beating across my body. The buzz was so loud, I felt like I was going to drown in it. I couldn’t hear Ian or myself, no matter how loud we yelled. I felt him writhing beneath me, mixed with the feeling of every crawling thing that slid between us. It was too overwhelming to focus on any one sensation. All we could do was hold each other.

I don’t know how long the swarm lasted. It couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, but I know Ian and I were on the ground for a while after it ended. We screamed into each others’ arms until Muhammed pulled us apart.

We sat in a circle, each of us making sure the silence was real. I broke the stillness and frantically checked myself, shaking every article of clothing as hard as my muscles would let me. I slapped my hair, threw Muhammed’s bag away from me, and nearly pulled my feet off as I shook my boots. Ian and Muhammed followed suit, all of us engaging in an ungraceful dance of slaps and gagging. 

“WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!” I screamed at Muhammed.

“I DIDN’T! I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING! I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE LIGHT WOULDN’T DO ANYTHING!”

“It didn’t! I shined a light at them and nothing happened! You must have done something!” 

“Oh, for sure Becca! I walked over and swang my dick aroun-”  
“GUYS PLEASE!” Ian interrupted. “M-my ears are still ringing, and I’m not certain it’s ever gonna stop. I just woke up to a swarm of wasps the size of my face. I-it’s too much right now, I-I-I can’t deal with this shit right now.”

He was rocking back and forth, the stutter he left behind years ago crawling out of his trembling body. The sight almost forgot Muhammed was there. I wrapped an arm around his shoulder and scratched his back up and down.

“I’m sorry, Ian. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to yell. I’m sorry Med, I’m just… I got…I’ve never been…scared like that…of bugs, y’know?.”

My words hung in the still air. Muhammed looked apologetic, but if he had words to say, they were locked behind his own fear. He ran his hand through his hair and let out a big exhale. It was at that moment I saw it. A welt. At first it only looked like a prominent pimple, a fleshy bump of red peaked with an oozing yellow bile. 

“Med…” I hesitated.

“Beck, I swear I don’t know what happened.”

“No, it’s not that. What’s that on your hand?”

He looked, flinched, then seemed to realize he was in pain. The shock of the swarm faded alongside the hum of the insects. He collapsed to his knees, reaching for his wrist but recoiling in pain from his other arm, still misaligned from the crash. His hand shook, and I rushed toward him. I lifted his hand to see the sting clearly, and nearly vomited at what I saw. 

It wasn’t shock that had blocked the pain. The wound was growing. Not uniformly, but in a straight line, poking from the lump towards the outside of his wrist. It undulated, seeming to breathe, and stretched a little bit further which each imitated exhale. Before I could even relay this to Muhammed, I heard Ian scream louder than any sound I had ever heard him make.

I turned to see him clutching his bloodied leg, a panicked expression plastered across his pale face. He had also been stung, just above the line of his boot. A slowly growing crease of flesh creeped from the blood-red spot, just the same as Muhammed’s. It seemed to be inching upwards, wrapping around the base of his calf.

I’m ashamed to say I didn’t start making a plan. I saw their injuries, my friend and the love of my life, and for a moment I only thought of myself. I frantically checked my body for the same welts, but found nothing. I was swarmed, same as them, yet I was entirely bereft of any stings. However my search did yield something. While my eyes scanned for stings, they instead caught the warm light of the fire reflected in two blue exoskeletons. Two corpses for two stings.

I didn’t let them distract me for long. I quickly rifled through Muhammed’s bag and produced the final two bandages he had brought. I handed one off to Ian and began wrapping Med’s arm. It proved difficult from his shaking, but I managed to clinch it tight. Ian finished wrapping his leg despite the sweat pouring from his palms.

“Change of plans,” I exhaled. “We’re leaving now. It’s a few hours to the farm. We can make it by sunrise if we hurry.”

“I don’t know if Ian can make it on that leg.” Muhammed whimpered.

“No, fuck that.” Ian grunted. “I’m getting out of this c-cave now. I’ll crawl if I have to.”

“I’ll help you up in a second.” I said, scurrying towards the dead insects.

I removed my shirt and gingerly placed each body on top of the cloth. Seeing them this clearly, I was able to make two observations. They each had large antennae, a swollen thorax, and a wide abdomen. I couldn’t be certain without seeing the rest of the hive, but they appeared to share the same physicality of queen wasps. Furthermore, their abdomens appeared to have burst. While common among most species of bees, this immediately struck me as odd for a wasp, especially of this size, even more so as a result of a singular sting. I folded the specimens into the cloth, and placed them in the bag.

“You’re seriously concerned with bug bodies right now?” Muhammed chastised.

“You’re seriously not concerned with the possibility of needing a new, never before synthesized antivenom right now?”

There wasn’t a response. Just the silent realization of an impending doom he hadn’t considered yet.

“Leaving. Now.” Ian said through gritted teeth.

I helped him to his feet, placed his arm around my shoulders again, and began the long walk toward the dim light off the farms on the horizon. Muhammed clutched the flashlight in his unstung hand, swinging both injured arms awkwardly with his steps. I knew the light wouldn’t last us the whole trip, but in my desperation, I didn’t care. It would get us closer to salvation, and that was all that mattered to me.

Over the course of the first hour, Ian leaned more and more of his weight on me. It wasn’t on purpose, just a result of the increasing pain in his leg. His grunts grew louder with each step, only occasionally interrupted by Muhammed’s. We could only see what the flashlight illuminated. We were alone in an ocean of darkness and knee-high grass. I almost welcomed the bites from normal insects that peppered us like rain, and the night’s cold that sharpened me against the mental fog of my concussion. I think it was about two hours of silent walking before Muhammed broke it.

“Ian…how’re you feeling man?”

“My leg hurts, Med. How ‘bout you?”

“It’s my whole arm now. I’m starting to lose the feeling in my fingers.”

“My toes went a few minutes ago. Becca’s being a trooper.”

I was too out of breath to respond, and too scared to think about anything other than my next step.

“Have you looked at yours?” Ian asked.

“Not since we left. I don’t think it’ll help to see it.”

“I had the same thought. Can’t do anything about it now.”

“I’m scared man.”

“I am too, Med.”

“So we just keep walking?

“We just keep walking.”

Another hour into the night. We finally saw actual lights ahead of us instead of their immaterial glow. I was almost entirely carrying Ian. I took their advice, and didn’t try to look at their stings, but I could hear Ian’s foot dragging without purchase underneath him. Muhammed hunched over in a gradually crumpling silhouette, and cried softly into the empty night, only contested by the rising hum of locusts. I had almost forgotten why we originally came here.

“Guys,” I forced out. “We can make it. Just another hour and we’ll be there.”

“Becca…” Ian said, so quietly it could’ve been a whisper. “Do you remember when we first met?”

I struggled to form the weakest “mhm” ever uttered by a human being.

“I saw you at that conference, and I knew. I knew more than anything I had ever known before… that you were the most beautiful woman… I had ever seen… and that I would do anything for you.”

I hoisted him higher for the thousandth time that night, my legs threatening to shatter under his weight.

“I had the same thought, Ian…as soon as I saw you.”

“I’ve never been more certain of anything…until this moment. Now…”

His leg gave. I felt the shift, and in an instant, we were going down. He fell on top of me, limp, pinning me underneath his entire weight. I screamed with the last ounce of voice I had, and pushed. I pushed and pushed, strained every muscle in my body, and eventually rolled him to my side. I squinted through the absolute dark, and could see his eyes flickering between open and shut. He was alive. I stood, my whole body spinning as I searched for Muhammed's light. I didn’t find him standing, but instead saw the beam shining from the ground a few feet ahead of us, obscured by the grass.

I rushed over, and through the light saw what they had refused to.

Muhammed was barely conscious. His limbs were splayed in each direction, giving me a full view of his arm.

The whole thing was turning purple, and his hand had completely eclipsed purple and was shifting toward gray. Impossibly dark veins stretched across the skin, bursting into small patches, creating thick, blotchy spots of brown across the whole rotten thing. Though the sting was still wrapped, the subdermal line that first appeared as just a few centimeters had grown massive. It snaked through his skin, wrapping around and around and around, slithering up the entire limb and disappearing into the sleeve of his shirt.

I screamed Muhammed’s name, but whatever havoc was being wreaked on his body had removed any awareness he could have had. Thinking about how his arm looked, I think that’s the one blessing the stings provided.

I grabbed the flashlight and sprinted back to Ian. I don’t know what I thought I was going to do to help him, but in seeing Muhammed’s state, I had to be by his side. If I could change anything about how I acted in that moment, I should have just kept moving. Seeing what happened was worse than any fate I could have imagined for him.

I pointed the light towards Ian’s leg, and it was revealed to be in the same state as Muhammed’s arm. The outline of whatever sat beneath his skin had spiraled from his ankle to his thigh and into his shorts, leaving his leg the same blend of decaying purple. His knee had stepped at a bad angle at some point and snapped, bending incorrectly on the ground. The blood flow must have already completely halted by that point, because Ian never reacted to the injury.

In another act of complete desperation, I lifted his shirt and removed his pants in an attempt to see where this crawling line was moving to. My hand recoiled to my mouth as a silent scream took over my face. 

The bandages dressing the cut he had gotten in the crash had slipped off, and through the split flesh I could see something. The twisting vine that had killed his leg was some kind of living amalgamation of the yellow ooze that had dripped from the initial sting. A worm of bile inched across the open wound, forcing itself through my husband’s body inch by inch. 

I realized that I couldn’t see it continue above his waist. The worm extended into the leg of his briefs, and disappeared. I reached to remove them, before Ian started shaking. It wasn’t violent or spastic, but a shiver. A persistent convulsion across his entire body.

I didn’t know what to do. I could only place my hands on either side of his face and cry whatever words I could think of, which turned out to be a mix of his name and “please” over and over again. Through my pleading, I heard small noises begin to stir inside of him. Snapping. Squelching. Ripping. Skittering. Humming. I didn’t think about what was happening to him. I just kept saying his name, wishing he would come back to me, and to my horror, he did. For an instantaneous, horrifying moment of lucidity, he looked at me. In those seconds, I saw him realize what was happening to him, and feel every sound I had heard. Then, his eyes rolled back, and with one final sickening tear, he was gone.

I fell back and pushed myself away. I couldn’t see everything, but I saw enough. Blood poured from his groin, seeping into the soil. It looked like the blood itself was moving. Of course, that wasn’t the case. More of those things were on the ground fluttering their juvenile wings and cleaning viscera off of their heads with their front legs. The crimson red struggled to mask their iridescent shells. The first born were already taking flight and vanishing into the grass. I don’t know how many were spawned. They were still pouring out of him when I got to my feet and began sprinting. My shoe hit a puddle that I knew was Muhammed’s, but I didn’t stop to look. I didn’t stop to breathe, I didn’t stop to scream, I didn’t stop to think. I sprinted until I made eye contact with a confused farm hand, where I lost consciousness. 

I woke up in a clinic. Though it was simply a large tent, the equipment I was hooked up to was state of the art. I didn’t have time to admire it, though. Even before I had fully come to, I was screaming. I never remember my dreams, but I’m certain of what this one was. The nurse at my bedside immediately ran to grab the doctor. I thrashed and cried and called for Ian and Muhammed, only stopping once I was sedated.

When I came to again, it was much calmer. Good thing, too, because I could tell the well dressed woman sitting in front of me was of importance to the people that paid for our grant.

“Good evening Dr. Haas. How are you feeling?”

I tried to sit up, but the wooziness of sedation kept me down.

“Alive.”

The woman sat upright and straightened her blazer.

“That’s good to hear. My name is Miranda. I’ve been told you were found alone by one of our workers.”

There was a pause as if she was waiting for a response. She didn’t receive one.

“There were two others with you. Judging by the state you were found in, I’m to assume they’ve passed?”

I struggled to nod, as tears began to drip down my cheeks.

“Truly, my deepest condolences, Doctor. Was it a result of the helicopter malfunction?”

I inhaled through gritted teeth and shook my head no.

“Did it have anything to do with the specimens we found along with your belongings?”

I could feel the terror resurfacing, but I managed to quell it enough to nod again.

“Please, Doctor, whatever information you can give would be of the utmost importance to my employers. For our workers’ safety, and for your recovery.”

So, I told her the story, taking breaks to cry or to hyperventilate. I needed to be sedated twice, but by the following morning, she had all of the information you do. Other doctors and suits occasionally joined, but Miranda was the only one who could stomach the entire thing. When I was finished, she did her best to comfort me as much as her corporate demeanor would allow. She told me I’d receive compensation as the victim of their equipment malfunctioning, and that I would be flown back stateside as soon as I’d like. It took me three more days to feel at all comfortable flying again.

It’s taken me a long time to write all of this down. Every time I’ve sat down to type it out, the tears come back, as do the shakes. Thinking about it all over again, it’s overwhelming, as you can imagine. I can only get a few sentences out at a time, but it’s important you all know this. I’ve done the math. Theoretically, those things can reproduce at an unprecedented rate. A hive of queen wasps that, through one sting, can create an entirely new hive. Maybe it’s only through humans, but they could possibly use other mammals, reptiles, birds, or even fish. 

I’m sure research has been underway for months now. The only thing I’d be curious to know at this point is where they came from. I’m a woman of science, but if there is a Hell, these creatures are its latest creation. They may not be a danger to my biology, but I’ll always remember that last look Ian gave me. Nothing of this world should be able to do that to a person.
