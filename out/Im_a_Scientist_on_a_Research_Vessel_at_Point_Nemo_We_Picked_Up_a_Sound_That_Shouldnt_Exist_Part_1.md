We weren’t supposed to hear anything.

That’s the first thing you need to understand. Point Nemo is the most remote place on Earth—over a thousand miles from the nearest scrap of land. It’s called the oceanic pole of inaccessibility for a reason. Nothing lives there. Nothing calls out from those depths.

And yet, we heard something.

My name is Dr. Julian Arnes. I specialize in deep-sea acoustics—mapping ocean-floor movements, tracking subduction zones, translating the creaks and groans of the Earth into readable data. It’s dull work most days. Numbers and waveforms, subtle shifts in pressure that only a few of us understand.

But this expedition was different.

We were deployed aboard the Acheron, a private-funded research vessel built like a floating lab. State-of-the-art sonar arrays, hydrophones, seismic sensors—the works. We were here to monitor an increase in deep-sea tremors around Point Nemo. A series of microquakes had lit up the Pacific plate—small, frequent, and getting closer together.

The tremors weren’t the strange part.

The sound was.

It started three nights into the mission. I was reviewing hydroacoustic logs when I saw a spike—low frequency, sustained, repeating at irregular intervals. It wasn’t a whale call or geological movement. It had structure.

It sounded… intentional.

I isolated the recording and ran it through our systems. No match. I thought maybe the equipment had picked up feedback from our own engines. But when I asked Engineering, they confirmed we were drifting under dead propulsion. No mechanical noise. No sonar pings. No shipping lanes nearby.

So I played it back, this time through the main comm speakers.

It was like listening to a cathedral groan underwater. A deep, droning resonance that vibrated in your bones more than your ears. Not a cry. Not a voice.

A presence.

That’s when people started having nightmares.

Dr. Satomi, our geologist, said she dreamed of pressure—of being hundreds of meters below sea level with something wrapped around her body, whispering in a language she didn’t understand. Torres, our sonar tech, refused to sleep at all after the second night. He swore he saw shapes in the bathymetric scans—structures that looked unnatural. Geometric.

Symmetrical.

I tried to stay grounded. Data doesn’t lie, I told myself. But that same night, the sound came again—louder. Closer.

This time, it wasn’t just on the equipment.

It shook the hull.

The ship’s lights flickered. The inertial sensors jumped. I felt it in my teeth—a vibration like a tuning fork struck against the world’s spine. Something was moving beneath us. Something massive.

That’s when we lost contact with the satellite.

One second we had full signal—weather feeds, position tracking, real-time data relay—and the next, nothing. Total black-out. We couldn’t even get GPS. The stars above were obscured by thick cloud cover, and the compass started spinning uselessly in its housing.

We were untethered.

Alone.

We tried deploying an emergency beacon, but the signal never locked. Something was interfering with the transmission. The techs said it felt like we were under something. Like the entire sky had dropped a blanket over us.

Two crew members went missing that night.

No one heard anything. No one saw anything. Their cabins were empty—beds unmade, personal items still in place. Life jackets untouched. We searched every square meter of the vessel, every crawlspace, even the ballast tanks.

Nothing.

The next morning, we discovered the final seismic map I’d printed out before the blackout.

I didn’t remember making it.

It showed a trench that didn’t exist on any chart. A jagged tear descending far deeper than the Mariana. The coordinates placed it directly beneath us. At the very bottom, in my handwriting—though I don’t recall writing it—was a single word.

“Doorway.”

We should have turned back. We tried. But the engines wouldn’t respond. The ocean had gone still—unnaturally still. No waves. No wind. The water had turned to glass, reflecting the ship in crisp, perfect symmetry.

Except there was no reflection of us on the deck.

No movement in the mirrored image. Just an empty version of the Acheron, drifting across a still sea, with no crew. No lights.

No life.

Now I’m the only one left.

They’re all gone. Some vanished without a trace. Others… changed. They spoke in monotone, walked in strange loops, stared into the water like it was whispering to them. And one by one, they jumped.

I tried to stop them.

Tried.

But now I hear the sound, even without the equipment. I feel it in my skull like a migraine made of static. The last thing we recorded before the mainframe died was a single tone, stretched across seventeen minutes.

The waveform had teeth.

This is the last entry I’ll send through the emergency console before it goes dead. If you’re reading this, do not come looking. Do not triangulate our last position.

Some doors were never meant to be found.
