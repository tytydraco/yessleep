It was during the summer of late 2022. My cousin and I had been ordained to become novice monks in a rural temple up in the mountains of Chiang Mai province. The temple, where we had to live for the next month, was built upon an old mountain graveyard donated by the local ethnic people in the area.

Our cubicle was a small building that could only fit two people to sleep inside. There was a window next to the doorframe that gave a clear view of the outside. The bathroom was located downhill from the cubicle, and at night, there was no source of light nearby. Because of that, my cousin and I made a promise: whenever one of us needed to go to the toilet in the middle of the night, we would wake the other person to go with us.

One night, I suddenly woke up around 3 AM and found myself alone in the cubicle. I was confused about my cousin’s whereabouts, so I got up and walked outside. As I stepped out, I saw that my cousin was at the toilet downstairs. I was relieved that he wasn’t far away, so I went back inside the cubicle and closed the door.

Just as I was about to lay down on my makeshift bed, I suddenly heard and felt the distinct sound of someone running toward the cubicle with heavy footsteps. The sound was coming from the right side, but the bathroom was to the left. I brushed it off, thinking my cousin had finished and was running back.

Before I could fully get up, someone was already at the door, knocking. I yelled, “The door is unlocked! You can open it!” But the person started twisting the doorknob like they couldn’t get in. At this point, I was frustrated we only had an hour left before morning prayer at 4 AM.

I got up, grabbed the doorknob, and twisted it open. I pushed the door roughly, hoping it would hit my cousin’s face so he’d stop twisting the damn doorknob.

Then nothing.

I popped my head out to see what was going on. There was nobody in sight and nowhere for anyone to hide. Now I was really perplexed.

From the doorframe, I could see the entire area between me and the nearby forest. The temple was right in front of our cubicle, and I had a clear view of surrounding. There wasn’t a single soul moving around except for my cousin, who came hastily running up from the bathroom and quickly rushed inside the cubicle.

At that point, I went from perplexed to concerned. We were on holy ground, after all, and having an unknown person or thing run toward our cubicle in the dead of night was not a good sign.

I got back in and explained the situation to my cousin. I told him to lock all the windows from the inside since we apparently couldn’t account for who or what had been trying to get in. From there, we just waited for morning prayer, performed it as usual, and informed our mentor monk.

We didn’t hear anything else strange that night.
