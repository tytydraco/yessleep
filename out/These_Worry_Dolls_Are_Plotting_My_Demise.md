I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn’t much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for “tobacco only.” Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She’s loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It’s her love language. 



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn’t tell me what it was until I opened it. 



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of… “Tell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.”



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night. 



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn’t do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often. 



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn’t thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place. 



It wasn’t until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read “$0.50 bin” written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch. 



I didn’t need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together. 



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn’t even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table. 



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about. 



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn’t going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its “face” was upward. This didn’t help my growing anxiety by any means. 



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls. 



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls. 



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren’t there. It was like I had never taken them. 



I backed out to make sure they weren’t in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren’t there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message. 



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn’t moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house. 



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying “You’re a creepy little thing,” with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal. 



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren’t necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props. 



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I’d just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That’s why they tend to come in groups or pairs. 



I spoke the words out loud, “I just want a fulfilling job.”



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren’t looking in the mouth at the “right angle”. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn’t put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say. 



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn’t take long for me to fall into a deep sleep. 



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore. 



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn’t going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and  got a half hearted “feel better” from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube. 



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, “Call Sissy’s facetime,” I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. “Hunter! Stop hitting your brother!” she shouted before turning her attention to me. 



“Sorry, what’s up?” She said with an exhausted smile. 



“Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?” 



“Yea,”



“Well mine looks super weird,” I said with a nervous giggle. 



“What do you mean?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. 



“There was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It’s bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,” 



“Lemme see,” she said, looking more disturbed than before. 



“I tried sending pics last night but they wouldn’t load, or take. I’ll see if I can get it to work,” I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone. 



My sister didn’t say anything for a second, most likely confused. “Bro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.” 



“Check under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.” 



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. “Hey, lemme call you back,” I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. “Maybe I put it in here and didn’t remember,” I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn’t blank. She was frowning and crying… tears of blood. 



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. “What the fuck?” I whispered to myself. 



I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn’t reach out much, so I was stumped. 



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least. 



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



 A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read “Addie,” my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I’m a pushover.



“Hey,” I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

 

“Hey girl,” the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, “something crazy just happened.” My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn’t see it. 



“What?” 



“Dr. Salepka died this morning,” she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch. 



“What? What-How?” I sputtered in shock.



“Jane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,”



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in “private” but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night. 



“Oh my god… that’s insane Addie. Is Jane okay?” I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome. 



“She was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she’s still coming in on Monday,” I scoffed at her disregard for the situation. 



“Okay Addie, I’m still not feeling well so I’m gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,” I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn’t even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands. 



Images of Dr. Salepka’s dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn’t seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn’t help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter. 



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind. 



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel… happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from. 



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house. 



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It’s like my brain knew it didn’t want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now. 



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.  Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I’ll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.
