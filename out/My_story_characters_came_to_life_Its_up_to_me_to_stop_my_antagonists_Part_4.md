“Okay, I think I’m ready,” Sidney said, hoisting her overnight bag onto her back. 

“Perfect. Just let me grab my stuff, and we’ll be ready to go.”

“Where are we going again?” she asked as I threw my backpack on. 

“We’re going to this little town called Cape Hood. It’s in Arkansas. It’s going to be about a four and a half hour drive.”

“Well, this should be fun. How did you even find out which town you were talking about in the story? You didn’t write in a name, did you?”

“I did some research while you were at home grabbing your things. Remember that kid that I mentioned going missing at the beginning?”

She sheepishly shook her head.

“I guess someone still hasn’t read my stories… On the first page or so, I wrote that this kid named Johnny Cameron went missing after a trip to Chuck E. Cheese’s. He’s presumed dead, and his family was cursed. I was able to find the town by searching the kid’s name. The local news station published an article about it.”

“Makes sense. Let’s go ahead and get on the road. I want to get this over with. Chuck E. Cheese gives me the creeps.”

We turned to depart for our trip. I suddenly stopped in my tracks. Jake’s door squeaked as he peaked his head around the corner. 

“Where are y’all going?” he timidly asked as he stared at his feet. 

“We’re going to Arkansas. We’ll be gone for a couple days. We’ve got a rat to kill.”

“Wait… I’m coming with you.”

“Are you sure? We can handle this if you still need some alone time. I don’t want you to feel like you have to.”

“I’ll be fine. I’m not going to let something happen to you two just because I’m in my feelings. Wouldn’t do me any good to mope around the house while y’all are gone anyway.”

“Alright. Grab your things and let’s head out.”

We were on the road ten minutes later. The ride there was uneventful. Rows of endless cornfields made for a less than exciting trip. Jake slept most of the time, while Sidney served as our DJ. By the time we arrived, I hoped I’d never have to listen to another Taylor Swift song for as long as I lived. After hours of winding through monotonous backroads and one-light towns, we finally made it. 

The sleepy little town wasn’t noteworthy in any way. If you blinked you’d probably miss it. It was exactly what I’d expected. Mom-and-pop shops lined the town square, and run-down houses were dotted throughout the landscape. It didn’t take long to find Chuck E. Cheese’s. 

My car crept into the nearly empty parking lot. The setting sun lent an eerie air to the atmosphere that made the decrepit shell of a building seem that much creepier. I noted that there was a Chevy Tahoe along with a police cruiser parked alongside each other a few spaces down. Two men leaned against the back of the Chevy. They leered at us suspiciously as we rolled to a stop.

“Jake, wake up. We’re here.”

I jostled his leg until he inevitably stirred from his nap. 

“Wha- uh. I’m awake. I’m awake.”

“Uh, Matt,” Sidney whispered, nodding toward my window. 

I nearly jumped out of my skin, smacking my head on the roof of the car. An older looking police officer stood on the other side, motioning for me to roll the window down. I obliged, rubbing my throbbing head. The officer tilted his glasses so that his dark brown eyes met mine.

“Now, I don’t know what you kids are doing here, but you need to get lost. We don’t take kindly to visitors.”

He spat in the dirt and glared at me intensely.

“Just let me explain. You’re Officer Jenkins, aren’t you? And I’m assuming he’s Cole?” I asked, pointing to the man who was now making his way toward the vehicle.

“Look, son. I don’t know how you know that, but it would be in your best interest to scram. You don’t want to be booked on trespassing charges, do you? Because I can arrange that.”

“Marshall, let’s just hear them out. Maybe they have a good reason for being here. They don’t seem like bad kids from what I can tell,” the second man urged, keeping his voice low.

“Alright, talk. No bullshit. I’ll know if you’re lying.”

I explained the whole story to him, making sure to include every tiny detail. Officer Jenkins interrupted me multiple times for clarification, each time reiterating that he’d throw us in a cell in a heartbeat if he thought we weren’t telling the truth. His friend stayed silent. By the end, both their faces had drained of color. They shot each other a nervous glance. 

“I thought we were the only ones who knew,” Officer Jenkins mumbled. 

“So did I,” his companion whispered, “but they’re here now, and they seem like they’re telling the truth, so I don’t see any harm in letting them help out. Honestly, we could probably use it.”

“Okay. You can help. You can start by telling us your names.”

“This is Matt. That dunder-head in the back is Jake. And I’m Sidney.”

She reached over me to extend a hand to the men. Officer Jenkins disregarded it coldly. The second man shook it, giving her a soft smile that didn’t reach his eyes. 

“Cole. Nice to meet you all.”

“So, what’s the game plan?” I chimed in. 

“We’ve got enough gas in the back of my car to fuel Burning Man for a year. Marshall and I are going to set the place ablaze. We’ve been waiting for a few days to send this puppy up in flames. It’s rained every day since I’ve been here, so this is the first chance we’re getting.”

“Sounds like a solid plan. How can we help?” Jake implored.

Cole pondered for a moment. 

“I’ve got it. Start unboarding that window over there. We’re going to smash it in so you can alert us if Chuck E. shows up while we’re dumping the gas.”

“Perfect. Do you have a crowbar we can use?” I asked.

“Yeah, Let me get it from the car.”

Cole trotted to his Chevy and returned with a silver crowbar, handing it to me. We all hopped out of the car and tentatively approached the window. I went to work on it, and the boards popped off with ease. The elements had worn them away, and in no time we had a clear view of the building’s interior. 

It was like a time capsule. The whole thing was coated in a thick layer of dust, evidence that the place had been untouched for decades. A sea of retro arcade games lay scattered throughout the massive room. At the front of the playhouse sat a ticket counter, hundreds of unclaimed prizes lying behind the glass. To our left was a dining area. Purple picnic tables sat abandoned, never to be used again. A children’s play area loomed in the corner, a network of winding plastic multicolored tubes intersecting at all angles. The heart-stopping things though, were the animatronics. Three decaying cartoon-like characters glared at us from atop a stage, eyes locked onto us and overflowing with unbridled hatred. 

“Move over,” Cole demanded.

He snatched the crowbar from my grip and smashed the window with one fell swoop, clearing the shattered glass from the edges once he was done.

“Stand watch and yell for us if that *thing* decides to rear its ugly head. And, as I’m sure you already know, don’t go in there under any circumstances. This place is cursed, and if something happens to us, there’s no use in making your lives a living Hell.”

“Got it. I have a feeling that if this abomination is still alive, we’ll be just fine,” I grinned, unholstering my firearm. 

“Even better,” Cole smirked. 

“Before y’all go, though,” Jake interjected, “Officer Jenkins, why are you here? I thought you didn’t actually go in the place after Cole and his friends.”

“Who do you think they called after the first kid went missing?” 

Cole sidled up to me and whispered in my ear. 

“His wife left him and took the kids. He’s hoping this will get them back.”

I nodded and pursed my lips. 

“Let’s get this over with, son. You’ve got a family to get back to.”

“Right. Time to burn that rat where he stands.”

We watched as Cole and Officer Jenkins lugged gallons upon gallons of gasoline into the forsaken structure. They started with the stage. I could’ve sworn the spiteful eyes of the animatronics followed them as they did so. They dragged the open plastic containers through the entire room, dousing the floors and flinging petrol on everything in sight. They reached the ticket counter, and that’s when I saw it. 

The restroom door gradually creaked open. What slipped out chilled me to my core. A colossal rat stepped into the dim moonlight, sniffing wildly, its nose pointed toward the ceiling. Its gray matted fur was patchy and disheveled. Even at our distance, I thought I could make out little specks of dried blood coagulated within it. Jagged orange teeth protruded from its oversized jaw, chattering manically, as its long pink tail swayed back and forth like a pendulum. And the worst part; even after all those years, that tattered bloodstained T-shirt still hugged its chest. 

Sidney shrieked, alerting Cole and Officer Jenkins to his presence. Out of nowhere, all the ancient arcade games instantly burst to life, flooding the room with blinding light and a cacophony of distorted soundtracks. Chuck E.’s eyes darted around the room as he attempted to locate his prey. Cole and Officer Jenkins hid adjacent to each other. Cole ducked behind the ticket booth, while Jenkins crouched behind Pac-Man. 

I snapped out of the stupor I had unknowingly fallen into. I fired two shots at the beast. And missed. It scampered off, in the direction of our cohorts. I kept my aim locked on Chuck E., unable to get a clear shot. We watched in horror as Chuck E. found Officer Jenkins and pounced on him, sending the pair tumbling to the floor.

Chuck E. unhinged his jaw, gargantuan teeth primed to burrow into Officer Jenkins’s neck.

*Pow. Pow. Pow.* 

Rapid gunfire rang out as Officer Jenkins unloaded his entire clip into the vermin’s gut. It released a guttural roar, but toppled to the ground, allowing Officer Jenkins to escape unscathed. Cole emerged from behind the ticket booth. 

“Close one, huh?” he muttered, as Officer Jenkins kicked the monstrosity in the mouth, his steel-toed boot shattering those horrid teeth with a single blow.

“You got that right.”

They began to return to the back of the building to leave. I had a sinking feeling that Chuck E. Cheese’s hadn’t finished with them yet, though. And to my utter disbelief, I was right. The three crumbling animatronics jolted to life, squeaking joints resounding over the symphony of dissonant machines. They stepped from the stage as Cole and Officer Jenkins stared in shock, effectively cutting off their exit.

The animatronics trundled towards them, slowly making progress. A chef with a long black mustache led the charge, mechanical hands reaching to grab the terrified duo. A white bird in a ragged pink skirt trailed him, rabidly snapping her faded yellow beak. A beagle dressed in overalls followed suit, wielding a rugged splintered banjo as a weapon.

“Cole! Jenkins! Over here!” I screamed, gun trained on the robots. 

They snapped their heads in our direction and began sprinting toward the broken window. I was nearly knocked off balance when Jake yanked my shirt sleeve as he tore off a large chunk of fabric. 

“H-hey! What do you think you’re doing?”

“I’ll buy you a new shirt later. Just trust me. I have an idea. I need you to unlock the car. You still have that lighter in the glove box from your stoner phase, right?”

“Yeah, it should still be there.”

“Awesome.”

He darted to the car and began rifling through the glove compartment. Sidney raised an eyebrow at me.

“Don’t give me that look. I was going through a tough time, okay?”

“I never said I had a problem with it. I just didn’t peg you as a smoker.”

“It was a coping mechanism. Can we please focus on the task at hand?”

Jake returned with a handful of assorted items. He’d gathered the lighter, a glass Coke bottle, some gasoline that Cole had left behind, and my tattered shirt sleeve. 

“You’re a genius, bro.”

“I know. You can thank me later.”

Jake cautiously filled the bottle with gas and stuffed the ripped fabric inside. Cole had just climbed out the window, while Officer Jenkins was beginning to do so himself. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement directly behind him. My eyes grew wide as dinner plates as I helplessly watched Chuck E. rise to his feet. Cole snatched my handgun from my grip. 

“Give me that. I’m going to make that bastard pay.”

He shoved Officer Jenkins the rest of the way out of the window and aimed straight for Chuck E.’s gnarled face. 

“See you in Hell, you ugly piece of-”

*Boom.*

Right between the eyes. Chuck E. let out one last agonized screech as his oversized body crumpled to the floor. It wasn’t time to celebrate yet, though. The first of the animatronics trudged through the inky black puddle that the rodent had already melted into. Jake lit his molotov cocktail.

“Everybody stand back.”

He cocked his arm like a quarterback and sent it flying through the air. It shattered on the ground directly in front of the glowering mascots, sending the whole building up in flames. We stood back and watched in awe as flames licked the entire structure, black smoke billowing high into the cool night air. 

Jake placed a meaty hand on my shoulder as we watched it burn. After everything we’d been through, there was something serene about watching that awful building crumble. 

“I’m really glad you decided to come with us, Jake,” I said.

“So am I. We couldn’t have done it without you,” Sidney muttered, still transfixed on the blazing inferno.

“I love you guys,” Jake whimpered as a tear rolled down his cheek.

“Aw, bring it in,” I said, tears welling up in my own eyes. 

Sidney and I threw our arms around Jake, and he embraced us. We stood there clasped in each others’ grip for what felt like hours, just reveling in the moment. 

*Crash.* 

We were snapped from our reverie as the roof of the building collapsed, crumbling to the floor with a deafening bang. 

“Y’all had better get going. Someone’s bound to call the fire department sooner or later,” Cole said. 

“He’s right. We all need to hit the road before someone catches wind of this. Be safe out there. And kids… thank you.” 

Officer Jenkins gave us an approving nod as he slipped into the front seat of his police cruiser. Cole made his rounds and shook each of our hands. 

“Really, thank you. You don’t know how big of a weight off my shoulders it is to see that place in ruins.”

“We’re happy to have been able to help. Take care of yourself, Cole,” I said, turning to my friends. 

“We’d better find somewhere to rest. We’ll need it. We’ve got a wendigo to kill.”
