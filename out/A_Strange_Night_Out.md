One day, I was over at Elijah’s. He had asked for help with something and it started to rain heavily after we were done so I decided to stay a little longer. It was around March, I think, and so the weather had been pretty drowsy for a while. I thought the rain looked peaceful enough, so I watched it in the kitchen, waiting for things to lighten up. Elijah walked up and sat next to me at the table. 

“I’ve never really been a rain person.” He said leaning his head on his hand.

I looked up at him as if he said something insane. “How? It’s so relaxing.”

“Ehh, I don’t know, the rain always makes me feel miserable.”

I nodded “I guess, you freak.”

He scoffed, and looked out the window for a bit, before turning back to me.

“I’ve got no plans tonight if you would like to go out to dinner.”

“Like a date?” I said, an apprehensive look plastered onto my face.

“No, no. I just got a gift card and want to use it, " he said, his face turning slightly red.

“Oh yeah sure.”.

He looked at me beaming with a bright smile. “Great.”

My mom called me shortly after. I stood up and walked over to the living room, leaning on the table by the door. I was fidgeting with some papers while talking to my mom when I noticed a small folder. I looked at it, it looked like a police report. I was about to open it, but my mom took my attention saying that I needed to go home before it was too late. When I got home my mom asked me for help packing some more things since my dad was out with friends. It was so weird seeing the house so empty, not everything was out, but most of the decorations and small furniture were gone, it just seemed so hollow. I looked up at the wall in front of me. I saw the small scratches on the wall where Markus accidentally pulled the whole Christmas tree down, breaking half our ornaments. I saw the slight discoloration of the paint where my parents hung up our photos and childhood art. I looked down at my hands.

I didn’t want to leave this place, but it was eating me from the inside. I wished whatever was here would just lose interest in me, but it was never going to end like that. I just hoped it wouldn’t follow us. My dad walked into the house, noticing me sitting alone. He asked if I was ok, before bringing some food into the kitchen. He asked if I was hungry which reminded me, that I had to get ready for dinner. I looked at my phone realising what time it was. I stood up and walked to my room, throwing on the first dress I found. I texted Elijah that I was ready and walked downstairs where my parents were packing the kitchen. My dad looked at me, before asking where I was going. I replied that I was going out with Elijah and a smile crept on my dad's face. 

“Finally.” he said.

My mom pointed at my dress. “You wanna wear that, you look like you're going to a funeral.”

“I do not, and it’s not even a date, I just like free food.” I said sarcastically.

“You really are my kid.” My dad said proudly.

I scoffed before hugging them goodbye and walking over to the front. I grabbed my coat and threw on my purse. I opened the door to see Markus about to ring the doorbell. I stepped back a little in surprise.

“Markus, what are you doing here?” I asked

“I just wanted to talk about something.” He said, looking at my dress and then back at me.

“I’m sorry, I can't. I’m going out.”.

“Oh…”

The dark circles under his eyes grew pronounced in my vision. 

“Something wrong kiddo?” My dad asked, walking up behind me.

Markus shifted his gaze to my dad.“No, I’m alright.” He smiled.

“You wanna come in and help pack?” He asked.

“Yeah.” Markus said, walking inside. 

I looked back at him. He held his arms tight, he looked tired. 

“Hey, you need me to cancel?” I asked.”

“He looked at me and smiled. “Don’t worry it’s nothing crazy.” He put his hand on my arm. “I’m just a little tired, and wanted to talk, I’ll be here when you come back.”

He told me to have fun and basically pushed me out the door, telling me to order the most expensive thing I could. When Elijah pulled up. I climbed inside. He looked at me with a wide smile of excitement. When we got there we talked for a while making small talk, and eventually, the subject somehow got to home decor.

“I hate minimalism, my worst enemy.”

“You know, I couldn’t agree more like this is your house, not a mental facility.”

“Yeah, the other day Markus and I saw-”

He sat up quickly, coughing up the food he was eating. “What!?” He asked rushingly.

I looked at him confused.“What?”

“Why are you talking to Markus?” He said choking a little.

“Why not?”

His smile dropped a little bit before smiling again. “Well, since that fight you guys had, I thought you guys were done talking.”

"Why does it matter?" I said a little defensively.

"Because he ignored you for almost a year, and you're just going to let it go?" He said angrily.

My frustration grew, and I put my hands on the table and leaned forward watching my volume "You don't understand, Elijah."

"What don't I understand?"

“Well…” I looked down at my hands. I wanted to avoid telling him, but I knew I had to break the news to him. 

“I wanted to talk before I left. My parents are planning on moving…”

He looked at me, shocked. “What, why?”

“They say this place isn't good for me. With all this stuff going on.”

He fell silent for a while. “How far?”

“Three hours.” I replied quietly.

He nodded, brushing his fingers through his hair. “Do you want to move?” He asked.

“No, I don’t, I don’t want to leave. I grew up here.”

He looked down at his drink for a while, nervously tapping the table. “Well if you want.” He paused, taking a deep breath. “Well if you want, you can move in with me.” He looked up at me nervously before looking back at his drink. “As friends, obviously.”

I was about to say something when the waiter came over again, asking if we were ready to order our food. We awkwardly ordered and were left in silence, besides from his nervous tapping. I took a sip of my drink, avoiding saying anything. 

He sat up straight with a smile. “I’m sorry, I made it weird, I shouldn’t have said that, forget about it.” He laughed before looking down at the table.

“I’ll think about it.” I said.

He looked up at me. “ That 's fine, You don’t need to, I was just offering.”

 “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.”

“It’s ok.” He said with a smirk.

Dinner was way better after that, he seemed to take it well. When we pulled into my street I noticed Marku’s car was still there, though I didn’t mention it to Elijah. He pulled over and I hopped out of the car.

“I’m just gonna say goodnight out here, my parents are probably tired from packing all day.”

“Ok, just tell them that I said hi.”

“I will.”

I walked in the warm air and the smell of fresh bread washed over me. I threw my hair in a bun, hung my keys up on the wall, and shook my coat up placing it on the coat rack. Markus was wrapping our glassware in blankets and bubble wrap. He looked up at me and smiled, before focusing on the glass again. My parents welcomed me home and Markus put the glassware down into the box and walked up to me.

“How was dinner?”

“It was good, however, I didn’t get the most expensive thing.”

“Darn.” He said mockingly.

 I put my hand on Markus's arm. “We can go to my room to talk now.”

“Sure.” He shrugged.

We walked into my room and sat down on my bed, and Markus quietly followed, sitting next to me.

“What did you want to talk about earlier?”

He shook his head. “It’s nothing crazy… I'’ve been pretty paranoid lately.”

“Why?”

“I’ve been getting the feeling that someone’s watching me. I’ve tried to ignore it but I keep waking up with this weird feeling, and honestly, I’m getting worried that something might happen to me or my mom.”

I saw that same fearful look I had seen so many times before. I opened my mouth to speak, but his phone started to ring. He looked down at his phone and picked it up.

“Sorry, my mom's calling.” He stood up and walked to the hallway.

He closed the door behind him and I looked at the bathroom door infront of me. I thought to myself, begging he’s actually just paranoid and there's nothing to worry about. I closed my eyes pleading there was nothing wrong.  I opened my eyes, a sting bringing me out of my thoughts. Lifting my hands away from my legs, I saw deep red marks. I had dug my nails deep into my thighs. I Rubbed the blood away and wiped the tears from my face. He opened the door and I looked up at him covering my legs with my hands.

“I’m sorry, I have to go.”

I stood up. “Really, are you sure?”

“It's getting late, my mom’s out of town and doesn’t want me driving around at night while she’s away.” His eyes drifted to my thighs peeking through the small slit of my dress. “You ok?” He said pointing.

“Yeah, forget that, Do you really have to go?”

“Uhm, no actually I don't, why did you do that?” He walked up to me.

“ I…I’m just worried about you.”

“You don’t need to worry, I said I was just paranoid, bad sleep is all.”

“But what if you’re not.” I groaned in stress, before sitting back down on the bed. He sat next to me before laying down on his back and spreading his arm around the bed. We sat in silence for a while.

“I don’t know, I just hope I’m being paranoid. I don’t know what to do.”

“I’m sorry,” I said quietly

“Do you remember my ninth birthday, how my dad went all out?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Well, that night my dad and I were watching a movie when he paused it suddenly. He told me he wasn't always going to be here, and that it was my responsibility to be there for my mom…Of course, I was confused I didn’t know why he was saying that. I thought he was invincible, I told him what he was saying was silly and to unpause the movie…. but he looked at me and told me to promise, then I realized he was serious, and I got so scared.”

 he paused, taking a deep breath. 

“I saw it in his eyes, he knew, I think he knew for a while, but it became real. I promised to him, I promised I would keep her safe, and do anything to be there for her. Now I feel so hopeless, I feel like anything could happen at any time, I just don’t know what to do.” Tears welled in his eyes, and he quickly wiped them away.

“I just feel like I'm failing him.”

I turned to him, looking down at his face, his cheeks red and his eyes glossy staring at the ceiling.

“Markus, you're not failing him, don’t say that, don’t ever tell yourself that.”

“I’m not sure anymore…” His voice was quiet and full of pain.

I never made Markus talk about him, and I think he made himself never think about him. With all our strange life events I think it was a distraction, until now. I leaned down and hugged him tightly, I could feel his chest rise and fall rapidly as he held back his tears, but he couldn’t hold them for long, he wrapped his arms around me and started sobbing, he cried and hyperventilated, wiping tears from his eyes, but he couldn't keep up. I hugged him silently, he needed to cry, all these years of pain bottled up grief, I could never even imagine how he felt.

My dad knocked on the door. I looked down at Makrus, who sat up. I told my dad he could come in and he opened the door slowly. He looked at us and asked if everything was ok, a sad and concerned look in his eyes. I nodded. Markus told my dad what we were talking about. My dad walked in and leaned against the wall. His eyes grew a little glossy and a weak smile came over his face. My dad and him grew up together here before my dad moved and met my mom in Arizona. I think the real reason my dad tried to find a job here was because of him, even if my dad never admitted it.

“I’m always here for you guys. I want you to remember that I’m here” 

Markus nodded silently. My dad walked up and hugged us both. My dad pulled back and repeated he was here for when we needed him, and he left the room. I looked back at Markus who took a deep breath before regaining that stupid smirk he always has. He looked at me and laughed a little. We talked for a while before falling asleep out of exhaustion. In the middle of the night, I woke up to the moonlight shining in my eyes. I sat up slowly. I  looked up at the sky, the sky was black, and the moon was shining brightly. Casting my shadow across the room behind me. I looked over to Markus, who was out cold. I stood up and walked to the window, I had forgotten to close the curtains. I looked down at the street. My shoulders relaxed, no one was out. I carefully closed the curtains, before climbing back in bed. 

The next morning I woke up to Markus and my dad making breakfast, I opened my bedroom door to see my mom do the same across the hallway. We walked downstairs and were welcomed by eggs and pancakes. We ate together chatting. My dad asked us how we slept, and I saw my mom shoot him a look, but he was oblivious. Markus said he slept well, and I eagerly made a joke, saying he took all the blankets. My dad laughed, however, my mom stayed silent. We spent the rest of the day packing until dinner. Mom made soup and grilled cheese sandwiches, and we all watched a movie together. Afterward, Markus wanted to get home since his mother was coming back that night. I reluctantly walked out to the porch.

“Be safe.” I said smiling.

 

He shook his head and smiled slightly. “I’ll be fine. Goodnight Billie.”

When I got back inside, my mother tried to scold me for letting Markus sleep in my room, in my bed no less, but my dad quickly shut that down, and let me go up to bed.
