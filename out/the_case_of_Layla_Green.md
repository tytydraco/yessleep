I lived my whole life in this town name Blakefield. Blakefield is your small typical town, everybody knows everybody and nothing ever happening here. this town is so boring and remote that you wouldn’t found it on any map. well that isn’t completely true, 
one thing did happened some time ago but we don’t talk about it in our small town. 



because you see, once you are talking about what happened to Layla Green you are opening an old wound that shook our small town to his core. at least that’s what my mom used to say to me when I asked her about that. but I was always curious about the case of Layla Green and once I turned 17 this year my mom finally gave in and told about it.



it was march of 2005. our small town was as quiet and peaceful as always. in our town there were around 100 teenagers that all went to our local high school. one of them was a 16 year old girl named Layla Green. Layla was a beautiful girl with red hair and brown eyes and a big heart. everybody loved Layla and always wanted to be around her. many boys wanted her but she didn’t want any of them. Layla was a junior and a smart student and wanted to go to medical school after she graduated. one of the boys that liked Layla was named Theo. Theo was a senior at the time and one of the popular boys. and yes I know that it’s sound stupid calling a him a popular boy but I guess that’s how it was back then? never mind. 
so Theo used to ask Layla out a lot but she always refused. because like I said she didn’t care about boys and dating, but also because she already was in a relationship. she didn’t tell her parents because they wouldn’t approve him and if her “friends” knew then the whole town would know in seconds. and also because he asked her not to tell to anyone. 



because Layla dated a teacher. yup. she dated her history teacher Mr. McLean. Layla always loved her teachers but she had a special spot for Mr. McLean. he always gave her extra attention and appreciation and it wasn’t bad that he was young and attractive. and when one day he asked her if she can stay extra couple minutes after class she thought she’d die on the spot. and when Mr. McLean told her how she his favorite student and that she is so mature to her age, their relationship started. they met after school and between classes and felt so in love with each others. they knew they had to be careful or they be screwed. but it’s was Mr. McLean birthday soon enough and Layla couldn’t wait to go and wish him happy birthday, so that day they weren’t carful as always. and when they kissed with the class door open on Mr. McLean free period and Theo happened to pass by and see them he was disgusted to say the least. 





his first thought was to beat the shit out of Mr. McLean but when he realized it’s not really an option he decided to go to tell to the guide consular. now something I didn’t know about my mom is that she used to work at our high school before that I was born as a consular. yes, my mom was the person that Theo went to when he found out about Mr. McLean and Layla. what that nobody knew at the time was that my mom was also in a relationship with Mr. McLean. I can’t imagine what she felt when she found out that her boyfriend is sleeping with his student and cheating on her. but she was an adult and had to do something. so she told Theo to be quiet for the time being. after some thinking she decided to handle it on her own without making a big deal. because she knew that Mr. McLean would be a dead man if the people of Blakefield found out, and more than that she knew if they found out she was involved with him they were going to go after her too. 



so on the 21 of march 2005 my mom called Theo to her office and told him to invite Layla on a date for that night. Theo tried to explain how he tried many times to ask her but she turn him down. but my mom is a smart woman and told him to ask out Megan, a girl that Layla hated a lot. and sure enough that’s what he did and that piss Layla a lot. because how dare he to ask out a girl that she hates even though she turn him down many times? 
as you might realize I’m not a fan of Layla Green. either way that worked, and by lunch time that day Layla approached Theo and ask him why he who’d ask Megan on a date? and he explained that he can’t wait forever for her and he have to move on. and that sentence alone send Layla to ask him if he wants to go with her that night under the condition of canceling the date with Megan. and he ofc agreed and ask her to go with him on a walk in the woods that surrounded around Blakefield. those woods are looking so beautiful at night. i can only imagine that it was a beautiful night to walk in. Layla as the attention seeker she was immediately agreed to the offer. 






and that night on 9:30pm Theo and Layla walked inside the woods and just talked about gods knows what. they walked for about half an hour when a car suddenly came out of nowhere and stopped next to them. my mom was in that car. she came out of the car and walked toward them. Layla freaked out and tried to run away but to no avail. my mom grabbed her by the neck and trow her to the ground and pinned her down, then she pulled a knife and stabbed her several times. meanwhile Theo just stood there to shock to react. by the time he came back to his senses it was too late. Layla was dead. 



what that happened later was quick and fast, my mom and Theo buried Layla in a place that nobody can find her, they hide the evidences and swear to never tell to a living soul what happened. and the rest came from it’s own, when Layla didn’t came back that night home her parents reported her missing. and when the police questioned my mom she told them that Layla expressed that she is planning to run away and told her that she is in love with a boy that she didn’t mention his name. when Theo was questioning he told how there was always rivalry between Megan and Layla,and that was enough for the police to blame Megan. and when Megan didn’t have an alibi it was done. Megan was convicted with the murder of Layla. a body was never found. and the police came with the story of a love triangle between Layla and Megan and that boy that they never identified and how that was the motive to the murder. our town was in shock to say the least. but after several months we slowly came back to be the town that nothing ever happened here. 





as for my mom and Mr. McLean they continue to be together. so yes, Mr. McLean is my dad. couple years ago he died because natural causes that was kind of a shock due to the fact that he was healthy. now I don’t think anymore that he died just like that. because you see, my mom isn’t a person that forgives so fast and I don’t think that it’s coincidence that he died in 21 of march.
