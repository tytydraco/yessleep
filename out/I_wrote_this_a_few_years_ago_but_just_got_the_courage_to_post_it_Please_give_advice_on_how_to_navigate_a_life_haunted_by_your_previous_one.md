 

Please forgive me as I’ve never written before, I just need advice. 

My name is Drew. I’ll leave out my last name for privacy’s sake, but I will say that I’m currently 17 years old. Ever since I was born, I’ve had the inability to feel love. No, not just romantic or sexual love. Any love. I don’t know what it’s like to have friendships or sibling connections. On top of that, I don’t feel shame or regret. To me, people are like objects. I don’t really care what happens to them, or what they think of me. 

That brings me to my predicament.  

I know it sounds unbelievable, but I swear what I’m saying is true-  I remember my past life completely, and I was the same person I am now. As if I was reincarnated or something. I look the same and have the same preferences. I still can’t handle loud noises, and I still don’t feel anything towards people. Not that I don’t have emotions, I still get happy and sad, angry and excited- emotions everyone feels. I enjoy my hobbies- just not other people. I hope you understand. 

I have no idea what to do about my new life, especially with how shocking it’s become. You’ll need to hear the full story before you give advice, if you choose to do so. 

Looking back, my past life wasn’t exactly desirable. My parents fought all the time and although they denied it, I knew it was about me. They worried about my violent outbursts, how I came before everyone else in my own mind. I often took my narcissism to the extreme- If I wanted someone to stop humming, I would hit or kick them until they stopped. It was the easiest, most efficient way. From my viewpoint, it was the natural thing to do. My parents were worried I would kill someone. Fair. 

I went to psychologists many times a year, took medicine, saw therapists, all that. I was taught about love, about kindness and pity. My parents didn’t want me to hurt people, but they couldn’t care less about me. In their eyes, I was a lost cause. I was just something people had to be careful around, something to be “handled." Honestly, they should have been more careful. 

My parents loved me, and they made sure I knew that. Unfortunately, I didn’t care and still don’t.  Some people bother me less than others sure, and I definitely hate some people, but I’ve never loved anyone.   

Since I had no relationships, I had to entertain myself. Usually this was through puzzle toys, homework, and various boring crafts. Until I met Addison. 

Addison Grey was in my class. He had long ginger hair and the prettiest green eyes I’ve ever seen in my life- or- lives. He would always joke around and go out of his way to be kind to others. One day my noise-cancelling headphones broke, and he put them back together with duct tape. I know the entire school had been warned about me, so I couldn’t understand why he interacted with me at all, much less be kind. I didn’t understand and I still don’t. 

Either way, he was always so nice to me and never shied away due to my odd behavior. I regret killing him. But not in a morality sense, it just caused trouble for me down the road. I don’t like to be inconvenienced.  

My hobbies had begun to bore me when I had the idea to kill Addison. Why? I couldn’t tell you. It just seemed kind of fun, and I wanted to see if I could get away with it. I stalked him pretty heavily for a few months, and that was by far the best part. I wanted to learn everything about him before he was gone. 

I followed him home, took photos of him, stole his things, and made list upon list of information. It was exciting to see if he would catch me. He never did. He did get close to finding me a few times though, almost opening his bathroom cabinet or by dropping his phone under the bed.  

I even made one of those stalker boards. You know, the ones with the red string? I loved making that. It was fun and made me smile. All this information under my fingertips. His schedule, his family, his favorite colors, how he pretends to be self-assured when all he sees in himself is failure. I knew everything. I loved Addison as much as I was able to (not at all) but he still felt special to me. It felt like I owned him. I knew Addison so well, I might as well have been the god that created him. Addison consumed my life.  

Then the day had come to destroy what I knew so well. I carried a handgun to school and shot Addison Grey in the hall. Yeah, there were people there- but I was wearing a mask, so I figured no one would know who did it. No one except Addison. I saw a flicker of recognition in his eyes right before I pulled the trigger, and one of those beautiful green eyes was blown apart. 

My attempt to run was thwarted by a faculty member, who tackled me to the ground and pinned me until the police arrived. They asked me a lot of questions at the station. Questions like- 

Do I regret it? No.  

Do I feel remorse? No. 

Do I understand what I did? Yes. 

Why did I do it? I was bored. 

Would I do it again? Probably.  

I was put into a mental facility instead of jail since my parents plead insanity and won. They had bought in my psychologists and doctors to vouch for them, and the jury decided I was clinically insane. 

After a few months of extreme boredom, I killed myself. I won’t go into detail. 

That brings you up to date to my reincarnation. At least that’s what I’m calling it. 

I woke up in the middle of the woods, an angel standing before me. Now, I wasn’t religious before and I don’t really consider myself a Christian now, but this was an angel. Heavenly glow, white wings, the guy had it all. 

He introduced himself as Nikolai and said I was being given “another chance.”  He said that I would like my new family, who were also being given a new shot at life.  

I thanked him for my second chance. Prison was boring and I was glad I was out. I sat up, and he briefed me on my new family, the family I’m living with as I write this. 

They’re the Wolfes, nicknamed “The Wolves.” Nikolai said I would fit right in, as the Wolfes kill people for a living. They “kill bad people who aren’t given the proper punishment by the government.“ 

Obviously, I was a little surprised to hear this. I didn’t think an angel would condone this sort of behavior, but he said that they were doing the right thing. He said I would love them, and while he’s wrong about love, I did end up tolerating my family. They don’t bother me when I want to be left alone, and they make sure my headphones are working properly. They’re nice, and I find their last name ridiculous. A win-win for me. 

Nikolai told me their names. My siblings- Anna, Emma, Addison, Ethan. And my dad- Charlie. He told me that Emma and Anna were twins- both 16. Ethan was 15 and Addison was 17. He didn’t tell me how old my dad was but looking back I imagine he was about 28 or 29 at the time. The name Addison was funny to me, he was my age and I enjoyed the irony.  

After Nikolai explained the details- my family knew I was arriving, I didn’t have to pay anything, I had my own room, blah blah blah- I got to meet “The Wolves”. He walked me down a narrow forest path until we reached a large house. A mansion, even. It wasn’t fancy or anything- in fact, it was dilapidated and abandoned-looking. There was a rusty pickup truck in the front, red paint chipping away and one window broken. I smelled the strong odor of cow and soon realized that there was a large farm behind the house.  

You might be wondering why I’m writing and posting this. Honestly, I need advice. I don’t know what to do. I like my family yes, and honestly it’s not the reincarnation thing I’m freaked out about. I’m writing because when Nikolai disappeared and I knocked on the door, Addison Grey answered.
