We got to the camp site at about 5. Normally, during the last part of March, this would mean that there would be about 3 hours of light left, give or take. But we were in a canyon, and Joey estimated that it would be fully dark around 7. So while I focused on unpacking the tent and sleeping gear, he hurried to get a fire going so we could eat before the shortened twilight fully ended.

Halley, our daughter, came bounding out of the car, complaining about the lack of internet. “We warned you before we left. Look around, there’s nothing here. That’s why Mom downloaded shows for you,” Joey said with only slight exasperation. “Come on, help me collect fire wood.”

“Oh, yeah. I forgot.” Halley was 7, but just barely. Her blonde hair had a slight curl and her blue eyes were still baby-bright by, despite every nurse swearing that the eye color would change as she aged.

While they wandered away, I unloaded and sorted everything we had brought, and made a mental note of everything we forgot. Bread was the big one. So much for sandwiches for lunch. By the time Joey and Halley came back, I was setting up the tent. Halley helped hold the first pole so I could put up the next, then much to her chagrin, I had her blow up the mattresses. Which made me laugh. We had a hand-held blower with us; when I was her age, I had to use my lungs.

There were three other groups camping around us, but the sites were so far removed from one another we could only just hear that one was playing music, and the closest one had a dog barking. The other one, the farthest one, we only knew they were there because the entire campground could be seen as we drove in.

“Momma, there’s a river!” Halley was practically bouncing. “Can I go swimming? I didn’t pack a swimsuit.”

“That’s snowmelt. It’s going to be extremely cold,” Joey said in his typical matter-of-fact tone.

“You can dip your toes in,” I said, “ it’s one of the reasons we picked this spot.”

After dinner was eaten and cleaned, we got into the tent to settle in for the night. Halley put on an episode of The Magic School Bus, the old school version, since the remake “creeped her out”.  After that, I read a chapter of one of her horse stories. Joey was asleep before the episode was done, and Halley was out about half way through the chapter. I appreciated the moment of quiet and no one demanding my attention. The tent had no roof so I was able to watch the night sky, and there was a gentle breeze that made the reeds next to the river rustle pleasantly.

The next morning we woke up with the sun. Joey began another fire for breakfast, while I used our mini-fire stove to heat water. Halley woke up and immediately complained that the battery was dead on the tablet she used to watch her shows. I rolled my eyes at her, which elicited her rolling eyes back at me. “Your electronics are your responsibility,” I said with no small hint of irritation in my voice (I am not a morning person) as I plugged her tablet into the generator we brought, you know, for the necessities.

“Oh, yeah, I forgot.”

After breakfast, we headed out for a day of hiking. Once I had found the campsite, Joey had done more research and found that a short drive away was a trailhead to some natural springs.

Three miles in, I realized we had greatly underpacked for a day in the sun. I had only brought 3 granola bars, Halley had about the same in her pack, and Joey had one, and a bag of beef jerky that was so hot only he could stand to eat it. But the trail was only supposed to be 5 miles, so we each had a granola bar and continued on.

But 5 miles came and went according to both mine and Joey’s watches. 7 miles. 10 miles, and still no end in sight. I suggested we stop there, go off trail to hit the creek which the trail stayed close to the entire way, and decide what to do next. I knew Joey wanted to keep going, but he was also getting upset by the heat of the day and confused that we weren’t to the end of the trail yet.

Halley got to play in the creek, and Joey and I brought up the maps we each had of the area. I had snapped a picture of the map at the trailhead, but Joey had saved a satellite image when he was researching. None of it made sense.

On the map from the trailhead, there wasn’t any other trails we could have gotten mixed up with. It was literally the only trail on the map. And it was more or less a straight line from the parking lot to the springs. Some wiggles, but that was it.

The satellite images showed essentially the same thing, but there was enough detail we could take a guess at where we had already been, and where we were. “Look, I’m pretty sure that bend there” Joey pointed down the creek, “is that bend here,” he pointed at his phone.

“That doesn’t make any sense. That’s just a little ways from the parking lot. If that’s 10 miles, look at how much farther we have to do before we get to the springs.” If Joey was right, we had maybe made it a fifth of the way. “Did we both misread something? Is it a 50 mile hike?”

“No,” Joey shook his head but still looked more confused than certain, “look, the scale is right there.” And it was, in the bottom right corner of the screen was a scale. 

“Could the scale be wrong?” I was grasping at straws, and we both knew it.

“By a factor of 10? Besides the trailhead said the same thing, 4.8 miles.” Joey adjusted his position.

“I’d ask if our watches could be wrong, but I can tell you my feet have definitely walked 10 miles. And it looks like you’re feeling the same way.” I looked at Halley playing in the creek. “At least she’s too young to have any idea that she should be feeling half dead by now. But how are we going to hike back?”

He stood up and stretched his back. “Let’s fill up our water.” He squinted in the direction of the sun. “We need to head back. The sun is going to set before we get back to the car at this point.”

As we started hiking back, I was overcome with the idea that we would never make it back. We were stuck on this god-forsaken path for the rest of eternity. I’d watch my daughter die from the elements and starvation. I’d probably die at Joey’s hand after I say something specifically to press his buttons. Maybe we’d just live long lives eating bark and drinking whatever diseases are in the creek.

But then I realized that we were hitting all of the same landmarks I remembered seeing coming in. If anything, they were coming quicker than felt right. “My watch is dying” I announced after we passed the rock that looked like a melted bird, according to Halley.

“Yeah, mine too. Where are you at?”

“It just buzzed to tell me it’s at 10%. 2 miles. 2:34.”

Joey laughed at my info dump, “I just meant the percentage. I’m at 15. But I can confirm I also have 2 miles since we started back.”

After 2 more miles, we started hearing rustling in the trees. After half a mile more, Halley said she needed to stop. “My feet feel like they’re on fire! I’m dead!”

“We can stop and rest here, but we can’t just stop Halley, what are we going to do? Sleep here?” Joey waved his arms around.

Halley laughed. “Ok, daddy. But my feet really do hurt. How much longer to the car?”

“Well, we hiked 10 miles to the creek, we’ve hiked 4 miles back. How much more do we have?” I asked after sitting with a groan.

“Like, 12?”

I leaned back, lying face up with my arm over my eyes. “It’s 10 minus 4, Halley.”

“Oh, yeah, I forgot.”

After taking enough time to drink and everyone eating the last granola bar, we started again. After a little bit, the trees started rustling again. Then, suddenly Joey yelped and fell to the ground.

“I think I twisted my ankle on a stupid rock or something,” he said behind gritted teeth. Halley began hyperventilating in panic while I kneeled beside him. “Just give me a minute to get over the pain and I’ll be good to go.”

I gingerly squeezed around his ankle, until I felt something wet. Lifting his leg for a better look, I saw the two tell-tale holes which told me he did not twist his anIke.

“I swear to god, if you die from a snake bite on this hike that never ends, I’m divorcing you.” I began digging through my pack, then his. “Wait, where’s our first aid kit?”

“It should be at the bottom of my pack.” Joey was already washing the wound with water from his bottle. “I didn’t even see a snake. You think it’s a fun one? Will I start hallucinating?”

“Oh my god. Shut up.”

“Is Daddy going to die?” Halley was practically screeching in her panic.

“No. He’s not rich enough yet.” Halley gave me an inquisitive look for a second, and then acceptance washed the panic from her face.

“We have nothing to wrap you up with. What piece of clothing do you want me to rip up?” I fingered my tank top. It wasn’t the worst option. But I was also not wearing a bra, so if I had to use more than a strip, things would get inappropriate once we got back to civilization. Assuming we did make it back.

“I don’t think we need to destroy clothes yet.” Joey stood up and took a tender step, then walked off with only a slight limp.

After another mile, Joey was struggling. I put his arm over my shoulder and he took the opportunity to take the weight off his bit leg. I told myself I could do this for 5 more miles, but I wasn’t sure I believed it.

Another half a mile from there, Joey collapsed. Halley began to panic again, but I didn’t have the bandwidth to deal with her, so I just ignored her quick-fire questions. Joey was unconscious but breathing, and I didn’t know what to do.

After taking a moment, I realized there was a patch of shade just a bit father on the trail, so I dragged Joeys body to it. Halley did her best to help, but she was only 7, so there wasn’t much she could contribute.  After getting into the shade, I checked the bite site. It was oozing a yellow-green pus and smelled like rancid meat. I flushed it as best I could with what little water Joey and I had left, I wanted Halley to keep her water for the rest of the hike. Four more miles, I realized. How was I going to do this?

The rustling of the trees increased, and I realized all the animal sounds had gone silent. I shook my head up to the sky. If a bear came, what was I going to do? Maybe it would just eat all three of us and then I wouldn’t have to worry about any of it anymore. The rustling grew closer and I was getting ready to push Halley in front of me and yell at her to run as fast as she could to the car, a body tumbled out of the brush.

She looked to be mid-20’s. Her long hair was tangled with twigs and dead leaves, and her face was streaked with dirt and tears. “Oh my god!” Her hands covered her face as she sobbed a few times. “I’ve been lost for days. I-I was trying to find the springs, but I must have gotten lost, and then I tried to follow the creek so that I’d be close to water, but it’s taken me days, I don’t even know how many.”

I blinked a few times at her, my heart still deciding whether this was a fight or flight situation, before starting to explain our own experience on the trail. “So, if you are physically capable of helping me carry my husband, I’m estimating we’re about 4 miles from the trailhead.”

The young woman nodded eagerly, and we worked together to get Joey up enough to carry him. Despite the day, Halley has never yet met a stranger, so she was back to bouncing and asking a million questions.

Around the next bend of the trail, I was pretty sure I recognized the twisted tree as being the one just down from the trailhead. It didn’t make sense. But then, as we moved closer, I could see our car. We had made it. Somehow. And it wasn’t even dark yet.

The woman, whose name was Jennifer, helped me load Joey into the back. Halley buckled herself into her car seat, and I started the car. “I have to get to the hospital. Where is your car? I can probably take you.”

Jennifer shrugged. “I didn’t drive.”

That made me raise an eyebrow, but I only had so much energy to spare. “Well, you should probably get checked out anyway. Get in, we’ll take you to the hospital too.” She did as requested and we were off.

The trip to the hospital was uneventful and completely lacking in any of the weirdness that had marked the rest of the day. Once I spoke to the nurse at the front desk, Joey was rushed in and behind swinging doors I was told not to follow. Jennifer was also taken away for her own inspection. That left Halley and me to sit in the waiting room. There was a tv on, playing Sponge Bob Square Pants, so she was entertained, which left me alone with my thoughts. Normally, that wouldn’t be a problem, but I just could not make sense of the day.

It wasn’t long before a nurse brought bottled waters out to us, and then not long after that when another nurse came to give me an update on Joey. Then the police showed up. Jennifer had been missing for months, not days, and that wasn’t the only part of her story that didn’t add up. She had gone hiking with a group of friends, including her fiancé. All of them were still missing as well. But she didn’t remember going with anyone.  When she explained the area she had hiked, the police couldn’t figure out how she had spent days, let alone months, without getting back to the trailhead or at the very least running into another hiker. If the map showed my family having gone a mile, she had gone half.

None of it made sense.

In the ensuing hours, waiting for news about Joey, Jennifer’s parents came and took her home. We exchanged pleasantries, and they offered to UberEats anything I wanted. I accepted, because the last thing I ate were campfire scrambled eggs nearly 12 hours previously. Halley just wanted a hotdog and chocolate milk.

Once the hospital waiting room was once again empty, and our tummies were full, Halley curled up in one of the chairs in a way only a child can, and went to sleep. I could feel the exhaustion in my own body, but anxiety kept sleep at bay.

I walked to the front desk. “Sorry to bother you, I know you’ll let me know when you have news, but can you tell me what’s going on with Joey?”

“Who, hun?” The nurse behind the desk was a heavy-set elderly lady, and her soft southern accent was just barely there, but comforting.

“My husband? Joesph Peppers? I brought him in with a snake bite?” I was so tired. Did he have a snake bite? Was it a broken bone? Dehydration? I couldn’t remember.

“Hun, there’s nobody here. We haven’t had anyone come in with a snake bite.”

“What? That’s not possible, what do you think I’m doing here then?”

“I thought I was alone, I didn’t know anyone was here. What’s your name hun?”

“No, I’ve been here for at least two hours. I brought in Jennifer and Joey at the same time. I-I don’t understand.”

“Your names Jennifer, dear? What’s your last name?”

“What? No, my names Amber, Amber Peppers. I brought in Jennifer. She was the girl lost for months.” What was going on? None of this made sense. My anxiety was raising to panic and I suddenly needed to make sure that Halley was still with me. I turned away from the front desk to check the waiting room, but the nurse came from behind and stood in front of me.

“Now, dear, I don’t know where you think you’re going, but I’m going to need to have you talk to some friends of mine. Don’t you worry none, though.” She smiled sweetly enough and she moved her arm around me in what was probably a friendly enough gesture, but since she was standing between my daughter and myself, I pushed her away.

I took a step into the waiting room and almost cried. Halley was still curled up sleeping. I picked her up and held her as I turned around to face the nurse. Whatever else was going to happen, I was going to make sure Halley was with me.

The nurse still wore a friendly smile, but the other two people behind her looked more concerned. “Miss Peppers,” the nurse said slowly, “you’re in shock. Please come with us.” The taller of the two men reached out to take Halley, but I turned so that I kept my body between them and her.

“It’s ok, dear, just come with us.” The nurse was still talking in that slow manner. As long as they didn’t try to take Halley, I nodded and followed them. What did she mean shock?

I followed them to a dark room, where the lead nurse told me I could lay down on the bed, and they’d just take my heart beat, and blood pressure, and not to worry about any of it. My thinking was mush; I was just too tired to fight anymore, except making sure Halley stayed next to me. She had awoken briefly, but was already back asleep.

The morning light broke through the blinds and I tried to cover my eyes with one hand, but it had a wire coming from it, and my arms hurt. I sat up with a jolt when I realized Halley wasn’t next to me. I tried tearing out the wire from my hand, but that set off an alarm.

A nurse hurried in and calmly turned off the alarm while she said “Ah, Amber, you’re awake! Halley is watching tv in the next room, she didn’t want to bother you, and we’re having a slow day.”

“Joey?” My throat was sore, my mouth was dry, and my body hurt, but I knew it was weird she only told me about my kid that didn’t have a medical emergency.

“Oh, Joseph is in the room across the hall. He was touch and go for a while there, but the doctor thinks he got the anti-venom in time and will make a full recovery.”

“But last night… the nurse…” my memory was foggy. What had happened last night? “Didn’t someone say he was dead? Or didn’t come to the hospital? It didn’t make sense.”

“Oh, dear me. You were in shock. We should have caught it sooner, we’re the professionals after all. But after Jennifer was released, you started talking gibberish. And no one knew what you were trying to say, but you wouldn’t let anyone touch your girl. But then somehow Nurse Jessie convinced you to come to this room and we were able to treat you for shock.”

“Oh, wow. I’m so sorry.” I could feel the blush burning my face. “Can I see Joey? Or Halley?”

“Of course, and don’t think of it, you can’t hold it against yourself.” The nurse removed the tube from my hand, and I was free to move at my own volition again. 

I first went to Halley’s room. She was sitting in the hospital bed eating a bag of chips, watching some cartoon I didn’t recognize. I looked at my watch and remembered it was dead. “It’s a little early for potato chips, isn’t it?” I asked.

“Mom, it’s like, 3 in the afternoon.” I looked at the nurse who shrugged and smiled while she nodded in agreement. I had lost an entire day?

I shuffled to Joeys room. My muscles wanted rest after hiking 20 miles yesterday. Except maybe it wasn’t 20 miles? Whatever it was, it was close to my physical limit. Joeys room was dark, but I could hear him breathing. Well, snoring. I went to his bedside and stroked his face gently.

His hand reached for mine and he smiled at me. “Definitely not a fun snake bite. No hallucinations at all.”

“I’m not sure there’s any snakes that cause hallucinations.” I smiled back at him and did my best not to break into tears.  “I’ll get you some mushrooms or peyote something if it’s that important to you.”

He laughed gently. “Nah, you’re all the spirit vision I need.”

Once we were all released from the hospital, we still needed to go back to our campsite and pack it up so we could go home. Joey was mostly back to normal, but the poison would make his joints feel like they were on fire. He moved a little slower, and he wore out faster.

Halley was no worse for wear. The gift of childhood.

As we finished packing the last of the gear, I looked up and saw a person standing in front of our car. The sun was behind them, allowing me to only see a silhouette, but the shape was familiar.

“Jennifer?” I called out, trying to shade my eyes from the sun with my arm.

“Hey stranger, sorry to burst in on you like this. I was just in the area and wanted to say thank you, again. I wouldn’t be here without your help.” Her smile was bright, her hair brushed and shiny, and her clothes were fresh. It looked like she had just walked out of her house to stand in front of us.

“Well, I don’t know what I would have done without you. I was so turned around, I probably would have dragged my husband around in circles.” I took her outstretched hand to shake, then turned at introduced her to Joey, who also shook her hand. She offered to help with the last few things we needed to load, and it was finished quickly.

Joey looked around. “Didn’t you drive here? It’s a ways to walk from any of the other trails around here.”

“I didn’t drive,” she said with a shrug.

“Well, get in, we’ll take you to wherever you need to go,” I volunteered, and Joey nodded in agreement.

“Oh, you guys are too kind, but I’m good. I’ll just go the way I came.”

Joey shook his head. “Don’t be silly. This place is too easy to get lost in. Come on; we’ll give you a ride.”

Jennifer’s smile became almost inhumanly wide. “Thank you, both of you. I will not forget your repeated kindness.”

I shook my head with a small laugh, “Really, you saved my husband’s life, a ride out of the campground is hardly the kindness I owe you.”

Jennifer merely nodded and got into the car. “Where am I taking you?” Joey asked once we got moving. “Did you come back here to hike again already?”

Jennifer laughed, “no, I think my hiking days are done for the time being. Which way are you guys headed? Would the Walmart in town be out of your way?”

“Nope, right on our way.”

It took a little over an hour to get back to civilization, and then another half hour to get to the Walmart. We passed the time in the car in friendly conversation and listening to the radio. It wasn’t until after we had left Jennifer at the entrance of the store that I thought to wonder how Jennifer had found us. How would she have gotten to the campsite on foot, and how could she have known we would be there anyway?

It didn’t make any sense.

Our lives went on, back to normal. Joey still had a random flare in his joints that reminded him he almost died. I sometimes woke up in a panic, thinking someone has stolen Joey or Halley. And Halley talked about her new best friend, Jennifer. Kids are weird though. Jennifer became a pretty monster from the forest that eats people’s insides and wears their skin. Except for Mommy and Daddy because they saved Jennifer before she fully became a monster all the way. Now the monster is our friend and will save us whenever we need help.

“But,” I said, “she saved Daddy, so really we’re even. So I don’t think Jennifer is going to save us again. That wouldn’t make any sense.”

“Oh, yeah, I forgot.”
