I thought that when Eric died, my life couldn't get any worse. I was wrong.

My brother was 17 years old when he died to a freak car accident caused by a drunk driver. Eric wasn’t a great guy but aside from his many flaws, he seemed to really care about me. Between the sly remarks and the dead-legs, he would tell me that he was proud of how well I was doing in school. When our stepdad had a couple too many beers, Eric kept me out of the proverbial lion's den and often threw himself into those gnashing jaws. He dabbled in some drug use and loved to fight but he wasn't a bully; not really. Hell, Eric wasn't perfect but I looked up to him. I loved him and wanted him to be around forever. 

We were driving home from the local Dairy Freeze, eating ice cream, joking around, and blaring ACDC’s Highway To Hell when it happened. The winding road was lined with forest on either side and dipped down into a valley. We were climbing the hill, back out of the valley, when a van came careening over the peak. Eric was doing his best Bon Scott impression as I saw it. 

My voice wasn't working. I tried to speak but the shock was overwhelming. I saw it. I could have pulled the wheel, I could have screamed, I could have pointed, anything. Instead, I closed my eyes and braced for impact.

When I woke up, I felt like I'd crash landed out of orbit. My muscles screamed and I couldn't open my eyes. Someone was putting pressure on my leg, making it feel like the bone was in a thousand pieces. 

“... And tell them to land the bird just past -redacted-. This one still has vitals. They're weak but they're definitely there.”... “No, just one. Fuck me, Weathers, why'd they have to be kids?”

An EMT? I didn't understand for a moment but then I remembered the van. It all came crashing in like a tsunami. I tried to move but wasn't able to. I was strapped to a gurney. I tried opening my eyes again and realized that I could if not for my battered and swollen face. I was anxious and scared. I tried to speak but all I could muster was a measly, “Eric?” before passing out to the steady beat of helicopter blades. 

Eric was dead.

I half-sat, half-laid in the hospital bed staring at the tile ceiling. I looked over at the digital clock on my bedside table. The red numbers flashed consistently. It was almost hypnotic.

On. Off. On. Off. 2:55. On. Off. On. Off. 2:56. On. Off. On. Off. 

I sighed and closed my eyes. I wasn't going to be able to sleep. I laid in relative silence and mourned my brother. I blamed myself for not reacting, for freezing up and watching the horror unfold. I saw the van coming over the hill over and over. 

I went to glance at the clock again as it flashed 3:00am and my heart jumped into my throat. 

Eric sat in the chair, staring directly into my eyes. The steady flash of the clock lit up his face with an ominous red glow. A huge gash stretched down his face from brow to jaw. His top lip was all but gone, smeared into a sickening cleft, I could see his top teeth which were chipped and missing. With each pulse, I took in more. The blood. The bruises. The bone sticking through his forearm. The dead look in his dreary grey eyes..

The droning light flashed on and off as Eric looked down at himself. 

With raspy, garbled, speech he managed to piece together the words, “Look at me…”

The red glow died out and when it flashed back on, Eric was gone.

Weeks went by but I couldn't get the hellish vision out of my head. I sat in my geometry class, bombarded by the ghostly sight of my brother and the van that had ruined my life. I tried to focus on what my teacher was saying but it didn't matter. I couldn't focus on anything until I heard the snickering.

Incessant, lowly, snickers came from the same direction of the eyes that bore into the back of my skull. I looked in the direction of the perpetrators, trying not to make eye contact.

My next class came and went about as quickly as frozen molasses. I rushed to my locker, attempting to avoid the other students. I shoved the necessary books in and slammed the door shut. 

Eric’s face was inches away from mine. I screamed and fell backwards, landing on my ass with a solid thud. My brother’s visage looked down at me with a look of reckoning.

I heard the snickers again and focused on the source. Two guys watched me and laughed amongst themselves, pointing, doubled over. The bigger of the two wheezed out, “What's wrong with you, you pussy?”

In that instant, his eyes rolled back as his head jerked to the left with a sickening crack. A small amount of blood trickled down his chin as he dropped to the floor. I stared in horror, completely taken aback. The smaller guy dropped to his knees in hysterics, shaking his friend. He looked back and forth between the two of us with a look of total shock, screaming accusations. I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came out.

I was focused on the execution that just happened before me when I heard Eric growl, “Look at me.”

I ripped myself from the terrible scene to see Eric standing above me. He glared down with a look of dead rage, twitching and trembling. 

My head lolled back to the scene in a daze to see students and faculty gathering in a group. Wails and screams of horror emanated from the crowd as they discovered the body. I took a shaky breath before breaking down in tears myself. 

Eric would show up pretty often over the years. Most of the time it was uneventful and harmless but yesterday, he went too far. 

My mom and stepdad got into a fight. I was visiting for dinner when I overheard the arguing. From the kitchen, I heard harsh hushed whispers, followed by a gut wrenching slap. I stood from the table and quickly rounded the corner to see my mom staring at the floor, holding the side of her face.

I demanded that Terry stop while advancing on him. As I got close, yelling obscenely, he struck out with a fist and connected on my jaw. I stumbled backward into my mom; our feet tangled and she fell to the ground. My step dad grabbed me by the collar. I felt the spittle as he screamed at me, “Understand that I will fuck you up. You ever threaten me again and I'll kill y-” 

His jaw wrenched down, spluttering with a tremendous snap. Blood splattered my face; mouth gaped open in horror. He released me, hands fumbling, as his jaw slacked off and slapped onto the tile floor. His eyes rolled back and he gripped his throat while stepping away from me.

Eric stood off to my side, shaking and grunting. He glowered at Terry and growled in a disturbingly demonic rasp, “LOOK AT ME!”

Gasping one labored breath, his face turned purple and his eyes bulged as they rolled back forward, pinned on Eric.

My mother started screaming and thrashing my shoulder. I stared in horror as I felt bile creep up my throat. I shuddered and turned to her as she flew back and crashed into the cabinets, crumpling over.

I begged for Eric to stop, tears streaming down my face. My mother screamed as I fumbled over to her. She cried and pleaded with me as I held her and apologized. I sobbed and hugged her, trying to give assurance that everything would be okay: That's when her ribs cracked and caved in. She gagged as a spray of red burst from her mouth.

I'm writing this from my phone while I sit in my car on a back road. I had to leave because I know what this looks like. I'm not stupid. I really can't take this. I did not kill my parents.
