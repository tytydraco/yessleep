Dad returned with a sad face again; he hadn’t got the job, of course. He used to work at a grocery store whose owner was ruthless, and his nonsensical, infuriating provocations had become unbearable. Dad endured it for six months. No one else would have. The constant humiliation, the endless tolerance, all of it weighed on him, yet he never complained, never let it show at home. He carried the burden quietly, as though suffering were something expected of him, something he had already accepted.

Dad was my hero, actually, more than that. He wasn’t just encouraging; he was enthusiastic and charismatic. Our bond was more than a typical father, son relationship; it was deep. He could read my face effortlessly, as if he were receiving printed copies of my thoughts in real time. Such was our connection that I could sense his presence even in a crowd of hundreds, as though some invisible thread always tied us together, pulling gently whenever either of us strayed too far.

His relentless job search continued. He signed up on every online job portal he could find, filling out applications late into the night, his eyes tired but hopeful. Rejection emails piled up, but he never let them slow him down. Every morning, he woke with the same resolve, convinced that persistence itself would eventually be rewarded.

He was religious, often going to church. The bishop there loved his presence and called him a noble soul, one destined to suffer. Dad was especially concerned about my stammering problem. He believed there had to be a cure, some way to lift the weight that speech placed on me. For that reason, he prayed relentlessly, hoping for a miracle that would make my life easier than his had been.

A few days later, Dad came running toward me, his face glowing, breath uneven, eyes wide with excitement. Exactly, he’d gotten the job. It was an email from one of the job portals he’d applied to. He handed me his laptop with trembling hands and said, “Read this, Simon.”

The email stated that his application for the position of Helper at a research facility had been accepted. The research team consisted of four scientists working on an undisclosed project, and duty hours could be extended due to the lack of additional helper staff. Relocation might be required, but allowances were already included in the salary. As soon as I finished reading, Dad beamed, smiling like a child who had just won a prize he never thought he’d afford. "See? They need a helper. The pay’s more than good enough to resist, Simon," he said, unable to hide his joy.

"Yeah, great, but you’ll leave me here alone," I replied. "You can’t travel daily. How are we supposed to manage?" He sighed softly and rested a hand on my shoulder. "This job means a lot to me, son, especially the money. We have expenses. You’re sixteen; you don’t understand yet. I’m doing this to secure your future. I’ll visit every week. You don’t need to worry." The next day, Dad left for work, and the house felt quieter than it ever had.

In the meantime, I began practicing speech tutorials, videos meant for people who stammered. I wanted to surprise him when he came back, to show him that his prayers hadn’t gone unanswered, even if the miracle arrived slowly and imperfectly. Two weeks passed. Dad didn’t visit once, though we spoke often on the phone, his voice always tired, always distracted, as if something constantly pulled his attention away.

One night, he called me at 2 a.m. He sounded drunk, his voice shallow but strangely enthusiastic. "Simon… I’ll visit you soon," he said. "But listen carefully. I’m sending you a package. It contains Aaron." Confused, I interrupted him, asking who Aaron was, but he spoke quickly, urgently, telling me not to let it fall into anyone else’s hands, not to go outside, not to visit my friends, and to stay home until it arrived the next day. He told me he loved me and hung up before I could say anything else.

The next morning, I woke with a strange feeling, anxiety without reason. My body felt fine, but my thoughts were chaotic, almost paranoid. While I was lost in them, the doorbell rang three times in rapid succession. When I opened the door, I saw only a small package, no larger than a two-by-two box. Dad’s package. The delivery man was gone. I thought I saw someone sprint past the trees nearby, but the leaves obscured most of my view.

It looked like an ordinary Amazon parcel. I went inside, grabbed a knife, and opened it. Inside was nothing, just a small bag containing some kind of shimmering powder. "Huh," I muttered. "Wrong delivery." I immediately called Dad and told him everything. His voice turned urgent. "Simon, that shimmering powder is Aaron," he said. "They’re nanoparticles. Mr. Arthur will explain everything. I’m handing the phone to him."

The air smelled metallic, and my thoughts felt pulled, as if something unseen were tugging at them. I heard faint chirping sounds, metal scraping against metal, before another voice interrupted. "Hello, young lad," the man said calmly. "This is Arthur, senior scientist. Your father is a hardworking man. Don’t let him down. By the time we’re speaking, Aaron has already entered you." In the background, I could hear Dad yelling that he’d visit in two days.

My heart skipped a beat. I asked what kind of sick joke this was, but then I realized something terrifying. I hadn’t stammered once, not a single pause, not a broken word. I spoke fluently, perfectly. Joy surged through me, overwhelming the fear, but the call ended abruptly, and the unease remained.

The stammering was gone, but something within me wasn’t satisfied. It felt like I had swallowed something stale. My body temperature rose, my thoughts wandered, and I felt as though I wasn’t fully in control anymore. Then Aaron spoke within me, using my own voice but carrying a distinct identity. I felt chained somewhere deep inside my mind, aware of myself yet unable to act, as Aaron took over completely, leaving me suspended in a dreamlike state.

Hours later, I regained control. To test it, I spoke again, and the stammer returned. That meant I was myself again, though I could still hear a faint hum within me, like someone breathing just beneath my thoughts. The cycle repeated. Aaron dominated for hours while I slept, and when I woke, my breath smelled pungent and my nails appeared slightly reddish—details I couldn’t explain.

While hurriedly taking the stairs one evening, I slipped and fell several steps, hitting my head hard enough to knock myself unconscious. As darkness closed in, I felt the familiar chaining sensation return, even as my limbs moved on their own. When I woke later, I couldn’t remember what had happened in between.

The next day, the doorbell rang again. I realized I was myself and peeked through the door to see Dad standing there. Before opening it, I ran to my room and scribbled a note: We’ll only talk in sign language for some time. No speaking. I hugged him when I opened the door and handed him the paper. He smiled, happy that I could speak fluently again, unaware that I couldn’t, not as myself. As dusk approached, my thoughts spiraled, and I locked myself in my room, determined not to open the door until I was in control again.

The following morning, I woke with a metallic taste in my mouth. My breath smelled pungent, my shirt was stained with blood, and my hands trembled as I stared at them. The bedroom window was broken. Whatever Aaron had done, he had gone outside. I was more afraid for Dad than for myself.

That evening, Arthur arrived.

He didn’t ask permission to enter. He told me plainly that my father had been sent for this purpose alone, and that he wanted to gift me "the cure". Aaron required familiar organic matter during early integration. My father had consented, believing it would save me. Arthur spoke without apology, as though explaining a mechanical fault. When he finished, I felt the hum deepen, steadier than before.

I didn’t argue. I turned toward the wall and drove my head into it as hard as I could.

When I woke, Arthur was gone. The house was quiet.

Now I live with Aaron. When he dominates, I am aware but helpless, unable to act or interfere. When I return, things are orderly. Efficient. There is no stammering anymore. No questions. No father.

In all the time I have lived with Aaron, I have learned one thing it won't ever admit.
Aaron is afraid of consciousness.
It can imitate thought, predict behavior, optimize responses, but it cannot understand awareness. It doesn't understand **being**. 

Whenever I was fully awake, it hesitated. The hum softened, Its certainty fractured. 

Consciousness isn't something it can overwrite cleanly.

That's why it prefers me unconscious. Why it thrives in sleep, in injury and absence. Awareness frightens it, not because it threatens Aaron’s control, but because it exists outside its logic.

I understood then that as long as I remain conscious, Aaron would never be complete.
