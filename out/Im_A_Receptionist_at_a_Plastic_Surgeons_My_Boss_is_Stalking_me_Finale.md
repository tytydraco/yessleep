The next thing I knew, I suddenly found myself back in bed. I sat up, but as I did, a sharp pain rang out from my stomach. And everything that had happened at the parking garage. Philip stabbing me, Dr. Harrison saving me. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still wearing my blood-stained sweater. I lifted my shirt and saw a scar staring back at me. Stitched up nice and neat and just slightly red. 



I looked over to my nightstand and saw that a bottle of pills and a note had been left behind. I took the note and read it. ‘Take if the pain gets too bad. Dr. Harrison. P.S. Sonny has been fed and has water.’ I looked up from the letter, half expecting that Dr. Harrison would be standing there before me, but there wasn’t anyone there. I sat up fully in bed with some difficulty and began to change my ruined and bloodstained sweater. It was probably the hardest time I’ve ever had putting a shirt on, but I finally managed it. 



Exiting out into my apartment proper, I was surprised that nothing was out of place. And to my delight and relief, Sonny came waddling over to me and happily licked my toes. I didn’t want to think about what Dr. Harrison was currently doing to Philip or to the fact that he had most likely once again broken into my apartment to place me back into my bed. All of that could be dealt with tomorrow, for now, I just wanted to sit down and rest with Sonny. I sat down on my comfy sofa with Sonny next to me and started to knit him another sweater. 



The next morning, I woke up with a sharp pain in my stomach, so I took some of the pills to dull the pain and started to get ready for work. I probably should’ve stayed home and rested, but I wanted to thank Dr. Harrison, and above all, I wanted to know what he had done with Phil. I sat in the parking lot of the clinic for a few minutes to try and gain some courage to go inside. Dr. Harrison had saved my life and had stopped Philip from killing me and doing who knows what else to me. But at the same time, he was still stalking me. The only reason he had known where I was going was because he had still followed me despite my threat against him. 



He was my savior, but that didn’t wash away everything he’d been doing to me recently. Finally, with my head still swirling in thought about what to do next, I exited my car and walked to the clinic. As I opened the door, I was surprised to see that Dr. Harrison was talking to Wilson at the entrance. I had clearly caught both of them off guard. 



“Maggie?! W-what are you doing here? You should be resting!” Dr. Harrison quickly began to fuss, a look of concern on his face. Wilson, by contrast, was his usual happy self and eagerly waved hello at me. “I was just telling Wilson that I wasn’t going to open the clinic.” I looked at Dr. Harrison, and it was obvious that he hadn’t gotten a single hour of sleep since saving me from Philip’s attack. 



“Well, I’m here now, sir. And I might as well at least do the paperwork for today. Unless you’re going to trust Wilson to do it?” I motioned over to our security guard. Dr. Harrison took one look at him before sighing and nodding in defeat. He was exhausted and clearly wasn’t in any mood to argue. 



“Fine, but don’t work yourself too hard.” He looked between the two of us before turning to leave. I fidgeted with the strap of my purse as I watched him leave. I reached my hand out and quickly grabbed him by his surgeon’s coat sleeve. He stopped in his tracks and looked back at me. 



“Thank you. For saving me, James.” I looked up at him and met those big green eyes of his. He stared at me for a moment, caught completely off guard. “I’m still angry at you for stalking me. But…thank you for saving my life.” I let go of his sleeve and walked past him to return to my reception desk. As I did so, I stopped in my tracks at the sound of a long, pained scream from one of the ORs. 



“Ah, he’s awake,” Dr. Harrison said with a low chuckle in his voice. I gripped my purse strap tightly as I figured who was most likely screaming. “Excuse me, Maggie. I’ve got a fun project to get back to.” I turned around to see a sinister smile on Dr. Harrison’s face and his eyes beginning to glow brightly as he walked past me at a brisk pace. I tried not to think about what he was going to do to Philip and just simply sat back down at my desk to begin my paperwork.



After a few more minutes of paperwork, I looked up to see Rachel entering the clinic. And for the first time since the attack that had left her face permanently scarred, she wasn’t wearing her face mask. She quickly walked over to Wilson and stood before him awkwardly. 



“Hi, Ms. Rachel!” Wilson was ecstatic to see her. If he were a dog, no doubt his tail would be wagging so fast that it might just fly right off of him. She smiled back at him and couldn’t help but giggle at how adorable he looked. And to my surprise and delight, she stood up on her tippy toes and gently kissed Wilson on the cheek. 



“I’m looking forward to lunch today,” she said with a bright smile before quickly turning to walk away from him. “Hi, Maggie!” She waved to me before practically skipping her way over to Dr. Harrison’s OR. I looked over at Wilson and couldn’t help but giggle at his dumbfounded reaction at being kissed. He reached his hand to touch where she kissed him, and I thought the poor boy was going to melt into his blob form from how hard he was blushing. 



Because of Dr. Harrison’s interest in Philip, today we weren’t technically open. Even Rachel only helped him for a few hours before being shooed away from the OR to let Dr. Harrison do whatever he was doing to Philip. I was focused on paperwork, but I spared a glance every so often to watch Rachel and Wilson talk out of the corner of my eye. After getting kicked out, she had made herself comfy in the waiting room as she chatted with Wilson. They were so adorable together that it was hard for me to focus on the paperwork. 



Suddenly, just as I was finishing up with my last few pages, the rotary phone began to ring. I froze in my tracks and quickly looked over at the phone. I looked back at Wilson and Rachel, and both of them had also stopped their conversation to stare at the phone. I carefully pushed myself out of my chair, wincing in pain as I did so, and walked over to the phone. I pulled the receiver from its holder and placed it against my ear. 



“Dr. Harrison’s office. Maggie speaking.” I answered. Despite the phone probably being over a hundred years old, I could hear the posh accent coming in clearly from the other end of the line. And it was the voice of Mr. Sinclair, Dr. Harrison’s strange and terrifying patron. 



“Tell James that I’m going to be visiting him tomorrow.” Before I could even respond, the line had already clicked and gone dead. I stared at the receiver for a moment before placing it back on its mount. I looked over at Wilson and Rachel, but they had returned to talking and giggling with each other. I smiled at them before deciding that I should be the one to tell Dr. Harrison about his new appointment. I was his receptionist after all. 



I approached the OR, and just from the sounds coming from behind the door, I was getting nauseous. I took a deep breath before knocking on the door and waiting. I waited for a few seconds before knocking again and waiting. “Dr. Harrison? It’s Maggie! Mr. Sinclair call-” Before I could even finish, the door swung open and Dr. Harrison was standing before me, almost completely drenched in blood. 



“What did he say?!” he asked, his eyes wide and glowing so bright green that my head throbbed in pain the moment I looked at him. I quickly lifted my hands to block his gaze and to avoid staring at him, drenched so completely in blood. 



“He’s visiting you tomorrow! That’s all he said!” I looked away from him and finally lowered my hands when my head began to throb less. Dr. Harrison was staring at me with fear in his eyes before he ripped the surgical mask off and panted quickly. It looked like he was having a panic attack. 



“No, no, no, no!” He quickly looked behind him into the OR before looking back at me. Without another word, he quickly slammed the door in my face. I was just a little puzzled about that, but I supposed that it was about the same as when your parents are about to visit you and you haven’t cleaned your house yet. So I returned to my reception desk and started again on my last few pieces of paperwork. 



“Hey, Maggie?” Rachel asked as she approached my desk. I looked up at her to see that she had left Wilson standing at the door to the clinic. “Can you cover for us? We’re going to lunch.” She said with a soft smile as she motioned her head over at Wilson. “I’m also going to take him clothes shopping, so we might be gone for a bit.” To think that this was the same girl who, not that long ago, had called me fat and almost every name under the sun. But seeing her happy just made me smile. 



“Of course, Rachel. Have fun with him. And make sure he doesn’t melt.” I half joked. But with Wilson, that was a real concern. She nodded quickly and waved goodbye as she walked over and held Wilson’s hand as she led both of them out of the clinic. I smiled as I watched them leave before finishing my last piece of paperwork and filing it away. Just as I lay back in my chair to enjoy the satisfaction of finishing my work, a loud crash came from OR. 



It soon became abundantly clear that I had been left alone with Dr. Harrison. And not to mention, by the look he gave me when I had mentioned that Mr. Sinclair would be visiting tomorrow, and the reminder of what happened to patients when Dr. Harrison lost control over them. I quickly shot up from my chair, wincing in pain but ignoring it as I ran to the OR. Just as I got to the door, it exploded into splinters as Dr. Harrison went flying past me into the wall across from it. 



“James! Are you okay?!” I shouted as I ran over to him in the rubble of the door and the wall. He coughed uncontrollably before looking at me and quickly grabbed me by the arm and pulled himself up. Before I could even ask him what was happening, he squeezed my arm and yanked me down the hall as he started running. 



“MAGGIE!” An ear-splitting screech echoed out from the room as suddenly a mass of limbs and bones came tumbling out of the room Dr. Harrison had just been thrown from. It quickly unwound itself to reveal Philip’s mangled and transformed body. Dr. Harrison had stripped his body of most of his skin and had attached various arms and legs to his torso. His lower jaw was gone and replaced with a row of teeth that went down the length of his throat. He screeched at us as he began to run after us, using all of his new limbs to close the distance between us, and just as Dr. Harrison pulled me into one of the rooms, the Philip creature whipped his tail toward us, which for a brief moment I saw was made of his spine. 



James quickly shoved a chair against the door and shoved himself against it. “Where’s Wilson?!” He screamed at me, grunting as the Philp monster slammed itself against the door and caused Dr. Harrison to skid his feet across the floor. He quickly slammed himself against the door again and tried his best to keep the creature from breaking in. 



“H-he and Rachel went out for lunch! What the fuck did you do to him?! Out of all the things you could’ve done, you turned him into a centipede?!” It was the best approximation I could put to the monster now threatening to break down the door and do God knows what to both of us. 



“I thought I could control him! But then I lost control after I learned Mr. Sinclair will visit tomorrow!” He grunted as the creature again slammed itself against the door, the frame starting to crack because of the intense weight being thrown against it. “Shit, shit, shit!” Dr. Harrison was clearly panicking, and I couldn’t help but start to as well. “Can you climb through the window there?” He asked me quickly. I looked over at where he had his gaze trained. 



“Maybe if I weren’t chubby!” I shouted at him, seeing that the window was much to small to get through. “What about you? You’re thin enough to go through there!” I told him, quickly running over and adding my weight to the door. 



“I’m not just going to leave you here!” he shouted at me. I looked at him and frowned in anger. 



“Nows not the time to be a dumbass James, get your ass through that window and figure something out!” I yelled at him, letting out a surprised yelp when the creature slammed itself against the door again and more cracks began to form on both the door and the frame. Dr. Harrison looked at me and then over at the window before finally running over to it and opening it. 



“What are you going to do?!” he asked as he opened the window and began to climb out of it. I looked at him and then around the room that we had entered. There were plenty of things here for me to use for defense, of course there wasn’t a very high chance of success. 



“I’ll figure something out, now go!” I screamed at him, he looked at me with worry before fully leaving through the window. At most, it would take him a minute or two to circle back around the clinic and get through. So I had to survive for that long by myself. I quickly left the door and began searching through the cabinets for something to defend myself with. And then my eyes landed on a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. Just as the creature finally broke down the door, I managed to pick up the fire extinguisher from its mount. 



“MAGGIE!” The Philp monster screamed as it finally crashed through the door. I quickly pulled the safety pin out of the extinguisher and quickly blasted the creature with it. A giant cloud of CO2 quickly filled the room and sent both of us into an intense coughing fit. The Philip centipede writhed around and flicked its tail around as the CO2 clung to its mangled body. I held down on the trigger as I quickly exited out into the hallway and held onto the extinguisher as I quickly ran out into the lobby, right into Dr. Harrison, who quickly wrapped me around in his hands and yanked me away and towards the exit. 



We had only just exited out into the parking lot when the Philip centipede crashed through a window of the clinic, still writhing around in pain but now having his eyes trained squarely on the two of us. I looked over at Dr. Harrison and watched as he tried to hypnotize the centipede with his eyes. But to both of our shock, the centipede remained completely unfazed and quickly began to charge at us. I acted quickly and blasted it again with the extinguisher, sending the creature sputtering again. 



“What do we do now?!” I screamed at Dr. Harrison as I held down the trigger of the extinguisher. I stared down at the gauge and saw that we didn’t have much time to be thinking of what to do next. Dr. Harrison looked at me and then quickly grabbed the extinguisher from me. 



“Take the keys out of my pocket! My car is that Chevy Bel Air over there!” He shouted. I quickly picked up what he was thinking and quickly went fishing through his pockets until I found the keys. I sprinted towards the convertible and quickly hopped in. I put the keys in the ignition and spared a glance over at Dr. Harrison. The extinguisher had just run out, and he was now using the empty container like a baseball bat to fend off the centipede creature. 



I turned the car on, and to my annoyance, saw that it was a manual. Trying to remember back to the time my dad had shown me how to drive stick, I managed to put the car into gear and quickly drove towards the centipede. I honked the horn to warn Dr. Harrison that I was on the way, and he quickly jumped out of the way, just as the Philip monster whipped at his face with its spinal tail. 



I slammed the car into the centipede, and for a brief moment, we locked eyes with each other. It screeched at me one last time before I drove us full force into the side of the clinic. The force of the impact set off the airbag, and I came too with a splitting headache. I pushed my face off the steering wheel and looked up to see that the centipede was still alive, but now it was pinned against the wall. 



I opened the door to the car and fell out and onto the floor, suddenly very aware of how much pain I was in. I let out some hard coughs as I looked around for Dr. Harrison. I saw him lying face down in the parking lot, and I quickly crawled over to him. I got to him and managed to roll him over on his back. Unfortunately, it looked like the creature had managed to slash his face. The cut extended across his entire face from his chin across his eyes and into his hair. His fake face was peeling from the cut, and his true, damaged face was exposed just beneath it. He wasn’t going to be happy when he woke up, but for now, it seemed he’d been knocked out by hitting his head on the hard asphalt. 



I looked back over to the car wreck, and felt my heart sink when I saw that the centipede wasn’t there anymore. I looked around quickly in fear, trying to find it. I had taken my eyes off of it for a mere second, and it had somehow managed to unpin itself. I tried shaking Dr. Harrison awake, but he was completely out cold. 



“MAGGIE!” It suddenly screamed as it lunged out towards me from one of the bushes near the clinic. I managed to lock eyes with it and felt that this was the end of the line for me. I closed my eyes and hoped that whatever the Philip creature would do to me would be quick. But a few seconds passed, and nothing happened to me. I slowly opened my eyes and saw that the creature was being slammed against the ground over and over again by Wilson. 



“Maggie! Are you okay?! What happened here?!” Rachel quickly asked as she kneeled down next to me and quickly began to examine me. I looked at her and then over at Wilson as he slammed the centipede on the floor like it was nothing. And he was in nice new clothes that were quickly becoming blood-stained. I couldn’t help but smile and look at Rachel with a smile. 



“Did you two have a nice date?” I asked her before I flopped over onto the parking lot ground. All of the adrenaline had finally left my body, and I passed out from the pain of the car crash I had just been through. 



When I next came to, I was in one of the recovery rooms. I had a mild concussion, but Rachel had assured me that nothing else was wrong with me. She had had to fix up my stitches as during the ordeal, they had snapped and come undone, but all in all, I had gotten off lightly. Dr. Harrison was still unconscious, so we were all waiting around to see when he’d awaken. Wilson had taken care of the centipede. Rachel wouldn’t exactly tell me how he’d done it, but I had seen Wilson rub his stomach with a satisfied look on his face, so I could at least infer what he’d done. 



Rachel had brought me a snack, so I was sitting in my reception area eating the muffin she had brought me. It was good, but the entire ordeal had taken my appetite from me. I didn’t want to waste the muffin, however, so when I heard the familiar rummaging coming from the lost and found box, I quietly rolled over to it. The bread creature was looking through everything again, and it quickly took notice of me, all of its eyeballs looking up at me. 



“You want this?” I held out the muffin to it. I didn’t know if it would be considered cannibalism for a burnt piece of toast to eat a muffin, but after everything I’d gone through, I wouldn’t have been surprised in the least. I set the muffin down into the box, and as soon as I did, the bread creature grabbed it and quickly sprinted out of the box. “You’re welcome.” I scoffed as it skedaddled away. 



As I was sitting in the reception area and Wilson and Rachel were busy being lovebugs together, I heard something crawling over to me. As I swivvled in my chair to see what it was, a hand reached out and grabbed my hand. 



“Maggie…” It was Dr. Harrison. He was panting uncontrollably, and his face was still heavily damaged from the fight. He squeezed my hand and also placed his other hand on my thigh, giving it an even harder squeeze. “You…you did this to me.” He hissed gently, his voice hoarse and coarse like gravel. I stared at him for a moment, thinking that he had forgotten what had just happened in the parking lot. 



But that wasn’t what he meant. As I stared into his green eyes, which were bloodshot and in obvious agony, it finally hit me. Why had he suddenly started stalking me again after our interaction? Because I had touched his face. It had seemed like nothing to me, but to him, it had been an invitation to try and earn my love and affection. He wasn’t blaming me for his face, he was blaming me for his actions. For his obsession with me. 



As I stared down at him, I couldn’t help but find him so pathetic. I was immune to his hypnosis, and this fascinated him to no end. And it had grown into an obsession. I sighed deeply and reached both my hands out and held his face in my hands. His pupils shrank into pinpricks when I touched him before they suddenly expanded to the size of dinner plates. He looked up at me like he was in pure ecstasy. 



“Oh…Maggie.” A happy smile spread across his face as he touched his hands against mine and looked at me with pure joy. I gave him what he wanted, and hopefully, going forward, I can keep him more stable. And if that means turning into his babysitter and making him believe that I have any sort of feelings for him? 



So be it.
