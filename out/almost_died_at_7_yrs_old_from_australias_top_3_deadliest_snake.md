I live in Darwin, Australia and when I was 7 years old I was bitten by a 6 foot king brown (mulga) snake on my foot. If you asked any doctor alive today if a child can survive that bite, all of them would say no. Which is why I want to make this post for people that are scared of snakes or live out rural & see them frequently. I don’t want you to freak out and think you’re going to die as soon as a venomous snake bites you because you will end up dying just from your panicking alone. Always have a first aid kit with heaps of bandages. If you live in an area where there are a lot of snakes and you don’t own a first aid kit, you are basically asking to die. I wouldn’t be alive if my dad didn’t start wrapping my leg up immediately starting from the top & going down to the bite mark. Buy a cat because they will keep the kind of creatures that lure snakes out of your house. The main key to staying alive is keeping your heart rate down and trying not to panic because the pain will get really bad. The more you panic, the faster the venom travels to your heart. The thing that kept me calm and not scream from the constant pain was my father. Every time I screamed I seen how it broke him, so I had to be strong for him not just myself. It felt like a shipping container was on my leg. Try your hardest to stay awake. Sleep feels really good when you’re in the ICU room. Make sure someone is slapping you in the face every time you doze off. If you can find the snake or know what kind of snake bit you, that increases your chance of survival by a lot because they can give you the right antivenom. It’s either that or they will pump your body with horse blood.

I had no appetite for hospital food when in there. Even though I did eat a chicken drumstick from the servo once a week I did not do the #2 for what I remember was the entire time I was in there for 3-4 months. My urine turned a Coca Cola black almost purple colour. The colour of the snake was a creamy white colour. The way how I got bit was I was riding my bike and there was an upside-down boat that I pretended to fill my bike up like a fuel station and the snake was inside there guarding its eggs and next thing I know all I see is its head on my foot and the black eyes were the scariest part. It made it look so evil. I ran and blood was splattered all up my leg but luckily my dad was home, and he saved my life. And lucky the snake wasn’t moving out in the bush otherwise we would have never found it and I would’ve got pumped with horse blood as a last attempt to keep me alive. The only snake doctor in Darwin was just at the airport ready to fly out when he got the call to come and save me. They called me miracle boy and all the doctors from every ward came to shake my hand and was going to put me on the front page of the news, but my dad didn’t want all the reporters in my face after I had almost died.

If a little kid survived a bite from one of the deadliest snakes in the world which has the largest-recorded venom output of any snake in the world, then you definitely can. I want this post to give you hope the next time a doctor tells you that you have a life-threatening illness/disease. I know someone else who had a new type of cancer that was never seen before and survived, despite the doctors telling him that he had a 99% chance of dying. on black and white paper, it might look like you're dying but no matter how many machines they plug into your body, they can't test your spirit and your will to live.
