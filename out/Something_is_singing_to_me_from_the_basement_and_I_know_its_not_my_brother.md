I've always had what my father called, "an overactive imagination."

That usually applied to him gaslighting me whenever I saw him cheating on my stepmom.

Prick.

But sometimes he was right. I used to suffer from night terrors as a kid, thought that something in the basement was trying to get me. Sometimes it would be in the basement or climbing up the stairs, maybe even in the closet or under the bed. Hiding behind the door. Just waiting for that fateful moment where I'd slip into a dreamless sleep, so it could pounce on me, grip my unconscious body, open its enormous jaws to reveal sharp, jagged rows of teeth, and...

I'd always called for my big brother, Jensen. Every time. I was just a little snot-nosed kid, barely seven, and I'd bawl my eyes out after I woke up from those nightmares. Sometimes sleep paralysis accompanied them, and those were the times where I'd make Jensen sleep in my bed with me. It was comical, really, having a six-foot something, nineteen-year old military veteran folding himself up as best as he could to fit in my little kid-sized bed with me. But he always did it, no complaints. That's the kind of brother he was. He would always tell me that it was okay, that the basement was off limits anyway, and nothing could get me while he was here.

He used to sing to me. That was his thing. He did it for my younger brother, too, but Vince was a special case. Vince is deaf (and doing just fine, thanks for asking) and he just used to sit with his dead right ear on Jensen's chest, feeling the vibrations of his voice filling his body as he lulled him to sleep every night. Vince is four years younger than me, so he needed the lullaby more than I did when we were little.

The tune was always... weird. I'd looked up the song multiple times since, but could never find it anywhere. He would never tell me what it was when I asked growing up, or sometimes he would give me a different, misleading name. Recently, when I asked Jensen what he used to sing to me, he dismissed me with a wave of his hand, claiming that he didn't remember. When I pried, he got pissed off, telling me that he really didn't remember, that it was too long ago. I mean, it tracked. We were a great deal older than we used to be. But that always used to spark an uneasy feeling in the back of my mind, one that just got worse as time began to go by.

The feeling really started when I started catching him downstairs during the night, padlocking the basement door. 

He'd wrap a heavy chain around it, pulling it tight, before sinking down in one of the dining chairs across the room and pulling out a pack of cigarettes. He'd always been a heavy smoker, but I'd never once heard him cough, or receive any news from doctors signaling his eventual demise via lung cancer. He'd just puff on the cigarette, eyeing the basement door like it was going to break open at any second, his left leg bouncing with adrenaline. But everything would remain silent, and he would just sit there.

I'd find him down there, smoking cigarettes to their butts until the witching hour. This would happen a few times a week, and sometimes I'd sit with him in silence, sipping from a mug of coffee after tending to my newborn baby upstairs, to try to convince myself that I need more sleep. Without fail, every time I sat with him, he would knock his knuckles on the dining room table three times at around two in the morning, before puffing out a large exhale of smoke, snubbing out the cigarette in his porcelain ashtray, and disappearing back upstairs.

Then it started to escalate. Last Wednesday, I saw him sitting down at the table, as usual. It was already past two in the morning, but this time, my wife, Nadiya, was with him. She was paler than usual, her eyes wide, like Jensen had said something unbelievable to her. When she saw me coming, she had flung herself out of her chair, barreling into me with a force I haven't quite felt before. She was clinging onto me so much tighter than she ever had, and she made me take her back upstairs without talking to my brother first. Before she let me go back to bed, she insisted I set up the soft crib for Rosalina, our daughter, to sleep in next to our bed.

"Please, Ali. Just for tonight. I'll lock the door, I just need her in here with me tonight," Nadiya pleaded,  pulling at my arm like a woman possessed. I'd never seen her like this: she looked like she hadn't been sleeping at all, dark circles under her eyes, hair mussed, gaunt frame. So I agreed, fetching the soft crib from our closet as she scooped up our baby from her room, slamming and locking our bedroom door behind her in a frenzy. She didn't tell me why she wanted Rosie with us, or why she was so panicked, she was just adamant that I did *not* go downstairs until Jensen left.

Nadiya was able to sleep fine that night. Rosie was fussy until I got her back into the reliable throes of REM, but I just... couldn't. I couldn't sleep. I kept tossing and turning, and I know it sounds crazy, but I *swear* I heard three knocks on our bedroom door all night long. Identical to the ones Jensen always performed on our dining room table like a stupid ritual.

The next morning, Nadiya had gone to work, placing Rosie back into her crib in her room across the hall before she left. It's like she felt nothing back could happen in the daylight, because she kissed me on the forehead before she walked out, like she always did when everything was okay. But I knew it wasn't. Something was wrong, and I could feel it. It was a little needling feeling in the back of my mind, and I could feel anxiety gnawing at the base of my neck, creeping into my temples and making me restless.

Normally I went to work with Diya at the same time every morning, leaving Rosie with my sister for the day, but that morning, I'd called in sick. I told Diya that I felt like I was coming down with a stomach bug, and that I'd lie in bed all day. She made me promise that I wouldn't speak a word to Jensen until she came home that night, and she left, looking as beautiful as ever. She looked normal. Her skin was flush with color, her dark, wavy hair vibrant in the sunlight, and she had smiled at me before closing our bedroom door behind her.

I still don't know what possessed me to call in sick. It's like it wasn't even me picking up the phone. It's like deep down, I knew it was a bullshit risk. But I had to do it.

Because I had to know what was in the basement. To finally put my overactive imagination to rest. To tell myself that there was really nothing down there, and that both me and my family could live safe in the house above it. Even if Jensen was locking the door and watching every night. 

So about ten minutes after Diya left for work, I cracked open my bedroom door. There was nothing outside of it, and I couldn't hear any sound that would indicate Rosie being awake in her room. So I tiptoed downstairs, down to the first floor. The tall staircase opened to the first floor next to the open dining room, and I could see where Jensen usually sat in plain view as I hesitated on the third step from the bottom. The lights of the first floor were off, the rooms around me dark, but there was some light that caught my attention more than anything else, my head snapping upward and my body freezing as I realized.

The basement door was open.

Well, cracked open, really. But I saw the light on in the basement itself, a single ray of bright fluorescent lighting up the staircase leading into its waiting maw, and I felt my stomach drop into my balls as I heard a familiar tune. 

No... oh no, no, no....

I heard sick crunching noises, a weak gasp, and a long exhale, all while the bittersweet tune wafted up from the bottom of the basement. It sounded like Jensen, but something was... wrong. It didn't sound exactly like him, and he was missing a few notes each time. it was like he was tone deaf. He usually always took great care to become pitch-perfect, for Vince to feel the vibrations when he couldn't sleep, and the tune would be predictable each time. But this was... something else...

I grabbed Vince's lucky baseball bat he left next to the dining room table, my hands shaking as I wielded it in front of my face. I was pretty sure I could take him if things went south. He was a forty year old chain-smoker for Christ's sake, there was no way I couldn't...

As I creaked open the basement door as slowly and quietly as I could, poking my head down into the stairwell, I could hear a peculiar, wet sawing noise. Jensen's voice was mildly labored now, and he was humming, not singing, but it was plain as day. Even though I was closer now, only at the top of the staircase, it sounded like he was getting farther away.

Some damn curiosity drew me further down the stairwell, taking each step as a descent into Hell itself. I could feel my blood pounding in my ears, my entire body trembling with adrenaline, like I was waiting for something to jump out at me, or run toward me, stomping up the stairs to reach me and kill me...

Oh, shit, shit, shit. This was crazy. This was the stupidest idea I'd ever had the audacity to think of, let alone act upon, and now I was holding a baseball bat, prepared to beat the shit out of my older brother who's never raised a hand to anyone, all because the basement door was fucking open for once. God dammit, Alistair, pull yourself together--

I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard Jensen humming right behind me, right into my left ear.

I lost my footing on the step, almost falling down the stairs, but I managed to grab the flimsy railing framing the wall on my right. I hurled myself down the stairs, much less concerned about whatever was waiting for me at the bottom at this point, and was met with no sign of my brother, let alone anything else.

The basement was empty.

I felt like such an idiot, especially when I heard the basement door slam at the top of the stairs. 

It's like a malicious energy was invading the basement, the single fluorescent bulb flickering with anticipation as the corners of the room seemed to darken, and... something... wearing my brother's skin materialized in the center of the room, under the prying light. 

It was impossibly tall, sharp incisors dripping with poisonous venom as it viewed my cowering frame, eight beady eyes like a spider boring into my very soul. 

I could vaguely make out the blond and black hair of my older brother, and I realized that his torso, head, and arms were jutting out of the spine of this... amalgamation of human flesh and evil. He looked like he was asleep, his eyes closed, and he looked like he was in pain. 

When the fucking thing spoke to me, it sounded like it was trying to borrow his voice, but failing. It spoke in whispers, Jensen's voice snaking through two others, but I wasn't too scared anymore. It was like my brain was beginning to block out whatever I was seeing, because my fragile human brain couldn't comprehend it.

It said one thing to me, before lowering itself down closer to the floor, as if it was preparing to pounce on me. Something about that stance made my heart feel like it was dropping into my balls, and I pressed myself against the brick wall behind me.

"He told you the basement was off limits, Alistair." 

The demon continued its sluggish advance toward me, muscles tension and jaws snapping as it prepared to devour me. More and more limbs began to snap and jolt away from its back, like it was becoming more spiderlike by the second. 

Its dark, soulless eyes were trained on me like they were glued on, but right as it prepared to lurch forward, I heard a gasp behind the thing as Jensen suddenly woke up, coughing and sputtering as he forced himself out of the tight crevice his body was wedged into. 

The demon shrieked at the loss of its possession, wailing in pain as Jensen flung himself on the floor. He was still wearing what he had on the night before, and I suddenly understood that it wasn't him speaking to Nadiya last night. 

Jen gasped as he hit the concrete floor hard from his suspension six feet in the air, but he scrambled to his feet to grab my right arm and hurl me back towards the staircase. I didn't look, I didn't even think as I ran up the stairs, three at a time, hearing the demon curse at us, spitting and crying as Jensen and I booked it back up to the surface. As we burst through the doorway, slamming the door behind us and locking it with the chain and padlock, Jensen gripped his chest as we both panted. 

We could still hear the thing downstairs yelling, but eventually its sobs melted into the peculiar tune Jensen used to sing to us. It was almost like it was trying to lure us back downstairs, adopting voices that we knew, and ones we didn't. Begging us to come back down, to help it up, it was hurt...

But Jensen and I knew. Whatever that thing was, it proved me right. My imagination wasn't hyperactive. I just always suspected that something down in the basement wanted me, wanted to hurt my family.

Even as I type this from my laptop in the dining room, I can hear Jensen's voice humming pathetically. The real Jensen is sitting across from me, drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette. I don't know what to tell Nadiya to make her understand that Jensen is back to normal. I don't think I can make her understand. She wouldn't believe me anyway.

All we know... is that something is singing to us from the basement. And it's not Jensen.
