I’m a 34 year old male. I work as a government scientist, but not just any I'm one that works on stuff they get from space. I shouldn’t be saying this, but I don't have much time left. There are things out there, and we know about them. I work in the section with the parasites. One of the highest levels. We had about 9 that night. 



On June 2nd 2018 There was an escape. All 9 of the parasites were able to escape out of their containers; 17 personnel were lost that night, 13 were scientists and 4 were military officers. I blacked out during this, and awoke in a hospital with my boss over me. She said, “ We had 17 people die last night. We found you with head trauma, and took you to this hospital.” “We found 8 parasites.” “8!” I said. “Yes.” she said “We don’t know what happened to the last one, but until we find it all of you are on paid leave.” She walked out after that, and I was discharged with just some minor trauma. 



It all started on June 5th 2018. I had a seizure, and got sent to the hospital. The doctor said I was okay and since you’ve never had a history of seizures before it was probably just stress.

I went home and got in my bed with some noodles to watch some tv. Then I rushed to the bathroom, and started puking my guts up. Long story short I had 4 seizures that day. 



The doctors didn’t know what was wrong, they did all the scans and it kept coming back negative. That's when I first heard it. It was just a thought, but it felt like it was placed there not like I thought it up. I know it sounds weird, and it is. I was sent home that night, and actually got some sleep, but I had some horrifying dreams. Dreams of some black liquid entering me it looked like the parasites. It had to be just dreams. I awoke in a sweat with a scream coming out of me at exactly 3:37 AM. 



I didn’t get called back in for weeks. Those weird thoughts continued. I just kept getting thinner and thinner. I was a good 205 Lbs before this and now I'm 145 Lbs.



On July 4th 2018 it talked for what I think is the first time. It said in my head you really just think that that parasite just disappeared. Why do you think you blacked out? You’re never gonna be called back and know, you’ll be dead before they ever do. You’ll die on December 19th 2018 at 3:37 AM. 



After that I blacked out again, and I felt like it was just a dream, but I was never called back into work. Every Night at the same time it talked to me and it ended with me blacking out.



Soon December 18th came and I was terrified to go to sleep. I tried to stay up. I really did, but nonetheless I fell asleep, and tonight I awoke at 2:00 AM. I decided I needed to get my story out, but right now it's 3:34 AM. And I’m scared. Please help.

I’m a government scientist, there's something inside of me
