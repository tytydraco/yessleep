I understand the title of this story sounds sketchy. A bit over-the-board, like an 80’s slasher movie. If I were in your place, dear reader, I definitely wouldn’t have high expectations coming in.  

It’s okay. Matter of fact, you are probably thinking this is just another silly, internet creepypastas, written under a thin veil of amateurism and engorged with a large dose of urban legends, stereotypical horror clichés and bad spelling.  

You would be right about the bad spelling, though the word document I’m writing this on seems to be pretty good with correcting my many mistakes. I apologize in advance for them - I never paid much attention in school.  

Oh, and by the way, the title - the silly, over-the-top title - it’s absolutely true.   

Do you know how long it took me to write that 16-word title?  

*Years.*  

Yes. Trauma will do that to you. And I’m not your run-of-the-mill, scared-of-their-own-shadow type of fool either.  

Do you know the feeling of taking a life? Pulling the trigger and seeing a person on the other side collapse as if the strings keeping them up were suddenly cut?  

I do. I’m not proud of it, though when I was young and reckless I was. Nowadays, if I think about it a little bit longer, it makes me wanna cry.  

It’s okay. It helps me heal.  

Because when I think about what I saw in that Godless place, I can’t sleep with the lights off.  

\-  

“How come your uncle isn’t coming, B?”  

It’s difficult to hear Richard over the jet engine. Its rusty inside is trying to start up with a concerning series of noises. They are so choppy that they remind me of the gunshots from my neighborhood.  

“He’s sick. He was throwing up all over his room.”  

Richard laughs hysterically. His laugh is so typical of him, so bizarrely loud, that it can easily trample the cacophony of chaos coming from the jet engine.  

“I told him, I told him to not go up with those Peruvian hookers. For fuck’ sakes B, one of them was cross-eyed! Who knows what kind of diseases they carry!”  

“I don’t think cross-eye is a sexually transmissible disease, Richard.”   

“These indians are all like cousins or first cousins or something, and then they all fuck each other and make those weird babies with strange diseases. It kills the white man that dares fucking them. Like a defense mechanism.”  

I stare at Richard for a second. He’s a ginger, as pale as they come - I think he’s Irish, though we don’t talk about that. Me and my uncle, on the other hand, are as black as you can possibly be. We’re American, though I think we have a grandmother in Haiti or something.  

“Oh shit!” Richard realizes I’m staring at him and slaps me on the shoulder. “You know what I mean - black, white, yellow, western men get screwed when they come around here and eat the local produce.”  

“We’re ready to go, gentleman!” The pilot comes around the small airplane and tells us with very poor English. I also happen to notice he looks pretty much like the rest of the locals, and as I’m working with Richard into loading the plane with cocaine, I’m hoping that the pilot didn’t hear his comments.  

Once we have loaded the thing with enough product to land us all a couple of life sentences, we board the tiny plane. It’s old, rusty and metallic. I’m trying not to think too much about it, but by the time I sit down and buckle my seat belt, I’m sweating bullets. Fear is a funny thing. I have never had problems when it came to guns…   

But this fucking airplane is almost making me quit.  

“You can’t quit now,” Richard teases me as if he read my mind, sitting on my right, a daredevil smile on his face.  

He’s wrong. Theoretically I could. I mean, we’re in the Amazon rain forest, in the middle of fucking nowhere, a place that is vaguely in-between Brazil, Peru and Bolivia.  

But I could just leave and hop on the jeep we parked close and return to the narco-village my uncle is currently staying in.  

It would only be a two-hour drive…  

Except that then, there would be no one from the family on the plane.   

“How many times have you flown on this thing?” I ask, wiping sweat off my upper lip.  

“*This* one? I don’t know. Alejandro! Have we used this one before?” He yells through the tiny door in front of us, into the cabin, where the pilot is doing whatever it is pilots do before the takeoff.   

“No, *patrón*. This new!” Alejandro’s tiny face appears on the doorway with the insincere smile of an overpaid employee.  

“Great,” I say, longingly looking through the tiny window at the safe ground outside.   

“Are you afraid? That ain’t *gangsta*, Mr. B. I thought you guys were hard.”  

Richard is a forty-something-years old smuggler. Through his connections and my father and uncle’s distribution, the three men have built an empire. They are all similarly aged and share a mutual respect.   

He doesn’t respect me. I’m twenty one.  

But as I said, I’m afraid of crappy airplanes - not bullets.  

“If this shit falls, I’m putting a bullet in your head before we hit the ground, Richard.”  

He laughs at me.  

“Now that’s more like it!”  

“Permission to takeoff, Mr. Richard?” Alejandro’s tiny head appears in the doorway again.  

“Permission granted, big man. Let’s go to Mexico!”  

\-  

You don’t get pure, white-powder cocaine into the United States by airplane. You do it by land, via Mexico.  

You don’t get pure (much less cheap) cocaine out of Mexico by negotiating with the cartels. They’ll overcharge you, sell you crap, and make you beg for it because you are black.  

No, no, you go straight to the source - Bolivia, Colombia, Peru. You buy it there. You smuggle it into Mexico itself, where it’s manageable enough to do so. Then you sneak it past the US land border with a bunch of mules - a surprisingly easy task - and if you got a distribution network like we do, boom, you build an empire.  

“There! Can you see it? That rough patch right over there.”  

Richard has removed his seat belt and is standing over me, pointing at something. I peer through the tiny, dirty window. In the absolute ocean of green that surrounds us on all sides, I think I can spot what looks like a couple of burnt buildings and a clean patch of land.  

“I think so… What is it?”  

“One of Pablo’s biggest plantations and factories. They burnt it down years ago.”  

“Oh, shit. You ever met him?”  

Richard smiles, a dreamy look on his eyes. “Once. I think I was around your age at the time. My boss was buying some of his product. Turns out there was a mistake - Pablo thought we were buying over a hundred times what we were really after. My boss was Peruvian, the street slang for kilos and tons didn’t match. Luckily for us, the guys who introduced us were good friends with Pablo, so no harm no foul.”  

“Didn’t he think it weird that a ginger was running with a bunch of Peruvian traffickers?”  

Richard laughs - it sounds like a bark. “Hell yeah. That’s the first thing he said. ‘Who’s the *rojito*?!’”  

Richard’s impression of Pablo manages to make me laugh and I momentarily forget how close I am to death in that shitty airplane.  

“You know, the thing that screwed Pablo was all that innocent killing,” Richard continues. “He lost all his support doing that. Everyone in the game thought he was God, and then the explosions started happening and—”   

**BOOM**  

*Screaming.*  

*Black.*  

*Light.*  

*Darkness.*  

I’m stuck in a bad dream. There’s a fireball - a raging, world-eating fireball that’s going to kill us all. Richard is screaming like a bitch the whole time. He’s messing up my sleep, and I feel so, so tired—  

I jolt awake. The first thing I notice is a strange feeling in my mouth. It feels wet and coppery… Like blood.  

I wanna wipe it off but my left arm isn’t working. I’m curious as to why, and when I look down I find the reason.  

My left arm is crushed in between my seat’s armrest and the wall.  

Hmm. That shouldn’t be possible.  

Except that my seat is several feet behind where it should be. Richard is not to my right anymore, he’s in front of me, diagonally to the side. There’s a gaping hole right in front of me, where my seat used to be.  

“OH MY GOD, WE’RE GOING TO DIE, JESUS CHRIST! PLEASE LORD, PLEASE—”  

Richard wasn’t just screaming in my dreams, apparently. He’s screaming in real life.   

Oh, and it’s not just a hole beneath where my seat used to be. The tiny, dirty window is gone. I can see part of the engine outside, and it’s a flaming, orange fireball.  

I think we’re falling. It’s funny, I’m not scared anymore.  

Everything feels so slow.  

I use my right hand to get the blood off my mouth. Except it’s not just in my mouth - it’s all over my face. I think I hit my head somewhere pretty hard.  

Alejandro’s head keeps popping up again. His fake smile is gone - I see his true eyes now. People show their true selves when they are afraid. I think we’re all going to die, because he’s screaming something in Spanish that I can’t make out.  

“*Agárrense! Agárrense fuerte!* GRAB! GRAB STRONG!”  

I have no idea what he’s saying. Everything feels dreamy to me, like this isn’t really happening. Through the gap where the window was I can see the green of the forest.  

And it’s coming up to meet us.  

*I’m going to die. I’m going to die in this forsaken forest.*  

The last thing I think before we hit the trees is that my mother will never know.  

I wish I could send her a message, someho—  

**THUD**  

I jump, with my seat, several feet in the air and land back. I think I hit my head again, but I’m not quite sure.  

We’re not dead. I can hear the breaks outside fuming. We’ve landed somewhere without trees, apparently, because we haven’t exploded into nothing yet.  

And then there’s another *thud*, and my world gets back to darkness.  

\-  

My mother loved me so much as a child. She was a little old when she had me, almost thirty six. Doctors weren’t sure I was going to be born healthy or not. It was a high-risk pregnancy. After delivering me, she was in the hospital for several weeks. She almost didn’t make it.  

“But I didn’t care. As long as you were healthy, I didn’t care. B, I love you so much, do you know that? Don’t die in that jungle, B. Please, come back to me…”  

\-  

I killed an innocent woman once. It was my third hit. I was only seventeen years old. Age doesn't mean a lot where I’m from. The youngest start at twelve, thirteen, and some of them are killers.  

I walked up to my target across 32nd Street. They called him P-Money. He’s from another neighborhood. It’s a bit complicated, and I’m not here to glorify any of that stupid shit, so suffice to say that P-Money was in the game, and he belonged to a set that was affiliated to a rival faction from ours. I was young, dumb, and desperate to prove myself before my father and uncle’s eyes. P-Money had been acting disrespectfully towards us, and he was making matters worse by hanging out where he wasn’t supposed to, right in front of everybody.  

He needed a lesson. An ass whooping would have done it.  

But I wanted to be a tough guy.  

I think I got him in the first shot. I was good with the glock - hit him right in the belly.   

He looked at me like they all do. Eyes wide open in terror, like a deer caught in headlights.  

Then he ran. Both hands clutching his bleeding gut, he stumbled away. There was nothing he could do - I was too close.  

An abandoned car was nearby. His only possible refuge. Like a rat, P-Money crawled behind it on instinct. It was pitiful, and at that moment I did feel sorry for him. I wondered what it must be like, to feel the panic that he was feeling.  

If only I knew then I was about to experience something much worse.  

I didn't want to chase P-Money around the car. The broken thing was rusty, and I could even see my victim’s leg poking out behind it.  

Good-bye, P, I remember thinking, feeling like a gangster in a movie.  

An absolute idiot.  

So I aimed and I shot.  

Once. Twice… Then, the entire clip.  

The metal sang as my bullets pierced it. Pierced it, hitting P-Money a couple more times. He died right there.  

So did the woman across the street, hit by one of the ricocheting bullets right in her heart.  

I only realized it when her six year old daughter started screaming.  

\-  

My arm hurts. A *lot*. It’s the main thing that assures me that I exist, because everything else is just darkness.  

There’s a lot of words being spoken that I can’t understand. My Spanish is shit, but this sounds like something else entirely.  

“*Segura, segura, forte*… Hold, hold him!”  

Hands grab me, the pain gets worse and I’m screaming…  

Screaming…  

\-  

What brings me out of the darkness is a very simple, basic, human desire.  

I’m thirsty. My throat feels raw, as if the skin inside of it had been coated in sand.  

It’s so bad that it forces me to open my eyes. My vision is blurry, as if I’m underwater.   

I can’t see anything at first. But as my pupils do their job and begin adjusting, I realize it’s not just my eyes - I’m in a very dark place.  

It’s around that moment that I notice another pair of eyes. Tiny, black, alive. Right in front of me, staring me down. I wonder how long they have been there, waiting for me to wake up.  

“Stuart! Get out of there!” A voice rings down from the darkness. The rat sitting upon my chest scurries away, his long, hairless tail trailing behind him.  

It disgusts me enough that I try to move, but fail. I moan in pain as everything feels difficult.  

“Hey, hey, hey!” I hear the voice saying as it approaches me. Out of the darkness to my right, a man materializes. “It’s okay, it’s okay. Relaaax, brother. Don’t hurt yourself.”  

A tall, gaunt-looking figure appears in front of my eyes. As I’m laying down and he stands above me, I feel like he’s the tallest person I’ve ever seen.  

And the rat is on his shoulder.  

“I see you’ve already met Stuart,” he continues, smiling as his pinky finger caresses the rat’s head. “He’s a bit of a social butterfly. I apologize if he frightened you.”  

“I…” I managed to croak. My voice is so broken that I can hardly recognize it. “Where… What…” Halfway through my sentence, I give up on trying to find any explanations. “Water. Please…”  

“Oh right! You must be thirsty!” The gaunt man slaps himself in the forehead and scurries away into the darkness. Thankfully, he comes back a few seconds later, holding what looks to be a plastic bottle cut in half.  

I eagerly reach for it with my weakened right arm, but he pushes my hand away. “No, no, don’t make an effort now. You need rest!”  

He gently brings the makeshift cup to my lips. He pours it very carefully, and I manage to drink it without choking. That water is the most delicious thing I’ve ever tasted, even though it feels warm.  

“How’s your arm?” He asks me, his eyes falling upon my left arm. It’s only then that I realize that it is bandaged, and it seems to be tied to my body and neck, immobilized by what looks to be a makeshift arm sling. It hurts, but for now the pain still feels far away.  

“It’s… I think… Okay?”  

“It will be fine. I’ve worked with worse,” he says, his fingers reaching for the bandages. He’s gentle and seems to know what he’s doing, so I let him.  

“Did you… Do this?”   

“Yes,” he smiles at me. “We’re running out of material, though I managed to save you the last of it. I think it’s pretty decently immobilized.”  

“Who are you? Where am I—aarggh!”  

Something furry scurries away at my feet.  

“Stuart! Behave yourself or I’ll put you back in the cage!” The gaunt man yells. “I’m sorry Bokor. He’s just excited to meet new people.”  

“You know my name?”  

“Your friend told us,” he smiles at me. I realize now that he’s missing most of his teeth. “I’m Eduardo, by the way,” he says, reaching for my right hand and doing a pretend shake. “As far as where you are, it’s—”  

“Eduardo!” A grave voice rings out from the darkness. It yells something else as well, but I can’t understand the language. Eduardo’s eyes widen in terror.  

“Oh, *caralho!*” He says, moving away into the darkness. I don’t want to miss where he’s going, so I rise up a bit in the bed, despite the pain in my arm. I can see Eduardo going to the back of the room and looking out of what seems to be a window.   

He looks afraid when he hurries back to me.  

“The clouds made me lose track of time, Bokor. I’m sorry. I didn’t think you would be awake either.”  

“What? What’s going on?”  

“I’m going to need you to trust me, okay?”  

“Why? What did that man want?”  

“There’s no time for that… They’re coming. Listen to me, listen to me! Close your eyes and pretend to be asleep. No matter what happens, do not open them, do not make a sound. Do you understand?”  

The expression on his face and the tone of his voice tell me this man is serious. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen another person terrified - truly terrified - but it’s infectious. I can feel my fear growing in the pit of my stomach.  

So I just nod. Eduardo’s wide eyes are looking at me, and he nods back before scuttling away into the darkness. Now that my eyes have adjusted, I can see that we’re in a tiny, two-beds room. Eduardo gets on the other bed, covers himself and is immediately still.  

I close my eyes. My heart is beating inside my chest so strongly that I fear it can be heard from a mile away.  

A million thoughts are running through my head.  

Where am I?  

What is going on?  

I even consider the possibility that I somehow died on that plane and I’m in hell.  

Silence reigns all around me. It’s thick, like a blanket. It somehow feels as if every living creature is holding their breath…  

And then I hear it.  

Screams.  

Somewhere nearby, a man is screaming. I desperately want to open my eyes but I heed to Eduardo’s advice. I’m too scared to do anything else.  

The screaming pierces through my soul. I’m so scared that it feels real, like the very sound of it is cutting my flesh.  

*Please, God, please, make it end, help that man, whoever he is*—  

It doesn’t end. Not right away. I can’t tell you for how long it went on. It must have been minutes, though it felt horribly longer.  

The worst part is that it didn’t end abruptly.  

Nor did it stop slowly, as if the victim lost his strength and couldn’t shout anymore, no matter what atrocities were being committed.  

*No.*  

The screaming got further and further away.  

The victim was dragged somewhere. He screamed the whole way, but at some point it was just lost in the distance.  

*Is it over?*  

The silence that remains is sepulchral. I don’t dare move nor open my eyes. Whatever is going on in this hellish place, I will wait until Eduardo comes for me.  

My heart is beating so strongly that I’m afraid I’ll give myself a heart attack. I try to calm myself down as much as I can situation.  

I focus on my breathing. Slowly, in and out, I try to regain control of it. The sound of it is the only thing I can hold on to without losing my mind.  

It’s been a while now since the screams have gone away. The terror is settling down in the pit of my stomach.  

Even Stuart seems to have felt it, too. From somewhere in the dark, I can hear his tiny feet scuttling away. I hope that rat isn’t coming for me, because if anything touches me, I don’t know if I can stop myself from screaming.  

The scuttling gets louder. At first, I think the rat must be getting closer, but then I start considering another possibility.  

It’s not scuttling I hear.  
It’s…  

*Whispers.* But I can’t make them out.  

Could it be Eduardo?  

Do I dare move?  

I keep my eyes closed. I’m too scared to do anything.  

There’s a rhythm to the sound. I can’t understand the words, but they seem to repeat in a pattern. It sounds like some form of Spanish, though I can’t make it out.  

Then, it stops.  

“Bokor, it’s okay, they’re gone,” Eduardo’s voice rings out next to me.  

With a breath of relief, I open my eyes.  

\-  

I’m going to briefly pause here for a second. There’s a few reasons for that.  

The first one is that, when I wrote this down, I actually had to physically take a break. That memory is… Difficult. It took me a long time to be able to talk about it, much less…  

Describe it.  

The second reason is precisely that—description. It’s a very challenging task to describe what I saw when I opened my eyes that night.  

I’ll start by jumping ahead a little bit and tell you what happened next, in case you are wondering.  

I screamed. When my eyes opened, I screamed so much I damaged my vocal cords and my voice was barely more than a whisper for the next couple days.  

I also, thankfully, lost consciousness. I didn’t recover it until way into the half of the following day, where this story continues.  

Now… Now that I’ve postponed it as much as possible… And have had a strong drink, I’ll do you justice, reader, and attempt to describe what I saw when I opened my eyes.  

\-  

“Bokor, it’s okay, they’re gone,” Eduardo’s voice rings out next to me.  

With a breath of relief, I open my eyes.  

It takes a couple of seconds for my vision to focus in the dark. Eduardo’s gaunt body is standing by my bed, just as before.  

“What happ—” I began asking, but didn’t finish.  

It was Eduardo’s tall body by my side. I’m certain of it.  

But it wasn’t Eduardo.  

Because the thing standing by my side didn’t wear his face.  

It wore my mother’s.  

It was grinning at me. Except where I would expect loving eyes to be, were two black, maggot-infested holes. And an inhuman grin that dripped with rotten blood.  

There were other things wrong with it, but I didn’t have time to process because it came down upon me, grinning all the way.  

And then it *screamed*. The broken jaw gaped impossibly wide and there were things I cannot describe lurking inside the dead pit of its throat.  

But by then I was screaming, too, and God gave me a gift by making me lose my consciousness…  

\-  

And that was my first night at the place I later learned to be called the Kalla. Unfortunately, it wasn’t my last, and the events that unfolded inside those forsaken walls are forever etched into my psyche. If you guys are interested, I'll share some more stories. Now, I'm afraid I need more alcohol - I can tell it's going to be a rough night.
