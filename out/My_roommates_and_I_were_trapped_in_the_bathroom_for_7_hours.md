I just woke up in the middle of the night with my face covered in sweat, and my body shivering uncontrollably. This is the third night in a row I dream of what happened 6 years ago when I moved into a small apartment with two other freshman students close to the university campus, in hopes that it would make my commute more tolerable. For the couple of months I lived with Syd and Cord I actually grew to like them, despite their many annoying little quirks.

One night at around 10:30 pm, as I was finishing up an assignment so I can sleep early, or that was at least what I convinced myself I would do when I recalled being a sleepy bag of misery and regret every morning, Syd and Cord walked into my room while arguing with each other. Now, I really hate it when anyone walks into my room without asking, especially when I am busy, but since my room's door was right in front of the living room and the kitchen, I came to accept the fact that unwanted guests will wander into my personal space every so often. 

This time their argument was about some silly bet they had and they could not decide who the winner was. "Hey you gotta help us solve this, Syd claimed that he can bench press 150 pounds, but he…", someone aggressively knocked on my window which was adjacent to the front door, we walked to the front door and we all yelled at the same time "WHO IS IT?" but nobody replied.

The person outside started trying to break in, running into the door, kicking it, and we thought there was no way this person could break a locked door without any tools. We tried looking through the door's peephole but it was too dark outside to see anything. I yell again and say "We are calling the police right now, so you better knock if off and leave before they get here". As we walk to my room the front door breaks and whoever… or whatever broke into our house could not stop its momentum and crashed into the table and chair that were in front of the door. Syd, Cord, and I all ran to my room as quickly as our legs allowed us to, and locked the door behind us. 

Cord starts losing it "WE ARE GONNA DIE, WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM US" he says as he jumps around, I tell him to shut up and to help Syd move the bed in front of the door as I call the police. Now, Cord and I shared the bathroom and the small hallway in front of it, so both our rooms had two doors, and the thought hit me that whatever was in our living room was just going to walk through Cord's room, I turn around and run to the other room to lock the door, and the boys follow me.

The moment I step into the room I see red eyes staring at me, and whatever it was attached to starts to move into the room in a disturbing manner. We freak out and run to the bathroom right behind us and lock the door and stand with our back to it in case this.. thing tries to break it like it broke the front door.

Good thing I already had my phone with me, I quickly call the police, "What's your situation?" asked a man in a firm voice. "Some..one is in our house, we are locked in the bathroom, please send help as soon as possible!", "Our address is 1755 East…", the agent interrupts me and says "We already have your location, a cop will be at your house in 3 minutes".

I turn to Syd and Cord and tell them "3 minutes boys, just relax we’ll be fine!", they both laugh nervously, and we wait in silence. 3 minutes  passed and nobody showed up, we wait another 3, and nothing. Cord starts crying "That's it man, that thing is gonna kill us before the stupid police show up", I grab the phone again, which for some reason only had 2% battery left, I could have sworn it was at 90% when I made the first call. 

I nervously call the police again and the same man answers "The cop arrived to your house 4 minutes ago, did he not find you yet?", I say "Uh no, we haven't…" and the phone switches off.. then I hear a static noise from the phone followed by a faint voice, I put it back on my ear and someone softly says "Don't worry, if I wanted to hurt you I would have already done so, come on my sweet child, open the door", I panic and throw the phone against the wall. My roommates look puzzled and frightened. "What was that for man?" Syd asked, "Uh it was nothing, they said the cop arrived 4 minutes ago, he might already be in the house".

None of us knew what to do at this point, should we stay and wait, or should we walk outside and see what is going on? I convince my roommates that we should go outside "It should be safe now, I mean, we haven't heard anything since we locked ourselves in the bathroom, I am sure that thing would have tried to break into here if it was still outside", they both nod in agreement.

We unlock the door and slowly walk into Cord's room, it was very dark, we can tell every light in the house was turned off, we open the room's door and… it has been years and I still do not know how to explain what I saw. The rest of the apartment was dark, very dark, with a faint fire in the far distance, and little purple.. particles were floating around, it looked like all the inner walls and furniture had somehow… vanished.

Syd and I hear noise in the distance, and we can tell something was moving towards us because of the way these strange purple particles were moving. I grab Syd's arm and yell at Cord to follow us, he was scrambling in his room for something, we all walk back into the bathroom and lock ourselves in again.

Cord says "Look guys, I brought my phone, I can call my parents and tell them to come get us!" and he pulls a bottle of juice out of his pocket. "What the hell, you know you can't make a call with that, right Cord?" Syd says in a sarcastic manner, yet I can tell he was still utterly terrified from what him and I saw outside, and that he might have noticed the strange movement too. Cord says "What is this, I swear I grabbed my phone, this is the first time I see this bottle of juice". We agree that the best thing to do was wait, we already called the police and they know we need help, they will eventually show up.

We spend the next few hours in the small crowded bathroom, we slowly felt hungry, thirsty, tired, scared, and a mix of other emotions. Syd attempted to hum a Michael Jackson’s song “You’ve been hit by, you’ve been struck by…”, “A smoooth criminal” the thing outside finished the verse, Syd stopped with apparent horror and regret on his face, we decided not to talk or make any noise to avoid drawing its attention. Cord has been quietly crying this whole time, and Syd decided that it was safe to drink toilet water.

A long time had passed, we occasionally heard noise outside, knocking, things being thrown around, and a loud scream. After a few long hours I was losing my mind, we lost track of time, and grew much more desperate, I looked at my wrist watch and it was 5 am, it has been close to 7 hours since Syd and Cord walked into my room earlier.

The light in the bathroom flickers twice and  then turns off. Cord screams in horror and opens the door and runs out, "WAIT!", "Syd you come with me, lets go get this fat idiot", "Syd?". I slowly walk out of the bathroom, now the floating purple particles had moved into Cord's room and mine. The beds, desks, and chairs are all gone, I try to calm myself down and mumble "it's just a robbery, a very terrifying one, but they probably never wanted to do us any harm in the first place". "That's right my child, I wouldn't hurt any of you, look I made cookies!" a soft and calm voice behind me said. I turn around me and see a short… person? Creature? It looked like a grandma in a green dress, but it had red glowing eyes, and a shadowy figure. I run the other way out of the room and towards the faint fire that flickered at the other end of this dark, long, empty void the house turned into.

I am terrified, my heart is pounding out of my chest, my legs are shaking, my eyes are teary.. why.. why is this happening to us? I run and I run, I might've ran for an hour or two, I couldn't tell, the fire I was pursuing was getting dimmer, and everything else around me looked the same, floating purple particles and.. nothing else. I eventually collapsed to the floor and passed out.

I woke up on the floor of our living room, the walls were back, but the furniture was still nowhere to be seem, along with literally everything that was in the house, pens, cups, clothes, food, the doormat, everything was gone. I walk around the house looking for my roommates. I think that it must have been a dream, I mean, maybe the robbery did happen but not the rest, I don't know. I search the house a million times, there is no traces of my roommates, everything is gone except for my phone in the bathroom next to a half eaten cookie , the phone had 86% battery this time.

I call the police first, they claimed they have not received a call from me last night, I call my parents and tell them to come over, and I call Cord's parents. "Um hello, I am sorry to tell you this but your son is missing, I do not know where he is" I said, "Who is this? If this is a prank then I do not have the time for it" Cord's father's familiar voice replied, "What do you mean a prank? I'm Cord's roommate, we met before, your son…" he hung up. I called Syd's mother and the response was similar "I don't have a son, please don't call again" *click*… I talked to the neighbors and our friends, nobody seemed to remember my roommates. 

To this day I still have no explanation for what happened six years ago, I have bad dreams about it, but I know for sure that it was NOT a dream, and I know that my roommates, my friends, Syd and Cord, did exist.
