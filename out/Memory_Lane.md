 

Have any of you ever experienced things that were theoretically impossible when you are younger, later dismissed as an illusion when you get older? But you do know that it was real and choose to ignore it since there are possible explanations for them. I am writing about some of such experiences I had while I was younger.

When I was like 3 or 4 I started seeing colors in the dark. They were like patterns or simply dots. It may stand still or move around like a wave in a soothing sort of way. They look like those desktop screensavers we had back then. I thought they were a dream at first but later realized it wasn't. 

It was not like a color would pop out whenever I look at the dark. More like I have to imagine it first then tiny dots appear which may or may not change into different colored patterns and move around me. They never stick to one color or pattern it continuously evolves surprising me with its intricate patterns and beautiful colors. Soon it starts to become a routine for me to meet them before going to sleep. I would lie in the bed thinking of it willing it to appear in front of me. There had been occasions where either i failed to make them appear or they appear without me thinking about it, it suddenly appears when I open my eyes and moves like it was dancing around me. It was magical and I was filled with excitement whenever I could conjure them up. I have tried catching it with my hand to prove it was real and when I did (I remember it was purple dots that looks like purple fireflies) I waited for the pattern to change into something like a blue and green ocean wave kinda thing and then released them from my hands to see the purple dots floating away which convinced me that whatever it was is not a dream. (p.s - I was 4 at that time). I had also made sure of pinching myself or calling for my older sister who slept in the same room with me at these moments too. One time I had even asked her if she could see this and she groggily confirmed it, probably to fulfill my fantasy, I don't think she even remembers it. Anyway until I was like 7 years old I kept doing it believing I have a cool superpower.

However, as I get older I realized the whole thing is ridiculous and stop thinking about it, they have never appeared in front of me again. Truthfully, I don't think I ever will, I can't deal with it if I see it again, at least now I could believe it as fantasies of a small child. It might be an illusion that my mind came up with or something else but it never felt bad. It was always like a warm friendly thing that cheers me up the moment it appears.

Now that I think about it, it is definitely strange but in a good way. I would like to know if this was some kind of a condition or did anyone else happen to have these kinds of experiences too.
