Well, I know it's another long shot posting here. No matter where I share my story online, I always get accused of being a troll. Every UFO and paranormal forum I've visited thinks my story is obviously made up. But I swear I am telling the truth.

Most of my family has died or went missing under mysterious circumstances over the years. As crazy as it sounds, I am convinced these were all due to alien abductions. This cannot be coincidence. 

The first was my aunt when I was 8. She was staying with my parents and I when she went missing. I was the only one who heard her leaving the house. I saw some sort of UFO outside clearly taking her away. There were no other witnesses. Her body was never found. Everyone thought I was just dreaming or wanted attention. 

Next was my grandfather when I was 11. They say he died of old age. But I am convinced he was buried alive and the body abducted by aliens from his casket. I know because the cemetery is very close to my house and I witnessed this with my own eyes. Of course no one believes me.

Then at age 15 I lost both of my parents in the span of 5 months. First was my dad in a car crash. The body was found, but it had mysterious markings no one could explain all over it. I believe this means he was abducted and returned after being experimented on. This time I wasn't there, but there actually were other witnesses who swear they saw a UFO and strange lights at the right place and time. Only I believe they're connected.

Five months later my mother left me home alone to go shopping and never returned. He body was found miles away in the wilderness with the same strange markings. Everyone says it's just a coincidence. 

Then at 18 one of my cousins was supposedly mauled to death by a bear in the woods. But I know it wasn't a bear because the markings were the same. They look like no animal markings I've ever seen.

Over the next few years the strange deaths in my family increased. The stories all very similar to the ones I've already shared. Yet everyone else just shuts me up when I insist it's not coincidence or that aliens could be involved. 

I've been to therapy and they always they to convince me I'm imagining things. After each death I try sharing my story online and am shot down. Everyone in my family thinks I'm being insensitive. But I'm not. I swear I even see the aliens sometimes. It feels like they're stalking my family. Yet no one else ever notices them.

The strangest part I have yet to mention? I tend to have very strange dreams right before the mysterious deaths. Each one a little more specific of a prediction of what is about to happen then the last. And well, I'm next.
