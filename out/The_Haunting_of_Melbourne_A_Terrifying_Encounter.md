Sarah and Tom, a young couple in their mid-30s, were strolling around the lively city of Melbourne, Australia on a warm summer evening. The hustle and bustle of the city soon faded away as they ventured down a desolate alleyway.

The air suddenly turned chilly, and a strange silence filled the alleyway. The trees rustled, but the leaves sounded like whispers. The streetlights flickered before they extinguished, leaving the couple stranded in complete darkness.

As they fumbled for their phones, they realized that their screens remained blank. A chilling voice crept out of the shadows behind them, whispering their names. They turned around slowly, and there it was - a cloaked figure with no face but glowing eyes. The figure beckoned them to follow.

Their instincts told them to run, but their legs were frozen in terror. The figure walked towards them with heavy footsteps, and they couldn't move an inch. It towered over them, and they felt like they were staring at their own death.

"Who are you?" Sarah managed to stutter.

The figure didn't answer, but instead continued to beckon them to follow. As they reluctantly followed the cloaked figure, they could hear the sound of their own heartbeats, the only sound besides their footsteps.

They were led to an old, decrepit house at the end of the alleyway. The figure pointed to the door, and they hesitantly entered. Inside, the house was filled with old, dusty furniture, and the air was thick with the scent of mildew.

They could hear whispers coming from the walls, and the floorboards creaked under their feet. A cold breeze passed through the room, and they shivered in fear. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash, and a bookcase fell over, narrowly missing them.

They turned to run, but the door was blocked by the cloaked figure. It towered over them once again, and its glowing eyes bore into theirs. They were trapped.

After their encounter with the cloaked figure, Sarah and Tom's lives were never the same. The once peaceful couple was tormented by unexplainable occurrences - objects moving on their own, whispers in their ears, and shadows flickering on the walls. The figure seemed to haunt them, and they felt like they were never alone.

One night, they were awakened by loud banging on their front door. They looked through the peephole, but no one was there. A cold breath brushed the back of their necks, and they shivered in fear.

The figure appeared once again, its glowing eyes fixated on them. It beckoned them to follow, and they obeyed. They followed the figure as it retreated down the hallway and into a hidden door.

The door creaked open, revealing a room filled with dust and cobwebs. An old, open book lay on a pedestal in the center of the room. They drew closer, and the book snapped shut, plunging the room into darkness.

A deafening scream echoed through the room, and a cold hand brushed their faces. When the lights came back on, they were back in their bedroom. The room was in shambles, and they were covered in scratches and bruises.

They could hear the figure's chilling laughter echoing through the halls, and they knew they were never truly alone. From that day on, they never talked about their experience, and they never ventured down that alleyway again.

The figure had left its mark on them, and they knew that it would haunt them for the rest of their lives. They felt like they were being watched, like they were never truly safe. The cloaked figure was always lurking, waiting for its next victim.
