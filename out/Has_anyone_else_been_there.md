Have you ever looked at the horizon of a public area when there are people walking and going on about their lives? Maybe you found someone who you think is attractive on the crowd or was trying to find a place to eat something, maybe you are among those who just simply turn off a bit.

&#x200B;

Its bit different for me, it always seems like its all just a dream, let me explain: 

&#x200B;

I am used to saying that my first ever memory is not very clear, but I was sitting on a bed and a man came in the room, open the wardrobe, got something out that I think was a wallet, smiled and said something at me, and got out, my mom tells me that this was a boyfriend she had when I was 2 or 3 years old.

&#x200B;

But the reality is that my first memory is from another woman who felt like my mother holding me tight while burning wood fell on to us, i was past 10 years old.

&#x200B;

So what happens is, every time I sleep, I wake up in another world

&#x200B;

One that is something like a post a biblical apocalyptic word filled up with monsters, demons, shadow people, mythological creatures and anything else that could make life harder for a human, people there seem to be cursed because when they "die" for any reason their body just stay there without decaying until night and at night they become a shadow humanoid that act just like a zombie, if this thing is beaten the person can be brought back, but I can only describe them as having PTSD. 

&#x200B;

People don't age and normally can't have kids there neither, they just live trying their best not to get "killed".

&#x200B;

I can sleep there, but the only dreams are about a world without monsters where people get angry for dumb reasons and get worried about things that won't end their lives.

&#x200B;

As you might have guessed, the dreams are about the world you live in, but they happen only once maybe twice a week for me, so you can say that one day for you is 7 for me, something like that.

&#x200B;

In here I was always the weird kid, not very good at making friends or talking to others but always knew more than kids my age, probably because my mind was older.

&#x200B;

And I see things here too, as if there are multiple realities existing on the same plane, I see people going about their lives not knowing of this earth, but I also see more specific things like Thalia, a girl who calls herself a demon and always been at my side telling me stuff, helping me on tests, telling me about people and more.

&#x200B;

And also a bit less specific things, like those online videos where security cameras catch ghosts or creatures but no one saw them? I do.

&#x200B;

And every 28 days here, I have a very specific dream, an empty white room with a metal chair, no doors nor windows, a voice asks me to sit down, I do, then the voice start asking me about the experiences I had this past month, how I felt about certain things, and then the voice says "alright, we are done for today, see you next time" and I just wake up, instantly. 

&#x200B;

I am 24 now, you can say that I am past 190 years, I have spent my entire life looking for an answer to what is the real.

&#x200B;

Always studied science and math, computers too, anything that could remotely make any sense I already tried, religion too.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed as schizophrenic as a kid, but I don't think that's right.

Why?Well.

&#x200B;

We tested it, I was convinced that this happened to more people, so I found someone on the other world and gave her a very specific instruction to do when she woke up, we'd meet on a place and say 2 words which were decided on the other world, so connection to reality was impossible, to be sure we'd both bring one friend and on the way say to that friend the word the other person would respond, neither of us knew each other because we both lived at different sides of the country, the meeting place was a mall and just as planned, everything went as planned? Friends confirmed too, it was something real, not only in my mind so what does it mean? 

&#x200B;

There is one more specific entity that I see, not always, but often, it started appearing when I started thinking about suicide because of how much I'm tired of all of this.

&#x200B;

It is a man that I can't describe the face, not because it has no face but his face is so... unremarkable? It has a nose, a mouth, eyebrows, the only thing that is not normal on his face is that his eyes are white as if emanating light of it, he wars a black suit and show no emotion at all, speaks in a very calm manner and mostly speaks about the concept of things, like intention, will, existence and anything else that could have a fundamental concept, but here is the creepy part

&#x200B;

On my worst days... when I feel like I was just a weight to everyone, that nothing feels real, that there is no meaning to any of it, that I could just give up and rest... He comes up to me, grabs my arm, get eye to eye and say

&#x200B;

"I made people like you. I don't expect you to forgive me as I don't care what you think not knowing the full extent of the existence but don't ever forget"

&#x200B;

At this moment inside the white from his eyes I see the other world and its like I become omniscient for a moment, as if I know where everyone and everything in that world is, and I know they want to come here too.

&#x200B;

"You know what they want. You have seen it"
