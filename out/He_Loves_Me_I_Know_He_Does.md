He loves me. He is always there by my side. He always look at me. He smiles at me. I shall do something special to express my gratitude for his love.

I signed for a job and I just got accepted. I am so thrilled, I finally have a job. It is not that easy to find a job. It took me a year to finally get accepted. Tomorrow will be my first day. I hope things will go well. 

Fast forward, today is the day. I am already at my work. As I walked down the hallway, I suddenly bumped to a man, how can I be so careless. As I looked at his eyes, I can feel my heart beating fast, it was a feeling of romantic exhilaration. What is this feeling? I do not believe in love-at-first-sight, nevertheless, I think it is happening to me right now. He apologized to me and already left. I did not get a chance to ask his name.

The next day, I found him again. It is my chance to talk to him. I approached him and we got along well. I finally got his name, I will not tell his name for privacy. We became really close to each other. We always talk about interesting topics. We are always attached to each other that everyone always mistakes us as a couple. As time goes on, I was ready to confess my love for him, I loved him since the first day but that would soon change. 

We had a new colleague and he talks about her often. I was annoyed and irritated whenever he talks about her, yet, I have to play along. Months later, I soon found out that they were already in a relationship. I was hurt. I was the first. Frustrated, devastated, disappointed. This is unacceptable.

I invited her to my house, I wanted to congratulate her for stealing my man, and we talked about the things he likes. She should not have came to my house. She knew that I loved him more than ever but she still stole him from me. The next day, I found out that she went missing. 

My poor beloved man, he always cry and is out of his mind. We reported her to policemen as a missing person. It has been 1 week and no one still has a clue about her. No traces, nothing at all.

I confronted him and invited him to my house, he did not mind the foul-smelling in my kitchen. He probably keeps thinking about his girlfriend that he did not noticed the smell which is a good thing. As we talked about his girlfriend, everything would suddenly change. 

He now loves me. I knew I was the one. He was screaming, he is probably celebrating our new relationship and as for my gift and appreciation, I cleaned the basement and fixed his needle stuck in his mouth up to his cheek. He now smiles wider.
