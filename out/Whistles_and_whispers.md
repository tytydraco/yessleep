So yesterday, my BF and I had a super long draining day and we got some bad news. However, we needed to finish setting up the electricity in the basement for our new heating system and so we worked until around 11pm. 

When I went to bed, our bedroom was so cold, even with the two heavy wool blankets I had on, the little heater going and a heating blanket. I juste couldn't get warm and eventually started having a panic attack. My Bf stayed with me until I was able to calm down and he tehn went in his office in the next room to game, as he usually does. 

He came back an hour later and chilled on his phone for a few minutes before dozing off. TBH, I dont know how much time had passed after that, but my boyfriend jolted out of bed and rushed downstairs. I was not worried because none of our dogs had any reaction. 

When he came back he said that something is off, something is wrong. Like time has stopped, something creepy is around, something bad. He said the basement was extra gloomy,without knowing why and that the Christmas lights were shimmering in a weird pattern. Its too quiet he said. I could just hear so many things while laying in bed and he heard a whistle right on our porch and then knocks on the wall,and he could hear faint voices of men speaking. 

Mind you earlier that day, I had the same experience and had asked him : Did you say something? And kept hearing the same distant whispers of men for a few minutes. When he came back in the room and ssid something was wrong, I felt all the hair on my body rise up but pretended like I didn't feel anything since he was already fo freaked out. 

He is usually not much in tune with anything around him, so that was definitely out of character so I took it seriously and proposed a middle-of-the-night car ride to shake it off. At one point, he started feeling morre eerie and decided to change direction on the highway and that is where we landed in a deep ass fog for about 5 minutes. We couldn't see pass the hood, and were surrounded by a thick gloomy fog. 

We eventually drove out of it and my boyfriend casually said, I feel good now, its passed. We came back home but I still felt creeped out, but didn't want to show it to him. He fell asleep but I just couldn't. I kept hearing a muffled thud outside and eventually my dog got awoken by one of them and started freaking out, but My Bf never woke up.

It is not the first time we hear whistles and knocking, this is an olllllld patrimonial house with lots of history. But this was the first time we both felt it. 

What the hell was that!?! Did we die ??
