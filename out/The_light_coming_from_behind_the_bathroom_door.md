Hello, sorry if I sound weird writing this post, I haven't had a conversation with a human in years.

My story goes as the following, I was a happy man married to the most beautiful woman in the world, I will keep my and my wife's identity a secret, I don't trust people anymore.

Me and my wife were married for 8 years, I had a well paying job and we were both happy, atleast that's what I thought.

One day after coming home from work, I called out to my wife, I didn't get an answer, I thought she was maybe asleep so I went to the bedroom and check on her, she wasn't there.

I checked every room in the house, and then I checked the bathroom, it was locked.

I called out to her, no response, I knocked, no response, I kept knocking so hard, no response.

I was starting to get worried, I kept having thoughts, Terrible thoughts of what may have happened to her.

So I broke down the door, and I found her, laying on the floor unconscious, with pills scattered all over the floor. She overdosed. She killed herself.

I hurried and called the police and they rushed her to the hospital, but it was no use, she was gone.

Why? Why did she do this to us? Why did she do this to me?

After her death, I felt empty, I felt like there was nothing worth living for, I wanted to die, but I was too afraid to end my own life, I am such a coward.

To reduce the pain I was feeling, or atleast that's what I convinced myself I was doing, I started drinking, and I didn't go out much except to go to work, I wasn't feeling the best at work, I didn't feel like working, I didn't feel like talking to people, I didn't feel like doing anything.

So I quit my job, I stayed home, and I stayed away from all of my family and friends, I blocked all the windows with objects around the house, the only time I interacted with people was when I ordered food or beer, I was planning to continue like this until I died. It was my best shot at dying without actually killing myself. I of course was too scared to do so.

One night, I was very high, I drunk a lot, I was going to throw up so I went to the bathroom, but something caught the glimpse of my eye, on the way, the door to the bathroom was open, but it was barely open, but open just enough to see the inside.

What caught my eye was there was light coming from it, a very bright light, when I entered the room, the light disappeared, I ignored it, maybe it was from the window.

After I threw up and washed my face and could realize what's going on around me, I noticed something, remember when I said I covered all the windows with objects from around the house? Yeah, well there was a very large cupboard covering the only window in this bathroom, so the light couldn't have come through there, and the lights of this bathroom are dead and I didn't bother getting them fixed because in a mental state like mine, why would you care about a light?

This is the first time in years I've felt concerned, it's finally like I am actually putting thought into something, but that thought died off pretty quickly, as I ruled it out to be me being just really drunk.

The next night, I was sitting on the couch watching TV, I didn't drink a single beer, I went to the bathroom to pee, and there it was. The light.

I remember closing the door to the bathroom last night, but the door was open, the same way it was last night. Just enough to see that bright light. I stayed still, frozen, just watching that light. I felt like it was calling to me. I don't know why but that light. It felt nice. It felt warming.

After standing there like an idiot for a few minutes, I entered the bathroom, to see the light has disappeared again.

This light, it gave me the best feeling I've felt in years, I would love to just stay there, I would love to get closer to it without it disappearing.

It reminds me of something, it reminds me of someone. My wife.

I thought about it for a second, this is the same bathroom my wife killed herself in. Is it my wife calling for me? Does it mean we can finally be together once again?

I wanted to see that light once again, and I did, every night I went to the bathroom to check, and the light was there, everytime the light got stronger, the great feeling it gave got stronger. But whenever I entered the bathroom, it disappeared.

On the 18th night of this happening, while I was sitting outside the door, looking at the light, I thought to myself, is this light even real? What if it's just in my head? What if it just appeared because of my terrible state? I didn't care, it was the only thing that kept me company in this lonely house, the only thing that kept me happy.

Right after those thoughts stopped lingering in my mind, something happened.

The door opened. Fully opened this time. It's opened to the point I can enter the room and see the light clearly.

Coming from the light's direction, I heard my wife, calling for me.

"Everything is going to be okay, You can be with me now, we can be together. Forever. Just come through the door and we'll be together."

My heart was beating faster than it ever has, I can finally be with my wife, Without hesitation, I rushed to the door.

Since I never really explained it much, the bathroom door had a wall in front of it not that far from it. That's where I always sat looking at the light. The walk from the wall to the bathroom door would take two seconds. But for me, it felt like 15 minutes of just running, feeling like I am getting closer to finally being with my wife, I don't know if it was my mind playing tricks on me or what.

Right as I was about to enter the door, I stopped.

I thought to myself, what if this is a trap?

I may be losing my mind, I may be insane, I may be not in touch with reality.

But one thing for certain, I know my wife is dead. She's not alive. This is all in my head. That's what I thought.

After this thought came into my head, the light disappeared, the light was replaced by a dark aura coming from the bathroom, something dark was trying to grab me in. But I ran away from the bathroom as fast as I could. The thing was almost like a hand, but its fingers were razor sharp, and it was all black, it managed to scratch me with its fingers and I started to bleed but I ran away.

And I wasn't imagining, the wound was real.

I came back to the bathroom the next day, and the bathroom was normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Nothing happened after that, it's been a few days since that happened. And I don't know what to do. I didn't want to contact my family or friends because I think they'll find me insane. I need help from you, guys of the internet. You're my only hope.

I am scared that the light may come back, or even worse, the darkness, That thing, it may come back.

What do I do? Is this an answer to my prayers? Is this an answer to my wish of dying and leaving this cruel world behind?

I keep hearing her voice. I want to follow it.
