**The Forgotten Broadcast**

Late one evening, Ethan was sifting through old, dusty boxes in his attic. Amidst forgotten knick-knacks and faded photographs, he stumbled upon an old VHS tape. The label was barely legible but read: "Luther's Final Broadcast."

Intrigued, Ethan found an old VHS player and watched the tape. The screen flickered before showing a dimly lit room with a single desk and a camera. The video showed a man, Luther, speaking directly into the camera with a weary expression.

"Hello," Luther began, his voice strained. "If you’re watching this, it means I’m no longer here. And I need to tell you what happened."

Ethan leaned in closer, captivated. Luther described his job as a late-night radio host, known for his eerie and unsettling stories. But recently, something had changed. He had started receiving strange, anonymous messages hinting at a dark secret.

The tape cut to a segment of Luther's show, where his voice trembled as he read a chilling story about a cursed broadcast. The story detailed a radio signal that once heard, would lead the listener to a place of unspeakable horror.

The next segment of the tape showed Luther in his studio, surrounded by ominous shadows. His face was pale, and his eyes darted nervously around the room.

“I tried to ignore it,” Luther said, “but the messages kept coming, becoming more frequent and more terrifying. They warned me about a place... a place that should never be found.”

Suddenly, the camera cut to a live feed of the studio’s front door. It creaked open, revealing a dark figure standing in the doorway. Luther's breathing became ragged as he grabbed a flashlight and approached the door. The figure remained motionless.

Luther’s voice cracked. “I have to go. They’re here.”

The screen went black. A few seconds later, the video resumed with static, showing only the empty studio. The tape ended with a brief, unsettling clip of a distorted face, its eyes wide and hollow.

Ethan rewound the tape, trying to make sense of what he had seen. He noticed a peculiar detail: the static at the end seemed to form a pattern, almost like a map. He hesitated but felt compelled to investigate further.

The next day, Ethan followed the map’s coordinates, leading him to a remote, abandoned building on the edge of town. The place was eerily quiet, and the air felt heavy. He found a small room filled with old radios and recording equipment.

In the corner, there was a dusty old radio transmitter with a note taped to it. The note read: “If you’re reading this, you’ve found the place. Now, you must understand the message.”

As Ethan stared at the transmitter, he noticed that the same ominous figure from the video appeared on a monitor in the room, its hollow eyes gazing at him. Panic surged through him, but he felt drawn to the transmitter, compelled to turn it on.

The room filled with static, then a voice emerged from the radio, distorted and echoing. It spoke of a dark presence that thrived on fear and despair, luring unsuspecting souls into its grasp. Ethan realized the broadcast was not just a story—it was a trap.

Suddenly, the temperature in the room dropped. Ethan’s breath turned visible as shadows began to swirl around him. He tried to leave, but the door slammed shut.

Desperate, Ethan reached for the transmitter’s controls, hoping to end the broadcast. But before he could act, the figure from the video materialized in front of him, its eyes glowing with an unnatural light.

Ethan’s last moments were filled with an overwhelming sense of dread and terror as the presence enveloped him. The room fell silent once more.

The VHS tape was found later, lying on the dusty floor of the abandoned building, its label still barely legible: “Luther’s Final Broadcast.”
