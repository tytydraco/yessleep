The cycle of running for my life and losing consciousness was getting old. I supposed this time I felt safer being in the hotel room. I was grateful no one had captured me while I slept, though I wondered if I had truly slept at all. I was not sure, but the bloody three on my hand, reminded me that sleep was not the concern just then.

I did not have long to consider my situation or appreciate my freedom when something ended up coming to me. I heard the door creak open and then a small metallic clatter on the floor. Suddenly I was blinded by a flash of light and a deafening explosion.

I managed to stay conscious and fell back to avoid a strike aimed at my head. I looked up and saw two people wearing gargoyle masks. I held up my hands and tried to get them to stop.

“Wait, I don’t know what's going on, but I did not do anything. Don't kill me! I heard from the scientists that there is a cure. Whatever is wrong with me can be fixed, at least I think so.” The masked figures paused. They regarded each other after a moment and then looked back to me.

One of them stepped forward and pulled out what looked like a silver chain.

“Come with us then, if you truly wish to test your innocence, you might help us yet. But if you betray us or try to infect more with the curse, we will burn you alive.”

I looked around, desperate for an avenue of escape, but I saw no way to get out of there while both of them were after me. I saw what just one of them was capable of in the bunker I was kept at before. I did not want to fight two of them now. Even if they killed me, I supposed I would at least get some answers on what the hell was going on first.

I allowed one of the figures to wrap the silver chain around my hands and despite the chain not being pulled completely tight, the surface seemed to irritate and burn my skin. The area around my hand was positively throbbing and I almost cried out from the discomfort.

The two watched my reaction impassively, though I suspected they wore some reaction to my suffering  behind the masks. We quickly walked to a plain looking white van outside and I was beginning to fear I had made a terrible mistake.

We drove what felt like an hour, though I had no idea exactly how long in truth. Like some sort of black op I had a burlap sack put over my head as we traveled, in case I might somehow lead others to whatever base of operations these bizarre people called home.

When we arrived I was marched out of the vehicle and walked for a while till I was told to stop. I felt my blood heating up again, something about where I was standing was causing the strange feeling again, like it was trying to get out before I took another step.

I fell to my knees and thought I might be sick. I felt a hand on my shoulder and the sting of electricity as I was shocked by some sort of taser. After convulsing for a moment I recovered. I had cried out,

“What the hell was that for?” Yet before I heard an answer I noticed the strange feeling was gone. I no longer felt sick my blood had been calmed. A voice finally responded,

“For safety, I am sorry, we do no often bring your kind back here. The danger is great and I am not sure if Lewis and Fredrick made the right decision in trying to bring you in, but you are here now and we can always kill you later if the plan fails.”

I had no idea what plan they were referring to, but I had little choice but to cooperate if at least to find out what was wrong with me. I was marched into another room and I heard a door closing. Someone pulled the bag from my head and I looked at a large figure in an even more ornate gargoyle mask than the others. The snarling visage was intricately carved and seemed to have gems studded in various sections of the mask.

They stared at me for a short while and I felt uncomfortable as my eyes adjusted to the harsh light of the room and the glare of that same light reflected off the brilliant surface of the mask. Before I could ask anything the figure spoke.

“Welcome tainted one. The first and most important question I must ask is have you fed the blood curse yet? If you have fed already then this is a wasted effort and we should save time and kill you in a much swifter and less painful manner."

I considered the question and the assertion they were going to kill me. I did not know what they meant by “Fed the blood curse.” I had not eaten anyone or drank someone's blood like a Goddamn vampire. At least I did not remember ever doing anything like that.

I responded honestly,

“No, no I have not fed whatever this thing is. Please tell me what is happening to me? Am I going to die?”

The figure paused and reached his hand to his chin, like he was considering carefully before responding.

“Perhaps, perhaps not. We will see. Either way this will be grueling, you will have pain inflicted on you, but your soul might be saved yet. The time left in your blood, claims you still have hope, if only a few days now. But I cannot promise this will work, it could cleanse you but you may still die, yet I am afraid we cannot risk leaving you to spread the curse further or worse, become something altogether different....when your time is up.”

I looked at him doubtfully and he spoke again,

“I will not lie the chance is slim, but I will not deceive you about our intentions, in fact I will tell you a bit more about what is happening. You will either die or live knowing that you can never share the secrets you find out here as long as you continue to live.” He stretched out his hands, gesturing to the building around us.

“This is the hall of atonement. You are currently being held by our group, the society of Hermes. We are a clandestine group of warriors and healers who keep the people safe from the physical and sometimes supernatural threats that might menace all of mankind. It just so happens that you have found yourself involved in our little struggle against a very pernicious foe.” I could not believe what the man was saying, I was listening to him talk about secret societies and hidden wars. It sounded crazy, but he continues without even regarding the incredulous look on my face.

“The blood phages are a curse. A sentient and spiritual disease that passes on from people to people by bloodborne transmission. I will tell you more about them if you survive, but for now the time is short. You were infected when you came into contact with a specimen that one of out purgation groups was hunting down. Once they have fed, the curse is unbreakable, but for those who haven't, for those whose blood might still be saved we have a method that could heal you.”

“You must believe that we never meant to kill the people inflicted by this curse, it is only as a last resort that we have been forced to. Yet so many have been lost, our hearts have hardened and we have been forced to act. You however might be the first one we can save from this nightmare.” He gestured to two others in the room with us and I was grabbed by each arm and brought to another room. Inside there was a large machine with tubes snaking into odd looking machinery. A bed lay in the center and I was placed on it.

I started to sweat and the fear and burning blood sensation began again. Something felt like it was trying to get out and I remembered the name the masked man had given this curse I was apparently inflicted with, Blood phages.

I flinched as they led me to the bed. I was strapped down and the two men insisted that once it started, the creature might try and escape.

Needles were inserted into veins and I heard pumps whirring and starting. I had no idea what they were doing but I considered this thing might be some sort of arcane dialysis machine.

The thing in my blood raged and I screamed out in a feral roar that did not sound like myself. I thrashed at the restraints and I felt the horror emerging from my skin. A electric charge struck me before I lost myself and I felt dizzy as the blood pumped out of my body.

I dimly heard a low chanting and saw figures in the gargoyle masks chanting something, a prayer maybe?

I heard a voice interrupt the chanting,

“They are coming, they are going to try and save their foul seed.”

I saw several of the masked figures grab these oddly shaped objects. Suddenly the strange things they held let loose a small gout of flame and I realized the ornamental objects they held appeared to function as short range flame throwers.

The machine continued its work and I saw blood being drained from my body. The color was all wrong and seeing the fluid leave my veins made me feel strange. I thought I would be relieved but I felt angry.

Something felt wrong, it felt like my guts were twisting, I felt a strange echoing call in my head, a voice I hadn't heard since I had escaped the facility with the scientists, who were also trying to “Cure” me. The voice spoke into my mind again,

“Do not let them take us away, you need us.....kill them!” I felt a surge of anger and adrenaline but before I could act on it I felt the sting of electricity again and the shock made the voice recede.

My mind felt like itself again, but suddenly a creeping dread fell across the room and in the next instant the lights died and backup lights came on. The dim glow was just enough to make out a horrifying sight.

The fluid in the tank, the blood that was being drained from me was writhing and moving. I began to feel lightheaded and I wondered if they were going to kill me after all. The amount seemed prodigious but I was not dead, not yet at least.

The last thing I saw before I passed out again was a brilliant light from several flames all at once, engulfing the tainted blood. The death scream I heard heralded my loss of consciousness.

When I woke up I had no idea how long it had been. I felt weak and drained, but I was alive. I saw the restraints were gone and I looked to my hand and I let a sigh of relief out when I saw the bloody number was gone. The cure or whatever they had done had worked.

I heard the door to my room open and the man in the ornate gargoyle mask entered.

“Please, save your strength. We have much to discuss, there are others you have contacted, they might need our ministrations. You must help us before it is too late.”

I nodded my head and thought about Cassandra and knew that this was not over yet.
