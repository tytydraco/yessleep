&#x200B;

Things were personal now. I didn't sleep the night we went to visit Brice. It was due to equal parts worry for him and that Sheila probably wouldn’t be speaking to me anymore. There was only one thing to do. I had to make it right.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t know if killing the shapeshifter would cure Brice.  I had to try something. This time I was the one knocking on Dean and Stella’s doors.  I waited in the hall for them to get ready. At breakfast, I brought up what I thought would be the best course of action.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think we should see the mayor.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean sipped his coffee, then sat it down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I  was thinking the same thing,” he said. “If he knew what it's really capable of, chances are he’s hiding something else from us. What do you think, Stella? Do you want to head over there?”

&#x200B;

“That’s fine by me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella was less talkative than usual and I  knew that was my fault. Add that to the long list of things making me feel like garbage. The mayor’s staff was hesitant to let us through. However, they were persuaded by Stella’s badge accompanied by some choice words from her.  In short, they involved them never being able to work in that town again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I  had to describe Lester Christian in a word, it would be skittish. He looked about ready to jump out his window when we stepped into his office. Instead, he straightened himself out and gave his best, used car salesman, smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You must be the agents that were sent out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He extended a hand. Seeing none of us would shake it, he awkwardly attracted it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How is the mission going?”  he asked with a tinge of nervousness.

&#x200B;

“Were you aware that the shapeshifter could change into things other than humans?”  I asked, not beating around the bush.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It only took a split second of hesitation on his part for us to know he’d try to squirm out of our questions in any way he could.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ve been going by the reports in town.”

&#x200B;

“Alright, let us see them then.”

&#x200B;

“Pardon?”

&#x200B;

“Let us see the reports ourselves.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He made some spiel about that taking too long and how he wasn’t even sure he would be allowed to.  Maybe it was due to what was happening to Brice or maybe it was my lack of sleep, but I lost it, grabbing Lester by the color and yanking him towards him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Listen you fucking snake. My friend is on death’s door possibly because of information you kept from us, so if you don’t give that to us I swear....”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A hand grasped my shoulder. Dean shook his head at me. I drew in a breath and exhaled, releasing my grip on Lester’s collar. His breathing was rapid now as he collected himself. I stepped away and ran a finger through my hair, scolding myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What was I thinking? Agent or not, I threatened an elected official. I let my emotions overwhelm me. From then on, I stood back and watched Dean and Stella talk to Lester.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You need to do a better job at keeping him under control,” he shakily said.

&#x200B;

“Our apologies, Mayor,” Stella replied, “he’s under a lot of stress and he’s still learning.”

&#x200B;

“I should have him thrown in jail for that.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was about to interject when thankfully Stella got out her words first.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And what do you think will happen to you if people found out what you’ve been hiding?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lester’s face drained of color.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You can’t do that,” he protested.

&#x200B;

“Actually, we can,” Dean said. “If a matter concerns public safety,  our authority takes precedence.”

&#x200B;

“Not to mention,” Stella added, “what do you think we’d fine if  we did a little digging on you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lester was caught between a rock and a hard place that were both trying to squeeze him dry.  He let out a defeated sigh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“If I tell you everything, do you swear to keep this under wraps?”  he asked meekly.

&#x200B;

“You have our word,” Dean replied. "Isn't that right, Zane?"

&#x200B;

"Fine," I reluctantly agreed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lester unlocked a desk in his drawer and pulled out a stack of files. He opened them to reveal several excerpts from different journal entries, detailing strange sightings. One person said it took on the form of his dead wife. Another explained that it almost had her by taking on the appearance of her sister. There were others along with these that I glimpsed during our talk with the mayor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"This thing goes way back and I wasn't even aware of it until the attacks started occurring."

&#x200B;

"How far back are we talking?" Dean inquired.

&#x200B;

"Since the days of the Natives, maybe even longer. I had some people try to interview them for possible leads. Unfortunately, I'm afraid they aren't too keen on answering our questions."

&#x200B;

"Then maybe we should pay them a visit. Before we go, we’ll need a copy of these files.”

&#x200B;

“Very well, I’ll have that brought to you right away.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The reservation in question was an offshoot of people in the Hinono'eiteen tribe. I don’t know the full history, other than that theirs was established in the early 1900s.  Unfortunately, like many in the US, the circumstances surrounding that between them and the government were shady at best. As you can imagine, this was going to make things challenging for us. Nonetheless, we were going to try.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We headed to the reservation after our visit to the Mayor.  Judging by the conditions of the homes, it wasn’t difficult to understand why they didn’t want to cooperate with his staff. We never had a reason to go there before.  Seeing it now, I knew this was going to be harder than we anticipated. Through much persuasion and mentioning we didn’t work for Lester, we were allowed to see the leader, a woman by the name of Kaiah Bernard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though, we weren’t directly involved with the mayor, that didn’t mean she would welcome us with open arms. While waiting for her to be free to meet us, we skimmed through the records again, not getting much else from them or so we thought. We met her in her office. There was a weary yet proud quality to her.  Stella approached her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Good evening,  Ms. Bernard.,” she said and introduced all of us. “We’re here on an investigation regarding the attacks occurring throughout town. Would you happen to know anything about that?”

&#x200B;

“Even if I did, what reason do I have to tell you? Forgive my bluntness, but I fail to see why I should offer any assistance.”

&#x200B;

“Aren’t you worried about your people?” Dean asked.

&#x200B;

“It likes easy targets and we know how to avoid it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unlike Lester, this woman had a spine so the same tactic to get information wouldn’t work. Even if it would, it was clear she had a lot on her shoulders and I didn’t want to add to that burden.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys,” I spoke softly, causing Dean and Stella to look at me. “Could I speak to Ms. Bernard alone?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They studied me for a moment, then exchanged a glance. Dean shrugged and then they left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What business does a kid like you even have here anyway? Are you here for a school project or something?”

&#x200B;

“Do you have any friends who live here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The question seemed to catch her off guard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I consider myself a friend of everyone on the reservation.  Frankly, I don’t understand what you’re getting at.”

&#x200B;

“A friend of mine is in a coma right now because of that thing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her expression while still hardened, dropped slightly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don’t want to give you a sob story, I’m just trying to help him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My fists clenched again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He came all this way to see another friend of ours and because I didn’t warn them about that thing…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For the first time in the conversation, Kaiah’s expression softened, albeit only slightly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Look, I can understand how you feel,  but to cooperate with that weasel of a mayor would be costing us the only bargaining chip we’ve had in over a century.”

&#x200B;

“What do you mean?”

&#x200B;

“Call your peers back in. They’ll need to hear this too.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She explained that the shapeshifter was a being her people had been dealing with for generations. Nobody knew where it came from, only that it appeared once every fifty years.  When it showed up again, it was always someone from the tribe that would eventually stop it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ve had to risk ourselves for generations for almost nothing in return. Nearly every agreement was reneged. Do you see why now I can’t let this opportunity go to waste?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She had a point. The people living on the reservation were struggling at best and she had some leverage to finally change that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why don’t you agree to meet the mayor then and make a deal?” Dean asked.

&#x200B;

“Have you met the man?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her point was taken. We asked if she would mind if we stepped out to discuss things. She told us that would be fine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is there any way we can help?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“It’s difficult to say,” Dean replied. “We did tell Lester we wouldn’t blackmail him anymore.“

&#x200B;

“So what? It’s not like he doesn’t lie.”

“If he thinks he can’t trust us, it could be difficult to get his cooperation again if we need it.”

&#x200B;

“Hang on,” Stella interjected. “All we said is that we wouldn’t try to find any skeletons in his closet. We never said nobody else could.”

&#x200B;

“What exactly are you getting at?” Dean asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shortly later, we were back inside Kaiah’s office with a copy of the files we received from the mayor’s office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ms. Bernard, what would you need to help?” Stella asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kaiah briefly regarded the files that I was currently holding.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’d need some form of record our written proof. Every time one was made between my tribe and the town, the documents that were made would somehow always get lost. I’m sure you can infer how.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella held out a hand to me which I placed the files in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, what if I told you these records contained scans of journal entries from Government officials who lived in town? Not only that but what if I told you it just so happens that those entries contain passages directly referring to agreements the town made to your tribe?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kaiah’s tired eyes lit up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you think that could help us?” she asked.

&#x200B;

“With a good enough lawyer,” Stella replied. “We can get one for you if you help us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kaiah tapped a finger on her desk in thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“May I see the files first?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella did one better and showed her the specific journal scans that proved of the agreements. The second thing that happened for the first time since we met Kaiah was her smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You have a deal. Now, listen closely.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She explained to us the method her tribe used to stop the shapeshifter. Apparently, it was some kind of ritual dance, They’d use someone to lure it out and then perform the ritual which would force it back into hibernation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Will this help the people who are in the hospital because of it?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“It might. I’m afraid I can’t make any guarantees. It depends on how far along the sickness is.”

&#x200B;

“Do you think killing it would work?”

&#x200B;

“Maybe, but nobody’s been able to.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All I could do was hope the plan would help cure Brice.  It took a day of preparation. I stayed up all night helping. The main thing we needed now was someone to draw it and I was more than up for the challenge. That didn’t mean I wasn’t on edge.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, I knew the longer we waited, the less chance I’d have of saving Brice. Dean and Stella tried to talk me out of it, to which I responded that since I’d been the one to hit it, I was most qualified to face it. Besides, I was hyped up on energy shots. While not healthy, it would help me focus. Dusk was fast approaching and we knew the shapeshifter wouldn’t be far behind.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kaiah waited outside along with some other  Hinono'eiteens. They were dressed in preparation for the banishing ritual, some kind of dance with drums and pipes. They were getting a fire ready and I sat on a nearby log, bouncing my leg up and down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are you sure about doing this?” Kaiah asked.

&#x200B;

“I don’t want to. I need to.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She pulled something from her pocket. It was a dagger decorated with a net of feathers on the handle and some jewelry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is made of silver and passed down from my family through generations. I don’t know if it’ll hurt it, but anyone who was tasked with luring it had this on them and they escaped it. Maybe it can aid you too.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While I didn’t exactly believe in luck, I needed all the help I could get.  Kaiah extended the knife to me and I took it. Dean and Stella showed up later, net guns in hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know those don’t work on it right?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“They’ll slow it down,” Dean replied.

&#x200B;

“And we haven’t had a chance to take a shot at it,” Stella added.

&#x200B;

“Right, well, it’s almost time.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got up and Dean placed a hand on my shoulder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Be safe.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I nodded to him and heard off. Seeing as how we were in a wooded area, the most likely form it would take was going to be a tree. My senses were on full alert for anything off, a leaf crunching, a twig snapping. Any indicator that it was about to pounce. It was also fairly smart, though so I needed to appear vulnerable so it wouldn’t figure out the plan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was difficult, but I managed to force myself to relax. The moment my shoulders snapped, there was a movement behind me like someone walking through a pile of leaves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not yet,” I told myself, palms becoming sweaty as it got closer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I estimated the gap between us was reduced enough, I turned around, feigning surprise. This turned into real shock upon seeing its appearance.  It was indeed in the shape of a tree. However, that was only part of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The rest were an amalgamation of different animals and structures, the statue I’d seen it as before with tree roots running through it like worms. Its hands ended in gnarled roots and I could see antlers sticking from its head. Its eyes were filled with that same static. Images suddenly flashed in its eyes of faces. It went through generations of its victims and stopped on one I recognized.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was Brice. This goodman abomination was taunting me. It stared, daring me to make a move. I took a step back. At the same time, it took a step forward.  Everything was completely silent other than the sounds we made.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I saw its knees bend to pounce on me, I booked it, mad dashing back to the reservation with it im bounding pursuit. I wasn’t able to catch up to it when I was the one chasing it. Now that the roles were reversed, I knew I didn’t have long until I was overtaken. It let out a cry like a microphone being held up to a speaker.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was like someone was plunging knives into my ears and it rattled my bones. Luckily, I could see the reservation just up ahead where Kaiah was waiting along with Dean and Stella. I needed to give them a clear shot. When they raised their weapons, I jumped out of the way. Their nets ensnared it, giving us a little time.

&#x200B;

Kaiah gave the order to begin the ritual. The drums and flutes were sounded, and then they started dancing while chanting something in their native tongue. Contrary to the situation, the music they produced was strangely soothing almost akin to a lullaby. Still, it was working, and even through the net, I could see the shapeshifter was being weakened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I pulled out the silver dagger as it tore through the net. It staggered and it attempted to swipe at me. I leaped back, avoiding it. When I did, I noticed the static was covering it once again and it seemed even weaker than before. At that moment, I got an idea of how I may be able to put this thing down for good.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The issue was it required me to do something incredibly risky.  It made another grab at me and this time, I didn’t try to dodge. It lifted me by the shirt and I could hear Dean screaming my name. It let out another screech and reached for my neck. As it did, I was bringing up the dagger. When it made contact with my skin, I felt a shock run through me and my vision became filled with static.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Christ, was this what Brice went through? I’d never felt so much pain before in such a small amount of time. All at once, the sensation disappointed. A coldness was running through me similar to when numbness passes. My vision cleared and I could see the handle of the knife sticking from the shapeshifter’s chest. It convulsed and let go of my neck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I landed hard on my back. The last thing I witnessed before my lights went out was the shapeshifter splitting open down the middle and bright white orbs coming out of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was being shaken awake. Groggily, I opened an eye only half registering I was back in my hotel room. Then my eye fell on who had woken me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Morning, Brice.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My eyes shot open and I sat up.

&#x200B;

“Brice?” I exclaimed. “How are you? Are you alright?”

&#x200B;

“Wow, relax man, I’m good. Everyone brought me up to speed including the whole secret agent thing.”

&#x200B;

“Oh. well, I’m technically an agent in training.”

&#x200B;

“Same difference, you still get laser watches, right?”

&#x200B;

“No?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice snapped his fingers in frustration.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“By the way, do you know what happened after I passed out?”

&#x200B;

“Huh? Oh, yeah.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice told me that  Dean and Stella helped me back into my room. Apparently, I’d been sleeping for over twelve hours straight which given what I’d been through, wasn’t surprising. During my slumber, Sheila went to visit Brice in the hospital again and shrieked when she saw he was awake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I was not ready when she hugged me. Good thing the railing was up or we might’ve tumbled to the floor.”

&#x200B;

“Well, she wouldn’t be Sheila without that kind of energy.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We shared a laugh at that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And that’s why I love her,” Brice said. “Anyway, I  still had to stay overnight for them run some tests, but today I was finally released. Just in time too, Oh shit, I almost forgot. There's going to be another party tonight. Do you feel like going?”

&#x200B;

“Sure, I guess.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice grabbed a bag off the chair and tossed it to me. Inside, was my costume.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m going to change in your bathroom. It might take a while because I need to get the shoulder pads to the right position. Just wait for me outside.”

&#x200B;

“Will do.”

&#x200B;

“Zane?”

&#x200B;

“Thanks, I owe you one.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Don’t mention it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He went to change. I got into my costume and went out into the hall. Stella was coming out of her room back in her Jessica outfit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Stella?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She turned to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, I lost my temper.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She rolled her eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Never apologize when you have a valid reason for feeling a certain way.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She unwrapped a Kit Kat and broke a piece off, extending it to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And anyway,  we’ve all had a lot of reasons for being pissed off lately, so how about we actually have some fun? Dean and Brice’s parents are already waiting  out front.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Later, we were all at our second Halloween party within the next few days.  This one was a bit more exclusive so there were fewer people which was fine by me. Sheila was there as well. I ran into her when I stepped out for some fresh air and she was at the same time. We caught eyes and it felt awkward until out of nowhere, she hugged me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I should mention I’m not a very physically intimate person. I tend to find it awkward unless it’s from certain people she was one of them. She pulled back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, Zane.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was confusing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why are you apologizing? I’m the one who kept things from you.”

&#x200B;

“I know you had a reason to now and I should have realized you were being affected by what happened as much as I was. It was selfish of me to think you weren’t.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I rubbed the back of my head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Look, I wanted to tell you both. Hell, there’s a lot of things I want to talk about but…”

&#x200B;

“It’s complicated?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah.”

&#x200B;

Her lips curled up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, whatever secrets you need to face, we’ll be rooting for you every step of the way.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I returned her expression.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I know.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have to admit. I enjoyed the party a lot. Although Stella did end up overdoing it with the spiked punch, She told us she had a hangover the size of an elephant the next morning. Speaking of parties,  I found out that Kaiah and some of the other Hinono'eiteen were going to be having one this year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After the whole ordeal back then, the lawyer we provided helped her earn a huge settlement for the reservation. I wish I could’ve seen the look on Lester’s face when he was forced to pay out. I don’t think he’s in office anymore, though. Anyway, the festival being held is mostly a traditional thing. However, they did say people could wear costumes if they like.
