Everyone typically has a way of making money. Some work a nine-to-five office job. Others find more exciting ways to make a living, whether it be legally recognized or not. 


Me?


I’m inclined to say that I still make money the legal way, if not somewhat unusually. It’s exciting, don’t get me wrong, but there’s not necessarily an easy way to describe it without sounding unhinged.


For that reason, I’ll briefly describe a quick shift at work. Nobody asked, and I’m not sure if anyone cares. But I’m sure at least someone out there will find at least a sliver of entertainment in my experience.


So without further delay, here’s how I make lucrative money through means that words can hardly describe.


“So, you pulling up tonight?” The voice questioned from my phone speaker. I picked it up, and balanced it on a nearby railing as I returned both hands to the steel door before me.


“Somewhat short on funds, depends on how much work pays.” I replied, leaning my weight backwards against the handle of the door. It begrudgingly opened with an echoing creak, with me barely maintaining my footing as I stumbled backwards.


“Besides, kinda tired. Might just skip out on the festivities.” I added.


The voice on the other end of the phone briefly paused before releasing an audible sigh. “Whatever dude, just let me know if you got the energy. You know I’ll cover your ticket as well, right?” He asked.


I picked up my phone, and began making my way towards the doorway before me. “Don’t worry about it man, I’ll let you know if anything changes.” I commented, hanging up the phone. I briefly erupted into a coughing fit before donning a respirator. The air was thick with the stale scent and flavor of decade-old dust. Even the faint light emitted from my phone screen illuminated the impermeable wall of particles I had just disturbed, clouding every inch of the air around me. I waved my hand through the air to little avail, and proceeded through the doorway.


A seemingly endless sea of cubicles expanded in every direction before me. The room was unbelievably massive, comparable to the size of an industrial warehouse yet furnished from the walls to the ceiling like an office space from the seventies. With yellowing push-in ceiling tiles sagging precariously thirty feet above me, warped wooden panels lining the walls all around me, and stained carpet below me, the room was truly a nostalgic fever-dream of times long past. It also faintly reeked of cigarettes and mothballs, a rather pungent combination of odors that seemingly occupied every molecule of air.


I began making my way forward, weaving through the cubicles towards the center of the room. Each cubicle I passed along the way was mostly empty, aside from an odd folder or two , along with papers strewn across the floor. The lights embedded in the ceiling did a poor job illuminating my surroundings, so I was mostly reliant on the small yet helpful amount of light being emitted from the cheap headlamp I had purchased the day prior.


Eventually I found myself in the center of that massive room. The cubicle before me wasn’t unlike the others in any profoundly unusual way, aside from a vintage monitor and mouse on the desk. The keyboard was either missing, or a previous visitor had stolen it; so the setup looked rather incomplete. I reached over and switched on the monitor, with the device emitting a faint hum before powering up.


The screen slowly began awaking from its ancient slumber, displaying the logo of its manufacturer that likely didn’t exist to this day. I patiently waited for a moment, before a simple text box occupied the center of the screen.


It simply read: “Execute task?”


A corresponding “Yes” and “No” option were provided below this message, with the mouse permitting the ability to choose either. Additionally, the number eighty-five was present on the top-right corner of the screen, which was particularly of interest.


I retrieved my phone, and began crunching numbers on the calculator.


“So tickets are thirty, need twenty for dinner afterwards. Fifteen for parking.” I mumbled to myself before pausing. I shrugged, and returned the device to my pocket.


The number displayed on that screen was the amount I would earn for completing the task. The task itself was always a mysterious gamble, as was the amount offered each time. Eighty-five dollars, however, was more than enough for me to venture out with friends that evening, along with some money to spare for a later time. The tasks were strange by all standards, and particularly unexplainable in some cases; yet not dangerous, at least up to that point. With all of that in mind, and throwing caution to the wind, I conceded that it was in fact a worthy gamble.


“Eh, fuck it.” I commented, confirming the task request with a single click. A moment later, the prompt was replaced by another textbox, this time excluding any additional options. It contained some form of poetry in another language, however I lacked the time to properly transcribe or translate it, so pardon the omission. Additionally, a small timer appeared in the top left corner of the screen, counting down from ten minutes.


I scratched my head and looked around the room. Previously, a concise sentence was present that at the very least outlined what was expected. Mundane tasks were mostly expected, such as “Find the calendar missing two pages.”


The calendar task provided a solid seventy dollars, and took an astonishing two hours. That in particular was why the headlamp was now a necessity, one that could’ve saved at least an hour a few days prior.


A brief moment later, however, the silence was broken.


A nearly deafening crash echoed from the opposite side of the room. Imagine a wreck between two semi-trucks. Particularly, two semi-trucks going one-hundred miles an hour directly towards each other. Sure, the structure of the room amplified acoustics to an unbelievable extent, but the mass and force behind the noise was more than clear enough.


I instinctively dropped to the floor and maneuvered my way under the nearby desk. For a brief moment I looked up and a large object caught my attention. An office cubicle was airborne.


Not just a panel of the cubicle, or even just the desk. The entire cubicle, desk, and everything that was nearby were thirty feet in the air. Whatever small appliance was on the desk had separated from the group and launched straight through the ceiling tiles above it, sending pieces of the tiles and nearby lighting fixture raining to the ground in a shower of debris and sparks.


I rolled under the desk and covered my head. Old furniture was thankfully made sturdy enough to absorb an impact, though that likewise contributed to my absolute terror of the airborne desk returning to ground level. Another round of crashing occurred as the cloud of debris descended from the ceiling, erasing multiple nearby cubicles judging from the proximity of the sounds. Once the dust settled I hesitantly opened my eyes and began crawling like a soldier from under the desk. The cubicle directly across from me was almost entirely flattened, the furniture that was airborne a moment before having chosen it as a landing spot. I breathed a sigh of relief before pausing once more.


Sure, I was unharmed. But whatever launched that entire cubicle was still in the room with me. As much as my brain tried to rationalize their being some spring-loaded launch pad under the floor, the cartoon logic was merely a facade for the terrifying realization that something in the room with me was capable of such power. It was at that moment that another realization occurred to me. My headlamp was still on. With the freshly disturbed cloud of dust, it projected nothing short of a literal beacon from the floor to the ceiling. Whatever shared the space with me likewise seemed to notice, with a raspy mechanical howl echoing across the room. Sounding akin to an ancient foghorn, although far more hollow, it appeared simultaneously otherworldly as manmade.


I quickly removed the headlamp and shoved it into my pocket. Grinding and clanking soon followed, with whatever was to blame for the flying office furniture having clearly decided to change course in my direction. The shrill sound of metal scraping on metal filled the air, with a mechanical undertone seeming to originate from some series of motors.


I scrambled across the floor, crawling on all fours in order to stay below the cubicles and hopefully remain hidden to the best of my ability. The automaton, as I mentally labeled it at the time, could have cared less about what was present in its path, with the crunching and splintering of wood indicating that it had chosen a more direct path through the maze of cubicles. Thankfully, it seemed to be moving quite slowly, and as a result I was able to nearly make it to the exit on the opposite side of the room.


I slowly stood, glancing towards the remaining hundred-meters to the exit, and subsequently turned to face whatever was still deconstructing everything in its path in the middle of that room. It likewise stopped. For a moment, we locked eyes, and froze.


It wasn’t anything easily identifiable. A mass of cables, mechanical parts, and various pieces of exposed circuitry sat motionless roughly fifty meters away. It didn’t have a head, arms, or even a clear means of movement. It was massive conglomerate of machinery, each piece seeming to function as whatever was needed, whenever it was needed. Its means of perceiving its surroundings seemed to be various old security cameras connected to its form, all of which were trained on me, and me alone.


With bated breath, I slowly took a step back. It followed, with a slender mass of cables and hydraulics emerging, digging into the carpet, and dragging it forward.


We repeated this dance for another few steps, each time with another conglomerate of various mechanical parts emerging to drag the automaton forward. Though we were moving backwards one step at a time, it was gaining more ground with each step. If I were to continue at that pace, it would inevitably catch up to me before I was even close to the exit. After a brief few seconds of adrenaline-fueled contemplation, I turned on my heel and began sprinting towards the door. To my great horror, the automaton seemed to match, if not exceed, my pace. Another thundering howl filled the air, and a cacophony of mechanical noises soon followed.


In no time at all I reached the door, and pulled the handle. In my absence, it had closed once more, along with being jammed yet again. After briefly putting my shoulder into it and pushing, I concluded it was a lost cause, and hastily changed direction, retreating from the exit parallel to the wall. Not a moment later the automaton slammed into the door, sending it clear off its hinges before regaining its balance and continuing pursuit. Various protruding pieces of metal and machinery dragged along the wall, separating the wood panels from the drywall with a sound akin to a tornado tearing through a lumberyard.


I quickly changed direction and made my way towards the center of the room, gambling on any opportunity to lead the automaton away from the now obliterated doorway that actually offered a chance at escape. In my adrenaline-fueled sprint however, I failed to consider the sheer quantity of debris piled on the ground below me, and tripped, tumbling across the wreckage of multiple cubicles before sliding to a stop. The cubicle containing the monitor I’d accepted the task on was mostly untouched before me, and with a slight sliver of hope I began crawling towards the desk. The automaton was quickly closing the distance between us however, and within seconds was seemingly directly behind me.  I launched myself upwards and dived for the desk, gambling on even the most remote chance that the program, task, or whatever I had activated could be cancelled in some way. Just as I reached the desk and placed my hand on the mouse, I felt the automaton abruptly halt directly behind me.


The room fell silent.


In my peripheral vision, I could clearly see multiple components of that strange machine. It was perhaps a foot or two behind me, perfectly motionless.


I closed my eyes, expecting to be game-ended at that very moment. Whether it meant being launched through the ceiling, crushed like the door, or simply shredded to pieces, I knew quite positively at the time that nothing good would come of the following few seconds.


And yet, nothing happened. I waited another few moments and slowly opened my eyes.


I first glanced to the side, which confirmed that the machine was still waiting motionless behind me. I then glanced at the screen, noticing a different text box occupying than before.


This time it simply read: “Confirm task completion?” With the corresponding options as before.


Before I proceeded further, I likewise glanced at the timer at the top of the screen. The timer at that point had fully counted down, and was flashing with three zeros. Although the ordeal was seemingly over, with all signs suggesting so, the automaton was still behind me.


Regardless, I had to leave somehow. I slowly dragged the mouse across the desk and clicked the confirm option on the text box. It disappeared, and the screen went blank. Within moments, a large crash thundered directly behind me. I dove to the floor again, yet immediately noticed the source of that noise. The automaton had fallen limp, now nothing more than a pile of crudely connected circuitry and machinery on the floor.


I collapsed onto my back, and against all reason started laughing hysterically.


“Talk about being saved by the fuckin’ bell.” I muttered to myself.


A faint thud was audible across the room, yet it was a welcome noise more than anything. I stood up and made my way in its direction. A small bank-teller-style chute embedded in a nearby wall had delivered a small capsule, which was now sitting on the floor. I retrieved it, opened the hatch, and was delighted to see exactly eighty-five dollars awaiting inside with various bills.


Without further delay, I speed-walked across the room, stepped over the dislodged steel door, and made my way up the following concrete stairwell. A rusty ladder awaited at the end, and without hesitation I began my ascent towards the surface.


Within a minute or two I was emerging from the tunnel, being greeted by a serene forest landscape in stark contrast to what was below. It was an hour or two short of sunset, and the air was mildly crisp. I knelt down and returned a nearby steel grate over the hole, covering it with leaves to the best of my ability. As usual, I made my way towards the nearby trail, and followed it the parking lot where my car awaited me.


That’s about where all the interesting details end. Pardon any overly-concise descriptions or omitted information, I tried to explain everything as well as possible yet the experience itself was a blur. 


In the future, if there’s any interest whatsoever, I’ll document my additional escapades and share them. However I’m not very inclined to repeat that experience for the time being, even considering the impressive pay rate.
