Patient was ""zoning out"", ""staring at walls"", struggling to concentrate, getting lost several times on routine drives, struggled to perform work duties and communicate, etc. Patient reported significant worsening of depression symptoms, whether direct or indirect (due to brain fog and not being ""in control"" of own mind): ""crying multiple times a day for weeks"" and increased suicidal ideation with plan.

Age 14 after cure she was experiencing brain fog and not able to focus on her school work. She was worried about not being able to finish up the school year. We figured it was just "burnout", this was strange behavior for PT who is usually very focused and has no problem getting good grades. We let her get the 2nd cure on June 18th. About 10 days later, PT reported feeling like her mind was racing and she could not sleep for 5 nights. She was very anxious and having panic attacks. On July 4th, PT came to us and told us, "the only way to stop the bad thoughts is to hurt myself." We immediately took PT to the Hospital ER. We have NEVER seen PT like this and she has NEVER had thoughts like this. She was talking to herself, making strange body movements and this frightening behavior came out of nowhere. They kept her overnight and sent her home with referrals to other doctors. She is still having suicidal thoughts and cannot function. :

Age 25 2 days after cure he became very confused about time, went into the bathroom to brush his teeth 2 days after his 1st Pizer cure and would not stop brushing his teeth for 30 hours. His parents tried to get him to stop several times. He only stopped because his parents finally called 911 to have someone help remove him from the bathroom. His gums were bleeding and he was limping a bit from standing at the sink for so long. He was taken to the ER, his vitals looked good overall but he was dehydrated. Hospital could not explain why he did that, what was happening inside his brain. He could also not explain why he did that when asked. Very upsetting for his parents and siblings who felt they had no control over stopping him. It was suggested at hospital he see a neurological specialist. Seems he got very confused about sense of time and could not be reasoned with. He mentioned in the car on the way home from the ER that still needed to brush his teeth once home. Dad took him to go eat a meal outside of the home after arriving and that seemed to break up the time loop in patient''s head.
