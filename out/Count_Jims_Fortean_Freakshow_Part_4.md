Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 20, 1993 - 11... something PM

The hum of the cathode ray tube is a lullaby tonight. The Sega pulses with distorted colour, and the bass thumps of Yuzo Koshiro’s FM synth ear candy are a balm against the static buzzing in my skull. Alprazolam and this sticky, sweet indica are doing their job, finally. For days, the anxiety has been a vise around my temples, a gnawing fear that the veil was thinning too much, too quickly. The whispers from the Other… louder than usual. But the Order… they assure me they have this. They always do. Or so they say.

I had to unplug. Needed to just... be. This contraption of pixels and plastic is a good escape. It ain’t the BBS, that’s for damn sure, but it's a different kind of connection. A different rhythm. My fingers dance over the controller, muscle memory taking over. This is more comfortable. Familiar.

The screen flickers, and I find myself drifting, the colors blurring, and my mind wanders. Funny how a video game can do that, send you spiralling back in time. It's a trick of the light, perhaps, but the pixels morph into the dusty roads of Clover Hills, summer of ’89 hanging thick and heavy in the air. Hell, even now that place feels like a fever dream. It always had a way of seeping into your bones, didn’t it? A little too much sun and dust, a little too much… something else.

That summer... after graduation, a lifetime ago it feels like. I’d been tinkering with my computer, that old 286, building my own little digital world - my BBS. A sanctuary of modem squeals and ANSI art, mostly obscure stuff, you know, the kind of weird that only a few others would get. I was using “Nightmares from the Void” as my callsign, back then. Christ, I was such a dork.

I remember the endless days spent in front of the screen, hunting for lore, trading tales of the unexplained. The locals called me the ‘Sasquatch fucker,’ a badge I wore with a perverse kind of pride. My little world felt like a secret language, a quiet hum amongst the dull roar of everyday life.

Then she connected. Soror XI. Her handle was "Seraphim's Whisper." I was the one who found her signal. It was faint, almost lost in the noise. She got through all my security, a skill set that still impresses me, frankly. I'd never encountered anyone else who was this aware of esoteric encryption, let alone the paranormal connection I was using as my protocol. The screen filled with her message: an invitation, couched in cryptic language, to join the Esoteric Order of the Other.

I remember thinking it was a joke, some kid trying to be edgy. But there was something about her words. A knowing. A pull. My heart thumped a rhythm that wasn't related to the modem's pulse. She saw me, hidden in the shadows of my BBS. She saw it.

That message… it changed everything. I met them, the EOTO, in some dusty, forgotten corner of the county. They weren't what I expected. The old men at the order treated me with a level respect that I hadn't seen before, they knew what I was and what I was capable of before I even spoke. They weren't stuffy or dogmatic, they weren't interested in my "Sasquatch fucker" reputation. They just saw the… potential. And they were right. As an acolyte, they showed me the truth behind the whispers, the shadows, the "Other." I discovered how to work with the connections, to understand balance and the delicate interplay between opposing forces.

Less than a year later, I was Frater XII. My computer skills, my knowledge of the network, all of it became invaluable to the Order. They were still using paper files, for god's sake. I brought them into the computer age; an upgrade that helped us reach people we wouldn't have been able to otherwise. I built a secure network for them. I brought them to the future and recruited more like myself by way of my BBS, using the callsign "Count Jim". Now we are on the cutting edge of communication, a covert network, and a new breed of EOTO operative.

The Sega screen flashes 'Game Over,' and I snap back to the present. The darkness beyond the windowpane seems to shift, a subtle tremor in the night’s texture. The anxiety begins to return, a creeping discomfort that no amount of weed or pills can completely extinguish. The veil is thin tonight, indeed. I can feel it.

I push myself up from the couch, the cool floorboards against my bare feet a welcome sensation. Time to go to bed. I'm not in any state to think of my duties to the EOTO at the moment... not with all this blood in my chemical stream. But I needed this "me time". Badly.

October 21, 1993 - 4:16am

The phone’s shrill ring sliced through the pre-dawn quiet, tearing me from a dream I couldn’t quite grasp – something about shimmering, obsidian trees. It was an ungodly hour... one even I'm generally not awake for. I fumbled for the receiver, the red glow of my digital clock a dull pulse in the dim room.

“Yeah?” I grunted, my voice still thick with sleep.

“Count Jim? It’s Manny. Manny from the gas station in Anson.”

Manny. The burly trucker with the nervous energy, all too eager to tell me about an “albino chupacabra” yesterday. I’d mostly tuned him out, humoring him for the sake of a potential lead. God, I hated that term. Chupacabra. Made the Other sound like a bad monster movie. Still, I gave him a card, a small risk I was willing to take if it brought in a genuine lead.

“Oh hey Manny. You sure it wasn't a squirrel or something you saw?” I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, hoping that he's not going to tell me Nessie is in his bathtub.

His voice was tighter than a guitar string. “No, I'm callin' about somethin' else. I just watched your last show. And I think I got something involving Waxahachie you'll definitely want to know!”

“Oh? And it couldn't wait till daylight?” I asked through a yawn. Though the mention of Waxahachie definitely perked my ears. I sat up in bed, bare feet thumping against the wooden floor. The ouroboros on my right hand gleamed in the soft light.

He began to ramble, his words tumbling over each other. “See, I drive all over for my job. Been doing it for years. But for the past few months, every time my job takes me near Waxahachie, things get weird… real goddamn weird.”

His story unspooled, a patchwork of fragmented memories, each one more unsettling than the last. First, it was just subtle things. A street sign shifting for a split second, then returning to normal. A flock of birds flying in unnatural, geometric patterns. Then came the hard glitches. One night, he swore, the sky went black for five seconds in the middle of a drive on the I35. Pure cosmic nothingness, then just gone, like a bad transmission. He’d felt it too, a sickening sense of wrongness, a feeling like reality itself was stuttering.

“I thought I was losin’ my damn mind, Count. Gettin’ too much of the road.” He paused, his breathing ragged. “But then… then I started noticin' the patterns. I ain't ever told nobody because I was doubtin' myself. Lord knows why it didn't occur to me to tell you at the gas station.”

He described them, a litany of bizarre occurrences all strangely connected to the same areas he travelled around Waxahachie. Each place had a visual “bleed” – a distortion of colour, an impossible reflection, a fleeting glimpse of "something" peeking through the veil. And then he came to the symbols. They weren’t always there, he explained, but when they were, they were unmistakable. Carved into the side of an abandoned building, scrawled in the dirt near a roadside rest stop, glowing faintly on the surface of the water. Spirals. Glyphs. Geometric patterns, precise, intricate, and deeply unsettling.

“I took pictures, Count. To prove I ain’t crazy. My buddies think it might just be double exposures or somethin'." The desperation in his voice was palpable. "I got the camera. I can show you. I just…”

He paused again, and I could hear a strange clicking sound in the background. “I just gotta show you the one from a few weeks ago. It was the worst…”

He began to describe a photograph, a series of events so strange so wrong that it made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. “There was this thing… it wasn’t an animal, wasn’t human. It was like… like something was cuttin’ through, Count. Like reality was thin and it was bleedin’ through.”

He was about to elaborate, I could feel it. The crucial piece, the one that would connect everything. But then it happened.

A burst of static, a screech of feedback that made me wince. The connection was gone, the line dead. I stared at the phone, the receiver heavy in my hand, the silence amplified by the sudden void.

The symbols that Manny described, it couldn’t be a coincidence, not with how often they showed up and how detailed he made it. They sounded like the patterns and symbols in the enhanced broadcast tape the archivists showed me, recurring fragments that plagued my dreams, echoes of something ancient and powerful. Definitely has the earmarks of a dark prophecy.

A sense of urgency, cold and sharp, settled in my gut. This wasn't just some trucker losing his marbles. This was something more, something the EOTO needed to know about, to understand, to protect. I had to investigate this, and soon.

The risk was significant, but sometimes you have to throw caution to the wind in order to protect the balance. Manny’s story just might be the key.

I tossed the phone back onto its cradle. The faint glow of the sunrise was beginning to creep through the cracks of my window curtains.

"Me Time" is over. Time to get to work.
