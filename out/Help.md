Okay so, here’s my story. I don’t know what to do but I also don’t have anyone I can speak to about it either. 

Prior to the house I live in now, we had weird things happen around the apartment such as lights flickering, tvs turning on and off, computers starting up… but we just chalked it up to having electrical issues so we weren’t freaked out (although whenever something would happen, it happened in 3’s). Fast forward to now, we moved in our new house 2 months ago. One of the reasons we thought moving would be nice is because all this weird stuff would stop. No. It’s worse. 

First night my daughter went to her friends for a sleep over, it was just my husband and I home. It was midnight and while we were talking in bed, we heard knocking at our front door. We moved to a completely different town and know only 2 people here… but no one was at the door. I thought it was weird and my husband just thought it was kids messing around. We came back upstairs and not much longer after we heard a utensil fall on the ground. I knew something is going on. Again, my husband made an excuse for it. 

About a month later while I was in my husbands gaming room with him, I heard my baby cry in the bassinet in our room. I went to check and she was out cold, as soon as I walked out the room I heard a bang and went back. I saw that the blinds fell in my room… I didn’t touch them, I just walked out and figured I’d tell my husband to put them back up. When I got to the gaming room I told him and he said “that’s weird” and we hear another bang. I look at him and started crying because I knew I was too scared to check and something was definitely happening in our house that was unexplainable. We checked every room and when we check ours, the blinds were moved across the room and placed on top of my baby in her bassinet. I lost my shit. I started crying and freaking out, I now feel threatened at this point. Both my husband and I thought someone was in our house and of course, we found no one. We also couldn’t excuse what the fuck we just saw so now we believe something is following us. 

We made the worst decision and bought an ouija board and was going to ask whatever is here to leave us alone. Nothing worked, of course the stupid planchette didn’t move and here we are thinking we are crazy. We put the board away in the cold storage and didn’t care to use it again. The next day my husband went in the cold storage to grab water and the light was on, and the board was across the room. He figured the kids moved it and we just ignore it. A week later we got water again…. Board was moved on the other side of the room and flipped upside down, except this time… the kids are at my parents for the week.
