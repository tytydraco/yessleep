Help.

So, I have a cursed necklace. No for real, this is a good community to possibly find some info, but my necklace requires blood for luck. If I do not give it the sacrifice it wants, it takes what it wants by chance.

 Maybe I should describe the necklace. It's a black pearl necklace, tied with hair. Some of the pearls have been replaced with fakes, but I have had most of them verified as genuine black pearls by a jeweler. The hair fact I found out there as well.

 The first time I thought it was cursed was when I wore it, and that day someone tried to fight me, I wound up talking my way out of it, but when I got on the bus I was waiting on I noticed the necklace was nearly burning hot. This was in the middle of winter, and while Arizona may not get that cold, it was still 55 degrees Fahrenheit, not enough for the necklace to be as hot as a sauna stone.

Well the second time it tried to warn me, I had found out what it feeds on, and that's self sacrifice. I had fed it the blood it wanted, and had been having amazing luck. I got a girls number, I got 3 free disposable vapes because of a delivery fluke at the smoke shop I buy them from, and I even had gotten an offer to have my cats fixed FOR ME. All in three days after feeding it. 

On the fourth day though, I wound up cutting my hand really bad while cleaning a refrigerator out, yeah, stupid. Well I had gone to the bathroom, I got blood everywhere cause it was a clean enough cut I didn't notice until it was dripping down my hand. When I took off the necklace to shower that night, I saw I had caked some of the pearls in blood somehow.

I left the necklace sitting on my sink side for a couple days after that. I figured it was coincidence I was wearing it at the time. Then came the third time it was not happy with my sacrifice. I had fed it, at the cost of my own blood, and been wearing it for 3 days. I had good luck again, I got a dog for free, I got a buy one get one deal just in time to afford the one, and it was a one day sale (on weed from the dispensary lol) and I was having some decent luck training the dog I just got, although that might be attributed to the dog himself. 

Well, come day four again, and I was hammering in a post at my house. Long story short, and to spare the horrible details, I smashed my middle finger on my right hand so bad it needed to be amputated. And just before the emergency surgery I remember taking the necklace off with help from a nurse. I remember that it was burning hot again, hot enough the nurse even commented about it briefly. I have not worn the necklace since, and that was 3 and a half months ago.

However, that's not why I need help. I can feel the necklace calling to me from it's box I keep it in. I can feel it's hunger every time I make eye contact with the box. I've woken up twice in the last month with it on, and no memory of putting it on myself. I can't stop thinking of hungry it is, how it craves more of my life's literal blood. When I touch it, I wind up blacking out for a moment, and when I come to I'm either holding it and staring, or it's lying next to me, touching my skin somehow.

 I've tried getting rid of it, and when I have it winds up back in my possession. I threw it in a dumpster, box and all. Next morning my feet had cuts and scrapes and the box was open on my nightstand. Necklace dangling from the open corners like a designer catalogue photo. I had to get antibiotics for my feet, cause apparently I jumped into the dumpster bare foot, and asleep.

Please, anyone with a little knowledge on cursed objects, or how to contain, destroy, or cure them, please let me know what I can do. I can't stand this anymore, it's driving me crazy feeling like I'm losing my mind, but I'm even more scared of what the necklace will make me do in those blackouts.
