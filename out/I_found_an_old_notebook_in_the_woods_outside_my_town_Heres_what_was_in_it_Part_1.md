*This is my confession. Publish it if you find it.*

The school sat at the foothills north of our town, at the end of a single road that swayed lazily past miles of farmland. A pair of tall wrought iron gates on each side of it linked an old trail that curved into a seemingly endless forest, creating a twenty mile loop around the buildings. These woods had been off limits to us during our childhood. It was a dangerous place according to most adults, where a lot of people had gone missing over the years. That hadn’t stopped us. If anything, it had encouraged us to explore and map out everything that we could inside of that circle known as The Loop Trail.

Ben had been the first to suggest cutting through the school fence so we could sneak out during breaks. I’d supplied the wire cutters, borrowed from my dad’s hardware store, and Mitch had done the scouting. He’d found the perfect spot for us, an opening between a couple of pine trees where we’d spent an entire recess taking turns cutting a hole we could all fit through. We’d been twelve at the time.

From our little hole in the fence, a six mile beeline hike straight north led to what we’d called The Hobo Cave, one of the few spots we’d ever had the courage to map outside The Loop Trail. The cave was a giant crack that I’d found between two massive, house sized boulders that stood next to each other and were just barely visible from the Loop Trail. If you were to squeeze into the formation you’d find yourself inside the larger boulder which was somehow both hollow and big enough to comfortably fit at least three people in sleeping bags. I hadn’t been back in years and wasn’t really planning to, at least not until Mitch mentioned it again one day.

I think that anyone would have been surprised to hear that Mitch was the one that called me about doing something to take Ben’s mind off his divorce. Not because Ben was particularly hard to please or anything, honestly giving him a couple of beers and some whiskey would have probably done the trick, but really because Mitch had a tendency to come off as a massive asshole.

“I found a totally new trail that’s never been there before,” he’d told my over the phone.

“What were you doing back at school?” I’d asked.

“The fuck does it matter? They tore down the library and put in a decked out computer lab. I was curious.”

“Okay.”

“Not the point. Next to The Hobo Cave going north. You remember we always thought those woods kept going forever, right?”

“Yeah, I mean before Google Maps, we could just look it up.”

“What? No! Let’s take that fucker camping again!”

I had paused, thinking about the times we’d spent behind the school so many years ago mapping out as much of the place as we could, hiding weed in tree trunks, drinking beers together after class, trying to convince the girls we would take back there that the place was somehow romantic. It’d be good to go back, to rekindle that old thirst for exploration, something I hadn’t felt in years. The place was the core of so many happy childhood and adolescence memories, and yet I hadn’t been back in years, hadn’t been back since the nightmare.

I didn’t even really know if it was actually a nightmare or not. I’d spent the night alone in The Hobo Cave just a few days before graduation, trying to hide from my parents. The weight of their expectations for me, the fact that I had nearly failed every single one of my classes, that I hadn’t managed to get into any schools, had hit a breaking point in what little was left of our relationship. It’d been a freezing night for June, the kind of cold that sneaks into your bones and chills you from the inside out. I’d been wrapped up in a sleeping bag I always kept there, lying alone in the pitch black nothingness of the cave, when it happened.

The first thing I remember was noticing the smell, how my nostrils had dilated in recognition. Was someone outside smoking weed, I’d thought. Maybe a skunk was passing through. But the smell had grown stronger and that same musky hint had turned to sour milk, the kind that makes you involuntarily turn away, thousands of years of evolution instinctually pushing you to get away from what you know is rot, what you know is death. I’d felt myself about to puke. That’s when I’d realized I wasn’t alone in there.

I don’t know how I’d known, because it didn’t make any noise, but I’d known I wasn’t alone. I remember holding my breath, I remember staying completely still, lying in the fetal position and hoping to God that whatever was in there with me wouldn’t notice me, that it would just go away and leave me alone. Then I’d felt its breath in my ear as something had whispered from behind me, a low sort of guttural growl whose moisture clung to the hairs on the back of my neck.

I’d screamed, had reached for the flashlight I’d always kept on the ground next to me was on the other side of the cave in seconds, my back hugging the rock as I’d turned on the light to reveal a completely empty space. Absolutely nothing, a nightmare Mitch had said once I’d told him and Ben. But that feeling of paranoia, of constantly having something in my peripherals in the darkness, just outside of my vision, had never really gone away. I’d never really figured out what it had whispered, but its tone had been somehow beckoning, like it had wanted me there, like it had wanted me to follow.

“What do you mean by new?” I’d asked Mitch over the phone.

“Like, you know, *new*. It wasn’t there and now it is. You fucking stupid or what?”

“Someone just built a random trail?”

“I guess? Who even builds trails anyway, right? Shit we never thought about doing that and we had that fucker nailed down tight.”

“Ben did say he’d always been bummed we’d never left the loop.”

“Exactly. Nostalgia and shit. It’ll be good for him, so let’s fucking go.”
