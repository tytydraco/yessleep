Hi, I won't be saying my name. The previous writer, Elliot, was able to keep my identity safe and I will follow that. Call me Alice, please.

They will try to track me, but they'll never be able to, and the managers, whoever they truly even are, will not know me, nor where I am.

Unfortunately, I can let you know what happened to Elijah. It's similar to what they did to his friend, Elliot if I'm thinking correctly. I myself don't know what they do to the fired people. But from what I see they become the people in the black cars and the crew members that try to bring you out from your booth.

There is more rules for each station, some are the same or similar. For example the rule of coins being on the ground is like another rule for the fries. Just don't leave fries on the ground. So many new people can fall victim to that one, I've seen people fumble and forget to pick up their messes, I feel terrible and sorrowful for them all.

But it is time for me to explain my story, or at least my experiences. As I said I'm safe from their tactics, for now, it's a matter of time before my tricks can't fool them for longer.

I won't say anything about myself, that's what they want. I'll be discovered faster if I did. The managers only know I'm a girl.

These weird days don't happen all the time. Only during snowy days. Elijah was lucky not to experience any of these oddities, actually I'd say really lucky ignoring every snowfall day. Elliot knew of these rules way before him, just he messed up with the windows, I always hated that rule.

I'm sorry everyone, I'm getting side tracked on them, I just feel bad for all the victims from this stupid place, I'm sure we all feel bad, the staff here I mean.

Every night I get to work is extremely stressful. The long hours, the 9-5's and so on. I think anyone who has worked fast food or any job actually gets this.

I'll talk about today for you all. I had two duties for my shift. One half being BDAP, which means Beverages, Desserts, and Production for people who don't know. And of course, what you should know about, Drive-Thru.

I already remember the rule sheet, and like I said, I'm safe.

I'm putting my alias for everything.

Hello Alice! Welcome to BDAP! This station isn't hard or difficult, but we expect you to follow all the rules please! The Management team expects the best from you.

Rule 1: Pay attention to the time! Strangely enough, the clock seems to stop or just seem off sometimes, please immediately call a MANAGER over to fix this issue. If you don't have this issue fixed within TEN MINUTES of this problem occurringâ€¦ Strange things will happen, and you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 2: Never leave any Coffee cups unattended for too long. Some certain person, Geoff, likes to mess with these if they are left out, especially if someone has ordered something. A reminder that Geoff only appears after mistakes from CREW MEMBERS, but hey, better safe than sorry. Also, refer to rule 5 to learn how to deal with Geoff. If you leave a coffee cup out and Geoff messes with it you will be immediately FIRED. 

Rule 3: If a certain order appears, make sure you hand it out to the customer. It's a very special person, his name is Scott and he is a regular. Don't be scared as Scott is kind. He orders a Coffee with Fudge, 4 cream, 3 sugar, and caramel. This will be easy to spot, but Scott loves it when the maker hands it out so make sure to do that. If you don't make his drink or don't hand it out, you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 4: When making specific 5 ice creams, always add a little bit of caramel on the top, those specific guests love it and will pay a tip, and we love money. However if you don't, a MANAGER will be SCOLDED and these guests will be mad. If you don't add any of the pumps you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 5: Please look out for Geoff. Geoff doesn't work here, sometimes he stops by after a CREW MEMBER makes a mistake with a specific rule. Please inform a MANAGER if you spot him. He has orange hair, freckles, glasses, and lots of ring jewellery, specifically silver and gold. If you spot Geoff but don't call it in you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 6: Sundaes are great, when making them between 5 to 6, and only that time, layer the pumps. One pump for the bottom, one pump for the middle, one pump for the top. The quality doesn't matter, the guests like it this way. If you don't pump it correctly you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 7: You work your station alone, never let a second person make your drinks or desserts, they are trying to mess with your customers. If someone makes anything that you're supposed to make, you will be immediately fired.

Rule 8: Lastly, never tell friends, family, or anyone about this list. If you do, you'll be immediately FIRED.

We wish you luck Alice! If you'd like more hours just call a MANAGER and ask for them. We are working past closing hours tonight. Thank you for your great effort and amazing work!

And that's all the rules, I'm currently in the break room as I type this so it took a lot of that break time to actually write all that.

But basically, all the capitalised words you see like FIRED obviously mean something else. The managers are not real people, fired, well, I guess you become one of them, and crew members actually do refer to us. Scolded does mean something else maybe, actually I'm yet to see a manager get scolded.

I start my shift soon, I can update you all after my shift. I promise I will keep in touch with you all.

I promise.
