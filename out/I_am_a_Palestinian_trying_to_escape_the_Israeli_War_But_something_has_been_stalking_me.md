I have always lived in poverty and discomfort. My family used to have a house, land and enough money to live comfortably, but that was many years ago. That was before Israel bulldozed our homes and forced us into a ghetto. Now we are treated worse than animals, murdered, bombed and tortured at will by the invading army. I know this from personal experience- from the experiences of myself and my family.  
  
My grandmother’s sister had been one of the victims of the Safsaf Massacre back in 1948, when the Israeli Army had gathered up all the people in a small town. They started by taking the young girls and women aside, ripping them out of the arms of their family. When the girls came back crying and pleading for help, their clothes ripped to shreds, the Israelis had only laughed.  
  
That was when they started shooting the townspeople, massacring them and throwing them alive down wells. My grandmother’s sister was one of the girls that was raped and then murdered by the Israeli military in the Safsaf Massacre.  
  
So I know exactly what Israel is capable of, what kind of sick and evil place that festering country truly is. When the bombs started falling in 2023, I knew I needed to get out of Gaza.  
  
The day that it started, I remember my mother running in the house, saying, “Jalel! You must get out of here. The Israelis just bombed the hospital and the school. They are targeting our homes and trying to wipe us out.” I stared at her for a long moment, feeling stunned and dissociated.  
  
“Why would they do that?” I whispered. I had hoped the Israeli war crimes were a thing of the past.  
  
“Because they hate us, that’s why!” she hissed. “They stole everything from us- our homes, our land, our jobs, our economy. But they won’t be happy until they steal our lives, too.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Within days, Israel stopped everything from going into Gaza: food, electricity, medicine, even water. I saw many people die, especially the elderly, the sick and the very young. The constant strikes from Israel on our town shattered homes into piles of crushed rubble. Within months, tens of thousands of innocent people had died.  
  
I stood on the roof, watching as thick clouds of black smoke snaked their way up into the clouds. Jets flew overhead, shaking the ground with sonic booms. I cringed every time one came low, not knowing if it would bomb my home as well. My friend, Wahib, stood by my side.  
  
“Can’t you use your special gift to get us out of here?” I asked Wahib. He didn’t like it when I brought up his ability and his strange, invisible friend. Wahib shook his head, not meeting my eyes.  
  
“I won’t call it up, unless I have to,” he said, looking sad and empty. “It is a dangerous thing, and I don’t know if I can control it for long.”  
  
“Yes, but we’re going to die if we stay here,” I whispered, my heart sinking. He nodded.  
  
“We need to get out of Gaza before the bombs truly start falling,” Wahib responded, shaking his head. “They’re probably going to kill hundreds of thousands of us this time. Just wipe us out like dogs.” He spat, disgusted. “I only hope there’s some justice in this world.”  
  
I didn’t know what to say to that. My grandmother’s sister had never gotten justice, after all, unless she was going to receive it on the Day of Judgment. And yet, as a reward for its war crimes, Israel simply got more funding from the US. No one seemed to care about the piles of bodies they were leaving behind in every Palestinian town.  
  
“What about your family? What about my family?” I asked, the realization hitting me like a ton of bricks. My mother was sick with diabetes, and with Israel cutting off all medication to Gaza, she was rapidly getting worse. Wahib only shook his head.  
  
“We can’t help them,” he said. “We need to help ourselves. We need to get out of this hellhole immediately, before the real genocide begins. They’re going to bomb every house they can.” As if to confirm what he said, a jet flew low overhead, so close I could see the six-pointed star on its gray metal skin, so close I could smell the jet fuel and fumes. Before I could respond, though, something fell out of it in a curving arc. Then it headed straight down, as graceful as an Olympic diver.  
  
“Bomb!” I shrieked, but it was too late. Something blurred through the sky, leaving a dark green trail behind it. Wahib screamed and covered his head, ducking. Absurdly, I almost wanted to laugh when I saw that. As if ducking and covering his head would protect him from a bomb if it landed on our heads.  
  
But the blur landed at the next house over, falling through the air so fast that I didn’t even have time to react. A flash and a sense of blinding heat consumed everything. I felt myself falling. I tried yelling, but I couldn’t hear my own screams over the cacophony of the blast. The smell of smoke and jet fuel and charred wood hung thick in the air like a cloud.  
  
I don’t know how long I lay on the roof like that, just breathing, stunned and shell-shocked. But I came back quickly, blinking my eyes to clear the smoke and dust filling the air. I looked over at my neighbor’s house and saw an inferno of dancing flames. In the center, an enormous eye of fire swirled like a hurricane.  
  
Screams echoed through the street. Then the front door opened and a young girl ran out, her body aflame, her hair lit up like a torch. Her skin blackened and melted as the fire consumed her. I could see drops of liquified fat and sizzling blood dripping off her nose. Her screams seemed to go on forever. Even now, when I close my eyes, I still hear it: the horror, the agony and the terror in that young girl’s voice as she died.  
  
Wahib was suddenly standing over me, his shoulder-length black hair covered in tiny pieces of brick and gray dust. He blinked quickly, his eyes tearing up. He tried to say something, but only succeeded in coughing. Bent over, he retched, spitting up clear water.  
  
I stumbled to my feet, pushing myself slowly up. I felt light-headed and dizzy. The Sun seemed far too bright, the air too hot. I thought I might pass out for a moment, but I steadied myself and focused on my breathing. Wahib straightened and looked me in the eyes.  
  
“We need to leave- today. Right now,” he whispered, sounding as if he had sand in his throat. I couldn’t think of anything to say to that, so I only nodded.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I told my mother I was leaving within a few hours. She didn’t look surprised, but her eyes grew misty.  
  
“Make it out alive,” she said. “If you can make it to the EU, you will find peace and prosperity there. Not like this place.” She motioned out the window to the destroyed cars and piles of rubble littering the streets.  
  
“But what will happen to you?” I asked, feeling sick. The first tears slipped down my cheeks. “Who will take care of you?” She just shook her head.  
  
“Don’t worry about me,” she said. “I can take care of myself. I’ve done so for fifty years already, haven’t I?” I gave her a weak smile as Wahib came in the door, carrying a backpack filled with supplies. I had my own backpack on already. I gave my mother a hug and turned to leave this desolate place behind, telling her I loved her.  
  
I didn’t know it then, but that would be the last time I ever saw my mother.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Wahib and I set out down the road as the Sun faded behind the horizon, sending crimson streaks like drops of fresh blood dancing across the sky.  
  
“I have a friend,” Wahib said, his dark eyes flashing, “but it will take money.”  
  
“I brought everything I have,” I said, which was true. It wasn’t much, a few thousand dollars, but it was my entire life savings. I had worked for years to save that money.  
  
“Well, we can get through to Egypt if we pay the man,” Wahib said. “It’s $2500 per person to get out, though.” My heart seemed to drop as he said this. Wahib just shook his head. “I know, I know, it’s all I have, too. More than I have, really. My mother gave me some of her money before I left, even though she needs it far more than me. I promised I would get a job when I got out of here and send her some of each paycheck, though.” I felt sick, thinking of losing my entire life savings in a single day. But I knew he was right. We needed to get out at any price, and we could hopefully always find higher-paying jobs somewhere else. After all, the Gazan economy was in the toilet.  
  
We walked past apartment buildings with bare bricks exposed to the cool night air. A few one-story stucco houses with courtyards stood around us. A few hundred feet away, one of the houses had been hit by a bomb blast. Half of its roof hung askew, with the rest forming a giant, black crater in the center. Outside, the blackened shell of a moped stretched out across the sidewalk.  
  
I noticed how empty the street was at that moment. It was highly unusual. There were always kids running around and yelling or people outside smoking or sitting. It felt like I had walked into a different world, one where everything had gone deathly silent except for my breathing and my pounding heart.  
  
“Do you… feel something?” I asked Wahib, trying to keep my voice as low as possible. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t want to shatter that silence. Wahib only nodded.  
  
“Maybe we should turn around,” Wahib said, leaning over close to my ear and whispering. A cold spear of dread had sunken into my chest. A freezing wind blew down the desert street, carrying swirling clouds of sand as it passed.  
  
“Where are we meeting this man?” I asked, nervous. I looked down at my hands and saw they were trembling. All the hairs on my body stood on end, as if lightning were about to strike.  
  
“He’s only a kilometer from here,” Wahib said. I gave an exasperated hiss through my teeth. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t feel we would make it a kilometer.  
  
I looked up at the sky, realizing I didn’t see any more Israeli planes, missiles or helicopters anymore. Other than my own heartbeat, everything had gone totally silent and dead.  
  
I heard the slightest rustle of sand behind me, as if a foot had just barely grazed it. I turned my head and saw something that still gives me chills.  
  
Only about ten paces behind us loomed a ten foot tall creature with gray, stone-like skin. It moved like a mannequin, and it truly looked like the thing had been carved from granite. Only its joints were able to twist and bend, with all other parts of its body staying as stiff as a statue.  
  
It had long, narrow arms that ended in sharp fingers, each of them gleaming and as long as garden shears. Its legs were inhumanly long and thin and ended in something almost like webbed feet. It had a single, bloody eye in the center of its face that rolled with insanity, its sclera yellowed and sickly-looking.  
  
It opened an enormous mouth, its jaw ratcheting down as if it had whirring gears built into its head. Inside that unhinged jaw, I saw row after row of baby teeth. Thousands of children’s milk teeth gleamed, six or seven rows growing side by side with each other like tumors. Many of the teeth stuck out at odd angles, and some even had tiny versions of themselves growing out of the sides.  
  
“It’s a Golem,” Wahib hissed as he grabbed my arm and pulled me forward. We started running. I looked back at the gray, nightmarish creature plodding forward. It continued to gnash its twisted, ingrown teeth at the air. “A Golem made from spirit and rock, sent by the enemy.”  
  
“Good thing I saw it,” I said, shuddering at the thought of what might have happened if I hadn’t. The world stayed silent and dead, as if we had entered some shadow world of emptiness, an unpopulated and eerie facsimile of normal reality.  
  
We turned down an alleyway, still trying to find the home of the fixer who would get us into Egypt. I think both of us knew that we weren’t going anywhere, however. I knew he wouldn’t be home, just as no one else was home, just as the once-busy streets had all gone mysteriously empty.  
  
As we got out of the winding, tight alleyway and past the stucco houses, I heard rustling again. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from.  
  
“He’s close,” I whispered to Wahib, who nodded grimly. We went out onto the street. There was no light anymore. The bombings had knocked out electricity. I couldn’t see far, so I didn’t notice as the eldritch abomination attacked us from behind.  
  
I felt like I had been struck by a train. I went flying, smashing into the front door of an apartment building. I felt something in my arm crack and heard the bone snap. Gritting my teeth, I rolled on the ground as the Golem charged me. For such a large, heavy creature made of stone, it moved silently, its granite feet blurring across the sand like a whisper.  
  
Wahib uttered a single word in some language I had never heard before- certainly not Arabic, English or Hebrew. It sounded ancient and guttural, like the word itself was a piece of the heart ripped out and made into sound.  
  
A creature made of smokeless fire appeared in front of the charging Golem. The creature’s black body looked translucent, its limbs twisted and snake-like, its face just a mask of constantly-shifting shadows. In its heart and its eyes, I saw the orange currents of flame whirling and spinning.  
  
“A jinn,” I whispered, amazed. Wahib had claimed he could control “his Jinn”, as he called it, but he was always afraid to bring it out. I had never seen a Jinn, and before this moment, I wasn’t even sure they really existed.  
  
The Golem roared in fury, its deep, inhuman voice thundering across the empty streets. It brought its sharp fingers up in a swiping motion, aiming at the Jinn’s fiery eyes, but the Jinn pulled back. Its right arm stretched out like a boa constrictor, growing thinner and wispier as it wrapped around the Golem’s neck. The Golem’s giant, rolling eye bulged in its socket as its wind was cut off. It threw itself forward, tackling the Jinn to the ground. They started rolling, clawing and biting. Deep gashes appeared in the Golem’s stone skin, and the Jinn’s shadow flesh shot out small, dying blue flames when injured.  
  
“Come on, we have to go,” Wahib whispered. I jumped, not even realizing he had snuck over to me. He wrapped an arm around my shoulders and pulled me up. I groaned softly as I looked down at my mangled, twisted arm. I felt like I had cracked a few ribs as well. Every breath hurt like fire. The sounds of the two creatures fighting followed us far down the empty, labyrinthine streets.  
  
“Did the Golem pull us into this alternate shadow reality, do you think?” I said.  
  
“I think that’s probably how they hunt,” Wahib said simply, his expression grim.  
  
“So we can’t get out until the Golem dies?” He shrugged.  
  
“This has never happened to me before, but I would think if the Golem pulled us in here, then his death should free us,” Wahib said.  
  
“And what if they continue to fight forever, the Jinn and the Golem?” I asked. Wahib just shook his head.  
  
I noticed I still had internet on my phone, however. I decided to write down what happened with one hand. I can’t use my other hand, and my arm is extremely swollen. A piece of the bone is poking out through the skin. I really hope I can find medical attention somehow.  
  
All I know now is that we somehow got trapped in this empty shadow world when the Golem chose us as its victims.  
  
And I don’t know if I’ll ever get out.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
As the night progressed, we kept wandering through the empty, dark streets. Hours and hours passed, but the Sun never seemed to come up. We wandered for days, but couldn’t find any sign of the Jinn or the Golem.  
  
We started going into houses and looking for weapons. One house had automatic rifles, grenades and ammo. Wahib and I both took some.  
  
On the third day, we heard hissing like the sizzling of electricity from far away. We went forward and found the Jinn, half-dead and covered in deep gashes. The fire in his eyes had faded to almost nothing.  
  
“The Golem has won,” it said, pointing down the road. There, I saw it standing, one arm ripped off but its eyes triumphant. It rushed at us, and Wahib and I opened fire.  
  
It came like a runaway train pounding the street and smashed into Wahib, clawing him with its one remaining hand. He died, but as he died, he pulled the pin on a grenade.  
  
A fiery explosion rocked the street as the Golem disappeared in the blast. With a popping sound, the world came back, the streets filled with scared and starving people.  
  
I was home.
