A cat whiter than snow balanced itself on the barbed wire. A trapeze artist in his own right. He saw me, approached. His eyes were a color I couldn’t even begin to understand. Solid blood red balls, he almost had eyeshadow on. Thin snow white fur with charcoal black skin peering through. He mawed and purred as he rubbed his back across my shins. 

As I leaned over to pet him he sunk his back to avoid my hand and darted a few feet away. I walked after him. Then, he did it again and again. He kept doing this until he reached the edge of my property. He slinked under the fence next to a pole. Something deep, deep down told me to follow. 

There was a second voice screeching somewhere in the back of my mind, pleading that I don’t fall for this. I did not listen. I had to squeeze under the wire. It caught the bottom of my shirt and kept a chunk of cloth. 

I paid no mind, I stood up. He was waiting for me. Deathly silent, not even the wind in these dark and dank woods. I could smell the pond a few hundred feet behind me. The odor of a fire was faint. My face squeezed as I noticed it. I looked down and saw the cat again. He looked like he was grinning at me. He turned and looked north. Turning back to me he looked me in the eyes. He didn’t have pupils, or an iris. 

Yet he gazed into my soul. He was grinning no longer. His face was saying to me “Come on, I know the way let’s go we haven’t got all night.” I listened to his silent speech and we traveled north. The scent of burning got stronger. The glowing orange of a fire decorated the tops of trees before I could actually see it. The smell of carbon got stronger as more and more golden orange light poured through the branches. I crested a hill as I realized two things. The cat was gone. Had been for a while and the fire I was smelling must be enormous. 

The smoke weighed on the air. The smog was making shapes of men. As the light danced I finally laid eyes upon it. A tent of wood with a pile of bushings engulfed in the middle. Six women cloaked in canvas bags kept their feet in place while moving their arms in a choreographed wave. As one would raise their right hand the one on their right would raise their left. They had some space between them. Their mouths were moving but I couldn’t hear them. They all stopped in unison. Their arms straight out from their bodies. 

All noise returned to me the wind, the crackling of flames, and the distant rumble of trucks across the highway. Their heads slowly turned towards me. The three on the west and the three on the east. Bunched together and joined hands. All six marched towards me and created a hallway with their arms. Joining their hands together to make the roof. Their bodies, the walls. They stared at me, a dull humming rose from them. It took a second but when they synced onto the same note the voice in the back of my head was screaming. *Roaring* at me “FIGHT! Fight it, you can beat this. You have to fight, your life is at stake!” 

I started shaking violently, convulsing. My muscles were unwillingly being twisted to put me on my hands and knees. I started seizing while blood started pooling in my eyes, spewing from my mouth and nose. A hand was on each of my limbs ripping my arms forward. Dragging me towards the fire. The voice in the back of my head still sounded like it was miles away. I was gagging on the blood in my mouth. As my left hand lay upon the glowing coals, what was left of burning branches, I felt no pain. The voice in my head gave way to their humming. I laid my head in the center of the fire pit and their humming stopped. They started cackling. I had the physical ability to move but I could not. Those hands were resting on my back, holding my head in the flames. I thrashed and thrashed and all I did was pitch flaming chunks of wood.
