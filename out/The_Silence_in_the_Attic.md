There’s a rule in my family we never break: we don’t talk about the attic. We don’t look at it, don’t mention it, don’t even joke about it. As kids, my brother and I thought it was just part of the house’s old, creaky charm—until he vanished. Now, it feels more like a warning.

My brother, Jake, disappeared when I was eight. It happened on a cold night, after we snuck up to the attic to play hide-and-seek, daring each other to stay in the pitch-black shadows a little longer. But Jake never came back down. The police found no trace of him. No sign he even left the house. The attic door was shut tight, just like it had been every day since.

I convinced myself that he had run away. It was easier to believe than the alternative—that something in that attic had taken him.

Twenty years later, I’m back in the same house, unemployed and sleeping in my childhood bedroom. The house creaks more now, groaning under the weight of time, and every night I hear the faintest whisper of footsteps above me. I tell myself it’s the wind, or the house settling. But I know better. Every time I glance at the attic door, my pulse quickens, and the memory of that night claws at my mind. I’ve avoided the attic ever since Jake disappeared. But recently, something has changed.

The first sign was small. I noticed a worn spot on the attic latch—fresh, shiny, as though it had been used recently. The attic hadn’t been opened in two decades, or so I thought. Then came the noise: a slow, deliberate tapping, like someone was waiting up there, impatient for me to listen.

The weight of guilt I’d buried for years began to stir. If I had followed Jake up that night, if I hadn’t been too scared to go after him... maybe he wouldn’t have been alone. Maybe I could have saved him.

That guilt became unbearable. One night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed a flashlight and climbed the stairs, my heart pounding louder than the creaks underfoot. As I reached the door, memories of Jake’s laughter echoed in my ears, twisted and distorted. I could almost hear him daring me to come in, just like when we were kids.

The attic door opened with a moan, revealing the dusty, cluttered space I had forgotten. My hands trembled as I swept the flashlight beam across the room. And then I saw it—footprints in the dust. Small, familiar. Jake’s. They led to the rocking chair in the corner.

The chair was facing away, gently swaying as if someone had just stood up. My heart skipped a beat. I called out, "Jake?" But only silence answered. I took a step closer. The lullaby began then—soft, fragile, like it was being sung through old walls. It was the same lullaby my mother had sung to both of us when we were little.

I felt a shiver run down my spine. “Jake?” I whispered again, my voice cracking under the weight of my own guilt. The chair stopped swaying, and the humming faded into nothing.

Suddenly, the flashlight flickered. The room dimmed, and that’s when I saw it—something moved in the shadows, something small, hunched. Slowly, it turned toward me, and my blood turned to ice. It was Jake. Or, at least, it looked like him. His eyes were hollow, his skin pale and stretched tight. But it wasn’t my brother anymore. It couldn’t be.

"Why did you leave me?" The voice was his, but warped, brittle. His body trembled, and he looked at me with a mix of anger and sorrow. "You promised you wouldn’t leave."

I stumbled back, my chest tightening with panic. "I—I'm sorry. I didn't know... I didn’t mean to—"

His expression shifted to a twisted smile. "You’ve been hearing me, haven’t you? Every night, waiting for you to come back up here. You ignored me."

Tears welled in my eyes as I backed toward the door. The guilt I had buried for two decades now suffocated me, and I could hardly breathe. My brother—this thing—he had been waiting all these years. And I had left him alone, forgotten.

Suddenly, I felt a cold grip on my shoulder, a touch too familiar, but it wasn't Jake’s. I turned, and no one was there. Just the suffocating air, pressing down on me. The rocking chair started again, gently creaking back and forth. Jake’s shadow stood still, staring, waiting.

“You shouldn’t be here,” a voice whispered in my ear—soft, yet sinister.

I fled down the stairs, my legs barely holding me. As I slammed the attic door behind me, I could still hear the chair creaking. My chest burned with guilt, and for the first time in years, I couldn’t ignore the attic anymore.

The lullaby still plays, every night, as if calling me back. And deep down, I know Jake is still waiting for me—waiting for me to keep the promise I made to him years ago. But I don’t know if I’ll survive another visit to the attic.
