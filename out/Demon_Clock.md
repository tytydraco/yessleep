First, I'll begin by saying I grew up in a Christian family and I do claim to be Christian myself but in the past few years, I've really lost my way in my relationship with God. Also, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety which I still struggle with to this day. My whole life, my family has moved from house to house, city to city, and back constantly because of my dad's job so I never really had a set-in stone place I call home. My family is my home... If I had to pick a house that felt most like home, it would probably have to be my grandparent's house located somewhere in Montana where I was born and raised. I always have dreams of living in their house but never dream of the house I'm actually living in.

As I said before, my relationship with God and my life, in general, haven't been in the best place. My depression was getting so bad I ended up getting drunk at a party one night and cheated on my girlfriend of two years at the time. It was only a kiss, but she took it pretty hard and ended things with me a week or so after. Rightfully so, but our relationship was going downhill as it was, and I think she wanted an excuse to end things with me anyway. For a long time, I believed I was a bad person or somehow became one, and eventually just accepted my fate. This put me in a downward spiral until I was completely at rock bottom. Things are a lot better now though, and I'm willing to do whatever I need to get back to the old loving self I once was. And thanks to Jesus, I don't believe I'm a bad person anymore, just made a few bad decisions in my life. I am forgiven and you can be too by the way. You are not defined by your mistakes or diagnoses. If you're experiencing any paranormal or demonic attacks like the one, I'm about to share with you or you struggle with any mental illness or suicidal thoughts. Please know those are from the devil and Jesus is the only one who can save you. I'm not here to preach to you though. I'm here to tell you about unexplainable things that have happened in my life.

But before we get into my personal horror story, which by the way is 100% true and I couldn't care less if you believe it or not. I also would like to mention I've been told I'm "Sensitive" regarding things of the spiritual realm, or "otherworldly" things. Also, I'm a fairly sensitive guy in general. I cry watching movies and when other people are feeling a certain way, I can begin to feel the same emotions they do. If I'm not super depressed and lacking empathy anyway. People seem to come to me with their problems regardless, even strangers. I love helping people but I'm not sure exactly what these "gifts" are exactly, and they can be burdensome at times. Lastly, I'm a very light sleeper. Any sound or change in the atmosphere will wake me and I'll wonder what's happening around the house. Only to discover one of my family members sitting quietly on the couch in the family room reading a book.

Okay so enough with the sob story and introductions. Let's get into the stuff you're here for.

Ever since I decided to get back on track and get close to God again, I've been experiencing a variety of paranormal... events the last few weeks; more than usual anyway, and it's never to this intensity.

I started becoming downright terrified of going to sleep at night due to these happenings that would occur, mostly when I'd try to close my eyes.

For example,

On this night, I couldn't fall asleep. Nothing too out of the ordinary as I also deal with occasional insomnia, but this night was different. I felt something was off. I couldn't pinpoint what was going on right away but I knew there was some sort of energy circling my room. After a while, I felt a cold breeze sweep past me, and my arm hairs stood straight up. It was pitch black but even after experiencing that, I didn't feel scared because I experience things like this all the time... but I just wanted to be left alone and I was getting sick of the constant feeling that something was near, lurking in the shadows. I opened my Bible and began to read. I prayed aloud asking Jesus to remove the unholy presence from my house and He did. I know this because after reading and praying, a flash image of a demon-looking creature crouched over outside my window appeared in my mind. It was such a clear picture but quite disturbing, to say the least. It was almost like the demon was sitting there waiting to come back into my room any chance it got. My faith in God was weak so it makes sense to me now why the demon didn't run completely away. If I wasn't scared before I definitely was now after receiving that visual. My guess is the demon was still feeding off my fear. That's my theory anyway. Before this, I'd never had any visions or flash images like this. This moment was only the start of my quest to expel the paranormal from my life.

The info I'm about to give is important for understanding the rest of my story. So, bear with me. I'm super into vintage stuff and I'll often purchase a variety of vintage items from eBay or local thrift stores. Always making sure they are still fully functional just like they originally were. My room (which is located in the basement) is full of things from the '40s through the '60s. My favorite item is this 1940s 8mm projector along with an 8mm film camera sitting next to it that I display on my bookshelf which is of course full of old books going back to the early 1800s. But that's not important. What is important though is the last thing I can remember buying, which is this 6ft tall old man clock I purchased at a thrift shop I was working for at the time. Yes, the type of creepy-looking clocks you might see at your grandmother's house or in a horror flick. I loved this thing and thought it was a great addition to my old-style room. I never had any issues with it until recently though. If my fascination for old things doesn't creep you out already, I'm sure this will:

On a typical cold, late winter night. As usual, I'm having trouble getting to sleep. After hours of trying and failing to shut my mind up. Finally, I feel myself drifting off. Until out of nowhere I'm stuck with an intense feeling of dread. I'm wide awake now. I begin to feel very unsafe and vulnerable to whatever is causing this. To accompany my intense fear, an extremely sad and depressing feeling washes over me, unlike anything I've felt before. I knew these feelings or emotions were not my own. I know what my depression feels like. I was extremely unsettled by this, as I've never felt this feeling of despair at this level. Fearful and confused about the source of this I notice my grandfather clock towering over me to my right. The feeling I got looking at this clock was terrible. Never before have I been so unnerved and disgusted at the sight of my clock. I have full-body chills now, and the hairs on the back of my neck and arms stand high at attention. All of the sudden I get another flash image of something. This time a man's face with a very sad expression. It's hard to describe it but I am willing to attach a picture of something I drew that looks fairly similar to what I saw.

It reminded me of those creepy-looking theatrical emotion masks I'm assuming comedians of some sort would use. Hopefully, that gives you an idea. This was no laughing matter though. After this dreadful feeling and the visual of the man's face to accompany it, I instantly got up and laid the clock down on its side, and threw a blanket over it.

Sleeping was out of the question now. I'm in full fight or flight now. My mind is racing, going through every possibility of what the hell just happened. Thinking: "Am I crazy? Was I possessed before and whatever was in me now resides in the clock?" All I knew was there was something very off about that clock and before getting close to God again I never noticed. I've experienced unexplainable things before but NEVER to this degree. The level of despair and emotion I felt was so strong. The picture of the man's face, so clear... As you can imagine, I didn't sleep that night. I spent the rest of the night upstairs reading books, fighting the desire to shut my eyes in fear of whatever I thought was attached to that clock would come after me.

For a week straight I was haunted by this clock and what I thought was a demon attached to it. The number of lies I believed from the devil took over and I refused to sleep in my room for over a week straight. I wanted that clock gone. I told my parents about the incident. I said, "We have to get it out of this house ASAP!"

I understand how crazy this all sounds but it can be hard to believe myself. I can be a skeptic too. I'm sure I have a lot of the same questions you might have about the whole thing. No matter what, I still wanted that thing out of the house. Something I once enjoyed became a nightmare in just a few moments.

The day came when I was finally going to stand up to whatever was attached to the clock. I grabbed a balloon and set it next to the clock still laying on the floor at the foot of my bed. Waiting to see if anything would happen. Of course, nothing did. To be fair, I was extremely sleep deprived at this point and full of paranoia. Don't judge, I'm sure if you've ever experienced something similar to what I did, you would understand. After this little experiment, I was fed up with letting this stupid clock have power over me. I grabbed the clock and began dragging it out of my room in annoyance. It was about 3 feet from my room before I start hysterically crying because while attempting to get this thing out of my room, I felt an even deeper feeling of dread than the night I first experienced it. I wasn't even sure where I was going to put the damn thing. The stairs leading to the main level felt so far away and the clock felt heavier than ever. I'm sobbing now.. My mother tells my dad "Help Him. Help Him!" Barely able to stand I yell "Get it out of here!" I didn't want to look at the clock let alone touch it ever again. The next thing I remember is sitting in the family room watching my dad shut the front door. I couldn't handle it removing the power this clock had over me by myself. I'm thankful for my parents. They helped me through the whole thing after getting the clock out of the house. Still on the property, but at least it was out of here I'm not sure if they believe me, but like I said before, I don't care. I know what I saw, I know what I felt.

I wanted to smash the clock into pieces, to burn it. But at the same time, I didn't want to, in fear of releasing whatever was attached to it out to the world. If I destroyed it, would the demon go back to where he came from? Or would it find a new host of some sort? Nobody should have to experience something like that. I don't understand how all these things work. I'm no Ed or Lorraine Warren. All I knew is I wanted it away from me and my family. Here's a tip, everyone: be careful what you buy from thrift stores or any pre-owned wood material item.

The story doesn't stop here though but it's getting late, and a horror movie seems suitable tonight. Let me know if you want part 2 of this story. Sweet dreams.
