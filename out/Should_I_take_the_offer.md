College. Some called it a waste of money, a way to open new doors; some even called it the best way to date! It was just a means to an end, a way to get a fancy piece of paper that enabled me to enter the business world. But, maybe, just maybe, I should have paid some more attention in my classes and less attention to the clock on the wall that counted down when I'd be free to run to the meal hall. But here I am, 4 years later, a bachelor's in psychology and no want, or way, to continue into a master's program, barely paying the monthly bills in my dead-end job as a grocer. Or at least that was the case until a few days ago.



Let me give you a quick breakdown of how I ended up in my current predicament. It was a typical Tuesday. I was checking customers out and having friendly, small conversations! "Hello, how are you?"



They would respond, "Oh, that's fine. I'm just buying some groceries for the week! You know how it goes."



The conversation would end as I handed them their receipt, only to see them throw it in the garbage. (So that you know, you're always welcome to decline it; most don't mind.)



But anyway, I'm wandering. Probably cause of how strange the whole damn thing was. The weirdest part was the temperature. Our store is typically kept at a pleasant 75℉, but as the customer walked up, I just felt the temperature drop; it wasn't noticeable at first, maybe a degree or two, then 3, 4, 5, it just kept slipping as he approached, this tall man, about 6'6", giant of a dude, in a long black trenchcoat, and a black fedora, completely covering him.



The temp had to be in the low 50s by the time he walked up! I was shivering to high hell, wrapping my arms around me. Hell, the dude in front of me (if I can even call him that; it was kinda tricky to make out his gender, was breathing out a visible cloud of hot air. The strange thing is no one noticed. Not even my coworker at the next stand; they didn't even look cold. No, it was just me, shivering away like a fucking maniac, teeth chattering. I'm sure most people would call that weird, but it gets stranger, I swear.



I decided against commenting on the noticeable temperature drop (I'm just praying to God it was a weird malfunction of the A.C.!) and instead asked, "Uhh, sir? Do you have any goods that you're buying today?"



And in the graveliest voice I've heard, like a Batman impression done shittily, I listen to him respond, "Yes… Just… This… Piece… Of… Fruit….", and in that same bizarrely delayed tone, he sets down a rotten, moldly, apple, that looks to have expired last year. Hell, I couldn't see a sticker on it anywhere!



I respond, "Uhhh, sir? That apple seems to have gone bad; would you prefer another?" I shoot him a polite smile, chock-full of all the nervousness of a kid about to be beaten!



"No… Thank… You… And… What… Do… You… Mean… Expired…?" God, you could feel the air drop another 10 degrees in that instance, hell it felt like time was slowing down with it, and I could feel my heart being gripped in my chest as he looked down at me… and Oh god, I shouldn't have made eye contact with him, god, fuck, it was like looking into the sky on a pitch black night, knowing damn well that if you died, you wouldn't be found… God, I regretted everything I'd done up to that point… I felt like death was just around the corner.



"Sorry, sir! I must be seeing things. This apple is excellent! That'll be $4.50!" I chipped out, desperate to have him forget my comment. But I saw that he didn't believe me. I needed a different solution now, so I tried something else.



"Uhhh, sorry, sir! I'm just tired from searching for work. It must be causing me to hallucinate." I felt him look confused for a second, and I could feel my heart unclench. At that moment, I knew I wouldn't be dying today, at least not from that giant of a human. Thankfully, I wouldn't be dying from that giant of a human.



"Work… You… Say…? What… Kind… Of… Work…?” I watched, in great relief, as his hand scratched his chin.



"Just work as a therapist, sir! I've been looking, but no one seems to be looking for an untested bachelor's degree holder." I watched then as he slowly reached into his pocket, that same damn slowness. Also, I should note that the store was dead quiet at this point. I didn't dare to look away from him, but I could see, just barely, out of the corner of my eye, my coworker, doing the most perfect impression of a statue.



"I… Have… Work…, I… Run… A… Clinic…. I… Need… Labor… Would… You… Like… To… Be… Our… In… House… Therapist…?” As he set down a piece of paper in front of me, I watched as his glove brushed against the table, and I saw, cold… just… cold… as his glove stroked across the plastic belt of the table, this ice, spread, like an effect from an anime, just this circular sprout of ice!



"I…. I'll need to consider it! Thank you for the offer, though, sir!" I'd had the feeling that if I turned him down there, he'd turn me into a fucking ice sculpture!



"Your… Ability… To… See… Me… Impresses… Me… I… Hope… You'll… Consider… Correctly…” And with those words, without even purchasing his apple. He left…, and as he left, I watched as time began to speed back up, and things went back to normal… from sound… to my coworkers… to my own body… hell… even the table looked normal again. As soon as I felt safe, I had a weird compulsion to analyze this… flyer? Ticket? Pamphlet? It's a little hard to tell because it was almost crumbling in my hands as I read it… “\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Sanatorium” it read. Contact at the bottom, and nothing else really out of the ordinary with it? God, I'm pretty sure I must be crazy or just dead tired. There is no way in hell that time could freeze like that. Right?



Anyway, I got off work a few hours later, and nothing of note happened after; if anything, people seemed to avoid my aisle with a grimace after he left. And that leads me to send this off to you, weird internet folks! I'm genuinely considering this job; I feel it'll be exciting, right? Anyways, what do you all think?
