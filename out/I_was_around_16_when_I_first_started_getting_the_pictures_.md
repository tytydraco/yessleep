I was 16 when I started getting the photos. It seemed to come out of the blue, but I assume it was because whatever was taking them saw I was now grabbing the mail for my mom since I started getting mail from colleges and work. It was normal for a while until one day, when I tossed them onto the table I saw there was a small pink envelope in the mix. I looked for any signs as to whom it was from, but I couldn’t find anything on it, it was completely blank.

I assumed it was for my mom since it was her birthday a few days ago, but it didn’t say her name or anything. I looked out the window, suddenly hearing every single sound around me. I contemplated for what felt like ten minutes whether I should open it or not. I looked at it, biting my lip in hesitation, before slowly opening it. Sitting in the envelope were seven photos. I picked them up and flipped them over.

They were photos of me, photos of me changing. 

I felt my body coil up and my stomach turned. I felt as if I was going to throw up.  I ran to my room and called Markus frantically over and over until he picked up, I was stuttering, and all I could manage to get out was “Please hurry, Something’s watching me!” Five minutes later Markus was there. I heard his car pull up and him run through the door. He looked at me worried. I must have looked like a mess, I was curled up on the couch, tears running down my face. He walked into the living room and sat on the couch with me. I picked up the photos and showed him four of the photos telling him the other three were nude photos.

“When did you get these?”

“T…today,” I said.

He looked at the picture for a bit. “When do you think they took them?”

“I…I don’t know.”

I put my face in my hands and I started to bawl again, tears flowing from my eyes. Markus, He hugged me tightly. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” He said holding his hand on the back of my head.  I didn’t know what to do, or what to think, I felt embarrassed, someone had been watching me change, I felt stupid for changing in front of my window, and I felt it was my fault. I wanted to call the police, to tell my parents what happened, but my mom had been arguing with my dad to move for months, and he had just convinced her to stay, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t live to uproot my life, to lose Markus. I looked up at him. I told Markus to promise not to tell my parents.

“I don’t think that a good idea.” He said pulling away from me.

“I can’t tell them.” I cried.

“You have to, this could get worse, you don’t know what could happen.” He said sternly.

“ NO, we’ll move, she’ll never let me come here again, please, please don’t do this, I can’t, I don’t want to leave, I don’t want to leave you.” I grabbed his shirt, begging. “Please, Promise me, promise you won't tell them.”

He swallowed and nodded his head reluctantly. I loosened my grip on his shirt and hung my head. He put his hand on my back.

“I just can’t lose my best friend,” I said, my voice broken, and raw.

”You won't, don’t worry. I promise I won’t tell them.”

I nodded, tears dripping onto my lap.

“You want me to stay over, just for tonight?”. he asked quietly.

Markus hadn’t slept over in forever, I didn’t even know if my parents would let him, but I wanted to try,  I was too scared to sleep alone. A few hours later my parents got home, Markus and I put on a movie while my parents made dinner. I was shaking all day, staring out the window, trying to see if someone was there. Markus tried his best to comfort me, but with every shadow I saw in the corner of my eye, my fears just came back. All through our meal I was giving glances to Markus. I could feel my muscles tense the whole time. I felt stiff, I could barely even keep track of my conversations, all I could hear was the sound of my heart.

I just sat in silence hoping he wouldn’t say anything to my parents, and he didn’t. Afterward, my dad offered to watch a movie with us, but we declined. My mom was in the kitchen grabbing something, so I figured it would be the best time to take my chance. I completed dinner, before asking if Markus could sleep over. My dad said yes since he trusts Markus, I mean we’ve known each other for so long, I could never even imagine putting that much trust in anyone else., we said goodnight and walked upstairs before my mom came out of the kitchen.  I could feel Markus’s uneasiness. I reassured him that it was best if we didn’t tell them, but he said nothing. He walked to the guest bedroom and started to open the door.

“Wait,” I said putting a hand out. “Can you stay in my room tonight?”

He looked at me. “Like…on the floor?”

I put my hands on my hips. “Yes on the floor,” I said raising an eyebrow.

“Yeah, yeah sorry.” He laughed a bit. “Just let me get some blankets and pillows, and I’ll be right there.”

I sat on my bed and waited for Markus to come back. I turned off my light before walking to the window. I looked out, it was dark, but not so dark that I couldn’t see. I looked down the street, at the houses, the shadow between them, but there was no one. I knew they were there though. I could feel it. I raised my middle finger to the window and sat on my bed. I instantly felt stupid and quickly covered the window with my curtains. Markus kicked the door open lightly before tossing a handful of blankets and pillows on the floor. I helped set him up the blankets and we started talking

“ I was walking around Hershey (Hershey is the neighboring town near us ) with Ted yesterday. There was a poster at the theatre that said they were showing Alien.”

“That’s cool, when is it?” I asked,

“ Next Friday, if you wanna come that’d be great.” He said leaning against the wall behind him.

“Yeah, of course I would.” I smiled.

Markus opened his mouth to say something, but my mom walked in.

“What are you two doing up still, it’s almost midnight.” She asked.

“Sorry.” Markus smiled.

“It’s ok, you guys have a good day at school?” She walked into the room and leaned on the desk behind her. My eyes widened in absolute horror, I put the pictures right behind her, just facing up. Markus noticed my fear and stood up.

“It was fine, how was work,” Markus asked.

“Same old same old, no one understands that when houses are up for sale the furniture in the pictures doesn’t come with it.”She laughed a little. Markus didn’t understand.“Sometimes people allow home tours while they still live in it.” She said.

Markus nodded now understanding, he looked down at his phone "Sorry, my mom's calling, I’ll be right back.” Markus walked next to my mom. “Oh also I got Billie a new poster, you like it?” Markus asked my mom, pointing to the wall.

My mom turned her head, to see what he was talking about, and he quickly shoved the pictures into his pocket, before walking downstairs. She turned back around to ask which one, but he had already walked away. She turned to me laughing a little.“You actually like dinner?”.

“Yeah, it was good.”

“I’m glad.” She leaned her hip on the wall, she looked up at the wall.  “ Well your father and I are tired, so goodnight, I love you.”

“Goodnight Mom.”.

“Go to bed.” She said jokingly, pointing a finger at me. She smiled, but it quickly faded. A sad expression washed over her. I followed her trail out of sight to see the blankets on the floor.

“Oh, Markus is staying in my room tonight, is that ok?”

She looked at me, quickly snapping out of her small trance. I knew she wanted to say something, “Uh…” I saw her fidgeting with her fingers. “Uh yeah, yeah that’s fine.” She said. Her face turned pink. She bit her lip.“I trust you.”. She gave a brief smile before leaving and closing the door behind her.  Markus came back inside with a distressed look on his face.

“Your mom ok?” He asked.

“Why.”

“She gave me a look.”

I shrugged it off,  I didn’t really want to explain it and make Markus feel unwelcome. We shortly went to bed after talking a bit more. I slept way better than I had in a while, even with everything I found today. Markus really helped, despite the fact he was on the floor, it was comforting to have his company. Halfway through the night Markus and I were scared shitless from a call I got on my computer. Markus forgot to turn off the automatic call.

“Shit sorry Billie.” He said after taking a breath. He walked over to my computer and declined the call.

“You gotta make that call a different time,” I said.

“Yeah, I know, sorry.” He laid back on the floor, before falling back asleep.

I tried to fall asleep but just ended up staring at the ceiling. I was looking at all the decorations on my wall when I heard something outside the window. I tried not to pay much mind to it, it happened all the time, but whatever was making the nose outside wasn't stopping. I wanted to shut my eyes, but I couldn't. I felt if I did it would come inside my room. I slowly turned to the window, but there was nothing. Just the tree branches dragging along the window, whistling in the wind. I stood up and looked out the window. I put my hands to the side of my eyes and pressed my face up to the window’s glass. There was someone standing outside, and I saw they were holding something, I couldn’t tell what it was from that far, but I assumed it was a camera.

 I don’t know why I did this, but I threw my shoes on and ran outside. I looked at the street around me, it was too dark out to see anything. I felt frustrated, I knew it was that pervert,  I didn’t know what I wanted to do, I wanted them to pay, to feel as stupid and embarrassed as I did, but I couldn’t do anything. I realized how stupid it was to run outside and leave the door open behind me. I walked back in locking the door.

“Honey, why are you up?”

My mother said behind me. She scared the shit out of me, she repeated herself, her voice was raspy and harsh. I straightened my posture and turned around. I could see the outline of my mother, but her body was hidden by shadows.

“Sorry, Mom,” I said, stuttering.

“Why are you up?”She repeated for a third time.

“I thought I saw something and I went to check on it, I’m sorry.”.

“It’s midnight.”She said.

“I know I'm sorry, I'll go to bed.” I could see she nodded slightly, before hanging her head.

“They don’t understand.” She said under her breath.

“What?” I asked. She looked up at me. She was silent for a few seconds.

“Goodnight.” She said lowly.

“Goodnight,” I said reluctantly. I walked up the stairs looking back. my mom just stood there, watching as I walked upstairs. I tried to focus on her face but I couldn't.

“Mom? Are you ok?” I asked timidly

she said nothing before slowly nodding her head, it sends a shiver down my spine. I walked upstairs and locked my door behind me. Markus woke up and asked me what was wrong. I said I was ok, and that it was nothing. The next morning my mom was fine, so I chalked it up to her sleepwalking.

Later after lunch, I decided to go off on a run. I just wanted to blow off some steam, and it was still somewhat nice out, so it was perfect for me. I was about a half hour from home, I took the bike trail up through the woods, and I stopped to check my phone, it was only 4:30 ish so I had a good amount of time before it got dark. I thought I saw something from the corner of my eye, I whipped around. I didn’t see anything. I took my headphones out and listened. It was quiet before a squirrel jumped down from a branch, I will admit I jumped a little, I sighed in relief before going back on my phone. 

I started walking back for a bit before I noticed something on the ground. I white piece of paper? I picked it up, before flipping it around, It was a picture of me, from last night. I was leaning up against my window. My hands began to shake, at the bottom, in sloppy handwriting it looked like it said “My love.”

 I looked back up at the road ahead of me, I was all alone, what could I do, I was a mile away from any road, and I was stuck, I turned to look behind me when someone grabbed the back of my shirt and pushed me down, onto the side of the trail.  As I fell I landed on the uneven harsh ground. The wind was knocked right out of me. I felt like I could barely breathe, I tried my best to gasp for air.

I felt a deep sharp pain in my ankle. I yelled in pain and covered my head pleading for them to stop, to leave me alone, that I wouldn’t tell anyone. I started to cry hysterically, but they did nothing. I tried turned to look at them, but they grabbed at my hair shoving my face into the ground. I could hear their disgusting heavy breaths, and their body pressed against mine, I felt a panic I'd never felt before and never felt after, I started to scream desperately for them to get off of me. I screamed with every ounce of energy I had left I heard their heavy breaths as got off of me, but I could feel them hovering over me. 

I dug my hands into the dirt, and I cried and cried before they grabbed at my arm and flipped me over, I swung my arms around before I saw a young woman looking back at me. She looked at me terrified. She sat me up asking if I was alright. I couldn’t even process what she was saying, I felt like I was thinking, but nothing made sense to me, I just looked at her. She sat me up against a tree and called 911. 

I was taken to the hospital and found that they had broken my ankle, and I fractured a rib when I fell on my stomach. My parents came into my room soon after the police were done talking with me, my mom cried hysterically, while my dad tried to calm her down. I was stuck kinda just awkwardly watching. After a bit, she calmed down and was able to talk. I told them about the attacker, I kinda couldn’t hide it from them. I still didn’t tell them about the photos, and the one I found right before I was attacked.

 My mom insisted on moving, but I hysterically broke down crying, and she eventually agreed to stay. I could tell she was holding on to this town by a string and anything would set her off. I asked them to leave, and they went home a few minutes later, after kissing me goodnight. I sat in bed staring at the ceiling when a nurse knocked on the door gently. I tried to sit up, but I couldn’t really move too much without pain shooting through me. 

“A young man brought these for you.” She said kindly.

I smiled a little, thinking about what stupid note Markus could’ve written me. “Thank you.” I took the bouquet and placed it on the counter next to me.

“He’s he a boyfriend?” She asked casually.

“No, just a friend. Since childhood.” 

“That’s sweet of him.” She said, passing me the small envelope stuffed between the flowers. She smiled at me one more time and left the room.

I looked down at the note, before opening it slowly, careful not to rip the envelope. I took a small notecard out and unfolded it.

“I’m sorry I grabbed you so harshly I promise it was an accident, I hope you feel better soon my love, I'll be much nicer next time” 

I knew this fucking handwriting, I crumbled the note and threw it at the wall, I screamed grabbing at my hair. A few nurses rushed in, asking me what was wrong. I just screamed non senselessly pointing at the crumpled piece of paper, none of them even looked at the note, they just assured me I was safe, and tossed it away. I didn’t sleep at all that night, or the rest of the time I was in the hospital.

When I got out of the hospital, I stopped staying at my house as much. I would try to go to Markus's house for nights at a time, even weeks at some points. My mom disapproved of this, but I didn't really care anymore, I just wanted to be out of that house, away from that thing. I still kept receiving the photos, but they were never from outside of Markus's place, only mine. I started changing in the bathroom with the door closed, so the photos would be of me standing there, working, talking on the phone, or doing anything really. I tried setting up a camera in my room, but it never picked up anything.

I felt ill almost every day, every time I would try to eat I would just throw up soon after, and I started losing weight. Markus tried his best to comfort me, but it didn't really work. He took me to every social event he could to get those damn pictures out of my mind, but with every face I saw, I just wondered if one of them was them if I would meet the face of whoever had been watching me, but of course, I would never know.

How could I?
