Well hello there Reddit…longtime lurker here and unfortunately I think I need help. I really didn’t want to take this avenue, but I don’t know if I have any options here. Sorry if this is a bit long; there’s a lot of context that needs to be included for this to make even a little bit of sense. 

Let me preface this by saying that I am not really a believer in the paranormal. I may be a writer, but I can still tell the difference between reality and imagination. The only reason I’m even writing this is because my more superstitious friends begged me to.

One of my friends, Greg (honestly, “friend” is a stretch – we tolerate him because he’s the only one who’s 21. Do with that what you will) is one of those urban explorer types, always finding strange places to terrorize. A couple weeks back, he mentioned hearing about a local cemetery that he wanted to check out. Our other friend, Ellis, who is a native of the area, said that this cemetery in particular was one of the oldest in the city and housed some cool mausoleums and spooky urban legends. Somehow the pair managed to convince my high school friend JD, our token gold-hearted himbo frat boy and truck owner, to drive them the two miles to said cemetery that Friday. 

My long-time best friend and roommate Lillie dragged me along – she‘s constantly trying to convince me to get out and about more. I believe this time her exact words were “you have to unglue your nose from your books and computer and actually exist for once.” I tried to remind her that most pharmacy majors are too busy to bother with free time or friends, but her enthusiasm was infectious. When she gets excited about something, she starts bouncing on the tips of her toes and grinning like a cat, eyes full of eagerness for the next bout of playful trouble she can get herself into. So the five of us and two six-packs of beer piled into JD’s truck and headed to the old graveyard once the sun set. 

Fortunately, the gates to the cemetery were locked. Unfortunately, JD made the grave mistake of pointing out a rather strange-looking single story building across the street. “What do y’all think that might be?”

“Not sure,” Greg responded, poking his head between the front row’s headrests to get a better look. I leaned away from him, trying to hide my distaste at his general cigarette-and-sweat odor. “Wanna go check it out?” 

I started to protest, but was immediately overruled by Ellis, Greg and Lillie, who were practically clamoring for JD to park the truck so they could explore. JD let out a long-suffering sigh, lips twitching into a smile, and relented, pulling up next to the building. Lillie bounced out of the truck, Ellis and Greg not far behind. I rolled my eyes at JD, who chuckled and ruffled my hair. “Is little miss Hazel scared?”

“Shut up,” I grumbled, batting his hand away as we joined the trio already waiting nervously at the edge of the property. There were no lights on in or near the building, save for an eerie cerulean glow leaking out from behind a frosted window that was in stark contrast with the red brick and white colonial columns of the exterior. The five of us stood in silence for a moment, on edge and unsure of what exactly this strange structure was. Something about the architecture felt…off, like the walls were too high, or the width of the windows wasn’t quite right. I fought off a shudder and rubbed my arms to remind myself to stop being childish – it’s just an old building that happens to have had an eccentric designer and is across the street from a massive cemetery.

“It’s a toy hospital,” Greg said, squinting at the aged sign hanging over the dark wooden door. Ellis was already looking up the name of the business, shoving their long purple hair out of their eyes and squinting at their phone. 

“It’s currently in business,” they mused, scrolling through the website. “Listen to this: ‘About us – We painstakingly search thrift stores and garage sales for any abandoned friends, bring them to our hospital, and get them fixed up for adoption. If you’re interested in making the lifelong commitment of caring for one of our rehabilitated patients, you can come to one of our meet-and-greets or fill out an adoption application form.’” 

I frowned and glanced over at Ellis, making sure to keep the building in my periphery. Something about the blue light in the window was putting me on edge. “A meet and greet with who? The owners?”

Ellis shook their head, a look of confusion and distaste on their face. “No…I think with the toys. These people have petting zoos for their stuffed animals, robot cleaning services – $100 for a cleaning service? Christ, that’s practically highway robbery.” 

Greg snorted and stood on his toes to try and peer into a window. “Who wants to go in first?”

Of course, Lillie took the first step towards the entrance.

“Lillie, no!” I hissed, smacking her arm and glancing around to make sure there was nobody watching us. “Going along with a guy who willingly paid for a Pickle Rick tattoo? That’s the worst idea you’ve had at least this week.” I ignored Greg’s scoff and middle finger and kept my eyes on Lillie. 

She laughed and took another step, playfully wiggling her eyebrows at me. “Oh come on, Hazel, there’s nobody here, and I doubt there’s cameras. Besides, who knows what sorts of fun creepy shit could be in there?” I threw my hands up in the air in resignation, and the four of us watched as Lillie crept up to the front door. Each step seemed agonizingly drawn out, and with every inch Lillie gained, my shoulders grew more and more tense. My eyes flicked to that blue light again. It seemed to be gently pulsating now, almost as if something within the building was pulling Lillie in, hypnotizing her, calling to her with an obscene siren song. 

Everything went quiet the moment she set foot on the porch – the kind of oppressive quiet that shoves in on your eardrums, the pressure building and building until you can’t stand it anymore and the only thing you can do is take a needle or an ice pick or a knife and prick and poke and stab until they pop. 

Then Lillie pushed the door open. 

The click of the handle brought sound rushing back as the portal yawned, black and foreboding. I shivered again, glancing up at JD. He looked just as hesitant as I did. “Lillie, hold on a second-” But she had already disappeared into the interior of the toy hospital. We all went still, listening intently for any sign of danger. My heartbeat sounded loudly in my ears, and I tapped my foot nervously as I stared into the strange building. There was no sound, save for the breathing of my friends and the gentle rustle of wind in the trees. Something shifted behind a window, and I watched with apprehension as the blue luminance shrank and shrank until it was a mere flicker. 

Just as that sinister light finally surrendered to darkness, a piercing scream rent the silence around us. JD swore and bolted towards the entrance, Ellis and I not far behind. We had barely made it ten feet before Lillie scrambled frantically backwards out of the door, almost like a crab scuttling away from a predator. She leapt up and ran to us, green eyes wild and box-bleached hair disheveled as terrified, wordless sounds spilled from her mouth. 

“Lillie! Lillie, take a breath-” I clutched her shoulders and forced her to look at me. “What the hell happened?”

Her gaze flicked from the doorway to me and back again. I’ll never forget the look on her face. Lillie and I have known each other for years. I’ve seen her eyes full of joy and enthusiasm, seen them swollen and swimming with tears, seen them exhausted and desolate. But never before had I seen the boundless distress and disgust and abject horror that I saw in her face that night.

Lillie gasped for air, burying her face in my shoulder as she trembled. “I…I don’t know…I thought I felt something push me…and there was a gasping sound right in my ear-” Her voice shook as I held her and JD gently rubbed her back. I glanced back at Greg, who unsurprisingly hadn’t moved from his spot on the sidewalk. He just looked confused and slightly curious, not a hint of fear or concern on his face.  

Once I had calmed Lillie down enough so she could walk without her knees giving way, we climbed back into JD’s truck and hightailed it back to campus. Ellis, Greg and I peppered her with questions about what touched her, if she saw anything, what the inside of the toy hospital looked like. She didn’t answer any of them, saying she wanted to just move on and not think about it. The drained, faraway look in her eyes was enough to convince us to leave her be.

JD dropped us off at our respective dorms about fifteen minutes later. Lillie seemed fine the next morning – a bit tired, but in good enough spirits. I tried to get her to come with me for a late breakfast at our dorm’s dining hall, but she shook her head and said she was expecting a call from her mom. I brought her back a waffle, and to my surprise, she wolfed it down like she hadn’t eaten anything in days. 

None of our other friends said anything about our misadventure for the rest of the week. I think we all just wanted to forget about it and let the semester carry on – Halloween was coming up, and we all wanted to get ahead on homework so we could spend the last week of October partying. I followed their lead, pushing the memory of the experience far away into the mental realm where dreams and wishes and nightmares live. It didn’t stop me from worrying about Lillie, though. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but she seemed to be losing weight despite the sudden uptick in her appetite. When I asked her about it, she just chalked it up to being busy with midterms. I agreed, not because I actually thought this was the case, but because I desperately wanted the explanation to be something as average as a hefty workload.

Lillie was fine until the other night. I woke up at two in the morning, shaken by the distinct feeling of being watched. I’m prone to night terrors, so this isn’t new to me, but something felt different this time. I had to blink blearily a few times before my mind could fully process what I was seeing. Lillie was standing stock-still in the middle of our room, facing the window. Her back was to me, body stiff as a board, fingers stretched out and rigid at her sides.

 “Lillie?” I called out softly, sitting up and peering closer. She didn’t move, save for a twitch of her fingers as I stood up and circled around to face her. Lillie’s eyes were completely shut, irises frantically darting back and forth underneath her lids. “Hey, L, wake up,” I said, gently tapping her shoulder, unsure of what to do. Her throat worked as if she were trying to say something, but her mouth didn’t move. My eyes fell to the shift of her esophagus, and I stumbled back, almost falling onto her bed at what I saw. It looked almost as if she had swallowed a glow stick, soft, blue light leaking out through the muscle and around her windpipe. 

Almost as soon as I noticed the peculiarity, it vanished. Lillie took a deep, heaving breath as her eyes flew open and her body relaxed. She ran a hand through her hair,  forehead creasing a bit in confusion. “Hazel? What’s wrong?”

All I could do for a moment was stare at her, trying to process what I had seen. My mind darted around for an excuse, but all I could say was, “You-you were sleepwalking.”

Lillie shook her head, clearly still half-asleep. “That’s weird. Sorry if I freaked you out.” I just shook my head, opening my mouth to try and explain. But before I could find the words, she gave a jaw-cracking yawn, flopped onto her bed, and went back to sleep.

I tossed and turned all night, trying to rationalize what I had seen, even flipping through some of my pharmacy textbooks for any kind of explanation. Nothing. There was no scientific reasoning that I could find for why Lillie’s throat had been lit up from the inside. I finally caved and texted JD and Ellis, hoping they might have some insight. JD had no idea, but Ellis said that it could be something paranormal and possibly related to the toy hospital we visited. Ellis is terribly predisposed to seeking out more fantastical answers over mundane ones (and was actually the one to suggest asking Reddit), but their comment did help me make one terrible, disturbing connection. 

The luminous glow emanating from Lillie’s throat was the same shade as the cerulean light at the toy hospital. 

I don’t know what to do. The last few nights Lillie has been sleepwalking more, and yesterday I caught her trying to somnambulate out of the dorm room. She’s never sleep walked before and seems completely oblivious to her late-night antics. I don’t know if I should tell her, or if that would make things worse. Lillie has already been through way too much, and I don’t want to add to her already heavy mental struggles. 

So that’s why I’m here, asking strangers on the internet for advice on how to help my friend. At this point I don’t really care what the explanation is, as long as I have one, because right now I am at a complete loss. Any thoughts, suggestions, or the like would be much appreciated.
