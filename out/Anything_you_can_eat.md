”Anything?” 

“That’s right.” Answered the server with a grin.

“Just show me the menu.” I said in a slightly too aggressive tone of voice. That kid in the ill-fitting black apron was probably slaving away for an absolutely abysmal paycheck. I had been there myself and under other circumstances I’d probably feel sorry for him, but right now he was really getting on my nerves. Frankly this whole place was getting on my nerves. 

Why did I think it would be a good idea to stop here in the first place? I already knew the answer to that question. It was the sign that drew me in. “Anything you can eat” it said, not “All you can eat”. I had already seen plenty of those and I wasn’t in the mood to puke my guts out after eating rancid shrimps again.  Back when I was a broke, starving college kid, cheap buffets  were what kept me going. Although they sometimes gave me stomach cramps, I much preferred it to not eating at all. Anything was better than hunger. But hunger wasn’t really a concern for me anymore. Since my food blog had taken off I pretty much got paid for stuffing my face. Review a restaurant, a sponsor deal here or there, a patreon page. I wasn’t making a lot of money, but I was doing what I loved. 

The way other people talked about their passions and life goals was how I talked about food. I had always had a voracious appetite. In fact my mother used to say that I would eat her out of the house one day. I do want to give myself some credit though and say that I’m not just some mindless glutton. My interest in food runs deeper than the pursuit of temporary physical pleasure. I am and have always been interested in the components that make up my food and the specific and intricate techniques that turn those ordinary components into a meal. I would say that it was this eye for detail that first made me stand out and helped my tiny blog gain traction in the oversaturated world of wannabe internet food critics.

Here I was sitting in this ordinary, but somewhat peculiar diner, talking way too loudly to an acne scarred waiter in his late teens. 

“Sir, we don’t have a menu here. Just tell me what you’re craving and we will cook it up for you.”

I felt like I had been tricked into a silly game, but I decided to play along. If I ignored the absolute logistical impossibility of such a concept, the proposal sounded like a dream come true. Sadly, I already knew the reality of restaurants that promised unsuspecting customers dishes from every corner of the world.  It started in a factory, hibernated in a walk-in freezer and finished in the microwave, before landing on said customers plate. Yet, I had never seen a restaurant without a menu. Sure, I had been to upscale restaurants with set menus that changed every night, but they were still planned out beforehand. This was way different. It would certainly make for some interesting content for my blog.

I decided to start off easy to give the poor kid a fighting chance, so I ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs. Almost any restaurant can offer a passable rendition of this dish, but the devil really is in the details. Frozen and reheated meatballs always have a slightly rubbery texture, that I’d be able to recognise from a mile away and the prepackaged tomato sauce is usually way too flavorless and contains way too much sugar and salt to compensate for that fact. The server quickly scribbled down my order and shuffled over to what I presumed to be the kitchen. I opened my laptop and started taking notes. This was work after all. I had barely gotten anywhere when I heard the faint sound of a bell and there he was again. The young server stood right by my table with an enormous plate of pasta balanced in his right hand.

 “I could tell that you were hungry.” He said. “Enjoy.” 

I must have gotten lost in my notes and missed him walking over, but the experience still left me feeling unnerved. As he began walking away again I started my usual routine. The dish definitely looked the part. It was even adorned with some Parmesan cheese and what appeared to be a fresh sprig of basil. If I hadn’t known any better I would have been fooled, but I had been around the block and I had seen the places that pandered to food photographers by serving photogenic, but utterly flavorless food. I particularly remember the rainbow salad bowl I had at an airport once. All colors of the rainbow were there, but it all tasted like various shades of soggy cardboard. 

I bit into one of the meatballs. It wasn’t rubbery at all. It was… perfect. I almost forgot that I was there as a critic first and foremost. I started to eat, no devour, the spaghetti and meatballs. I really was hungry. And then I wasn’t hungry anymore. I felt completely satisfied. I had planned to review several different dishes, but that was clearly going to have to wait for another day. I began looking around for the kid, but he was nowhere to be found. In fact, the whole diner was empty. Was it this empty when I got here? I couldn’t even remember. 

After trying to get the waiter's attention for what felt like hours I gave up and decided to leave the money on the table. It was then I realized that he had never specified a price, nor had I asked. Since the quality of both the food and the service was way above what I expected I left 30 dollars and some change and stumbled out of the restaurant feeling almost drunk. 

They say that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. If you made a poll of popular food choices, spaghetti and meatballs would be fairly high on that list along with junk food mainstays like pizza and hamburgers. Perhaps it was simply a clever illusion of infinite choice. But, why? As I lay awake, tossing and turning, I felt like I was in the midst of something incomprehensible and sinister. All my attempts at a rational explanation for what had transpired seemed laughable in the emptiness of the night. Almost as laughable as my strange, paranoid train of thought seemed when I woke up the next day. I am a food critic. I know the tricks of the trade and I certainly don’t believe in magical restaurants. This time was going to be different. I would stay observant and critical and wouldn’t let myself get carried away. Since my fridge was empty and I hadn’t gotten around to shopping yesterday I immediately got dressed and got into my car.

I didn’t even know whether it was going to be open or not, but the neon sign was shining almost as bright as the morning sun when I pulled over from the freeway. I went in through the glass door with determination and a clear goal in mind. I started ordering breakfast. Full English breakfasts. Sausages cooked to perfection, freshly made sourdough toast, fried eggs so crisp, yet creamy that you wouldn’t believe it. I then ordered some French toast. Perfectly fluffy and sweet. What about hash browns? Also perfect.

I moved on to lunch. I ordered all the dishes that I could think of and then some. They were all perfect. Too perfect. But not in an artificial way. Just perfect. Nothing seemed to pose a challenge. I even ordered beef wellington, a dish that takes an experienced chef several hours to prepare. I didn’t know what to think. My mind was spinning like a wheel as I got ready for the grand finale. I put in my final order with a slight quiver in my voice, but the waiter didn’t even stop for a second. He just took my order straight to the kitchen.

He soon returned with a bowl of tomato soup, which he placed in front of me. With shaky hands I carefully lifted the spoon to my mouth and took a sip. All doubt still left in my mind disappeared, as tears started pouring down my cheeks. I got up and left. I never went back and I never wrote about it until now. I never found the secret I was searching for, but I know one thing for certain. I would be able to recognise my mother’s tomato soup anywhere. Yet, my mother has  been dead for many years now.
