[Here's my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1obblq6/my_twisted_house_arrest)

I don't remember when my last post was. Yesterday the clocks shut down. I can use the internet but anything telling me the time looks warped. My cell shuts off whenever I try to text anyone. Luckily Angela keeps coming by every couple days. I think.

The food and pantry is always stocked, the internet is always high speed, and the weather never changes. Every single day is the same, although that might have changed since a couple nights ago.

I was sleeping in my mom's old bed because her room is the biggest. I woke in the middle of the night and shot up. The first thing I seen was my reflection. I looked the way I had when I was a child. I looked down at my hands to see that my body hadn't changed, just my reflection.

I got out of bed and when I looked back at the mirror my reflection was gone. I froze. The younger version of myself left the room. Tentatively I walked to the bathroom. My reflection now showed me myself in my late teens. I watched as he washed his hands. Looking closer I could see scratches on his neck. His shirt was soaked with sweat from mowing the neighbor's lawn. I watched him dab rubbing alcohol against his neck. He winced. I didn't know what I was expecting but I approached the mirror.

"Can you see me?" I asked, receiving no reaction, "Hello?"

I knocked on the mirror and he jumped back, looking around the room with wide eyes. He looked straight at me then. His shoulders sagged. He said something but I couldn't read his lips. Suddenly he looked at the door and ran out. I went into my old room where I watched, through the mirror, him pull on a hoodie. He shot me an apologetic look before he left.

It was then I heard a knock on the door and I went downstairs to let Angela in. She set down a large tote on the table and turned to me, "I have the books you wanted."

"Thanks," I smiled awkwardly, my fists in my pockets, "Did you find my old neighbor?"

She stiffened for a second, "She's dead."

"Oh..."

"Would she have any reason to want to hurt you?"

"No. I was always nice to her but I can't think of anything else. Nothing else tying me to this place, anyway."

"Weird."

"Can you stay with me tonight?" I asked without meeting her gaze.

"Of course I can," I could hear the smile in her voice.

I stepped forward and pulled her into me. She tucked her face into the crook of my neck. I squeezed her tight, "I love you, baby."

"I love you, too."

The rest of the day was uneventful. We spent most of it watching movies and eating the snacks I enjoyed as a kid. In the morning she left for work.

After Angela left I got to reading. I couldn't get any insight to my situation but I was sure my old neighbor was a witch. Her name was Vanessa. She was in her forties. She had long, messy red hair, a pale, freckled face, a square chin, and a straight, small nose. She wore black dresses most of the time. Inside her basement were shelves lining every wall. They were filled with different spices, bones, and crystals. She had jars of preserved dead animals. Some sigils I saw in the book I recognized from her home.

She wasn't overly nice or mean. She was just odd. Still, I can't imagine any reason she'd want to hurt me. I need to ask Angela to knock on Vanessa's door the next time she comes over.
