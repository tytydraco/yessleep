An executive order was issued to all personnel at the institute today:

*Due to a recent incident at the optics lab, all employees handling Sample 4622 must do so with extreme care. They must be accompanied by at least two security staff members and an executive-level researcher during any handling of Sample 4622. Any violation of this order will result in immediate suspension and possibly a dishonorable discharge. Your safety is our highest priority. Remember to handle everything with care and that you’re here to make the world a better place, every single day.*

That’s a load of bull. Everyone knows we’re here to look at cool and strange stuff that no one else in the world has ever seen before. That’s why I, a lowly condensed matter physicist, work in such a prestigious place.

Besides, this incident happened months ago. Why issue this executive order now?

Just as I was about to run routine equipment calibration and check up on the cold lab, someone knocked on my door. I beckoned them to come in.

Director Anya, an intimidating woman with years of both field and research experience, entered the office and sat on the chair opposite me. Only the hardwood desk with my computer separated us.

We were silent for a few seconds before she spoke. “Hello. I have an assignment for you that is of high priority.”

Cutting right to the chase, as usual. No “hello,” no “how are you,” just “Here’s something you need to do. Do it before blah blah blah.” I don’t even know this woman personally. She just gives me assignments and leaves. She doesn’t even address me by my name.

“We have been receiving strange reports from two different small towns in the US, states apart from each other and continents away from us, that might be related to Sample 4622.”

Wait. What? I get to study Sample 4622? I read the initial report, and it described it as a black crystal of a perfect cube shape that neither reflects nor allows light to penetrate it. Didn’t the last person disappear after studying it with lasers?

“We need someone to understand the sample at an atomic level. It might give us insights into its behavior. A team of field agents investigating these strange occurrences retrieved this object from someone they interviewed. It appears to be a small piece of black opaque crystal. An extremely controlled study indicates that it behaves similarly to Sample 4622 at an optics level.”

“Hold up. Wait a second,” I said. “You want me to study this crystal that is highly likely related to that God-forsaken sample? How do I know I will be safe? Why me? I am not a senior researcher and most likely not the most knowledgeable in my field.”

“Didn’t you read the order?” Anya replied coldly. “You will be accompanied by both Romero and Jack, experienced members of the security team. Also, Dr. Campbell will be supervising you. However, his supervision will be more observatory rather than providing any level of management.”

“As for this assignment, apparently you’re the only one who has experience in both condensed matter physics research and using our facilities to study crystals and metals found in the field.”

I guess I’ll take that as a compliment. I’ve never worked with Dr. Campbell before, but that should be fine. My supervisor is Dr. Aisha. Lovely lady. Extremely direct and harsh when I make a mistake. But that’s okay. I like that.

“What happened to Dr. Aisha?” I inquired.

“She’s currently working on another assignment in Facility XJV-14. I sent her there to further investigate this sample and its connection with two persons we interviewed,” she replied. “When can you start?”

“After my routine checkup in the cold lab. I will also need to check that the scanning tunneling microscope is set up properly. Can I get additional help on this?”

“Of course,” she said. “I am assigning both Brandon and Helena to you. They are experienced lab technicians.”

“Okay,” I said nervously. “I will get started soon.”

I shook Anya’s hand and left my office. I headed straight to the cold lab.

The cold lab. My only sanctuary away from the real world. It’s the only place where I get to do what I want, which is to study cool metals and crystals at an atomic level and even change their behavior at a quantum level by chilling them to near absolute zero.

Near absolute zero, materials exhibit fascinating and often counterintuitive properties. Metals become superconductors, allowing electricity to flow without resistance. This phenomenon alone has captivated my interest for years. Imagine a world where energy loss is a thing of the past, where power grids are infinitely efficient. That’s the kind of future I dream about.

At these ultra-low temperatures, atoms slow down to a near standstill, revealing the quantum mechanical nature of matter. Materials can transition from being ductile to brittle, their electrical resistance can drop to zero, and they can even exhibit superfluidity, where a liquid flows without viscosity.

These changes are not just theoretical; they are the keys to unlocking new technologies and understanding the universe at its most fundamental level.

I love the precision required in this lab. Every experiment is a delicate dance with the laws of physics. The scanning tunneling microscope, my favorite tool, allows me to visualize materials at an atomic scale and even manipulate individual atoms. It’s like having a superpower, seeing the unseen and controlling the uncontrollable.

As I entered the cold lab, the familiar hum of the cryogenic equipment greeted me. The air was crisp, almost biting, a constant reminder of the extreme conditions we work under. I took a deep breath, feeling a sense of calm wash over me. Here, in this controlled environment, I could forget about the chaos outside and focus on the mysteries of the quantum world.

It took me a couple of hours to finish my routine equipment check-up and calibration in the lab. Everything was in tip-top condition, just like yesterday and the day before. Research can never be carried out properly with poorly maintained equipment.

I heard the door open and close. Just in time. That must be the team Director Anya sent to help with my research. Sure enough, there they were, standing near the entrance.

I greeted them. “Hello everyone. Welcome to the cold lab. My name is Dr. …”

“Yes, we know your name,” interrupted a rather short man. “We want to get right to it. My name is Dr. Campbell, and I will be watching over you today. I do not plan nor wish to manage you. I have other more pressing tasks than this.”

Great. My supervisor is an asshole. This will go smoothly. Not.

“Excuse me,” said a tall fellow in a standard security outfit. “My name is Romero, and this is my partner, Jack. We will be inside the cold lab, monitoring your progress. Don’t mind us; we won’t interfere with your work. Oh, and here’s the sample. Open the briefcase when you’re ready.”

Romero handed me the briefcase and returned to his partner. They seemed to be discussing security and monitoring plans for the lab. Nice guy though, much better than that asshole over there. Why do senior researchers always act like jerks? I wonder if I will act like that if or when I get promoted.

I placed the rather light briefcase on a desk and opened it. There it was, a beautiful black glass. At first glance, it looked like a gem carved by an experienced jeweler. Upon closer inspection, without touching it of course, I could see uneven edges and lines indicating it was broken off from a much larger piece. If this thing is related to Sample 4622, then how did it chip? That thing is nearly indestructible from what I read. Maybe it’s not related at all.

“Excuse me?” a woman said, interrupting my thoughts. “My name is Helena, and this is Brandon. We are the technicians and will assist you in your work. Tell us what we should do.”

I pondered this quietly for a few minutes. “The equipment in this lab is calibrated. This sample is small enough to be examined by the scanning tunneling microscope, so we will start with that as our initial investigation. Can you prepare and run the initial scans using the microscope? You can calibrate the bias voltage until you get a good enough image of the sample’s lattice structure.”

While Helena and Brandon were running the initial scans, I prepared my computer and stationeries to record our findings. The anticipation of uncovering the crystal lattice of this mysterious black sample was exhilarating. The atomic structure of materials can be fascinating and varied, each with its unique properties and patterns. Maybe this crystal would exhibit a hexagonal pattern like graphite, or perhaps something more complex and exotic.

Using a scanning tunneling microscope to examine materials is always a thrill. The striking patterns of bright and dark spots on the screen, representing atomic positions, never gets old. There’s something magical about seeing the atomic structure up close. It's like peering into a hidden world, where the fundamental building blocks of matter are laid bare in a visually captivating way.

As I set up my station, I couldn't help but wonder what unique properties this black crystal might reveal. The anticipation of its secrets was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking.

Just before finishing the sync between my computer and the microscope, I heard Helena excitedly call for me. “Sir! We’re lucky. No calibration was needed with the bias voltage. The image clarity is extremely high.”

I rushed over to see what she meant. That doesn’t make sense. This equipment usually requires hours of calibration for a single sample to even get a decent resolution of its lattice structure.

But she was right, and we were in shock and awe. Holy shit, it’s even more beautiful than I could possibly imagine. Somehow, the resolution was incredibly high. The microscope was revealing the secrets of the sample at an atomic level. I could see the atomic bonds right on the screen, beautiful bright spots depicting a highly exotic pattern, one that is not typically seen in nature.

It was showing the golden ratio fractal pattern. The intricate and mesmerizing design, repeating itself at every scale, was unlike anything I had ever seen in my years of research. The golden ratio, approximately 1.618, creates spirals and self-similar shapes that grow outward in perfect harmony.

The precision and clarity of the image were astounding, capturing the essence of the sample in a way that defied all expectations. Seeing this beautiful, natural pattern at an atomic level was like peering into the very fabric of the universe. It was a moment of pure awe and wonder, a reminder of why I fell in love with science in the first place.

My heart raced with excitement. This discovery could be groundbreaking. The golden ratio fractal pattern hinted at a level of complexity and order that could revolutionize our understanding of condensed matter physics. I felt a surge of pride and anticipation, knowing that we were on the brink of uncovering something truly extraordinary.

However, I did not want to get ahead of myself. “Helena and Brandon, can you rerun the scan again with a 2.5% increase in the bias voltage? I want to see if we get consistent images of the layer we are currently observing.”

After 30 minutes of waiting, we could see that the pattern the microscope visualized had changed completely. There were no signs of the previous pattern at all.

What we saw now was a high-resolution image of a perfect circle with a series of monoliths of different heights pointing outwards, their bases residing on that circle. The monoliths stood like silent sentinels, each one unique in height but perfectly aligned along the circumference. It was as if we were looking at an ancient, otherworldly city, meticulously crafted with a precision that defied natural explanation. The stark contrast between the dark monoliths and the bright circle was both eerie and mesmerizing, hinting at the profound mysteries this sample held.

This doesn’t occur in nature at all. This is all so wrong. “This can’t be right. Helena and Brandon, I need you to run the scan using the original bias voltage, before the 2.5% increase.”

Both technicians did it right away. But I could see the anxiety on their faces. They too cannot understand or even comprehend what they were seeing. 

The scan was complete, and I fell to the floor in shock. The image was completely different from what we saw the first time, or the second time. The microscope displayed an image of a bright obelisk surrounded by pure black. It was as if the atoms had rearranged themselves to send a message. I was dreadfully horrified by this.

The obelisk stood tall and solitary, its brilliance piercing through the darkness like a beacon. The stark contrast between the radiant structure and the void around it was unsettling, almost otherworldly. It felt as though the sample was alive, communicating in a language of shapes and patterns that defied natural laws.

My mind raced with questions and fears. How could this be possible? What kind of material could exhibit such bizarre and unpredictable behavior? The implications were terrifying. If the sample could alter its atomic arrangement so drastically, what else was it capable of?

I glanced at Helena and Brandon. Their faces were pale, eyes wide with a mix of confusion and fear. They too were grappling with the incomprehensible nature of what we were witnessing. The room felt colder, the air heavier with the weight of our collective dread.

“That’s it. We’re pulling the plug. This sample is exhibiting behavior that seems to be governed by some unnatural presence. This can be extremely dangerous for us.” Both Helena and Brandon seemed relieved after I gave this order. Dr. Campbell, on the other hand, though silent as if bound by some higher directive, seemed displeased and jotted down notes, probably to comment poorly on my decision.

Right away, I saw both Helena and Brandon working in haste to turn off the microscope. Brandon looked extremely puzzled, but Helena was silently rushing, as if her life depended on it.

“The microscope is not shutting off. We ran standard procedures. Even unplugged it. Somehow, it’s still being powered,” Brandon said to me, his voice tinged with panic.

My instinct kicked in. “Step back! Something is wrong. Someone inform security, this lab is compromised.”

Just as the technicians ran to my position near the lab entrance, an entity seemed to suddenly materialize out of thin air near the microscope. It looked vaguely human but was twisted and deformed. It had no limbs, yet it appeared to twist and writhe in ways I didn’t think were possible. It seemed to be huge, small, and tiny all at once, displaying a whole array of colors and shimmering in different ways simultaneously. But the face remained the same. It looked familiar.

The entity's face was a grotesque parody of a human visage, contorted in a perpetual expression of agony and rage. Its eyes, or what seemed to be eyes, glowed with an eerie light, piercing through the chaos of its form. The sight was both mesmerizing and horrifying, a nightmarish vision that defied all logic and reason.

I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized where I had seen that face before. It was the face of Dr. Aisha, my supervisor. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. What had happened to her? Was this some twisted manifestation of her? My mind raced with questions and fears, but there was no time to dwell on them.

“Everyone, get out of here now!” I shouted, my voice trembling with urgency. “We need to evacuate the lab immediately.”

As we scrambled to leave, the entity began to move towards us, its form shifting and distorting with every step. The air around it seemed to warp and bend, creating a surreal and terrifying spectacle. We had to get out before it reached us, before it could do whatever it intended to do.

Romero and Jack, our armed security, sprang into action the moment the entity appeared. They started shooting at it, their bullets seemingly passing through its twisted form without effect. The creature's movements became more erratic, its colors shifting violently as if reacting to the gunfire.

Dr. Campbell stood frozen in shock, unable to comprehend what he was seeing. He was the closest to the entity, and before he could react, it reached out with a tendril-like appendage. In an instant, Dr. Campbell was enveloped, his body mummified by the creature's touch. His face contorted in a silent scream, his eyes wide with terror.

“Fall back!” Romero shouted, his voice filled with desperation. “We need to get out of here, now!”

We continued to retreat, the entity advancing relentlessly. The lab, once a place of scientific discovery and safety, had become a nightmarish battleground. The sight of Dr. Campbell's lifeless form spurred us on, our fear driving us to escape the horror that had been unleashed.

A sudden realization struck me like a bolt of lightning. The microscope functioned through the quantum tunneling effect between its probe and the sample. What if, by using it, we had inadvertently opened a door between our world and the sample's? There was no time to ponder the implications, wild and unrealistic as they might seem. I had to trust my gut. We had to act fast.

"Romero! Jack! Shoot the microscope! Do it now before this whole facility is compromised!" I shouted, my voice edged with desperation.

To my surprise, they didn't hesitate. They turned and began firing at the microscope, but the device was small and difficult to hit. Bullets ricocheted off the lab equipment, missing their mark.

"Romero! Cover me! I'm going in!" Jack yelled over the chaos.

Romero nodded and sprinted in the opposite direction, drawing the entity's attention. "Hey, you freak! Over here! Come at me!" he taunted, his voice a mix of fear and defiance.

The entity's form twisted and writhed, its attention momentarily diverted by Romero's bold move. This gave Jack the opening he needed. He dashed towards the microscope, his movements precise and determined.

With the entity distracted, Jack reached the microscope and aimed his weapon at point-blank range. The sound of gunfire echoed through the lab as he unloaded his clip into the device. Sparks flew, and the microscope shattered into pieces.

As the last fragments of the microscope fell to the floor, the entity let out a guttural, otherworldly scream. Its form began to flicker and distort, as if it were being pulled back into another dimension. It moved towards Romero, but before it could reach him, it vanished into thin air, leaving behind an eerie silence.

We stood there, panting and shaken, the reality of what had just happened sinking in. The lab, once a sanctuary of scientific exploration, now felt like a battlefield scarred by an encounter with the unknown.

"Is everyone okay?" I asked, my voice trembling.

Romero and Jack nodded, their faces pale but resolute. "We did it," Jack said, his voice filled with a mix of relief and disbelief. "We actually did it."

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. "Let's get out of here and report this to Director Anya. We need to make sure this never happens again."

As we made our way out of the lab, I noticed that Helena and Brandon were nowhere to be found. They must have run out of the lab in the chaos without anyone realizing it. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was just the beginning. The mysteries of Sample 4622 were far from solved, and the horrors it could unleash were still lurking in the shadows.
