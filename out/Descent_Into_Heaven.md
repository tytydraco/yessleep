I know all of you mean well, but I'm getting really tired of being asked about my ascension. I tried to make it clear to you it was a painful subject, but that just seemed to goad you into persisting. I understand that spiritual transcendence sounds like a dream come true, that beholding the face of ultimate reality would give you some sort of inner peace. But it wasn't like that at all. So, although this disturbs me more than you can imagine, I'm finally giving in. I've written this to explain, once and for all, what happened, but after this, no more questions about it, ever, OK? I'm dead serious.

It happened while I was associated with the Free Deist Foundation. Don't take that as an endorsement; please don't flood into their temples, or hound their monks, demanding to learn the secrets of the universe. I was merely a loosely-affiliated customer when it happened, and I have no idea how much credit they can take. I'm a seeker, and I've belonged to many organizations in my life. I've even pursued my own path, based on what I felt in my heart. Was that the true source of my experience? Even I don't know.

But I remember how it started. It was a crisp Saturday morning, and as I had many times before, I found myself in the temple, one of many supplicants in the central hall, sitting upon scented pillows, meditating together. The monks kept censers of incense burning around the altar, acolytes fanning the smoke with palm fronds, sending it wafting over our heads. Some supplicants hummed, some chanted, but many, like me, preferred to sit in silence.

I don't even know what triggered it. I was just sitting there, reaching out to the universe in my mind, trying to contain any desire for particular results. I knew that letting my ego determine my path was a sure road to nowhere, and strove to keep it in check. Deep down inside, though, I could never help feeling that I demonstrated my superiority and worthiness by choosing to pursue this path, as opposed to the degraded, mundane reality of everyday life—the endless pursuit of pleasure, the mind-numbing pop culture, the low-brow distractions. I felt they were beneath me. My meditation wasn't just a practice; it was a defiant act, a righteous path to defy the squalor of existence. I admit I may have cultivated a quiet ego about my spiritual worthiness. I'm not saying this to elevate myself, or to judge anyone—I'm just putting it out there, so that you understand where I was really coming from.

As far as I know, I was doing what I always did; there was nothing special about that day. But the first change I noticed was that the ambient noise became quieter, its volume gently and smoothly ramping down, as if it, or I, were somehow far away. I tried my best not to react to it; it seemed to be a good sign, that I was finally tuning out the outside world, a positive development in my practice of meditation. Then, without any warning, I felt a shift. Not a gentle awakening, but a jarring, almost violent displacement. The temple, the sounds, the very air, dissipated. It wasn't at all what I expected ascension to feel like.

I suddenly found myself somewhere else. To my great dismay, it wasn't a brightly-lit cloud bank, or a liminal space where God gazed upon us beatifically. It was a crowded plaza, the sky a sickly shade of greenish-brown. I found myself beset from all sides by a vast, bustling, indifferent crowd. The air here wasn't ethereal; it was stale, a little stuffy, smelling faintly of ozone and old dust. Before me, in the distance, shimmering brilliantly, stood a golden gate. It was exactly as Heaven's entrance had been described in countless paintings and innumerable near-death experiences. The crowd slowly shuffled forward, drawn inexorably toward it. There didn't seem to be much choice but to go along with them, so I let the multitude gently sweep me forward.

I had plenty of time to look around me; the crowd was a bewildering mix. As expected, there were hunched old people who appeared to have ambled out of their deathbeds; their heads turned to and fro to survey the crowd, many wearing the same blank, uneasy expression. Some were unnaturally thin, little more than walking skeletons; they tended to flop their poorly-supported upper body onto whomever was nearby. This earned them indignant glares, but little else; it seemed clear they couldn't help it. Others were morbidly obese, standing on their own for the first time in years, no need for the expected aluminum-frame walker with the shoe-like tennis balls impaled on its front legs. The crushing density of the crowd let them move forward on their own, at the slow pace they were accustomed to.

Many were weary middle-aged folks marked by chronic illness; more than anyone else there, they seemed at peace, content to shuffle along with the others. A few of them blinked in the unaccustomed light; although their eyes showed the blank sclera of diabetes-induced blindness, they could apparently see again, but appeared too surprised to enjoy it. One fellow I will never forget—all that was left of his face was a single eyeball. At least half of his head was missing, the void reaching nearly to the back of his skull, his throat sewn up save for two small holes, possibly for breathing and eating. I'd heard of severe head-cancer cases like this, but had never seen one. He appeared none the worse for wear, though, his animated movements telegraphing his joy and relief.

Some were agitated young people, clearly having arrived via sudden, violent ends from accidents or risky exploits. They gave themselves away with their horrified expressions and futile pleas for another chance; finally, they would sink into sullen silence and join the others, only moving when someone pushed them from behind. A few held their severed limbs with their remaining good arm, unsure of what else to do with them. Others struggled to remove wooden beams or steel spikes from their torsos, some garnering help from those nearby, only to be forced to carry their instruments of impalement, there being nowhere else to put them. One held onto her head with both hands, the blood on her shoulders giving away her injury; occasionally, she would hold her head high to get a better look around, but would quickly lower it back onto the bloody stump of her neck, plainly uncomfortable with this new ability.

I couldn't be sure I saw anyone that looked like me. There were a few flowing robes here and there, but I wasn't certain they were seekers; that might have just been their fashion. The thick crowd made it impossible to do much but trudge toward the golden gates. I did notice some new arrivals materialized in the middle of the throng, startling their new neighbors. I'm not sure if my arrival was met with any protests; I had been too startled for much in the way of self-awareness.

I felt a shove from my left side; a new supplicant had arrived. A slicing pain erupted in my torso; I could feel the cold steel digging into my flesh. I turned to frown at this effrontery, and immediately my words turned to stone in my throat. Standing beside me was some sort of Gothic priestess, her black, spiderweblike robes barely concealing the details of her voluptuous body. Her exposed skin was just as pale as her inadequately obscured flesh. Her wide, haunting eyes, exquisitely decorated with black makeup, were enough to send chills down my spine, but I was immediately distracted by the thrush of metal blades protruding from her hairless head, poking through her shroud. Quickly, I realized the rest of her body was covered with the same sort of blades, though they were folded down, hugging her skin. One had apparently protruded enough to slice a gash in my side.

"Devil's Delight!" she crowed. "By my will, and through the power granted by the infinite darkness, I have transcended the misbegotten world, and arrived here!" Her wild grin punctuated the feverish look in her eyes; I could not find the strength, nor the fortitude, to look away. Her presence alone curdled the air.

Her expression softened, and she peered at me with firm dispassion, as a snake might when sizing up its next meal. "I'm Thelema," she declared. "And who might you be?"

"I—um...Julian," I offered meekly.

Her face twisted into mockery. "Then I'm Norma, though no one calls me that anymore." She looked me up and down with obvious disapproval. "You really go by your birth name?" She threw her head back and cackled. "It takes all kinds, I guess."

She transfixed me with a bewildered gaze. "You really did it the hard way? Clean living, aesthetic lifestyle, endless meditation, that sort of thing?"

"Well, I...yes."

She cackled again. "Then I have to commend your effort! I never had the patience for any of that. I only worked hard at finding shortcuts."

Dreading her response, I asked anyway. "So how did *you* do it?"

She shrugged. "I'm a seeker. A little black magic here, a little witchcraft there...but lately, I've been more about ritual magic." Coyly, she swept her eyes over her curvaceous form. "Mostly sex magick. You ever try that?"

"No!" I retorted. "My current path is celibate."

She shook her head gently as a deep-throated chortling slowly grew in volume. "Oh, you poor deluded fool. Life is for living! The universe offers us many pleasures! It doesn't want us to forego its bounty! It wants us to be happy!" She clucked her tongue as she beheld my simple brown robe. "You were really living life on hard mode, weren't you. Granted, your soul is less stained than mine, but what does it matter if we end up in the same place?"

I strained to keep my anger in check. "I can't believe someone like you is allowed into Heaven."

"Not only allowed, but welcomed!" she gushed, flinging her arms upward, the only place where there was any freedom of movement. "You've heard the saying, right? There are many paths, but only one destination!"

I pinched my eyes closed and tried to ignore my surroundings. I had learned to tune out the real world during meditation, and I tried desperately to do it here. The crushing horde, their varying but uniformly awful smells, and the caterwauling of the recently deceased made it impossible. I opened my eyes to see Thelema still standing next to me, her eyes wide with gleeful insanity.

"So what was your trigger?" I asked. "What finally let you ascend?"

"Nothing I haven't done many times before," she replied. "Just the latest virgin male, and the usual profane ritual." She fixed me with an arresting glare. "Do you know how difficult it is to find virgins these days? I finally had to resort to unemployable shutins. You wouldn't believe how much time I had to spend trawling through anonymous imageboards, looking for gullible chumps. I've sent out so many nudes, I sometimes feel like a whore. But it paid off in the end!"

I could feel this conversation tarnishing my soul, but she continued. "So there I was, with my latest patsy, bouncing rhythmically on top of him. He had a really big schlong, this one. And we had one of the biggest simultaneous orgasms I remember having." She cocked her head to one side. "Maybe that was it. Most of them come too fast and then try to lie about it." A wicked grin spread across her face. "Finally, it was all worth it! Here I am!"

I stared ahead glumly, lost for a response. "What's wrong?" she asked. "You made it too, didn't you?"

"I can't believe Heaven rewards people like you," I growled. "You're the opposite of everything I consider to be enlightenment."

"I told you!" she cheered. "Life is to be lived! The universe wants you to be happy! Not all bottled up inside, denying your nature. There was never any reason to be so hard on yourself!"

"I guess I don't understand the nature of Heaven," I finally had to conclude. I noticed the golden gates had grown closer, and felt grateful that this ordeal was coming to an end soon.

I felt myself shoved brutally from behind, followed by a feral roar. Closing my eyes and cowered, I dreaded whatever came next, surprised to hear it was several female voices bellowing similarly. As that settled down, someone shouted into my ear. "Move aside, peasant!"

I opened my eyes to see Thelema staring behind me, her eyes wide with wonder, her face filled with delight. I turned around to see a barrel-shaped chest covered in animal skins. I craned my neck upward to perceive the head perched atop those shoulders; his ferocious glare put Thelema's to shame. In a day filled with horrors and depredations, this was more than I could stand.

"I said, move aside! The New Lord of Darkness demands it!" His chest swelled another size; menace seemed to pour from under his barbarian clothing.

"I can't!" I shot back. "None of us can move!"

"Oh, you'll move," he snapped. "All of you will."

I noticed his hand held the ends of several rusted chains. Tracing them back, I was startled to see they were all connected to a coterie of emaciated, shivering women, standing behind him. Each wore clothes shred to nearly nothing; underneath, their skin rippled with welts, bruises, and bloody wounds. The chains attached to spiked collars around their necks, but the spikes were on the inside, digging into their flesh. The looks on their faces bewildered me; they all looked clearly broken and traumatized, but each had an incongruous grin, the happiness of their smile clashing with the fright on their faces and the terror in their eyes.

"What in blazes did you do to them?" I challenged, finally finding my voice.

"Exactly what I promised!" he thundered. "They knew the path was filled with torment and pain! They entered this covenant willingly! And I delivered!"

"Yeah!" one of the women shouted, her voice gurgling. "Here we are, in front of Heaven!"

"Leave him alone!" shouted another. "He kept his word! Finally, it's all worth it!"

He leaned toward me; his face was only inches from mine. A foul odor poured from his mouth; some of it may have come from sour blood, but most of it was indescribable. Gagging involuntarily, I tried to pull back.  "And now," he stated simply, "stand aside."

He pushed my shoulder; to my surprise, I stumbled to the side. Looking around, I realized that the crowd had somehow parted in front of me. Grinning smugly, he stomped forward, giving the chains a jerk. His women stumbled, then followed him. One fell to the ground; she cried out in pain. He turned around, his eyes furious, and yanked her chain. "On your feet, hag!" She shrieked pitifully as she struggled to find her footing. He marched on, oblivious to her pain. "Make way for the New Lord of Darkness!" he roared, slipping through the narrow passage that had formed in the multitude. As the crowd cheered him, he and his entourage passed through, the path closing up behind them.

"Wow!" Thelema exulted. "Can you believe that?"

"Not for a moment," I mumbled. So many of my assumptions about the nature of God and the universe crumbled as I pondered them helplessly.

"The audacity of his path!" she gushed. "Torture! Blood magick! You have to admire the bravery!"

"Do I," I muttered.

Thelema peered at me again. This time, it felt like genuine sympathy, which I found unsettling. "Don't take it so hard!" she advised. "You made it here as much as he did, after all! There may be many paths, but the destination is the same!"

I couldn't wrap my mind around what I had just witnessed. The Gnostics taught that God was completely indifferent to our plight, but never had the evidence been cast into such sharp relief. There had to be an answer for all of this, and I hoped it was through those golden gates.

"If it's all the same to you," I said, turning to Thelema, "I'd rather just focus on getting through those gates and finding out what Heaven is like."

Thelema looked wistful. "Suit yourself," she replied. "Though I was hoping to see you on the other side. I was looking forward to exploring this new territory with you."

I frowned as I looked her up and down. "I don't think you're my type."

"And what type would that be?" she shot back. "Beautiful? Willing? Spiritually centered? I think we have a lot in common."

"Maybe someone that didn't look like an unfolded Swiss Army knife," I groused.

She sighed huffily. "I thought you were different," she snapped. "But you're like all the rest. You can't even see past the surface."

I turned away from her angrily, focusing my gaze on the golden gates, which grew ever closer. Soon, I told myself, this ordeal would be over.

Something shoved my right side; that was quickly followed by fervent gurgling and repeated rounds of vomiting. After everything else that had happened today, it seemed like the least of my worries. Following a round of violent coughing, my ears were suddenly blasted by a high-pitched caterwauling. I redoubled my efforts to ignore what was going on around me.

"Mommy!" the high-pitched voice screeched. "I want my mommy!"

I turned to look; next to me stood a little girl, her clothes drenched, the braids in her strawberry-blonde hair unraveling. She shivered uncontrollably.

"What happened to you?" I asked her, unable to maintain my detachment.

The little girl's face turned glum. "Mommy said she was going to make everything better," she related. "Then she drove off the bridge and into the water." The little girl looked around frantically. "Where is she? She could be hurt!"

I pinched my eyes closed and tried to keep my composure. "Everything *is* better now, honey," I heard Thelema say. "You're going to Heaven."

The little girl sniffed; I opened my eyes to see her stare, unblinking. "What about my baby brother? Is he OK?"

"He already in Heaven, dear," Thelema assured. "Babies go straight to Heaven."

A small relieved smile cracked over the little girl's face. "And what about my mommy?"

Thelema didn't answer. I turned my head and looked down. "If your mom deliberately drove you all off a bridge, then she's definitely not going to Heaven."

The little girl's eyes grew wide with horror; a gurgling cry turned into a sustained scream. "Mommy!" she wailed.

"Why did you have to tell her that?" Thelema growled.

"What was I supposed to say?" I countered. "It's the truth!"

"No, it's *your* truth," Thelema snarled. "And not a very nice one." The little girl continued to bawl. Thelema's indignant glare bored into me like twin jets of fire. "Haven't you figured out just how little you understand about the nature of the universe?"

I started to speak, but my throat choked up on the words. The little girl was now beating on me futilely with her tiny fists, screaming "No! No! No!" over and over. I turned to look at Thelema, but she was staring at the gates of Heaven, a sour expression on her face. I exhaled sharply and resumed staring in that direction. Soon, all this would be over.

Finally, I passed through the golden gates. From underneath, I realized with a start that they weren't golden at all. They may have shone in the sunlight, but not only were they painted white, but the gloss had worn away over time, leaving dull streaks and patches. The only golden color came from the sunlight and the unearthly shade of the sky. I sighed heavily and continued to shuffle forward. Soon I noticed ropes suspended on metallic stanchions; I hadn't noticed when those had started. They guided me along a path that finally terminated in a row of simply-constructed tables, cheap-looking chairs strewn along their length.

I sat in the first empty one I found, meeting the weary glare of the first angel I had ever laid eyes on. Far from filling me with awe, he looked like a cynical civil servant, complete with an ill-fitting, slightly glowing robe. Sweeping my eyes along the tables, I noticed the other angels looked similar. Thelema sat in the chair next to mine, her eyes shooting me an icy, disapproving glare. The angel assigned to me shuffled papers that seem to be made of pure light, but on closer inspection, looked like endless spreadsheets. His simple nametag read "Peter".

"Wow!" I exulted. "Are you the Saint Peter of legend?"

His heavy-lidded eyes glared at me. "Of course not," he answered. "There are a lot of Peters in Heaven. Just like where you came from." He peered closely at his papers. "Earth. Ugh. My condolences."

I heard sniffling to my right. Next to me sat the little girl; her angel reached across the table to hold her hand. "Don't be afraid, young one," she cooed. "Your pain is over."

"Where's my mommy?" she simpered.

"She'll be along soon enough," the angel declared. "Until then, you can wait inside with your baby brother."

She looked up with a start. "He's OK?"

"He's fine!" the angel assured her. "And he really wants to see you." The little girl looked back eagerly, a broad smile on her face.

The angel took a shining necklace and put it over the little girl's head. In an instant, golden light flowed over her, repairing her torn clothing, healing all her wounds, and grooming her to perfection. The little girls' face beamed with beatific joy. "You may enter," the angel explained. "Follow the Light. You'll know where to go."

Without another word, the little girl stood up and walked away, quickly disappearing from sight.

"I can't find your name here," Peter announced. "Were you expected?"

"What do you mean, expected?" I replied. "I've been meditating for years, and finally, I ascended."

Peter gave me a disapproving glare. "A volunteer, huh? Almost as bad as a suicide."

"What do you mean?" I asked, taken aback.

"Are you at least part of an organized group?" he asked.

"Not really a member, no," I explained. "I pay to meditate in their central hall, but I've never formally joined. They've asked me to, but I kept turning them down."

Peter shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose with his fingers. "Then you have a lot of paperwork to fill out for your visa application."

"Visa?" I asked quietly.

I looked down to see a thick stack of forms laying on the table in front of me; I wasn't sure how long they had been there. Peter pushed them closer to me. "You can take these down to the study hall and fill them out. When you're done, come back. We need to keep this line moving."

"The dead have to fill out forms to go to Heaven?" I guffawed incredulously.

"No!" Peter snapped. "Only the ascended. If you come here before your time, there's a lot of paperwork involved. Normally, churches do that on your behalf. Did you think organized religion exists for no good reason?"

My mouth hung open; I was unable to form a reply. "Wow, you really are the worst," I heard Thelema say. She was glaring at me as if she had found me stuck to the bottom of her shoe. "You had *no* idea what you were getting into at all."

"*You* belong to an organized group?" I scoffed.

"Of course!" she snapped. "The Necromantic Cotillion! You think I stuck all these blades into myself?" She swept her hands over her form. "This takes teamwork!"

"Wow, you know literally nothing," Peter snarled. Another form appeared on top of my stack. "Here's a simplified checklist, to help you ease into these forms."

I quickly scanned over the checklist. "It says here I have to pick a profession?"

"Well, of course you do!" Peter retorted, throwing his hands up in the air. "Do you think I volunteered for this *exalted* task of having to deal with you? Look at me! This could be *your* future!" He leaned over slightly and looked me in the eye. "If Heaven was better than being alive, people would be committing suicide left and right to get here. Then where would that leave us?"

I picked up the checklist and looked at them closely, mostly to shield myself from Peter's penetrating glare. "I always thought I'd want to be a Bodhisattva."

"Ha!" Thelema interjected. She was now wearing a shiny necklace, and bathed in a golden glow; all the metalwork impaled in her skin was gone. With her health restored, she looked more beautiful than ever. Gone was the serpentine look in her eyes; they now radiated pure warmth, pure love. I felt a lump rise in my throat.

"What happened to all your piercings?" I asked.

"They're gone, obviously!" she retorted. "It's called penance. Are you telling me you've never heard of proscribing pain for religious purposes?"

"I always felt that was so unnecessary and brutal," I opined.

She stood up and started to walk away. "Just one more thing you're wrong about." She slapped the back of my head as she passed by, causing my upper body to lurch forward. "I can't believe I was ever attracted to you." She quickly blended in with the crowd and vanished.

I stared after her hotly for a moment, then turned back. Peter was unsuccessfully trying to stifle his laughter. He lowered his hand and smirked at me.

"What was *that* all about?" I growled.

"Didn't you know?" Peter asked. "Bodhisattva is one of the worst jobs there is. You have to descend back to the lower realms to be a teacher, or messiah, though that usually ends with being burned alive for heresy, or nailed to a cross, or some other awful fate."

I resumed reading the checklist. "What other sorts of jobs are there?"

Peter snickered. "We won't know until you fill out the forms. But based on what I've seen so far, you're likely to end up on welfare, in a high-density housing project."

A chill shot down my spine. "That sounds like Hell."

"That *is* Hell!" Peter revealed. "Hell Towers is the largest housing development we have. Block after block of skyscraper apartment buildings, each one more brutalist than the last."

A wave of ennui washed over me; my hand fell limply to the table, taking the checklist with it. "This isn't at all what I expected."

"So?" Peter shot back. "Who died and made *you* princess?"

I noticed the two angels sitting near Peter were staring at me and laughing. "We're all dealing with this terrible Creation in the best way we know how!" Peter continued. "You don't have all the answers, and neither do we!"

I closed my eyes as I felt tears well up inside me. In many ways, Heaven was worse than the place I left. "I think I'd prefer to go back."

Peter snorted derisively. "*Now* he gets it."

The air suddenly changed around me. My eyes shot open; I was back in the temple, sitting on my cushion. I found myself surrounded by the other acolytes, staring at me expectantly, wide grins on all their faces. "You ascended!" one exulted. The crowd cheered loudly.

"How did you know?" I asked as the applause died down.

"Because you stopped moving!" another revealed. "And you were giving off a golden light the whole time!"

I averted my eyes; the tears I had been fighting started to flow. "What's wrong?" one asked. "You didn't go to Hell, did you?"

"I don't know," I answered. "I didn't get that far. I think it was some sort of Purgatory."

The acolytes exchanged worried looks. "What are you talking about?"

"Ascension isn't what you think it is," I revealed. "Don't bother trying. It's just big crowds and a lot of waiting."

I got up to leave; they stared after me with puzzled expressions. I turned back once before exiting the central hall. "And the forms are incomprehensible."

That was the last time I ever stepped foot in the temple, and I don't plan to go back, to there or any other church. I've been preparing most of my life to reach the other side, and found it more terrifying than I can comprehend. And now, I don't know what to do with myself. Should I party until I'm broke? Should I stick myself with pins and needles? Should I join the military and die heroically? Hermeticism has long declared "as above, so below". Only now do I realize the full horror behind that statement.

I hope this answers everyone's questions about my ascension. Now you know the brutal truth—that it was nothing worth striving for. And hopefully you understand why I'm now dedicated to living the longest life I can—because, this world, as awful as it is, is far better than [the](https://reddit.com/r/CthulhusPlayground/new) [alternative](https://redd.it/10uandh).
