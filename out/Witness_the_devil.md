"No matter how you look at it, we've lost. He won." He, the young boy I met about week ago, has proclaimed with this statement (that has a deeper meaning the more you look at it ) that the loss is, was and forever will be innevitable as long as you fight with the unknown. The unknown moving force that creates and takes life. The nature, the universe, the God and the devil. 
"No that can't be true" I said with a sadness in my voice. What he didn't know yet, was my secret plan and I like it to stay it that way, in that moment. 
We both were standing before the burning house and we both tried to remember how it all began. 

For me it was way before I met this guy. "Met" is probably a strong word, he was the one who came to me. One rainy day the door in the caffeteria where I was working opened and there in a rainy coat stood a this boy not older than 25. When he approached and told me he has answers I'm trying to find so desperately and he has answer to life, I laughed. "Of course" I said and I would swear he's on trip, I continued and asked him what he want without any interest. 
"To change your life" 
It all began for me when I was 5 and saw the fire in the sky. Then at age 7 the ghosts and so on. 
"To change my life? How?" 
He put his hand into one of his pockets, cold sweat went through my body and fear prepared me for worst if he put out weapon I was ready to fight for my life, it was picture. Picture of symbol I  had been seeing for years. Then I remembered, all those looks from an unknown guys on the streets, the sound of door opening and someone walking at night in my solitary apartment, how could I forget. 

He explained it is like this for some of us. No one knows why. Yet. Not even he. If you ask me I don't trust him even now, but I will follow him to my death. He showed me something many people will never even think of. 

Since that rainy day in an empty caffeteria passed many days, many days of terror. Everyday we were witnessing the most hideous, strange possibillities of this world. To name some : men and women rushing at us in sacred forest on arms instead of legs screaming outragesly, small kids speaking in ancient languages in an inhuman way, spontaneous human combustions and nightmares of tortures and deaths one can think of.

When we survived this, he came. One night, all the street lamps on street in front of my house shut off. I believe to this day I heard choir singing. It creates shadow in the dark. It looked like man. Black hat hiding it's face, black leather coat hiding it's body, with gloves of the same material. It stood outside and speak directly to our minds. "Give up." That was all, it was so loud and left a ringing in our heads and we fainted and woke up the next morning. We didn't. We didn't gave up. 

Deal was broken. All relatives dead. House burnt to the ground. But we witnessed it. My friend is dead now but my secret plan worked although I remember it only once in 666 days and I'm forever locked in an asylum.
