100,000 annual deaths. In the modern day, a number like that feels so impersonal, so easy to ignore. It may even sound small to some.

100,000 lives ended before their time. Each one represents a face, a personality, a family. 

When I say these things, I can't help but wonder what might go through someone's head. Do I mean some type of disease? Some war?

I'm talking about commercial fishing. Commercial fishing takes approximately 100,000 lives worldwide every year. 

That puts it on par with liver cancer globally and drug overdoses in the United States.

The sea is an unforgiving place to us who don’t belong there.

Storms sweep in from out of nowhere - winds that feel like they’ll pluck you off your ship and through you overboard into that inky black water. The waves themselves are like hands, trying to rip you from the deck and drown you.

The equipment itself is dangerous. People get caught in nets, winches or lines. Or simply getting crushed by heavy machinery. 

Add on 20 hour shifts and being hundreds of miles away from any type of medical help, and the numbers start to seem more realistic. 

There’s a million ways it can happen. And I’ve thought about most of them. What they’d feel like. How long it would take to be over. 

I thought I was at peace with it- the risk of dying like that. My entire family is one of fisherman, and I wouldn’t be the first to go out that way.

Every fisherman knows he’s rolling dice with the sea. Some think their number won’t come up, but I always thought mine would. I just didn’t think it would come up like this

I was okay with it. I loved the sea, and everyone dies one day. I was okay with dying in a way I knew. That I understood. 

So why does the way I’m going to die have to be so incomprehensible to me? Why does the fate I’ve been given - the fate looking me in the eyes as I type this - need to be terrifying beyond my worst nightmares? Why couldn’t I just have sunk? Why couldn’t I have drowned or died of hypothermia? I’d even take the machinery over this.

Tonight started with a struggle. The winds were rougher than usual. The waves crashed against the trawler hard enough to make me feel like I was captaining a toy boat in an unruly child’s pool.

It isn't a very large boat. Including myself, there are only 6 of us. Were, rather. 

I’m the senior deckhand. Not an official position title, I’ve just been doing it the longest. 

It was business as usual, we were casting our lines into the raging sea. 

The deck pitched and groaned under our boots as we fought to work the nets. Salt spray lashed our faces, and every other second the bow slammed down into the trough of a wave with enough force to make my teeth rattle.

I shouted at the greenhorn to keep the line clear, but my voice was swallowed by the howling wind. He scrambled to untangle the net before the winch pulled it taut and dragged him straight to the rollers. 

The sea doesn’t care how careful you are. A loose loop of rope can tighten like a noose around your leg in an instant. One second you’re on deck, the next you’re yanked overboard and gone.

The winch shrieked as it strained, hauling up a heavy, sodden mess from the black water. The nets whipped and swung like a battering ram, each swell threatening to slam them into the railings - or one of us. The men braced and cursed, their rain-gear slick with seawater, their hands raw from the fight.

We worked like that for what felt like hours, each of us soaked through, every muscle screaming. And still the storm raged, waves hammering us until I wondered how long the trawler could endure it.

That was when I saw Anders - the veteran of the crew, a man who had thirty years at sea behind him - lose his footing. He hit the slick deck hard, slid toward the edge, and before anyone could grab him, a wave came roaring across the bow. 

He should’ve been fine. I swear I checked his safety line. Yet through the thick droplets of rain I could see - he was completely untethered.

He should’ve been fine. Cold and wet from the wave, sure, but fine.

Instead, he vanished over the side as if the ocean had claimed him deliberately.

We ran to the rail, calling his name, but there was nothing. Only boiling black water, lit in flashes by the running lights.

For a long moment, nobody spoke. We all knew. Once the sea takes someone in weather like this, they don’t come back.

Then the greenhorn turned to me, his face pale under the spray. “Why wasn’t he clipped in?”

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. I *had* clipped him. I was sure of it. Weren’t I?

The captain’s eyes lingered on me a moment longer than I could stand before he looked away. “Back to your posts,” he barked, though his voice cracked with something that wasn’t command.

We stumbled back into place. But I could feel the eyes of the others linger on me. It was my fault. 

And then, just as suddenly as it had risen, the storm died.

Not eased. Not drifted away like storms normally do. One heartbeat the wind was screaming in my ears, the next there was nothing. The ocean flattened out beneath us like a sheet of dull, grey glass. Even the trawler seemed confused - the hull groaned as if it didn’t know how to float without being battered.

I don’t mean the sea became calm. It was more than that. There wasn’t a single ripple. The air was stagnant like old pond water. The only movement was the ship, chugging steadily forward in its course. 

It was as if time itself had stopped to hold its breath. 

One of the crew broke the silence. 

“Captain?” 

His voice cracked, thin in the stillness.

We all turned toward the old man, waiting for reassurance, for some kind of explanation. But the look in his eyes told us the truth; he was just as lost as we were.

The ship stopped so suddenly that it sent me to the ground. It was like a car hitting a brick wall. 

I got to my feet and looked over the sides of the boat, 2 of my peers following suit. 

“A reef?” The greenhorn asked. 

I answered him, 

“Not likely. We’re in deep waters.”

It took a moment for me to spot them, they were partly underwater. 

4 distinct shapes clung to the underside of the boat. Grey and wrinkled, with shell-like ridges across them.

Fingertips. 

Impossibly large, yet unmistakable. The boat was being held in place from underneath.

My throat tightened. “W…what is that?” I whispered, though no answer came.

The trawler jolted violently to port, throwing us into the rail. Then it swung back to starboard just as suddenly. The whole vessel groaned in protest as we were whipped side to side, sudden, jerking motions, like a child thrashing a toy.

We panicked. The captain called for the lifeboats and we complied to the best of our ability, trying to move through what felt like a category 10 earthquake towards our slim chance at salvation.

The creaking intensified, and we felt a new direction of pull.

Down.

The entire vessel was being pulled under, and not slowly either. 

We scrambled desperately for the life boat. The greenhorn made it, then the mechanic, then the other 2 deckhands. I was last.

I still hear the splash of the oars in my head, frantic, uneven, as if they couldn’t get away fast enough.

But the shaking, the thrashing, was so violent. The winch broke loose from its restraints and swung at my head. 

A blur of rusted steel, a crack like thunder in my skull, and then nothing.

The last I remember was seeing white, and then black. 

I was shocked to wake up at all, least of all on the same boat. It hadn’t sunk, but the crew was nowhere to be seen. Neither was the lifeboat. 

I don't blame them for leaving me. They probably thought I was already dead. And even if I wasn't, the time it would've taken them to drag me on board would've been more than they could afford. And I’m sure the blame for Anders was fresh in their hearts.

The thrashing had stopped. Everything was still again.

I took note of how calm the ocean had become. It was smooth as glass. Not a ripple to disturb the murky grey water. 

I've never seen it like that before today.

The boat drifted, but I swear the water beneath us wasn’t empty. The glassy surface bulged now and then, like something huge shifting far below.

I tried the engine. It works but the boat refuses to move. The prop churned, but the boat stayed still.

I tried the radio. It works too, but I can’t get any response. Only the static that hissed back at me.

I’ve never felt so alone. I almost wished the winch had killed me. At least then I wouldn’t be the only one left to hear it.

I’ve tried everything I could think of to get home, but nothing’s worked. Eventually I just took the last beer from inside and sat down on the deck, watching the sun go down on a glass sea. 

I thought about my life. My childhood growing up in Maine. Summers chasing fireflies in the backyard, pockets full of sea glass from afternoons on the shore. Autumn meant apples so crisp they snapped in your teeth, and leaves that set the hills on fire. Winters were brutal, sure, but they came with snow forts taller than I was, skates scratching across the frozen pond, and hot cocoa waiting at home. Long Springs when the rivers rushed and the first green broke through.

It was bitter sweet, remembering such happy things at a time like this.

I finished the last of my beer, savoring it as the now lukewarm liquid rushed down my throat.

The sun had been down for a while now.

I turned around towards the back of the ship only to freeze in place. My blood ran cold and I blinked, desperately trying to wake from whatever nightmare I was trapped in. 

It was sitting in the ocean like how a child sits in a bathtub - legs pulled into its chest, arms wrapped around them. Its eyes were bright green, and wide like trashcan lids. They peaked at me from behind its pale, almost translucent skin. I could see veins like blackish purple roots snaking through its body. 

It looked thin for its size. 

But judging from what I could see of it above the waters, it was easily larger than my boat. Large enough to flip it over like a toy. 

A starving giant. 

It's been hours now. Hours of an unending staring match with death. 

I’ve written this in the hopes that someone will find it. So I can tell people about what’s out here. Wherever I am, it isn’t a place meant for us. 

A few minutes ago it opened its mouth, and it hasn’t shut since. I can see shattered blanks lodged between its teeth, jutting out from its pallid gums. And other things too: chunks of what look like meat. And clothes. Clothes that I can recognize. 

I’m afraid to turn my back on it. But this crushing fear - this mountain of anxious waiting - it’s more than I can bear.

If this is how I go, then I’ll keep what dignity I can.

My plan was to confront it, the same way I once stepped into the sea as a boy, not knowing how deep it ran.

But before I could take a step, the water began to bulge again. Not once, but in dozens of places, all around the boat. The glassy sea cracked open like thin ice, swelling and breaking as shapes moved beneath.

It was never just one.

If someone finds this, don’t come looking. 

I’ve no hope left, only this warning: don’t follow. 

The ocean isn’t empty. It’s a lid. 

And the things below aren’t always sleeping.
