Hey I'm Josh I hope you all understand this story I'm not going to use my friends' real names, for the sake of them and their families, this is about the tragic story of mine and my friend's experience, let's start from the beginning...

**1989, July 6**

"Josh we're going to be late hurry up man", My friend Alex shouted "Right, give me a minute Alex I'm still packing my things" I replied "Well don't take too long man, Jennie is going to be there, you know you love her\~" Alex teases "Piss off man, I'm ready let's go to the campsite."  
"Alright Alright let's hit the road."

I'm going to skip the details of the six-hour drive and get straight to the part of me and Alex getting to the campsite. There were 6 people there with us 2 of which (besides Alex) I did know. It's not like I didn't know them at all it was more that they were not close like me, Alex, and Jennie.

"Hey, Josh!" Jennie shouted. She ran up and gave me a hug I blushed a little bit, and I hugged her back. "Hey Jennie it's been a while." "Yeah 2 whole weeks," she said with a sarcastic tone.  
I laughed "Right maybe it hasn't been that long... Missed you a ton though."  
"Really?" she replied. "Yeah, you're a great friend!" "Oh, thanks." She said with a slightly disappointed tone.

alright at this point I should add I had a huge crush on Jennie I know it will become more obvious as the story continues. Just wanted to point it out before it became corny or weird

Alex wrapped his arm around me and said in a teasing tone "Don't talk to my boyfriend like that" he said gayish way. "Fuck off Alex don't act like a fa3got" I slapped his arm away  
"Come on man don't be like that I'm only kidding" "I know I know but you know how I feel about the gays" "Yeah I know my bad" Alex apologized

We all go to the campsite and begin to set up camp, we all joked and fucked around while doing so about 30 minutes later we finished and sat around a fire smoking weed and drinking beer

"So Alex why did you invite us all here what's the point of the trip?" Jennie's friend Rebecca asks. Alex grins "You all remember the teenagers that died here all those years ago?" "Yeah, what about it?" I ask "Well we are here to figure out what happened to them all that time ago"  
"That's stupid whatever killed them is sure to be dead as well." Alex's grin fades "Come on man don't be a buzz kill." "Alright, fine so what are we going to do then" "Get high and wasted next thing in the morning we're going to find the beast that killed those kids." Alex cheers.  
"I don't have a problem with that," Jennie says "Me either," says Rebecca,

and for the next hour and a half all we did was smoke weed and drink beer and whisky  
we all woke up hungover as hell and we spent 5 hours of the morning throwing up and taking Advil. After we all felt better we went on a hike to the campsite the boys were at when they were killed.  
"Here we are, get to searching around" "Uhm searching for what?" I ask "Anything that can point to what the beast was." Alex said.  
"Alex think about this it's been 20 years, and this thing should be dead," I say "Still we can find something to lead to Justin's and John's bodies," Alex said "I suppose you're right" I reply

Me and Jennie go around searching the campsite "Jennie?" I ask "Yeah?" "where did they say the old car park was?" "over there" she pointed, I walked over and looked around. "They said the car was nowhere to be found right?" I ask "Yeah" I continued walking down this path until me and Jennie found this big cave. "Think something is in there?" she asked "I don't know let's find out go get Alex and the others"

she comes back with everyone Alex is laughing telling me well done on finding something that could point to the beast he grabs a flashlight and leads us into the cave...

As we walked into the cave we were shrouded in darkness it was almost suffocating  
we continued to follow Alex when he stopped.

"Hey Josh you see that?" Alex asked me, I looked where his flashlight was pointed and I saw some reddish marks on the ground. "It's probably nothing Alex." "What if it's dried blood."   
"You're thinking too much into it, just keep walking." 

we kept walking until Alex stopped dead in his tracks I bumped into him. 

"What the hell?" Alex mumbles "What is it?" Jennie asks "Just look," Alex said while pointing   
"Oh my god are those bones?" Rebecca asks "No shit," Alex says. "Well we found the missing kids," I say with a grim smile "We should head back to camp," Alex suggests "Alright let's go" I reply 

on the way back no one spoke besides Alex I just walked next to Jennie smoking my cigarette  
when we left the cave we noticed it was getting dark.  
   
"what the hell? we were in there for not even 30 minutes" I say "Let's just go back to camp" Jennie said gripping my arm "alright" I say with a slight blush "Oh someone is crushing hard" Alex said while throwing his arm around me "Fuck off Alex," "Alright alright" he laughs  
"How are you this happy? we just found dead people," I say with an irritated tone.  
"Because this means we are another step closer to finding out what happened to those boys,"  
"We need to report this in the morning, Alex" Jayden says "Yeah I know" Alex replies.

we made it back to camp and we noticed something odd Jayden was gone he just vanished.  
we called out into the forest for him but no one replied.

"god damn it" I yelled  "Find him Alex he's your friend," Jennie said Oh come on how about you and Josh go search you know get some alone time," "Fuck off Alex," Jennie replied "Come on Jennie let's just go look for him," "alright let's go" as we walk away she flips off Alex who just laughs

After about 15 minutes of walking, we hear strange noises like someone wheezing we walk towards the wheezing where we find Jayden lying there intestines strung out around him   
"Oh my fucking god" Jennie yells right after she throws up "H-Help Me Please" Jayden barely says before passing out. Jennie breaks into tears I grab her hand and run back to the camp when we get back there we find everyone is eaten all that's left is their intestines and their heads I run over to Alex's 

"No No No No No Alex No please how could this happen!" I scream for a little background me and Alex have been friends for years we were 12 when we met he was like my brother I'm not going to dwell on that for long.

"Josh we need to go now," Jennie says as she grabs my arm I wipe my tears and run with her to the car as we get to the car we sped off trying to get out of there as fast as possible that's when we saw it "Josh what is that? What the fuck is that?" Jennie screams I turn to look and that's when I saw it. a humanoid beast around 15 feet tall with a buck skull as its head with sharp yellow claws and teeth its skin was ashy, bones poked out of its skin eye was sunken in its head.

I push on the grass more 30, 40, 50 it's still gaining on us 60, 70 still gaining on us I take a hard turn and the beast runs off the road and that's when it screeched a horrible noise it sounded almost human but it was off it was like it was recorded like it was mimicking someone and that's when I noticed it. It was Alex's voice "J-Josh" It yelled "H-H-Help me" I held back my tears I sped off and made it out of the woods.

we went to the police after we made it back to the town, of course they were suspicious of us but they had no evidence of us doing anything wrong so they let us go.

It has been a couple of years now no one believes me what happened it hit Jennie a lot harder than it hit me she killed herself last year and I don't know what I should do I found a therapist but whenever I talk about it she looks at me like I'm crazy, I don't know what I should do now so I'm sharing this story with you all let me know if you have seen something like this before thank you and stay safe out there...
