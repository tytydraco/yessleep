I work as a bartender / barista at a cafe that’s open 24 hours. By day we serve coffee, by night alcohol. I possess no dreams or aspirations in life, so I work here almost every single day. Come to think of it, I don’t actually recall starting this job or what I did before it. It’s a bar with outdoor seating which makes for a unique vibe. However, it also means that anyone can show up at any time, including some real weirdos. Over the years, I’ve encountered many strange people, as I’m sure you can imagine. But on occasion, I come across a customer that leaves me baffled and frightened.

It’s three o’clock in the morning on a Saturday in July. Only a few customers tonight. That is until a rugged older man on a motorcycle pulls up by his lonesome. He plops down on the barstool and orders a Gin and Tonic with lime. Not the drink choice I expected out of this burly guy, but alright. 

He’s stoic, not saying much. I try to make small talk, but to no avail. This happens often. Many people want to be left alone, so I don’t think it’s anything unusual. He sips his drink in silence. Since there’s nothing for me to do, I clean the bar. I look up and he’s gone. I’m not sure how he got up so quick, it seems like I should have seen him in my peripheral vision. All that remains is a One hundred-dollar bill placed neatly underneath his empty glass.

In the following days, he becomes a regular. And slowly days turn into weeks. No matter what, he always evades my gaze. Eventually, I decide to figure out his trick. I keep my eye on him at all times, thinking there’s no way he can escape now.

I stare him down. This is his usual time to slip away. I got him. He’s still here, staring at me. This time, he finally starts talking. He recites what sounds to me like a sermon. I'm perturbed by this, the way he speaks makes my hair stand on end.

“Remember, God has a purpose in your life. All you gotta do is ask him, for he has designed a plan for you. He wants you to be lively and successful. One way you can ensure this is by giving tithes and offerings to the church. This is one key to success as outlined by the Gospel.” 

“Uh, sir?”

As if not noticing my presence, he continues speaking his lesson. I stare in disbelief, waving my hand in his face. 

"Excuse me? Hello?"

The TV on the wall behind me then changes channels. A man in a tacky white suit says word for word what the stranger seated at the bar says. I don’t recognize the guy on the TV, though I’m not exactly an expert on preachers. I keep trying to interrupt the mysterious biker, but he won’t quit blabbering. Not knowing what to do, I slam my hand on his mouth, covering it.

His speaking halts. Finally, I think. The man on the TV ceases his sermon as well, and his eyes dart around in terror.

“No! No! Don’t do this! It’s not my fault!” He says.

His head bursts into flames, and he drops to the floor with a thud. A live audience gasps and the channel abruptly turns to static. My heart races. I turn back to once again find the mystery man gone.
