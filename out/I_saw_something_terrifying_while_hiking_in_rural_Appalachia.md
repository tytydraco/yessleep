For context, I am a professional wilderness explorer. Since I was young, my passion had been geared towards the wilderness. I have hiked on rough terrain in many countries. I know the wilderness like it was my own precious child. I research what specific wildlife lives in the area before I go hiking, so I know what to be prepared for. That's what makes this ordeal even more terrifying.

One day, while browsing through a travel site for West Virginia, I saw a pop-up for a specific mountain trail. Again, nothing seemed out of the ordinary while researching, and it really seemed like the ideal hiking spot, leading up to a beautiful view showing a gorgeous blue lake.

When researching the trail, it was mentioned that the area was very isolated, with the nearest town being 123 miles away. It seemed very enticing. Of course, it had to normal flora and fauna of the region, and it didn't seem odd. It did mention not to disturb the wildlife and to watch where you step because of many false footholds,  
that would break away and cause you to fall down the Cliffside. Overall, it's just the normal mountain trail.

I spent about a month preparing for this trip. I made sure to contact everyone I knew so they would know where I was in case I went missing. I then drove there and started my hike.

Once I got there, I relished at the beauty of it all. The start of the trail had a view of many peaks staring down at you, and I thought to myself how the view looked like giant gods, towering over the world. I then started on the trail.

At first, everything was fine. It was your typical mountain trail. I made sure I took a break every fifteen minutes or so, so I didn't overwork myself and have to call quits. 

It was around my fifth break that things started to seem off. The birds had stopped singing, and I couldn't hear the chattering of insects. I didn't even hear the wind blowing through the trees. It was as if everything had vanished.

After about five minutes, I started on the hike again. I was a little nervous and on edge, though, because I was the loudest thing there. It felt wrong, as though I was being watched, stared down by some malevolent force, playing with me. 

I continued, until around break number twenty. 

I stopped, getting out my bottle of water, as I had done multiple times before. But as I was putting the bottle to my lips, I realized something was off. I heard twigs snapping, about ten feet behind me. I threw my water bottle down and turned around to see what I heard.

I can't describe exactly what I saw. That is a bit too difficult. The creature I saw was vaguely humanoid, bipedal, with pale, paste like skin. Its face, though, was certainly not. It had eyes that I can only describe as being too big to fit its face. Its face, though small, still surrounded the eyes, bit I swear its eyes were too big. The creatures mouth was indescribable, but I think the closest I could use for you to picture it would be to say that it was somewhere in between a human and a dog mouth, with five layers of knife like teeth. Its hands were freakishly large, about the size of my arm, with long skinny fingers to match. About the rest of it, I can't really describe. It was a sort of blur, almost hard to see. That's all I remember about its lower half.

I stood still, staring at the thing. It hadn't noticed me yet, but it wouldn't be long before it did. 

It was then that I started to sneeze, and then the creature really noticed me. 

It turned its head around, but instead of attacking me, it spoke.

"Ahnigi'a" it said, in a deep guttural voice. 

"I don't understand," I said, confused, startled by its speaking.

It looked at me, pushed its head forward, as if to say "leave".

I then started to run, leaving in fear. I made sure it didn't follow, and I ran till I got to my cat.

I recently tried to do research, but I haven't found anything on it. 

But what I do know is that it spoke in cherokee. It told me to leave. I have researched the region and have seen that many people have come up missing there. I now think about the human like sorrow in that creatures eyes, and I think I know why it wanted me to leave.
