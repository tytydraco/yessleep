My friend introduced me to it today at school. He knew I always loved playing those sleepover games. I always had a thing for urban legends. Bloody Mary, The Midnight Game, Charlie Charlie, Queen of Spades, all of it. Most guys my age had grown out of these things, but not me. I still love it all. So when he told me about a new one, I got excited.

 

We made plans to play it later tonight. Apparently it only works between the hours of 1 AM and 3 AM. But if there’s one thing I am, it’s impatient. I wanted to know more. I wanted to see other people play it. So I looked it up... but I couldn’t find anything. Not a single reference online.

 

It really bummed me out because I figured that meant he just made the whole thing up... but the thing is, if you knew my friend, you would know that he doesn’t have that kind of imagination. He’s not a big horror guy. He just doesn’t think that way. So I’m pretty confused and starting to get freaked out about it all. That’s why I’m making this post now. I need to know if anyone else has heard of this game. Have you played it? Did it work? Please let me know.

 

For those curious, I’ve included all the rules and steps as my friend had explained them (I had him text it to me so this should be accurate, but if you know an alternate version, contact me):

 

You need to be alone, in a room with no light, with a single wick candle and a mirror (or another reflective surface.)

 

Sit or stand in front of the mirror, and place the candle on a table or desk in front of you. Then light the candle. You must be able to clearly see your face in the reflection.

 

Close your right eye, slowly draw a circle with your finger around the reflection of your left eye. Then open your right eye again.

 

Hover your hand over the candle’s flame, just low enough to feel the heat. Take three deep breaths and then recite the following rhyme:

 

“Candle Caine walks in the candle light. Can’t wear skin, it is far too tight.

He makes no sound, he makes no tracks. Candle Caine lives in the candle wax.

A toast to you, this wondrous night. I hope to sate your appetite.

One eye missing, one will remain. I now belong to Candle Caine.”

 

You then bring your hand back, and count out loud to 13. You must maintain eye contact with your reflection as you do. If your candle begins to flicker as you count, then Candle Caine is with you.

 

After counting to 13, blow out the candle. Take three more deep breaths. Then light the candle again.

 

Supposedly, if you’ve done it right, the eye you drew a circle around will now be missing from your reflection, and a ghostly hand will appear in the glow of the candle and put out the flame.

 

That’s the ritual as I know it. What happens after, my friend didn’t say... I’ve played all of these games for years, but for whatever reason, this one unnerves me. Where did it come from? Who is Candle Caine? I hope somebody can help shed a light on this... I’m starting to get cold feet about tonight.
