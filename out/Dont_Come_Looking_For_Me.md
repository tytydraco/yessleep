 First off, all names in this re telling have been changed. I won’t be giving mine or anyone else’s to protect their families from harassment, speculation, or anything else that might come from this getting out.

Second, and this is important, **don’t come looking for me**. I’m serious, I’m not lost, I don’t want to be found. I don’t care who you are, journalist, law enforcement, search and rescue, or just a curious hiker. Stay the hell away from me. This is a warning, not a breadcrumb trail.

I’ll start from the beginning.

I’ve been a volunteer with search and rescue for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve had the honor of finding four lost souls, usually just people that went off trail and got turned around in the woods. However, this case was different. The missing person, Kevin, was a 14-year-old boy. He had gone on a 5-day hiking trip with his father. When the pair didn’t return after 7 days, the mother reported them missing.

The camp was discovered a few days into the search, or at least what was left of it. Their tent was shredded, dry blood all over the place, bits of bone and cloth scattered among the fallen leaves. The father was found nearby. His throat was ripped out, and his left arm had been torn clean off the body. A large hole was in his stomach, most of his organs savagely removed. Yet, no sign of what happened to the child. We had been combing the woods for nearly a month since, and everyday that passed made it less likely we would find Kevin alive.

Mercifully, it had been a mild winter. Temperatures never dropped much below freezing, even at night, which gave Kevin a *slim* chance of survival. We had been searching for hours, the sun slowly dipping past the treeline. His trail had gone cold. We had nothing to show for our efforts, no footprints, no calls answered, nothing.

“I really don’t think we are going to find this kid” mumbled Charles, my search partner, his voice slightly muffled by the protein bar he was chewing on.

“If we do find him, it will probably be a corpse.” He added.

“Then we bring back his corpse” I snapped, “or maybe you want to tell his mother, who just lost her husband, that you were too tired to continue looking for her son?”

Charles glared at me but said nothing.

“You volunteered for this, for fuck sakes.” I said, ending the discussion.

Neither of us spoke for a long moment, then Charles broke the awkward silence.

“I’m just… tired, man.”

I rubbed my face and nodded; we were both exhausted beyond words at this point.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “Me too.”

I liked Charles, don’t get me wrong, but his constant complaining was starting to grate on me. He was a big, stocky guy, about six-foot-three, with broad shoulders and thick arms. His size alone would be enough to deter a bear. Him and I had gone out in search and rescue missions before; he was a good guy; he just liked to complain a bit too much.

For a while, neither of us spoke to one another, the only sounds were our boots crunching through leaves and branches. Charles occasionally glanced at the GPS, (something each team was assigned) ensuring we didn’t get lost ourselves. Then a sharp, electronic chirp broke the dull silence, the satellite phone. Charles dug it out of his pocket, flipped it open, and spoke.

“Charles with Search Team Three, go ahead… Yeah… no, still no sign of him… We’re a few hours out from the vehicles… Copy that.”

He clicked it off, slipped it back into his pocket, and shook his head slightly.

“The other teams aren’t reporting anything either,” Charles grumbled. “Another bust.”

I ran my fingers through my hair, something I did to cope with stress, then said, “let’s take a quick break, then look for a little longer.”

“Don’t have to tell me twice”, Charles groaned as he shifted his backpack off his huge shoulders and onto the grass.

He sifted through his bag, moving aside a mess of gear, before pulling out a water bottle and taking a long drag. In the jumble, something bright orange caught my eye, a flare gun.

“When the hell did you get a flare gun?” I asked him.

“Last week” he responded, flashing me a wicked grin, “figured it could come in handy.”

We sat there for a couple minutes, recharging our energy. Charles ate another protein bar, while I absentmindedly sharpened a stick with my pocketknife. I suddenly became aware that the woods had gone dead silent. The usual background sounds of the forest had completely vanished. The only sound audible was Charles chewing, if not for that, I might have thought I had been struck deaf.

Behind us, the faint rustle of foliage being moved through was heard. We both froze mid motion and slowly turned towards the new sound. The rustling got louder as whatever it was made its way towards us. Then, from between the narrow trunks of the trees, someone staggered out into view.

It was a boy, filthy, his face pale and straked with dirt and grime. Once he saw us he suddenly stopped, swaying slightly on his feet.

“Holy crap.” Breathed Charles, rising to his feet, “Kevin?”

We rushed towards him but then stopped after a few feet once we got a better look. I thought back the the photograph we were given, I had studied it for hours, burning the image into my mind. Kevin was supposed to be a little pudgy, with shoulder length brown hair, and big, soft brown eyes.

The thing in front of us barely resembled him at all.

He was rail thin, his skin stretched tight over bone. He wore a baggy black sweater and dirty blue pajama bottoms. The clothes hung off him like they belong to someone twice his size. He bore no hair. None on his head or face, even his eyebrows had vanished. Paired with his pale, tight, raw looking skin, his head had the appearance of a bleached skull. however, those big brown eyes were unmistakable.

“Please” Kevins rasped, his voice weak and hardly audible, “I’m lost.”

“Hey, hey, its ok buddy, your safe now.” Charles assured the child, as he dropped to one knee and rummaged through his pack. “People have been looking for you for weeks, you’re probably starving.”

Kevin nodded, reaching out his spindly arms to accept the cookie and Gatorade bottle that Charles offered him. The boy clumsily pulled off the wrapper on the snack, broke off a small piece, and dropped it into his mouth.  Almost Immediately, he doubled over and started coughing violently. A deep and raw sound that shook his whole body, his thin shoulders jerking fiercely.

“Easy there, you ok?” I asked him, stepping closer.

Kevin composed himself, before spitting into the dirt. He looked up at me, and I saw that tears had rimmed his big brown eyes.

“It burns” he croaked.

“What does, the cookie?” I asked him.

Kevin nodded, “everything I eat burns, it doesn’t matter what it is, but I’m so hungry…”

His stomach gave a loud growl, and he suddenly stuffed the rest of the cookie into his mouth. His face furrowed with the expression of extreme pain as he swallowed hard, shuddering and groaning. Charles and I exchanged a glance, something was very wrong here.

As Charles relayed the good news to dispatch, the satellite phone firmly pressed to his ear, I focused on the child. Kevin sat on a tree stump, and using antiseptic, I cleaned the small abrasions along his shins and forearms, trying to be gentle. He didn’t flinch, he didn’t even blink, just stared off into space. His eyes half lidded and glassy, like he was half asleep, or half dead.

“What happened at your camp?” I asked him, trying to keep him talking.

Kevin gave a small shrug; his gaze still fixed on nothing.

“I’m not exactly sure. It was pitch black out. Something pulled me out of my tent in the middle of the night…”

He paused, swallowing hard.  
“…and bit me.”

My hand froze mid-swab, and I stopped to stare at him.

“Bit you?” I echoed. “Where?”

 Kevin pulled at the collar of his sweater, revealing a wound on his shoulder.

The bite was massive. It had encompassed his entire shoulder; his flesh had been punctured in a jagged crescent, and you could clearly see where upper and lower jaws had clamped down. The gap between each tooth mark was almost big enough to fit a thumb inside, and the bite stank faintly of iron and rot. Yet, despite the horrific brutality of it, the injury looked old, like it had happened years prior.

“Holy crap,” I gasped, “that’s a brutal bite, was it a bear?”

Again, Kevin shrugged. “Like I said, it was dark out, my dad knocked it off me and shouted at me to run, so I did. I could hear him fighting with…whatever it was, as I ran as fast as I could away from camp. I’ve been alone ever since.”

His breath hitched as tears began to streak down his dirty face, I put a hand on his back, attempting to comfort him. “don’t worry, Kevin, were getting you home.”

“Have you found my dad?”

I hesitated for a moment, not sure if I should tell him about the mauled and partially devoured body found at his campsite. I didn’t want to send him into shock; it could kill him.

“No” I lied, “but well find him too” I said with an uneasy, nervous smile.

Wanting to change the subject, I asked. “What happened to your hair?”

Flatley, Kevin responded with a simple “it fell out,” like he was unaware how strange it sounded, before adding, “just like my teeth.”

Kevin finally faced me, then opened his mouth. The smell that rolled out was sour and putrid, like food left too long in the sun. Only a handful of teeth remained, maybe 10 or 12 in all, unevenly scattered across his pale, bleeding gums. I tried my best not to look disgusted, but Kevin noticed the change in my expression and closed his mouth with a hint of embarrassment.  

Charles walked towards us, frowning and shaking his head.

“We won’t be able to get a chopper out here till the morning” Charles explained, rubbing the back of his neck. “Apparently, there all tied up with other rescues.”

“of course,” I groaned, once again running my fingers through my hair. “So, what’s the plan then?”

Charles glanced at the GPS in his hand before speaking “dispatch gave me the coordinates of an old cabin about a 30-minute walk from here; we could crash for the night there and get picked up in the morning.”

I nodded in agreement, then turned to face Kevin, “you up for a little more hiking?”

Kevin simply responded with a weak, toothless grin.

As we moved towards our destination, I couldn’t help but notice something unsettling: the sounds of the woods still hadn’t returned. With Kevin in tow, the world seemed to hold its breath, silent, watchful, as if the forest itself was wary of him.

After trudging through mud and weeds, we came to a small clearing and spotted the cabin. The wood was rotten, warped from years of neglect, and the roof sagged unevenly in places. Moss crept up the walls, and vines snaked through cracks in the timber. The windows were filthy, letting in only faint smudges of the fading light.

The porch groaned under our collective weight, the loose boards threatening to snap. I pushed the rickety door open and smelled the faint aroma of mold and dust that wafted lazily outside to greet us. It was barely larger than a single room. The only things visible inside were a couple of stools, a slanted table, a caved in pot belly stove, and a rusty fire poker. It was a shit hole, but it would do for the night, if it didn’t collapse on us first.

We sat around the table, the butts of our flashlights resting on the warped tabletop, their beams angled upward, sending weak cones of light towards the crooked ceiling. We distributed out a baggie of trail mix between the three of us for a meager supper. Kevin ate slowly, picking up small fingerfuls of nuts and raisins, carefully dropping them into his mouth. Each time he would cough violently, his entire frame jerking with each rasp. We tried to tell him to take it easy, but he waved us off, insisting that he was ok.

After we ate, we passed the time with a couple games of cards, as the forest outside grew dark. The mood settled into something calm, almost relaxed. We were just three people hiding out from the cold, killing time with a few rounds of blackjack.

“Well, that was fun,” Charles chuckled as he sifted through his bag, pulling out the flare gun. He spun it playfully in his hand, his grin twisting into something mischievous.

“Alright, gentlemen,” he said, cocking an eyebrow, “who’s up for a round of Russian roulette?”

We all laughed, the sound bouncing off the moldy, rotten walls.

The full moon hung high, its dull light cutting through the grime smeared windows and spilling onto Kevins back. He suddenly froze mid laugh, his smile melting into a blank expression, his eyes unfocused. Then he pitched forwards, puking violently.

The first wave hit the table with a wet splash, splattering across his cards and spilling over the tables edge in thick rivulets. The stench of half-digested trail mix filled the cramped space almost instantly.

“Shit!” I blurted, scrambling to my feet and stepping back fast enough to avoid the spray.

“You okay, kid?” Charles asked. He’d risen too, joining me with a grimace. His voice tried for concern but couldn’t quite hide a hint of disgust.

“I think so…” Kevin replied, wiping his chin with his hand. “Not sure why that happ-“

He didn’t finish. His chest lurched, and another violent spray of vomit spewed out of him. The second eruption was worse then the first, his few remaining teeth shot free of his mouth with the bile, bouncing and scattering on the vomit drenched floor like thrown dice.  

The boy gagged, then wrenched forward a third time. This time it wasn’t trail mix, but a thick, dark, red spray that gushed out in a pulsing ark, hitting the table once more, pooling on the worn floorboards.

The vomit stopped, but the sound didn’t, now it was a hideous dry heave. Kevins throat began to bulge like a toad, a fat goiter forming at the bottom of his neck, just above the collar bone. Each cough inched the bulge higher, towards his gaping mouth. Something inside him was pushing forwards, one retch at a time.

Kevins legs buckled, and he fell onto his hands and knees. He threw his entire body forward with each cough. The thing that had grown in his throat slowly began to emerge from his toothless mouth, forcing its way into the open. At first, I was unsure at what exactly I was seeing, but with a rush of dreaded clarity I new what it was. The nose and muzzle of a wolf. Kevin gagged as more of the snout slid free, slick with blood and mucus, glistening in the dim light of our flashlights.

 The boy fell onto his side, then rolled onto his back. He began to seize and buck, his arms snaped tight to his chest, then flailed outwards, his legs kicking spasmodically as though he were a puppet tugged by tangled strings.

His skin changed from ghostly pale to a shade of mottled grey, his veins blackening and pulsing beneath the flesh. The fingers spasmed, then ruptured, thick talons, black as pitch, burst from the tips as he continued to flail about, gouging the wood beneath him.

His frail frame began to swell. vomit-soaked clothes clung for only a moment before seems split and fabric tore, the sound sharp and wet as his body burst free from the restraints. While thick, course, black hair sprouted across his once hairless body, shrouding him in a wiry coat.

Charles shouted something, but the sound barely registered over the thunder of snapping bones. His limbs spasmed violently, arms and legs twisting at awkward angles before lengthening with sickening snaps. Cartilage stretched and tore, joints popping and reformed, until both his arms and legs were nearly twice their original length.

 The boys body no longer looked frail, no longer human. Every passing second brought him closer to something else, something that belonged in the silent woods we had been walking through.

The beast’s muzzle extended nearly six inches from Kevin’s mouth now, the wet snout unmistakably wolfish as the heavy brow began to come into view. His human mouth was split unnaturally wide, the angle impossible for any person, the flesh around his lips was stretched, red and splitting.

The boy let out a terrible noise, half gurgle, half scream as his frantic gaze fell on me, pleading confused horror etched into those big brown eyes, before rolling back in their sockets.

Charles and I pressed ourselves against the far wall of the cabin, cowering like a pair of rabbits trapped by a predator. My pocketknife shook in my grip, its blade feeling pitifully small. Charles held the fire poker in one hand, and the flare gun in the other. Both of us gawking at the thing between us and the door.

It was blocking the only exit, we were trapped.

The boy stopped convulsing and with his new form, slowly pushed himself upright, settling on his knees as if in prayer. Weak, half-hearted coughs still rattled out of him, each one bubbling wetly. Blood dribbled from the narrow gap where human mouth met animal muzzle.

 Though Kevins eyes had rolled back into milky whites, tears still streamed down his cheeks, dripping into the gore below. It slowly reached upwards with its new, huge, malformed claws, seizing Kevins lower and upper jaws, and began tugging them in opposite directions. Kevin gave one more weak cough before his skull was pulled apart. The sound was worse than the sight, a brittle crack snap as his head was pulped, hunks of bone and gore dropping onto the floor of the cabin.

It knelt there with its head bowed, supporting itself with its knuckles like a primate, breathing slowly. Deep, steady, and ragged.

I prayed, desperately, that it would leave through the door, vanish into the black woods outside, joining whatever other horrors roamed the night.

Then it lifted its head to face us, and time turned to ooze.

The thing before us was a nightmare mix of human and predator. Its face was elongated and wolf-like, feral amber eyes sat deep in its skull, radiating a kind of starved malice. Thick black hair sprouted across its face, framing the gaping maw with matted clumps, and its cracked, rotten, grey skin stretched taut over high cheekbones.

Its torso was emaciated yet unnaturally muscular, sinews flexing under its skin. Dark, wiry hair ran down its back, curling around the shoulders and arms. The arms themselves were unnaturally long, with hands that ended in long digits tipped with blackened, hooked claws, and knuckles protruded like small stones beneath the thin skin.

Its legs mirrored the arms in their monstrous distortion: thin yet strong. Veins pulsed beneath the stretched, almost reptilian-like skin, and tufts of coarse hair sprouted along the ankles and shins, connecting to powerful thighs that seemed ready to spring at any moment.

Its yellow eyes fixed on us, nostrils flaring as it sniffed the foul air of the cabin, every motion unnervingly predatory. Its upper lip curled back, exposing jagged teeth that gleamed in the light of the flashlights. A bright red tongue came out to wet its blood covered muzzle, followed by a low, guttural snarl that rumbled from deep in its throat, a sound both animal and disturbingly human.

Then it lunged.

It zeroed in on Charles first, no doubt seeing the larger man as the greater threat. Charles tried to swing the fire poker, but he was too slow. It slammed into him like a linebacker, sending Charles crashing against the wall, the flare gun flying out of his hands, sailing across the cabin space.

I reacted instantly, stabbing forwards with the knife, sinking the blade into its arm. The thing screamed and turned to face me, snarling. It retaliated by slashing one of its enormous claws at me in an upwards arc, raking across my chest, knocking me to the cabins floor with a bone jarring smack.

It turned its attention back to Charles, and jumped on top of him, pinning him to the ground under its bulk. Its jaws clamped down on his huge Trapezius with an audible crunch. Charles screamed, desperately swinging the fire poker, striking the beast in the ribs. It grunted in pain, released him, and staggered back, but only briefly.

 Before Charles could stand back up, one of its clawed hands shot down, sinking deep into his upper stomach. Then, with monstrous ease, it dragged its claws towards the big man’s groin, ripping open Charles’s abdomen as effortlessly as unzipping a jacket. Charles clutched at his insides and cried out in agony. Then, as if in reply, the thing lifted its head to the ceiling, letting out an ear shattering cry of its own. It wasn’t a wolf’s howl, it sounded like a person imitating a wolf, feral and twisted, with a base that rattled the bones. Then it plunged its snout into the gaping wound, wolfing down large gobbets of organs.

I slowly sat up, my ribs screaming, no doubt some where cracked. I spotted something bright orange laying a few feet from me. The flare gun, salvation. Slowly, agonizingly, I crawled towards it. Through my peripheral, I saw the thing twist in my direction, drawn to fresh movement, bloody bits of intestine dripping from its teeth. My hands closed around the grip of the flare gun as it pounced, aiming for my neck. Instinct took over, I threw my arm up to protect my throat. Its jaws clamp down on my forearm with bone crushing force, I felt and heard a sharp crack as pain exploded up my shoulder. I didn’t have time to think, only act. With my free arm, I aimed the flare gun at the things face and pulled the trigger. A blinding red light erupted from the barrel, the flare striking straight into its eye.

It yelped, released my arm, and started clawing at the flare, trying in vain to dislodge the burning projectile. Flames quickly caught, licking across its hairy face, and soon its head had  transformed into a writhing fireball. It shrieked in agony and slashed about the cabin, striking at the walls and floor, causing the fire to spread.

Smoke quickly filled the small room, making it difficult to breathe. I shakily got to my feet and hobbled as fast as I could to the doorway, my ribs screaming with each movement. Sparks rained down around me as the cabin began to burn. I reached the threshold and forced myself to glance back one last time. The cabin was a hellscape. Charles lay on his back, unmoving, a massive hole torn through his stomach. His insides where strewn across the floor around him, the thick smell of copper adding its scent to the miasma of burning hair and vomit. The creature thrashed on the floor, flailing wildly as it tried to extinguish the flames that had now completely consumed it. Its shrieks climbed higher and higher, warping and thinning until they sounded almost like the screams of a child.

Smoke curled into the night air as I stepped out, gasping for breath. I got a couple feet outside before falling. The night sky stretched endlessly, the moon hanging heavy and ominous, casting a pale light over the burning structure.

My vision blurred, pain radiating through my body as I slowly slipped away. Lulled into unconsciousness by the cacophony of roaring flames, and a child’s death wails.

It was morning when I stirred awake, dew clung to me like a second skin. For a moment disorientation clouded my mind, I didn’t know where I was, but then reality hit me like a crashing wave. Slowly, I got to my feet, anticipating pain. Yet to my astonishment, there was none. I glanced at my arm, where the beast had bitten me. It bore a huge bite mark, nearly identical in shape to the one Kevin had on his shoulder. The skin had healed over, the edges faint and scarred as if the injury was weeks old, like it hadn’t happened last night at all.

A sharp, gnawing hunger gripped me, more demanding than anything I had ever felt before. I felt like I was starving. I cautiously approached the burnt remains of the cabin. The roof had collapsed in places; the walls reduced to smoldering husks. Amazingly, the flames hadn’t spread to the surrounding forest, the fire apparently had consumed itself and died out.

My gaze fell on something large sprawled on the floor. Canine jaws, jutted grotesquely from a twisted body left contorted in the agony of death. I noticed another figure in the ruins, Charles. His skin was split and cracked from the heat, most of his hair and clothes were gone, burned away to nothing. I wanted to pay my respects, but my growling stomach demanded that I fill it before doing anything else.

 I sifted through the debris for something to devour, a morsel, a crumb, anything. I lifted a charred beam of wood and spotted something underneath. It was a backpack, the one that belonged to Charles. As I hoisted it up, it tore open, spilling its contents onto the blackened floor. Inside there was the GPS, the satellite phone, and a granola bar.

 I immediately reached for the food, tore open the packaging, and took a huge bite. The first thing I noticed was the taste, or the lack of it. It wasn’t sweet, bland, or stale. It burned. Like hot ash smeared across my tongue, as if I was chewing on charcoal pulled straight from a fire. The next sensation was a sharp stabbing pain that shot through my jaw like lightning. I winced and yanked the bar out of my mouth, coughing hard. When the pain faded, I gazed down at the bar, and to my horror, there were two teeth embedded into it. I poked my index finger into my mouth, feeling the gaping hole where two upper teeth had once been. My breath hitched as I raised my other hand to my head, running my hand through my hair, then froze as something came loose in my grasp. Strands of hair slid free between my fingers. I stared, dumbly, as they drifted down and settled on the blackened floor.

Whatever Kevin was inflicted with, disease, curse, I wasn’t sure, was now inside me. I was going to turn into a monster. If I was rescued, I would kill anyone, everyone. Kevin hadn’t recognized us when he transformed, I doubt I would be any different. I wouldn’t be able to control myself. My world swam as I evaluated my situation, trying to will away the inevitability. There had to be some sort of loophole, some way to survive without condemning everyone around me, but there wasn’t. not anymore.

I tried taking matters into my own hands. I found my knife buried in the cabins remains. I hung it inches from my wrist, commanding myself to slash them open, but my body just would not listen. I stood there for what felt like forever, trying to will myself into ending it, but I just couldn’t. Overwhelmed, I sank to the ground and folded in on myself, sobbing into the ash and soot.

In the distance, I heard the steady thrum of helicopter blades cutting through the morning air, a sound that made my body flood with fresh dread. They followed the signal from the satellite phone. I couldn’t be found. I wouldn’t be found.

Gripping the satellite phone in my hand, I turned and ran through the forest, crashing through the underbrush as fast as my legs would carry me. The entire time feeling the teeth in my skull wiggle like a pocket full of loose change.

The sound of the helicopter slowly faded, but I didn’t stop running till it was completely swallowed by the still silence of the woods. I stopped to catch my breath next to a shallow puddle of water, feeling the faint hum of the satellite phone in my hand. They would trace the signal eventually, but here in the deep forest, they wouldn’t be able to land.

 I knelt next the the murky pool, cupping my hands and bringing the water to my lips. The moment the liquid touched my tongue, I knew I made a mistake. It burned like battery acid, and I immediately spat it out, a couple of my teeth coming out with it. My eyes watered as I let out another flurry of violent, dry, coughs. I couldn’t imagine Kevin doing this for 3 weeks.

That brings me to now. I currently have my back against a fallen tree, sitting in a shallow nest of my own fallen hair, pecking this out letter by letter on the satellite phone. Its agonizingly slow, but its not like I have anything better to do.

I have no doubt there will be another full moon tonight. And when it rises, I’ll change, just like Kevin did.

What keeps gnawing at me isn’t the if, but the how. Will I still be conscious and aware, enjoying the carnage I cause? Or will I be shoved into the dark, locked in the passenger seat, forced to watch through the things eyes as I become nothing but hunger and teeth and claws?

The sun is sinking behind the mountains now, dragging the light with it. Night is coming, and with it, the change.

I don’t think I’ll be here in the morning. The beast won’t linger; it will hunt, it will wander, sniffing out fresh prey. By the time I wake again, if I wake, I’ll be deeper in the wilderness, covered in blood that isn’t mine.

Maybe, if I’m lucky, it will carry me far from anyone. Far from towns, from homes, from families. Maybe the only thing it will kill tonight is me, but I doubt I’ll get *that* lucky.

Again, I want to emphasize, **don’t come looking for me**. I’m too dangerous now. I don’t want to hurt anyone, and I don’t want to be found. I’m writing this so there’s a record of what happened, and as a warning to anyone who might think about searching for me. Please, if you value your safety, stay away.
