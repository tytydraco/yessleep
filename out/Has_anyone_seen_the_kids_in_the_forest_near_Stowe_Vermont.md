My name is Jason Potter. I am twenty three and recently got out of college in Washington. The reason I am writing this is because I found some oddly creepy photos and began to remember what happened in those small woods. My mother and father decided to invite me back out to my childhood home in Stowe, Vermont. We lived on the outskirts of the main town and lived near the woods. I used to explore the woods with my father and we would create paths so we could find our way back home. We used to go out looking for mushrooms a lot and we would cook them with most of our dinners.

I decided to travel back and visit my parents for a couple of days. The first day I had arrived, they took me into town to visit all of their friends and show them how big I had gotten. Then we visited some of my friends, (mainly my former girlfriend who wasn't too thrilled to see me.)

Once we got back, I asked if I could go out towards the woods with my father, just like old times. He agreed and we went to the back porch where I could see three separate trails that led in different directions. They were all labeled after different kinds of fungus. The one on the far right was called 'Witches Butter' and had a picture of said fungus. The middle one was called 'Puffball' and seemed to branch out into two more different directions. The last one on the far left was named 'Dead Mans Fingers' and seemed to just go straight.

"How about we go onto Witch? That one has some interesting things and it's short enough so that we don't get lost when it gets dark." I agreed with him and we began to walk down the path. He wasn't wrong about it being short. It only took about thirty minutes until we reached the end. There was something interesting at the end though.

"Is that another trail?" When I asked him the question, he seemed almost hesitant to answer. He continued to look down the next trail. It was cut off from the original, but still close enough to be considered a part of the same one. "Dad?"

"I think that one must be connected to one of the others. It is getting a little to late now so I think we should head back to the house. Your mother is probably getting worried." He began to walk the other way without me. I continued to stare at the separated path, wondering where it would lead.

Just when I was about to turn around, I swear I saw someone running towards me on that same path. "What the fuck," I yelled as I fell to the ground. The figure began to get closer and closer, before it stopped. I still couldn't see it because of the shade that had surrounded it, but it looked human. It then bolted to the right and dissipated into the trees.

"Jason? What happened?" My dad helped me up as I shook myself down. I couldn't stop thinking of what that thing could have been. It freaked me out so bad that I could feel my legs start to quiver.

"I thought I saw someone run down that path. I'm probably just tired though." I looked at my dad, but he was no longer looking at me. He was instead staring at that separated path that lay in front of us. His eyes were locked in on the trail that the person had run down. "Dad?"

"I bet it's those damn kids that have been around the neighborhood. They've been playing pranks on us like that, trying to scare us. It's going to bite them in the butt when they give us a heart attack though." He gave a hard laugh and began to walk away again. I decided that I wouldn't wait and that I would immediately follow him.

When we got back home, my mother had cooked us dinner and we began to eat. We talked about how I had been off at college, trying to become a writer. Then I asked them about the kids that have been around the neighborhood. "How did you know about the children?" My mom seemed startled when I asked her.

"He thinks he saw one on the false trail down on 'Witches Butter'. Probably tried to scare him too." He laughed a bit more, yet my mother still seemed worried. Something stuck out to me though.

"False trail? I thought you said it was apart of one of the other ones?"

My father choked a bit on his food and then said while pounding his chest, "Yeah. I just call it that because it doesn't connect to the original one." He continued to cough some more as my mother asked if he needed some water. He eventually stopped.

After dinner I went to be as my parents began to head to bed. I wished them goodnight as they did the same and we went in our separate directions. I could barley sleep that night. All I could think about was the person that had been running at me in the woods. What did dad mean when he said false trail? I had heard about them on the news. People would create these trails that branched off from the original one so people could get lost. It was a weird occurrence, yet it still happened around the woods. I started to wonder if there may have been some killer in the woods near my parents house.

Then I heard a light tapping from my window. I looked up and saw two pairs of bunny ears sticking out from outside the window. I jolted up and turned on my lamp, but then they were gone. They didn't move, didn't glide across the frame, just disappeared. I stood up and practically ran to the window, looking for any sign of a person. I couldn't see anyone though. Nothing indicated that there had been something, and I had no courage to go outside to check. I walked back to bed, turned off the light, took some melatonin, and began to drift off to sleep.

When I woke up around six, I began to make my way to the kitchen. I slowly made it to the kitchen where I was wanting to start a pot of coffee, then realized that a pot was already being made. I thought that my father may have been awake, so I walked around trying to find him. When I made my way to the back porch, I could see that the sliding glass door was open. I walked outside feeling the cool January night breeze wash across my face. I shivered a bit before I continued out onto the porch. I could hear rustling from the side of the house as I made my way further onto the porch.

I started to get freaked out and quickly brought out my phone so I could turn on the flashlight. As the light enveloped the majority of the forest front, I couldn't find anything alarming that was near the trails. I slowly began to walk towards the side of the house. The fidgety sounds got louder as I got closer. I wondered if it was a bad idea to try and continue, but something inside of me beckoned me to follow the sounds.

Eventually I found the source of the sound. It was my father who was near the window to my room holding a dirty shovel with dirt covered hands. He looked up and gasped as he fell to the ground. "Goddammit Jason," He said as he massaged his back. "You about killed me."

"What are you doing out here dad? Why are you by the window?" I reached out my hand and helped him up as he continued to rub his back with his free hand. He bent down and picked up the shovel. I saw a hole that was dug pretty deep that was about five feet from the window."

"Did you see something outside your window last night?" The question made my stomach drop. I just thought it may have been because I was tired. Something I had created out of my fear that was so prevalent when that figure had ran at me on the trail.

"Yeah," I said a bit to quietly. "Yeah I did. How did you know?"

He began to reach into his back pocket and pulled out two square pieces of what seemed like paper. "Because something saw you." He reached out his hand and gave them to me. I grabbed them and looked at what was printed on them. They were Polaroids. One of them contained a picture of me sleeping in bed with my body turned towards the window. The next photo was of a mask. It was an owl mask with two green eyes that looked back. How had I not been awoken by the flash? Who the hell took a picture of me? Was this one of the kids that dad was talking about?

"What the hell? We have to show these to the police dad. They could probably find out who took the photos."

"We already tried that. They can't find any leads. I did find something else though." He pointed to the ground. As I looked, I could see footprints. They were small and seemed to lead down to the woods.

"What the fuck? So some kid took my picture and then ran back into the woods?"

"You should come inside. We can talk about this a bit more." I agreed and we walked into the house. Before I entered the door, I swear I could hear branches break from behind me. I whipped around right as my flashlight cut out. As I tried to turn it back on, a bright flash had blinded me again. Before I was completely blinded though, I saw three children in animal masks. One of them was in a fox mask, the next looked like a bear mask, and the one who took the picture was in the owl mask from before.

I could hear my dad rush out onto the porch with something in his hand. "Get the hell out of here you damn kids. I thought you were happy with us." I could hear laughing and then more branches snapped as my dad began to breathe heavily. When I could finally see again, I saw that he had a gun in his hand. It was a little revolver that he waved vigorously in the air.

"Jesus dad! Put that thing down before it goes off." I led him into the house, closed the door and then the curtains and sat him down on the couch. I walked around and closed every curtain that I could.

When I finished I finally sat down next to him as I brushed my hair with my hands. "It's fine," He said still breathing heavily. "It wasn't loaded. I just use it to scare the little bastards."

"You shouldn't have to in the first place. Why the hell are there masked children? Why do they keep taking pictures of me?"

My dad got up and walked away from the couch. I waited for him and he finally came back with a small photo book. "Here's some more pictures that those little shits took of us." I opened it and was immediately met by pictures of my parents sleeping in their bed. The deep pit in my stomach seemed to get bigger as I carefully examined each photo.

On the next page was more photos of the children in their masks. There was fox masks, bunny masks, owl masks, almost every kind of animal was captured in the mask's features. Each photo showed a new pair of different colored eyes. I began to wonder if this was more than a prank.

"And you already tried to call the police about it?"

"Yep. They kept looking around for any signs, but nothing showed up. We showed them every picture and tried to explain that we might be in danger. They just told us that these kids would eventually get tired of it. They eventually got stricter about curfew, yet no kids were ever caught sneaking out into the woods."

I started to think about what he had first said when he ran out onto the porch. "What did you mean when you said 'I thought you were happy'? Did you give them something?"

He froze and looked back at the photo book. "Do you remember the masks that you would bring home when you were younger?" He didn't look up at me when he said it. "You would tell us that you were going to go play in the woods, then come home after about two hours. When you would come home, you would have little photos of these children in the woods. They wore the same masks that you saw out there." He flipped to the next page and I saw photos of me with little photos. Sure enough, I had pictures of the animal children in their strange masks.

"Why can't I remember that? I can't remember anything like that."

My father continued with his story that he was telling. "Then one day, you came back with a mask. It was a gecko mask. You said that they gave it to you because you were one of them. I think you were seven when they started to get more dangerous. You would come home with scars and cuts along your arms and legs. You said that you had just got caught in one of those rose bushes. Your mother and I began to get worried, so we kept you at the house and didn't let you go play with them. Then they started to show up here."

"Oh my god. I still can't remember anything about that. Why can't I remember?"

"Because one night, they knocked you out and sent you into a coma. They had come in and tried to kidnap you. They dropped you on one of the steps and you wouldn't wake up. They ran away as soon as we came out. We took you to the doctor and you didn't wake up until two weeks later. You couldn't remember anything."

After we talked some more about the masks, I went to my room and started to write this. As of now I am still in Stowe, trying to find answers. I can keep writing these if people are interested, but I think I have to no matter what. I need to find out what those kids want. So I just have one question. Has anyone seen the kids in the forest near Stowe Vermont?
