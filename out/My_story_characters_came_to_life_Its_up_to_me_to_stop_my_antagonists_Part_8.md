“So, how do we find these two idiots?” Jake asked.

“Good question. I was wondering that myself,” I admitted.

“What did you say their names were again?” Sidney inquired.

“One of their names was Sam. The main character never mentioned his name.”

“Wait, is this guy a little bigger and kind of emo? I think I went to school with someone like that. He was always hanging out with this scrawny dude named Alex,” Jake said.

“That sounds accurate. It’s all we have to go off of, so let’s hope that’s who it is.”

“I follow him on Instagram. I’ll reach out to him.”

Jake began searching through his Instagram to find Sam. I turned to Sidney.

“Are you ready for this? It might get intense.”

She nodded.

“I’m ready for whatever this thing has to throw at us. I’ve never dealt with the occult before though,” she sheepishly confessed.

“I’m hoping we won’t have to interact with this thing much. If we can just find a copy of that spell book that Sam had, we might be able to reverse the damage.”

“Got an address,” Jake said, “125 North Appling Road. He’s ready for us whenever.”

“Okay, is everyone good to go? Let’s take this show on the road.”

We arrived at Sam’s house a few minutes later. The area wasn’t the best, but his house appeared to be well-kept from the outside. We hopped out of the car and marched up to the front door. Jake knocked.

The door creaked open. Someone peaked at us through the slim crack. 

“Jake?”

“Yeah, Sam, how’s it going?”

He opened the door the rest of the way revealing a disheveled sleep-deprived man. He looked awful. Deep purple bags rested beneath his eyes and his hair was a tangled rat’s nest. The stench that wafted into my nostrils made it abundantly clear that he hadn’t showered in some time. Sam smiled weakly at us. 

“Not so good, as you can see. Come on in. Sorry for the mess.”

We entered his cluttered home. Books and papers were strewn everywhere to the point where I could barely make out the floor. Empty take out boxes and beer cans adorned every visible surface. A grungy stained couch accounted for the only furniture in sight. Atop it sat a thin college-aged man wearing all black. Tattoos encompassed his arms and a bull ring protruded from his nose. He obviously hadn’t fared much better than his friend. 

“Jake, I’m sure you remember Alex.”

“Sup,” he said, not bothering to stand.

“Hey, Alex. Long time no see, buddy.” 

“I’m not your buddy. Remember swirly time? Yeah, I bet you don’t. Had me and about fifteen other kids on a weekly rotation. Fuck you for that.”

Sidney glared at Jake. He anxiously rubbed the back of his neck. 

“Hey, it was funny at the time. Not so funny looking back on it now… sorry.”

“Whatever. Who are you two?” Alex asked, directing his attention to Sidney and me. 

We proceeded toward the couch to greet him. He rose from his spot to welcome us.

“I’m Matt,” I said, firmly gripping his hand, “Jake’s brother. Sorry for… him. I don’t associate with his crowd.”

“Yeah, I think I remember you. Always stuck to your own devices. I dig that. And who might you be?”

“I’m Sidney. Nice to meet you,” she said, extending her hand. 

Instead of shaking it, Alex lifted it to his lips and kissed it. Sidney recoiled in disgust.

“A pleasure to meet you. What’s a pretty lady like yourself doing hanging out with these miscreants?”

I balled my fists, staring daggers at Alex’s forehead. 

“They’re my friends. And they’re not miscreants,” Sidney said matter-of-factly, taking refuge behind me.

“Looks like toilet time might be making a comeback,” Jake seethed, stepping toward the couch.

“Oh yeah? Try me.”

The two scowled at each other. The tension in the air was palpable. 

“Woah, no need for things to get out of hand. Let’s all just take a few deep breaths and get everything out of our systems,” Sam said, failing to calm a single one of us.

We all glowered at each other like we were in a Mexican standoff. 

“Uh, so about this demon thing-”

Sam was cut off mid-sentence.

“You mean the one standing right in front of me?” Alex hissed. 

Jake lunged forward, grabbing him by his shirt.

“Look here, you little shit. Do you want our help or not? Because I’d be more than happy to walk out that door and leave you to fix this on your own.”

“Let go of me,” Alex whined, fighting desperately to free himself from Jake’s iron grasp. 

Jake threw him back onto the couch. Alex glanced over at Sam. He nodded at him. 

“Fine, we’ll accept your help. But only because we have no other option. And once we get this cleared up, I don’t *ever* want to see you again. As for her, though…”

I pushed Sidney behind me.

“If you so much as look at her the wrong way, a swirly will be the least of your concerns,” I coldly assured him. 

“Okay, okay, let’s just get down to business,” Alex retorted.

“Alright. Tell us about the demon. Have you had any more encounters with it, and are you still seeing dead people?” I probed, still fuming from our prior interaction.

“No, and yes,” Sam said.

“We tried to contact it again without the book. No dice,” Alex added.

“Looks like we’ll need to find that book then,” Jake muttered.

“What was the book called?” Sidney squeaked, clutching my arm for reassurance.

“La Sangre de la Cabra,” Sam said.

“The Blood of the Goat…”

Jake raised an eyebrow at me.

“Don’t give me that look. I actually paid attention in my Spanish classes.”

“Alright, so how do we find it?” Sidney asked.

“That’s what I’ve been trying to figure out,” Sam remarked, “I’ve tried looking it up online, going to bookstores, hell I even tried finding that weird hippie lady. Nothing w-”

“You mean this book?” Jake interjected, showing Sam his phone.

“Uh, yeah… How did you…”

“Sam, you dumbass, you were probably spelling it wrong. I told you there’s no ‘y’ in sangre,” Alex spat. 

“Why didn’t you look up how to spell it then, wise guy?”

“Hey, hey, there’s no need to squabble over this. We found it now, so let’s just focus on tracking the thing down. Jake, is it in stock anywhere close?” I asked.

“Yeah, it says there’s one left at Maggie’s Antique Shop. Let’s try there.”

“Sounds like a plan. My car, uh, isn’t big enough to fit all of us. We’ll meet you guys there?” I suggested.

“Yeah, cool. And Sidney, feel free to ride with us if you’d like,” Alex grinned, winking at her.

“I wouldn’t get into a vehicle with you if you were the last person on the planet.”

“Ouch. Fine, have it your way. We’ll see you there.”

We rolled to a stop in front of a dinky little antique shop. All the windows were dark. “Maggie’s Antiques” was emblazoned across the storefront in exaggerated red letters. Paint pooled below them in what I assume was meant to resemble blood. “Enter at your own risk,” was scrawled haphazardly underneath. Those words sent a shiver rippling through my core. I couldn’t imagine any normal human being wanting to step foot within a fifteen mile radius of the place. 

“I think I’m going to stay in the car if that’s okay with you. I don’t feel comfortable around that Alex guy,” Sidney said.

“I don’t blame you. If tries anything at all, I’m going to make him wish he was never born,” I uttered.

Sidney blushed.

“My hero.”

“Come on, Jake. Let’s help these two shitheads and bounce ASAP. Alex really pisses me off.”

“I’m with you on that. Fucking creep.”

We approached the store to find that Alex and Sam were already waiting for us. Sam leaned against the wall, while Alex stood with his arms crossed beside him.

“Aw, the pretty princess won’t be joining us?”

That was it. I shoved him hard against the building’s rigid brick exterior. He winced. 

“I’ve had it with you hitting on her. One more sick comment or lewd gesture, and I will fucking *end you.* Got it?”

“Okay, man, geez. I was joking. Calm down,” he sputtered, clawing futilely at my hands in a vain attempt to escape my grasp. 

“Is everything okay out here?”

An old haggard woman appeared, peeking out the door at us. A shawl was wrapped around her head and the lower half of her face, concealing it from view. One of her eyes was missing an iris, pure white, save for the intermittent vein spider webbing within. Her unexpected interference startled me.

“Yeah, everything’s fine. We’re actually looking to make a purchase,” I said, relinquishing my grip on Alex’s T-shirt. 

She studied us for a moment, good eye scanning us like a cyborg.

“Alright. Come on in before I change my mind.”

We followed the eccentric woman to the counter, staring in awe at all the trinkets and oddities scattered around the store. 

“Are you going to tell me what you came here for or are you just going to stand there and gawk at everything?”

“Uh, yeah, right. Sorry. We came for a book. We were hoping you might have a copy,” Jake said, showing the woman, who by now I assumed to be Maggie, the image he had pulled up on his phone.

“Hmm, yes, La Sangre de la Cabra. It’s one of my best sellers. I’ll get it from the back for you.”

Alex nudged Sam in the ribs.

“What the hell, dude! You said it was one of a kind! You’re telling me we could’ve just picked one up at the bookstore this whole time?!”

“Hey, that lady told me there was only one. It’s not my fault that she didn’t tell me the truth.”

“Yeah, okay. Where you meet this lady, in a dark alley? Real reputable source you had there.”

“Maybe…” 

“You boys are in luck. I had one left. That’ll be forty-five even.”

“Forty-five dollars?! Why’s it so expensive?” Alex demanded.

“Spell books aren’t cheap, you know. This is on the lower end. You don’t want to know what some of the collector’s items are worth.”

“Whatever. Sam, you’re paying for it anyway. You’re the numbskull who burned the first one.”

“Fine. Here’s the money. Let’s hurry up and get this sorted out. I think I see a crawler on the other side of the street. We’ll meet y’all back at the house.”

We arrived back at Sam’s house and began making our preparations for the ritual. Sam had been proactive and set up everything we needed beforehand in his basement. Candles were littered throughout the room, and in the middle, a faded wooden Ouija board leered at us, begging us to use it.

“Matt, I’m scared,” Sidney whimpered from her spot beside me.

We were all seated in a circle around the board. Alex was strategically placed opposite of Sidney to avoid any more incidents.

“It’s going to be okay. It won’t last more than a few minutes, then we can get out of here. I can sit with you in the car if you don’t feel up to this,” I said, gently rubbing her back.

“No, I’m fine. I can do this.”

“Ooooh, now I get it. You two *like* each other. It all makes sense now,” Alex sneered.

“N-no. I mean, I- um, it-”

“Zip it, bozo,” Jake growled.

Alex instantly averted his gaze.

“Alright, I think we have everything we need. Everyone ready?” Sam asked, claiming his spot at the front of the board.

“Yeah, but this time you’re not reading from the book. Got it?” Alex retorted.

“Fine, Mr. know-it-all. You take it.”

He tossed the book to Alex, who clumsily dropped it. 

“Uh, I’d be afraid to fuck up the pronunciation. How about we have the Spanish wiz take a crack at it?” he said, beaming the book at my chest. 

I caught it and shot him a dirty glare.

“Sure thing. Asshole,” I mumbled.

“Everyone put one hand on the planchette,” Sam ordered.

We did as we were told. I thumbed through the book until I found the incantation I had researched earlier that day. 

“Rey Paimon, demonio de la codicia, te convocamos en nombre de todo lo que es malo.”

The candles flickered and a chill crawled up my spine. I knew the book had done its job. I could feel a presence in the room with us. We weren’t alone.

“I guess we need to determine if it worked. Is anyone here with us?” Sam asked. 

The board immediately shot to ‘yes.’”

“Oh, shit,” Jake muttered.

Sidney and I glanced at each other wide-eyed.

“Is this Paimon?” Sam continued.

*Yes*.

“We, uh, we need you to leave us alone.”

The planchette crawled across the board sickeningly slowly.

*No.*

Alex stared at the board in terror, body trembling. 

Sam locked eyes with me and nodded to the spell book. I continued reading.

“Te desterramos al reino de la oscuridad eterna-” 

The room began to vibrate. The book quivered in my hand as I tried to regain my composure. I glanced up only for a second. Sidney screamed. Standing all around us were dozens of mutilated corpses. Their lifeless eyes bore into us as I read, striking fear into my heart. With each word they shuffled closer. 

“Keep reading!” Sam yelled.

“Toma a tus siervos-”

Alex released a deep guttural shriek as one of the dead dug its rotten claws into his shoulder. I wavered. Sidney placed her free hand on my leg. 

“You can do this.”

Her reassuring words spurred me to continue right as a mangled broken woman reached Jake. 

“y vete para siempre!”

Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted. I opened my eyes, and the room was back to normal. The entities were gone, and I could no longer sense something with us. Alex was still screaming. 

“Goodbye!” Sam yelled as we threw our hands from the planchette all at once. 

“No, no, no!” Alex cried as he kicked the board across the room.

“Alex, dude. Calm down. They’re gone,” Sam said.

“Uh, wha- oh. You’re right. Cool.”

We all stood and began to make our way to the door, shell-shocked from the experience we just had. 

“You did great, Matt,” Sidney whispered. 

“Thanks. I didn’t know if I was going to be able to keep going. Not until I saw one of those freaks heading for you.”

Her cheeks turned bright red. She grinned at me.

“That’s sweet.”

“Thanks for your help. And, uh, sorry for him,” he murmured, out of ear shot of Alex.

“Don’t mention it. Get that little weasel under control, though.”

Alex emerged from the stairs as we were turning to leave. 

“Bye, thanks for the help. And Sidney, I hope to see you around.” 

I whipped around to face him. Time ticked in slow motion as white-hot rage enveloped me from the inside out. I swiftly reached out and snagged Alex’s hand before it made contact with Sidney’s rear. I twisted his arm, nearly snapping the scraggly appendage. I shoved him to the ground and leapt on top of him. I began to beat him relentlessly, fists smacking his face back and forth like a tennis ball. 

“YOU. STUPID. PIECE. OF. FUCKING. SHIT. I. TOLD. YOU. TO. LEAVE. HER. ALONE.”

Each word was met with a furious blow. Jake, Sidney, and Sam all stared at the spectacle, slack jawed. Alex writhed and fought on the floor, begging me to stop. But I didn’t let up. I kept going until his face was a swollen mess of blue, black, and red. Lots of red. 

Once all the anger had drained from my system, I stood, gave Alex one last kick to the gut, and wordlessly walked out the door. Jake and Sidney turned to each other, visages a melting pot of exhilaration and disbelief. The pair promptly followed me out the door, leaving Sam to assist his bloodied friend.

The ride home was a silent one. We got back to the house and awkwardly stood around in the living room. 

“Um, Jake?” I said, eyeing his room.

He took the hint. 

“I, uh, have to go make my bed. I’ll see you guys tomorrow.”

“Hm, that’s weird. Jake never makes his bed,” Sidney remarked.

“Yeah, strange. So, um, I’m really sorry you had to see that. Something in me just snapped. It was disgusting the way he was treating you, and when he almost touched you like that, I…”

Tears began welling in my eyes. Sidney placed a hand on my arm.

“I lost my cool.”

“Matt, it’s okay. That scumbag had it coming. I thought it was sweet of you to stick up for me like you did. It meant a lot, actually. Thank you,” she said, softly kissing me on the cheek.

My face turned red as a beet and a smile inched its way across my face. 

“I’ll see you tomorrow. We should both get some rest. It’s been a long day.”

“You’re right about that,” I said, still grinning from ear to ear, “and start gearing up for another road trip. We’ve got a siren to stop.”
