I first realized that the universe had a sinister plan for me when I turned 25. My family had enjoyed a comfortable middle-class life until my mother fell victim to a terrible illness. Her treatment drained their savings and forced them to sell our family home. I made the difficult decision to drop out of college to support them financially. As I faced the harsh reality of my student loans and uncertain future, I found myself at a crossroads: return to college, bury myself in debt, and work tirelessly for decades, or settle for a dead-end job at Burger King.  
  
  
Feeling lost and overwhelmed, I decided to drown my sorrows in alcohol and called a friend to join me. We ended up at a dingy bar, where I poured out my frustrations to my half-asleep companion. That's when he appeared, a tall man in a well-tailored business suit. I wondered why a wealthy-looking individual was in such a rundown place, but his presence felt strangely comforting.  
  
  
He listened to my woes and offered a solution. "My dear fellow, what a terrible hand fate has dealt you! All that potential greatness, thwarted by illness. It is truly deplorable. But fear not, for I am an unusually powerful man, and I may be able to make your dreams come true! Tell me, my friend, what is it that you desire from life?"  
  
  
In my intoxicated state, I saw an opportunity to vent to someone who seemed to care. The possibility of this stranger turning my life around ignited a glimmer of hope within me. "I want... I want to finish my degree!" I blurted out, my words slightly slurred. "I want to own my own house, with a beautiful garden! I want to earn enough to pay off debts, mortgages, and still have savings for a vacation. I want my parents to enjoy a comfortable retirement!"  
  
  
The tall man smiled, seemingly understanding my deepest desires. "That all sounds quite reasonable, my dear fellow. Who wouldn't want such things? I can certainly make it happen for you. However, I must warn you, there will be a price to pay."  
  
  
"A price?" I questioned, intrigued yet cautious.  
  
  
"Yes, indeed. But don't fret, it's something within your reach. I require ten souls as payment," he replied, his smile unchanging.  
  
  
I frowned, feeling uneasy. "Souls? What do you mean?"  
  
  
He explained that the currency he dealt in was souls, but he promised that the souls I owed would be from wealthy individuals whom I would never know or meet. They would be people born into privilege and wealth, like the offspring of corrupt politicians, influencers, businessmen, and crypto-bros. He even tried to convince me that I could consider it an act of justice, leveling the playing field in some way.  
  
  
Though skeptical, the allure of his offer was too enticing to dismiss outright. "Okay... as long as they're strangers and not innocent people."  
  
  
He eagerly handed me a contract, and I found myself signing it without thinking. The man signed as well, shaking my hand with a strange sense of satisfaction.  
  
  
"Make sure to check your mail tomorrow," he said cryptically before vanishing into thin air. It was as if he had never been there at all. The bartender sneezed, jolting me back to reality, and my friend stirred from his sleep at the bar. There was no trace of the tall man.  
  
  
The next morning, I woke up with a faint memory of the encounter, thinking it must have been a bizarre dream. However, that very day, a letter arrived from Harvard University. I couldn't believe it—I had been offered a full scholarship and more through a program called B. A. A. L. My dreams of finishing my degree and owning a home were suddenly becoming a reality.  
  
  
As the years passed, everything seemed to fall into place. I completed my degree at Harvard, met my soulmate, and landed a high-paying job in my field. Life appeared to be taking a turn for the better, until tragedy struck.  
  
  
My wife and I experienced one heartbreaking loss after another. We suffered through the devastating deaths of our twins, followed by our stillborn daughter. Each pregnancy seemed cursed with rare and inexplicable complications. Our joy turned to sorrow, and our dreams crumbled before our eyes.  
  
  
The grief tore us apart, and our marriage began to crumble under the weight of our shared pain. I couldn't escape the feeling that there was something more to this than mere coincidence. The memories of that mysterious man and his bargain haunted me.  
  
  
One day, consumed by guilt and desperation, I confessed to my wife about the encounter with the tall man and the contract I had signed. She refused to believe it, dismissing it as a delusion born from our shared grief.  
  
  
But I knew it was real. I could feel it in my bones, in the inexplicable tragedies that seemed to haunt our lives. I started seeing that tall man everywhere—in the faces of doctors, acquaintances, and even my therapist. He was always there, lurking in the background, a constant reminder of the price I had unknowingly paid.  
  
  
As my obsession grew, I contemplated unthinkable actions to free myself from this curse. Could killing that man sever my ties to him? Or would it only lead to more suffering? Was there any escape from the darkness that surrounded my life?  
  
  
Haunted by the weight of my actions, I felt trapped in a never-ending nightmare. My soul was burdened with guilt and regret, and I wondered if there would ever be a way to break free from the clutches of that malevolent tall man and the debt of souls I owed.
