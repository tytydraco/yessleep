Dear diary. Hello diary, I am writing in you today about this. 
This is going to sound crazy but it's 100% all true for me

Sep 25th 2005. 

Diary there is a weird barrel in my garage, I did not put it there. I look inside the barrel. Theer was a rat in it. 

A rat was in there 
Rat in barrel

I don't like rats. I took my gun out of the microwave and shot it. The rat. 
I went back to the gun and the rad had wrote in the barrel 
"I'm an evil rat you are cursed

I pissed myself in the Walgreens 


Sep 29th 2005. 

Dear diary,the barrel is back. The rat is inside. He wrote me another mesig 
"I'm cursing you again today, you have ,2 days to solve my riddle 

The rat had wrote the riddle in the barrel. But it was too dark in the garage because it was night (dark outside the barrel)

I couldn't solve the curse 


Sep 30th 2005 

I looked at the barrel today (rat barrel)

The curse had only one day. There was a rat in it. 

I brought my friend Timmy to see the barrel.

"I'm in a wheelchair" Timmy said to the barrel. 


October 3rd 2005 

Timmy is in a wheelchair. 
He has problems with his arms.

I didn't solve the evil rat ridedl in the barrel last week so I couldn't come uncured (non cursed) 

There's 2* barrel now in the garage. My mom left to go groceries and she didn't bring it so how?


Octer 4th 2005.

The rat in the barrel started vibrating when I shook iti think I cured the curse. The rat told me I had diabetes.


October 6th 2005 I went in the garage and there was a rat in it. The rat was hyperrealistiv eyes and bloody smile 

"Your mom is dead", 

I knew she was alive. I just saw her in the kitchen with  groceries and lasagna and bread. 

I knew the rat was a lier. I threw out the barrel outside tje one with the rat in it. 

The evil rat yelled and my heart beating fast. I couldn't feel my arms and feet anymore. And my blood sugar was going up 

My dad yelled from the couch. "Calvin are you ok?"

My dad, logan was a normal guy he would use the bathroom for a long time and was kind of racist toward the Chinese.


I ran in shaking and told him about the rat with the bloody smile. 

My dad eye turned to COMPLETE BLACK. I want and hindsen under my bed covers. 

October 8th 2005

Diary I woke up at MIDNIGHT and went to the rat barrel outside, where I threw it. There was a rat in it. 

I don't like rats as I said. 

The rat told me he cursed my dad and made his eyes black. Suddenly my reflection in the mirror smiled at me! 
 But I didn't smlking. (Smiling) 

The rat told me to defeat him I had to fight the ghost of my dad's reflection. With bloodshot black eyes in the bathroom

I told the rat to fuck off and Timmy and I did whip it's in the arbys bathroom. 


The end?
