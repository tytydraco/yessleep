The attic had been leaking for a few days now, and I had been up to my wits’ end about it. Elizebeth told me to call a contractor, but I knew I was perfectly capable of fixing it. We had been warned that the house would be a fixer-upper, but with a baby on the way and our budgets being tight, I told her that I was up to the task of converting this small country house into our cozy nest that we had always dreamed of. She was mostly on board to get out of the city, and I needed a project to work on at the time.

We have been living here for about two years now, and suddenly, the attic decided to leak. I had fixed most of the electrical and plumbing in the house already, so I assumed that either a critter had gotten up there and the recent rain had come through, or I hadn’t tightened a pipe or sealed it properly. I grabbed my ladder and my toolbox and went up the rickety wooden stairs into the attic.

By all accounts, the attic itself made no sense. The house was a small two-bedroom house with one bathroom, a decent-sized living room, and a small kitchen, as if built to fit into an apartment. The house wasn’t two stories tall: It just had an attic that you could squat in. Why someone who lived in a house this size would need an attic, I have no clue, but I have to admit that it was nice to have.

As I used my flashlight around the stuffy attic, I saw the boxes of holiday decor and baby toys we had been given for Jameson so that he would have some when he got older. Grandparents, am I right? But then I saw something shift behind a wooden horse. I dragged myself up into the attic, and I moved things about as I came closer to the spot. I felt it first, before the smell hit my nostrils. Wet, puffy, wrinkled. The smell of dead things. Things that had been sitting in here for a long time. I swung the flashlight to what my other hand had touched, and that is when I realized what it was.

The eyes had burst from when I shifted my weight onto the hand, the skull flattened, and the neck had an impression of my pinky finger on it. I couldn’t immediately identify it, but from what I could tell, it must have been a really decayed raccoon or cat. What made it even more difficult was the lack of fur or any other identifying features. It seemed to have four legs, but the paws were a little longer, and it had tiny fingers that resembled human hands. The tail seemed malformed, as it looked like it had grown with a bend in it, like an elbow. The end of the tail had some form of claw on the end, but it could have been a malformed bone.

The head was mush, so I’m assuming it was a raccoon. Of course, at the time, I was more concerned about vomiting on my favorite work shirt. I quickly crawled out of the attic and ran into the bathroom to wash off the greasy guts on my left hand and change shirts. I then grabbed a few plastic bags and some gloves from the kitchen before trekking back up there to clean it out.

After a few trips and burning through cleaning supplies, I had removed the dead critter and any fluids up there. My focus was off, as my hand had broken out into hives and sores. Elizebeth told me I should go see the doctor, but I told her I’ll wait a day or two first. As I scrubbed the hives on my hand, I stared at the creature’s hands and tail, how they were twisted with claws as if human. I didn’t tell her about how misshapen the creature was, as the problems of the attic were mine.

I assumed the critter had somehow crawled up the tree in our backyard and found a hole beneath the roof or behind a gutter, but there was no hole to be found. I emptied the attic and searched every nook and cranny. The leak was definitely coming from where the critter’s body had lain, but the attic refused to reveal its exit. It was almost as if the creature had been a plug, but there would still have to be a hole, right? Elizebeth asked me if the leaking could have been the critter pissing on the attic floor, but I told her that the attic only leaked when it had rained, and we would’ve smelled it.

The next day, I had a hard time getting up and continuing the search for the leaking gap. I hadn’t slept well, in all honesty, because I had a really weird dream about something outside the bedroom window calling out a name. It doesn’t matter, though. Dreams are always weird, right? But I do have the name stuck in my head now. I ended up muttering it to myself all day, and I didn’t even realize it until Elizebeth asked me what I was saying. I wasn’t sure myself, and I hadn’t even realized that I was staring out the window while I was muttering.

Two nights ago, things started to change. I had gotten up late that night, waking up from a nightmare, if you must know, and I decided to refill my cup of water. I tiptoed out of the bedroom so as not to wake Elizebeth and went into the kitchen. As I flipped on the light, I almost jumped when I saw a silhouette from the kitchen window. I had just woken up from a dream about something coming in from the window, so you can understand why I was jumpy. I then rubbed my eyes and saw that it was an ooze, leaking from the kitchen ceiling and down the window panel.

Thunder roared, and lightning flashed outside, highlighting the translucent fluid. It couldn’t have been there for more than a few minutes, as the crack in the ceiling looked as if it had only just started taking water damage. I took my empty cup and scooped some of it off the window before it reached the sink, then placed it on the counter. I then spent the next ten minutes digging around for a bucket and a towel as quietly as I could, and cleaned up as much as possible.

Being quite tired from horrible dreams, I absentmindedly grabbed my cup and brought it back to bed with me, thinking I had filled it with water. As the fluid touched my tongue, I realized my mistake, but it was too late. It filled my mouth and ran down my throat as I tried to spit it out. As I gagged and coughed, Elizebeth woke up and asked what was wrong. I told her what happened, and she handed me her water. I ended up going to the bathroom and washing my mouth out for a while before finally falling asleep, exhausted.

I awoke to a sore throat and a grumpy wife. She said that I had been muttering in my sleep all night, something about somebody arriving. I didn’t have a clue what she could have been talking about, so I apologized. After coming home from work, I used my ladder to seal up the cracking ceiling in the kitchen, then went back into the attic.

It felt smaller than before, but a lack of sleep was affecting my senses for most of the day. A coworker had poured some water on my lap to wake me up, as I had fallen asleep muttering, so the dimensions of the attic “feeling off” didn’t concern me. What did concern me was that I couldn’t find the source of the ooze. The only thing that stuck out was that an outline of where the critter had been found had stained the wood flooring, but that was something I couldn’t scrub out. The wife told me I should call pest control or a professional, but I quickly snapped back that I was perfectly capable of fixing anything wrong in the attic, and that I was the only one who could prepare it.

I must have said it more aggressively than I intended, because she said that she was going to take our son with her to her mother’s house, and that I had been acting strange for the past few days. She claimed that I had been sleepwalking, muttering the same name over and over while opening windows at night, and had become distant. I told her it was just nightmares and that I was fine. I was just stressed because I had a job to do, and if she couldn’t understand that, then she should just leave.

I haven’t seen her for two days now. Or our son, Jameson, I think. Not that it matters now. She wouldn’t understand, even if I tried to explain it to her. I love her, but I had to fix the leak. I haven’t left the house since. My boss called, but I told him I had more important things to do than filling out paperwork, then hung up. But I finally found the leak. That damn attic thought it could hide it from me, but I found it.

At this point, my skin is puffy and red, with dried blood from sores and cracked skin across my arms. I haven’t been able to speak; my jaw feels so swollen. Moving or breathing hurts, so I have spent the past few hours sitting in the attic alone. The ooze wasn’t just a leak, but rather a gift. He had tried to tell me before, but I didn’t understand. As his arms crawl within me, I feel brimming with joy. I finally fixed the leak, as I drank what was left of the divine essence. He now dwells within me, reaching out from my throat and peeling away my skin. He has arrived, and we are born again in one form as I am torn apart from the inside, a cocoon for my lord of Shaggai.
