I need to tell you this. I really do need to tell you this.

What do I need to tell you? Well this story of course! 

Why? Because you need to know what exists out there. Out there slightly beyond the boundaries of human existence. 

In the caves. 

In the woods.

Underneath the concrete road which the cars travel on.

When you finish reading this story I hope you remember everything. Remember everything and be careful. Because you really need to protect yourself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will not detail where I am from and where I went. But I exited the city so I can go to my forest cabin out of the state for a week of relaxation in nature.

The journey was quick. And I was a good driver too. In a single day I managed to bypass a huge amount of distance and I was already halfway there. Towards my cabin.

I was surrounded by trees from all sides as I drove on the scorching hot concrete road. The sun giving a warm hug towards everything in 12 pm when I decided to drive 30 feet off road so I could relax and relief myself in the woods.

Once I halted my car I jumped out and locked the doors. I went some 100 feet deeper into the woods so I can pee free from the gaze of the human eye.

I peed and then looked out into the forest for 5 minutes. Admiring the beautiful scenery. I turned around and headed towards my car so I can drive again.

When my car appeared in my sight I did not see anything unusual. But when I tried opening  my car that's where things went scary.

I put my key into the hole and tried opening it.

Nothing.

I tried and tried but I did not hear the sound. Fearful I grabbed the handle and the door swung wildly. 

I did not leave the door unlocked.

I looked inside of the door and noticed that the inside has been completely ripped off.

No locking mechanism. 

No mechanism to keep the door shut.

Nothing.

Sweat started rolling down my forehead.

I jumped into the drivers seat and I tried to start the car.

Nothing. 

The car did not start. 

My heart jumped fast, I flung myself out of the door and opened the car hood.

Everything had been ripped off.

Nothing was left in there.

I took three steps back stunned at what I saw.

During my time in the woods I heard nothing which would indicate car parts being ripped off.

I started looking around and that's when I noticed on my left I saw smoke rising towards the sky.

"Someone is in the woods?" I thought to myself.

I then turned towards the smoke and ran towards it.

I came across a large old looking but strong cabin. And on its porch sat a man who looked like he was in his sixties in a rocking chair.

I ran towards him and when I was 10 feet away I yelled out to him. "Did you destroy my car?"

The old man replied, clearly confused by my question. 

"What?"

I yelled but this time a little bit quieter.

"Parts of my car door were ripped off and I cannot lock it. And when I tried to start the car so I could drive it did not start. And when I opened the hood nothing was there. Did you do it?"

Suddenly chill was in the air and everything seemed to stop. No sounds from the forests were heard and all I felt was my rapid heartbeat. 

The man rose on his feet and said

"Son. Understand this. No human can do what has happened to you. Let me guess you heard no sound of the car parts being ripped off from your car? I will provide lodging for your safety. You do not know what you just came across. Come inside i will explain it to you."

I do not know how to explain it, but I felt honesty and sincere kindness in the man's voice and I felt calmer. I complied and went inside his house.

His house which was made out of the wood looked elegant inside and when I entered he shut the door,locked it and pointed towards a chair and said "sit. I will explain."

I sat on the chair and he took a long hard look at me before he said anything. 

"What you just experienced was the attack of the monster. This monster cannot attack during the day but only during the night. It cannot enter any home and you must be wary when you are outside. Similar thing happened to a man yesterday and I provided lodging to him. He went out 5 hours ago into the forest and has not returned since. He went to reach a town which is 100 miles further down the road."

"Listen to me carefully.  Do not go outside until it is 7 AM when the sun is completely out, and go inside by 6 PM. And you will be safe. "

Those words struck me like lightning. 

I said to him while the fire raged in the furnace.

"I cannot stay here forever. I have to go home!"

He replied 

"And that's why I will make a phone call to my friend."

He then pulled out a brand new iPhone and talked with someone.

He then closed his phone and said to me.

"In a week in 1 PM he will arrive and you will go to your location. Did you bring any stuff? If so let's go to your car and fetch it. You can put it in the basement. Don't worry. It's clean."

I did not say anything and we both went out to my car and brought all my stuff to his basement.

Then he dusted off his hands and said. 

"My name is Jerry. What about yours?"

I then told him my name which I will not disclose here.

During the day nothing happened. It was only when the clock struck  9 AM when I heard the voice of man screaming emanate from the woods.

Me and Jerry ran out of our rooms and watched out of the window a man running out of the woods towards the cabin.

"Is that the monster?" I asked. My question seasoned with fear.

"No that is not the monster." Jerry squinted his eyes. "The thing behind him is the monster."

I stared and saw something which was over 7 feet tall and humanoid looking run after the man. 10 feet behind him.

"We must help him!" I headed for the door and Jerry grabbed my shoulder.

"We can't. That thing is too fast. It will reach him. Watch."

We both watched as the man was only 30 feet away from the cabin as the monster launched itself and landed on top of him. He screamed even louder and the monster tore him into bits. It grabbed his mangled lifeless body and brought him into the woods.

"See? That is why you must be careful. And go in the house by 6 PM. The monster cannot enter this home."

I had no questions except one for Jerry.

"Why do you live here?" I meekly asked him

"To help others." He replied quickly with a tint of confidence in his voice.

I went to bed that night. Thinking over the entire day. I fell asleep quickly.  I was tired.

My pizza has just arrived. I have to go. I will tell you more about Jerry and everything that happened during my stay there in Jerry's home. I am so grateful for Jerry's friend John who drove me back home.
