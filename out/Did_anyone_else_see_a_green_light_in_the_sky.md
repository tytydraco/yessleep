A few nights ago I lost everything, I’m posting my story about what I experienced because I am running out of options. There is an ongoing investigation but the police here are ignoring the facts of what happened! I won’t mention my specific town but I am located in Kansas. If anyone reads my story and can say they saw something similar then please let me know.

Three nights ago I had a hard time getting to sleep. Tossing and turning, I finally reached a point where the dryness of my throat beat out my will to stay asleep. As I forced myself up to get a glass of water I saw that it was only 3:20 am, that was great news to me since it meant I still had a good amount of sleep left before I had to officially get up. I started making my way to the kitchen, making sure all the lights remained off to keep myself in a daze still, but even in the dark I noticed that both my sister and parent’s doors were left wide open. Continuing down the hall I peered inside each room only to find them empty, this was strange but even stranger was around the corner the front door was also left wide open.

Now fully awake and confused I made my way back to my room before seeing if my family were outside, I had to get my hearing aid first. I closed the battery drawer and inserted the device into my ear, but I began hearing a low, unfamiliar humming noise that I simply shrugged off. I made my way to the front door, rushing a bit as my mind started to run wild. As soon as I left through the door my hearing aid began making a screeching noise that stopped me in my tracks, as I recoiled from the sound, I saw that all of my neighbors were standing outside. In a hurry I took my aid off and placed it on the table next to the door as I headed out.

We live in a quiet cul-de-sac, there is a light at the entrance to our street but the lack of it at night is fixed by the lights on our garages and doorsteps. Tonight the entire street was dark and void of any light, the moon being covered by clouds didn't really do our street any favors. In the dark I could still make out people standing around in the street. I only assumed it was our neighbors but after my eyes adjusted a bit, I could also see their front doors left open like our house. As I approached some of my neighbors I tried asking if anyone had seen my family despite it being too dark to read lips, I had hoped that someone would point me in the right direction. I couldn’t seem to get anyone’s attention, almost like they were ignoring me but then I noticed that everyone seemed to be fixated on the sky. When I looked there was nothing to be seen besides a few clouds and a moon trying to make an appearance.

After stumbling around for a bit I started to grow more concerned but then I saw my sister Lisa, just like everyone else she was staring off into the sky. I tried getting her attention by shaking her and forcibly getting her to look at me, but to no avail. I scanned the area looking for our parents but they were not within sight. Suddenly a flash of emerald green coming from up above illuminated our neighborhood, the sudden shift from dark to bright was blinding, but I seemed to be the only one reacting. After taking a moment to adjust, I looked up towards the sky to find the source but could only tell that it came from behind the clouds. I turned to face Lisa and saw that she had tears in her eyes. For the first time tonight someone acknowledged my presence, she looked at me and spoke, I read from her lips “It’s such a beautiful sound.” Then she was gone.

Pulled from my sight, if I blinked then I would have missed it. She was lifted into the sky, accelerating upwards with no sign of slowing down. My eyes were only focused on her, but my peripherals were soon filled with the bodies of my neighbors, joining her towards the lasting green beyond the clouds. Then like a switch the night sky returned to its peaceful state and I was left in the dark, alone.

I went to the police, and local news outlets but there have been no reports of the sky turning green or missing people besides in my neighborhood. No one believes me so I can only reach out to forums now for any information but I’m losing hope that I’ll see my family again. Please if anyone has any info regarding what has happened to me, anything at all, please reach out.
