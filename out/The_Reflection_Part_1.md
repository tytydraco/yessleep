So, here’s a fun fact: your reflection isn’t actually *you*. It’s just an image bouncing off a piece of glass. A reversed, hollow version of yourself. A mockery.

I didn’t used to think about this.

But now I do.

This all started two nights ago, when I was brushing my teeth and noticed something weird.

The reflection was lagging.

Not by a lot. Just a fraction of a second. The kind of thing that makes you stop and squint at yourself like, *Wait, did I just imagine that?*

So I did the logical thing: I tested it. Moved my hand. Tilted my head. The reflection followed, just a beat too slow.

That’s when my brain decided to casually ruin my life by whispering, *What if that’s not your reflection?*

Now, I want to clarify something: I don’t *do* ghosts. I don’t go looking for creepy shit. I’m not one of those people in horror movies who hears a noise in the basement and decides, “Hey, let’s go check that out!” I ignore weird stuff, pretend it didn’t happen, and go on living my life.

So that’s exactly what I did. I turned off the bathroom light, went to bed, and vowed not to think about it again.

That lasted about three hours.

Because at exactly 3:12 a.m., I woke up.

And my bedroom door was open.

Now, this might not sound terrifying to you, but here’s the thing: I don’t leave my bedroom door open. Ever. It’s a rule. A survival instinct. Because everyone knows that when you wake up in the middle of the night and see an open doorway, something is probably standing just outside it.

I lay there, my heart hammering, trying to remember if I had actually closed it.

Then I saw the mirror.

And the reflection.

Standing in the hallway.

Not in bed, where it should have been. No, it was standing. Watching me.

It wasn’t moving. I wasn’t moving. We just had this silent, terrifying standoff, like two cowboys in an old Western, except one of us wasn’t real and the other was probably about to shit himself.

Then the reflection raised a hand.

And it **waved**.

My brain short-circuited. My body decided that instead of screaming, or running, or literally doing anything useful, my best option was to throw the blankets over my head like a five-year-old hiding from the boogeyman.

Eventually, I worked up the courage to peek.

The mirror was normal again. Just me, looking pale and sweaty and on the verge of a full mental breakdown.

At some point, morning came. I spent the entire day *not* thinking about what had happened, which was hard to do considering I was now terrified of my own reflection. But I told myself it had been a nightmare. A bad dream. A trick of the mind.

And that worked.

Until the second night.

I left the bathroom light on this time. Not because I was scared—no, of course not—but because, well… because.

At some point in the night, I woke up again.

The door was open.

The mirror was waiting.

And this time, the reflection wasn’t just standing there.

It was **grinning**.

**I** wasn’t grinning.

Not with that stretched-too-wide, sharp smile that looked like it belonged on something that had never actually had to *be* human before.

The whispering started then.

Not in my head. Not from the hallway.

From the mirror.

I don’t know how to describe it. It was a voice, but not a voice. Like hearing someone speak from underwater. Thick. Gurgling. Wrong.

Then I saw the **fingers**.

They slid out from the edges of the mirror’s frame, one by one. Long. Far too long. And the worst part? They weren’t attached to anything and they just **kept coming.**

That’s when my brain officially checked out. I did what any reasonable person would do in my situation: I flailed blindly for the lamp and knocked half my bedside table onto the floor. When I finally hit the switch, the light came on, and—

The mirror was normal again.

Just me. Looking like I hadn’t slept in weeks. Like I’d seen something I wasn’t supposed to and now the universe was waiting to see what I’d do about it.

But there was something new now.

A handprint on the glass.

Not mine.

I should have packed a bag. Left town. Burned my apartment down, maybe. Instead, I did something incredibly stupid.

I reached out.

I touched the *mirror*.

And something touched back.

It was warm.

That should have been the part where I screamed and ran out the front door. But instead, I just sat there, staring at my own stupid, exhausted face in the glass, like an idiot who just realized he might have started something he didn’t know how to stop.

The handprint was still there.

No big deal, right? A little condensation, maybe? A trick of the light?

Then I noticed something worse.

The print wasn’t fading.

It wasn’t on the glass anymore.

It was on **my** skin.

I’m not going to sleep tonight. Probably not tomorrow, either.

And I think, whatever’s in the mirror, it knows that.
