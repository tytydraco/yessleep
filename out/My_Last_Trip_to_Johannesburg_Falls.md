I woke up that Saturday morning with a thrill of excitement. After a long week, I was finally headed to Johannesburg Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in Washington and my favorite escape. As I dressed and brushed my teeth, Shiloh, my 8-year-old beagle/dachshund mix, wagged her tail, eager to join the adventure.

The drive was over two hours, mostly uneventful. Shiloh whined in the backseat, her seatbelt a frustrating barrier. I immersed myself in a new horror podcast, darker and bloodier than I was used to, the unsettling sounds fueling my excitement. I felt a twinge of annoyance when the signal dropped, but I shrugged it off.

After an agonizingly bumpy ride up a gravel road riddled with potholes, I finally reached the dead-end parking lot filled with maybe 10 or so cars. To my disappointment, a barrier blocked the road ahead. No way had I driven this far to be turned away. Determined, I decided to hike the remaining mile to the falls, hoping to see the towering water cascade in all its glory.

The hike was grueling—uphill the entire way. I passed an elderly couple with hiking sticks; the old man chuckled, “You’re lucky you have a dog to pull you up this hill.” I laughed back, but unease began to creep in. The falls were to our left, but as I paused for photos, I realized how quiet it had become.

Shiloh lagged behind, panting heavily. It was hotter than I had anticipated, and I hadn’t brought any water. A knot of worry tightened in my stomach as I wondered if bears lurked in the shadows. The thought sent my heart racing. Where were all the other hikers?

I stopped to let Shiloh drink from a shallow portion of the river and then decided to turn back, feeling a wave of panic wash over me. Alone in the woods with no cell service, I could only imagine how long it would take for anyone to notice I was missing. We retraced our steps, the river’s rushing sound eerie in the thick silence.

The paranoia deepened. Where was the old couple? I felt eyes on me, the sensation crawling along my skin. I began to run, glancing back at the twisted trees and rocks, feeling the weight of unseen eyes.

Finally, I rounded the curve and skidded to a halt.

Not a single car was in the parking lot.

My heart raced as confusion turned to dread. Had I lost my way? I pressed on, hoping to find someone, anyone. We hiked another mile down the hill, but the oppressive silence gnawed at my sanity. Shiloh seemed oblivious, just panting from the heat, but I felt something was terribly wrong.

I turned back towards the river to let Shiloh drink again. The cold water was a brief relief, but I was haunted by the emptiness surrounding us. I looked at my phone—1:30 PM. I had parked hours ago; that couldn’t be right.

I felt the weight of the forest pressing in, silence swallowing the world around me. I started up the hill, but everything felt off, as if reality had shifted. The river next to me murmured unnaturally, and fear twisted in my gut. I ran.

When I reached the top, my breath hitched in my throat.

There was no one there.

Panic clawed at my chest. I dashed into the women’s restroom, taking Shiloh with me. Locking the door, I tried to catch my breath. My phone still read 1:30. I checked my photos timestamps—1 PM. Time had warped.

The bathroom felt suffocating, the air thick and stale, wrapping around me like a heavy shroud. I could hear the faint echo of Shiloh’s growls, a low rumble of instinctual fear that resonated in the stillness. My heart raced, and an unshakeable dread crawled up my spine, prickling my skin as if unseen eyes were probing the dim corners of the room.

I turned slowly, scanning the cramped space. The fluorescent light flickered, casting shadows that danced unnaturally on the walls. In that moment, a chill gripped me, a premonition of something lurking just beyond the thin barrier of the door.

I hesitated, my breath hitching in my throat. I opened the door ever so slightly and my blood ran cold.

A figure loomed just outside the door, impossibly tall and unnervingly thin. Its limbs were grotesquely elongated, each joint twisted and gnarled in ways that defied human anatomy. The darkness around it seemed to warp and shudder, as if reality struggled to contain its presence.

Burning yellow eyes pierced through the dim light, fixated on me with a predatory intensity. Those eyes—soulless and ancient—held a dreadful promise, as if they could see through to the very essence of my being. The edges of its form flickered like a mirage, bending the light around it in a way that made my mind ache.

I opened my mouth to scream, but the sound froze in my throat, smothered by the weight of terror that pressed down on me. It was as if the very air had thickened, swallowing my voice. Shiloh’s growl escalated into frantic barks, her fur bristling like a warning signal. I felt the primal instinct to flee, but my legs felt rooted to the ground.

In a desperate rush, I slammed the door shut, fumbling with the lock as my hands trembled violently. The metal felt cold against my fingers, a stark contrast to the heat of my racing heart. I backed into the corner, my breaths coming in shallow gasps, tears streaming down my face as I silently sobbed.

Each second stretched into eternity, time becoming a cruel joke as I listened to Shiloh’s barking reverberate off the walls, a fierce but futile attempt to ward off the darkness. My mind raced with horrifying possibilities—what if it follows me inside? What if it could slip through the cracks of reality?

I pressed myself against the wall, feeling the cool tiles against my back, a fragile barrier between me and the unknown. The silence outside felt oppressive, heavy with anticipation. I strained to hear, but all I could sense was the weight of something waiting, watching, lurking just beyond my door. I could almost feel its breath, hot and rancid, ghosting over the threshold.

My heart pounded, each beat echoing in my ears like a death knell. I didn’t know if it was still out there, waiting for the moment I dared to move, or if it had simply vanished into the shadows, plotting its next move. The dread coiled tighter, and I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping that when I opened them again, it would all be gone.

But the terror remained, a living thing, and I was just a trapped animal, waiting for whatever horror awaited me.

At some point, I lost consciousness.

I jolted awake to loud knocking. “Hello? Is anyone in here?” a woman’s voice called. I stood shakily, glancing at my phone: 6:30 PM. What happened?

I opened the door a crack. Outside stood a middle-aged woman with a frown. I stepped out, my heart pounding. Dozens of hikers surrounded me, the sun hanging low in the sky, the air cooler.

I stumbled down the hill, bewildered. The curve loomed ahead—the one that had led to my car. I ducked under the barrier, dread pooling in my stomach.

There it was—my car, just as I had left it. Sobbing, I hurriedly put Shiloh in the backseat and sped down the mountain, potholes be damned.

When I finally got service, I called my fiance. “Where have you been?” he asked, concern lacing his voice. “You’ve been gone for like six hours.”

Tears streamed down my face as I promised to be home soon.

That night, I collapsed into bed, exhausted and haunted. I still don’t understand what happened at Johannesburg Falls. The image of that figure haunts my dreams. I fear I may never return to that place—or to the shadows that lurk just beyond the light.
