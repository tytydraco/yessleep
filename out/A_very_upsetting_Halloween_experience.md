This was a long time ago, and no one would believe me if I posted this in r/creepyencounters or some shit, so here I am posting on a fiction subreddit. This is a straight up true story, but feel free to not believe it because it sounds fake as fuck. 

I was a junior in high school. A bit of background: My friend’s mom worked at a daycare that was being renovated. They were in a new building right next to the old building, and everyone working there swore that the old building was haunted. Vaguely weird shit kept happening, and there was the cold drafts and all that haunted shit. Everyone had seen some dude in a cowboy hat who definitely didn’t exist. My friend’s mom even had a video of the creepiest child/thing ever peeking out of a window of the old building. One of her toddlers kept talking and waving to this empty window, and the window wasn’t fucking empty. 

Anyway. We were really into “playing” Ouija board at that point. I don’t give a shit what your personal beliefs are, some weird shit happened. Anyway, we decided that Halloween was the perfect time to break into a fucking haunted daycare at 2am on Halloween night with our fucking Ouija board.

We used a key and walked up in this place. There were still toys in the rooms. I was dressed as a rainbow fairy with a fucking sparkly tutu. Everything was creepy in that sort of way where it shouldn’t really be creepy but it is, and there was no music, so none of us knew to run away.

We whipped out our Ouija board and started going at it. We met a kid named Ethan, who seemed afraid to talk to us. Everyone was jumpy as fuck because it’s an old, anecdotally haunted building, and we were a bunch of teenagers.

We also had a camera set up facing down a hallway, because catching creepy shit on camera is neat.

It was pretty windy, because where we lived was always windy, so there were all of the expected creaks and groans and whatnot. There were also bad sounds within the house but whatever.

Btw, it was an old mobile home. Basically a fucking trailer with a washer and dryer by the front door. (I’m setting the scene, but this is also very relevant.)

Everything was groaning and creaking and whatnot, and Ethan was a sketchy little fuck. We heard some weird creaking sounds, and then we heard a door slam. Yeah, it could’ve been a random thing that houses do, but it probably wasn’t. 

We heard the door slam at the same time that our delightful haunted guest started using the Ouija board to count down from 9-1. Apparently that’s a very bad sign. Idgaf if you guys think this is fake; Ouija boards seem really fake until they don’t. No one was counting down, one of us was crying. My friend said “Goodbye,” because basically if someone starts sneaking up on you from the endless darkness and counting down like your fuckin mom when you won’t get out of the treehouse, you tell them to fuck off. 

Overall, everyone was having a terrible time, and the door slam was fuckin upsetting, so we decided to get the fuck out of there. 

The friend who’d set up the camera went to grab it and froze like a statue. He was like “holy shit guys look at this right now.” There was a fucking red child’s ball in the center of the hallway. Like the kind that you’ve seen in any horror movie ever. The one where you’re like “what the fuck is that supposed to be used for, no one can hit that with a bat and they’re probably not using it for physical therapy; why does it exist?”

Everyone was getting the fuck out of there at that point, and my best friend and I were bringing up the rear. I remember we were kind of holding onto each other, and we both heard a creaking sound. We turned around, and a closet door that had been open the whole time was swinging shut. Like, slowly and deliberately. No wind or whatever in this bullshit trailer, it was just closing, slowly. It latched. Like it didn’t just close, it gently latched. 

I remember that we were standing there, watching, clutching each other. Everything got really spicy and full of adrenaline and blurry soon after. 

My most vivid memory was of me holding him with my hand on his chest, watching the door swing shut, and feeling his heart start to race. Feeling him go from the average “hmm I’m stressed” to heart pounding terror. That was really bad.

We started hustling to the door because fuck that shit, but the washer/dryer setup was right by the door, and one of our other friends, who wasn’t extremely creeped out, jumped out from behind the dryer. I screamed and almost shit myself, then we were laughing and my bff was slapping the other dude.

And then, something ROARED at us. I can’t describe the sound, other than it sounded like it was coming from the depths of hell, and it was inside the house. There was no one else inside the house, we were the last ones in there. We fucking took off, and that was the blurry part. I ran across the yard and vaulted the fence, and made it to the car. I remember my dumbass friend who spooked us didn’t show up as fast and I was crying and screaming “where is ____?!?!” He showed up, and we hauled ass out of there in my minivan. 

We stopped in a well-lit parking lot and looked at the footage of the hallway. I swear on my mother’s grave, one of the doors cracked open, and that dumbass red horror movie ball rolled out and settled in the exact middle of the fucking hallway. Then, a closet door slammed shut. That’s the point where all of us decided to clear out. But like, we had fucking footage of that little red ball rolling out of an empty room into the hallway.

So yeah, fun Halloween turns into gut wrenching terror, yeehaw 

As a side note, I drove home to mom and dad and immediately had an allergic reaction. Like, hives and mouth swelling so bad they drove me to the ER in case my throat was next. I carried an Epipen for like three years but nothing ever happened, so I’m probably allergic to ghosts or some shit because none of those toddlers had issues in that building. 

Fun fact, we drove by that place again and the fence I vaulted over was like five feet tall, adrenaline is a hell of a drug.

Have fun sleeping y’all, because I didn’t for like three days
