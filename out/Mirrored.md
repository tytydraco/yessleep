The basement door had been nailed shut for as long as I could remember. Dad never let me near it, not even when I was small and curious, not even when the power went out and I asked why we couldn’t use the breaker. “Some doors are meant to stay shut,” he’d say, eyes hard, jaw working like the words tasted bitter. It was the kind of answer that left no room for questions, but that didn’t stop the door from living in the back of my mind. It had a weight, like the silence before thunder. I had always been a different child, I had been diagnosed with OCD and ADD. 

I’d nearly forgotten about it until the knocking started. It was faint at first, tucked into the rattle of the pipes and the settling of the old house. I was already so busy from both my vocal lessons and school. I hated my parents for forcing me to sing, but i knew it could be good for me one day. One night, while lying in bed exhausted from my vocal lessons. From the window open to the crickets, I heard it plain as day: three sharp raps, patient, deliberate. I froze, heart pounding, and waited. Then came another three. The sound rose from the floorboards beneath me, directly above the basement. When I crept into the hall, Dad was standing in the shadows, staring at the door. His lips moved without sound. When he finally noticed me, his face drained. “Go back to bed,” he said. His voice cracked in a way I’d never heard before.

The next morning, Dad avoided me. He left early, came back late, moved through the house like a ghost. But the knocking grew bolder. It wasn’t random anymore it had rhythm, almost like words trying to form. And then, one night, I heard it: my name. Whispered low, but not by a stranger’s tongue. It was my voice. Perfectly mine, just worn thinner, stretched tighter. “Come down,” it said. I didn’t sleep that night.

By the time the door finally opened, the nails were already gone, lined up in neat rows on the floor as if someone had carefully removed them one by one. The door itself sagged on its hinges, wide enough to leak a stream of air from below. It smelled like iron and rain-soaked dirt, sharp and old, like something buried too long. I shouldn’t have stepped closer, but the air felt warmer near the gap, almost like breath. That was when I heard it again: “Please.” My voice, desperate this time. It didn’t come from behind the door it came up the stairs.

I took the first step down, then another, each creak of the wood like a warning swallowed by the door, open cans of beans and dog food lay scattered across the floor. The lantern at the bottom was already lit, waiting. Shadows bent around the old furnace, and in the corner sat a figure. For a moment, I thought it was a stranger in worn clothes. Then it looked up, My stomach twisted. It wasn’t just familiar, it was exact. My face, older, lined with exhaustion I hadn’t lived yet. The person smiled, a cracked imitation of my own, and whispered in a voice that was mine but heavier, “I got stuck.” He leapt toward me, choking me with arms strangely familiar but uncanny in a way. He secured me with strips of his coat organized in a particular way only someone with OCD would, they were put about 1 inch apart on the ground in a strange semicircle. Once I was unfortunately tied up he resecured the door by wedging a loose piece of wood sanded down by repetitive scraping along the concrete wall. The man sat down on the third stair from the top and watched me, he just stood there unblinking and observing, it must have been hours until he moved. No matter how much I screamed for help, no noise came out, I had worked my vocal cords too much that day at choir practice. After hours of nervous, anxious, waiting he pulled out a piece of glass wrapped in cloth at the bottom and held it up to his throat, he mumbled “I can’t tell you much, it will cause a lot of pain for a lot of people.” “I know you don’t want to make this sacrifice but I had no choice, neither do you.” He slit his throat. And slumped to the cold hard ground.
