That damn Saint Joseph statue. Thinking back to it, and god knows I’ve had so many years to think back to it, it was the Saint Joseph thing that changed my wife. It had to be. 

My darling wife Cecilia. So beautiful, with long black-brown hair with a hint of wave, parted straight down the middle, and intense black eyes. Our lovely daughter Holly, now a precocious teen, looks like just her, the spitting image, except with bright blue eyes, just as intense.  

Holly was always so forward, walking and talking well before her age. She was only five when all of this happened. Only five, about to start school. And my wife had her heart set on her getting into one particular “good” school. She couldn’t stop talking about it- Holly's chances, how well we did at the interview, how it would set up Holly for life- a great university, great career- “Cecilia - sweetheart- please stop! She’s only five! How can this affect her so much?” I remember pleading with her. Her eyes flashed at me- “How do you not understand- with Holly’s talent- don't you care-”  

I had never seen her so pressed before. She usually was a calm, gentle woman, qualities which had drawn me to her in the first place. But Holly’s future schooling seemed to have awaken the mama bear in her.   

Then her mother came over with that statue. Bustling and chattering, she told Cecilia to calm down, Saint Joseph would fix it all. I watched with disbelief as my mother-in-law took a little garden shovel, dug a hole right in our front lawn, in full view of the neighbours, placed the cheap-looking unremarkable small statue in the hole, and covered it back up, leaving a mound of earth in our nice green lawn which was my pride and joy. I turned to Cecilia, who to her credit looked somewhat abashed. “What the hell- your mother- has she gone fully insane?” 

“Oh darling, it’s just an old Catholic thing- don't let it bother you-” she said. Her mother came in, wiping her hands. “There you go my love, Saint Joseph will sort you out and make sure little Holly goes where she’s supposed to go. You’ll stop fretting now won’t you?” and she bent and kissed Cecilia on the forehead.  

I said nothing. This was the first time I became acutely aware of the Catholicism in my wife’s family, placed on full display. Cecilia herself was not practicing, I’d never seen any bibles or crosses around our place, our wedding had been routine, as far as I remember- she showed up looking like a snow princess in a gorgeous white floofy dress, and a priest married us in a church and that was it. Once in a while her mother would say something Jesus-y, and Cecilia would say “oh mom” and roll her eyes- I wouldn’t get into it.  

I wasn’t getting into it now. Shaking my head, I got up and went into the kitchen- we were having friends over for dinner that night, and I was responsible for the meat.  

The dinner went fantastically. Our food was amazing, as it always was in those days, Cecilia and I having a natural  synergy together, the wine was flowing freely- until it wasn’t. I grasped a bottle, and it was empty. 

I shook it futilely into my glass. A drop of red liquid trickled out. I turned with surprise to Cecilia, who seemed to find it hilarious and collapsed into wine-fused laughter. “Did you forget to pick up wine?” I said.  

“Darling I thought you were stopping at the liquor store after dropping Holly off at her dance class!” She rolled her eyes at Becca, our friend sitting next to her. “Can’t trust men with anything can you!” she exclaimed, mock angry. “Here, give the bottle” 

She took the empty bottle from me, and began pouring wine into my glass.  

I blinked. The bottle had been empty, I know it had been. I had had a glass or two, I’ll freely admit it, *but I know it was empty*! 

“What are you on about- this bottle is more than half full!” She waved it at Becca. “Want some?” and without waiting for an answer, she filled Becca’s glass.  

A burst of raucous laughter of our guests distracted me. I sucked on the wine, a beautiful full-bodied red, and pushed down the fear and confusion inching into my heart. Becca and Cecilia were in some deep conversation. I stayed quiet.  

I can’t remember if the bath thing was the next day or even the next week after the dinner party- but it can’t have been much more than that. The school situation was being sorted out, and Cecilia seemed back to her calm lovely self. Nothing was mentioned about Saint Joseph anymore.  

It was early evening, and Cecilia had taken Holly for her bedtime bath. We had a really nice big tub in that house, and I could hear them splashing about. I was lounging in our bedroom, hoping Holly wouldn’t be too difficult about bedtime. I idly swiped my phone, Holly’s high-pitched voice going on about duckies and Cecilia singing, and I remember so clearly the full swell of love and joy for my wife and daughter brimming up in me. 

Then Holly’s voice came through quite clearly “Mommy, I want to do that! I want to stand on the foam!” 

What was she talking about? I dropped the phone. Cecilia said something, much lower. “Me Mommy! Me too!” cried Holly.  

I went to the bathroom. “Pull me up Mommy!” Holly was practically shrieking with excitement. I opened the door and went in. It was full of steam. Then the steam cleared, and I saw. 

Cecilia was standing on the foamy warm bath water. Fully naked, her wet hair, jet-black, streaming down her flushed pink-scarlet skin, she was standing, upright. Her eyes were glowing at Holly who was reaching up, frantically trying to stand with her, without success. I saw Cecilia’s toes, the nails painted scarlet poking through the sweet-smelling bath foam.  

“Daddy, I want to stand like Mommy!” cried Holly.  

I was frozen, I couldn’t move. Cecilia turned to me and smiled, gently lowering herself into the water.  

I opened my mouth but no words came out. Holly was talking too loudly and her shrill voice seemed to pierce through my brain.  

I threw myself out of the bathroom and shut the door behind me. For some reason I was panting hard. I knew I was feeling pure terror, like I never had before. My heart seemed to be jumping about and I thought I was going to die.  

I didn’t die. After a few seconds, I went to our bedroom, and waited.  

Cecilia put Holly to bed and soon joined me. She smelled warm and wonderful, and part of me just wanted to pull her close and simply inhale her loveliness. But I had to say something.  

“No you don’t” she said. I gasped, and looked at her desperately. She came close up to me, and laid her finger on my lips. “You don’t have to say anything. I love you, and you love me, and we both love Holly. That’s all that matters. Come, come to bed.” She took my hand and led me to bed.  

I still think of that night as the most amazing night I have ever had. I have never had any sexual experience, before or since, that even remotely compares.  

The next morning, I woke up groggily, my mind still clouded from the night before. I blinked, and when I closed my eyes I saw on an image of Cecilia, naked and wet, standing on bath foam, Holly reaching up to her. I opened my eyes. I could hear their voices- from the garden. They were playing ball.   

I pulled on my dressing gown, and went down to them. The sun was streaming in my eyes, and I was dazzled. I could make out Cecilia throwing the ball, Holly reaching out, and missing it. The ball bounced on the grass, up over our low fence, and onto the street.  

Small children are so quick. As I walked up to them, shielding my eyes, Holly dashed like a mad rabbit, out of the gate which for some reason was left open. “Holly- no!” I heard Cecilia cry and almost at the same instant I heard the horrible shriek of brakes and a childish scream cut short.  

Cecilia and I stared at each other, held in a fear too great to describe.  

Then the paralysis broke free and we both rushed into the street.  

Holly was lying on the ground, broken in a widening pool of blood under the front car wheels. The driver seemed paralysed, sitting rigid behind the steering wheel, unmoving. Cecilia gave a terrible scream and threw herself on Holly’s still, crooked body. People were gathering around but i couldn’t hear anything, it was as if big waves of silence were deafening me. The world seemed to settle on Cecilia and Holly.  

And then, I saw it. Holly’s foot, stretched out from beneath Cecilia’s body, twitched.  

Slowly, Cecilia rose. Holly’s eyelashes fluttered against her pale cheek, and then she opened them, bright blue, staring straight her mother. “Mommy?” she said and sat up, unharmed. She turned to me. “Daddy?” She lifted her arms to me.  

A gasp of relief rippled through the small crowd. I found myself breathing, almost laughing. I bent and picked up my daughter.  

And then, I caught sight of the driver. He was staring straight at Cecilia, I will never forget that look.  

I still wake up from nightmares, remembering that terrible look, as he lifted his foot from the brake, and then pressing hard again, this time down on the accelarator, turning the wheel towards Cecilia.  

Another cry went up- my voice, Cecilia’s, the crowd, as the driver mowed her down mercilessly. We scattered back, I held Holly’s face tightly against my chest, shielding her from seeing her mother’s murder in broad daylight.  

Cecilia fell where Holly had been lying a few seconds ago.  The impact seemed to shake the earth. The driver slammed the gear in reverse, running back over her body. I heard the crunch, and the mother and daughter’s blood mingled on the grey street. I could hear a woman sobbing close to me.  

\*\*\* 

He will spend life in prison for what he did. To this day, he has no explanation, other than saying that he realised Cecilia was unnatural and had to be killed before she caused any more damage. His defense brought in a psychologist who tried to argue that the trauma of thinking he had killed a little girl must have momentarily unbalanced him. He screamed that the girl was dead and should have remained dead. I left the courtroom, and never returned. Better save my energy on being a good dad to Holly.  

I dug up the statue and gave it back to my poor mother-in-law. She was so overcome with grief that she didn’t seem to notice. I didn’t see much of her after Cecilia’s death anyway.  

Our days pass quietly, Holly and I. I have never remarried- no-one can compare with my darling Cecilia. One day maybe I will be reunited with her, and until then, I will enjoy the company of my lovely daughter.
