First time on Reddit and I wont add too much details.
It was a "dream" I had this morning, no joke, I had this before I woke up.
In the dream I was randomly talking to people which should have been a red flag (painfully shy).
Anyway I can't remember their faces, but there were five of them just staring and talking to me.


Wait, I don't think they had faces.
I'm not a lucid dreamer so I couldn't tell something was off.
Then one of them who looked like the leader pointed to me and everyone looked.
For some reason I saw my own face (in the dream, yeah) and my left eye did a 180Â° spin.
Y'know that thing you see on zombies when their eyes pop out? The thing connecting the eye to the brain? That string thingy... I don't know the name so forgive me.


Anyway it had cut off, not sure how, I wasn't injured, and I just realized I wasn't wearing my glasses which are a MUST for me to live.
Anyway it spun around and I saw the back of my eye, it was completely black, like a void.
I'm not sure how, but I twisted it back into place and we continued talking.
Then about a minute later, the eye spun again.
This time I shone my flashlight at it, and I couldn't see anything, no blood, no signs it was an eye.


It kept going on until I think the fifth time a doctor appeared in front of me.
He stuck his hand into my eye and brought it out, there was no blood, no pain, no hesitation, he just stuck his index and thumb in and gently yanked it out, I didn't have a say, I'm not even sure how he got there, I didn't call anyone, I wasn't in pain, I was surprisingly comfortable, remembering it now, this story gives me shivers. Anyway he walked over to my parents completely ignoring me and said "Her eye is badly decomposed, there's nothing we can do about it I'm so sorry, we can probably just rip it out (he already had, not sure what he meant by that)" And I think I heard someone cry.


No one screamed or caused a scene, there were just hundreds of people gathered and listening to him talk.
I'm sure they didn't know what they were doing either?
Only his voice was heard, his voice was soft and almost a whisper but somehow everyone could hear him clearly.
Now i understand what those creepypasta stories meant.


My other eye was still good.
Then the doctor peeled back a layer of the eye still in his hand and I saw (heaven knows how) that my iris had completely vanished from it's true form.
Instead I saw tiny dots of what used to be my brown iris and there were even some blacks too.


It separated into thousands of tiny dots and the eye wasn't so white anymore.
He opened it and showed to everyone how my eye had decomposed while still in my head.
The doctor didn't fix my eye, no medications, no one even knew I was there.
I think I even shrunk.


Everyone was just so much bigger than me.
They just left and I stood there, just staring...
At this point I think i knew it was a dream, I wanted to scream, but before I could...


 I woke up.
They say dreams have meaning, but I can't tell what this should mean.
It was scary that my left eye was irritated when I woke up and it was reddish...
