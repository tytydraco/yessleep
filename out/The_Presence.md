I woke up to the sound of breathing.  
Not mine.

The kind of breathing that doesn’t belong in your bedroom—the kind that’s too slow, too wet, too deliberate. At first, I thought it was a dream, the tail end of some nightmare I couldn’t remember. But then it kept going.

Inhale.  
Exhale.  
Just a few feet away.

The room was too dark to see anything. My apartment wasn’t supposed to be *this* dark. Normally the orange glow from the streetlamp leaked through the blinds, drawing faint lines across the ceiling. Tonight, nothing. Just black.

I didn’t move. Not even a twitch. My phone was on the nightstand, inches from my hand, but the thought of reaching for it made my stomach twist. If something was in here with me, moving might give me away.

Then—silence.

The breathing stopped. The kind of silence that makes your skin crawl, because it’s too heavy, too intentional. I started to think maybe I had imagined it. Maybe I was still half-asleep. Maybe the pipes were groaning or the building settling—

*“I know you’re awake.”*

The whisper was right at my ear.

I shot up, clutching at the nightstand, but my phone wouldn’t turn on. Black screen. Dead. My eyes darted to the doorway, but there was no doorway. No window either. No faint glow from the streetlamp. Just solid black pressing in from every direction, like the room had been erased.

I wasn’t in my apartment anymore.

The air was damp. Heavy. It reeked of rot, of something sweet and spoiled. My lungs resisted every breath. And underneath it all, faint but steady, I could hear that same breathing—circling.

I tried to call out, but my voice cracked into the dark. The sound didn’t echo. It just died, swallowed instantly, as though the room itself refused to carry it.

Then, faintly, a shuffle.  
The sound of bare feet dragging across the floor.

I backed away until my shoulders pressed against something. It wasn’t my wall. It pulsed beneath my skin—warm, uneven, like the inside of something alive. My stomach dropped.

The breathing grew louder. Closer. It was circling me, though I couldn’t see it. My pulse was so loud I almost missed the new sound—something clicking, like fingernails tapping against the floor. Or maybe claws.

*“Don’t move,”* it whispered again, the words thick and broken, like its mouth wasn’t meant for speech.

I froze.

I could feel it now. Hot breath against my cheek, sticky moisture brushing my skin. My body screamed to run, to fight, to *do something*—but I didn’t move. I couldn’t.

Then, the thing *laughed*. Not loud, not manic, but low and bubbling, like air escaping a corpse underwater.

And the walls began to close in.

The pulsing behind me pressed harder, closing around my arms, my legs, pulling me into the dark. My chest tightened, crushed by something I couldn’t fight. The last thing I saw—if you could call it seeing—was the faintest shape in the dark. Not a face. Not a person. Just teeth.

And then—nothing.

I woke up screaming in my bed.

The streetlight glow was back on the ceiling. My phone lit up when I touched it. The door was where it should be. Everything normal.

Except for the damp handprint on my nightstand...
