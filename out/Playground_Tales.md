"And when she came out of the bathroom, her entire class was gone. The third-grade class of 77 was never seen again, but they say, sometimes, you can still hear laughter in the woods outside the,"

The door opened and we all covered our eyes as Reggy grinned in at us.

"I knew you guys would be telling stories again. You should have waited."

Becky sighed, Randal chuffed unhappily, and I tried to smile as I told Reggy to close the door before someone saw him. We were in the old equipment storage by the play field, and if an adult saw us they would make us get out.

We liked to tell scary stories, and the scarier the locale, the better. The old equipment shed had been unanimously decided upon because it was A. home to a lot of creepy crawlies, and B. Didn't let in a lot of light. We had to keep finding new places to tell stories because the ones we had got old pretty quickly. You can only tell stories in a place for so long before it stops being scary, but sometimes it was because the teachers chased us out. The third reason was stepping in right now and grinning like a shot fox at us.

Reggy, the weird kid of PS 24, had earned his title honestly. It wasn't just because he was overweight to the point of being a blob, and it wasn't just because his hair was always full of thick, gross-looking dandruff. It wasn't just because his Dad was the school janitor and seemed to love the job, or because he ate sauerkraut and onion sandwiches for lunch. The reason was that Reggy just emanated an aura of unsettledness. I got the feeling about him that I got about certain adults or dogs, the ones your parents tell you to stay away from.

Reggy had a feeling of danger, of not rightness about him, and it made me uneasy.

It didn't help that he had adopted us as his "best friends" this year. Becky, Randal, and I had been friends since Kindergarten, but we had managed to avoid getting too close to Reggy. That had lasted until fourth grade when we were in Mr. Novak's class together. Reggy had decided that we were his best friends, he didn't have any regular friends, and he adopted us as His. This led to a year of smelling his sandwiches at lunch, having him follow us on our playground games, and listening to his wheezy resting breaths as he sat in our pod in class.

We had hoped we would be rid of him at the end of the year, but when our parents had signed us up for Summer School Care, a kind of after-school care during the summer, we had groaned as Reggy came in and saw us. He explained that the school had agreed to let him attend for free if his Daddy worked through the summer, and we all prayed that he would be in a different fifth-grade class than us when the new year rolled around.

"Well, since you're already telling stories, I've got a good one." Reggy said, "It's the tale of the skinned raccoon."

Reggy started to lay out this story about a skinned raccoon that he had seen one evening while his Dad worked late, and we all tried to pretend that it wasn't the most gruesome thing we had ever heard. The way he described the raccoon made me think he had not only really seen it, but that he had probably skinned it himself. He said it had left little red footprints on the floor as it walked away, and his father had been angry when he found them.

"We followed them all the way to the woods," he told us, "but we never did find the raccoon."

We all made the appropriately scared noises, but I think we were all just hoping he would let us move on.  

When Mrs. Simmon pushed the door open a moment later, telling us this was off-limits and we needed to leave, it was almost a relief.

We left the shed, trying to kind of lose Reggy as we did, but we knew he'd find us again.

It was impossible to hide from Reggy, he knew everywhere and everything about the school and all the hidden little nooks and crannies. His Dad had keys to any door in the school, and Reggy often borrowed some of them and got into places he shouldn't. His Dad always covered for him, for some reason, so he never got in any real trouble. It's weird, it was like his Dad was scared of him sometimes, but he was a grown-up and there was no reason he should have been afraid of him.

As we left the shed, running into the sunshine of a triple-digit day, Reggy said something that caught my interest.

"That's a shame, I was going to tell you guys about how I saw the missing kids a few nights ago."

The missing kids!

That was a big topic of discussion these days.

Last year, four kids had gone missing from PS 24, a first grader, Marry Edwards, A third grader, George Tate, a Kindergartener, Savanaha Marcus, and a Fifth grader, Robbie Fust. They had come to school and then just never left. The cameras at the school left a lot to be desired, that's what my Dad said, and they hadn't seen the kids leave school by any of the other exits either. My Dad works for the police department and he told me I needed to be extra safe until they found whoever was doing this. They suspected a teacher, but the question was how would they get the kids out? If they were hidden in the school somewhere then they would have found them by now, they had searched the school a bunch. The disappearance hung around the schools like ghosts, and it sounded like the teachers were afraid that they might lose their jobs if it kept happening.

I thought about what he had said until after lunch and decided I would just have to ask him.

We were playing outside, the day a little cooler now that the sun was heading towards down, and Reggy was leaning against the fence and watching people as he often did. Reggy liked to just sit there and look at people, watching them as they went past, but he didn't makeup stories about them or anything. He just watched them like the animals in the zoo watched fat children, and it was really weird.

"So, Reggy," I said, and Becky and Randal looked surprised since we never really talked to him and just accepted when he talked at us, "What did you mean that you were going to tell us about the missing kids?"

Reggy turned his gaze away from a first grader who was chasing a ball with some effort, and his grin was downright predatory, "Oh yeah. I saw them the other night when Dad was working late."

"Like, you saw them saw them?" I said, "Like you know where they are?"

"Well yeah," Reggy said, "They're under the school."

I looked at Becky and Randal, the two of them now as invested as I was, "Why haven't you told anyone?"

Reggy shrugged, "No one asked."

I could have smacked myself in the forehead, "Well, can you take us there?"

Reggy was already grinning like a creepypasta monster, but I saw a glimmer pass over his eye, and I should have known to take it back. He wanted to show us, he wanted us to come with him, and I suddenly didn't want to go. But, it didn't really matter if I did or not. If there was a chance I could help my Dad and find those kids, I wanted to. Dad was worried about losing his job too if they didn't find someone, and I didn't want that to happen.

"Yeah, I'll show you right now. Come on."

Reggy looked over at Mrs. Simmon and Ms. Gaie to make sure they weren't paying attention and the four of us headed towards the school. Reggy led us into a side door, through the third-grade hallway, and to the middle of the school to an area called The Square. The Square has been a part of PS 24 since it was built back in the seventies. It's an area of grass with a couple of small trees growing there. How the roots don't mess up the school, I don't know, but it's a place that lots of kids usually go to between classes. There's a utility building in the middle of it and that was where Reggy took us. He pulled a long key out of his shorts pocket and unlocked the door, ushering us into the little building before closing us into total darkness.

Then he pulled the chain on a light hanging from the ceiling and we were left looking around a small square room of tools and other implements.

"There's no one in here," Becky said, looking around before looking back at Reggy with a scared look.

"Well ya," Reggy said, grabbing an edge of what turned out to be a carpet, ""Otherwise they would have found them by now."He pulled the carpet back and revealed a hatch in the floor. It was flush against the ground, with no wheel or handle to poke out, and if you didn't know it was there you would never see it under the rug. Reggy squeezed a pair of handles and pulled the hatch up to reveal a ladder that led down into the earth. Reggy started climbing down like he'd done it a thousand times before, and when he saw we weren't following him, he asked if we were coming.

"They're down here. If you want to see them, then you'll have to come down," he said, making his way down again as if the matter was settled.

I looked at Randal, but he just shook his head and went for the door, "No way, man. This is way too weird for me."

He put a hand on the knob, but when he turned it, the door was locked. I went to look for the flip lock that would let us out, but both sides of the knob had a keyhole. I had never seen anything like this, and I realized that Reggy had the only key to the door. We were locked in here with him, for better or worse, and we would need him to let us out too.

I looked at the hole and figured it beat being stuck in here.

At least we might find another way out if we went down.

We descended the ladder slowly, the darkness thick around us. I tried turning the light on my watch on to see a little, but it didn't provide much light. We spread out, trying to find a switch, and when the lights suddenly came on I jumped. We were in a big room, like a storage unit, and it stretched the length of the grass area above us. The ceiling was metal, the walls were metal, the floor was concrete, and the place was full of boxes. They were stacked up to the ceiling in some places, and I wondered what this place had been before it was just used to store things.

We grouped up, moving around as we checked the room, and I saw something speckled on the floor. It looked like someone had spilled juice or maybe paint, and as we came around a big stack of boxes, I saw another door. This one wasn't locked and as it came open we saw that it led down a long hallway that went further underground.

"What is this place, anyway?" Becky asked, sounding a little scared as we followed the tunnel.

"I'm not sure," Randal said, "But my mom told me that when she used to go here, back in the early eighties, people used to talk about there being bomb shelters or something under the school. She never saw them, but she said that was something the kids told scary stories about."

"You think that what these are?" I asked, seeing a door coming up on our left.

Randal shrugged, "Maybe. I guess it would make sense for it to be in the very middle of the school."

We tried the door, but it was locked tight. The next three were also locked, but the fifth door opened pretty easily and held what we were looking for. Well, not exactly what we were looking for, but we found the missing kids.

The room had been some kind of work room that had been turned into just another storage room. The boxes the kids were lying on were drenched in blood. They were dead, thankfully. If they hadn't been, they would have been screaming. They were naked, their clothes lying in rags, and someone had been very busy. Their arms and legs had been removed, the bones broken cruelly. Their stomachs had been opened, their entrails hanging around them like snakes, and a few of them were missing eyes. The little girl, Mary, I thought, had her jaw pulled off and her tongue was missing. Becky started throwing up, Randal sounded like he wanted to scream, and when someone started laughing I knew we'd stumbled into a trap.

It was Reggy, his bulk blocking the door. He had a knife, the long kind you’d find in a kitchen, and he was grinning like a creep again. He was just standing there, not trying to come after us, and it was clear that he realized, like we did, that we weren't going anywhere.

"Looks like you found the lost kids. Guess it's time to add three more to my little collection."

"Come on, Reggy," I said, trying to talk our way around him, "This isn't funny. You got us pretty good with these Halloween decorations, but enough is enough. You win, just let us out so we can,"

When he slashed me across the chest, slicing a long red line that split my t-shirt and the skin beneath, I hissed in pain and stumbled back.

"There's no getting out now. You're staying here forever. I meant to get you all before school ended, but there was just never a good opportunity. Now, we can be friends forever; all eight of us."

I was scared, but Randal had clearly gone well past scared. He screamed like a cat that's been stepped on and ran at Reggy, shoving him as the bigger boy stabbed him in the shoulder. Even though he'd got him, Reggy was still put off balance. He fell into some boxes and we scattered. Randal had gone back the way he came, Becky running behind him, but I knew there was no way out that way. I went left, running into the unknown, and when someone roared like a wounded beast behind me, I charged heedlessly.

I don't know how long I ran, I don't know how far I ran, but when I slammed into a ladder hard enough to make my eyes blur, I shook myself as I tried to climb it. I couldn't let him catch me. If he caught me, I'd be dead. I climbed and climbed and climbed and when I got to the top I pushed at the hatch and almost screamed when it wouldn't move.

I pushed and pushed, getting a little bit of give but it always came back down again. I couldn't make it budge, not even a little bit, and as I shoved at it, I started hearing something down the tunnel behind me. It wasn't loud, not like someone running, but it was feet coming up the concrete.

I screamed and shoved at the hatch, feeling it give but not open. I squinted as something fell onto my face, dirt or something, and I had to brace my back against the wall so I could use both hands. I got brief flashes of light as I shoved, just the slight glimmer from the edges, and when I heard the laughter from the bottom of the ladder, I kept shoving, praying to God to help me.

"Found you!" Reggy sing-songed putting his foot on the bottom rung of the ladder, "You might as well just come down. That hatch doesn't open. I don't know where it comes out at, but it's not going to help you."  

He started climbing and I felt like crying as I shoved at the hatch. My arms were hurting almost as badly as my chest, and I was afraid that he would get me before I got the hatch open. He would cut my legs and I would fall down the ladder. Then he could do whatever he wanted, probably drag me back to his little room and finish me off. I shoved and shoved, yelling for help as he got closer and closer. He was climbing slow on purpose, really stretching it out, and his words were muffled by the knife he had clamped in his teeth.

"Shcream all you loik. No one ish coming to help," but we both squinted when the hatch came slowly open and I saw the faces of about seven or eight kids I recognized from the program. They helped me out, yelling for a teacher as Reggy retreated down the ladder. They had seen him, though. They knew he was down there, and as the teachers came running, I was lying on the grass and breathing heavily.

I was in a corner of the field, the back corner by the utility shed, and the kids had been playing kickball when they heard a loud shrieking sound from that direction. It was the hinges on the door, long ago grown over with grass and covered with dirt. They came over and saw it opening and closing, and when they heard me yelling they came to help pull it open. The group of them had managed to fling it open, and as Mrs. Simmon came running to see what they were talking about, I breathed a sigh of relief.

I told them what had happened, told them how Becky and Randal were still down there, and Mrs. Simmon sent someone to call the police, but wouldn't go down there herself.

"If what you're saying is true then it would be dangerous for us to go down there until the police get here."

They came pretty quick, my Dad with them, and I told them the story again and begged them to save my friends before he hurt them. They went down the ladder, guns drawn and flashlights out, and my Dad and another officer told me to take them to the shed we'd gone in through. I took him there, but the door was standing open and I knew Reggy had fled. Dad went down the ladder and, to my relief, came up with Becky and Randal. They were scared but unharmed. They told us how Reggy had come running for the front door and climbed up while they hid behind some boxes. They said he hadn't even noticed them as he ran, and he seemed pretty scared.

The police took the bodies out in bags, and the whole place was covered in tape. They got Reggy's Dad too, and he told them how he had known there was something off about his son, but hadn't known he was that off. "Sometimes I was afraid to sleep with him in the same house," he told them, "I know it's not right to be afraid of your kid, but I was really afraid that he would kill me one night." The police decided he hadn't had anything to do with it, though I hear the school fired him for knowingly letting Reggy take his keys to get into restricted areas.

As for Reggy, no one knows what happened to him.

Wherever he ran to, he was never seen again.

Now the ghost stories around school are all about Reggy and how he's just waiting for his next chance to kill more kids.

If they'd been down in those tunnels that day, if they had stood face to face with the psycho while he contemplated killing us, they might not be so quick to tell stories about him.
