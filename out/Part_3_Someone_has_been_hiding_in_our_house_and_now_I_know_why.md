“You need a doctor.”

Jacob’s voice was firm, he was talking to me from the fridge, his head looking for something inside it. My head was still spinning while I sipped the coffee he had made for me. After seeing the horrifying creature crawling on the ceiling the night before, Jacob told me, I just collapsed on the floor. I only remembered waking up in his arms, a position I immediately escaped from, seeking a distance between each other I still hadn’t reduced that morning. And I had no intention to. I’d called in sick at work and all I wanted now was for him to leave the house, so I could clear my head.

I didn’t answer, didn’t look at him. After half an hour, he left the house. I strategically closed myself in the toilet when I knew he was about to, so I could avoid rejecting his good-bye kiss and having to give any sort of explanation.

Why didn’t I want to touch him or be touched by him? Was I… scared? Was it just because of the dream, or because of that finger pointing at him in the dark? No. It wasn’t just that. It was his behavior, his constant manipulation trying to get me into believing his words instead of myself. Instead of what I was seeing. It was the fact I now knew for certain he was seeing what I was seeing. I knew he was hiding something.

A thought finally made it into my mind, a thought I felt was always hiding, covered under sheets of artificial happiness in my mind: how well did I really know Jacob? Sure, we’d spent the last 4 years together. But I’d never really heard many stories around his past. He knew all about me, about my mother’s struggles with addiction, about my dad’s early departure, about all my fears.

I didn’t know anything about him. I’d never met his parents, he said they didn’t have a good relationship. In all fairness, I never saw him attempting any kind of communication with them.

I knew he’d been married, he’d been transparent about that. But that was it. He didn’t tell me why it ended, other than mentioning she was abusive. He didn’t tell me where she was now. Had I spent 4 years of my life with someone I didn’t know? With someone that seemed so strange and yet so comfortable in the role he’d played in my horrible and yet so real nightmare?

I thought of our uninvited guest, the creature hiding in the dark corners of our house. Of the hate it had shown toward my husband on two different occasions. I thought of Jacob’s eyes looking at something behind me in the living room.

Then I heard a sound from the living room. It sounded like ticking on glass, but it was low and irregular. I froze and tended my ears, the sound stopped. I took a deep breath and started walking to the living room. It was in the middle of the day, but it was a cloudy day and all the lights in the house were switched off.

Our living room is surrounded by big windows, a few of them leading up to our small yard and the street that passes through the neighborhood. One of these windows was where I’d seen the yellow eyes when all of this started.

And it was through that same window that I saw a dark figure. Someone was standing outside, in my yard. A tall figure, covered in a long jacket. The hood was casting a shadow over its face so I couldn’t see much, but I knew for sure the stranger was staring at me through the window. I held my breath for a moment, then found the courage to move on. Keeping my eyes on the window and the figure beyond it, I started walking to the door, determined to confront the stranger.

Then my eyes caught a glimpse of something on my left. Another window. I turned my head and to my horror saw that something had been written on it, from outside. It was written in reverse, so that I could read it from inside. Someone had left a message for me in red chalk. I would have been more scared in that moment, thinking that someone had been standing right outside my window writing with chalk, if I hadn’t been so concentrated in reading what the message was saying. And that was what got all my attention.

*He’s been hiding.*

I knew I had to do two things. Erase the message before Jacob would come home, and confront my husband.

*He’s been hiding.*

I couldn’t stop thinking of the message written in chalk. Was someone trying to warn me about him? What’s he hiding? I thought of the letters, of the red chalk. Then I remembered the nightmare, and those words, written in what looked like the same material. I had to know more about Jacob. I had to dig into my husband’s skeletons.

And I had only one piece of information about his past. He’d had an abusive relationship and he was divorced. His ex-wife was Amalia, an archeologist.

I finished cleaning the chalk and rushed to my desk. I googled “Amalia archeologist” and an article of a few years back popped up on top of the search results. The article was from a local Italian newspaper, but google translate provided for a good enough translation.

**ANCIENT DEFIXIONES FINALLY FOUND IN ESCAVATION**

*Amalia \[Redacted\], director of the archeology department at the University of \[Redacted\] marked the culmination of a 15-year long research yesterday, in \[Redacted\].*

*Amalia and her team have dedicated 15 years to the study of Ancient Rome’s religious practices, and have been searching for years for what they believe they might have finally found: the defixiones.*

*Also called “curse tablets”, these tablets are believed to be an ancient form of ritual practices of black magic in Ancient Rome. Romans believed that writing in these tablets would put them in contact with the gods and the dead, which they could then use to take down their enemies. The escavation near started after a long back and forth with the Italian government, has rewarded Amalia’s long devotion to research.*

I scrolled down to the bottom of the article. There was a picture: a blond woman was holding a tablet that looked made of lead. I zoomed in. Right on the tablet I saw the same kind of strange words I’d seen on the walls and floor in my dream.

Next, I searched “defixiones”. Oddly, the first article that showed on top was of just a few weeks ago. Same local newspaper. I winked in distress, then read the approximate translation.

**DEFIXIONES DISAPPEAR FROM \[REDACTED\] MUSEUM**

*The so-called “curse tablets”, finally placed in the \[redacted\] Museum after a 5-year battle between the Municipality, the owner of the land where the piece has been found and Amalia’s team of archeologists, have been reported as missing last night.*

*Through the official twitter account of her department, Amalia, the lead archeologist who 5 years ago brought the defixiones to light, has declared her deep sorrow.*

*The artifacts were held in the small local museum and it’s not clear how much value these tablets could be sold for in the black artifacts market.*

That didn’t help much. I now knew what Amalia had dedicated her life to. I knew some ancient piece of history had probably been sold for some thousands bucks in the black market. I knew those words were written in Latin.

*He’s been hiding.*

I had enough to face my husband.
