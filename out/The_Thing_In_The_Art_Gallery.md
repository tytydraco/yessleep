January 5th 1993,
I came across a beautiful painting the other day at the art show. It didn’t have a label, but after some snooping, I met the artist. She was a lovely lady and clearly talented, but she also seemed distressed and distracted about something.

January 6th 1993,
I saw the same painting from the gallery at the art auction today. I don’t know why, but I think I might buy it. I’ve expressed my interest to the artist but she seems reluctant to part with it despite putting it up for auction. She removed it from the bidding halfway through the auction.

I’ve been in contact with the artist for a month now, and we’ve become good friends over this time. And over this time, I’ve seen her disdain for that portrait, but anytime I suggest selling it or simply throwing it away, she insists she cannot.

February 11th 1993,
The artist sent me a surprising message: she's selling (or rather giving) me the painting. I asked her why she had a sudden change of heart, but she wouldn’t say why specifically. She says she just wants to be rid of it. I suppose I can’t complain, I’ve wanted it in my gallery since I first saw it.

February 12th 1993,
The painting is finally in my gallery. I feel amazing, like a kid on Christmas! But I can’t help but notice that the painting looks a little bit different than I remember… something about it doesn’t look the same. Something about its face or the way it stares at me doesn’t sit right with me. I keep trying to contact the artist, but she isn’t responding to my messages. The delivery people even say the painting was left on the curb. 

February 13th 1993,
I misplaced my coffee mug somewhere in the gallery, I went to look for it and found it under that painting. My cleaning lady, Mrs Finch, refuses to enter the gallery now and says if she is required to clean that room, she’ll quit. I decided I liked a partly clean house more than I liked firing someone I know will have difficulty getting work elsewhere due to her age. Besides, she's been a loyal employee since my father was alive, so perhaps I owe her a great measure of loyalty in return. I’ll just clean the gallery myself. 

February 14th 1993,
I need to stop drinking coffee, I was cleaning the gallery the other night when I could’ve sworn I saw that portrait glaring at me. It must’ve been some trick of the mind or an optical illusion of sorts. I’m drinking decaf from now on.

February 15th 1993,
The painting. Last night I awoke under it. I must’ve sleepwalked to it. Stupid decaf just didn’t sit right in my stomach, I suppose. I had a strange dream that I had been staring into the painting and the lady in the portrait winked at me and reached her hand out to me. I became afraid and screamed as her offering hand turned sinister as she lunged for me. When I awoke, the painting looked a little bit different.

Mrs Finch, if you ever read this, burn the gallery.

 I have locked the door to ensure the painting cannot harm anyone, but I fear for my safety. 

Last night I was cleaning the gallery and thought I caught someone who’d broken inside, when I tried to catch them, they ran towards the painting, rounded the corner towards it, and vanished. 

I looked at the painting, and for a brief moment, the painting smiled and winked at me. 

I screamed and ran into my study and locked the doors to the gallery. 

I have been in this room since. 

I write this in fragments because I must get up from my chair to check on the painting through the windows on the gallery doors.

It is now evening, and I went to check on the painting. 

The lady inside it is gone. As I write this, I can see her in the corner of my eye. Smiling at me. God save me. Please.
