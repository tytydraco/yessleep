**I was 16 years old when they found the tumor in my brain; it was the luckiest thing that had ever happened to me. Up until that point in my life, I was always surrounded by the luckiest people on the face of the earth. I didn’t grow up needing or wanting anything. My brother and I were kids who had to pretend like local shops and schools weren’t named after some great-grandfather or other. We were cursed to reap the benefits and sulk in the shadows of some old guys we had no real connection to other than a fortune that we didn’t question. But one thing was for sure: whenever bad things happened to me, the opposite was true for my family.**

**Let me give you an example. It was during Christmas—I remember that because of all the tinsel and string lights wrapping the already gaudy Victorian-era house we grew up in. My dad was in a surprisingly happy mood for once and was keen on hosting our entire family at our house for the holidays. He put my older brother Nick in charge of "handling the kids," as he called it. My brother was never bright, but boy, was he prideful. He took to the orders like a warden, and we were his 6- to 12-year-old prisoners. Growing up, Nick always loved to make up games for us to play, but the games he made up always got too rough or turned into some way for Nick to lord over us younger McAllen offspring.**

**This time Nick’s game was hide-and-seek with the lights off—a revolutionary idea to our small brains. My brother had us go about the second floor of the house, turning off all of the lights. With each satisfying click, more and more of the familiar upstairs hallways became a dark labyrinth, holding fears that manifested as quickly as my mind could conjure them. Before long, the game was on, me and my cousins scrambling in the dark to find a laundry basket or bed to hide under. My brother’s always been good at hide-and-seek; he had an uncanny skill for finding people, even this early in life. Me, on the other hand? Not so much. But I was quick—quicker than anyone in my family—which was usually my fallback strategy in games like this.**

**My cousin Macy and I found ourselves hiding behind a guest room bed when Nick passed the doorframe and halted in his tracks. He turned on his heel like a changing train car before bolting into the room towards us. If there is anything you need to know about McAllens, we like to win. I’m no different. I took off at full pace over the top of the bed, leaving Macy to be the cornered loser as I barreled out of the room. I heard her screaming laughter followed by the footsteps of what I can only assume was Nick chasing behind me. I don’t remember much after this—just a light push, then the sinking in my stomach as the carpet at the top of the stairs slipped out and gave me a more parallel look at the ceiling than I’d ever asked for. By the time Newton’s laws were done with me, I found myself in a screaming heap at the bottom of the stairs. Nick came flying down the stairs behind me, apologizing profusely, my uncle right behind him with a stunned look as if he’d never seen someone’s arm backward before. One ER visit and a lot of questioning later, and Nick was still the only one who believed me when I said I was pushed. But that investigation fell to the wayside when my cousin got a Division 1 football scholarship that same weekend. Go Bulldogs.**

**Sure, that sounds like a coincidence by itself, but that wasn’t the first time. I think that’s why, when the wiry doctor’s news hit that sterile office, I felt like an anchor in a storm—unmoved, unlike my mom. I do remember how little my dad reacted, like it was par for the course. I couldn’t blame him; I felt the same way. After that, it was a bit of a blur. My mom talked to the doctor about treatments, and we left in a hurry, a bouquet of pharmaceutical pamphlets under her arm. The next two years would leave me with a lot of time on my hands. Not long after my diagnosis was when we found out Nick’s now-wife was pregnant. Naturally, that took a lot of my mom’s attention, leaving me to get used to the routine on my own quickly. So I started cataloging. Between IV drips and weekly medical visits, my time was passed trying to recall all of these strange coincidences of misfortune. Once I did that, the pattern that began to present itself unnerved me—kind of like that feeling you get when you leave an old basement after you turn the lights off. Logically, you know nothing is creeping in the dark, but that doesn’t make the pit in your stomach feel any less wrong.**
