Right now I’m sitting in a police station. The sun’s about an hour away from rising. A lot has happened.

These have been the most stressful hours of my life.

The cops spent nearly an hour in my apartment before coming back out. When they did, their skin was pale and their expressions were blank, detached. As if they were having trouble coming to terms with whatever it was they’d just seen.

They told me that there was somebody in my room. A woman. She was standing by the door in a way that I wouldn’t have noticed upon first entering. Wouldn’t have noticed at all until I actually turned around to get into bed.

So I asked them where the woman was now. They told me she was still there. Still in my room. I had to process that for a moment. Then I asked them why the hell they hadn’t dragged her out.

They briefly glanced at each other, both looking really uncomfortable before telling me they weren’t able to. As in they actually physically couldn’t do it.

I shook my head and told them I wasn’t following. Viana wasn’t the biggest person, but the other officer who’d arrived looked like he could pick me up with one arm and chuck me across a field.

Again, they just told me that she couldn’t be moved. They’d even tried using tasers. Nothing. She didn’t react. As if she were a statue fixed in place. But they were absolutely positive that she wasn’t a statue.

I asked them what she looked like. They asked me if I was sure I wanted to know. That they could show me but her appearance may cause further psychological distress.

I asked them to show me anyway.

It was a strange thing. In the back of my mind, I had already been anticipating it. But even with the evidence presented so clearly and irrefutably before me, there was still a part of me that refused to believe it.

It was the same woman from the picture.  

It couldn’t be avoided anymore. I showed them the email and then I explained everything.

They asked a lot of questions. I answered with the information that I had. They didn’t seem to want to believe it either. It was like we’d all entered the twilight zone.

They confirmed a few other details as well. Like how a strong odor of sewage had been emanating from the woman. That it looked like she had been severely injured, one of her arms horrifically bent and twisted, scrapes and cuts all over her body. They had only shown me her picture from the shoulders up, but she’d actually been completely naked.

They had already called for additional backup. Once they arrived, Viana drove me down to the police station. For my own safety, she’d claimed.

In the car, I asked her how they planned on dealing with this, what exactly they were going to do. She said that she wasn’t sure. That there really wasn’t a precedent for something like this. She was pretty obviously disturbed by it all but doing her best not to show it.

She then asked me who Jackson Smith was. I told her he was a friend that I’d known since middle school. Then I asked what the hell he had to do with this.

She said that he had been the one that sent me the email. That I probably hadn’t noticed because he’d first forwarded it to a dummy account which had then forwarded it to me.

She asked me when it was the last time I saw him. I told her it was a couple of weeks ago. We’d gone out drinking. He’d picked me up and parked on a residential street a few blocks away from downtown and told me he’d leave it there overnight.

The night had been a disaster. I’d fallen into old habits and blacked out. At least I assumed that I had. There was a lapse in my memories. One second we were taking tequila shots and the next thing I knew, I was in the passenger’s seat of his car.

I didn’t know how late it was. Could’ve been three or four in the morning. All I had was a vague recollection of being in the car and then getting dropped off. I didn’t remember anything he’d said to me or anything I’d seen. I was even too out of it to question why he was driving at all.

That’s basically what I told her. She just nodded.

I tried giving Jackson a call but he wasn’t picking up. I then asked some mutual friends if anybody had seen him lately. Nobody replied until we had reached the station. Craig said that he’d seen Jackson at a gas station around noon. That the guy hadn’t said much and seemed pretty eager to get back on the road.

Inside the police station, I asked them if there had been any reports of a body going missing from a morgue. They said that’s what they were currently trying to figure out.

I was then led into an interrogation room.

The first detective asked me a myriad of things. To give an account of my entire day from morning to night, whether I’d ever seen the woman before, if I’d ever heard anybody breaking in. He asked me if this entire thing was a prank that I may or may not have been in on. If I actually believed that the email itself caused the woman to suddenly appear in my room.

Soon it became obvious that he was trying to bait me into confirming one of two outcomes. That I was either clinically insane or that I’d actually kidnapped the woman.

But I could tell that I wasn’t giving him the answers he wanted. That he was becoming aggravated. That he really didn’t even believe any of this. But I just told him what I knew. What had really happened.

After about an hour, he was replaced by somebody else. This guy actually shook my hand and told me his name. Detective Brito. The first thing he told me after sitting down was that he believed everything that I’d said. That I must’ve been terrified and confused and that I had his deepest sympathies.

It was a refreshing thing to hear, but I could not believe they were pulling the good cop, bad cop shit. I mean, what the hell did they think I had done? Even if I had done something, why would I turn myself in?

I asked Brito why he was so sure that I was telling the truth. Just to see what he’d say. Normally I wouldn’t have been so bold with a cop, but I was starting to lose my shit.

He just smiled, told me that earlier in his life, he wouldn’t have believed it either. But a few years ago, he’d gone through something that had forced him to question his understanding of things. That now he was a lot more open minded.

I asked him what exactly he’d experienced. He said that he’d tell me later. That we should deal with this first.

He proceeded to give me an update on the woman.

The entire building has now been evacuated and the SWAT have been called. They still haven’t been able to move her. She still hasn’t said a word. Every now and then she’ll turn her head or body, but she always remains standing in the same exact spot beside my door. Sometimes she’ll be facing ahead and other times she’ll be staring into a corner. He said that the FBI have started tracking the situation.

I asked him to clarify what he meant when he said they still haven’t been able to move her.

He said that this is the part that nobody’s been able to make heads or tails of. Given the evidence, they have to conclude that she’s completely resistant against physical force, electricity, chemicals, sedatives, pretty much anything that they’re legally cleared to try. She still hasn’t displayed any aggression so they’re not sure what a bullet to the head would do.

He said that one option that was still on the table was cutting the floor out from beneath her and then loading her into a truck. But that would probably end up being extremely annoying for me.

I asked him about Jackson. He told me that they were looking for him. That his vehicle’s been spotted several states over but they haven’t been able to catch him.

At that point, I really wasn’t sure what to say anymore. I think I buried my face in my hands, screamed expletives into my palm. Which Brito didn’t react to.

I told him that I really needed to get some sleep if he wanted to get any useful information out of me. Then I suddenly thought about Elisa, remembering that I’d forwarded the email to her. I could feel a wave of guilt wash over me.

I brought it up to Brito, told him that they should find out where she lives and send somebody over to check on her. Just in case. He said that might be a good idea. That he’d call it in. But in the meantime, I was free to leave and I should go get some rest. That we’d talk again in the morning.

I left the station and picked up a six pack then headed for a motel where I booked a room for the night. I’m exhausted on all fronts. I haven’t changed clothes in nearly twenty-four hours and I can feel my skin sticking to my shirt.

I don’t know what to think. Quite frankly, I don’t want to think about anything at all. Which is where the alcohol comes in. I’m four deep now and it’s all starting to feel a bit less real. I know I shouldn’t be using it as a crutch. But I just don’t want to fucking deal with this.

Before trying to get some sleep, I sent my boss a text, telling him I wouldn’t be in tomorrow.

And then I checked my email.

Jackson had forwarded me another. This time, there was no subject.

All it contained was this message:

*YOU THINK YOU’RE DONE WITH THIS BUT YOU AREN’T.*

*YOU THINK YOU’VE ESCAPED HER BUT YOU HAVEN’T.*

*YOU MUST PAY.*

*YOU MUST PAY.*

*IF YOU DO NOT FORWARD THIS TO FIVE MORE PEOPLE, THE NEXT TIME YOU TAKE A SHOWER, SHE WILL BE IN THERE WITH YOU.*

*SHE WILL DRAG YOU DOWN INTO SOMETHING WORSE THAN HELL. SOMETHING WORSE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.*

*YOU WILL PAY.*
