I stood frozen in front of the bathroom mirror, unable to tear my gaze away from the figure staring back at me.  My reflection moved on its own, its lips curving up into a sinister grin.  My heart raced as its hand reached out towards me, its fingers curling into a claw.  I tried to step back, but my feet felt rooted to the ground.  The fingers were so close now, I could almost feel the icy touch against my skin.

I shut my eyes tight, praying that when I opened them, everything would be back to normal.  But when I did, my reflection was still there, its head now almost out of the mirror.  I could see its fangs glistening in the dim light of the bathroom.  It snarled at me, making obscene gestures and mocking my fear.

I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything to escape the horror before me.  But I knew I had to stay, had to face this thing that was haunting me.  I confided in my best friend Jane, but even she seemed hesitant to believe me.  She tried to reassure me that it was all in my head, but the fear in her eyes betrayed her doubts.  Everyone thought I was losing my mind, but I knew something was going on and I was on my own.

The incidents kept increasing in intensity, and I found myself spending hours in front of the mirror, hoping to catch a glimpse of the truth.  But every time, my reflection seemed to grow stronger, its hold on me more powerful.  I felt like I was slowly losing my grip on reality, fading away into the darkness that lurked behind the glass.

My friend Tom told me my reflection was a manifestation of my unresolved trauma, and that I needed to confront my fears in order to move forward with my life.

But how could I do that when the reflection was still there, still taunting me with its twisted grin and sharp claws? And how could he be so sure it's nothing sinister?  Every time I looked in the mirror, I felt like I was staring into the eyes of a demon.  Fear flooded through me every time I stared at my reflection.

And then, this morning, something changed.  As I stood there in front of the mirror, I noticed that my reflection had completely poked its head out from the glass, something that had never happened before.  It seemed to be trying to reach me, to get closer to me.  And then I saw its eyes.  They were no longer mocking or cruel.  They were pleading, begging for help, trying to tell me something.

I didn't know what to do.  Was this a trick of my mind, or was there something more sinister at work? I felt like I was caught in a nightmare, with no escape in sight.  And then I felt a cold breeze brush against the back of my neck.
