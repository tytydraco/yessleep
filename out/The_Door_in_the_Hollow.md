My name is Elijah. Never liked that name. I prefer Eli - shorter, less biblical, less... heavy. 

My mother gave it to me. She was the kind of woman who left crosses above every doorframe and whispered prayers like they were passwords to another world. "Elijah," she used to say, "was a man of fire. A prophet. A messenger of God." 

She said it like it meant something. Like I was supposed to live up to it. But to me, it always sounded like a curse. Too big for me. Too loud. Too certain. A name that came with expectations I never agreed to. Like being handed a coat you never asked to wear, stitched from someone else's beliefs. 

I'm not a religious man. At least, I wasn't.

But that changed. or started to change. Because of what happened a few years ago. And because it happened again - last night. 

I love to camp. I like the quiet, the solitude. The way the trees lean in, like they're listening. The way firelight makes everything dance. And of course the stories. Yeah, I know a story or two. Isn't that what campers are? Storytellers?

That's what I thought. Until I realized not all stories want to be told. Some wait in the silence. Some breathe in the dark. And some - some are listening back. 

Her name was Mara. We were supposed to go camping together- Black Hollow. She picked the spot, circled it on the map with a red pen. "It's got a view of the whole valley," she said "Feels like you're standing on the edge of the world." 

We never made it.

She died two weeks before the trip. A Car accident. Wrong place, wrong time. That's what they told me, like it made any difference. I didn't camp for a long time after that. Couldn't.

The thought of it made my chest feel tight - like my lungs were wrapped in barbed wire. But time moves in strange ways. It dulls some things. Honestly, I just felt numb. I know it sharpens others. You start telling yourself you're okay, even if you're not. You start believing it, too. 

Three years later, I packed my gear. Same backpack, same boots, same sleeping bag we were supposed to share. I told myself it was part of the healing process. One final step.

I was going to camp at Black Hollow. For her. For us.

The trail was over grown, almost like it hadn't been walked since. The map she circled was still folded in my glove box - her handwriting fading, but still there. I followed it.

When I reached the clearing, It didn't feel like I remembered. It was quiet, yes. But not the kind of quiet that soothes you. the kind that waits. 

I set up camp. Made a fire. Watched the stars come out, one by one, like old friends trying to remember my name. 

And then I saw it. 

A door. Standing in the middle of the trees. no walls. No frame. Just a door - old, wooden, half-rotted, leaning slightly to one side. Like it had been waiting there for years. 

At first, I thought it was some kind of memorial. Maybe someone else had lost someone here and left it behind, like a marker. I dont know. 

But it didn't feel like a tribute. It felt... wrong.

Like something forgotten by the world but not by the woods. I didn't touch it not that night.

I didn't sleep, either.

The fire was dying and I watched it go without trying to stop it. Coals like little red eyes blinking shut one by one. The cold crept in slow. I sat with my arms tucked in and my grief curled beside me like it always does. It doesn't say much, just stays close. I heard the trees breathing. The low creak of the earth turning. A bird crying somewhere in the dark like it knew something I didn't. And then I heard her voice.

Mara. Not the way you hear someone in a dream. This was different Clear. Close. "*Eli"*, she said. Soft as anything. Like she was standing right behind me. Like she'd never died at all. 

I stood. I don't remember doing it, just that I was on my feet and moving through the trees toward that crooked old door. It hadn't changed. Still leaning. still there like it'd always been there, like the woods had grown up around it.

I should've run. I should've prayed. But I didn't. Her voice came again. *"Please".* 

Just that. A single word and I swear it held every bit of her. The doorknob turned. Slow. Just a twitch. Enough to see the black line split down the center like a crack in the world. Not night. Not shadow. Something deeper. Older. Something without name. And I stood there, watching it open.
