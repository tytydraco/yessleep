I only made it out of the coffee shop I was in for my last post by the skin of my teeth, but I'm back again to tell a bit more of the story. I made it to a hotel in a place I won't mention, so I'm hopeful I can get through a bit more in this update, but, we'll see.

After my dad got lost at the airport, at first I didn't want to believe that anything had happened to him. Other than the menacing glare, he seemed normal. The drive home with my dad was mostly uneventful, he didn't say anything unusual, and everything seemed altogether normal. I started to doubt if he had even given me a menacing look, he is not as young as he used to be, maybe he just suddenly had an ache in his back with all the hugs? Anyways, everything seemed normal, and even happy. 

Something about him almost going missing scared my sister so much that she decided to extend her vacation a bit, and suggested we all head up into the mountains together for some hiking. As children our parents used to take us on hiking outings pretty regularly, but we hadn't been as a family in years. We picked some good hikes, made some reservations at a hotel adjacent to a hot springs we had enjoyed years ago, and I requested time off from work which was surprisingly granted. Everything seemed to be going up and up.

Until the second night in our hotel.

We had just done the first big hike of the trip, a segment of the continental divide trail, and had a hearty dinner in town before turning in for the night. My parents shared a large room, and my sister and I each had our own smaller single rooms. It was motel style, but it didn't feel rundown at all. I had been in bed for almost an hour already, but was only just at the edge of sleep having horrible chronic insomnia. I was just finally starting to feel myself drift off when I heard a rustling at my door. I froze, unsure what I should do.

I was just considering getting up when the rustling stopped, only to be replaced by the slow creaking of the door as it was opened very slowly. I should have leapt up, but it felt like there was an elephant on my chest, and something in my mind screamed at me to stay still, so I didn't move and kept my eyes clamped shut. I heard someone walk quietly over the carpet towards my bed.

There was the sound of heavy breathing above me, and I could feel the wet stickiness of the person's breath hit my face. I tried to breath naturally, but had to choke down a cough from the odd smell coming from them. I don't know how long I laid there tensely trying to keep up the charade.

Finally, the person spoke with my father's voice. "I know you know. I don't care. There's nothing you can do, your father's gone. It's only me now. If you are good, maybe I'll save you for last, maybe I'll get your sister first."

His breath as he spoke smelled even more strongly of the strange scent that I suddenly recognized as the smell of rot. I remained frozen, fighting my urge to retch or grab him and demand he leave my sister alone.

After what felt like an eternity, I heard his footsteps moving back towards the door. "Yeah. I think I'll start with her. Sweet dreams."

I heard the door close. I waited a few minutes, desperately willing my body to respond. Finally I was able to muster the courage to sit up, though it felt like my muscles were still fighting against me. For a few minutes I just rocked in place, unsure what I should do. Should I try to tell my sister and mother? Should I just not let my sister be alone with him? I couldn't do that forever, what about when she finally went back to work in San Francisco? Could this thing masquerading as my father get her there?

The next day we started with another hike, this time to a nearby peak. It was a hard push, with a little scrambling and a great deal of wind at the peak, but we made it. Throughout the hike I tried to make sure I was never out of sight of my sister, and as much as possible I stayed right next to her. I watched the thing that had replaced my dad, but throughout the whole hike he didn't behave suspiciously other than looking confused at me when I'd refuse to leave my sister even to take pictures at the high point. I had to give it to him, he was playing the role perfectly.

After the hike, we all opted to hit the hot springs adjacent to our hotel. My mom and sister decided to head to the thermal caves, leaving the thing that replaced my dad and I stuck in the pool since the caves were gender segregated. While not happy to be stuck alone with the replacement, I was deeply relieved that my sister would be safe.

"Well son - where do you wanna go? Want to hit the thermal caves?"

I thought for a moment, thinking maybe that would be nice, even with this replacement, before realizing that would make it more likely we'd find ourselves in an isolated place, something I wanted to avoid at all costs.

"Nah dad, how about we go to the hot springs swimming pool? I'd like a little more room to play in the water, and it's a bit more comfortable."

He laughed, "Whatever you say son, I just want to get my muscles nice and soft after that hike."

Despite the company, the pool was nice. I got to soak and managed to mostly avoid talking to that thing while I let my muscles relax from the hike. After a while I got out of the pool and rested in one of the chairs to avoid overheating and to think. I wasn't sure what I'd do that night, because then my sister would finally be alone in her room and I wasn't sure that I could finnagle a way to be there with her the whole night.

My brainstorming was interrupted by a cry from the thing that had replaced my dad. He had moved into the deep end of the pool, and it seemed like his muscles had cramped badly, and he was struggling to swim. He was trying to scream for me to help him, but his face was so far under water that he couldn't manage. I ran to the side of the pool he was trying to get to, and readied myself to jump in.

Then it hit me. This was the solution to my problem. This thing had replaced and probably killed my dad - he had already said my dad was gone - and threatened my sister. If he died, all my worries would be over. I gulped hard, still not sure what to do, but I just sat, watching. I saw the thing wearing my dad's face look terrified, and a sense of shame washed over me. I wanted to help, so badly, my soul screamed for me to just jump in, but I knew the only chance my sister would have is if I didn't.

It took a few minutes, but, eventually I saw him stop moving beneath the water. I stared in shock, unable to think straight. Finally I realized I needed to call someone. I ran to the emergency phone at the pool entrance and called the lobby.

The rest of the day went by in a haze. There was an ambulance, a declaration that the thing that replaced my dad was not dead, but in a coma, lots of crying by all of us - them for the thing in a coma, me for my dad who I knew was already dead. After the hospital we decided to stay back at the hotels for now, to remain close to the hospital. The doctors said that they would decide what to do in the next few days - either he'd wake up, or they'd relocate him to Denver.

Falling asleep that night, I felt grief for my father, but relief that the thing stealing his body was in a coma and that my sister would be safe. I managed to fall asleep in only a half hour, the easiest sleep I'd had in years.

I woke up startled by the door opening again. I kept my eyes shut again, not sure what was happening, but knowing it would be safer if I just played asleep. I heard and felt someone breathing over me again. The smell was that same smell of rot that had come from the thing that replaced my father, but with a faint tinge of a sweet orange scent.

When they finally spoke, they uttered only a single phrase, a phrase that haunts me to this day.

"Too late," the thing that replaced my sister said.

Alright, I should probably leave things there for now. I promise I'll post again and finish catching you all up, but I need to spend some time today planning my next move. In the meantime, let me suggest that you don't leave your loved ones alone after traveling through the Denver airport - or you may wake up to them not being your loved ones any longer.
