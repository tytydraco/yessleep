I walked into my son's room to wake him up, it was supposed to be his first day of kindergarten.

The old door shrieked in pain as I opened it, "Junior, buddy, it's time to get ready for your first day of school." There was no recipient in the room, my voice bounced aimlessly against the wall and through the air. His blankets had been messily shuffled about on his race-car bed that he had begged me to buy.

His backpack was still resting against his desk, and the outfit he helped pick out, a Ninja Turtle T-shirt and a pair of blue jeans, sat neatly folded on the small desk beside his bed. A can of Lysol disinfectant spray that I had slapped a sticker on that said "Monster Repellent" stood proudly on the dresser. I felt my stomach drop, and I called out for him.

I heard a faint rustling sound, and I felt a smile grow on my face, "Bud we don't have time to play hide and seek, don't you want to meet your new friends?" I stepped beyond the threshold and into his room, and began my search of his room. My hope dwindled slowly as I didn't hear my son's signature hide and seek giggle, the kid just can't keep quiet when he hides, it's one of his several quirks that makes me love him even more than I already do. Any remaining hope that I had in that moment was ripped away from me once I heard the rustling sound again, now more discernible.

the blinds to his window shook gently as a breeze game through.

The window was open as wide as physically possible, and the screen had been removed where it lay in the grass of the backyard like a fallen soldier. The humid New England summer air violently invaded the room as the A/C made feeble attempts to combat it. My heart began to race, and I did the only thing my brain allowed me to do, I screamed my son's name out of the window. I screamed until my lungs gave out, took a deep breath, and repeated the process, countless times, only stopping once my voice shook with grief. Once I finally regained my wits, I called the police.

Within mere minutes there was a swarm of police officers outside my home, several of which came in and talked to me, and honestly it's all a fucking blur. I must have answered at least 3 or 4 dozen questions from one of the uniformed officer before the detective arrived.

Detective Callahan arrived somewhere around 20 minutes into the chaos, we exchanged pleasantries, but after that he was all business. "When was the last time you saw your boy?" His thick southern accent had been marred by countless cigarettes, his voice was gravel to my ears.

"It was his bedtime," I responded as he took a pack of Marlboro reds out from his inner jacket pocket. He gestured the pack toward me and I obliged, bringing the cigarette to my lips, lighting it with his lighter. "I checked his room for monsters and then I went into my room. When I woke up this morning he was just ... gone."

His graying eyebrows furrowed, "What do you mean when you say you 'checked his room for monsters?'"

"We do it every night. There's a can of Lysol in his room with a sticker that just says 'Monster Repellent', I walk around the room, I spray it in the closet, on the windowsills, just all over. It started a couple of years ago, he was watching the TV and the news came on, talking about that kidnapping spree. I told him it was a monster that was taking the kids, and so he asked that I check his room for monsters. He doesn't fall asleep until I check." I took a drag of the cigarette, a failed attempt to relieve my anxiety.

He nodded in understanding, "I remember that spree," smoke billowed out from his mouth as he spoke. "What was he wearing when you put him to bed."

"He had a Bluey T-shirt on, and spiderman PJ pants, the Bluey shirt has one character giving the other one a piggy back ride on it." my right leg began to bounce uncontrollably, and my hand had a slight tremor to it as I moved the cigarette down towards my body.

He wrote my response down in a notepad, "My granddaughter loves that show, always begs for my to put it on when she visits." His attempt to build a rapport didn't land, in all honesty it only served to frustrate and anger me. "Where is the boy's mother?"

"He has a fucking name, you know?!" I blurted out, my emotions getting the better of me in the moment.

He exhaled and bowed his head for a second, "I'm sorry," he paused briefly, "Where is Timmy's mother?"

I sighed, "I'm sorry, I'm just in a rough spot right now." he responded with a simple nod, "She passed away, just shy of a year ago, she got hit by a drunk driver on her way home from work one night. it's just been Junior and I ever since." The tremor in my hand worsened, cigarette ash began to fly freely from its burning end.

"I'm sorry for your loss." His comment was empty, something to say when you don't have anything else to say. A simple social nicety that he afforded me, as I was now truly alone. "Here's what I'll tell you, I can't promise you much, but I can promise that I will work night and day, until your boy - I mean, Timmy is found. Do you have a recent picture of him?"

"Yes," I grabbed his framed pre-k picture, "This is from a couple months ago, he's missing one of his front bottom front teeth right now, fell out the other night." I stammered and fumbled my way through the sentence, my anxiety continued to get the better of me, an endless pit formed in my stomach.

"Thank you, he's a cute kid. Do you have anything that might have his scent on it? we're going to get some dogs over here to aid in the search?"

I ran over to the shoe rack to grab his pair of light-up sketchers, he wore them so often that only 1/3 of the lights actually lit up. It's a hassle to get him to wear any other shoe. He quickly grabbed the shoe and inspected it, he made a face that said something along the lines of "This will do". As he inspected the shoe the sleeves on his jacket slid down his arm ever so slightly to reveal a tattoo, it looked like a name.

"Is that your grandchild's name?" I attempted to focus on anything else.

He looked at me with a puzzled expression plastered across his face until he understood my question. He undid the button at the end of his sleeve and pulled the cuff up to his elbow, revealing eight names. "These are the names of the kids I haven't found yet, the oldest, this one right here near the wrist would be 19 now. It's a reminder that they're still out there, somewhere, and I still need to find them." His demeanor was cold, as though I had opened a wound simply to pour salt in it. He forcefully brought the cuff of his shirt back down to his wrist, and continued his questions. "Is there anywhere that your son likes to play?"

"There's a small wooded area that him and some of the neighbor kids like to play, right behind the house, but he knows the rules. He's always home long before sundown."

"Which kids does he play with?"

"There's a couple of kids across the street, Jaden and Robert, Robert is Timmy's age and I think Jaden is 2 years older, I'm not sure though. Both good kids, Jaden is the one who helps Timmy keep track of time so he doesn't get in trouble."

Jaden and Robert were excited when my late wife and I had moved into this neighborhood a couple years ago, I think they had grown sick of only having each other, so when Junior was added into the picture, they were ecstatic. The three of them were very fast friends, and so naturally I became well acquainted with Zachary and Sarah, Jaden and Robert's parents. We had all learned to rely on each other in regards to the kids, it takes a village and all that. The boys routinely had sleepovers and Zachary and Sarah were always happy to work around my schedule, as I work two jobs to bring in enough money to support Junior and I.

One of the uniformed cops walked up to detective Callahan and whispered something into his ear, the detective thanked the man and sent him on his way. "Thank you, Mr. McCarthy, the dogs are here, you're welcome to join."

I simply nodded in response.

The hounds were brought to the back of the house, right underneath Junior's window. The trainer gave the dogs his shoe, and they immediately began tracking his scent, and to my horror, they began running straight into the woods. We followed the dogs through the woods that I knew my son was familiar with, and although I knew Junior knew the land around our home, I felt fear bubble up inside of me.

The abyss of fear and anxiety that had planted its seeds inside of my stomach that morning when I found the open window had grown and spread like wild fear. Each step that we took into the woods only served to accelerate its growth. It wasn't long until I began to recognize where we were going, Fort JRT.

Fort JRT was a project that Zachary and I had undertaken one summer, with the boys playing in the woods so often we decided to give them a base of operations of sorts. They absolutely adored it, the boys could never agree on a name until Zachary suggested they named it after themselves, Jaden, Robert and Timmy, thus the name was born. It's a small cabin-like structure with dirt floors and empty spaces in the walls where a door and windows should be. As it came into view I prayed that Junior had simply run off to play in the fort, visions of a reunion danced in my head, I pictured picking up my son as tears welled in my eyes, blurring the fort that was now a mere 20 feet in front of me.

I sprinted past the dogs and into the fort, as fast as my legs would take me, I yelled out for my son, and when I entered, it was empty. I called out again, my voice now significantly softer. Nothing. My voice broke as I made yet another feeble attempt to say his name. Salty tears began to flow freely down my face, liquid grief. My son was gone, lost somewhere, he'd never been away from home for longer than a night, and even then he was only across the street. My mind raced as I attempted to imagine his fear.

Somewhere behind me I heard the distinct whines of the dogs. The trainer set the shoe in front of the dogs' noses once more, and in response they all laid down. A look of confusion beset the trainer's face, before he looked at the detective, "This is where the scent ends."

"That can't be right. Start looking around, see if you can find anything." Callahan barked his orders with conviction.

I fell to my knees, crying like I never had before, not even after Jane's death, that pain was horrific, but this was truly insurmountable. I stayed there, motionless for what seemed like hours until I heard somebody call out for the detective.

I sprinted towards the voice, where I met a normal uniformed cop and the detective.

Snagged on a low hanging tree branch was a piece of fabric, with an image of Spiderman.

Pictures of the area were taken and the fabric was put into a plastic evidence baggy. I took detective Callahan's business card, he told me he'd keep in touch as the investigation carried on, and I returned to an empty, soulless house.

My son's name is Timothy Allen McCarthy Jr. he's 5 years old, he has light brown hair, green eyes, and he's 3 feet 9 inches tall. He went missing in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. Please, help me bring him home.

I'll post any and all updates here and in subsequent posts if need be.
