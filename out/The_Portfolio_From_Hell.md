I used to think investing was about numbers, trends, and logic. But after what I experienced, I know now that the market isn’t just driven by data—it’s haunted by something far darker.

It started when I found The Black Ledger. That wasn’t its real name, of course. It was just an old, dusty book on investing I picked up at a used bookstore downtown. The place smelled like mildew and forgotten things. I had been looking for books on technical analysis, but this one—bound in cracked black leather with no author listed—caught my eye.

I should have put it back.

The First Trade

The book wasn’t like other investment guides. There were no charts, no rational explanations—just obscure, archaic advice that seemed… wrong. Phrases like:

"To see the future, one must be willing to lose the present."

"Blood on the ledger leads to gold in the vault."

"The market is alive, and it does not forget."


Despite how eerie it was, I couldn’t put it down. It whispered to me in a way no book ever had. And then, on the last page, there was a name: Red Hollow Capital.

I had never heard of it before, and I spent hours searching online. There was nothing. No website, no record, no history. But when I opened my brokerage account the next morning, there it was—Red Hollow Capital—listed as a new fund available for investment.

I don’t remember signing up.

Profits... at a Price

I bought in, putting half my savings into it. The moment I clicked “Confirm Trade,” my screen flickered. The power surged. I laughed it off.

The next morning, the stock had skyrocketed. 200% gains overnight.

I was ecstatic. I’d never made money that fast. But then I saw the news—there had been a terrible accident at a major factory overseas. Hundreds dead. The company involved? One of Red Hollow’s top holdings.

I felt a pang of guilt, but I told myself it was just coincidence.

Then it happened again. Another major investment in Red Hollow’s portfolio surged 300% in two days—right after its biggest competitor suffered a devastating fire.

I should have sold everything right then. But the greed…the pull…was stronger.

The Ledger Moves

That night, I woke to a notification on my phone. My brokerage app was open. A trade had been placed.

SELL EVERYTHING.

My hands were shaking as I tried to cancel the order, but it was locked. I couldn’t change it. Then my bedroom lights flickered, and the sound of static filled the air.

I turned. The Black Ledger was on my desk. Open. A new line had appeared on the last page:

"The debt is due."

I heard a click. My laptop screen refreshed. My portfolio balance was zero.

Gone. Everything.

Red Hollow Comes Collecting

I tried calling my broker, but no one picked up. The company’s website was…different. Glitching. Every time I refreshed, the same message appeared:

"YOU SIGNED THE LEDGER."

Then the emails started. Cryptic messages from an unknown sender.

“You made your profit. Now, pay your share.”

“The market never gives without taking.”

“Your balance is settled in blood.”


I tried to get help. I went back to the bookstore, but it was gone. Just an empty lot, as if it had never existed.

And then… the accidents started happening.

People around me—colleagues, friends—getting hurt. One by one. As if Red Hollow was reclaiming the debt.

Final Balance

I’m writing this now as a warning. If you ever come across The Black Ledger, burn it.

If you ever see Red Hollow Capital in your investment account, don’t buy in.

Because once you do, there’s no escape.

And the market… always collects.
