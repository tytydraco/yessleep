**I recently discovered memories long buried by my brain as I was going through old journals. I am terrified by remembering that any of this happened but reading my own notes it came back to me clear as day. If anyone in this community has had similarly weird experiences with the ICE541 from Berlin to Cologne or at all, please reach out to me. I am pretty sure I am not insane but I would like to be completely sure. I typed the entry up as it was, as I wrote i then and after immediatly rejected the memory of it.** 

Five more minutes, and I walk briskly because running isn’t an option. In my right hand, I carry a brown paper bag with travel provisions, still uncertain whether it wants to give in to the relentless rain or not. It’s okay, take your time. The huge beige travel backpack on my back feels like a wild animal has jumped onto me. It pulls me slightly backward, giving me a taste of the pain that muscle soreness will bring later. Four minutes. I storm through the main entrance of the gigantic train station, my black shoulder bag swinging against my legs with every step. It’s filled with notebooks, headphones, and other things to keep me occupied on a long train ride. I wear it over my backpack straps, and it bites into the muscle between my neck and shoulder on the left side. Sweat. It cools my back and armpits— a noble gesture in this humid summer weather, but I would have been fine without it.

Platform 13. Platform 13, and I barely dare to look at my watch. Instead, I glance left, right, and up, hoping to find some kind of sign pointing me in the right direction.

No time to waste, no time for anything, not even orientation. I keep moving deeper into the station, against the flow of arriving travelers. I probably won’t find Platform 13 next to Platforms 1 and 2. Not like a kiosk, a bakery, or a flower shop, all vying for the attention of passersby with their bright signs. Keep going.

Three minutes left when I check my watch again. I take a detour around a line of people waiting for the Sanifair restroom, a line so long it stretches into the main walkway despite the tucked-away location of the toilets.

It’s a jerky stop-and-go; I dodge people, but they don’t dodge me, and every time, the weight of my bags tugs at me.

With two minutes left, I rush up the stairs to Platform 13, but I don’t allow myself to relax until I reach the top. Just a little further… aaaand done!

I throw my bags onto the nearest seat and collapse onto it myself. The final minute ticks away, and the journey begins. I have no idea that there was a platform change and that I am now on the wrong train.

As we depart, it is midday, but the heavy gray clouds make it feel much darker. The rain lashes against the windows as if furious that it can’t pummel me directly. Soon, the steel structures of the station are behind us, and I finally relax.

Seven hours ahead of me— no transfers, few people, just a lot of time on the train.

From my seat, I can see one of the screens meant to display travel information. But like nearly all of its kind, it’s malfunctioning. Most of the time, it’s just a blank blue screen, then occasionally black. Sometimes, it shows half an image of trees, a white block of text beneath it, but all of it is lost in a chaotic mess of colorful rectangles.

Oh well, whatever.

I want to pass the time online, but the train has other plans. The Wi-Fi is useless because there’s simply nothing to connect to. No signal. Too bad.

Not that I have anything important to do, but now I have to entertain myself in a different, less digital way. I shove my headphones into my ears and look forward to the same (way too short) playlist of downloaded songs I saved for exactly these kinds of moments.

65%, my phone’s status bar informs me. That’s still okay, but a little more battery wouldn’t hurt. I rummage through my shoulder bag for my charger, and in the process, a pencil case tumbles out. Annoyed, I shove it back in. One thing at a time.

First, I pick a song (Car Wash by Rose Royce), then I try to get some power. But— another disappointment. My phone won’t charge. I unplug and replug everything, blow dust from both ends of the cable, try again— nothing. Maybe this dead zone is actually the best time to conserve battery. My optimism is just a cover for my irritation. I glance up. A few seats away, two guys are sitting across from each other, talking. Or something like that— it looks more like one of them is talking at the other. But the dominant speaker has something plugged into a charger, so either the outlets over there work, or he just hasn’t noticed they don’t.

I scan the carriage for other free seats where I could test a plug without moving all my stuff.

Plenty of spots to my left would be open if not for the passengers who dumped their luggage onto them— suitcases nearly as big as I am. Their plastic shells glare at me in toxic pinks, greens, and yellows, like an oversized pack of highlighters. I can’t tell who they belong to, and after a moment of hesitation, I simply move two rows forward.

I worry about my bags. Partly because I estimate the next stop is still about an hour away, but mostly because I can’t imagine my stuff looks valuable enough for a thief to care.

Oh— except for my shoulder bag. Small enough to grab, containing my wallet, keys, bank cards, IDs… yeah, yeah, I’ll go get it.

I get up again. The few passengers who are paying attention watch me. As I step forward to grab my bag without fully sitting back down, I notice a tiny, wrinkled woman with snow-white hair sitting next to one of the massive suitcases (the left one). Either they’re hers, or someone has parked her in completely.

She looks up at me and beams.

Maybe being boxed in isn’t so bad.

Dark blotches, almost like bruises, cover her cheeks and forehead, and her mouth is nearly toothless. A polite smile spreads across my face as I grab my bag and head back to my second seat.

Does this plug work? No. Or… maybe? No. Ah, classic loose connection. After some trial and error, I figure out the exact angle I need to hold my phone at to make it charge.

Now I’m sitting much closer to the two guys in the four-seater, where their intense but one-sided conversation is still happening.

Sorry, headphones. Sorry, *Stay* by Oingo Boingo.

The urge to eavesdrop is just too strong.

From here, I can see them better. Out of the corner of my eye, of course.

The quiet one has brown skin and gray hair. He looks tired, his large eyes shadowed by dark circles.

"Do you understand? That’s the problem," explains the other—a pale guy around 20, with greasy, shiny hair and round glasses, Harry Potter style. He wears a vest made of dark fabric, which gleams under the white light of the train's overhead lamps.

"We pay far too little attention to the elements, but that’s exactly what life is about—studying and mastering them. I did that. I'm a master of the elements. At least today. And a survivalist, too. You wouldn't believe all the things I am. I'm also an apprentice to a blacksmith, that’s right. And a connoisseur of women. And an appreciator of the high arts—not everyone can claim that."

I’m not prepared for a single one of these sentences, but I keep listening. Above our heads, the display panels flicker. I've almost forgotten my phone. The Silent One remains still, staring at the master of elements. There are still plenty of free seats—if it got too much for the Silent One, he could just move.

But maybe this is a battle of mental strength.

"I like being a blacksmith. Everyone has their thing, right? As a blacksmith, the hammer is the ultimate tool, you see? That, and the elements, of course. I used to be like you—I know what it's like. But today, I see myself as a bringer of light. That’s what my name means, after all. My mother put thought into it when she blessed me with it, and I want to live up to that. So, this is very important—listen."

I listen, Mr. Bringer of Light. He speaks without pause, without punctuation, but with eccentric fervor. And now, after some rummaging, also with a tuna sandwich in his hand.

"Money is so important, never forget that. Not ever. In this capitalist landscape of ours, I mean. Super important. You need money for food, for shelter, for clothes, even for friends sometimes. It’s sad, but true. But—and this is the important part—love. Loving the world is the most important thing. And, of course, people. People are weird, aren’t they? Weak, too. I always say, people are like milk cartons—if you stab them, something comes out."

At this point, I glance over, unrestrained. The master of elements takes a hearty bite of his sandwich. The Silent One looks over at me. His gaze locks onto mine, and I flinch. His large eyes look dead—completely lifeless, almost milky. He stares through me, nodding slowly, as if giving a signal to someone behind me.

I glance uneasily at the tuna enthusiast. If he keeps talking like this, he’ll definitely end up as a milk carton himself.

I try to listen without looking while my phone charges. By the time the next stop is announced, my battery is at 90%, and I sink back into my seat. Inside the train, it’s so bright compared to the outside that there’s no point in looking out—unless you press your nose against the glass.

I have no idea which city we just stopped in. It wasn’t announced.

Two new passengers enter the carriage—a man with wild, knotted hair and a confused expression, lugging a massive leather suitcase, and a woman, mid-forties, wearing a fringed cocktail dress and extravagant makeup. Her face is swollen, and a blood vessel has burst in one eye. Aside from a small handbag, she has no luggage.

She takes a seat directly in front of me, while the man with the messy hair struggles with loose papers spilling from his half-open suitcase as he approaches me, more or less intentionally.

"That’s my seat," he croaks, tugging at his gray turtleneck, sending more little notes fluttering down, which he hurriedly gathers. I get the feeling his suitcase lock is broken.

"I have a reservation here," he whines.

"This is my regular seat. I need it."

I slowly stand up, keeping my eyes on the guy, thinking that having a "regular seat" on a train should be the least of his concerns. I gather my things while he settles in, visibly relieved.

"May I sit here?" I ask the woman in the cocktail dress, though her bloodshot eye gives me a queasy feeling.

"Of course, sweetheart." Her voice is cheerful, but there’s a strange gurgle in it.

"Thanks."

I squeeze my large backpack into the overhead compartment.

"Don’t mind getting booted," she says. "That guy would throw his own mother off a reserved seat." She exhales sharply, making a hissing sound.

"You know each other?" I ask, reaching for an apple from my snack bag.

"Casually," she sighs. "Chester Dorian—oh, excuse me—Doctor Chester Dorian. He’s a writer. Met him once at a party hosted by Helen Torrance. You know Helen, don’t you?"

I nod. Helen is a well-known actress. I just saw her last month on the big screen in *Seal and Vault*. A powerhouse performance. I’m also pretty sure I’ve seen the name Chester Dorian in one of my many bookstore wanderings.

"By the way, I’m Mimi B. Oxford," she says, winking as if I should recognize the name. But I’m not even sure that’s her real name. Someone *famous* wouldn’t be riding the same train as me, would they?

Mimi B. Oxford leans in—way too close. Her perfume is so strong, my eyes start to water. I’m certain the scent is meant to mask alcohol.

"Honestly, that guy is nuts. They say he strangles himself until he hallucinates—just to get new ideas for his books. Must be a near-death experience every time, the way he’s wired."

She looks at me expectantly. The only thing that escapes my lips is: "Ohh, wow."

Apparently, that’s enough. She leans back again. Outside the window, still nothing but darkness.

"Helen throws amazing parties. The atmosphere, every time! Her rooftop terrace is incredible—she’s even got a pool up there," Mimi gushes. It sounds like an advertisement on Helen Torrance’s behalf.

"Really? Sounds dreamy," I say, hoping my voice doesn’t betray how little I care.

"Where are you headed?" I ask instead.

For a moment, she looks confused—almost strained—then shrugs.

"A friend is picking me up."

"Yeah, but—"

"I’ve taken so many trains, every station sounds familiar eventually. She wrote it down for me, I made a note. Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’ll manage."

Well, that’s reassuring.

"Okay. Hope you have a great time with your friend." Overhead, a light flickers. Mimi beams at me.

"Theodora Goldmann. It’s Theodora Goldmann, the matriarch of the Goldmann Company."

She looks out the window, as if giving me time to react accordingly. And I am, in fact, impressed by how well-connected Miss Mimi B. Oxford seems to be.

The Goldmann Company started out making porcelain ages ago and now sells glass and plastic products, too—high-quality stuff. I own a few Goldmann plates myself. My grandma gave them to me when I moved out. Hildegard swears by Goldmann—nothing else enters her home.

I remember how sad she was last year when news broke that a Goldmann had passed away. She follows the family’s life with royal fanaticism.

But I’m pretty sure those heartbreaking headlines about the rich and famous were about Theodora herself. I could be wrong (I *must* be, if Mimi insists she’s picking her up), but I *swear* that was the hook in those articles.

I don’t bring it up. Not my world, and bringing up a friend’s supposed death wouldn’t be very tactful.

"Which carriage are we in, anyway?" Mimi asks absently.

"Should be five," I reply.

"Six. We’re in carriage six," croaks a voice from behind a pink suitcase. Oh. Well then.

When I finish my apple, I head off to find a bathroom. Before I leave, I notice—Mimi is barefoot. The gray carpet around her feet looks damp, like she’s standing in a small puddle. But it’s probably just a shadow.

The door at the end of the carriage hisses as it opens and closes. For a moment, I stand between 6 and 7, and the rushing noise is so loud it startles me. And it’s cold, oh God, it’s so cold. For a second, my muscles refuse to function properly, and it feels like this icy wind is seeping into the very spaces between my tendons. Another hiss of a door, and I find myself in Carriage 7, where the next restroom is located at the far end.

“What is that?! What is that?!” a man shouts as I pass him. I hold onto every seatback I can reach to avoid toppling over in the rattling train.

“What?” I ask, more out of reflex than any real desire to talk to him.

“I’m not talking to you,” he huffs and glares at me. Then he looks sad. Then angry again.

“Once I get to Reno, this won’t happen to me anymore. Never again. What the hell? I was on time.”

He keeps grumbling into his beard, staring out the window. I get the sense that the fog outside is thinning, and where the gray clouds allow, I think I can see faint rays of sunlight.

“Seven! Seven years she was gone, just because I… I wasn’t on time. See you in Reno, Barbie.”

Something about the people on this train makes for an eerily high rate of nonsensical rambling. A shiver creeps up my spine.

Carriage 7 is much more crowded than good old Carriage 6—almost every seat is occupied. In the stark white light of the long-distance train, everyone looks pale. The ones who aren’t moving resemble wax figures.

I glance down at myself. Not wax. Not yet.

A woman is standing in front of the restroom door. She has a face like a weasel. Something about her looks distinctly marten-like.

“Are you waiting, too?” I ask, and suddenly, this whole journey makes me feel very tired. She looks left, then right, over and over, as if following a table tennis match with her eyes.

“Yes,” she squeaks abruptly.

I nod. There’s another monitor on the wall beside the restroom door, flickering nonsense across its screen. This growing sense of disorientation is starting to plant nervousness in me.

The woman with the weasel face brushes blonde strands out of her eyes and taps the screen frantically.

“You see it too, don’t you? They don’t want us to know where we’re going,” she whispers, agitated. I’m quickly running out of patience for the strange people on this trip.

“They who?”

“The government, intelligence agencies, the Freemasons—it’s all one big mess. There’s only one true authority.”

The more she speaks, the quieter she gets. But apparently, she can’t help herself from going on.

“And they don’t want us to know where we are?”

“Yes, yes, exactly!” she hisses.

“Because…?”

“Because then we have to rely on them! To tell us where to go, where we’re headed, everything!”

“Aren’t you relying on them anyway by taking the train routes they provide?”

“Normally, I don’t do this, but sometimes you don’t have a choice.”

So the government doesn’t want me to know I’m going to Cologne. I see.

The door opens, and out steps a person who visibly startles at the sight of us. The weasel woman darts into the cabin, the small color panel on the lock switching from green to red. For a moment, I get a look at the startled person’s face as I glance downward—they’re a good head and a half shorter than me. And I see, behind their long, thin hair, so sparse that their white scalp is clearly visible, not just fear in their eyes but outright terror.

“Are you okay?” I ask, and my counterpart flinches so violently that I jolt a little too.

“Yes, no, I mean… I don’t actually want to be here.”

That answer throws me. What does one even say to that? “Oh, um. I’m sorry. Do you have much longer to go?”

“We still have a few hours.”

Before I can ask if they need anything (not that I really have anything to offer), the small, fear-stricken person looks like they’re about to be sick and quickly vanishes again.

At least they’re not traveling alone… We only have a few hours left. How much longer do I even have to go?

I’m not really worried about missing my stop—my destination is the final station.

The restroom door swings open again, and the woman with the weasel face steps out, coming uncomfortably close to me.

“I checked the mirrors. They’re safe. Unless they’ve developed a new technique to make them.”

As if she’s startled herself, she whips her head around again, quickly peering back into the restroom stall, its plastic fixtures staring back expectantly.

“Oh. Thanks. Very thorough,” I assure her, trying to squeeze past in the narrow hallway.

“Sometimes you have to do it yourself before they can,” she murmurs so quietly that I wonder if I imagined it.

I have never been so relieved to lock a door behind me. I let out a sigh that sounds downright pitiful. But everything’s fine, right? It’s just… strange. The whole thing. Yet my stomach twists, curling up and tickling every organ inside me. It’s not fine—I just don’t know what *it* is.

I sit on the closed toilet lid and pull my phone from my bag. No Wi-Fi. No signal. Either still not working or not working *again*—but does it even matter? My reflection in the mirror looks blurred, like an oil painting of me. The glass is covered in greasy fingerprints, some smudged into tiny clouds. If all of these belong to Weasel Face, then she’s certainly thorough—but maybe she should rethink the priority list of her concerns regarding the state.

Just as I tear a piece of toilet paper from the roll, the announcement comes through.

“Next stop—” And it cuts off again.

At the same moment, the door separating me from the eccentric rest of the train slides open.

I instinctively grab the handle, pulling it back with all my strength, mumbling an apology—but the person who opened it is a small child now standing right in the doorway.

They’re covered in dirt, twigs and leaves tangled in their hair. Dressed in orange overalls, with only one filthy shoe on their feet. The train is slowing down, preparing for an actual stop.

“Occu—uhhh. The bathroom’s occupied.”

I push the door, gently nudging the child back into the hallway.

Then I lock it again and plant my foot against the door while washing my hands under the sad little trickle of water the train provides.

When I step out, the child is gone—but a bit of dirt lingers on the carpeted floor. A shiver crawls over my skin, and I hurry out of Carriage 7.

I check the time on my phone. 3:33 PM. That can’t be right. That was the departure time.

At the far end of the carriage, before the rows of seats begin, there are windows on both sides. This time, I press my face against one of them. It’s darker. No—brighter. No—just foggier? It’s not raining anymore, that much I’m sure of, but right now, I almost *wish* it were.

Back at my seat, I can’t calm down. My heart is hammering, erratic, like the last Tic Tac rattling inside an empty box. I can’t change that, but I try to slow my breath, get it under control.

“You alright, darling? You look pale,” Mimi asks. Before I can answer, she cuts me off.

“Oh—do you not have a ticket?” Her eyes widen. Someone without a ticket on a long-distance train is prime gossip. She grabs my forearm with her long fingers, the plastic *clack* of her cherry-red acrylic nails sounding distant, unnatural. Her palm feels cold and artificial against my skin.

I whip my head around, avoiding her bloodshot gaze, and nod hastily.

“Yeah, yeah. Just realized—I forgot to buy one. Maybe I can still get one from the conductor or something.”

I stand up, shaking Mimi off.

“Oh, I’m sure,” she giggles.

I stumble back into the aisle, this time heading toward Carriage 5. I’ll keep walking until I find a railway employee who can tell me where we *actually* are, when we’ll reach Cologne, and, ideally, what the hell is *wrong* with these people.

Between the carriages, in the hissing jaws of this multi-mouthed beast, the biting cold wind returns. It roars so loud that I press my hands over my ears, my arms jerking up mechanically despite the temporary muscle paralysis.

How can something be *this* cold? Why isn’t there a warning for this?

When I step into the warmth of the next carriage, it already feels like none of it ever happened—or like I’m exaggerating. I shake myself, as if that might bring clarity. I should’ve had breakfast, that’s all. Drank more water. Gotten more sleep. How cold could it have *really* been? It’s late summer, for god’s sake.

Carriage 5 is sparsely occupied. To my relief, it looks utterly ordinary. The others do, too, but I *need* to find comfort in that. I allow myself to.

Maybe I should sit down for a moment before looking for someone who can help?

The thought barely forms before I realize I’m already standing in the middle of the carriage, just one step away from the seat I *swear* I reserved.

But someone else is sitting there.

An utterly average-looking guy, listening to music through large, gray headphones. On his folding table lies a physics book and a battered orange highlighter. I wouldn’t even dare estimate how old that thing is.

While I linger in indecision, he suddenly looks up—and something in his expression shifts, like recognition.

“You’re on the wrong train,” he says.

That’s when I notice his right arm is in a stabilizing sling.

“No, I don’t think so. This is actually my seat—I reserved it. But you can stay, I—”

“You’re on the wrong train,” he repeats, face deadly serious.

Above us, the display boards flicker, changing from the tree advertisement to a new white screen, where letters emerge in pixelated chaos. I *think* I recognize the names of two cities. They’re arranged like a game of Hangman.

I have no idea how this guy thinks he knows where I’m supposed to be going—but maybe he can answer at least *some* of my questions.

“So this isn’t the ICE 541 to Cologne?”

“Yes and no.”

The music stops.

Frustration bursts out of me—I’ve had my *fill* of cryptic, unnerving nonsense for today, haven’t I?!

“Yes and no?! What the hell is that supposed to mean? I’m really *not* in the mood for a riddle. Yes or no?!”

He looks around briefly, his expression uncertain. No one else seems particularly interested in our conversation, yet he stands up, and I instinctively take a step back—he’s taller than me but has to stoop slightly to avoid hitting the overhead luggage rack.

"Would you mind coming with me for a moment? Just to one of the private compartments? I can explain everything, really. But not here."

"No, thanks. Definitely not. I'm going to find a conductor or some other train staff who can tell me exactly where we are right now."

"I wouldn't do that if I were you. They’ll throw you off the train."

"I have a ticket, and I even reserved the seat you were just sitting in."

He rubs his face with his uninjured hand.

"No, you didn’t. Because this isn’t your train."

"So, it’s not? You’re telling me this isn’t the train from Berlin to Cologne?" I try to simplify his nonsensical ramblings, but he won’t let up.

"How about this: You come with me to the family compartment—it has glass walls and can't be locked, by the way—and listen to what I have to say. And if, after that, you still want to ask a conductor, you can report me to them. Then they’ll throw *me* off the train."

I hesitate, but aside from the things he's saying, he seems completely rational. Though that in itself is unsettling. But then I see the desperation on his face, and I glance at his injured arm. My brain convinces me that it's unlikely this guy is going to attack me in a family compartment.

"Okay, but explain it as quickly as possible."

He nods, and we walk to the part of the carriage with a few private compartments. They’re all empty and, thanks to their glass doors and walls, look like terrariums awaiting new inhabitants after renovations.

We sit down in the family compartment. Two picture books rest on the small table between the facing seats. The carpet here isn’t just gray—it has a pattern of animal motifs in various shades of gray. An elephant, a lion, a crocodile, and a monkey in an endless loop, as far as the carpet extends.

I close the glass door behind us. He sits by the window, which is covered by a pulled-down shade.

I take the seat by the door, arms crossed, one eyebrow raised in anticipation.

"So?" I say as he takes a deep breath.

"Geographically, we *should* be on the right route," he concedes with a nod.

"But on a different plane."

He stacks his uninjured hand atop the one in the sling.

"Listen, I’m really not in the mood for—"

"It’s a journey to the afterlife."

"What?" I say, wiping sweat from my furrowed brow. But I cut him off before he can answer.

"No," I state firmly, locking eyes with his brown, deer-like gaze.

"No, we are *not* traveling to the afterlife. We are traveling from Berlin to Cologne. I don’t know what’s up with the people on this train today, why all of *you* feel the need to share some bizarre conspiracy theory with me, but all I want to know is when we’ll arrive at the final station."

I speak quietly but firmly, very firmly, practically spitting the words at his feet.

"This is ridiculous."

"Don’t you think you should reconsider what’s been happening on this train? The lack of reception, the broken display boards, or the *unbelievable* cold between the carriages? What else could be that cold, if not *this*?"

"But I’m not dead."

"Correct. And it’s obvious. That’s why I know you don’t belong here. Just think about how—"

I shake my head.

"No, I don’t *want* to think about any of this," I say truthfully and stand up. Enough of this amateur theater.

"I was shot for knowing too much."

"Very funny."

"No," he says, irritated. "It’s not funny at all."

Then he pulls off his bulky over-ear headphones, and I’m sure I’m about to throw up.

Only his earlobe is still fully recognizable. Above that, there’s nothing but a shredded mess of cartilage framing a gory hole. I can’t see anything inside except a few glistening spots—light reflecting off fluids and wet tissue.

A scream escapes me, and I want nothing more than to look away. But I can’t. I lose myself in that black void until he puts the headphones back on.

If this isn't real, these people are going to *insane* lengths to put on a show.

"What about the other side?" I ask before I can stop myself, risking putting my foot in my mouth on this ghost train.

"The bullet is still lodged in there."

"In your head?" Another stupid question. That’s enough.

"Yes, in my head. Where else?"

I shrug, and for a moment, silence settles between us. The only sounds are the rush of the wind outside and the rhythmic clicking of the train—like the mechanical breathing of a machine. But I push the thought of comparing the train to something alive as far away as possible.

"How do you know that? Or rather, how do you *think* you know that?" I speak cautiously—if this really is some bizarre, overly elaborate joke, I don’t want to look too gullible on a hidden camera later.

"My grandfather told me. He was in a coma for five days, and when he woke up and had recovered enough, he wouldn’t stop talking about a train ride. About other passengers. About how he got off at the second stop after explaining to the conductor that, of course, he didn’t have a ticket—he didn’t even know where he was supposed to be going. But I think a lot of people here don’t know at first. Or they don’t *want* to know.

When he woke up, he was out of it for a while. He told me the story many times and always said, ‘Now I know—it’s just a long train ride.’ He always liked traveling by train. But he said that when his time finally came, they should pack compression socks in his coffin.

Of course, no one believed him. But I was a kid back then. That story stuck with me, and before I moved away, I planned to ask the priest in my hometown what he thought about it. I used to be pretty religious, but after the priest shot me, I’m *fairly* sure religion exists just to cover this up."

I stare at him, feeling the train air dry out my open mouth as my brain struggles, like an overloaded computer, to process the information dumped on me.

"A priest shot you?"

"Yep."

"For talking about a train—why did he even *have* a gun?"

He shrugs.

"Shooting club or something."

"And he just kept it in the church?"

"It was at his house. He just took it out of his gun cabinet and—"

"Why were you even at his house?"

"To ask him—That’s not the point right now."

Apparently, a gunshot wound is a sore subject.

"Sorry… And if they throw me off, would I just land back on my *own* plane?"

He shakes his head and pulls up the window shade.

"Does this look like *your* plane?"

I don’t need to press my face against the glass again to know that outside, there’s only thick fog, stretching all the way to the horizon, where it hands off a baton to a gray-black cloud cover. Somewhere behind it, the sun must be shining—its rays pierce through the clouds like skewers.

"No."

"There’s just *nothing*," he says, voice unsteady as he gazes outside.

"And then what? How did your grandfather get back?"

Another shrug.

"Once they realized he was a coma patient without a ticket, they just let him off at the second station, and he woke up."

"Then I’ll just get off at the next stop," I say, suspecting this might be a *very* flawed plan.

"I don’t know if it’s that simple," he admits quietly.

"But that’s all I can tell you."

He stands up and leaves the compartment. I stay put for a long while—it feels better than going back to the open seating area.

The rational part of my brain wants nothing more than to hear the punchline of this joke so everything can go back to normal. But the rest of me is too consumed by a creeping panic to do anything.

I feel like a spinning propeller moving so fast it looks like a still plate. From the outside, I must seem perfectly calm.

*What now?*

I glance around, and suddenly, the small compartment feels enormous while the endless train shrinks to something fragile, stretched too thin, until I’m just sitting in my family-friendly box floating somewhere out there in *nothingness.*

My gaze drifts to the window, where *something* rushes past—something that is *nothing.* And I can’t breathe.

If this keeps up, they might just hand me a ticket.

Then my focus shifts, and for a moment, all I see is my own tired reflection in the glass. My short hair is tousled, forming a look that might pass for stylishly messy. But the rest of me doesn’t look stylish. It looks exhausted. Reckless.

The person in the window and I both shrug, weighed down by invisible burdens, and it hurts. For a second, it feels like my backpack has never let me rest.

*What now? What now?*

The possibility that I’m trapped in a half-lucid nightmare flickers like a tiny candle in the dark corners of my mind.

*Maybe I should just try to fall asleep, and when I wake up, everything will be normal again. I’ll be on the right train, heading home. Or maybe there’s a logical explanation. There has to be one.*

My thoughts keep circling around the abstract theory of the ghost train, as if trying to find an answer, but I resist. What nonsense. What utter bullshit. This is just a train.

In my mind’s eye, I see the gunshot wound in all its gory detail, and my stomach lurches.

For a second, I want to look outside again, just to distract myself. It’s my first impulse. But I don’t dare.

When I pull out my phone again, everything is the same as before—no signal, and the time is still stuck at 3:33 PM.

"Next stop—"

The moment I hear it, I jump up, only to hesitate, standing there, uncertain.

This could be my chance.

Even if this is some kind of twisted prank, *getting off* is still a better option than staying.

Stress washes over me. I press my palms against my face, and tears drip into them.

After a deep, growling groan of frustration, I collect myself, wipe my face, and make my decision.

Back to car 6. Grab my things. Get out. Get away. *Goodbye.*

At the door between carriages, I hesitate.

The memory of the cold lingers in my muscles.

The train slows, easing into a stop somewhere. I *have* to go through.

But I only manage to move when I hear a voice behind me, calm and deep, yet cold enough to freeze my blood.

I think I feel goosebumps inside my *organs* as I hear the words:

"Good afternoon. Tickets, please."

All the way at the start of car 5, the conductor stands tall. Every piece of his uniform is pitch black.
