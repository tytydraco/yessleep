Dear Online Journal,

&#x200B;

I’ll try my best to write exactly what happened today from memory. But today got really weird. Somehow more interesting than Mike getting shanked in the butt yesterday.

&#x200B;

My dad’s house, in my room, 4:30 AM.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t sleep much last night. Not because of the amount of ice cream and soda I had to “mourn” Mike’s perfect buttcheek being unfortunately ruined. But because of Thompson’s creepy stare he had when I was running out of the Cafe yesterday. He has the world’s creepiest eyes. How could I ever forget them? When Mike was discharged he was told to keep it easy and take the antibiotics, and pain meds of course, on the regular. He was joking about overdosing on the meds, until his dad decided to softly poke his injured buttcheek for that very-not-funny-to-him joke. This made Mike yelp and grab a handful of that cheek, which ended in him screaming silently while a single tear leaves his eye. Isaac couldn’t help but laugh at Mike’s pain, it was pretty funny. We had a sleep over at my place. My dad made sure that Mike was comfortable and had easy access to the bathroom. I can tell you for a fact that Mike tried to hold in every fart and shit because it was too painful to let them out.

&#x200B;

He told me and Isaac about a technique he figured out while he was in the bathroom. We couldn’t stop laughing at Mike because he was so serious about it. Mike said he had to softly hold his cheeks apart, crouch over the toilet bowl, then –this is his words not mine– unleash the painful chaos he has been holding in since he ate that Chicken Chalupa from Taco Bell. He was looking straight into our eyes while saying this unhinged sentence as seriously as possible. I couldn’t breathe for a while.We woke up this morning to some really bad news, or good news. It depends on how you see it. Specifically bad news for Isaac. But to everyone who thought it was definitely Thompson. It wasn’t. It was actually fucking Mandy. The Thompson-is-forever, goody-two-shoes, four-eyed, teacher’s pet. Isaac shook his head in denial and disbelief, he actually liked Mandy, Mike and I knew he had a crush on her. Of course Mike tried to make him like anyone else other than Mandy, but Isaac has always liked her since 5th grade, so it's been difficult to get him to like anyone else.

&#x200B;

By the way, Mike’s mom got off with a slap on the wrist from the cops. And an expensive fine to pay with an upcoming court date with the criminal justice system because she violated her parole. Karma is a queen that I worship when she does right by someone. Almost getting kicked in the shins with 6 inch heels wasn’t as funny as I thought it would be, but still entertaining. Mike’s dad told us everything about it.

&#x200B;

7:15 AM, on our way to school in Ms. Weatherly’s car, she picked us up.

&#x200B;

When Ms. Weatherly drove us to school, she told us about the footage she was able to find. And she said that we weren't going to like what she had to show. Honestly, she was right. I really didn’t like the news at all. Ms. Weatherly practically did something illegal, but she sent the found footage to herself with an excuse that she wanted to show Mandy what she did was wrong, if Mandy were to ever deny it. She was going to do that either way, even if she wasn’t going to show us the video. But what I saw truly made my blood fucking boil. Ms. Weatherly handed me her phone to watch the video. Isaac and Mike crowded around me in the backseat. Isaac was closer because Mike was sitting his poor butt on a pillow. He’s going to school with us, although I believe he should be resting at home. But Mike is determined to keep up his perfect attendance, injured buttcheek or not.

&#x200B;

During the first Lunch, after Isaac left to refill his water bottle and Mike and I got in line to get some worse-than-prison-food garbage.

&#x200B;

Mandy and her girlfriends, or female friends, were walking by our usual table. One of her friends decided to slap her on the shoulder, conveniently causing Mandy to drop her huge yoga lunch bag. It looked like she told them to keep going, while the friend who slapped her shoulder stayed behind to “help” pick up her stuff. They were crouched down next to the seat Mike usually sits on. From what we saw, Mandy opened a small case filled with those replaceable box cutter blades. Which would explain why a piece broke off into Mike’s now ruined bakery.

&#x200B;

Mandy’s friend handed her a very small bottle. I know what it is because Isaac gasped in realization. He said his sister uses that stuff all the time for her miniatures hobby, it was Gorilla Super Glue. Mandy fucking super glued a box cutter blade to Mike’s seat. I always thought she was a jerk, but this takes it to the next level. Now I feel guilty for ever accusing Thompson for this in the first place. But then again, he could’ve put Mandy up to this. Or not. There are so many questions and possibilities to think about.

&#x200B;

And if anyone was wondering how Isaac didn’t notice the blade. Do you look at a seat you already sat in like a moment before? Cause I don’t. Why would anyone mess with a lunch table seat? You don’t mess with it. You take it when it’s loose and nobody is looking. A lunch table souvenir.

&#x200B;

7:22 AM, in the Gym, bottom bleachers.

&#x200B;

Mike and Isaac began to talk about Destiny 2 and the current campaign. They just decided the case was open and shut after watching the video. But I was thinking about how to confront Mandy in Geometry class today. She can’t just do this and think she could get away with it. Then, the Vice Principal walked into the Gym and asked for Mandy James to come to him. Everyone began to ooh and aah at the mention of her name from the Vice. I hate when everyone does that, it’s really stupid. Mandy shuffled her way from the top bleachers down towards the Vice Principal. She was in real trouble now because the school officer was following right behind them as they walked out of the Gym. I couldn’t help but make an excuse to get a drink of water. In reality, I was following them closely. I chose that one warm water fountain near the Counselor’s office. I’m lucky those offices were close to the Gym and the car rider drop-off. Or else, what I was doing would look really weird and suspicious.What I heard next really shocked me because it sounded all too real and genuine. When Mandy got questioned for what she did to Mike, she sounded super confused. Like she was appalled at the fact that she ever did such a thing. And she denied every second of it. Until, she was shown the video. How do I know she was shown the video? She screamed in shock and frustration. Denying everything and saying she couldn’t remember anything at all. It was super freakin’ weird, dude. Because I definitely remember seeing what happened on the video. Mandy and her friend did it, plain and simple.

&#x200B;

The fact she was denying it was surprising to me. She’s either one of the best actresses in the world or she genuinely doesn’t remember ever doing it. I finished “drinking” from the water fountain and returned to my seat in the Gym. I told Mike and Isaac about Mandy and her meeting. Someone must have overheard me because when we were dismissed to our lockers, I couldn’t help but overhear other hushed whispers about what Mandy had done to Mike. I think I just accidentally, single handedly, ruined Mandy’s goody-two-shoes reputation. I kind of don’t hate her right now. I feel sorry for her. And extremely guilty for not talking a little quieter. She sounded really scared in the Counselor’s office.

&#x200B;

1st class of the day. Mrs. Johnson’s History class, back of the classroom.

&#x200B;

Someone taps me on the shoulder. I turn around and see Gabriel Alonso, and he is one huge bastard. People always thought of him as a bully, but that’s not him. He’s the epitome of a gentle giant. I wouldn’t be passing Mrs. Johnson’s History class if it weren’t for him.

&#x200B;

“Hey, Austin, I heard about Mandy. If you want to talk to her friend, she sits right next to me,” Gabriel mumbled to himself, looking down at his feet. If you want any information about anything, Gabe is your guy. He’s reliable and has “connections,” in the sense that they’re all students from different grades.

&#x200B;

“Why’re you telling me this, Gabe?” I questioned him, how does he know which one of Mandy’s friends did it?

&#x200B;

"Because knowing you since 2nd grade, you won’t live this down until you figure out what exactly happened. And you'd hate me if I didn’t tell you.”

&#x200B;

“Alright, lead me to her. What’s her name by the way? I don’t know her.”

&#x200B;

“It’s Ansley.” Gabe replied while leading me to the far side of the classroom.

&#x200B;

“Ainsley?”

&#x200B;

“No, it’s Ann-s-lee.”

&#x200B;

The History lesson today finished early, so a lot of students are just talking with each other. Or messing around on their phones. But Ansley was sitting by herself, chromebook open to the online study guide, writing down notes in her notebook. She looks sad, almost depressed even, like she just saw someone she loved die in front of her. The grim look on her face was really unsettling. Then, Gabe decided to clear his throat, moving her attention away from her notes and onto us.

&#x200B;

“What do you want, Austin?” She glared at me angrily, how does she even know who I am? I didn’t know her like a second ago. I wanted to ask her a few questions about what Mandy did, but I only asked her one.

&#x200B;

“Do you remember what you and Mandy did yesterday?”

&#x200B;

She looked at me in shock. Like I was the only person who could understand her sadness. No, not sadness, but her confusion in having a gap in her memory. Ansley was glaring at me suspiciously. She closed her chromebook, looked around the room, then gestured for us to sit around her. Gabe and I leaned closely to hear what she had to say next. Then, Ansley began to whisper to us what she could remember, and what happened to Mandy after the meeting.

&#x200B;

“Mandy got sent home today, she got suspended for two weeks. Neither of us can remember what happened yesterday, and we’re kind of freaking out about it,” Ansley looked as if she was going to cry at the moment. But she continued to tell us more.

&#x200B;

“Before we blacked out, or whatever, we were walking down the hallway to the Cafe. Then, Mr. Thompson asked for us to wait for a moment. That’s when he started to talk in some weird fucking language? I don’t know, but whatever he did was some witchcraft bullshit. I mean, he probably drugged us at some point. I can’t explain it because I don’t remember anything! If you know something about this Austin, please tell me. I know I’m going to be next up for suspension. I can’t stop thinking about yesterday, it’s like everything went by in a blur. Like an acid trip, or something.”Gabe and I just looked at her in disbelief, Gabe a little more surprised than me. But now I know for sure that Thompson had something to do with this. I have to come up with a plan before Friday. I think I should make a visit to the library today. I’ll text my dad about that later. But something else really got me thinking today, it was what Gabe had to say next.

&#x200B;

“That sounds exactly like what happened to Cooper Moore three years ago,” Ansley looked at Gabe in confusion, I just shook my head and mouthed to him, “Who?”

&#x200B;

“Cooper Moore was this big brother figure in high school before he dropped out. He did this one prank that almost killed a man. I was a Freshman at the time when all this went down. By the way, I have no idea what you heard about the prank, but it definitely wasn’t a custodian that nearly died all those years ago. It was actually Mr. Thompson who almost got killed. Mr. Constance was the one to find Mr. Thompson, I have no clue why he would ever claim it was him who nearly died.”

&#x200B;

This is the most I have ever heard Gabe talk. He’s like Ferb from ‘Phineas and Ferb’. One sentence a day, then he’s reached his quota for talking. But things are just getting even weirder. Thompson was the one who had a heart attack? How did Ms. Weatherly get that information wrong? She’s been here for like 5 or 6 years now? I need to get this straight. Thompson nearly dies, Cooper Moore drops out, then Mr. Constance is the one claiming he almost died. Then, Gabe answers what I’ve been thinking about, what happened afterwards that caused Cooper to drop out, and how it was even related to Mandy and Ansley.

&#x200B;

“Mr. Thompson got Cooper suspended for at least three or four weeks. During his suspension people have been wondering if he actually was the one who pulled off the prank. Then, the second Cooper came back, absolutely everyone just targeted him and started saying some nasty things about him. Even I said some things about him. Although, I really thought of him as a brother. None of us Seniors can remember exactly what happened, or what was said about Cooper. It’s just this small blank space in all of our memories. I don’t know why I was such an asshole back then, but I regret it to this day…”

&#x200B;

Gabe stopped talking for a moment. Everything was silent in the classroom. You know that build up of noise, then everyone just stops talking for some reason? That’s what happened today. Everyone was turned around in their seats, staring at Gabe, silently listening to his story. A lot of us in this class are either Freshman or Sophomores, so we really don’t hear much about what happened in the past years from Seniors. In fact, hearing this much from Gabe is really haunting. Sure Cooper messed up and almost killed Thompson, which he is unfortunately still alive as we all know, but for him to get immediately shitted on the second he steps foot in this school? What happened to Cooper, or to the students here, that caused so much hate? Even from Gabe of all people, and he’s the type of guy who doesn’t really hate anyone, he’s all zen life and stuff.

&#x200B;

I look around the room, everyone seems to be uneasy and nervous, then they return to what they were doing before. A couple of students were nervously laughing about the silence that happened. Gabe coughs into his fist, clears his throat loudly, and tries to stutter out a conclusion to his story. However, the school bell rang, dismissing our class. Ansley looks at Gabe and I apologetically, stuffing her things into her arms to get to her next class. She hands me a note held between two of her fingers, I grab it without a second thought. Gabe says he’ll text me later, then he walks away out of the classroom. Things just got a whole lot worse, and I don’t know what to do.

&#x200B;

2nd class of the day. Mr. Thompson’s Geometry class.

&#x200B;

Mike and I sat all the way in the back corner of the classroom, away from Thompson’s watchful eyes. I decided to tell him everything from first block. What Gabe told me about Cooper Moore, Ansley not remembering anything, and Thompson being the one who was a victim of a prank gone wrong. He looked at me as if I were crazy, then he just nodded his head as if he understood me. I knew he was just as confused as I was.

&#x200B;

“So, what’re we gonna do, Austin? It sounds like Thompson is actually a magical werewolf,” Mike wondered that last part out loud. Why is he still stuck on Thompson being a werewolf? They should have more hair than what Thompson has.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know, Michael. We’re gonna have to do some major research at the public library. Think your dad would be okay with that?” Mike did a double take at me, then laughed once.

&#x200B;

“I guess this is actually serious if you’re using my full name. Dude, of course I’m all in! I wanna figure out this werewolf–”

&#x200B;

“Could you stop with the werewolf theory already!? Thompson would have to be mad hairy to be one, don’t you think?”

&#x200B;

Mike laughed loudly, wheezing a few times, then he took a few deep breaths. He wiped at his eyes and looked at me, giving me a lazy smile. Suddenly, Mike’s smile immediately disappeared. He was looking over my shoulder. I quickly turned around and saw Thompson standing above me. I wonder how much of our conversation he heard because he would definitely give us another detention for it.

&#x200B;

“Having another conversation during class? Maybe you two should head down to the library if you can’t keep quiet. Students who missed the exam yesterday are taking the test today. I recommend leaving, now,” He glares at us for a few seconds, then stalks off to his desk. That definitely sent shivers down my spine. Thank you, Thompson.

&#x200B;

School library. First floor.

&#x200B;

Mike and I saw Isaac in the back of the library. So, we sped walk our way around the bookshelves to get to the computers in the back. We sat on either side of Isaac, Mike made sure to look down at the seat, he even planted his hand on the seat to make sure nothing would stab him again. He was probably going through this entire day cautiously looking for little blades in his seats. Finally, he softly planted himself on the seat and slowly scooted himself closer to Isaac. We made a plan to create a group chat with Ansley and Gabe. I already had Gabe’s number, but I needed Ansley’s.

&#x200B;

“Oh, shit! Guys, the paper!” I realized something and exclaimed it out loud to my friends.

&#x200B;

“What paper?” Isaac asked me, flinching away from my sudden realization.

&#x200B;

I started to pat myself down, looking for the piece of paper. I found it in my back pocket, so I pulled it out and flipped it open. There was Ansley’s number in the middle of the paper, written in neat handwriting. Mike was the one who created the group chat because I forgot my phone in Thompson’s classroom. I don’t want to run back to that room alone. Especially not for a phone. I told Mike Gabe’s phone number from memory. Afterwards, we discussed with Ansley and Gabe about our plan to meet at the Public library. They both agreed to meet us there right after school ended.

&#x200B;

I’ll probably have to end this online journal here. It’s getting a bit long. I’ll just say what we discovered today in tomorrow’s online journal, merging the two things as one. I want to keep things within a 9 or 10 page limit. But I can tell you now that things will make more sense tomorrow than it did today.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

&#x200B;

Austin Davis
