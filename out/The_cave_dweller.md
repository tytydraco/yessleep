MARCH 22 2025
When I was a kid I always hated living out in the middle of the desert, while we did have neighbors they were sparse and for the most part creepy. I lived in the same city up until about 15 with my sister Kat, my mom Sam, and my dad Warren. My dad was a very energetic man who was a hard worker and a family man, other than that, there wasn’t much to him. My mom was a big believer in the supernatural, the mystical, you know like crystals and astrology and stuff. And my sister was pretty much never in the house. Always out with friends doing god knows what, especially in this bfe town.

Also there was my best friend Donovan, I never said it but I thought that was a stupid name, so luckily when he introduced himself to me he used the name Don. I had known him since at least 1st grade and like I said we had a hard time finding things to do other than play in the little cave near the park.
The cave wasn’t much, it only went back into the foothill about 8 yards until it was blocked off by some old wooden boards. There was a lot of graffiti on the walls, me and Don would pretend we were cavemen looking at our cave paintings, the immersion being broken slightly by empty beer bottles and cigarette butts. The cave also had a weird species of moth in it. When me and Don looked up the moth we couldn’t find anything. They were dark brown with eerily white stripes down the wings almost as if they were glowing. The stripes paired with the distinctive glowing tips on the antennae made the mouths look like a smiling face in the dark. Creepy looking back on it, especially taking into account why they existed, but at the time me and Don thought it was the funniest thing on earth, we would chase the moths for hours as they loudly fluttered around the cave.

JANUARY 04 2015
Today me and Don got in trubble at school today, we were throwing wood chips at the fence. And I think that’s stupid because the wood chips werent even hitting anybody and me and Don were gonna clean it all up when the bell rang. But we got send back to class before that could happen. When the rest of class got back from recess I saw a girl i had never seen before. She was the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen. I didnt talk to her at all yet but I want to tomorrow because she was so pretty.

Also after school me and Don went to the cave and played until the sun touched the top of the trees. I saw the girl walking home while we were playing but I still didnt talk to her because Don was there and I wanted to wait. We were mostly in the cave but sometimes we went to the playground next to the cave. Almost when we were gonna leave to go home me and Don got close to the wood and we looked through the cracks and saw a funny looking moth. And that was weird because I had never seen a moth that looked like that before and Don didn’t ether. 

JANUARY 05 2015
Today when I woke up I couldn’t movie and I got really scared but it only happened for a few seconds and when I told my mom she said it was called sleep puralasis, I hope it doesn’t happen again because I didn’t like it.

When I got to school I saw the girl again and it was before Don got there. He always got to school late. So I talked to the girl and she said her name but I forgot what it is. And she said that her favorite thing Is hello Kitty so I told her that I know what that is and now I have to learn what that is with out her knowing. But I got to see her up close and she was even prettier than before.

Also after school me and Don went to the cave to play. I saw the girl walking again but this time we smiled at each other and waved. Don saw the girl and me smile and waved at each other and when she was past walking past us he treated me. And that made me upset but I was still nice to him cause hes my best friend.
Me and Don also saw one of those funny moths on the other side of the wood again.

JANUARY 06 2015
Today I had sleep pluralasis again. It felt like it went on for longer than yesterday but it was still just 2 or 3 seconds. I dont like it when that happens. My mom looked confused when I told her it happened again and i think thats weird because it only happened 2 times but maybe its probably just because she had it happen before and she knows its scary. I hope she hasnt. I don’t want my mom to be scared.

Today at school I talked to the girl again and I remembered her name this time its rilee. I think that’s a pretty name. I forgot to look up hello Kitty yesterday after I got home from the cave so I asked her about her. She said that shes lived here forever just like me but also she said that she was home schooled and I think that’s cool because you don’t have to get dressed and you can stay in your pajamas and you can eat when ever you want. Rilee said that shes happy to be at school so she can meet nice people like me and that made me happy because I want to be a nice person to her.

After school we went out to dinner so I couldnt play at the cave with Don and I couldnt see rilee walk home. So I found her before I walked home so I could say bye.

After we got home from dinner my mom got me a new nightlight to put in my room because of my sleep puralasis. 

JANUARY 07 2015
Today when I woke up I had sleep puralasis again but it didnt even last for very long and my nightlight made it look really bright so I wasnt scared. And I told my mom that and I could tell it made her happy so that made me happy.

Today at school we had partners but the teacher didnt let us pick partners and she picked us ones instead. She didnt pair me with Don so I was kinda sad but she didnt pair me with rilee so I was happy about that. Rilees super smart and she helped me a lot with the project we had to do. 

After school me and Don went to the cave again and I saw rilee walking home abcs I waved to her ands she waved to me. Don made fun of me again but I know it’s just because hes my friend so I was still nice to him. We mostly played at the park and not the cave because when we went into the cave the moth was on the other side of the wood where we play and it looks funny but it scared us because we didnt  see it and it started flying at us and it made really loud sounds when it flew.

JANUARY 08 2015
Today when I woke up I had sleep puralasis again and the nightlight helped again and it didnt last very long again.

Today at school nothing really cool happened except that I talked to rilee again and also I forgot to look up hello Kitty last night but its okay because I think rilee knows that I dont know what it is and she trys to talk about other stuff with me and that makes me happy.

After school me and Don played at the park again and we also played at the cave more because when we went into there we were ready to find the moth so when it started flying around it didnt scare us really. Also I saw rilee walking home again and I waved to her and she waved to me. When me and Don were in the cave playing and playing with the moth we went up to the wood again and we saw another moth and thats weird because I never even heard of this kind of moth before and now im seeing a bunch of them.

When I got home today I talked to my mom about the moths and I asked her to look them up because I never heard of them before and she couldnt find anything about them. Also I remembered to look up hello Kitty and so now I can talk to rilee more.

JANUARY 09 2015
Today when I woke up I had sleep puralasis again and all the other times when I told my mom about it she said I was lucky because for most people they see scary things when it happens and that kinda happend but not really. Because I saw something that wasn’t there but it wasnt scary. It was the moth and it was right where my nightlight is and instead of being the normal yellowish whiteish light it was the yellowish smile that the moth makes 

Today at school Don didnt come but thats not weird because he doesnt always come to school on fridays. And also i talked to rilee about hello Kitty and I could tell that it made her so happy and that makes me so happy. I also told rilee about the moths that me and Don see and when I told her I think she thought they were scary because she was more quiet in the day and she was looking down and around her shoulder a lot. I wont talk about the moths with her again.

Today after school I played with Don at the cave and the playground and he was already there because he didnt go to school. I also saw rilee walking home and she waved at me but it looked like she was waking after like she was trying to get past. I hope she just needed to get home and not that shes mad at me.

MARCH 22 2025
If you couldn’t tell that was a transcription of my journal from 2015, that must’ve been around 1st grade. That one week was the threshold for the rest of my life, nothing was the same after. I didn’t stop having sleep paralysis, and after a few weeks of the nightlight mostly helping it only kept getting worse. Me and Riley are still together, to be honest shes the only reason I’m still alive, she’s the only person who’s been able to console me after Don died, and after what I saw.

MAY 14 2019
My sleep paralysis was so pretty when I woke up today. There were so many smiling moths flying around in the craziest patterns. It still only lasted a few seconds, that hasn’t changed since they started. But they aren’t scary anymore. 

At school I didn’t do much actual work, it’s not that I didn’t have any to do but I didn’t really want to do it. Don had to stay after school because he was missing so much work, I hope that that doesn’t happen to me maybe I should start doing work at school. I still miss Riley so much. I can still call and text her but I wish I still got to see her at school. 

After school I went to the cave to play but Don wasn’t there because he had to stay to do work, I knew he wasn’t gonna do any but the school made him stay anyway. Since I didn’t have anyone to play with I just sat around on my phone in the cave. Surprisingly it still works in there. 
I was on my phone when I heard the distinct fluttering of the smiling moths, i smiled and walked over to the wooden boards and looked through. Behind them I saw what I usually saw: small stalactites, spiderwebs, and the smiling moths. I watched the moths dancing around the bigger portion of the cave forgetting about my phone, the world outside the cave, even Riley a little bit. That’s when I heard something unlike the flirting of the moths that I’ve come to know so much. I heard a long shrill, half human, half something else, scream. I had never run so fast in my life. I ran home almost forgetting my phone but once I was back I felt safe. 
My mom asked me what happened and I explained the whole thing. She assumed that I still had my headphones in and was hearing something from my phone. But I know that’s not the case. I know what I heard.

MAY 16 2019
Today when I woke up  my sleep paralysis scared me for the first time in a long time. The moths danced in the air in swirling patterns for a few seconds when behind them I saw something. I saw something tall with a big glowing smile. I only saw it for half a second before I woke up. 

Today at school we had a test on math and I hope I did good at it because I haven’t really been trying very hard on what we’re doing in there. Even if I did bad it probably won’t be too bad that I won’t be able to get a good final grade on it with corrections tomorrow. Also at school I thought about Riley a lot because she was always good at math. Shes so smart. I hope she comes back to this school. 

Today after school Don didnt have to stay late because it’s Wednesday and so we played at the cave and at the playground for a while I told him about the sound I heard yesterday and I think he beloved me because he seemed scared and didnt want to go near the boards a lot and wanted us to play on the playground mostly.

MAY 18 2019
I forgot to write in this yesterday but not a lot happened. I did good on my corrections and got 83% on the test. I talked to Riley a lot on the phone while I was at the cave cause Don had to stay late after school. 

But this morning I woke up and I had a similar sleep paralysis as to yesterday and the day before. With the dancing moths hiding a tall smiling figure. 

At school today we watched a movie because it was Friday and Mrs. Nichols didn’t feel like giving us a whole thing to do, ecspecialy because we all mostly did good on the test yesterday. We watched duck tales. The old one, from 1990. I love that movie so much my favorite character is the guy who flys the plane. 

After school me and Don played at the playground and the cave but today Don brought a flashlight with him because even though it isn’t really dark in the cave, ecspecialy at the time we play at, you can’t really see very well past the boards. So we looked back there and saw the moths flying around. There were more of them than usual and one stood out to me, because it wasn’t flying. I love watching those moths. It’s so cool to see the patterns they make. It reminds me of my sleep paralysis when it’s not scary.

MARCH 22 2025
Even a few years after things started to get bad I was still so naive about everything going on. And god was i repetitive, like what’s even the point of writing in a journal if every day of your life is practically the same. Oh well, it’s fairly good documentation of the stuff that happened. 

I still miss Don every day. He was the best friend a guy could ask for. Even if we did get into arguments it almost always ended in us laughing. Usually one of us had to meditate, be reasonable, but it worked. I don’t think I’ll ever find a friend like Don again. And if I lose Riley too..

DECEMBER 03 2023
When I woke up today I was greeted again by the cave dweller. It’s starting to feel like I’m not having sleep paralysis anymore. Every time it happens the moths hide him less and less. His features grow more clear.  His deep, heavy breaths. His big glowing smile. His long limbs. His slightly transparent skin that gives me a better view of his heart, lungs, veins and such than I wish to have. Outlined by the nightlight I’ve been forced to sleep with than longer than not. 

At school I scared the shit out of myself when I almost lost my wallet, it turns out that the love of my life Riley had grabbed it for me because I forgot it, hahaha. I don’t know what I would do without her. I swear we’ve got to be doing the most rudimentary shit in math class. And I don’t get how some people can’t grasp what it is. All do respect it’s easy as hell to find the percentage of something. Even easier than spelling percentage apparently. I used to need help from Riley in math but boy really anymore. Shes still way smarter than I am though. 

Today I didn’t go to the cave. I couldn’t. I’ll admit that I was scared. I’ve been seeing the cave dweller so much in my sleep paralysis that when I hallucinate him at the cave it feels too real. I’d rather rot away playing video games with Don than do that.

DECEMBER 04 2023
Today when I woke up the cave dweller looked different, not his features but he was in a different pose, slightly crouched with his arms out a little bit. Almost as if he was about to leap out towards me. Again it only lasted a few seconds. 

Not much happened at school today.. oh yeah, other than Riley kissed me. I’m so happy today. I don’t even care about the cave dweller. All i care to think about is Riley. I blew through the assignment in math today because it was similarly as simple as what we’ve been doing the past 2 weeks so not much to report on curriculum wise. 
I love Riley so much

After school I played video games with Don and texted with Riley. Just like every day. Just a little more special.

DECEMBER 05 2023
Today when I woke up the cave dweller didnt have that smile that he bore for the past, what, year or two. Instead his mouth was gaping open and all of the moths that had left to let him be the star of my sleep paralysis were back, flying chaotically around instead of the synchronized pattern that I once knew.

Today at school Don didnt show up which is kind weird because it’s only a Thursday and he definitely doesn’t have good grades, but who knows. Maybe he had some sort of appointment, or is seeing family.
I obviously talked to Riley all day ecspecialy because Don wasn’t there. 

After school Don never called me to play video games, which is kinda out of character because he calls me pretty much every day but like I said. He’s probably just with family or something. I played video games mostly and texted Riley, and watched podcasts.

DECEMBER 06 2023
Dons dead
I don’t know what happened
He went to the cave and broke through the boards or something and killed himself back there
I don’t know what to do. 
I didn’t have sleep paralysis this morning
The first time in years
I don’t know what’s going on
I didn’t go to school today
I don’t plan on doing so for a while 
I need to talk to Riley
I need to be with her

MARCH 22 2025
It’s been a year or two since that happened
I would transcribe more of my entries but they don’t really add anything, I wasn’t in a good enough headspace to write down anything important. But I do have my memory, and from what I remember what happened doesn’t make any sense. 

They blocked off the cave after they found Don but “they” wasn’t the police, it was fbi. Heavily armored fbi. And at the time I didn’t want to hear this, I still don’t know if I want this information but I heard someone saw Dons body. And it didn’t look like a suicide. It looked mangled. Thrashed apart by long claws. And. I hate to even type this, makes me sick to my stomach thinking of my best friend, but his head, like, bit off. Nothing makes any sense anymore except for Riley. I’m in bed with her now. Yes I know I’m kinda young to be I. Bed with a girl, but give me a break. I’m in love, and I need her right now, because I can’t get over my friends death, and i cant figure out if that tall silhouette with a glowing smile in the widow to the night sky is real or not.
