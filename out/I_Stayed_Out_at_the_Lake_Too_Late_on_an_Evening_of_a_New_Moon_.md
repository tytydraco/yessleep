I was told to be off the land before sundown. The park ranger was very adamant that I had to be gone by then tonight because that’s when the park closed. He really emphasized “tonight” which I thought was strange, but I followed his rule. I was the only person fishing the lake, it was beautiful, and the fish were still biting, but I turned back plenty early. It was a decent walk on the trail because of the way the trail winds around the outer part of the property.  

I just got back to the truck when several vehicles pulled up to the parking area. “What the hell,” I said out loud. I could see the ranger in the entrance gate building, and he just let them through. Then several more came in. So much for the park closing by sundown.  

All the people getting out of the vehicles were elderly folks. I thought, what the hell do these old people need the whole park for, it’s a state park, they don’t deserve the whole thing. I remember thinking some of these small-town people around here think they own all this, but we all do right. So, F ‘em.  

I grabbed my stuff and headed back out to the lake. I had time to get some more good fishing in. I figured no one would even notice I’m there and I REALLY wanted to bring home some keepers. God, I wish I could’ve just left. 

On my way back I decided to go off the trail and cut through a part of the forest. I remember thinking “Is this a good idea?” then continuing on anyway. It really wasn’t that bad at first and I wasn’t carrying that much other than a pole, a small tackle box and a bucket. Though the fish were biting they weren’t big enough to bother bringing home so my bucket was empty. 

The walk started to seem like it was taking a little too long when I noticed the sun was completely gone. The sky was black, it was a clear night and there were stars but there was no moon. As I went further the ground was more and more covered in brush. It was tripping me up. With no light except for stars, only feeling my way through, it was like sinking deeper and deeper. Everything seemed larger or I felt smaller, but I continued on as my instinct told me to.  

I got a strange chill, and I stopped, froze completely, then I threw my gear down and froze again. Everything was silent for a moment. Then I heard a cracking noise. Probably a small animal I thought. I heard the same noise but a little louder and closer. Then crunching and crackling surrounded me. And a large dark figure, the size of a tree, raised from the ground around me. It was like the forest was a giant moving being that had awakened, suddenly and angrily. A deep low growl followed the crunching noise of the branches that were enclosing me. 

And then I was running, my feet taking me so quickly I couldn’t comprehend it beginning. I don’t remember the surroundings just the feeling of the cool air and branches cutting against my face. Then, up a hill, a light. 

There was a small pavilion with lanterns around it and a few picnic tables. People were all around talking casually. It was the old people I had seen earlier. The tables were set up with food and drinks. It was so surreal, but I was too panicked to care. I tried to speak but was too out of breath. “Whoa, where’d you come from?” one person said. Still out of breath I tried to reply. “Sorry couldn’t understand ya buddy” he said before turning away from me, continuing to his conversation with the others at this gathering. It was all very odd and frustrating.  

Then I gathered myself enough to speak, “There is something!” I said while pointing to the woods. Now they all paused their conversations and are looking at me curiously. “Something big is out there” I said. But confusingly to me they all started smiling. I was irritated by them, thinking that they thought I was crazy. “What are you all doing out here anyway? you’ve gotta listen to me!” I said.  

I glanced around at them as they just stared at me. Then they all started moving in a little closer “Okay, okay” one of them said in a trying to be calming but condescending way. His hands motioned a let’s bring it down kind of motion. I was annoyed and looked away from him and glanced over at their picnic table. A shiver went down my spine.  

That’s when I actually got a look at what was on the table. It looked like raw meat. Hunks of flesh in foil pans and Tupperware containers. One with scalps, hair hanging over the side of it and part of a human face inside it.  

They lunged toward me and pulled me to the ground with strength and speed unbelievable for the look of them. An old woman in a giddy voice said, “Our meager offering just got a little more tantalizing.”  

The deep growl came out of the forest behind them louder this time than before. They turned and I broke free and ran. “No!” yelled that woman that was so giddy before, but a man stopped her and snapped, “we have no time, get into place.”  

From a distance I watched a giant figure dark as the night emerge horns or branches coming from it at all sides. They gathered to the sides of the pavilion showing their “offering.” A man stepped forward and said, “Our lord of the New Moon please accept our offering for another month of youth.” The figure engulfed the pavilion but must not have been satisfied. The man that spoke screamed and I could see blood gushing everywhere as if he were squeezed. I ran, found my way to the trail, sprinted the whole way to the parking lot, got in my truck and sped off. 

About a week has passed and that night all seemed like nothing more than a dream. A really messed up dream. In fact, my luck has been pretty good since then. Work is going good, I work in an auto shop and my boss hasn’t been up my ass all week like he usually is. I won $50 on a scratcher. Not much but I’ll take it. And I hit it off with this girl who brought her car in, which never happens to me. 

All seemed great in my week which really had me questioning what I saw. At dinner me and Heather, the girl I met earlier, were really getting along. She laughed at all my jokes which is always a good sign since they really aren’t that funny. Everything was great. Something about her seemed almost familiar. 

We were talking about where the rest of the night should take us. Then she said, “we could just head over to my place.” I was all in. Then she said, “At home I can change into this new thing I bought.” I was choking on my words, just nodding. Then she said, “It might be a little more... tantalizing,” with a giggle. The life fled from my body. 

Her voice, the word tantalizing, the way she said it, it was her. This was the old woman that was in the woods. They knew where to find me. They are probably going to kill me because of what I’ve seen.  

I’m in the restroom of the restaurant now, I think she might know that I know. My exit was less than graceful. I’ve peaked out the door to see if anyone else is watching but I don’t know. I don’t know who to trust that’s why I’m reaching out for someone to believe me. I don’t know who I know that will actually believe me. FML I’m afraid I might be kidnapped and fed to some woodland beast.
