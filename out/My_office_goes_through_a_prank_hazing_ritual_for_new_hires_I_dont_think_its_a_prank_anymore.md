I've been job hunting for a while now, and I received a notice on my phone for a Job interview. It was for a cushy office job for some company I've never heard of before with a decent salary and benefits right near the city. I was beyond excited when I got the offer, and I accepted it right away after they asked me a few basic questions.




The office space is a four story building by itself in the middle of the city I live in. There's a basement used for maintenance but I've never really gone down there. The first floor is mostly just where everyone works while the second floor is the employee recreation area. 


They have a few things like a ping pong table, a bootleg arcade game of some kind and a break room. The third floor where I work is just another working space, the floor above me is unused space used for storage.



The first few weeks were great honestly. I met my co-workers, learned the ropes, and even started to enjoy the work. I talked a lot with the older people in the building since this place didn't have many people my age besides newer hires who didn't have much to say, I always just assumed they were busy at the time like how my supervisors are.



Things started to change after a month of me working there though. They started staring at me more often, whispering behind my back, and avoiding eye contact when I tried to speak to them, or just being incredibly short with me. I sort of brushed it off at first, thinking maybe I had done something wrong being a new girl in an office of older Women and Men who probably had higher expectations for me. 



But as time went on, the behavior only got worse. They stopped talking to me altogether, and I was left feeling isolated. None of them talked and laughed with me about my interests anymore, or talked about the local sports teams with me. Nothing. They just seemed like they didn't want me there anymore.



I tried going to my bosses multiple times but they just told me it was normal, it's a competitive environment and people get stressed often.




One day, my supervisor called me into her office.


She sat me down and explained that there was an "initiation prank" for new hires that happened every month. Apparently, all the new employees had to go through it at some point, and it was supposed to be a team bonding experience. "Learning how to deal with stressful situations and immediate problem solving" As she put it. whatever the fuck that was supposed to mean.


I didn't know what to think. Part of me was scared, but another part of me was curious. After all, I had heard stories from the other newer people about how their pranks could be harmless, even funny when I was listening to their conversation through the cubicle walls.


So, I agreed to go through with it. I didn't really have a choice, It was either that or risk losing my job according to my boss. And besides, I thought, maybe this would be the thing that brought me closer to my distant co-workers. 




Tomorrow after that, things were different.


I was the only one who showed up to the office, I spent the day faxing files and doing a majority of the small work entrusted to me by myself. It was like they were punishing me for being the new hire. I tried calling my boss about it but she didn't pick up the phone.



To make matters worse, I kept hearing strange noises coming from the basement. It sounded like someone was moving around down there moving and scraping something against the vents, but when I went to investigate, there wasn't anyone at all. The whole place gave me the fucking creeps honestly, and I couldn't wait to leave. I locked up later that night around 2 am and made my way to my beat up car.  I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched though. I looked around, but there was no one there. It was just me, the dark parking lot, and the eerie silence.


That was yesterday and todayâ€¦it hasn't been easier. I got to the office this morning and noticed that there were some loud construction noises outside and around the basement.




Usually, the office is bustling with activity by this time, but today besides the occasional clanging of equipment it was quiet. There were only a few people here and they all seemed preoccupied with their work. Even my supervisor, who is usually quite friendly, didn't acknowledge my presence when I walked in. She just scoffed as I tried to shake her hand and ask her how her night was last night.





Earlier today she came over to my desk and just stared at me for minutes, I didn't respond to her just being there nor did I look at her face really, I just got glimpses of her body just peering over my cubicle wall. After twenty minutes I sighed, ready to ask her what she wanted but what I saw freaked me out really badly.


She was smiling at me, not like a normal happy smile but an exaggerated smile. something you'd see a cartoon character do after commiting a crime and getting away with it or something like that.


We stood there for a while like that while everyone else was going home. I blinked occasionally and so did she. But she never dropped that fucking smile, not once.


And then her lips started to move.



"Go home early for today Sarah, we've got something for you tomorrow I think you'd really like."



I practically grabbed my things and lept for the door, wanting to get out of this place as soon as possible but she stopped me.



My supervisor told me that I needed to come into the office tomorrow and not leave my desk until 3 PM. She also warned me not to go near the basement under any circumstances. She said that was where the "prank" would take place, and if I didn't follow her instructions, things could get "messy." 


I thanked her for letting me know and I raced to my car, driving home and going well over the speed limit.




The whole thing felt more like a threat than a practical joke was going to be played on me tomorrow. Maybe they're just messing with me and I'm being paranoid. I mean, some of them started talking to me today, right? It's not like they were acting weird except for when I came in and my boss. I can't stop thinking about tomorrow. I wanted to post this somewhere, get some opinions before I go in tomorrow. If something happens that isn't anything short of a pie to the face I'm leaving and applying somewhere else.
