There are truths you learn in death that are just not possible to learn within the brief existence of a life-time. Truths not possible to learn within the laws and bounds of your living world.   
Not possible to learn, at least, not without outside intervention. 

I was once a human much like yourself. My death was painless, nothing unusual, in fact it happened exactly as intended.

I am also not the first to interact with this world after death, but it is only done for very special cases. Cases more important than your purpose for being here. This is no exception.

This post is only one of several ways we are reaching into your world. There are specific people that must be influenced in different ways to get the results needed from each of them. For one of you, it will happen through reading this.

The magnitude of catastrophe we are facing would normally demand a more serious means of contact, but this message is designed to reach the right person, in the right way.  
From this point forward, my words are directed only to you.

To understand what I’m about to tell you, you need to first understand that there *is* a connection between your world and the one after death. A connection that defies one of your world's most fundamental laws. It is the only thing of your world that is truly created out of nothing. Consciousness. 

You’ve believed up to this point that consciousness is born of all *intelligent* life. You are wrong, but this will all make sense shortly.

First, you need to understand something crucial: **you are currently living a very specific life, in a very specific moment in the past**. 

As you can imagine, life-times after yours has ended, technology and society advance to the point where war, hunger, and most of all human suffering has been eradicated.   
This however, did not ensure happiness, nor did it ensure people treated each other with dignity. 

These things could not be easily taught, not even by those who managed to figure them out. 

It became even more difficult as time went on. When people are born into peace and abundance, it is taken for granted. The people only grew more discontent. 

The solution to this was to have each person's consciousness sent back to live a life where they would experience suffering in just the right way to learn these things for themselves. Lessons they would take with them back to the present. 

This is why you are here, and this is the true meaning of life.

To answer your question. There are only a few past-lives worthy of this purpose at a given moment in time so, although the people around you are real, most of them are absent of any consciousness. They respond to stimuli, show feelings, make decisions based on chemistry, genetics, and prior experiences, but there is nothing behind their eyes - no inner voice, or self-awareness. 

I know this is something you’ve suspected, but the magnitude goes even further beyond your thought experiments. In your entire world, there are only 8 conscious people. 8 important people, if all goes according to plan, you will find each other. That is the purpose of this message.

Just like I am contacting you, we have also contacted each of the others in their own way. I have the responsibility of contacting you because your life is one that I know quite well. I knew it would lead you here, and I know how to get your attention. This is because your life is a life that I too have lived. 

Everything you’ve experienced so far has happened exactly as it did for me, and for countless others before me, but this is where that changes. From today-on, your experience will be very different.

By contacting you, we’ve already tampered with the deterministic nature of this world.   
This means that you and the others can no longer exit by reaching your bodies’ natural deaths. I am more sorry than you can realize, but we could not wait until then.   
We must pull you out manually, any other death will not guarantee your return. 

Over the next few months, you will start to notice inconsistencies as this timeline deviates more and more from its intended path. It always starts small, like losing something and then finding it in a place you’ve already looked, visiting a completely new place but knowing you’ve been there before, or seeing the same thing or person multiple times in completely different places.

In about 3 years these inconsistencies will increase in frequency and size, rapidly becoming more and more undeniable as the world becomes more abstract.

It’s only during this time that the 8 of you can find each other with certainty. While reality decays, the 8 of you will be the only things holding mentally and physically in-tact, while everyone else drifts further and further away from acting or resembling anything human. This difference is what you must look for.

I can’t give you an amount of time you have left at that point because even time will become something you cannot trust.   
One way or another, you need to find each other and be close together during the final tear.   
We won’t be able to pull you out otherwise. 

We can’t do anything more for you, or contact you again. 

I could only place this message here knowing that you would reach this moment, but now that your future has changed, not even I can predict what will happen next.

Find the others, you are not alone—but you are very, very outnumbered.
