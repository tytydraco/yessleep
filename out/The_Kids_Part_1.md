An outstretched ribbon of asphalt separates dual New Mexican deserts, a bowstring silently waiting to deliver a steel arrow to its quarry. At last, it slithers down into a megalithic cauldron hollowed out of the bedrock, carving a descending track hewn with sub-millimeter precision. There the road concludes in culdesac caked in rust-hued dirt that swirls in the geometric shadows of a five-story warehouse surrounded by a platoon of strip-mining machines, temporary buildings, back-hoes, and loaders.

Once-white 18-wheelers crawl down into this pit from its rim, having wafting in on voluminous clouds of dust. The windowless trailers arrive in duos and trios, to be received by four men dressed in unmarked desert fatigues: one pair with clipboards and pistols, the other with HK-416 carbines. After an inspection, the eight-meter roll-up door of the corrugated steel warehouse slowly grinds open and swallows the trucks.

After a spell, the cabs emerge without their trailers, then wind their way back up and out along the steep walls of the fishbowl at inadvisavble speeds. In a wake of sand, I watch them disappear back up over the edge, towards the known. 

Then as the sun sets sienna, a special silence settles over the site—a kind unique to the desert at night, which makes me feel as if loneliness itself was alone. 

--- The Entry

With the trailers deposited inside the towering maws of the warehouse and the cabs departed back to the world of distant civilization, one by one the guards-on-dury unlock and pull open their tailgates. The sandy hinges then screech open, and I switch my active feed to that of the guards' bodycams.

Inside the trailers tends to be pallettes of boxed equipment, interspersed with hooded men and women each held into a high-backed chair by a five-point safety harness. The soldiers lift their hoods and instruct them to unfasten their safety belts, then I watch from the overhead cameras as they file out of their trailers and into the horizontal doors of the large freight elevator that will bring them into the facility.

I have never understood the need for hoods inside a windowless trailer, but also, I have never asked, and I never will.

Once they are all inside the elevator, its double doors close like the jaws of beached megalodon. 

I toggle to the camera inside the elevator. Visible is the surface of the top left wall of the elevator, where a large LCD screen comes to life once the doors are fully closed. As the elevator jolts into slow downward motion, a video plays, and all the people turn to watch and listen.

A picture of Earth as seen from space is displayed, and a man's deep voice begins to lecture.

"Consider the diversity of life on Earth and our extremely unique place within it.

"All organisms native to Earth share a common genetic code: an alphabet where each letter, or codon, is a combination of three RNA nucleotides. Each codon refers to a specific amino acid or it represents an instruction to stop reading the RNA strand. For example, in all organisms on Earth, the codon UAA means 'stop.' 

"From this it is clear all life on Earth is derived from a primordial, common ancestor, since there is no other reason why, in each organism, the same codon should always refer to the same amino acid or stop instruction.

"Yet most earthlings look nothing like humans. Even our closest relative, the chimpanzee, looks and behaves quite differently from homo sapiens in most respects, despite sharing more than 99% of our genes. 

"There once existed Neanderthals and Denisovans—our most similar non-human ancestors. Most anthropologists believe we wiped them out, though there is genetic evidence that homo sapiens interbred with these creatures until they were fully extinct.

"Today, among all forms of Earth life, humans alone have the following combination of traits:
- complex language
- opposable thumbs 
- build and manipulate machines
- wear clothes
- travel in vehicles
- mostly bilateral symmetry 
- four limbs
- upright locomotion
- mostly hairless
- two ears, two eyes

"Now suspending for a moment any doubts you may have about the likelihood of intelligent extra-terrestrial beings travelling to Earth, let alone humans going to an alien homeworld, ask yourself the following questions: 

"How likely is it for humanity to encounter an intelligent extra-terrestrial species who happens to share most of the features that make us unique among earth organisms, from the above list? 

"How likely is it for humanity to encounter an intelligent extra-terrestrial species that shares nothing in common with all earth-based life?

"Indeed, you would be wise (and correct) to assume such a creature to be genetically almost identical to humankind, and to share a common ancestor with us.

"Yet this raises another question: how could an extra-terrestrial being from another planet share a common ancestor with mankind? 

"One possible answer would be that they are not, in fact, ETs at all, but rather, they live on Earth with us. While it seems insane to suggest an entire intelligent, technological species shares Earth with us but has evaded detection from us. 

"However, let us recall a key point. We do not know everything, and much of what we do know is the product of incomplete understandings of physics and biology. Humans make mistakes, and some of them cannot be recovered from. Many of the creatures we see around us are products of human manipulation, but not all. We merely shape the clay a bit. 

"Encountering a humanlike creatute from outside our current area of understanding seems impossible, and yet, as you find when you exit this elevator, it has nonetheless happened. We call them, 'The Kids.'

"Once you enter this facility, you shall never leave it. You have now become a citizen of the Below."

With the video having concluded, I press a small green button to open the elevator door. I watch as the dusty men and women, shell-shocked, shuffle out of the elevator, never to be seen again.
