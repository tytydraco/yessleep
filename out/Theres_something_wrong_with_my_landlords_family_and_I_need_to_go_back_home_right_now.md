 My girlfriend recently broke up with me. I won't lie, that was the most gut-wrenching thing that ever happened to me.   

 She basically lived in my apartment. After the breakup, she had to go there multiple times to pick stuff up, and when I thought I wouldn't be seeing her again, she appeared out of nowhere to pick another thing up. I couldn't keep doing this anymore, so I decided to take some time for myself.   

 I searched a lot of travel destinations online, and couldn't find anything that attracted me enough to actually go and rent it. If it was cheap, the place looked like garbage. If it looked good, the stay was expensive as hell.   

 I was almost giving up on my sabbatical trip when, all of a sudden, an ad popped up on social media, announcing a cottage on the woods. The place looked like it came out of a painting. It had a crystal-clear lake, the trees were so green they seemed unreal. It felt like one of those AI generated images. And it wasn't cheap, but it wasn't expensive either. This almost felt so good to be true, and maybe it was.   

I got there around 8:30 AM. I chose to keep this travel to myself, and didn't warn my parents or anyone. I wanted to fully enjoy my little one-week fantasy. The cottage looked just like the pictures the landlord sent me. We talked a little after I messaged him informing I was interested in renting the place. Through the messages, you could see he was a nice guy. When I got there, the landlord was waiting right in front of the cottage with a happy grin on his face. He helped me unload the car, and it made me laugh seeing him carry a lot of heavy stuff like it was nothing, he was certainly a buff guy. He was about 6'1 and had a long beard.  

 He told me to count on him whenever I needed something, and then informed me that he lived about half a mile from my cottage with his family. He then invited me to lunch at his place. At first, I was a little loth, but he convinced me that they would be really happy to welcome me.   

 I had lunch with his family. The house was so silent that it was possible for you to hear your own organs working. When we sat down at the table, Simon was the only one talking, asking me superficial questions that I answered in an equally superficial way. His wife and daughter were quiet, totally still, and had blank expressions, like their body was there, but nothing more. His wife ate in silence, and his daughter only scrambled the food with a fork, without actually eating anything. She had a black eye and little yellowish bruises on her arms. I tried brushing my thoughts away from it and just kept eating the food.  

 I went back to my cottage after lunch and took a nap. When I woke up, I slowly opened my eyes, and I swear I saw someone staring at me through the window. The cottage had only one floor, so someone could spy on me if they wanted to. The figure bent down so quickly I couldn't see it. I admit I was too scared to look for it, so I just decided that it would be best to just forget it.  

 In that same afternoon, I felt really bored and thought I could see some videos on my cellphone, but there was no signal. I walked around the house, trying to get at least a bit of signal, but nothing happened.  

 I went to Simon's house to ask him for the wi-fi password, and he started laughing. He proceeded to say that there was no need for wi-fi in the woods when there's so much to do instead of scrolling through social media. I kinda agreed with him, and asked if he had any suggestions about what I should do, and he suggested fishing. He told me to go to the back of his cottage, as he kept all the reeds in a shed that was unlocked.  

 When I got to his backyard, I saw the shed and went straight towards it, but I heard a bump on the house's window. I looked towards the bump, and saw what seemed to be Simon's daughter. Her nose was bleeding, and her eyes were wide open, like she'd seen a ghost. She started mumbling something, looking directly to my face. She started pointing at me, seeming desperate. I got goosebumps all over my body, and realized I had to get out of there. Suddenly, Simon's daughter disappeared from the window abruptly, like if someone pulled her back.   
   
 I was still paralyzed, but after a few seconds, Simon showed up and asked me why I was taking so long. I smiled at him and told him I got distracted by a squirrel. I can't tell if he believed me or not, but he let it slide.  

 We spent some while fishing, but I couldn't take my mind away from what I've just witnessed. Was she being abused? Did Simon know about what was happening? He seemed so kind at first.  

 Maybe you'll call me stupid for this, but I ended up confronting Simon about what I saw. He looked at me, concerned, and started tearing up. He told me his daughter, Astrid, was a very sick young woman. She had some kind of schizophrenia, and would constantly try hurting herself and others. He said they moved to this cottage in the middle of the woods so they could keep her safe and stop her from hurting others. I felt so bad for him, and apologized for even thinking that they could be harming her. He told me not to worry.   

 I felt honestly so bad about that family. I went to their house every day at midday so we could lunch together. Simon's wife, Katherine, even talked to me. But on the other hand, Astrid would keep her mouth shut the whole lunch, and would leave the table without saying a word.   

 After four days at the cottage, I started feeling really good about the place. The lack of internet stopped bothering me as I was doing a lot of manual stuff I used to do when younger, like painting and sculpting little things with clay.   

 Simon knocked on the front door while I was drinking some coffee, so I stopped and went towards him. He told me he'd go to town with his wife to buy some more food, and asked kindly if I could keep an eye on Astrid. I agreed, of course. He then gave me the keys to his cottage and told me she'd be in her bedroom. He said that if she called me, which she'd probably do, I should answer with dry and short sentences. He reaffirmed that she was mentally ill, so I should NOT BELIEVE HER. I agreed and went to his place fast since it was almost dark.  

 I was in the couch watching Simon's TV. The channels were all boring, but I wasn't paying attention to it anyway. I couldn't stop thinking about his daughter and how tiring taking care of her everyday should be. Suddenly, I got scattered from my thoughts by a scream. I ran towards Astrid's bedroom, and asked if everything was okay. When she heard my voice, she started yelling something like "thank God you're here". I got confused and asked her what that meant, and she told me to listen to her carefully.  

 Astrid told me Simon and his wife kidnapped her when she was only fifteen, and now she's probably twenty or twenty one. She lived at a perfect family, and her parents loved her more than anything in the entire world. She even told me their names: Mary and August. She said Simon abducted her in the daylight, pointing a switchblade to her neck and demanding that she got inside his truck. He then took her to the cottage and kept her locked in this same room for a long period of time, and only fed her once a day to keep her alive. Simon's wife was also a part of this. She was the one who pulled her away from the window that day. I could see she was crying. That story was too realistic for someone to just make up, and if you were there, you'd agree. Her voice trembling while she talked made my whole body freak out. I had to get her out.  

 Going against everything Simon told me, I opened the door. She was on her knees, her face was totally red and swollen. She then looked me in the eyes, and gave a genuine smile.  

 We sat on the ground together, and planned an escape. I would tell Simon I had to leave early because of some family matters. At midday, I would come around for one last lunch, and bring a glass of wine to "celebrate it", but I'd pour some drops of GHB, a drug that makes you pass out. Simon had GHB in the kitchen's drawer, and Astrid knew he had it because he gave it to her multiple times during these years. At first, I was absolutely terrified and just wanted to get out as soon as I could, but now, my main goal was to help Astrid escape. I could see the suffering through her blue eyes and knew that she was trusting me.   
   
 After Simon and his wife had passed out, I would take Astrid with me and drive her to a police station so she could finally get free. It seemed like a perfect plan, nothing could go wrong. We heard the sound of Simon's truck engine getting close, so she hugged me quickly and kissed my cheek, thanking me another billion of times for helping her. She then got inside of the room again, and I locked the door. When Simon got in, he asked me if Astrid was behaving well, and I told him, confidently: "I actually forgot she was even here". He smiled and shook my hand, thanking me for being such an angel. I faked the best smile I could, and told him not to worry.  

 The next morning, I knew what had to be done. I packed all my things and loaded them into my car without anyone noticing. I took one of my wines and opened it carefully. I took the GHB from Simon's drawer last night, and then poured it inside the glass. I put the cork back to its place and shook the bottle a bit. Just for safety, I took a little switchblade I had and put it inside my back pocket, just in case.  

 Following the plan, I got there at midday, holding the poisoned wine. Simon opened the door and told me they weren't expecting me to come, so his wife didn't make enough food. I told him there was no problem, and that I was there to tell him I was leaving today. He quickly went from blank to sad, and asked me why I was leaving so early, and I told him it was due to some family matters. He invited me in.  

 Simon's wife heated up some lasagna from yesterday for me, apologizing for not making enough food, and I told her it was fine. I sat next to Astrid at the table, and she seemed happy. She even ate the food, something I never saw her doing before.   

 I told Simon to get a wine opener so they could drink it, and he peacefully denied it, alleging that he and his wife didn't enjoy wine. At that moment, the whole plan fell down right to our face. I looked at Astrid from the corner of my eye, and then, she simply said "why don't you drink it yourself?", looking deeply in my eyes.  

 Simon looked at her and agreed, saying I deserved a sip since I've been so helpful to the family. I couldn't figure out what was going on. I said I shouldn't drink because I was going to face the road soon so I could get back home. Simon denied it, saying he would only let me leave after sipping it. I started sobbing and begging him to stop. Astrid looked and me and wiped my tears with her thumbs, and then held my cheeks. She pouted, smiled and whispered "I like the way you're brittle and naive". After that, Simon took the wine and shattered it against my forehead.   

 I woke up in some sort of shed, and I figured out it must be the shed where he kept the reeds. I was sitting down shirtless, tied up to a metallic pole, and couldn't move. I tried screaming, but I don't think someone heard me. It was just me and this fucked up family.   

 I reunited all the strength I had left and stood on my feet, struggling and trying to untie the rope that was wrapping my hands together, but I failed. I started looking around, trying to find any object that could help me escape this hell, but all of the tools were too far from me. Suddenly, I remembered about the switchblade I had inside my back pocket. I rubbed my back against the pole, trying to feel if it was still there or if they took it from me, but I could feel it.   

 I tried reaching it with my tied hands, but I couldn't, no matter how hard I squirmed. The shed's door opened, and the three family members were wearing black covers and animal masks, but each mask was different. One was a lion, one was a deer and the other one was a wolf. I felt like I was in some kind of disturbing horror movie, but it was real.   

 The one with the lion mask, which I suppose was Simon, had a leather bag. He opened it and started taking candles out, making a circle around me. The other two just got on their knees while Simon did all the work. I was still on my feet, flabbergasted. I couldn't even cry. My body was filled with adrenaline, so I kept wiggling, trying to reach my switchblade.   

 "It's too late now", said Simon. "It was nothing personal, you just ended up being an easy prey. Your body will be used as a sacrifice, since you proved to be a good person by agreeing to help Astrid. But don't get me wrong, if you refused to help her you'd still be murdered, but in a much brutal, bloody way. He will eat you slowly. First, he'll whoop your eyes out, then your tongue. Rip your nose and ears off. He will then gut your scalp, then your skin. Nothing will be thrown away, He'll use everything. You should feel pride for serving such an honorable entity. Your sacrifice will keep our family alive for another century."  

 While he said these harsh words, I threw up more than once. The graphic details he gave me were too much to handle. I got a lot of involuntary spasms. But then, I noticed something. The spasms were strong enough to loosen up the rope that wrapped my hands, so I was getting closer to my back pocket, but tried making it stealthy so that none of the family members would notice.   

 "Please, Azazel, accept our sacrifice!" Yelled Simon, and the other two repeated it. Simon started lighting up all the candles around me, and they started heating my feet up so much it throbbed. They came closer and, with a little blade, Simon started to write something on my chest. The pain I felt was so sharp, and I started squealing. I kept struggling, but Simon's wife and Astrid would hold me whenever I started moving too much. I was still trying to reach my switchblade and, after some seconds, I reached it. In a moment of pure despair, I looked at the ground, and felt my feet burning. Then, I did something out of pure instinct: I started kicking all the candles. Immediately, the candles started burning the hay that was on the ground, and also their covers. They all started screaming, and I took my opportunity. I held the switchblade in a position where the blade rubbed against the rope, and started sawing it.   

 Everything inside the shed was on fire since it was made out of wood and hay. They were looking for a way out. Suddenly, a part of the wooden roof gave up and fell on Simon's wife, who screamed in agony until I couldn't hear her scream anymore.   

 While she struggled, I was able to cut the rope entirely, making me free. I ran towards the exit, but Astrid jumped over me and started hitting me with a wooden bat multiple times. The wooden was rotten, so it wasn't able to do much. I held the switchblade with all the force I had, and slit her throat. Blood gushed all over my face and body, making my vision completely red. She didn't die instantly, but she eventually would. I threw her body on the ground and kicked her throat one last time, making her head detach from her torso. There was blood and fire everywhere. I started looking around, trying to find Simon, and I saw him standing right next to his wife's body, trying to wake her up desperately. I saw that as the perfect moment, and ran away towards the shed's exit.   

 I was able to make it out alive, but most of my body had third degree burns. I ran towards my car, and started it as fast as I could, and when I looked behind me, I saw Simon standing in front of the shed, looking directly at me. I hit the gas with all my might, causing the car to skid, but it eventually came back under control. I followed the same road that led me here, and tears of joy rolled through my cheeks. I got out alive!   

 At first, I thought I was safe. But after 15 minutes on the road, I ran out of gas. I was in the middle of nowhere, but at least I had a little bit of signal. I immediately called the cops, explaining my situation. They said that a police car was on its way towards me, but I'm sitting here for nearly three hours now, and no one came to pick me up, and it's starting to get dark. I'm freezing cold. My chest hurts because of what Simon has written with a blade. "Azaz". Only the word "Azaz". It probably meant Azazel, the demon he was trying to feed me to, but I started the fire before he could finish it.   

 I'm trying to keep calm, but I can't stop thinking about Simon standing up in front of the burning shed, staring at me. He was still alive, and he probably was coming after me. I just hope the cops will find me before he does. If someone's reading this, please, never rent a cottage in the middle of nowhere, especially when you're alone.  

 I think I see a light approaching my car, it's probably the police. Weird, I could have sworn the police siren's colors were blue and red.
