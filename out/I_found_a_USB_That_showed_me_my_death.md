It was just another mundane Tuesday evening when I trudged back home, craving a peaceful night’s rest. As I approached my mailbox, buried beneath bills and junk mail, something peculiar caught my eye – a small, unmarked USB drive.

Curiosity wrestled with caution in my mind as I picked it up. No labels, no clue of its origin, just a sinister-looking black USB drive. I couldn’t help but recall the chilling tales I’d read about mysterious USB drives. Against my instincts, I plugged it into my computer.

The USB drive connected, and a single file materialized on my desktop: “WATCH_ME.mp4.” My heart raced, torn between clicking it or not. Against my better judgment, I clicked.

The video that unfolded was a nightmarish scene – me, beaten and bloodied, bound to a chair in a dim, sinister room. A masked figure lurked in the shadows, brandishing menacing tools.

My breath caught as I watched in abject horror. The masked figure subjected me to unspeakable torment, each moment more gruesome than the last. The video continued relentlessly until it reached its harrowing climax – my lifeless body, the masked figure’s eerie laughter echoing in the background.

Panic surged as I tried to delete the video, but it seemed the file had seized control of my computer, mocking my futile efforts.

Days blurred into sleepless nights, and I spiraled into a state of perpetual dread. Eating and resting became impossible, haunted by the nightmarish video. Desperate for answers, I scoured every corner of the internet, seeking any clue or explanation. But all my efforts were in vain; it was as if the video foretold my impending doom.

In my desperation, I sought help from tech experts and psychologists, but they dismissed it as a cruel hoax. Yet, the malevolence of the masked figure in the video felt all too real.

Weeks turned into agonizing months, the torment of the video unrelenting. My health deteriorated, and paranoia consumed my every thought. I knew I had to confront this nightmare head-on. With trembling hands, I dared to enter the ominous room from the video.

What I found there plunged me into madness. The room existed, the chair was real, and the same ominous tools lay scattered about. It was as though I had stepped directly into the horrifying reality of the video.

A faint rustling behind me sent shivers down my spine. I turned, only to see the masked figure, identical to the one in the video, lurking in the shadows. This was no hoax; it was a prophecy. My heart pounded as I realized my fate was sealed, just as the video had foretold.

The masked figure advanced slowly, and I knew there was no escape. As darkness closed in, I accepted the grim reality that this nightmare was all too real, and my end was inevitable.

With every agonizing step, the figure’s laughter grew louder, mingling with my screams until they were one and the same. And then, as the abyss consumed me, I understood the true horror – the USB drive was merely a portal to a realm where nightmares became reality.

I beg you, dear reader, if you find an unmarked USB drive, resist the urge to seek answers, for the darkness it conceals may be more real than you could ever imagine.
