They're still getting everything set up, so I've got some time to get this all out. I need to stay focused. Writing helps. 

I promise, my urgency will make sense in a moment. Just bear with me. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

The first exorcism I ever witnessed happened back in May. 

We were called out to one of the most remote and infamous residences in the area. It's a glorious Queen Anne style mansion hidden away by manicured bushes and an imposing gate. Few people have ever seen the place. All three of us at Orion are among their ranks. It's a shame it wasn't under better circumstances. 

The homeowner had called after barricading herself in their library. It was difficult to hear her over the banging and shouting in the background, but eventually we were able to discern that she’d come home to find that her wife ‘was all wrong.’

At the time, we weren't sure if it was a possession or a replacement, so we hurriedly gathered up the supplies for both. A replacement would've been simpler. For them, you just need to trap the imposter in a circle of salt. After it's done sulking, it’ll tell you where the person that they're masquerading as is located. Most of the time, they don't kill the person. We've even had some replacements voluntarily release their prisoners, wanting to go back to its simple life in the woods having realized that human life isn't all it's cracked up to be. 

Possessions, however, are an entirely different situation altogether. They are one of the most dangerous types of infestations that we deal with. It’s treacherous not only for the victim, but for those around them. 

Once the atypical parasite fully takes over, the host is no longer in control. The parasite will then use the commandeered body to target the host's loved ones in order to sever the host's ties to the physical world in order to finalize the takeover process. At least, that's how Reyna explained it. 

In the past, we've had to refer possessed individuals to the nearby church since neither Victor nor I are well versed in human infestations. Unfortunately, this process can take a while for a few reasons. For one, only one of the priests is ordained with the ability to perform exorcisms. For another, they need to request permission from the bishop in the next town over before taking on the task, which can take a day or two. It has resulted in us having to lock these poor people away from others until the priest is able to get to them. 

Thankfully, human infestations like this are extremely rare. We've only had a few since I've been here. This one is the most recent. Well… soon to be second most recent, I suppose. 

The first thing I noticed when we arrived was that the lights were flickering through the windows. Replacements don't normally mess with electricity, so that was the first clue that wasn't what we’d be dealing with. When we got inside the mansion, we found the client's wife clawing at the library door. She was missing two fingernails on her left hand. Her fingers were raw and bloody from her efforts. She was breathing heavily, her chest heaving from her efforts. 

When she turned to face us, her gaze chilled me. In that moment, it became clear what we were dealing with. Replacements have vacant, dead stares. Meanwhile, this woman was seething, eyes wide, teeth showing in a snarl. 

Reyna's role was to perform the exorcism. Meanwhile, Victor and I were tasked to make sure that the host didn't harm her or anyone else in the process.  

The woman charged us, bloodied hands outstretched. She reached Victor first, grasping for his throat. He let her get close enough to get ahold of her arms, then swiveled her around to pin them behind her back.  

While the possessed woman screeched as she fought him, I went to check on the client. At the same time Reyna made the sign of the cross over herself as she uttered a prayer, then did the same over the struggling woman, causing the woman to let out a grating cry that could've shattered glass from its volume. 

Thankfully, the client was unharmed, but reasonably terrified. I assured her that we could get the parasite out and advised her to stay where she was. The library doors were damaged, but they were holding up well enough. 

The possessed woman then changed tactics. Instead of being violent, she began to sob, begging us to let her go as she quaked in Victor's arms. She cried that he was hurting her. That she was so scared. The client wailed from her hiding spot at the sound of her spouse's suffering. Even though it was a ruse, it was a convincing one. I kept an eye on the client to make sure that she wouldn't fall for it, but thankfully, she seemed smart enough to see through it, though it definitely struck a nerve. 

Reyna was pouring saltwater over the possessed woman as she continued her prayer. The second the water touched the woman's skin, the pitiful act was promptly discarded. She flailed around, her head shaking from side to side violently as her heels battered Victor's shins. He grimaced, but managed to keep her from kicking Reyna. 

I ran over to grab the possessed woman's ankles so that we could carry her over to a fancy-looking chaise nearby. Her skin felt feverish to the touch. If we could just get her secured, it would reduce the risk of her injuring herself or one of us.

The woman began to berate the client, telling her that she was a horrible wife for letting us do this to her. That she was breaking the vows they'd made to each other on their wedding day. Thankfully, once again, the client didn't take the bait. However, she let out an agonized moan as if each word the parasite said to her was a blade cutting into her skin. 

As demonstrated, atypical parasites like this are highly manipulative, willing to say or do whatever they have to in order to maintain their control over the host. If yinz find that a loved one has been infected by one of these parasites, try your best to remind yourself that it's not *them* that's saying those things. Their goal is to isolate the host. Don't let them. 

The woman began to convulse as Reyna continued her work. Frothy spittle ran from the corner of her mouth as she cursed at us, her voice guttural as if the words were being pulled from the deepest, darkest corners of her being. Around us, the lights flickered enough to cause an ache behind my eyes. 

One of the big windows shattered, making me jump. Another followed. I managed to keep my grip on the woman's ankles even as broken glass rained down over my head. Shards bit into the back of my neck as they fell under the collar of my shirt. The client screamed, but I couldn't risk checking on her, knowing that if my concentration faltered for even a moment, all hell could break loose. 

Reyna told Victor to hold the woman's mouth open. I was worried that he would lose a finger. That seemed to be what the possessed woman was going for when she gnashed her teeth at him. He didn't react at all when she chomped down on his thumb. To his credit, he tried to be as gentle as he could when he pried her jaws apart. This might be an odd comparison, but it reminded me of how my mom used to open our cat's mouth when she was caught eating something that she shouldn't be. 

Reyna poured the salt water into the possessed woman's mouth, some of it spilling onto the sides of her cheeks. Before she could spit it out, Victor clamped his palm over her mouth, giving her no other choice but to swallow it. 

Suddenly, her struggles stopped as her eyes rolled into the back of her head, her entire body going limp. 

“Get away from her right now!” Reyna told us, backing away. 

We obliged, both of us watching the woman for any sudden movements. 

The lights continued to flicker. The wind howled through the broken windows. The client took loud, shuddering breaths as she stared at her wife’s unmoving form on the chaise. She weakly called the woman's name. 

For a terrifying moment, I worried that we'd somehow killed her. 

That fear went away when the possessed woman's stomach twitched as she abruptly gagged. She turned to her side, cheeks puffed out as if she were about to vomit. What ejected from her throat instead looked at first to be a red, veiny fetus, covered in sticky fluid. However, the tiny thing didn't have eyes, its proboscis-like mouth whipping around angrily at the loss of its host.  

The woman, now free from its control, could do nothing but whimper as she stared down at the parasite with disbelieving, large eyes. I quickly, but gently pulled her off of the chaise and away from that thing. Her entire body trembled, damp with sweat and saltwater, unable to tear her eyes from the thing that had tormented her and her beloved. 

Right before our eyes, it began to grow bigger. Victor swore. Not giving either of us time to hesitate, I dragged the client's wife to the library and pushed her through the door to join the client, standing guard in front of it. 

At this point, the parasite became the size of a Great Dane. In one bizarre, fluid motion, it was on its malformed legs, which were bowed like a piano’s. Its proboscis swung from side to side as it faced Victor and Reyna, bulbous head twitching repulsively. 

She had the Squelcher drawn, her mouth and eyes huge as the parasite shuffled towards Victor. He simply watched as the proboscis attached to his exposed forearm, only for it to immediately disengage with an infantile shriek. 

Like the viscera-sucker, apparently this parasite didn't like the taste of dead men. 

Victor, seemingly unaffected by all of this, glanced at Reyna and said, “Make sure it doesn't get out the front door. 

He didn't have to tell her twice. She instantly started to back away, only stopping once her spine hit the door. The entire time, she kept that water pistol raised like it was a proper gun. 

The parasite was pissed off, now. It's screech grated on my ears like broken glass scraped against a blackboard. Victor withdrew his silver knife, gaze icy as he stared the parasite down. The lights continued to flicker as the parasite tried to circle him, cooing like an excited newborn. The boss just waited patiently, tracking it with his eyes. 

The parasite’s laugh was childish. The lights cut out again, then when they turned back on, the parasite had changed shape to resemble a person. I say ‘resemble’ because it still had that proboscis waving around. I'm not sure who that man was that the parasite was imitating, but Victor definitely recognized him. He had gone from being intense to outright pissed. 

I'd learn later that the parasite had taken the form of the man that had slit Victor's throat. 

Whatever the parasite had been trying to accomplish with this completely backfired. There was a part of me that kind of felt bad for it. Even before he became a draugr, the boss was *scary* when he got pushed to that point.

The parasite ended up trying to retreat towards the staircase behind it only to have Victor seize its hood. He pulled it back into him, ignoring the proboscis driving itself into his right ear, then dragged the knife across the parasite’s throat. For good measure, he stabbed it in the heart as well.

He let it fall to the ground then dug his heel into the parasite’s skull. I'm trying to find the words to describe the sound it made, but the best that I can come up with is the splattering of a pumpkin dropped on pavement. The visual was similar as well. 

Victor hissed, “See how you like it.”

I think it might've been cathartic for him. I hope so. 

Reyna came over to whisper to me, “Okay, remind me to never piss him off.”

Victor offered to take care of the body while Reyna and I checked on the homeowners. When we entered the library, we found them embracing each other, the client sobbing into her wife's hair. The woman who’d been possessed kept apologizing to her, over and over. 

While she'd been taken over, she'd been aware, trapped helplessly inside of her own body and forced to watch as the parasite used her memories to hurt the one she loved most. She'd heard every horrible thing that the parasite had forced her to say. She'd felt the parasite’s hunger for misery. 

Reyna set up some incense from a kamangyan tree, explaining to the clients that it would help to clear up any residue that the parasite may have left behind. 

Gravely, she then informed the two women, “I don't mean to alarm you, but you need to know that if you've been possessed once, then there's a chance that it can happen again. The good news is that there are measures that you can take to lower those odds. These parasites are attracted to grief, trauma, and pain. Therapy helps, so does having a strong support system. Honestly, just do anything that helps you feel connected to yourself and those that you care about.”

She then described the early symptoms of impending possession so that they'd know what to look for. I will include that description here so that yinz can recognize them as well, should the situation ever come up. 

In the beginning, the victim will experience flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, and migraines. Because these signs are so similar to so many regular illnesses, they're easy to overlook. 

When the woman heard this, she confirmed that she had felt sick, but her doctor couldn't find anything wrong with her. The client looked down guiltily. 

The next stage of possession causes the victim to have issues such as night terrors, sleepwalking, and sleep paralysis. Along with that, auditory and visual hallucinations plague their waking hours. The longer the infestation goes on without treatment, the more these symptoms worsen, eventually driving the victim into delirium. 

The client clutched the woman tighter and gasped, “This is all my fault!”

Her wife shook her head, “Junie…”

The client tearfully confessed that she'd been away on business while her wife was home with what they had thought was the either the flu or COVID. When she returned home from her work trip that evening, that was when the parasite puppeteering her spouse had attacked. She'd called us while running for her life. 

I tried to assure her, “There's no way you could've known that this would happen. As far as you knew, it was just an ordinary sickness.”

The woman laced her fingers with the client’s reassuringly. 

Once the client had calmed down, her spouse numbly asked, “So, this *is* going to happen again?”

Reyna reluctantly said, “It can. I don’t mean to give false hope, but there are some people that can go the rest of their lives without experiencing another possession. Others can be subjected to multiple. The advice I gave you won't guarantee that it'll never happen again, but it'll help lessen that chance. And if it does, you know the signs to look out for so that we can stop it before it gets to the point it did today.”

After we made sure that all of their questions were answered, we took the body to the same burn pit we used for the feathered rats. Before the flames consumed it, Reyna said another prayer before to ensure that it couldn't attach itself to one of us. Victor dumped it in, doused it with lighter fluid, then lit the match. With that, the deed was done. 

So yinz may be wondering: why am I bringing up possessions and exorcisms? 

I woke up a few days ago with a fever and a headache. At first, I thought that the worm bite had gotten infected; it certainly itched enough. The skin around it was bright red and warm to the touch as well. I'd say it was a perfectly reasonable assumption to make, given that Iolo had sucked on my open wound and all.  

By the way, speaking of that particular incident … some of yinz need to take a cold shower. Go to jail and think about what you've done. 

Anyways, I called off of work and made an appointment with my doctor. She said that the bite was irritated, but it was nothing that a topical antibiotic couldn't solve. Besides that, she was puzzled by my symptoms since everything else appeared to be normal. She told me to get some rest and to call her up if it got any worse. 

It did get worse, but not in a way she could help me with. 

On the third day of being sick, I woke up with chills in the middle of the night despite being drenched in sweat. When I opened my eyes, I discovered that the white stag wasn't just in my dreams anymore. It was in the corner of my room.  

At the time, I'd thought that was still dreaming, so I shut my eyes and tried to get comfortable enough to fall asleep again. 

After I finally managed to fade away into unconsciousness, the stag infiltrated one of my usual nightmares. It watched me from under the bloodied petals of the Lovers’ Tree. Its filthy white coat resembled the tree so strongly that it looked like it belonged there. Its strangely shaped head was tilted to the side, its ear twitching thoughtfully as a stained petal floated past.

The longer those pale eyes observed me, the more my hands shook.  

“What do you want?” I asked. 

The white stag snorted as if I should already know the answer. 

I woke up to the Weeper shaking my shoulders, eyes widened in concern. How did I get outside? As bizarre as it sounds, it felt like the forest was calling to me. 

*What is happening to me?*

And as awful as all of that has been, that's not even the worst of it. It's hard to describe, but ever since that day in the mine, there's been a brightness growing inside of me. It feels similar to the flutters of the heart that come before a bout of hysteria. For some reason, this sensation disturbs me more than everything else that I've experienced so far. 

The Weeper brought me back to my apartment and sat with me while I called my coworkers. 

After the mine incident, Victor had ripped me a new one for not doing a good enough job of getting ahold of either him or Reyna before letting the mechanic drag me into danger. He was right to tell me off. I could've gotten myself killed or worse. I'd thought I had a handle on the situation, but clearly, that wasn't the case. I'd been stupid. I can fully admit that. 

I've learned my lesson. I told my coworkers about my symptoms and how my doctor wasn't able to find the cause of them. When I mentioned the brightness, my heart burned as if simply addressing it was enough to encourage its growth. 

The entire time, the white stag was at the edge of my vision, listening to every word of our conversation. It licked its lips at the Weeper. Along with that, there was a consistent buzzing in my ear that was driving me nuts. 

Seemingly unaware of the danger looming in the room, the Weeper took my hand as I'd done for her in the past. 

Victor and Reyna were on their way. They didn't have to say what they thought was happening. I wondered how much longer I had before I was gone. Would it be like how it was for the woman from the mansion? Imprisoned inside of my own body while the stag used it for its own purposes?

Ignoring the buzzing, the brightness, and the white stag's hungry gaze, I figured there was no time like the present to tell the Weeper about something I'd been considering as a way to permanently free her from the river's grasp. If things go south, then I wanted give her that information while I still could. After all that she's done for me, I at least owed her that much. 

“I'd read that keening women who failed to fulfill their duties became Weepers.” I started as she furrowed her brows at me. 

“You want to discuss this *now?*” She questioned. 

“I might not be able to later.”

*Not if that stag takes over.*

I continued, “I've been thinking that… maybe if you do what you were supposed to do and lead a soul to where it belongs, your punishment will end.”

“I’m afraid that I don't remember if I ever was a keening woman.” She muttered. 

“It couldn't hurt to try, could it?” The fever then made me add, “If I heard your song while I was dead as a doornail, I’d certainly feel like I was going to heaven, even if I wasn't.”

*I'd rather see you after I die than a Huntsman. Especially* that *Huntsman.*

She looked down at our hands, frowning in contemplation as she comfortingly traced the veins on my forearm with her finger. Her touch felt warmer than it did in the past. Maybe this was from her limited freedom, or maybe it just seemed like it because the chills were coming back. 

Comfortingly, she plucked the quilt from the back of the couch and tucked it around me. 

“I don't have your shirt,” She assured me after a moment of silence. “You're not going to die.”

I tried to look at the white stag head on. It wouldn't let me. It preferred to remain in my peripheral vision. The buzzing turned into a high-pitched, tinny whine. I'd preferred the buzzing. The whine was accompanied with a sensation of two knitting needles being driven into my ears. Or maybe it was the white stag’s antlers. 

“I don't think killing me is its goal.” I uttered. 

I was shaking again, though I wasn't sure if it was from the fever. 

There was a knock at the door. The Weeper put a hand on my shoulder to keep me from getting up, opting to answer it for me. The stag watched her curiously as she let Victor and Reyna in. 

It was hard to concentrate on what they were saying with that horrible whine in my ears. I had to ask them to repeat themselves numerous times, but I still didn't process anything they were saying. They may as well have been speaking Simlish. 

Reyna produced a jar and filled it up with tap water. She then told me to crack an egg into it. Naturally, I was confused, but I did as I was told. 

I watched the yolk spread out over the surface of the water. It swirled as it bobbed up and down, eventually forming a shape. It resembled a head with antlers. 

There was a growl. The others didn't hear it. 

The Weeper announced that she wanted to help me in any way that she could. Victor seemed surprised by this, but told her the best thing he could think of for her to do at the moment was to find another hagstone for me. She simply nodded once, then was on her way. 

My debt to her just keeps on growing, doesn't it? It's a good thing she's kind, especially compared to other Neighbors. I don't even want to think of what the mechanic could do to me if I was as indebted to him as I was to her. 

Currently, my coworkers are preparing to do an exorcism on me. I've been typing all of this on my phone while waiting. What else am I going to do? 

The white stag is waiting, too. I don't know if it’s real, but I swear that I can feel its hot breath on the back of my neck. The brightness is making it hard to breathe. It's gone from a flutter to a hand tightening its grip around my heart. Against my will, my mind conjured an image of a worm coiling around it like a snake. 

As yinz know, the reason why I started this series was to keep people outside of Orion's coverage area informed on atypical animals. I know that this information has been helpful to a few of you. Because I don't want any of yinz to lose us as a resource, I've given Reyna access to this account just in case something goes wrong. 

That, and I consider some of yinz friends and don't want to leave you in the dark about what's been happening to me. I also don't want to sugarcoat it. 

I'll admit that I'm scared. I've been in some rough situations before, but this tops all of them. That being said, I trust my coworkers. I know that no matter what, they'll get this thing out if me. I *will* be me again. They *will* fix this. 

Looks like it's go time.
