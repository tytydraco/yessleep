Hello everyone,

I am not a speculative person. The paranormal has never held a spot in my mind for more than a fleeting moment. My life is built on practicality and cemented in reality. But recently, that foundation has cracked and… I don’t know where else to turn.


No one I’ve reached out to has believed me. They think I made this up. But how could I? Why would I? This doesn’t make any sense to me, but maybe to your eyes it will.


Some months ago, a family friend of mine, who I was close to during my childhood, disappeared. Right off the face of the earth. No explanation. Granted… I wouldn’t be the one who would receive such an explanation, but still, she was a person who the rest of the world noticed was gone.


She held a job serving the local community, and everyone around town knew her by name.


Her once loud apartment—filled with the sounds of her singing or the smells of her cooking—became still and silent. The type of silence you hear after a deep snowfall. It was unnatural and seemingly unexplainable. So much so that, in only the span of a day, her neighbors were knocking feverishly at her door to check on her.


No answer.


No noise. No sign of anything even breathing within. They called the police for a welfare check, urging them that something must be wrong. Even though it had only been a day since her silence.


They forced the door open a couple hours later.


Within her apartment, they found nothing. Not a trace of her. Not even a loose strand of hair, dirty dishes, or anything that pointed to her being here recently. Just her pictures, furniture, and her clothes were there. Remnants of her existence that were the only sign of her life being lived within those walls.


No one had seen her leave since the silence fell. The cameras in the hallway of her apartment building showed her enter the day before like normal. She never left again. 


Her place was on the 15th floor. The fire escape is enclosed with cameras. She never came out from the apartment, according to the recordings. No windows were found opened. There was no body. Not even one splattered on the street below.


Roughly around 2:30 p.m. she was erased from this world. That was 4 months ago. No one has heard from her since.


Her family has moved their search out of town now, thinking she must have left or escaped some unfortunate fate. Her things in the apartment were moved to storage. The whole place was being cleaned and freshly painted to provide a home for someone new.


It seemed like just a slightly mysterious disappearance, right? But still plausible in some regards.


That all changed when the letter was pushed through. It’s branded itself on me now. I only hope someone out there knows how to help.


One night, in the dark hallway of her floor, a small letter was pushed through from under the door of the abandoned apartment.


It was addressed to me.


Her friend Jake who had been painting the place dropped it off that same day. He explained that when he found the letter, he had hoped that it was her who came back to leave it for me. Hoping for some news of her, he immediately went to the landlord and asked to see the camera feeds to see who left the letter.


His heart dropped when he saw the recording. I almost didn't believe it. Until I saw it myself.


In the grainy footage, all that was seen was the letter being pushed from underneath the closed apartment door. After seeing the tape, Jake asked the landlord if anyone else besides him had a key. The landlord assured him that no one could have gotten in there. It was impossible.


As impossible as her disappearance.


They reviewed the camera feeds for the days and weeks before, in the times when someone could have gotten in unawares, but the only people seen going in and out were her family and friends, who were all seen to leave.


The letter was in her writing, anyone that lived in this community could tell. Small, neat words were written on the outside, right in the center of the pale white envelope. This is what it said:


For Thomas,


“Something to remind me that our fears and doubts can doom us. We hold the key to the doors of memory. We can lock the haunted ones away.”


The tone was all wrong. She had never spoken like that before. I should have waited… but in my anticipation to know more of this new voice she spoke in, I quickly opened the letter.


A disclaimer: 


Because I have nowhere else to turn to, I have written what was inclosed below. However, before you read on, I need to warn you. 


Once you read her words, there is no turning back. 
It becomes real. 


You begin to pass by it. Out of your peripheral vision, it peaks. I am not sure if it will affect you as it has affected me, but I need all the answers I can get. I can’t take it anymore; someone else needs to understand. 



This is the line you should not cross. 



Letter from under the door:


You drive down a busy road cutting through an old wooded place. It is winter and the trees have lost their canopy. With that gone, they also lose their ability to shade us from the pain that they obscure. You see it now as you rush past the sleeping boughs. A place you remembered from your childhood. For a fleeting second, it's there, but you move too fast and it's gone from view. 


The image of it lingers in your thoughts. You believed that place wasn't even real—just a combination of memories that melded together into one blurry whole. An amalgamation of different experiences attaching themselves to that place. Like your subconscious was cataloging those memories within that lost building. 


You haven't thought about it in a while. It usually comes back to you through the hazy mist just before sleep overtakes you, or when you awake for no reason in the middle of the night. You can see the doors to that building, the lights flashing behind the glass. The silhouettes of long-forgotten people dancing on the window panes. 


Were they running? Did it get them? It has been long since you ran beside them, but you remember how they called your name. Their smiles flash before you. You see their faces now in your windshield. You quickly look behind you to see if they are in the car with you. They caught you now. 


The car meets an immovable object. You meet your fate. There is no movement for you now. Only the wind blowing through the trees. Emerald fingers begin to grow from branches. The fingers turn to hands. The hands hold you back forever in the memories of another. 


You look out from the windows of that forgotten place and see them pass by. You pound at the doors, calling out to them.


They do not hear you.


See you soon.


 (End of letter)



Through every window, I see the shadows standing. They watch me move, their hands on the panes. No one else sees them. They have no eyes. If you look too closely, they begin to move.


I haven’t slept in many days. My eyes hurt after I finished reading it. No one else has been able to read those words. Everyone I show the letter to just sees a jumble with no discernible meaning. They think I’ve made it up, but yet, every reflection has been infected.


I don’t know anything about the place mentioned in the letter—a place of forgotten things. Hidden behind trees. It’s too vague. It could be anywhere. But I know that the answers must lie there.


I see the thing’s fingers on my screen now as I type this. Someone else needs to know. Someone else needs to know I was here… that I existed and this thing is trying to take me. I only hope you never see it.


I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.


If anyone has heard of a place like this, please reach out. The shadows haven’t tried anything yet. They just stare. They have no eyes, but I can feel them boring into my soul. 


It’s becoming cold.


I don’t think I have much time left. 


Soon I’ll know where they took her…
