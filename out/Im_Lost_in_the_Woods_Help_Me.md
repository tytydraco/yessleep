I don't know what to do. It's cold in these woods. I don't know how I am going to get this out. Surprised I even got into this phone. I found it in a random bag out here. 

The notes apps is for sure something. Can see me lose my mind in real time! I might try to send this out on Twitter or maybe a Instagram post but nobody really pays attention to those things at all. I'm going to try to retell how I got here but my memory is a little foggy. I had quite the fall and I can't really remember much. 

I know I was on the road for some reasonâ€¦
I'm not sure but I know I lost control and flew out. Lucky enough there was some tall grass right there that helped slow me down ever so slightly. I have some rashes and cuts and a chuck of my ear is gone but I lived. Most can't even say that. 

I think I might have a concussion because I woke up at sundown and I can't remember my way out. I know the mountains are west. If you live in Colorado Springs (or that general area) you know that Pikes Peak always faces west. Away is east; little bit up is north, And a little bit down is south. I'm not a dude who would keep myself in those stupid situations in the horror stories I read online but this feels like a horror story for sure. 

I think I found a trail that leads to a main road but I'm not sure. It goes down quite a ways, and cars are always going up and down this little dirt road. It's real dangerous to be up here. It's 30 minutes away from the nearest police station.

I'm really just hope this sends out. I've tried Twitter. I've tried wattpad. I've tried I sta gram stories ( too long) and I've tried insta post, nothing is going through. I'm going to try reddit, I don't really use that so I don't know the rules or anything. Let me stay on topic I'm just freaking out too much honestly. Can't even type right now. I can almost hear the blood rushing from my ear, it's deafening sound is pounding in my head. 

I'm walking down the trail right now and I pray I'm going the right way back to town. I know now my car won't be an option. I'm staring at it in flames on the side of the mountain and the flames are dying out. All I have is a t-shirt and shorts. I'm going to die up here. I've thought about it plenty of times as I would ride up here. What would it feel like to be stuck up here? What kind of dredd or stress would I feel? Would it open me up more after? Well I guess we will have to wait for that third one til I get myself out of this mess I made for myself. I'm cold, bleeding and lost. I don't recognize that whistle
