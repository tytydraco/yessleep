When I was a child, I had a phobia of bears. I'd say it was a pretty rational fear, actually. After all, they *are* massive killing machines that could easily outrun you and crush your skull in their jaws. At ten years old, I had seen a movie about a killer bear, hunting a group of people lost in the woods and picking them off one by one. My parents hadn't intended for me to see it, I just happened to witness it on my friend's television when I was over at his house one evening. 

However, this fear was kept a secret by me, even when my family packed up and went on a week-long camping trip to the mountains. My twin sister and I were informed of how to stay safe as we stayed in that maze of a forest. We were to never stray too far, and never keep food in our tent, or it would attract bears. We had a can of bear mace with us, and my father was armed with a rifle he was licensed to carry. He wasn't a hunter, he was just a very cautious man whose favorite phrase was *'better safe than sorry.'*  

He explained to us that many dangers, animal and otherwise, could be lurking in the woods. After all, we were secluded. No nearby park rangers and friendly campers for miles. He never liked the thought of us being vulnerable, and I wasn't about to complain. Despite the security of all our precautions, I still had nightmares of waking up to a bear sniffing around outside my tent.

I slept in a small tent alone, and so did my sister, Esther. We were pretty trustworthy and independent kids, so they trusted us with our own tents while they slept in a bigger one together. We grew up sheltered from the harsh realities of life and the shocking horror movies that instilled nightmares into other children's heads; because of this, growing up we weren't as anxious of the dark or 'things that go bump in the night' as other kids. I hadn't needed a nightlight since I was three, but boy how things had changed since then. 

My friend, George, had laid-back parents who let him practically do whatever he wanted, and that meant watching whatever he wanted. He had pressured me into sharing his hobby of watching horror movies, which ranged from laughable failures to terrifying masterpieces. This left an impression on me. It felt like those movies had warped my mind. Every creak in my house at night was now a possible intruder, and every shadow could have a masked serial killer using it as a cover to catch me off guard. Despite this, I enjoyed those movies with him, and like a horrible addiction I couldn't shake, I just kept coming back. 

But enough of that, I would like to tell you a story that still confuses and terrifies me to this day. It started with that one family camping trip. For most of the week, it was your average vacation. We would swim in the lake nearby on a humid afternoon, we would eat sausages roasted over the fire for dinner and make s'mores for dessert. Dad told us a few cliche campfire stories and then mom would crawl into our tents and kiss us goodnight before she retired into her own.

I absolutely dreaded bedtime during camping. I dreaded when the fire would be put out, dousing us all in darkness. I dreaded when I would be the last one to fall asleep, and a lonely feeling would creep up on me. I dreaded when I had to take a leak in the middle of the night, and would crawl out of my tent with a flashlight, aiming it in all directions in a rather paranoid manner. When dawn would finally crest the mountain peaks and birds began their heavenly chorus in the treetops, a wave of relief would hit me instantly. 

One night felt the longest. That day had begun typically, with a trip to the lake in our swimwear. There was a trail circling the lake and we would hike it. Our parents were laying in the sand drinking beer from the cooler, chatting with each other idly as my sister and I decided to take the short walk on the trail. The area wasn't so densely wooded, and the lake was midsized, so they could easily spot us. Esther and I were talking as we sipped from our water bottles, joking about dad's short shorts. We stumbled across the paw prints of a bear embedded in the dirt, pointing in the direction we were walking. 

Esther kneeled down in front of the prints, smiling. "Bear paws! Mom said black bears are seen around here a lot. I think black bears are the cutest bears."  She noticed my unease. "What's wrong? Are you scared of bears, Eli?" 

"Who *isn't* scared of bears?" I self consciously replied, a bit more snappishly than I intended. "Let's go. They look new. It's probably still around." 

Esther ignored me. I was about to yell at her, when I realized she had a perplexed look on her tanned face. She pointed at the paw prints. "Those are the back paws of a bear. You can tell because of how long they are." She stated. "I read a book about all sorts of bears and you can tell the difference between the front and back paws." 

Her knowledge wasn't surprising to me. Esther was a huge fan of animals, even the dangerous, predatory ones. She wanted to be a zoologist when she grew up, and she made it known constantly. However, I wasn't interested in hearing any fun facts from her at that moment. I mean, I never was, but especially not right then.  

"So what? Let's go!" I grew more and more antsy with each second that passed. I kept looking around us at the surrounding trees, keeping my eyes peeled for any sign of a hulking beast with razor claws. 

Esther didn't let up. She still looked confused, as if she were struggling over a very complex puzzle. Her eyes, which were a murky brown like the lake's waters, followed the trail of footprints which cut off at a bush. She stood up and brushed dirt off her knees. 

"Eli," she started, her eyebrows furrowed, "there's only *back* paw prints. It's like he was standing up and walking on his two feet." The serious expression dissolved as she burst into laughter. "I just imagined it! It looks so funny! So cute!" 

I gawked at her. A bear? Cute? I simply rolled my eyes as we returned to the lake's shore, ignoring what she'd said. We promptly told our parents of our findings but they weren't particularly concerned. We stayed there for another hour. I was swimming backwards, enjoying myself, when something caught the corner of my eye. A flash of movement on the other side of the lake. 

I stood upright from my backstroke position, curious. At this point, I was relaxed, no longer worried about a bear, and I figured it could have been a wandering stag we could admire from afar. I slightly squinted my eyes, having lost sight of it among the trees' many overlapping shadows. That's when I saw a big furry arm move further behind a thick tree trunk. 

My heart sank. It was definitely a bear, no other animal had such an identical appendage. The way it's arm hung down made it obvious it was in a standing position. Now, I couldn't see it, because it had hid itself completely. 

Was it scared of us? That's normal, I heard. Often, the big scary animals we feared were scared of us as well, but that did little to quell my anxiety. I started to swim back to where my sister and parents were playing in the shallow end. I did not say anything yet, I just kept an eye on that side of the woods. 

I was almost there when a large, furry head peeked out from behind the tree. Just as quick as it had done that, it drew back. It wasn't too quick for me to notice some pretty startling details, however. Despite the distance, I could see white in its eyes, because they were so big and gaping. Wait. Bears didn't have very noticeable whites in their eyes, did they? There was something else pretty off about its face, but I didn't look long enough to figure it out. 

I explained to my family what I'd seen, and they finally agreed to leave. We got our stuff ready pretty quickly and left the lake. I can't tell you how many times I looked over my shoulder as we walked back, my hands shaky.

"Calm down, bud." My father said soothingly. "It was probably just curious. Besides, we have the mace in case it decides to bother us." 

I said nothing in response. Esther held my hand reassuringly and I didn't give any reaction to that either. I couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that crept up on me. I kept replaying the memory of its head poking out and staring at me with wide, oddly human-like eyes. Thinking back on it, I started to feel like something was also wrong with its snout, but still didn't know what specifically it was. 

The rest of that evening before bed transpired uneventfully. I was silent for the most part, convincing myself in my head that I had imagined the creepy aspects of the bear's face. Too many horror movies will do that to you, I reasoned with myself. That's the explanation my parents would give me. They were definitely not the superstitious or spiritual type, so they could provide a rational explanation for anything.  

We started preparing for bed, hanging our food up far away so the scent wouldn't attract any animals, and dousing the fire again. I made sure to take care of my business before crawling into my tent, to prevent my usual 3 AM nature calls. I settled into my covers, trying to fall asleep before everyone else. My family, as always, stayed awake in their tents for about an hour with their lanterns shining from inside. Usually, they were up reading, they were all bookworms unlike me. Despite my best efforts to fall asleep, their lamps turned off one by one before mine. 

Wide awake, I stared at the roof of my baby blue tent for a long time, observing the shadows of bugs crawling along the fabric. A candle fly had gotten in and flitted around my little electric lamp, but I refused to switch it off. It was way too bright and hurt my eyes, but I didn't care. I listened closely to the nighttime cacophony of insects, straining to hear any abnormalities. One moment, I was awake, and the next, I was watching the darkness behind my eyelids.  

A dream interrupted the peaceful emptiness of my mind. I preferred it hadn't. It was disturbing and confusing. Vivid and surreal. I was in the forest alone, no campsite, no gear, and no companions. Helpless. Vulnerable. I stood like a statue among the maze of trees until I saw that dreadful bear peek from around a tree. In the dream, it was a lot closer. Only a few feet away. 

I could see the details of its strange face. Its face was skinny and elongated, almost like a dog instead, and its mouth was crooked, as if deformed, and drooled all over its matted black fur. The deformity of its snout was bizarre, it was uneven and bent awkwardly to the left. Its eyes were very human, just like I suspected. Wide, with brown irises and large pupils. The head itself seemed too big in comparison to its snout. It was as if a small child had drew a bear from memory, without any reference especially, and it suddenly came to life. 

An icy chill of fear rippled down my spine. I felt cold and mortified by this discovery. I felt as if I couldn't move an inch, or it would lunge for me. The bear leaned further out from behind the tree, grasping the trunk with its spindly fingers. Its fingers reminded me of a raccoon's, too human for comfort, but still tipped with long jagged claws. It tapped its claws rhythmically against the bark. Its mouth hung open, as if its jaw were dislocated. Saliva dripped onto the forest floor and all was completely silent. 

Its eyes. God, its eyes. Why were they so soulless? They stared so unblinkingly. No emotion. Never leaving my gaze. What could it be thinking? 

I prayed that it wouldn't get worse. I tried to open my mouth to speak, to beg for mercy, but I couldn't pry my lips apart. The bear spoke instead, startling me so deeply that I wanted to cry out in terror. Its voice was deep, cold, and sounded like a very hateful, malicious, and old entity.  Something that had been rotting and festering with rage. 
     
***"I won't starve."***

My guess is as good as yours. Did it intend to eat me? I woke up pretty quickly afterward. I was disappointed to find that it was still quite dark outside, with no hint of a sunrise in sight. Still, I had to pee. Again. I sat there in the dark and held it for the longest time, listening to the crickets chirp and my shaky breaths. I realized that the lamp was off and pressed the switch to turn it on. A pit grew in my stomach as I realized it wouldn't turn on. The batteries had drained. 

I hastily fumbled for my flashlight, craving a source of illumination as the darkness smothered me. I couldn't even hear the sound of my dad snoring, which strangely made me feel safe. The flashlight would not work either, although I had changed its batteries recently. Confused and angry, I muttered curses too foul for my ten year old mouth. 

*"Stupid fucking thing."*

That's when I heard footsteps outside. I stiffened and listened closely. Grass and twigs crunched under someone's feet as they tread through the campsite. One of my family members, for certain. Most likely Esther. I felt relief flow through me, knowing someone was awake decreased that dreadful lonely feeling; a feeling that I was alone in my terror. Some comforting words from my sister would be much appreciated. 

I peeled the cover from my lap as warm orange firelight began to glow. I started to reconsider the late night walker being my dad instead. When the sun was close to rising, he would light a fire and relax before everyone woke up. I knew this because I was up early one day and could experience the beautiful sight of dawn with him. This excited me more than the prospect of it being my sister.  
  
On all fours, I leaned towards my tent flaps and unzipped them. The zipper got stuck halfway. I struggled with it for a second, until my eyes glanced at the campfire my tent was facing. I stopped messing with the zipper and stared. 

Oh...Oh *God.*

That wasn't my dad. Or my sister. It wasn't anyone I knew, nor was it human. 

A lump grew in my throat as I watched the furry figure of a bear sit on a log by the fire, facing my direction. The fire was small, and just barely lit its crooked, unhinged snout and large unseeing eyes. I couldn't even tell if it was looking directly at me, but I didn't want to look anymore. I started crying quietly as I zipped my tent back up, literally pissing myself. Choked with a primal fear, I hid under my cover. 

An unnatural, heavy feeling settled over my chest. It felt like something was sitting on me, pushing against my ribcage, weighing me down. My head started to spin. I felt so dizzy, and I tried to move. It felt like an extra 500 pounds had been added to each of my limbs. I could barely lift my hand three inches off the ground. My eyelids fluttered half-closed. At the time, my child brain figured this is what it felt like to be drunk, having seen my father return from the bar and collapse in the living room, unable to stand on his own.  

I managed to move my arm enough to rustle the cover off of my eyes, so I could at least see in my tent. I realized that the night had gone eerily silent. There were no more crickets or cicadas singing, no more owls hooting, nothing. Only the sound of the fire crackling, and the deep, growling and grunting of an aggressive bear. This bear sounded very real, and normal, not an anthropomorphic bear with a baritone voice. Footsteps neared my tent and circled it. 

I wanted to scream, and to cry, hopefully waking up my parents who would save me from this nightmare. However, nothing but a pitiful fusion of a squeak and a whimper escaped my trembling lips. It felt like my throat was being constricted. I couldn't move a muscle or utter one syllable. All I could do was move my eyes. A large snout poked and prodded at the tent, sniffing. The bear outside roared, piercing the silence. I had always thought a bear's roar sounded miserable and desperate, unlike the mighty roar of a lion. It did. Not only that, but it sounded angry, and ravenous.

My eyes followed the faint silhouette of the bear walking, on all fours, at the rear of my tent. I hoped to God it would just go away. I figured he might have heard me, because the bear's head looked at me for a second, right before it walked off, into the darkness. The heavy feeling pinning my body down was starting to lighten up. I opened my mouth to scream. 

A voice interrupted me. A snarling voice sounding as old as time and as nasty as sin itself. 

***"I will not starve."***  

My head snapped towards my tent flaps. The terrifying mockery of a bear had its deformed head sticking into my tent. Its gaping, twisted maw and round, glassy eyes were closer than ever before. Even worse, his long fingers, tipped with even longer claws, reached towards me. 

I released a scream so deafening that I'm sure any woodland critter within a five mile radius would've been frightened away had they heard it.  The bear gripped me by the hair and dragged me out of the tent, so fast I barely processed it. I flailed around in the dirt and grass, screaming for my family to help me. 

"Mom! Dad! Esther!" I wailed in terror, helplessly reaching for their tents. The bear growled lowly as it continued to drag me through the campsite, absolutely no one coming to my aid. Surely they couldn't have still been asleep?! 

***"Don't starve me."*** The bear wheezed, its voice warbling and growing higher in pitch, as if it were whining. Globs of its spit landed on my pale, tear-streaked face. 

It let go of me not too far away from the tents, dropping me at its normal-looking back paws. I tried scrambling away, but it immediately pounced down and began to devour me. Gripping my frail arm in between its long fingers, it bit down as hard as it could with an unhinged lower jaw. The monster ripped my entire arm off. Flesh and bone gave way to its teeth. The pain nearly blinded me. My mind had gone full prey at that moment. All I could do was scream and desperately try to crawl away with my one arm. I didn't dare fight back, not at first. 

The bear's paw balled up my shirt in the back and flipped me over so I was stomach-up and looking at his weird face. My eyes bulged as I gaped at him, vision blurry from a fountain full of tears. The black bear panted heavily, from excitement or effort I did not know, but with each pant expelled in a puff of hot air, its lower jaw flapped loosely. 

Without thinking, I grabbed its lower jaw and began to pull with all my strength, fueled by adrenaline and a sudden surge of courage. I figured that was his weak spot, and I was correct. In fact, it was too easy to pull half of his jaw off his face. The meat gave way with a fleshy squelching and cracking sound, as if it were already weak and decayed. The bear howled in pain much like a man would, and frantically pawed at its face. I stood up and ran to my parents' tent. I felt disoriented and fell against the front of it before I attempted to unzip it. 

To my relief, they were already opening it from inside. I could also hear Esther clambering out of her hot pink tent behind me. All three of their faces were white, as if bloodless. They looked almost as spooked as I did. My mom screamed bloody murder as she saw the bloody stump that was my shoulder. I fell into her arms, feeling weak and sleepy. Esther's screams collided with mom's and made a very chilling chorus of horror. My dad was sprinting in action, tossing my mom a first aid kit and going to the car to start it. 

As my sister and mother peered over me, I weakly turned my head to see the bear. It was gone. Nowhere to be found. Not even its broken off jaw. 

"Baby! Oh god, my poor baby, what happened!" My mom cried, smoothing my hair away from my face. 

"Bear." I sobbed, my voice cracking as waves of pain rolled through my body, wrecking my nerves. I couldn't even say anything else, I just cried as the agony continued its assault on my little body. 

In the car, we drove miles and miles to where we could get help, as my mom tended to me to the best of her abilities with the first aid kit. I was in and out of consciousness, listening to their conversation. There was no mention of the bear's strange appearance. In fact, it sounded like they hadn't even seen the bear. Later, my sister would tell me that she heard the bear attacking me, but it felt as if there was a weight pinning her body down to the ground. She couldn't get out the tent and found it so strange that she wondered if she was having sleep paralysis and imagining the attack. I think the same thing happened to mom and dad, although they didn't speak about it in front of me.

My family thought that a normal bear had come into my tent and dragged me out, but was scared away by the sounds of them getting out of the tent. I tried to tell them what I had seen and heard, but they didn't believe me of course. They thought I was simply experiencing the effects of trauma, and painting it to be much scarier than it already was. 

I still don't know what that thing was. A bear which spoke without moving its mouth, walked like a man everywhere it went, and caused such a strange effect on people and things; like silencing the environment, and rendering my family helpless to stop it. I also wondered about the very real bear that distracted me from the creature sneaking up on me. Was that real or an illusion? They could not find the bear that supposedly attacked me, in order to kill it. It took me a while to adapt to life with one arm missing (the ripped off arm had disappeared with rhe bear) and a severe case of PTSD. 
 
Now, I am in college and I have never stepped foot in another forest again. My dormmates want to go on a camping trip during spring break, and I let them know that if they did, I would not be attending. We all eventually settled on a stay at a beach house. I prefer that a lot more, wouldn't you?
