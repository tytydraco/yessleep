This is a story of a day alone. Not unlike any other. Learning something new is always fun and for Nick, today would be a whirlwind of new. The President is Dead. False actors are at play. Coverups are everywhere. Our team of crackerjack reporters are on the scene. Feeding the news you are meant to hear. Nick is on to something different. A story unlike the others. Was he the whistleblower all along? Who shot the president? Where is this story going? re is this story going?   
  
Nick turned off the TV and grabbed his laptop. He had been following the news of the president’s assassination for the past week, but he knew there was more to it than what the media was telling. He had a source inside the White House, a former colleague who had contacted him anonymously and sent him a file with some shocking information. Nick opened the file and scanned through the documents. They contained evidence of a conspiracy involving the vice president, the secretary of defense, and a shadowy organization known as the Syndicate. They had planned to kill the president and take over the country, using a fake terrorist attack as a cover. Nick felt a surge of adrenaline as he realized he had the biggest scoop of his career. He had to expose the truth and stop the coup. He quickly typed up an email to his editor, attaching the file and explaining the situation. He hit send and waited for a reply. He hoped his editor would believe him and publish his story. He knew he was taking a huge risk, but he also knew he had no choice. He had to do his duty as a journalist and as a citizen. He looked at his watch and saw it was almost noon. He decided to go out and get some lunch. He grabbed his coat and headed for the door. He didn’t notice the black van parked across the street, or the two men inside watching him through binoculars.   
  
Nick wakes up. It was a dream. Right? Dreams have smells and like vibrant colors, sounds are still ringing. Everything seems fine. Nothing is out of place as Nick filters though his ottaman, retrieving several bottles of medication. Opening, taking and drinking from his soda, the drepression is ongoing. The ringing in the ears continues to a cell phone call. Its a notification call of his next psychatric appointment.   
  
Nick shook his head and tried to clear his mind. He looked at the phone and saw the reminder of his appointment. He sighed and got up from the couch. He had been seeing a therapist for the past few months, ever since he quit his job as a reporter. He had been working on a big story about the president’s corruption, but he had been betrayed by his source and framed for a crime he didn’t commit. He had spent a week in jail before he was released on bail. He had lost his reputation, his career, and his friends. He had fallen into a deep depression and started having nightmares about the president’s death. He wondered if it was all a coincidence or if there was something more sinister behind it. He decided to go to his appointment and talk to his therapist about his dream. Maybe he could find some answers or at least some peace of mind. He grabbed his keys and wallet and left his apartment. He didn’t notice the black van following him from a distance, or the two men inside talking on their earpieces.   
  
These days are a struggle as depression hurts. Nick finds his way to a Private eye. The most covert way possible. No need having his target knowing his plans. Shaking hands the girl agrees to find his secret admirer. See, Nick has been noticing weird coincidences and flashes throughout his waking dreams, inicstricably intertwined with the real world. His story infiltrated his world and the private eye was on the case. Nick was done for the day. Deciding to go for a swim at the local YMCA.   
  
Nick arrived at the YMCA and changed into his swimsuit. He needed to relax and forget about his troubles for a while. He loved swimming and felt free in the water. He walked to the pool and dove in. He swam a few laps and felt his muscles loosen up. He smiled and enjoyed the sensation of the water on his skin. He didn’t notice the shadowy figure on the balcony above him, holding a sniper rifle. He didn’t hear the shot that pierced his skull and ended his life. He didn’t see the blood that stained the water red. He didn’t know that his secret admirer was actually his former source, who had been hired by the Syndicate to kill him. He didn’t know that his dream was actually a premonition of his own death. He didn’t know that his story was true and that he had died for nothing. He didn’t know that he was the last hope for the country and that the Syndicate had won.   
  
Red ink drips down the page. A pen emerges to sign the author's name. Page is pulled from the stack and peered at. Is the end really here. Where do I go to? I want this to stop, the story is never over. I must write the story invented by you. I am only the scribe.
