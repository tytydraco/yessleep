I didn’t really know where to talk about this, but a friend suggested this subreddit.



Have you ever gotten the feeling like your being watched? Well, this was the opposite. I was coming out of the endocrinologist, waiting at the elevators. It was a crisp fall day, golden sunlight spilling in from outside.



I left the office, checked out in the waiting room, and after a quick stop at the restrooms, made for the elevators. All the while the dull beat of the bulding heart acomanidy me. Distant clater from machings, voices down the hall, the hum of the electic lights. I hit “down” and began to wait.



That’s when I noticed it. It had gone quiet. I looked around. The lights were still on, and I could hear myself, breathing, my jacket rustling. But the distant sound of people and medical equipment was gone. Then I got an eerie feeling. Like... like no one could see me, or hear me. Like I would never be heard from again. I pressed the button a second time. But nothing happened. I was starting to feel VERY creeped out by this point, but, I told my self “there’s no reason to panic.” I stepped around the corner, looking for signs of life.



I gasped softly. On the hall floor leading back to endocrinology were hundreds of needles. Thousands. Hypodermic needles, finger sticks, I even saw a few for sowing. None of them were encased, and even with my thick boots I wasn't going to try walking down the hall and risk stepping on them. I glanced around again, but still there was not one. I tried the other hallways, but they were all the same. Then my phone buzzed. I checked the notification. High blood sugar. “Crud.” My phone buzzed again, and the number ticked up.



Now, you may not know how these blood sugar apps work; they basically update every 8 minutes, so the number ticking up like a timer shouldn't have been possible. Whats more, I knew the number had to be wrong. If my sugar had been that high, I would've been throwing up, but I felt fine. I looked up from my phone as a sharp, metal smell hit my nose.



Blood. There was blood everywhere. It was seeping out from under hall doors, dripping down from ceiling tiles, even coming out of the vending machine. Then I did throw up.



I looked down the hall, and saw it darkening at the corners. The blood was swirling, as if caught up in an unseen current. Despite how much of it there was , it hadn't come into the elevator waiting room. But it was coming closer. It began to surge forward like a sled dog whipped by cruel hands. It started to boil and froth, and where it touched burned like acid.



I could see something coming now, from the end of the hall, and I knew if it got me that no one would ever know, no one could see us. Then the elevator dinged. The doors slid open, and the thing hesitated.



I didn’t wait to see what would happen next. I bolted for the doors and punched “L” as fast as I could. The doors slid closed, and whatever it was moved farther back into the darkness at the end of the hall. When I reached the lobby I bolted out of there like a shot and practically jumped into my car. I burned rubber out of the parking lot and called home.



When I left the office, it had been close to 5pm. Now it was nearly midnight. I had been in that strange not-a-place for over 5 hours, though it felt like 15 minutes. My family didn’t seem to think it strange I had basically disappeared off the face of the earth for a quarter of a day without telling anyone.



They seemed only mildly confused when I pointed it out. I think whatever that place was, no one would have missed me if I had stayed. Or been taken. I don’t go to that office anymore.
