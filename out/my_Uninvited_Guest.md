I very recently moved into a new apartment. About a week after moving in, late at night I heard a knock at the door. I opened the door and saw nothing except a light cold breeze. I thought nothing of it and sat back down on the couch. A short while after I went to bed. I lie down in the bed and I could have sworn I saw something standing in the corner of my room. I again thought nothing of it because I often scare myself thinking I saw something out of the corner of my eye. The next morning I woke up and rolled over to see very clearly a figure standing in the corner of my room in a black top hat and a light brown trench coat. I sat up and stared at it for a minute. I walked out of my room and tried to take my mind off it, assuming I just didn’t get enough sleep. I grabbed a banana and went to work but I couldn’t for the life of me forget his figure. It didn’t look like a hallucination. Its figure was so clear. I assured myself it was nothing and after all, my dog clearly didn’t see anything.

I went about my day thinking nothing of it. I got home a little later because I was hanging out at a friend’s house. I walked in the door straight to my room. I turned on the light and jumped back. It was still standing there. I just walked to my living room. I didn’t know what to think. I walked into my room again to get a blanket. I watched the thing very intently as if it could jump out at me any moment. Thankfully it didn’t. I fell asleep a couple of hours later on my couch. I definitely couldn’t sleep in my room until it leaves.

I very vaguely remember the dream I had that night. I was in my childhood room. Various toys on the floor. My little brother’s crib in the left corner and the thing that is in my room. It was facing me. No facial features. Although for some reason, I wasn’t scared. It had a comforting presence. It made me not scared of it.

When I woke up I felt the urge to talk to that thing. It was five in the morning, roughly. I walked into my room turning on all the lights on my way, disturbing my dog. I walked in my room, my room for some reason not scared or at least not as scared as I was the previous night. It was standing there, same position as last night. I stepped towards him. I wanted him to react. I just wanted to know if this thing was even real. I almost got within arm’s reach of him. I got a crippling headache. It hurt more than anything I had ever experienced. I only barely felt myself fall to the floor. I blacked out. I must have been out for a while. The sun was in my eyes. My dog was curled up next to me. I lied there confused, still with a pounding headache. I stood up and sat on my bed staring at him still unmoving.

I stared at it. I said “What even are you?” Not expecting a response but it felt good to actually talk to it. I looked at it but actually looked at it this time with no fear. This time he was tall. He had to be at least 7ft tall. He towered over me (I’m 6’2). “Damn, you’re tall,” I say compulsively. I tried to take a picture of it. It didn’t show up on camera.

I decided to go to a church and talk to a priest. I’m not a religious man but this has to be a demon of some sort. But I’ll report back.
