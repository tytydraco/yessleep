 

For some this story might sound FAKE but i am sure what I saw.

I'm a car mechanic from Toledo, Ohio i was visiting family in Lakewood Colorado when i drove trough a forest at around 2:15 AM. I left my home late so i knew i would need to drive trough the night but i didn't expect do need to drive a 2 hour detour because of road works. What the hell kinda road works need a 2 hour detour, i didn't think much of it anyways. I should have arrived at my parents house at around 9 AM but i didn't make it and this is why.

It was 1:56 AM when i drove past a sign that read: "beware animals might cross road unexpected" by that I knew i would be driving trough a forest or a field. About 10 minutes later I arrived at the entrance of the forest and once again there was the same sign that said: "beware animals might cross road unexpected" so i made sure to turn on my fog lights so i would see if an animal crossed the road.

I drove half an hour trough the forest and it was still going i thought in myself: 'damn this is a big forest when is it going to end' then suddenly my headlights went out so i pulled over and got out of my car. since i'm a mechanic i thought i could fix it myself, I opened the hood of my car and saw that the cable was disconnected, it must have happened when i hit a bump the cable was probably loose. I connected the cable again but the lights didn't turn back on, oh yeah the engine isn't on so i turned the key but nothing happened it didn't even make a starting noise. Dammit i guess i'l call my parents and tell them i will be late and then call a cab.

I had 0 cell service so there was no calling and i didn't know how long to walk until there was an end to this forest and i am not walking in the night, I guess i'l sleep in the car until morning and then walk to the nearest gas station. I was about to get into my car when I heard a howl close by, crap i don't have time for this. I ran towards my trunk where i had an AR 15 stored (don't ask me why I had an AR 15 in my trunk i had my reasons) it was dark so i couldn't see 5 feet in front of me so i duck taped my flashlight to the barrel of my gun so i could see where the wolves were, then i saw it we stared in each others eyes when it ran towards me and i fired 5 times every shot landed in its head and i fell down in front of my feet. i nudged it with my muzzle to see if it was still moving but it wasn't so i was ready to get back into my car when i heard a moose and that's weird because there aren't moose's in Missouri, I didn't know if it was aggressive or not and i wasn't risking it so i got into my car and kept my eyes wide open.

Then i saw it but it wasn't a moose it was something else it was like a shadow a human silhouette, so i got out of my car and aimed my rifle and turned on my flashlight but I still couldn't see what it was i told it to come closer so I could see it better but it had no face no anything it was like a shadow then it ran towards me so i shot it 3 times but it kept running the bullets went trough the shadow and into the tree behind it so i started running into the forest, I'm a pretty fast runner so i thought I lost it.

After 5 minutes of walking i found a deserted camping i was used to camping out in deserted buildings because of my time in the marines that's why i shot the wolf so accurate if you were wondering I sat their on a chair what felt for hours but it was probably just minutes that is when I heard that moose again there was noway i was falling for that again so i flipped a table took cover behind it and aimed my rifle at the door.

Waiting about 10 minutes and i heard a stick break so I knew it was the mysterious entity it opened the door and I dumped my mag in it but it didn't even get hit, once again all the bullets went right trough him. It ran towards me and I closed my eyes i knew it was over. Let me tell you one thing, in the movies and stories before you die your life flashes before your eyes but it doesn't. I was surprised when i woke in my with my rifle next to me, maybe it was a dream i checked my mag but all the bullets were missing so i did shoot them all, it was only then when i realized that i wasn't in a forest but it was in the same spot I left it in even my hood was still open and the wolf was like before laying next to my car. Weird

My car did eventually start again and i called my parents saying i couldn't make it, I drove home and decided to tell my story.

THE END.

This is my first story so i would appreciate constructive criticism
