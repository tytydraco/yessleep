What’s the difference between a funeral home and a hospital?

It sounds like the start of a dark joke. In a sense, it was, but nobody was laughing.

Mom was already gone toward the end; lost to a swirling sea of incoherence and unconsciousness. She died before her heart stopped beating, but the worst part about humans is that we hold out hope.

You’re told that things are only going to get worse. That your loved one won’t be getting any better in their current state, and that all you can do is wait. You should know when their speech finally slips to silence, and their eyes slide shut for over a day that they aren’t waking back up.

But then that hope kicks in.

You sit on the hospital bench knowing all of that, but then your brain starts to think about everything you didn’t do yet. All the little words you forgot to tell them. All the things you never apologized for that you’re certain they held on to in the bitterness of their heart.

You go into denial because you *need* that person to wake up again. You need to hear them one last time, or feel them squeeze your hand one last time, or even just turn their head and look at you with real, honest lucidity—just to know that they’re not yet gone.

So you do that. You sit on that bench beside their bed, and watch them every waking moment. Suddenly every small stir in their bed is them about to wake up. Any tiny noise they make is a sign that they’re still lucid in there somewhere behind their lidded eyes. Every moment that they’re totally still, you stare at their sleeping face and think that any second now, their eyes will open, they’ll turn to you with a smile, they’ll greet you with kind words, and finally the terrible nightmare will be over.

They never do though. You could wait for all of time, but the fact of the matter is, my mother died days before her heartbeat stopped, and that was a hard pill to swallow.

So that brings us back to the question at hand. What’s the difference between a funeral home and a hospital? The truth is, when you a have a loved one dying among the sterile rooms, there isn’t much of a difference between the stench of lemon chemicals and formaldehyde.

After two days on that bench, I came to terms with that truth about my mom. Choked it down like curdled, rotten milk slipping down my constricted throat. At that point, the hospital *was* the funeral home. From then forward, we were just waiting for legal word that we could put what remained of her in a box and go back home to our now empty house.

I wasn’t alone there. Dad sat next to me the whole time, hand over mine. The only connection I had. With mom gone, the world felt foreign. We’d stepped through a portal into another dimension—one we didn’t belong in—and suddenly nothing made sense anymore. Food tasted different. The air was harder to breathe. Even my own skin felt wrong as it stretched over my stationary bones.

I thought the funeral home would help bring some finality to things, but it didn’t. It was the same as the hospital. Dad and I found a couch to sit on for the entire day, and just lost ourselves to the numbness, hand in hand. The world moved around us; nurses came to give us updates, and funeral directors came to ask the plans for her ceremony. A doctor came in to tell us they were shutting down the machines, and a man in a nice black suit came to let us know the sanctuary was ready to open its doors. Time was split in two, but the lines ran linear, blurring into one if you squinted enough.

And then there were the people.

Much like the funeral, the hospital had visitors too. Old friends and family. People who got word of my mom and came to try to squeeze in one last visit before it was too late. Some of them I knew, some hardly. It was nice to feel the comfort of close loved ones who stopped by, but like I said, we were no longer in their world. They felt familiar, but still seemed like strangers now, a strong link in our chain no longer there to keep us tethered.

The latter ones were the ones that made me the angriest, though. All the time in the world over the years, they could have come to visit her, but they never did. But then she was dying, and ‘Oh shit! *Now* we’ll go see the woman who loved us dearly that we never made time for! Right when she doesn’t even have the strength to know that we’re here!’.

It was pitiful. You could see the guilt on their faces when they’d greet us. The pain in their eyes as they’d look at mom and try to formulate the words to tell her deaf ears. It was those words that made me the most mad. Everyone grieves in different ways, and everyone has a right to grieve, but if your sorry asses are only here for a passing grade in empathy, then I don’t want to be around to hear them.

“I missed you so much…”

“You were such a light in my life…”

“The world won’t seem right without you.”

Oh you missed her? You never called, so I’m confused. How could she be a light in your life when you never showed your face a single time she reached out to you? The world won’t seem right without her? To you, some shmuck who probably didn’t even know her birthday? How do you think *I* feel?

Then, after all the fawning before her bedside, or to her urn at the funeral, they’d have the audacity to turn to Dad and I to address us. Isn’t it funny how in a time of death, you would think it’s a time to comfort the people closest to the deceased? But instead, it seems the opposite happens. The closest have to comfort everyone else. All the teary eyes who come up to speak to you that will be sad for a maybe a month at most, and you’re expected to tell them ‘thanks for coming’ and ‘your support means a lot’. Hug them and pat them on the back so that they’ll feel validated in their sadness over the woman that was only a small fraction of their life.

I hated it. I was already mentally drained. I was hurt, barely limping along, and yet I was forced to pull myself up and put on a face for everyone else’s sake. Sad, but not *too* sad, lest I bum people out. It would be rude for people to show and for me to not acknowledge their presence, even though I could barely acknowledge my own. I was lost in my own head, adrift in an abyss that came with looking at my dying mother’s sleeping face, or my own reflection on her golden urn.

Thank God I had Dad’s hand in mine, otherwise, I think I would have floated completely into that abyss and never found my way back. He carried me through those days, taking all the conversations for me so that I only had a hear a few words. I don’t know how he managed to be so bright in the darkness, but maybe my hand was keeping him from drifting away too.

“I’m so sorry, dear…”

“You’re being so strong through all of this…”

“She was a great woman. You were so lucky to have her.”

You know what happens when you pick at a wound as it’s trying to heal? When you keep plucking the scab off before it’s fully hardened? It scars. It doesn’t heal right. The wound stays etched into your skin forever.

That’s what it felt like those days at the hospital and funeral home. My mother was gone, and that was that. I just needed to feel it. I just needed time to process and be alone. Society doesn’t let you do that though. Once one of the most soul-crushing things that could happen to you happens, you’re expected to go through some of the most overstimulating processes and financial juggling acts just to appease people in a way that ultimately doesn’t matter.

The wound never scabbed over. People just picked and dug at it until I couldn’t take that raw, itching pain any longer. They tore at it until I became bitter and jaded.

There’s a reason why I wanted to know how it would feel to die alone, and why I drove out into the middle of nowhere to achieve that.

Those last days in the hospital, and those meager few that followed involving the funeral home were all just one blurry line, and though one is a place of crawling and screaming for dear life, and the other is a silent, haunting farewell, they both were the same serpent inching up my body to swallow me whole.

Just like the beast on the other side of the blast doors.

“What… what the heck was that?” Hope muttered, still staring at the metal slabs where a loud banging was emanating. The buzzing of the wires that kept the room safe would shock it away every few attempts, it seemed, but the creature knew we were in here now, and whatever pain the force field was causing it, it wasn’t enough to deter.

“Why do you even need to ask that at this point?” Ann scoffed darkly, “A demon? A nightmare made manifest? No clue, Hope. Same as every other-fucking-thing here.” She turned and began to charge deeper into the space, casually tossing in as she went, “It’ll kill us all the same.”

Hope shrunk away and looked to me with worry, June doing the same. We were trapped now, and there was no telling how long this beast would wait for the foxes to come out of the den. All we could do was wait some more, a prospect that only became more panic-inducing each time we had to do it.

It couldn’t be long now. The beast from below had to be returning any day now.

Maybe even hour.

Somehow, I wasn’t focused on that right now, though. My attention was on Ann as she moved over to the control panels and computers, pouring over the information on the screens with her back turned to us. The common threat hadn’t managed to stitch us back together like it usually had. The fight we’d had moments ago was raw, and it was going to be for a while.

Ann’s words still echoed in my ears: *“We’re here because of YOU.”*

The sentence brewed a bitter elixir in my head that was one part pain, one part guilt, and all parts anger. Anger at Ann for being such a bitch. Anger at myself for knowing she was right. Anger at everything for aligning the stars perfectly so that all my mess-ups and tragedies would put me stranded on this damn shelf.

June snapped me out of my head with her usual nervous stutter, “S-So what do we do? We really just have to wait? The barrier doesn’t seem to be hurting it that much; what if it breaks through?”

“The wires may not be stopping it, but that doesn’t mean it can break through a foot of steel. I think we’ll be safe.” I told her.

“The last monster could go through walls,” She reminded me.

“Well, so far this one can’t, so let’s not worry about it.” I told her, trying to also convince myself. My eyes traced back to Ann again as I began sorting various plans in my head. I didn’t have faith that the creature would be leaving anytime soon if I was right about the rigs and their manifestations. If the creature was a reflection of part of her, it would be just as stubborn.

This would be extra bad considering what my clone said as her eyes drew up and looked toward the core of the room, “Shit…”

Instantly, all petty squabbles were pushed aside in favor of progress, “What? What is it?” I asked.

“We aren’t going to have long to wait this thing out, by the looks of it.” Ann grunted, stepping down the stairs toward the core. When the three of us made it to the balcony to look down, we saw what she meant.

There was a lot of blood pouring from the core; far more than usual. Either Shae had gotten sloppy when he jacked his colleague up to the torture device, or this person in particular had been here a lot longer than the others. Their body was twitching ever so slightly in the hole, something that the others hadn’t done before we unplugged them, and I could hear a faint, rattled breathing. Looking down at the screen Ann had just been at, there was a warning that we’d seen for this rig back at the tower, although here it was much more bold and panicked.

*Cell ready for harvest; Critical malfunction detected.*

*Cell unstable; replace immediately*

*Meltdown Imminent. Evacuate Facility and contact damage control.*

I swallowed hard, then wondered aloud, “How long do you think this message has already been on screen?”

Hope bit her cheek, “Probably too long already.”

Given the collaged together blur of the hospital we’d just walked through, I was prompted to believe she was right.

“Should we shut it down? Would that fix it?” June asked.

I looked back at the door, “If we do, it might shut the door’s field down like back at the house.”

“B-But you just said the door was safe even without the barrier.”

My dread began to writhe over into a heavy frustration, “Yeah, well, how am I supposed to know for sure, June?”

My fourth clone recoiled away to turn back to the barrier, more panicked now, and I heard Ann let out a faint amused snicker from below. I snapped my head toward her to see her staring up at me before shaking her head and turning away. Even though I’d just resolved in all the chaos to be the bigger woman and let her stinging words go, the gesture raised my rage into the ceiling. What was she smirking about? She’d almost just gotten us killed with the wasted time of her outburst, and she had the audacity to start being more of a snide bitch?

I was nearly ready to unleash all my thoughts on what she’d said before, but thankfully, Hope spoke first and kept us on the rails, reaching a hand out to simmer me down, “Okay, well, last time we ended everything. Is there any way we can just shut down the core itself?”

I let out a deep, angry breath that I’d been holding and let it go cold in the space before me. Turning back to the computer, I did my best to retrace the same steps from last time. I found the screen that listed all the processes of the rigs, but this time, I did a more in-depth dive into the system. Like last time, it was pretty difficult to parse what anything meant given Kingfisher’s unique choice of terms and styling, not to mention the god-awful interface that their computers ran on. Eventually though, I did come across what I was looking for, a specific diagnostic page for the core itself.

Whatever was happening to it looked almost as gruesome as the ‘cell’ it was running on. The poor scientist stuffed in the machine was doing very little to power it according to the bar on the bottom of the page, and the numbers listed on any given status were dangerously low. Everything was flashing red, and warnings plastered the screen at nearly every inch, but luckily, there was what we were looking for at the bottom of the screen. A button to shut down the machine.

I scrolled to it and clicked, seeing what the window would prompt me with, and it quickly dashed any hope of this option.

*Are you sure you would like to cease cell functions?*

*Warning: Detected core is severely damaged and cannot properly disengage. Doing so without proper repair may result in a catastrophic failure. Are you certain you would like to proceed?*

I buried my knuckles into the side of the counter and pressed hard, trying to vent my frustration in huffs of air through my nostrils.

“What is it?” June asked.

“How do you all feel about trying to work around a ‘catastrophic failure’?” I said out loud.

A chorus of nervous breaths filled either ear. June shrunk into herself then leaned against the counter for support, and Hope nervously pivoted back to the door, biting her cheek in thought. I just kept my eyes glued to the screen, stewing on too many emotions at once to even think.

A sharp metallic bang from within the room made us all jump. The banging was supposed to be *outside* the door right now. We whipped toward its source below to see Ann in the pit near the original metal cylinder, a mini crowbar in her hands that we got from the hardware store. We’d all turned just in time to see her rolling it up against the wall, then pinning it with her boot to jam the tool onto a crevasse of its surface.

Concern hovered in Hope’s words as she asked, “Ann, what are you doing?”

My clone didn’t respond. She just situated the crowbar firmly in the crack and began to tug. The laser cut metal was too finely carved for her to get a good bite, however, and it quickly snapped out, making her stagger back and let out a couple curse words.

“Ann,” I said sharply, no longer having patience.

She didn’t look our way. Only tossed her shoulders and returned to the cell, starting a new attempt, “Well, it looks like the only option we have right now is our usual. Just sit on our asses and wait. May as well try and solve more mystery about this place, right?”

“You’re trying to pry it open?” asked Hope.

Ann didn’t respond again. Just botched another attempt and filled the room with another metallic clang, complimenting the ones still coming from the door.

“Do… you think we could plug that one back in?” June offered, “Maybe there’s still enough juice for it to hold open while we get out.”

“I wouldn’t count on it,” Ann curtly tossed, sticking the teeth of metal back into the crack. She continued through strained, gritted teeth as she applied pressure once more, “There’s a gauge on it, but it’s not moving. Thing’s dead.”

This time, as she pulled, the shell made some mild popping and cracking noises, but it still wasn’t enough before she slipped off again.

“Ann, could you please stop? That might be dangerous…” Hope pleaded.

“Everything we do is dangerous. Why does this matter?”

I rolled my eyes and looked back at the computer, not taking my 2^(nd) clone’s word that the cell was moot. June had a fairly good idea; I may as well look into it. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem very feasible in the end, as we didn’t know what ports to plug the cables into once we unhooked our scientist, and even if we did, it appeared that trying to swap cores mid process would yield similar results to shutting it down. The high ground suddenly shifted from June to Ann. We were stuck.

*KA-THUNK!*

I heard Hope gasp beside me, and I snapped my head north to see what the fuss was. To my shock, Ann had the bar still in the cell, angled much lower this time than her previous attempts. She’d actually broken through.

Ann let out a hum of satisfaction as she adjusted the bar and continued to leverage, and while she did, the rest of us slowly moved to meet her. We may not have been in support of her little venture, but curiosity had us possessed, and we couldn’t stop ourselves from gliding forward and reaching out to help.

The half of the thick metal casing that Ann had managed loose was by no means light, and it took nearly all of us to begin working it loose. As we did, the hard, metallic shifting gave way to a moist, slimy crackle. We paused for a moment and exchanged looks before lifting more delicately, and it was then that we could understand the noise.

There was a rubber seal around the perimeter of the next layer, pulling taut as we attempted to wrestle its shell from it. Coating this elastic, however, was a slimy black goo like oil, slick and smelling of fresh rain. June let out a whine of dissatisfaction, but while we held it, Ann didn’t hold back before grabbing a box cutter from her pack and slicing along the seal’s side.

The plate became looser, and all at once, as it finally tore free, a new scent hit us, this one a vile swirl of rancid, sweet and chemical.

The rancid came from the object within the shell, something we couldn’t quite understand in the first few moments as we pulled the cover away. The sweet was from the same source, but the content of it was so radically different from what sweet things should be that I couldn’t tell if my brain was actually smelling the slightly floral scent correctly. The chemical was much easier to place. I’d smelled it before just a few moments ago outside, and even further back at my mother’s funeral home.

Formaldehyde.

Inside of the shell was a pale, organic object of abstract rounded edges. It contrasted the dark, sharp room so much that it made it even harder to process what we were seeing; not at all expecting *it* inside of a mechanical battery. It wasn’t until a few moments passed that the bile began to churn in my stomach, and I was worried that another Hensley may come out.

I knew Kingfisher was not comprised of good people by this point, but I think I underestimated just how bad they really were.

It was a body. A slimy, bloated corpse tucked neatly into the cell as if it were nothing more than a pair of jeans in a suitcase. Their skin was pale and smooth under the dark gel that coated them, and the formaldehyde made sure that their skin was still in perfect shape .

I wish that was the least of it. Just a body crammed into a tube that was once used as a battery to power a wicked machine.

It wasn’t.

Their head was shaved bald. I started there because I couldn’t quite handle their face. They practically had none to speak of. They had a nose still; that was in tact with tubes running into it that disappeared into the case. But where their eyes and mouth once were, there was now nothing but puffy, wrinkled folds of inflamed skin that covered the orifices. If you looked hard at the almost translucent soaked skin, you could barely make out lips beneath the rashes, and it was then that my brain finally clicked hard and violently like two magnets crashing together.

They had cauterized over them. Pulled skin up like a blindfold and mask, then seared it over the victims only way to sense what was happening. Their only way to scream for help…

Their body was almost worse. There were cables plugged into it at the same spots we found them in the scientists, but unlike them, apparently these bodies wouldn’t fit inside the neat little cell without some help. Their arms and legs were sawed off and stitched into stumps, leaving the corpse nothing but a torso and a head. Only the essentials to function.

It was that thought that reminded me of the worst truth of all.

I was calling this person a corpse, but that wasn’t true; at least, not at one point. These were batteries that needed to be alive to function. When they had their arms cut off, when they had their eyes and mouth stitched over before being shoved into this tube, when they were jacked into this machine for God knows how long…

They were still alive for all of it.

I somehow managed to keep my cool, too frozen in horror at the atrocity before me, but Hope and I nearly dropped the lid as June couldn’t do the same. She let out a whimper and released her grip, falling to the wall and dry heaving heavily. Ann backed away and looked down at the cylinder in horror before clearing her throat and moving close. She took the slack that June had let down, then aided me and Hope in placing it back over the body. The radiating stench instantly lessened, but wisps of it still clung in the air like an unleashed curse.

Lord knows the images in my head didn’t go away so easily.

Each of us stared down in horror at the cell, and June joined us once again after getting her nausea under control. We didn’t say a word to one another about what we’d just witnessed. There was really no need. Every single one of us had already put together everything we wanted to know about the cell, and that was that.

Slowly, the momentary distraction faded from our heads, and the sounds at the metal door drew us back to our current situation. The snake outside was no longer pounding, but it sounded like it had changed its goal to scratching. We could hear its massive form scraping and writhing against the barrier, followed by a zap from the gate every few moments. It still wasn’t deterring it, though, which meant that we were still where we began, only now bearing new mental scars.

I turned to the machine where the scientist was still stuck and took a few steps closer, the tips of my toes barely missing the pool of blood formed before it. Within, the poor fool still made small noises and movements that signified his body was ready to give out any moment now. That’s what made June’s next words so stressful.

“So… we don’t have any other options, then? We have to wait for it to leave?”

“Yeah,” I said softly, “More waiting.”

“Well, look on the bright side,” Ann darkly scoffed, “When that beast we’re waiting on finally comes back up from below, it’ll have a hard time finding us hidden away in here.”

I turned to face her, and though June seemed actually soothed by the words, Ann’s face didn’t portray the same confidence. Her expression was almost venomous. I thought it might be left over from the fight we’d just had, but then I remembered that she’d heard everything Hope and I had talked about in the break room. She heard me confess to her about my dream. She knew that time was as short as ever, and even if we got out of here alive, we still had one more rig to go before Il-Belliegħa showed up.

The wick was burning to its end faster with every hour.

I turned my gaze away from her, not giving her any more satisfaction over me, then moved to the far wall, taking my pack off and slouching against it. Hope and June did the same.

It's amazing how easy it is for us to fall asleep in this place. It’s made us light sleepers, sure, but the fact that our bodies are able to rest at all while surrounded by screaming and pounding outside is a miracle unto itself. We hadn’t even last slept more than 6 hours ago, but that doesn’t matter for our bodies. Fatigue and drowsiness is just something that comes with the rampant cancer slowly choking out or functions, and besides, we never really get a solid night’s rest, anyway.

Hope and June drifted off fairly fast against the wall beneath the control platform, leaning on each other’s shoulders. Ann took the wall opposite us next to the shell, and though I could tell she didn’t want to be near it, I think her desire to avoid me outweighed it. It looked like she dozed off a little while after them.

I didn’t sleep, though. I stayed up not only because I was worried about the door, but also because my brain was still too clogged. With Ann’s words, with the stress of getting out of here. The usual barbed wire that had been tangling my brain since we arrived.

Watching the girls sleep was another thing keeping me up. It’s an odd feeling seeing yourself asleep. It’s almost like an out-of-body experience. Like you could imagine what it would be like to die and float outside of your corpse, looking down on yourself as you lay motionless and still. Looking at Hope nestled against June, I wondered how many times Trevor had done this very thing; watching me while we lay together in bed and studying my features as I slept. My heart ached at the thought, and for a moment, I could see what he probably saw.

I still didn’t like a lot about myself, but getting to know Hope and June and their drastically different personalities, it was hard to even look at them as ‘me’. Seeing their innocent, peaceful faces lying there against each other, keeping comfort in such a time of panic and fear, I felt something tug in my heart that I hadn’t been able to feel in a long, long time.

A sense of care for myself. A sense of love, I suppose.

That was what kept me up about them. What could I do now if one of them died? If part of me went missing—a good part, like them?

My mind was drawn back to the lump of flesh currently forming at the bottom of the cliff; the one that I failed to keep safe. I couldn’t stop wondering if she was okay. Wondering if she’d already woken up and began wandering the streets alone. Would she find the radio tower, or would something find her first? What part of me was she? It was the Warehouse that birthed her; a time of my life that I wasn’t necessarily proud of.

Then again, it was also where I met Trevor, and he was everything good. Maybe that’s what she was. Maybe she would be something kind and gentle like him.

*‘That’s what Trevor is, though.’* I reminded myself, *‘We never were those things for him, even after he found us.’*

I swallowed and shut my eyes, laying my head back against the concrete wall as shame came flooding in. The things I said to him. The way I acted. The night that I left…

I didn’t fall asleep, but I let myself slip into a hazy trance of memory and regret there against the wall, my eyes shut and breathing slowly. I don’t know how long I lay like that until reality slowly began to bleed back in. The buzz of the overhead lights, the scientist’s tiny spasms, and the faint smell of the cylinder still burned into my nostrils. I listened for the noise coming from the door, but in my meditation, I hadn’t even noticed that it had stopped.

I scrunched my eyes shut even tighter and did my best to listen out past the thick wall, but sure enough, I didn’t hear anything. Just the sounds of the girls breathing softly as they rested and the gentle hum of machinery. There was something else, however. A tiny, barely noticeable mechanical clicking every now and then coming from the opposite wall.

I opened my eyes and lifted my head to see Ann was also awake like me, laptop pulled out of her bag and resting on her lap. She had a determined look on her face as her hands slipped about on the keyboard, sifting through the computer's contents unaware that I was watching her.

Her face wasn’t nearly as peaceful to look at as June and Hope’s were, but even still, seeing her resolve to get out of this place and knowing the pain she was going through, even if it was piled on with bitterness and wrath, I couldn’t help but feel a bit for her what I felt for my other halves earlier. It had been a while since our argument, enough for my usual impulsiveness to finally wind down, and I pursed my lips, knowing that I needed to say something to her.

Quietly, letting Hope and June rest a little longer, I stood and began moving over.

Ann jumped in surprise when she saw my figure approach over the top of the screen, and for a moment, I could see in her eyes a flicker of dread. A hope that I wouldn’t come over and just leave her be. I wasn’t going to be deterred so easily, however. We needed to not let the bitterness hang in the air.

I heard her release a sigh and saw her tense her jaw before clicking a few times and slapping the laptop closed. She let it rest on her thighs as she crossed her arms and looked back up at me, her expression now plain and warning. That actually almost was enough to deter me, not because I was scared of her, but because I really didn’t feel like a rehash of earlier. Ann was me, though, and I knew it was only a defense mechanism. More bark than actual bite.

Unsure of how to begin, I leaned against the wall and pointed to the door, “How long ago did it stop?”

“Not long.” She shot back quickly, “It’s still there, though.”

“How do you know?”

“It changes to that screaming thing when it goes through the hospital section,” Ann explained, “If it passed back out of the room, we would have heard it as it left.”

I nodded, impressed by her conclusion. The space fell silent again, and I felt my usual desire to give up and let things stew, but I pushed harder to keep the conversation alive.

“What were you up to?”

“Just more research into this place. Looking for more clues.”

“Still no luck?”

“No.”

I nodded, then stepped back right to where I’d started for a second time. I needed to stop beating around the bush. Part of me was waiting for Ann to lead the charge and apologize for what she’d said, but I knew this part of myself well by now, and she wasn’t going to be the one to do it first.

“Ann, about earlier in that room—”

She cut me off fast, “Hensley, it’s fine. We don’t need to do this dance every time we get into a spat with one another. We’re both assholes, and we both say a lot of shit to one another when we’re upset. We know that by now, and we know that it doesn’t always mean something.”

I felt a small kick of anger inject into my veins at her shutting me down, but as her actual words landed on me, I realized that she sort of had a point. Our petty personalities didn’t excuse the poor behavior, but right now, in this place, with just ourselves for company, we knew our own intentions better than anyone. The fight was rough, and I knew Ann meant a lot of what she said, but it was probably fueled by emotions first and foremost.

After all, I’d said a lot of things to Trevor the night I left that I meant, but knew were wrong too. We all sometimes open cans of worms that we’re not ready to actually use.

Still, looking down at Ann, I could still see anger and bitterness in her eyes. A tell that while she meant what she was saying, she was still holding on to something. I knew the best way to earn her forgiveness was by not pushing it, though, so I simply nodded to her, and softly spoke.

“I’m sorry. For getting us into this mess.” I told her earnestly, “I promise I’ll get us out.”

That sting behind her gaze visibly melted off, and was replaced by something new at my words. A hollow, distant guilt. Her eyes shied from mine, but her arms stayed crossed and her voice stayed its determined, intense tone, “It’s fine, Hen. You didn’t know. Let’s just drop it.”

It wasn’t much in way of an apology, but for Ann, the look in her eyes told me that’s what she meant it to be. At least, I was pretty sure. The fact that her eyes never returned to mine made me feel like maybe it was something deeper, but that had to be put on the back burner.

Frantic screaming rang out from the door behind us, jarring Hope and June awake and calling Ann to her feet. I listened carefully as the wails continued for a few seconds before shifting back into dead silence, then nothing at all. It had passed through the hospital section of the room. It was leaving.

“What was that? Was that that thing?” June questioned.

“It was our sign to get out of here,” I told her, moving up for the control panel.

“We need to wait a second, it’s going to hear the door and come right back,” Ann snapped up to me.

“Yeah, I know,” I scoffed, “I’m just checking the system one more time.”

The terminal hadn’t changed much in appearance, but there were numbers that were certainly lower than before, and a few warning ones that were even higher. I pulled my gaze up to the scientist in the hole and pursed my lips.

Hope saw my concern, “Is it going to be okay?”

I shook my head and looked at her, “I think this one is going to be similar to Zane's. We’re going to have to run for it before the whole thing melts down. Are you all ready for that?”

Hope’s face showed fear, but she swallowed it down, then nodded. June looked at her, then back to me and did the same.

“Whatever we gotta’ do to get out of here,” Ann said, her face plain and cold, “We’re burning daylight.”

It was a funny way to word it given the eternal darkness we were trapped in, but I got what she meant. Slowly I made my way down to them, and together, we waded out into the blood to grab the scientist from the machine.

As we lay him on the floor, then knelt next to him, we all stared at one another, counting down the seconds till we needed to pull the plug. Nobody spoke other than to lay out a general plan for our exit, but we didn’t need to. We’d done this song and dance so many times before now that we were practically one.

We *were* one. A hive mind of my own making that while splintered, still had that one core value that glued us together.

Stubbornness. We weren’t going to let this place win.

It's clear when I talk to the girls that even though we each embody some different part of me, we all affected each other just the same. June has parts of Hope's kindness, Hope has the ability to feel Ann’s drive and anger, and Ann has my unfortunate awareness of just how shitty we are.

Like it or not, Ann was me. Her flaws, her attitude, her anger. Those days before my mother's death, there wasn’t four of us yet. I was Hope, and I was June, and while I didn’t know exactly when those two came to be in my mind, I could pin the exact moment that Ann entered my heart.

It was those hours sitting on those benches between a hospital and a funeral home, letting the passing vultures pick at my raw wounds until they’d swallowed up every part of me that was Hope and June. The marred flesh and frail bones that they’d left behind was Ann, and her scabs never quite healed right after that.

As I stared at her across the circle from me, that damaged, angry look still in her eyes, I just hoped that the things she’d said to me, and the wounds she was still carrying, weren’t enough to fully break her down.

After around 20 minutes, we popped the chords from the scientist's body, and the entire room began to rumble and sway. We were already to the door and pounding the ‘open’ button before it stopped.
