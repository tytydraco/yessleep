The 90’s was the period that made me. Too young to be an 80’s baby (1988 is close enough ok?) I was forced to grow up outside of the metal hair trend and in the era of the boy band haircuts and grunge flannel. To be honest, it wasn’t so bad.

Recently, however, something resurfaced after many years that made me revisit my childhood in my memories to put together some missing pieces. 

My mother recorded everything. In the 90’s the cameras were huge and I was shocked that she didn’t have a permanent dent in her shoulder from carrying that damn thing around, asking us to look at the camera and tell her what we were getting up to. There were hours and hours of tapes in mom’s basement covering my birth, birthday parties, school activities, ball games and hours of just nothing- playing with toys and pretending (acting, I reminded Henry often).

Henry is my little brother. He was with me constantly and we were best friends. When I was around 9 or 10, however, Henry didn’t come home from school with me. I stepped off the bus and he was just…gone. Mom and Dad listened to my story and exchanged conversations with the police and put up flyers, but he was never heard from again. I know they tried their best, but sometimes…I just felt like they didn’t even care he was gone. 

Now, clearing out my mother’s basement while she and dad packed all their furniture for their move, I found myself hunting for our old VHS player, praying the heat and damp hadn’t ruined it. 

I snuck a couple small boxes with tapes that were interestingly labeled into my car. I knew I could have just asked, but after Henry disappeared, Mom was really protective over her tapes. I would tell her after I got them in there that I was just going to keep them safe until they got moved into their new home. 

Once I was home, I dug out the old CRT TV that I had in college (these smart TVs don’t ever wanna cooperate with old tech). I don’t know why I was nervous. They were just home movies. It would be a fun little trip down memory lane and getting to see Henry again after so long would be cool. I missed that kid.

I dug around in the tapes and found one I figured was one of the oldest. ‘Owen- age 1-3’.

I slid it in and the click of the VCR docking the tape took me back. The picture was a little wonky so I adjusted the settings a little until it was as clear as it could be. 



I was holding myself up against a bench at the park I recognized near my childhood home, spitting bubbles and smacking the seat. I couldn’t help but smile. I was a cute ass kid.

“What you doin’, bubba?” my mom’s younger voice said from beside the camera. I smiled at her and laughed.

That went on for a few minutes then the camera cut to me a little older, my hair coated in what looked to be straight red dirt.

“Owen, you are filthy!” my mother laughed. “What did you do!?”

I laughed and shook my head. “No…Henry!”

I furrowed my brow…Henry? Surely he wasn’t big enough to dump dirt on my head…Henry was 6 when he disappeared. He shouldn’t have been born yet.

“Well, Henry, that wasn’t nice,” Mom said. The camera cut again and I was in the bath playing with toys and talking. I was about 3, I believe. 

“You’re getting water everywhere, Owen,” Mom said in a rushed tone. “Give me a sec to put this camera down and I’ll get you out,” she walked over to the vanity and placed the camera down. I don’t know if she meant to leave it running or not but it faced the sliding mirror door of the closet in her bathroom. I could see the top of my head and my mom, helping me out and drying me off. 

Then…blocking the camera briefly…was an eye.

I blinked rapidly and rewinded the video. “What the…”

I played it back and tried to pause it just in time, finally catching it at just the right time. The eye was peaking into the lens, as if it was looking for something. The eye was bloodshot and dark. I tried to make out features of the person the eye belonged to, but it was all shadow around the single piercing eye. 

The tape ended and I just sat there, staring at the TV for a moment. What the hell was that? I asked myself. The only ones in the house would have been me, mom and dad…but this was after Henry had dumped dirt on my head…

I shook my head and rolled my eyes. Surely it was a coincidence. Maybe I had an imaginary friend named Henry too and mom liked the name enough to give it to my brother. Weird, but not totally unrealistic.

I was a little surprised the tape was so corrupted. It was in short bursts of memories. I saw there was more tape here but it seemed to skip around. 



I pulled out another tape. It was one of those old 8mm video cassettes that needed the adapter and thankfully Mom was a borderline hoarder and I was able to find a working one. She had upgraded the camera at some point and these little tapes were the bane of my existence. They were super delicate and flimsy, but I carefully slid the next tape into the adapter. This was labeled ‘Owen 4th birthday; Homestead’



The film scratched to life and there was little old me, sitting in my grandma’s kitchen with a large Scooby Doo birthday cake with a flaming ‘4’ candle flickering with every excited move I made. My family was standing around singing and I blew out my candle to applause. Mom filmed around the kitchen. I noticed something…odd near the entrance to the living room.

Sitting on the floor holding a red ball was a little boy, maybe 3? He was looking over at us, staring blankly. He kind of looked like Henry, but again…I was 3 when Henry came along. He should only be a baby.

The boy stared for a long time then stood up. The screen around him seemed to flicker like heat waves coming off hot asphalt. I tried to look between the lines, but I couldn’t pick up on anything. Just a glitch, I guess. I wish I knew who that kid was. Surely that wasn’t Henry. I was sure it was some neighborhood kid or cousin I forgot about. Henry would have just been 1 at my 4th birthday. 

The next little while was just me opening presents and eating cake. I scanned occasionally for the little boy again but I didn’t see him. I also didn’t see my infant brother. Why would he not be there?



The next tape was one of mom’s many tapes of what I have dubbed ‘world-building’. She filmed the front yard and talked about the cows and horses in the pasture beyond. She then scanned around looking through our yard and out toward the barn where my dad was spraying down his barrel race horse Shadow. She talked about how dad was getting Shadow ready for the coming county fair and bragged about my riding lessons. 

“He’s getting strong even for a 7 year old,” she said proudly. “I think he’s out here somewhere,” she walked around the back of the house and I heard the springs on the trampoline groaning under mine and Henry’s weight.

“Hey, bud,” she called to me, pointing the camera at us. “What’s up?”

“Just jumping with Henry. Look, I can backflip now!” I demonstrated a semi-decent backflip and Henry clapped.

“Good job, Owen,” mom laughed. 

“Look, Henry can do one too!”

Henry copied me and my mom said in a shaky voice. “How did you do that?”

“Do what?” I asked, looking confused.

“It just…looked like the trampoline was bouncing but you weren’t…” she trailed.

“Well, yea mom cuz Henry was jumping,” I rolled my eyes and went back to my jumping. Henry wasn’t joining me. He was staring off toward the camera and my mom. 

“Weird,” I heard her mumble and turn away. 



I remembered that day. I remember a little while later that Henry and I got into a fight and he pushed me off the trampoline. I sprained my wrist and wasn’t able to ride at the county fair rodeo that Saturday. I remember asking him why he did it, but all I got was a smile and a shrug. Mom and I argued many times about Henry. I was super protective of him because he was so small. I knew Mom and Dad loved Henry- he was their son- but sometimes it felt as if they just tried to pretend he wasn’t there. They were never mean to him, though. My brain was scrambled. 

I dug around a little and found one I found interesting because it was labeled with a name I didn’t recognize. “Father Peters”.

We aren’t Catholic. My dad is a proud protestant. Why on earth would they have a video of someone named Father Peters? It was probably one of Mom’s British soaps or something.

I put the tape in and sat back on the floor, drawing my knees up to my chest. I was becoming more and more unnerved by all the things I couldn’t remember.

 

“Ok…you said it’s ok if I film this?”

“Maggie films everything,” grumbled Dad. She must had popped him lightly on the arm because he chuckled a little off to the side of the camera. The priest- Father Peters, I assumed- was sitting in our living room. Mom and Dad sat on the love seat adjacent to it. 

“So…I don’t really know how to say this and I don’t really know what is going on but…I think something is wrong with my son, Owen.”

I sat up a little, a stir in my gut. I don’t remember being sick or anything. 

“He has…an imaginary friend? He calls him his brother. Henry.”

“What does he say this imaginary friend looks like?” the priest asked patiently. 

“He has never described him,” Dad answered. “Like she said, he thinks he’s his brother. I guess he thinks we should know what he looks like.”

The priest nodded. “Do you feel like this…Henry…is malicious?”

Mom wrung her hands in her lap. “There have been times when something would happen to Owen or I would get onto him for doing something and he would say it was Henry. Henry pushed him off the trampoline or Henry kicked the horse too hard and made him run off. I found him carving his and Henry’s names in his bedside table with a knife once. He said Henry told him to. Father, I don’t know what this is, but it doesn’t feel normal. I’ve talked to my therapist and his doctor and they keep trying to tell me this is normal for a little boy to have an imaginary friend-”

“-but you don’t believe that is what is with your son,” the priest finished. His hardened face was relaxing a little, seeing the apprehension in my mom’s eyes. Dad took her hand.

“Look, I don’t really believe in all that spooky stuff and monsters and all that,” my Dad sat forward, his broad shoulders slumping a little as he leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees. “I do know that something evil is in this house. Has been for a while. I just want my family safe.”

The priest studied my parents for a moment, then nodded. “I can pray over the house for now. I have other people I want involved, if you are willing to be…open-minded.”

My mom immediately nodded, followed by my dad.

“I’ll give you some instructions and get back with you as soon as I can. Where is Owen?”

“School,” Mom answered. “He doesn’t need to know about this until the absolute last minute. Please.”

“No, I understand. I want to meet him soon-”

The camera fritz a little. Something passed in front of the camera. It wasn’t a person…but it looked like one. Just a passing wave of glitchy shadow. My mom and dad were standing up and moving around but the priest- his eyes were trained on the area to the left of the camera, his hardened appearance returning. As my parents turned around he quickly muttered to himself and made The Sign of the Cross over his chest. Something he saw had scared him. 

I couldn’t believe it. How do I not remember this priest? I must not have met him like he wanted.

I was wrong.

A moment of static then a shot of our living room came into view. I was sitting at the table with Henry coloring. I was about 7 again. 

“Hello, Owen,” the priest’s voice came from off camera and he approached and sat across from me at the table. I heard my mom clear her throat on the other side of the camera. “How have you been?”

“Fine,” I answered softly. Henry was looking between me and the Father, his coloring page abandoned. 

“Do you remember me from last week?”

“Yes,” I answered. I didn’t sound right…I sounded scared. I was always a friendly kid and never treated adults so nonchalantly. 

“How has it been with your brother?” he asked. Henry’s eyes settled on me. 

“He’s good,” I said. “He’s coloring with me, see?”

I pointed to the page in front of Henry. He didn’t take his eyes off me.

“I see…Owen, is there anywhere we can go to talk without Henry? I just want to talk to you by yourself.”

“Henry gets scared when I’m not there. I don’t want him to be scared.”

“What if he stays with your mom?”

Henry saw I was about to agree. I saw him reach over and pinch my leg. I grimaced and jumped a little. 

“No, I don’t want to. I want to stay right here,” I said harshly.

The priest nodded. “Ok, ok…that’s fine. Did my prayers make him angry?”

Henry- small, frail little brother Henry- cracked his neck…wincing as if the sound of the word was a hot iron.

“He doesn’t believe in God.”

“Really? What does he believe in?”

I shrugged. “I don’t know. He just says he doesn’t need God.”

The priest chanced a look over at my mom, who I heard stifling a wet sigh. “Do you believe in God, Owen?”

I knew, as my older self, I wasn’t really into the idea of religion. I just wanted to believe things to be simple. Religions are politics these days and I don’t care for either one.

My younger self, however, was a Vacation Bible School kid, a Sunday night service kid, and a Tuesday afternoon kids’ choir kid. If it happened at the church, Mom had me there.

“I mean, I guess. I go to church with Mom and Dad.”

“Does Henry go with you?”

I could see myself thinking hard, wracking my brain to try and remember…

I never saw him on Sunday mornings, at VBS, or a kids’ choir…I never saw him in the church.

Henry was boring a hole into the side of my head. “Yes he does,” he whispered to me.

“Yes, he does,” I answered on the camera. 

My jaw dropped. Henry had just told me to lie…the tone with which I repeated his words was flat. Not like my voice at all.

The Father looked at the empty seat beside me. He couldn’t see him.

The realization of years of my life being a facade crumbled around me. My breath hitched in my chest. 

He couldn’t see him…Mom and Dad couldn’t see him. He was…invisible? A ghost? 

A rumble in my spirit- deep inside me- told me that this was more than just that. There wouldn’t be a priest in our home for an invisible kid or a ghost…

Just before the camera went off, Henry looked directly at the camera. I felt his eyes traveling through the lens and through time to stare directly at me. I quickly ejected the tape and felt myself starting to panic. I had so many good memories of my brother. Were they real? Did…Henry put them there to make me forget? I don’t even remember the video I just watched. I don’t remember ever meeting Father Peters or any prayers he said in our house or some ‘Exorcist’ demonstration…

I buried my head in my hands. The day Henry disappeared was muddy, but I could still see it. I had been talking to him about the Pokemon cards I was gonna trade to my friend for a cigarette the next day and we got to our stop. I stepped off the bus, but he didn’t. I looked around for him, but he wasn’t there. I know he was behind me. I could feel him right there behind me walking down the steps.

I ran home to see if he had taken off to the house but he wasn’t there. I told Mom and Dad about him being right behind me then he was gone. I wish Mom had been filming in this moment. I wish I could have looked at their faces again when I told them Henry was gone. 

I grinded my teeth…the ‘missing’ posters, the ‘phone call’ to the police…did they do that to trick me? To make me think my little brother was really just missing so I would move on? I felt hot tears stinging my eyes. I was angry. Why didn’t they just tell me? 

Then I said to myself, ‘Well…they probably did. You seem to have forgotten everything else’.

I trained my eyes back toward the box of tapes, feeling sick at the sight of them.

At the bottom I discovered another small tape: this one unlike all of them I had ever seen before, it was bare. No label or indication as to what was on it. After all I had seen, I was very nervous to see what some mysterious tape held…my foundation of beliefs had been cracked that day.

I placed the tape into the adapter and prepared myself.

“Ok, ok, hold on, I gotta remember how she uses it.”

My voice. I wasn’t terribly old…8 or 9? I was still a squeaker. This was right around the time Henry disappeared.

After fumbling a little, I lifted the camera and trained it on Henry. A chill ran over my skin. I hated that my memory of him was so… blemished now. He was my best friend for so long and I loved him. Now, his face made me feel like running away.

“Ok, Henry, tell the camera what you told me.”

“What about?”

“The story you told me! It’s so cool and spooky.”

Henry blinked and looked down then back up into the camera- into my eyes almost 20 years later. I have no memory of this.

“Ok…well, a long time ago, when the animals and people were being made, a great big snake was creeping through the garden. He was sniffing for food and looking for friends to play with him when he came to a big lion. The lion told him no one wanted him in the garden and he had to leave.”

I felt a little stir of familiarity…

“The snake was sad, but he slithered away. He tried again to come back, but the big lion told him to leave again. This time, the snake didn’t leave. He waited until the lion was gone and went to the home the man and lady who took care of all the animals and the garden-”

“Hurry up, get to the scary part,” my younger self urged him.

“I’m getting there,” Henry said patiently. Too patiently for a child who had been cut off during a story.

“He went to the woman and whispered in her ear while she slept. He told her the lion was trying to hurt her and she shouldn’t ever listen to him again. Then one day, the snake heard crying in the garden. The lion was roaring at the woman and he made her bleed from her legs…”

I felt sick. 

“The lion ran over and grabbed the snake with his teeth and threw him all the way down into a dark, dark hole. The snake was all alone…but he made new friends from other snakes that were thrown in the hole. He became a king and helped all the other snakes get back home. One day, really soon, the snake will come back and take all his other snakes home to fight the lion.”

“Dude, snakes are so freaky,” my younger self chuckled. “How’s a bunch of snakes gonna beat a lion though? Lions are pretty freakin’ strong.”

The look on Henry’s face was cold, but he tilted the corner of his mouth upward and shrugged.

“Everything has a weak spot.”

The screen around Henry shifted again as it had before, but this time, behind him, was a mass of darkness. It towered over him and caused the tape to flicker a little. 

“You weird me out sometimes, Hank,” I laughed. “That’s a cool story, though.”

I seemed to put the camera down quickly, obviously hearing my mother’s footsteps coming down the stairs to the basement. I heard a hurried conversation offside, barely audible but just clear enough.

“What are you doing down here? I’ve told you to stay out!”

“Me and Henry were just-”

“Honey, stop trying to say Henry made you do things. He’s not real!”

“He is real! Why would you say that!?”

On the screen, Henry was watching the conversation, a smirk on his face. It was alarming to look at. He looked back over to the camera and leaned in.

“Hey, Owen.”

I sat back away from the screen, feeling my skin crawling like spiders had been dumped over my head. 

“Don’t worry about what Mom says- I’m always gonna be with you.”

The video cut just as I heard my mother say, “I’m calling Father Peters again…it must not have worked.”

I sat, staring at the blank static of the TV, the image of my brother baked into the background. A creak of wood behind me hitched my breath. I have no pets, no roommates…no one. I took a breath and stood slowly, making my way toward the front door. I had to get out of the house. Whatever Henry was…getting rid of him didn’t work. I had to talk to my mom.

I reached up and the door…there’s no knob.

I blinked quickly and looked back. No knob. 

“What the fuck,” I stammered, looking around. “Where are you!?”

I felt stupid, but I was sure I wasn’t alone. I stumbled through the house toward the back door and I reached up and-

“Come on!” I screamed. No knob. 

I tried the windows. The locks wouldn’t move.

I tried to break them. They may have just as well been made of diamond.

I slammed my boot into the door, trying to break the frame and set myself free, but all I got was a sore foot. 

A low, deep sound caused me to stop. It was like a sigh. I didn’t wanna turn around. 

“H-henry,” I breathed out. 

Creak…creak…creak… 

“Don’t come any closer to me,” I growled. “What are you?”

Creak…creak…creak…

“Let me out, dammit! I’m not s-scared of you!” My stutter didn’t sound assuring I know, but maybe showing resistance would help. 

It didn’t.

Pain- deep, searing pain trickled down my spine. My back bowed and I hit my knees. Sounds filled my ears that could only be in my head. Screams, pleas, and the sounds of…flames. Licking flames. I could feel the heat of them just through the cracking and popping of them. My vision was flooded with writhing bodies- snakes’ bodies. In the jaws of the largest snake- a lion, limp and lifeless.

I felt my body disappear. I felt like I was in nothingness. Only for a split second then I woke up on the floor, feeling my body aching and shivering. 

I turned as quickly as I could and looked around. The silence was deafening. I couldn’t see anything, but I could feel it. I threw open the door, knob returned to its place, and ran toward my truck, desperate to drive as fast as I could away from whatever Hell I had just been burdened with. 

I shouldn’t have watched the tapes.

I should have just let my brother be a memory that lived in my mind only. I knew I had to talk to mom and dad about this. Other people in my life must have noticed him there. Whatever he was, I didn’t want him to stay. I didn’t know what this was gonna mean for me going forward but I couldn’t keep it to myself. If you knew me back then, please answer this question:

Do you remember my brother Henry?
