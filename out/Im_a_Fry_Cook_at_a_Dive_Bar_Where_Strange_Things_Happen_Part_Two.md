Dave started acting strange after Henry took his time off. He came up to me one morning before we opened. His eyes were never stationary. He was constantly looking around the kitchen. His black hair was unkempt and he obviously hadn’t shaved in a few days. I assumed it was because he was worried that Henry would sue him or leave. It isn’t a secret that Dave is having a hard time getting replacement staff to cover his massive turnover. But he had never been this visibly stressed out before.

  
“Have you heard from Henry?” Dave leaned in close to my face and I almost pulled away. His breath smelled like he used skunk spray as mouthwash. He was whisper-shouting at me even though we were alone. I was opening today so Nathan and Jose weren’t in yet, lucky bastards. The front of house staff hadn’t even arrived yet. He had interrupted me in the process of gathering sanitizer buckets and rags to wipe down some of the line that wasn’t properly cleaned last night.

  
“No,” I said, trying not to gag from the smell of decay wafting into my face. “He has been MIA for a few days now. Of course, he’s been traumatized; so give him some time to recover.” I found myself whispering as well for some reason. I tried to stop but I felt too uncomfortable to raise my voice above the whisper we were currently using.

  
“He’s not recovering…he’s following me.” Dave’s eyes were wild as he glanced around as if Henry was hiding around every corner. “I don’t like being followed, Levi. You know I don’t like being followed.” The speed he was talking at kept increasing as he continued. “I’m a private person. I can’t have people following me. Levi, have you seen him?”

  
“Dave, are you on something?” I moved away from him a bit, no longer able to handle his breath. His frantic head shaking made me very skeptical. I kept whispering as I explained, “Henry isn’t following you around. You are paranoid. He has no reason to do that.” I happened to glance down and saw a pool of red forming up on the floor. I was confused until a drip fell from Dave’s hand and added to the blood on the floor. “Woah, Dave. Are you bleeding?” My whisper was finally broken by this distraction. He picked up his hand and looked at it blankly. 

  
Dave stopped whispering too as he responded, “I guess I am.” The stream of blood changed directions and moved back down his arm to the mystery source of the bleed. Whatever was bleeding was hidden under the sleeve of his shirt.

  
“Do you need me to look at it?” I reached for a few clean rags I was going to use to clean the line.

  
He pulled them out of my hand before I could reach for his sleeve and reveal the wound. “N-NO!” He practically shouted at me, “I can handle this myself.” He ran off. I thought he went to his office but he actually left the bar. I was left to clean up the mess his arm had made. I didn’t see him for the rest of the day. The bar ran fine without Dave, but I was more than a little disturbed by our interaction.  
Not long after that day, something new appeared in the bar. If it’s not new then it's rare. I’ve worked here for about a year and I had never experienced it before.

  
It was another night where I was the only one in the kitchen. Nathan and Jose had clocked out and gone home. The only people who had remained in the bar were a few servers and the bartender (Tommy). But because they are all front of house I don’t see them much. We haven’t had a dishwasher in a few months; So the only time I see the front of house is when they come back to clean the dishes they gathered from the losers that come 10 minutes before close.

  
The sound of the door swinging whenever a server or Tommy walked into the kitchen was so common I stopped noticing it. Which is why I didn’t think much of it when I heard someone spraying off the dishes. Someone must have drawn the short straw and had to wash all the dishes, I thought to myself. I heard the sounds of dishes clanking into the dish rack and the industrial dishwasher running. It slowly faded into my subconscious as I continued to mop the floor.

  
That was until I heard, “Who are you? What are you doing here?” I looked up and could barely see through the heat lamps over the expo-line. It sounded like Lisa, one of the servers, but I couldn’t be sure. The dishwasher still hummed in the background as it cleaned the dishes but the spraying had stopped. I was walking toward the dish room because I was curious as to what was happening. The deafening scream that came from the room sent me running. I was going so fast I almost fell as I ran around the corner of the line. There was no other sound as I ran to the dish area.

  
The dish-room was fairly small. It was a small three wall room with the fourth “wall” being an opening into the kitchen. This opening had a table to place the dirty dishes on. In the center of the back wall was the dishwasher. On both sides of it were metal tables that held the rack for the dishes. These racks could be slid into the dishwasher where they are cleaned and pushed out the other side. Currently a massive man was standing in front of the dishwasher. His back was to me so I couldn’t see his face. I looked around but didn’t see Lydia anywhere. The man turned and my breath caught in my throat. His lips and eyes were sewn shut. There was yellow pus dripping from his eyes and mouth. He had a button down shirt and blue jeans. Over the shirt was what used to be a white apron. Now it was caked in dirt. What was more startling was the blood that mixed with the dirt. The blood that came from a wide gash in his throat. He pointed to the table I was standing next to. I glanced over at it then back at him. He gestured again, more angry this time. “Look man I don’t know why you are here or what you want…b-but you’ve got to leave.” He scowled at me. The gash gurgled and bubbled as the stranger growled, sending a river of blood pouring down his apron.

  
As he began to walk toward me, I heard the sound of a dish rack being pushed out of the dishwasher. My eyes flicked over to the table that held the clean dishes. Sitting in the rack were pure white bones that were void of any gore. There were still clothes piled in with the bones. It was a server's apron with a name tag...Lydia. My eyes widened as they flicked back to the approaching wall of a man.

  
“Shit.”

  
I wanted to run but I was frozen in place. Even without eyes I felt like he was staring into my soul. Suddenly, someone stepped in front of me. It was Heather. She gently set down a few plates and a glass on the table. I looked back at the man expecting him to be reaching for me. I flinched back, his hand getting closer to me. Instead, he picked up the dishes next to me and lumbered back to his station. He began to spray them down and place them on the rack. I felt an icy cold grip on my wrist as Heather dragged me away.

  
When we were back to the fry station Heather finally let go. She turned to look at me. There was a look of pity on her face. Before I could thank her, she began to shimmer before disappearing. The last thing I could see were her eyes. They had a knowing look to them. As if she knew what I was struggling with.

  
The rest of the night I was the one gathering dishes and bringing them to the dish-room. It seemed like the dishwasher, we named him Larry, wouldn’t attack us if we had dishes for him. Every time I walked up to the table, he’d be watching me. He would gesture to the table and seemed pleased when I put the dishes down. I noticed that he had placed Lydia’s…pieces on the drying rack to dry. I didn’t really want to know what he was going to do with them.

  
After the front-of-house was finished and gone, I called Dave and told him what had happened. He got to the restaurant in record time. He looked a lot better than he did last time I saw him. The manic look in his eyes was gone and his hair was clean and washed. “You can leave now, Levi.” He spoke in a matter-of-fact way.

  
“What? But I haven’t finished cleaning yet and Larry isn’t bad when-”

  
“Larry?” Dave said, cutting me off.

  
“Yes. Larry. It’s what I named him.”

  
Dave chuckled at this and nodded, “Larry…I like it.” He seemed to ponder on the name a little bit with a smile. “Well,” He put his hand on my shoulder, “I will clean up anything you’ve missed and I will handle ‘Larry.’” He said his name in a mocking tone before growing serious again. “Now go home. I’ll see you tomorrow.” His voice told me he would hold firm in me leaving, so I did. As I walked out, I heard Dave lock the door behind me.

  
The next morning I checked the news. We’ve lost a few employees before and every time they never end up in the news or the missing person’s registry. I don’t know how Dave does it but it’s like they ceased to exist. This time was no different. I’m sure I will go back to the restaurant where everyone will only mention Lydia in hushed whispers from the people who didn’t quit.
