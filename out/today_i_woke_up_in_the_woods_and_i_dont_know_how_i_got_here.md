Today i woke up in the woods and i don’t know how i got here…

Today i woke up in the woods, i don’t know how i got here or where i am. 

The last thing i remember before going to sleep was that i was reading about a fictional creature..What was it? I think it was a skinwalker? A skinwalker. yeah that’s what it was.

Something is out here with me i can hear it shuffling deeper in the woods, i fear for what might be out there

I found something under the leaves where i woke up..its a journal let me read it for you:

September 2nd, 2018 (7:35am)

I seem to have woken up in the middle of the woods and i don’t know how i got here. I wonder where here is? The last thing i remember is going to sleep.

I think the first thing i need to do is find some food, water and shelter before the sun goes down. The forest surrounding me is quiet as the sun is rising and the world is waking up. I start to travel downhill, i find a pond after walking for maybe 10 minutes. It appears to have fish, i only have a small pocket knife and a lighter so maybe later i can catch them and cook them. My main goal right now is shelter. I continue walking until i find a rocky overhand with foliage covering, this will work for now. I will work on gathering some sticks and logs to make a better shelter, i will write later.

I built some walls from small logs and sticks i found laying around. Now i want to focus on building a fire to cook some fish and settle down for the night as the sun is now setting. I make a circle and fill it with small sticks and some dry grass, i use my lighter and get a fire going. I now go and spear a few fish with my pocket knife. I skin them and roast them over the fire, it is night now i will keep the fire going while i sleep so i can stay warm. I will write in the morning.

It is the next morning, i hear things rustling in the woods behind me, i peak out to find a few rabbits playing around in the leaves. I decide to sneak up on them and spear one with my pocket knife. I skinned the rabbit and gutted it just like my father had taught me. I roasted it over the fire and ate it before settling in before going to sleep. Good night

September 4th 2018 (11:25am)

I haven’t been able to sleep well the past 2 nights as it seems the creature only shows up after midnight. I think i will start hunting at sunrise, eat and sleep during the day so i am awake when it comes back. I will put out the fire before settling in so it doesn’t attract the creature.

September 5th 2018 (1:23am)

I’ve been looking for any signs of life since my last writing and i can’t seem to find anything, i walked back to where i woke up and didn’t see anything. I heard the creature trying to get me to come deeper in the woods but i didn’t listen to it. I ran back to my shelter and tried to stay calm, i don’t hear it walking around anymore hopefully it went back to its home.

September 6th 2018 (6:30am)

Today is the day, i spent last night making spears out of rocks and longer sticks, it is time for my long dangerous journey, i need to leave this journal here just in case this ever happens to someone else. 

Good Bye 

Not exactly what i was expecting to read but i think i will follow what the writer did and try to find the shelter and the pond.

After walking for about 10 minutes i found the shelter and the pond. In the shelter was a lot of firewood, and the pocket knife the writer had in their pocket. 

After walking around in the woods for a while i realized the writer was wrong about the creature, it walked around in the day time too but only in the shady parts of the woods. I think it is scared of the light of day, so my best decision would be to make a run for the city in the daylight but it is still very dangerous. 

It’s sunset now and i’ve carved a few spears, i am sitting here trying not to fall asleep because who knows what could happen if i drift off into sleep?

I made it through the first night as i saw the light of the sun start to shine through the trees. I think i will leave the journal where i woke up just in case.

Spear in hand i left the journal where i woke up and started to head south, i had a feeling this was going to be a long walk. 

After about 2 hours of walking, nothing has happened. I can see a hill in front of me and the horizon just above it. 

The hill was a little bit steeper than it looked but i managed to scale it. I can see the city now, i hope there is someone there that can help me. The sun is directly above me and it is a little too hot for my liking i am drenched in sweat. I sure hope i can make it to the city before nightfall. 

It’s about 6:00pm i think and i have a small issue, it seems as the creature is waiting for me. It has been following me in the shady parts of the woods since i left this morning. Now i have to make it to the city before nightfall. 

I started to run and i can see the city clearer now, Unlucky me the sun is setting and the creature is about 700 feet in front of me.

The creature charged at me but it missed me and i started running faster, it tripped but got back up and charged at me again. It’s antlers stabbed me in 4 different places and i was bleeding but i kept running. As soon as i reached the city the creature stopped, i think it might be confined to the woods. 

I knocked on the first door i saw and collapsed into the arms of the man who opened the door. 

He looked at me with fear and worry but mostly worry. No questions asked, she drove me to the hospital. i was safe at last, i am never going into the woods again

EVER.
