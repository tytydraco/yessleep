It had been a long time since I saw my friends, precisely, 14 months; the work I have as a kitchen manager working double shifts has made me lose touch with the reality of my life, but with the arrival of a new job opportunity that opened the doors to a better schedule and a truly relieving salary, things were looking up. I have been starting this new job and it truly is much better than the one I had, feeling how the light from the outside now illuminated my daily paths, opening the way to new friendships and unexpected reunions with people I thought I would never see again.

"I'm really glad you came!" Skyler said, very excited. "Hector mentioned he was eager to see his favorite idiot," She mentioned with a big smile on her face.

"I'm glad too," I mentioned, very relaxed and letting out a light laugh. "It's been so long since I saw you all, and I really needed this." I ran my left hand over my face, letting out a sigh of relief. "I was fed up with all the stress."

We were walking on the sidewalk towards the "Antesala" restaurant, where we would have the reunion dinner with some friends. Skyler still had that beautiful face I had known for 10 years; the blonde hair really suited her. Such tranquility seemed so unreal to me, I thought I always had to be in a constant cycle of chaos to make sense of things, apparently, my own mind had been meticulously designing the way to face my issues, only falling into the mistake of doing things we thought were right. Upon entering the restaurant, there was a table near the entrance where my other 5 friends were sitting, filling me with absolute happiness to see them again and greet them, returning to those moments when all of this was common, bringing back that spark of happiness that characterized me. 

We sat down and caught up with each other, sharing anecdotes and nonsense, noticing in my periphery a news report on one of the restaurant's screens mentioning the murder of a man named Ramiro Quintana, which happened in the same place where my brother made Josue Vasconcelos take the lives of those people for reasons I still donâ€™t know.

"Beto, are you okay?" Daniel asked, with a sweet tone.

"Huh? Yeah man, everything's fine."

It was like reliving it all, those news articles that sent chills down my spine as I read how my brother's actions were recounted. I never understood what was going on in his mind; we may be brothers, but we weren't that close. The age gap between us, combined with our schedules, made it impossible for us to spend time together, not getting to know each other very well. He was locked up, sentenced to spend a long time in prison for the acts he committed; I never visited him, I couldn't look him in the eyes after what he did. It wasn't easy for me, all of this took me by surprise, just like the gunshots that rang out outside the restaurant, forcing us to hide under the table, remembering the remnants of my survival story from my time in Sinaloa, everything around me was clouded, urging my friends and me to leave the table, now being attacked by smoke bombs as they attempted the lives of the other diners.

Within that haze came the cries of an enraged man shouting my name, petrifying me as I realized they were coming from my brother. How did he escape? I didn't have time to think, we had to run. As we made our way to the exit, we noticed the restaurant was surrounded by people in white robes. Skyler let out a scream that took us all by surprise.

"What is that?!" Dana screamed, and we turned around. Before we could react, we noticed two men in the crowd, their legs apart and their arms intertwined above their heads, placed in a parallel position, forming a figure resembling a hexagon.

We decided to take refuge in the kitchen, noticing that two of our friends were left behind. The fog was really dense, and as we tried to go back for them, those 'sectarians' in white robes were opening them from the chest to the neck, while a giant figure loomed from the end of the room. Skyler called me; they had found a way to escape through the back door of the kitchen. Desperately, we ran towards that door, and when we opened it, massive sectarians were waiting for us, ready to shoot like they did with Daniel, splattering what used to be his body on the walls, clouding Dana's sight. 

We turned to run, but a large sectarian grabbed Dana by the neck, screaming as if his vocal cords were being torn apart, grabbing her hair and stripping the skin from top to bottom while drowning in her own screams. Hector tried to rescue her, but I stopped him, taking him to a part of the kitchen where we could hide, not caring about the noise, as the echoes of those screams from the diners were reverberating through the place. 

We found an opening between work tables to hide the three of us. What do they want? I only know that now my brother is coming for me; I really didn't know what was happening in his life as he was very absent. Those figures that adorned his room years ago started to make some sense, a strange hexagon with what appeared to be a star in the center. He must be the leader of all this. I tried to understand the situation, letting each thought descend from my head like the red liquid flowing from Skyler's eyes that were pierced by two long knives. Hector and I ran away, which ended up being a mistake as we fell into a trap they had set, catching Hector and pushing him into a burning fryer, submerging his face causing smoke and bubbles to rise. 

The sectarians were coming for me; one tried to intercept me from behind, so I hit him with my elbow, making him step back. I then grabbed his arm and threw him to the ground, rolling to deliver a punch to another sectarian. I picked up a knife to defend myself, but I noticed that those people lowered their weapons and only aimed at me, slowly approaching me. Just before being knocked out and everything going dark physically, I found myself in this apparently dreamlike world, where I am seeing myself making a decision that would make me successful in my work, but I'm seeing it from my brother's perspective. 

I didn't know that decision would also change his life, giving birth to a darkness that I could describe as envy. You're my brother, you were supposed to be proud and happy for me, what did I get in return? Your damn hatred unleashed on me. I was surely not the only precursor of that darkness; I regret not protecting you from it, but I simply didn't know, we didn't communicate so much, we didn't know how to.

I woke up and found myself tied to a chair, being watched by my brother, and before I could say a word, he said, "I can achieve great things, too." He and the sectarians began to gather near a wall, forming ovations and bowing to a large golden suit of armor with huge wings extending beyond a towering helmet from which strange proportions resembling horns emerged. They were screaming and crying with happiness at the sight of that thing before them, euphorically chanting its name, "Metatron, Metatron, Metatron." 

Now I understand. To his eyes, I was the most powerful, and my brother felt he was just behind me in terms of power. But I still couldn't understand why he was doing all this. Is envy towards your brother strong enough to cause all this chaos? I don't think so. From Metatron's hand appeared a giant sword that began to pierce each of the sectarians, including my brother, moving me from side to side to escape this place. I managed to untie myself and ran for my life, but before reaching the exit, Metatron blocked my way, threatening me with that giant sword. 

I know what I am to you, my brother; you saw my presence in your life as a god, a being stronger than you, and you only felt like you were second in command. I was the older brother; I should have protected you and done things better, but there is no justification for all the evil you have committed. With that gaze fixed on me, Metatron sheathed his sword. I don't know what he "thought," but he simply vanished. I looked around and it was chaos; I left the restaurant, walking aimlessly down the street. How am I going to explain this to the police? They won't believe me. I shouldn't have accepted the invitation to dinner here, but it had been so long since I saw my friends.
