I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place sure to never get any business. No human business, that is.  Yeah, the shop vanished. I'll get to that in a second. Laura is still a fly (if you didn't catch that update, go[ here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/zoshjn/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), we are trying to get that one sorted out. Oh, and I met a banshee a few days back (I think). In short, a lot of weird stuff happens. If you want to get caught up, or start at the beginning, then go ahead and check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) out.

\--------------------------------------

Yeah, I know we are super late, but I guess Selene was feeling festive because she asked me to come to the store early and help set up Christmas lights and all that. It wasn't really anything special, just some colored lights, and we finished pretty early. With a half hour to burn, we sat and talked next to her car. Nothing important, just about the weird stuff we both deal with at the Drowsy Spectre. She is a bit goofy but I like it honestly. Having some normal weirdness in the face of deadly weirdness is refreshing. Amber kept glancing my way as she unloaded her car, I think it was jealousy. She wanted to talk to me, likely to convince me to buy some candles.

On Monday, however, we came in and the lights were gone. Well, more than the lights. The Drowsy Spectre wasn't there. In its place was a larger building, one with a big sign that read "Headsman's." When I pulled into the parking lot I instantly noted the change. I had gotten there about five minutes before opening to find both Selene and Amber standing outside Headsman's, both staring up at the sign with their hands in their hair.

They didn't note my approach, nor did they say anything when I got out of my car. I approached. "So...?" I didn't really know what to ask.

"Shop's gone." That much was obvious.

Amber pulled hard at her hair. "Where am I going to sell candles?!"

"Out here?" I offered.

Selene noted my indifference. "All our work is gone! All the lights, the two hours we slaved away out here are a complete waste!"

She was more upset about the lights than the entire store being gone. "What do we do?"

"Open on time."

"But that isn't a café."

Selene dropped her arms. "It isn't... always."

That didn't make any sense. Then again, nothing really did. "So it just changes sometimes?"

"Yeah. Very rarely."

"Is it always a..." I looked up, not sure what exactly it was at the time. "Entertainment center? Redneck Chuck E Cheese?"

"Not always. It was a shoe store a long time ago."

I didn't want to work at a shoe store *or* a Chuck E Cheese. "Does it change back or is this permanent?"

"No, no. It'll be back tomorrow. These things last one day and we have no idea what causes it. Different rules, different customers, different products entirely. A complete curveball for everyone here."

Em and Barrow pulled in at the same time, followed by John (we still haven't replaced Keith and John's been taking his shifts). When Em exited her car, she kicked her tire really hard. "I f'ing HATE these places!"

As expected, Barrow didn't really react. "Huh. That is worse than the shoe store."

I was sort of curious about why a shoe store was a problem. It sounded a lot easier than food service. "So how do we figure out the new rules?"

Selene shrugged. "Learn as you go. There might be a note in there from whoever worked last."

"What do you mean?"

"We aren't the only place like this. The coffee shop is out there somewhere, being worked by another set of employees that are probably thanking us for our extensive rule set. A *long* time ago, before the pixie and Hook, it was a radio station for a day. I did *not* like that."

"Do we still have to follow our rules?"

"Yeah, assuming the cryptid that they reference is around." She gestured at Amber. "Like her. No candles."

"Oh, come on, Selene. Just one? You know how this is going to hurt my business."

Selene sneered at her and approached the door. "Alright everyone. Let's hunt down the rule book. If there isn't one, then we are screwed. Well, we are screwed anyway because we don't have the staff for this business. We have to learn as we go." She turned the lock and opened the door. "Don't die please. I am growing fond of ya'll."

When we stepped inside, we were hit with a stench. Bits of food were scattered all over the place. I think it was pepperoni I stepped on, then a whole slice of pizza under a nearby bar stool. An entire basket of fries were scattered underneath a booth. The entire place was an absolute mess, sure not to pass any inspection that might come its way. Carpet was torn in some corners, a ceiling panel was hanging from, well, the ceiling, and I saw mold on the walls. Speaking of the walls, they were an insanely ugly shade of green and orange. Whoever designed this would be great meat for Tall Ben (I was told making jokes about it would help ease trauma with the giant, so don't be surprised). This was an entertainment restaurant, and not a good one.

So, you know how Chuck E Cheese's has that mouse smiling on the logo? Instead, Headsman's had a wolf in an executioner mask, an ax in one hand and a thumbs up with the other. Blood covered the axe and he was chopping the 'H' in two.

"This place sucks." Em covered her arms, then shivered. She put back on her jacket. "There is no heating!"

"Found it!" Selene shouted, coming up from behind the front counter. "It is a thick one!" She slammed a large binder down, revealing the title 'Rules for not dying! PLEASE READ!' Not dying sounded nice. "Let's see here. Table of Contents, lots of references to different customers. That'll be good. There is a general rule page, good!" Looking up at her four employees, she made sure we were ready. "Okay y'all, listen up. Here's the rules.

1. Close curtains before 8:00pm! Open curtains again at 9:00pm. No exceptions.
2. Do not clean anything! If the characters do not get to eat their scraps, they will eat the customers or us instead.
3. All lights must be turned off at 10:00pm. There is a master switch in the back of the kitchen. Make sure everyone is in a good hiding place and set a timer for ten minutes. Shut off the lights and hide. Please make sure one of you has a way to tell time. You can turn back on the lights at 11:00pm.
4. At 12:00am, close up shop. Everyone needs to take the elevator to the basement floor. It takes a few minutes. If the elevator doesn't open but starts slowing down, climb out the vent on top as fast as possible. Surviving is up to you after that. The elevator will keep going down and getting to safety depends on how soon you recognize the issue.
5. If customers didn't make enough of a mess in the main lobby, the machines would be hungry. On the basement floor, you will be safe for an hour or two depending on how much there is to eat upstairs. This is survival for you; stay alive until the sun comes up.
6. If you hear "I'm the Headsman!" then you are in trouble, don't make any noise.
7. The Plague Rat wears a doctor's mask; when it is near, you will feel an overwhelming urge to sneeze. Don't.
8. Hungry Piglet will make your stomach grumble and it *will* hear. Keep moving and pray you don't run into another machine.
9. There are windows that go nowhere. When they light up, smash one and you'll be in a closet in the woods. Follow the morning sun to get back to the parking lot. That is it for the day you are done. Go home and *do not* stick around.

"Weird." Selene lifted her head. "I wonder how many of these we will have to follow."

"All of them?" I replied, not wanting to get grinded up by some fuzzy machine. "That is why they are called rules."

"Where is the kitchen?" John sighed. "Y'all can deal with this. I'm sure kitchen has a different set of rules."

Did our kitchen have different rules? "Wait, do you have a different list than us?"

"Yeah. Well, technically both."

Huh. I would have to make sure Richard and Selene knew that I had no interest in working in the kitchen seeing as it would just add more chances for me to be killed horribly. Everything went without an issue for the first few hours. An animatronic show played for the sparse customers that came in. Mostly children, ones that did not look normal at all. Black eyes stared back at me from one corner, whispers to come join them at the playground. Large tunnels intersected and led to slides where more black-eyed kids stared. I politely declined with a shake of my head, but they didn't seem to care. I brought pizza to what I think was a zombified... seven, maybe eight year old? It growled at me when I handed it its plate.

Arcade machines blared, the animatronics sang and spun, kids screamed nonsense; there really wasn't much work to be done, aside from delivering the worst of junk food to any table that dared try it. Surely even supernatural families would be harmed by the incredibly edible trash I was serving but no one seemed to care. A lot (and I mean a *lot*) of scraps got thrown on the floor. Entire plates, baskets of fries, slices of pizza. If Rule 5 was determined by how much food fell on the floor, we would be safe for most of the night.

Things started picking up when 8:00pm came around. Shortly before it was time to close the curtains to the machine's stage, a familiar face walked through the door.

"Dr. Fields?" I was more than a bit surprised. "What are you doing here?"

"Who?" He asked, his brows meeting.

"You. You're Dr. Fields, right? You came to the Drowsy Spectre a few weeks ago."

"Oh..." For a moment, he considered this. "I don't seem to remember anything at all. Who are you?"

Names were dangerous in this type of place, so I was careful. "What *do* you remember, doctor? Anything about the café? What about Bilgoth?"

"Who?"

This wasn't good. "Hey Barrow?" I got his attention. "This is Dr. Fields, right? I'm not crazy?"

"What happened to him? He doesn't... feel the same."

"Feel?"

Barrow shrugged. "Yeah. Not the same."

I thought he couldn't feel. That was my guess, considering his lack of reaction to anything. It seemed Barrow was more complicated than that. "He doesn't know any of us, he doesn't even know who he is. Watch." I turned back to Fields. "Hey, what is your name?"

He stared at us. "I... I don't know. Why don't I know?"

"Do you remember anything?" Barrow repeated my question from earlier.

Dr. Fields (I am like 75% certain it is the same guy) shook his head. "I... don't know." That must be his favorite answer.

"Why did you come here, then?"

"It just felt like there might be answers here, but this doesn't spark any memories."

I sighed. "Well this isn't the same place right now. If you come back tomorrow, it might be a bit more familiar. Turned into an Entertainment Center today. Big surprise to all of us."

"The café turned into... this?"

"So you *do* remember the café!"

"No, you mentioned it."

"Oh, right." I checked my watch. "Hey, it is two minutes till 8:00! Get the curtains." Em was on it. The machines kept on dancing through the boos as Em closed the heavy curtains, drowning the animatronics in darkness. That entire hour was full of children and adults begging, threatening, and pleading for us to open the curtains and restore the show. I am certain that we'd all die if we opened those curtains, else there wouldn't be a rule, so we remained firm with our no's even when things got a bit violent. Never violent towards us, but a few customers did throw hands with each other. Were we supposed to clean blood out of the carpet, or leave all messes? Who knows.

9:00pm rolled around and we failed to open the curtains. Things were really weird, okay? Everything was new. Old customers came in, so we had to figure out how to please them in the new place. New customers that we didn't know. We got so caught up in everything that we didn't see the clock at 9:00pm. When it did, the machines decided to come out and pay everyone a visit. By visit, I mean they were hungry.

Someone screamed. It wasn't even a normal person, it was some sort of pale child with red eyes. The large rat slowly placed the struggling cryptid into its belly. Meat grinders tore the boy to shreds, cutting off the first scream as it consumed an arm and quickly the rest of the body. The rat quickly moved to its next victim. We needed to do something.

Em was in charge of the curtains, as decided by drawing a lot, and so she was standing close to the stage when everything went down. She tried to get a kid out of the way, but only caused one of the adults to get grabbed. I think it was actually the large fly with a human face. He wasn't fast enough, which was odd for a fly I guess, and quickly met his end in the maw of the animatronic.

It spotted Em and moved far too quickly to grab her. Even as she tried to leap over the counter to safety, I was hurrying to her aid. Barrow and I met her just as the Plague Rat grabbed her legs. She sneezed.

"Don't let it get me, Barrow!" She screamed, flailing as the machine leaned back with its full weight to pull her away. "Please, please! Feel something! Don't let me die!"

Barrow didn't say anything, he just pulled. I planted my feet against the counter so that I was standing sideways, but the machine was so strong that I worried we would pull Em's arms from their sockets. She began to cry, sob, to scream.

"I'm sorry, Axel!" She whimpered. "Please, I am sorry! Don't let it eat me!"

She was talking about the pet thing. I would not let her die, certainly not for that! But I wasn't strong enough and I could feel the machine winning. I could also see a face peeking from the darkness behind the stage, one with yellow eyes. More machines waiting for their turn. What was keeping them?

With a roar I pulled hard on Em's arms and heard the slightest pop, which brought out a yelp from Em. She was going to die or be pulled apart, neither would get her to safety. The animatronic started to push itself forward while continuing to pull back, bringing the sharp gears in its chest closer and closer.

It reached her foot and there was nothing we could do to stop it.

Blood splattered across the floor, bone was shattered like wood in a stump grinder. She screamed so greatly that I had a new fire in my gut, one that brought more vigor to each pull I made to save her. I couldn't go further, however, not without breaking her. "Selene!" I shouted, out of ideas. She was being eaten alive.

The machine was working up to her ankle and her eyes fluttered. "Selene, dammit! SELENE!"

Finally she came out from the kitchen, eyes landing on the massacre. How could she not hear what was going on? She rushed up to grab a hold of Em, but quickly realized the same thing I did; we would split her in two. She moved around the counter, hesitated for only a moment, then stuck out her hand towards the machine.

She uttered the same language as she had with Laura. *"is'livuri!!"* When the word left her mouth, the machine began to shake. Trembling further, its strength began to fail and we were able to pull Em and her mangled limb from the mouth of the metal rat.

It shook and wobbled as if it were an aging engine, then it fell apart. Screws toppled to the floor, metal plates and cogs clanged as they stuck eachother. The machine was on the carpet, in its basic components, completely harmless. I was not going to wait for another to exit the curtains, not when I saw Selene toppled to the ground, white as a ghost.

Barrow laid Em down while I threw open the curtains to the stage. Instantly the remaining machines began to dance and sing, but there was no audience. The hungry Plague Rat saw to that. But... but the rat was on the stage, eyes locked on to me. It danced as it always had, but there was an anger in its eyes. A lust for blood. I turned around and saw all the parts still on the floor. This was not a fight we would win, not even if Selene could tear them each to pieces; they would come back.

Em was in a bad way. Her foot was crushed into nothing, but still attached. It looked more like a large finger than a foot, though. Even if it was nursed back to health, it would be completely useless. She was breathing, though, and Barrow tightened the limb to stop her from bleeding. Selene was on her feet, but very weak.

"I said don't die." Her voice was weak. The counter was the only reason she could stand. "Dammit, it is... it is going to be a long night. How is she?"

"Alive. She will recover." Barrow answered. "The foot, I don't know."

I had to use the bathroom, nearly having soiled myself during the machine's attack. When I exited the stall, I was met with my reflection. Only, it wasn't mine. A man in a suit stood on the other end. The head wasn't human, though. It was that of a goat, horns half as long as my arms curving up into the air. He wore a necklace with a familiar pendant; an upside down triangle with a cross through it.

It was Rykar's necklace. "Hey there, kid." That was Rykar's voice too. His eyes, which were human despite the goat's head, burned like a yellow fire. "We never got properly introduced. I am Anistor Rykar. Lord Rykar, to you."

"Aren't names dangerous to share?"

He smiled. "My name already belongs to another. What do you know of the Pillar King?"

From the way Selene reacted, I knew it was nothing good. "A customer mentioned him."

"A woman without eyes?" How did he know that? "You saw her, then? Gooood." Lord Rykar grinned. "Very good. Tell me, what did she call you, Axel?" He stepped closer towards the mirror. "Did she name you Fatewriter?"

I didn't answer, which seemed to frustrate him slightly. "Allow me to let you in on a little secret, Axel. Two of your friends will die here tonight. You want to know why? That rule list in there isn't up to date. The store's manager took the current one home. Some rules are going to be broken, some bones crushed by hungry metal gears. That doesn't sound like fun for the staff, right?"

"What do you want?"

"What do *we* want? You don't want your new friends to die, I don't want this place here at all. I prefer the café, you see." Lord Anistor Rykar stuck out a hand and, much like before, it burned with a golden light. "Strike a deal, no tricks. I'll get the store back for you immediately. You'll walk out of the bathroom doors and be back at the café, safe and sound. Well, mostly safe. All *you* have to do is get me Selene's real name."

I wasn't going to do that. "I wouldn't betray her."

"Oh Axel, come on now! You're smart! Would it really be betrayal to save two lives?! One might even be hers, right?" That was true. Besides, what was to stop me from breaking my end of the deal? "Oh, and one other small detail. Decide to not uphold your side of the deal, and you'll be my thrall, much like dear Dan."

Well I guess that wasn't a plan. "Maybe we all survive tonight."

The lights died, Rykar's eyes exploded, and all things but him disappeared entirely. We existed in a void, one that was his entirely. "And any that survive will meet my ire. I will skin alive Em the Pixie and drape it over your shoulders, I will tear Barrow's heart from his chest and feed it to you myself! Ricky may have the stomach to resist my will, but you do not!"

If a deal came with a threat, did it really count? "Wait, you can't force me to make a deal. That wouldn't be fair, you aren't giving me a choice."

Apparently I wasn't able to call his bluff, if there was one. "Would you like to find out?"

If there was even a chance Rykar was right, then I needed to make the deal. I could figure out how to wiggle from the contract afterwards, but all that mattered in the moment was ensuring that no one died that night. I don't think Rykar can lie; I was reading that most supernatural creatures have to be honest in their dealings, even if they twist the truth. He was pretty plain in his wording; two of your friends will die here tonight. Em was already injured, Selene wasn't in a good place, and we already discovered we didn't stand a chance against the machines. I had one question I could ask Tall Ben, he would have to give me the answer.

I would make the deal and ask him how to break it.

The mirror was gone, there were no barriers, physical or otherwise, to bar us from shaking hands. I reached out and took Lord Rykar's burning palm. He squeezed my hand tight and shook it once, then the bathroom returned. I was back at the Drowsy Spectre, my hand near our bathroom's mirror. On the other side stood Rykar, still goat-headed like before. He had a candle in his hand, the same one that I shook. It was burning, the wax melted quickly down and around his fingers.

"Nice doing business with you, Axel White. Oh, and one more thing-" He held out a little bottle of purple liquid. "I need Selene alive. Give her this." With that, he dissolved into me. I realized that my reflection was now my own.

Then came the screeching. It was so loud that I fell to the floor, hands covering my ears but failing to bring me any relief at all. I shoved myself out the bathroom door to see Heartmin at the front counter, assaulting Barrow with her voice. His eyes rolled into his head, but he kept upright as he stumbled towards the kitchen. When I first started, Barrow said we could just cover our ears and we'd be fine. I thought the sound would kill me!

Tom was there. Fucking Tom, with his camera. He was trying to take pictures of someone behind the counter. I pressed my hands against my ears and pushed towards the bar. Tall Ben was watching from the drive thru window, but I paid him no mind. Barrow came back from the kitchen, forcing himself towards Heartmin. He had a plate in his hand, which meant his ears were opened to the assault of sound. As soon as he reached her, however, she shut her mouth and took his offering.

"Thank you."

His eyes returned to normal. "S-sorry about your wait." Barrow whispered.

She turned and left the store, but my ears were still ringing. Em stood from behind the counter and leaned against the front register. She was conscious, which was obviously a good thing. When she drew a deep breath, color returned to her face. Damn, she even smiled and laughed a little when she saw both of us.

"Glad that place is gone."

Then the sound of a shutter went off, along with a flash of light. Em fell to the ground.

Barrow and I ran to her side quickly, finding her eyes had gone completely white. Tom giggled as he hurried out the door, disappearing into the night. I shook Em, but there was no response. Desperate, I touched the wound on her foot hoping she would react. Nothing.

"Wake up!" I shouted, but Barrow gave up. He was just staring at her. "Don't do this. Don't do her like you did Keith!"

He sighed. "I am trying!"

"TRY HARDER!" I splashed water on Em's face. "Where is Selene?!"

"I don't know." Barrow lost all drive. "I don't know. I can't pretend anymore. Em's gone."

She wasn't breathing, but she still had color. "No, she isn't dead. She isn't. There has to be a way!"

There was. A face still watched from the drive thru window. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and marched towards the drive thru. Tall Ben stared at Em's still body.

"She okay?"

"No, she isn't!" I shouted at the big face. "You owe me an answer!"

"I do." He nodded. "You want to ask me a question?"

I would lose my only chance to get out of a deal that would force me to betray Selene. Either let Em's soul fade away, trapped in Tom's camera, or consign myself to betray Selene one day. I wanted to throw up, as if my stomach could expel the decision from my body. I knew there wasn't really an option, so I asked my question.

I had to be careful. The only way to save Em would be to find Tom and force him to give back her soul, or whatever he took from her. "Where does Tom go?"

"After his camera? Good idea. Give me two days and I will light a fire where he lives. Does that suffice?"

"It does." I closed the window on Tall Ben and returned to Barrow and Em. There was nothing more to do, so I searched for Selene. She was in her office, pale as a ghost, too weak to stand. I brought her the purple bottle. "Take this."

"Where..." She was out of breath. "Where did you find that?"

"In the bathroom." That wasn't a total lie.

Despite her suspicion, Selene drank the potion. Suddenly her breathing was easier, but she was not fully restored. "What happened? How did we get back here?"

"I don't know." I lied. "Tom got a picture of Em. I am going after him."

"What? Now?" She sat up. "You can't do that. You'll die in the woods!"

"I have time to figure that out. Two days. We need to figure out how to improve that necklace. Either way, I am going after Tom. I want your help."

"I can't go there. I physically can't."

Then I would have to do something else. I am home now. Richard had to close the store without Em, seeing as he needs a pixie (or something like her) to run the store properly. This was all yesterday, which means I go into the woods tomorrow. Selene said she might have a way to extend the protection of the necklace, but she couldn't promise anything. What lesson do I have tonight? Do anything for your friends because, if you're like me, they are all you have.
