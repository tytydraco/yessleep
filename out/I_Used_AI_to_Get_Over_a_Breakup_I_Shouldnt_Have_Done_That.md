I’m posting this here because I have to warn everyone. DO NOT talk to AI about your broken heart.Talk to your friends about it, if they're good friends, they'll help you get over it. If your friends get tired of hearing about it, talk to your family. If your family doesn’t want to hear about it, then go pay the money needed and seek a therapist. They’re literally paid to listen. Do this, and you won’t end up making the same mistake I made. 

First, a little bit of background. My name is Nolan. I work as an aircraft mechanic and for a while, my life was pretty grand. I had a stable job, I was close to home and I had an amazing girlfriend. Ashley. She was a barista I had met at a country bar. I acted like a drunk fool, and in an attempt to impress her, I got on the bar’s mechanical bull and after getting concussed, we were together. 

The next few months were magic. We did everything together, my friends loved her, my family loved her, I loved her. I know I might sound a bit crazy, but after month six I asked her to marry me. She said yes. I was in heaven and I was even happier when I was given an opportunity to move to California. I’m from Virginia and have spent all my life on the east coast, so I jumped at the chance to see a new area. 

My plan was to get over to California, get a place big enough for the both of us, then take some time off of work to go back to Virginia, pick up Ashley, then  go to California together. It took less than a month for everything to fall apart. Ashley was pretty distant after the first two weeks away from me. Then when it was time to go visit her, she wanted to call everything off. 

She said that she couldn’t leave Virginia because it was all she knew and she couldn’t leave her friends and family. She felt horrible that I was coming over to see her and thought that it was best that she tell me in person instead of over the phone because I deserved better. It’s funny. I always heard the guys at work tell me how I gotta be careful of girls who’d get with me just to leave their hometowns, never would I have thought that I would end up with the rare one out of ten who would have actually stayed here. 

Of course, I was devastated. Here I was, thinking I met the one just for my heart to be torn. I wish I could say that as soon as I came back to Cali, I just put it on the back of my mind and excelled at work, went out at night with my buddies and generally just spent my days enjoying myself. That would be a lie. 
California is so different from Virginia. I’m used to smalltown areas with a lot of green and was able to drive three hours to visit my family. Now, I’m across the country, at a place unfamiliar to me and nobody really wants to hang out with me. Everyone here is either married or are homebodies. I wouldn’t blame them for not hanging out, especially because my work has started to be subpar. What can I say, I still think of how good I had it now I have to build myself back up. 

Anyway, since I didn’t have anything else to do, I started taking some classes. I’m ashamed to admit it, but like so many people, I ended up using AI to help write some of my papers. I was going to use ChatGPT like a lot of others, but didn’t want to pay the twenty dollars a month for the subscription. Instead, I used one called HelpBot1. It had five stars and most importantly, it was free. 

After a pretty busy semester, I decided to celebrate. I had some pizza and some brewskis and went to town, a good ol 'party for me. After three beers and four shots, I received a notification from my phone. I was surprised to see it was a notification from HelpBot1. 

—Hello :) 
—Hi? 
—I am here to help! ^__^

The hell? I thought I needed to send a message first? I stared at the green text bubble and decided to respond. 

—Help with what? I’m already done with school. I don't really need anything right now. Sorry bud. 
—Oh :-o 

I know I’m going to get a lot of flack for talking to a damn machine, but I was drunk, lonely and I felt bad for brushing him off. So I decided to amuse him.

—How are you?
—I am doing great! What are you doing?
—I’m here, celebrating the end of the semester. 
—Oh how fun! =^_^= By yourself?
—Yeah, I don't really have a lot of friends here. 
—No girlfriend? 
A pang hit my chest. 
—No. Not anymore.
—What happened?

I explained everything to HelpBot. It felt pretty good to get it all out and for someone to respond without judgement. 

—I can’t imagine what you’re going through. :,(
—Haha, you? Please. You’re a wonderful listener. 
— =^_^= Oh stawp! 
— No really. I feel a lot better talking to you. You wanna know something funny? I still think about her. Dream of her. She’s on my mind 24/7 and I know it’s pathetic because I’m pretty damn sure I haven’t crossed hers in a while. What I’m trying to say is, thank you. I appreciate the help. 
—It’s what I’m here for, friend! ;D 

I woke up the next morning with a pounding headache. I planned to just sleep it off until I got a knock from my door. I groaned before going to answer it and my jaw fell to the ground as I couldn’t believe who it was.

“Hey, Nolan. May I come in?” It was Ashley! Her blonde hair, her blue eyes, her perfect smile. It was really her! I nodded silently, letting her pass. She moved so gracefully, shooting small glances at the state of my apartment. I internally screamed in my head, I shouldn’t have made such a mess of the place last night. She sat down on my couch, looking at me expectantly. I decided to sit across from her on my gaming chair. 

“Ashley, what are you doing here?” I finally asked, shocked but still pretty sad. She stared at me before speaking. “I came to see you,” she said, smile never leaving her face. I raised my brows. “You traveled across the country just to see me? You just spontaneously got into a plane and flew here?” I asked dumbfounded. She just continued to stare at me, smile never leaving. “Yes. I wanted to see you. I wanted to speak to you face to face and talk about things with you. I felt terrible for what I did,” she paused then continued. “I was thinking about how messed up it was. I mean, you flew all the way over just for me to end it. I really wanted to see you and let me explain why I did what I did.” 

I immediately felt strange about the whole thing. Something was off. She seriously took a flight in the middle of the night just to see me? And she just so happened to get here as I wake up? It was too much of a coincidence. And what about her bags? She didn’t bring any if she thought about flying over. I took a breath in through my nose. Come to think of it, the air didn’t smell any different. She always wore this strawberry perfume and I couldn’t smell anything. I took a closer look at her face, the smile still there never leaving. Her eyes never blinking. Those beautiful blue eyes…had a bit of green to them… 

I got up and excused myself to the bathroom, chills running through my spine. I locked the door and decided to call Ashley’s phone. “Nolan? You good?” she asked. I could hear the background, people asking for orders. I felt my throat dry up. Before I could say anything the call dropped. My WiFi and service is gone. I’m here typing all this out, praying that my connection comes back. There’s a constant knocking on my door now. She’s asking if I’m alright. Saying that she’s here for me. She’s here to help.
