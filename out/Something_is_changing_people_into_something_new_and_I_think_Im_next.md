 

I won’t be me for much longer.

The last person I heard say these words became something more than a man, but much less than human. 

I don’t want to end up like him, and I want people to know what I found before I’m gone.

It’s watching me as I type this, so I know my time is short.

I’ve never expected or wanted much from my life. Just a job that didn’t take more than it gave, someone to hold at night, and a good cold beer before bed.

But I saw something that stripped my soul down to the bone and smothered any joy and hope I once had for this world. 

Now I don’t sleep anymore. Not since I learned that something is snatching people in broad daylight and changing them. Trying to make them better, something new.

The changed ones.

They are much quieter now, and they look more like people than they used to. It’s only getting better at making them, and soon we won’t be able to tell them from us.

For a while, I thought I got away and earned the right to enjoy the scraps of a normal life left after everything that happened. 

But then I saw one of them the other day, and I remembered when I first saw one of the changed ones. His name was Luke, and I was alone with him late into that hot summer night while he spoke of when he was still a man.

No amount of alcohol can silence his cries that still ring in my mind. The sounds of when he finally understood that help was never coming. When the dead man told me his story.

I’m writing this because I saw one of the changed ones a few days ago when I stopped at a convenience store to grab something quick for a late dinner. 

As I pulled a pizza out of a freezer, an old lady shuffled up beside me and stared blankly into the glass door. Her hands swung loosely at her sides as she stood otherwise frozen in place. 

The pizza I held shook as the familiar sickly smell of rotting flesh and oily components mixed with the cold freezer air that sent whips of cold fog around us. 

 A soft whine of small servos whirred as she turned her head to me. Her eyes were bloodshot, and tears streaked down her face as she tried to smile. Her lips pulled back over her teeth, exposing black gums and congealed blood.

“Please, kill me,” she whispered through clenched teeth.

 Her jaw popped and fell to the floor.  A putrid grey tongue lolled down her throat, and two blinking lights flashed from the back of her throat. She was another improvement, another attempt to make us perfect. 

I dropped the pizza, shattering it on the floor as I ran. She still had vocal cords, unlike most of them. 

She screamed for me to run as she chased me. If I hadn’t parked my car on the curb with the driver's door facing the store, I probably wouldn’t be writing this. 

Something is happening, and no one will believe me.

Something much worse than I had originally thought. I wanted to forget what I’d seen. The creations of an inhuman mind gone insane. 

Anyway, best to start where it started.

Everything changed last year when I was on night duty for the Claysville police. It was supposed to be a simple job, and it was for a while. 

Claysville is a very small Kentucky river town, and it has a population of just three hundred and four. 

Small towns are the best place for monsters to hide, things that need to learn and grow. Things not yet ready for the world to see them. 

My night started with the typical shift change, with Gary giving me the rundown on open issues. He tossed the keys to the cruiser at me as he walked past my desk.

“Good luck tending to the veggie patch tonight,” he laughed as he left through the door. 

He always said this on a full moon. It had gotten old, but still usually held true. With it being the weekend, and the fact that Claysville had more bars and liquor stores than grocery, the night was certain to bring out a variety of crazies.  

 I was sitting at my desk while tossing sunflower seeds into a Styrofoam cup as the wall clock buzzed. 

 My mind kept returning to last night’s terrible date and the sound of each seed hitting the cup grounded me to the present just enough not to spiral. 

 I had finally gotten a date with Valerie, and when I struggled to find something to talk about, I bombed fast and hard. 

My desk phone lit up and shrieked as a call came in. I reached for the handset and sighed as I readied myself for my first call of the night. 

Domestic disturbance, car accident, or one of Gary’s veggie patch crazies. It was past two a.m., on a Saturday, and a hot September night at that. People got wild on nights like this.

“Claysville Police, this is Officer Murphy.” 

“I uh, this is Jake Towner and, uh, I need help here, officer,” The voice gagged and retched on the phone before continuing. “I think he’s dead. But he’s not a man. I don’t know what this is.”

I tensed. It was fifty-fifty. He was either drunk or crazy, or… this was a legitimate dead body discovery. 

“Let’s take it back a bit, sir, tell me what happened.”

“I woke up just a few minutes ago to hear my chickens screaming outside, so I thought it was a possum or something. I grabbed my 12-gauge and boots to check it out. There was a man at the coop trying to get in.”

Jake’s breath came across the phone in a ragged panting.

“I saw his face and… his eyes…. I shot him. I think he’s dead.” His voice whimpered like a fifty-year-old child. He sounded afraid. 

This had evolved into a shooting. Maybe even a homicide.

“Where are you?” I asked.

“Old Crawford Farm. He’s like a man, but he has machinery inside his body.” 

This call had been a hard read up until this point. Just another balls-to-the-wall lunatic, I thought.  But I had to check it out. 

It would be safer to assume this guy was dangerous, rather than not.

“Where’s the gun now?” 

“In my hand.” 

“I need you to place that gun on the ground, with the barrel facing away from you. Step away from it. You’ll need to keep your hands above your head when we arrive and make no sudden movements. Do you understand?”

“Yes, sir.”

“We’re on our way. Wait there.”

I keyed up my radio.

“I have a possible 131 at the Crawford farm. Requesting EMS and backup. I am heading there, expected ETA ten minutes.”

This was standard operating procedure, but I knew that Claysville’s only other officer was at the other end of the county. Probably facedown, drunk as a skunk at Tater’s bar. 

 I was speaking to no one, and I would be alone until the ambulance arrived. With how far out the Maysville hospital was, that would likely be at least an hour.

I slid on my cap and ran to my cruiser.

Long-reaching branches flew past the open windows of my car as I raced down a dark, winding back road. I glanced up at the full moon and shook my head while a bitter laugh escaped me.  

It was beaming down bright rays of lunar influence, and I wondered just how crazy it would get before the night was over.

A cluster of old cars and trucks was piled up at the entrance of the long driveway that led back to the farm. It was fully blocked. I’d have to walk. 

The vehicles were stripped down to little more than bare frames. Only seats, glass, and empty cans remained.

I tilted my head to my shoulder mic and opened the channel. 

“This is Officer Murphy. I have several vehicles blocking the entrance to the farm. I’m proceeding on foot; be advised that you’ll need to do the same.”

They didn’t reply. I tried again. Nothing.

I started my walk to the farm and heard the faint sputter of a small weed trimmer or chainsaw screaming in the night on some distant hill. 

A feeling of unease came over me as I realized that this was not a sound one typically hears at night. 

The old Crawford farm had one of those houses that almost everyone knew in Claysville. It’s where the R Farm Pumpkin Fest is held every year. 

It felt strange to be walking toward the barn where I had played as a child during school trips. That was before I started handling druggies, speeders, and dead bodies for a living.

The last dying breath of summer heat floated in the air as I approached the two figures. One standing, the other lying face down in the dirt. 

My fingers traced the butt of my gun as I kept my eyes on who I assumed was Jake. His hands were firmly in his pockets. Exactly where they shouldn’t be.

“Hands in the air. I’m going to need you to step back from the body. Where’s your gun?”

He grinned nervously at me and almost tripped as I barked the order. His hands shot up, and he nodded his head to a glinting object in the dirt.

A sweet rot mixed with motor oil hung heavy in the wind as I slowly approached the body. 

It was not a man. It was not a machine. It was something else.

 He wore soiled boxers and a shredded t-shirt.  Chunks of flesh had been torn from the limbs, with just white bones barely holding sections of him together.

 A mess of black cables snaked from the back of his head and down to his lower back, where a phone had been shoved into a festering hole carved into his flesh. 

His legs were caked with blood and shit, leading down to a pair of untied sneakers. 

It was when I noticed the maggots wiggling out of the sides of the underwear that I blew chunks. 

The mix of smell and sight was well beyond my limit. It was worse than when Mrs. Peffer died in her trailer during one of the hottest weeks last year. 

“Richard, I need you at the Crawford farm immediately.” I panted into my shoulder mic.

The phone embedded in the body dinged, and the limbs twitched once and hard, like the muscles of a science class bullfrog when you juice them up with some AC.

Or something testing circuits before powering up.

Another ding.

The head shot up and looked right at me. It had no eyes, only empty holes.  A webcam was screwed into his right shoulder. It stared at me as it blinked with a soft red light. 

I screamed and pulled my gun from the holster.

He’d been a man in his early twenties. Where he used to have flesh on his jaw, now it was just a skeletal frame that held a black, shriveled tongue within.  

The phone’s screen lit up, and an airy voice spoke from its small speaker.

“I’m recording this message…” A man’s voice said desperately.

The man lifted an arm and slammed it down hard onto the dirt as he pulled himself toward me. Gears turned under the stretched skin of his shoulder, and motors squealed.

“Don’t move!” My voice came out loud, but with an undercurrent that exposed my fear.

The jaw clicked as it moved, and a hissing sound came out like a death rattle that sprayed maggots onto its hands. The dark eye holes that led into brain matter looked up at me again.

“Screw this!” Jake stammered as he turned and ran into the woods.

A buzz came from the phone speaker.

“Message with the hopes that somebody believes…” 

He hissed again but did not charge me. Instead, he pointed to the phone on his back and wrote 0943 in the dirt. 

Looking back now, I know he wasn’t hissing.

 He was trying to scream.

“Please believe…” It said before yanking the cables from the back of its head.

He fell motionless to the ground, and the light on the webcam and phone remained on. 

The voice warbled out of the phone one final time. “I’m scared of what comes next. I know I won’t be me for much longer.”

The light faded from the camera, and the phone went dark. The sound of a small weed trimmer cut through the tree line where Jake had disappeared into. I tried my radio again but got no reply. I could try my car radio. It’s possible that my portable was broken. 

I kept glancing back as I half ran back to my car, keeping an eye on the machine man's body that should finally be dead. 

The hood of my car pointed open to the moon like a distracting finger. Most of the doors were open, and a tangle of wires hung loose from where the headlights had been just twenty minutes ago. It had been stripped just like the others. 

There was no radio. No houses for miles. I was alone until the ambulance got here. It could be hours.

I waited near the body for either Jake or the ambulance to show up. The skin of my hand was beginning to feel raw as I held the gun tightly in my sweaty hand. 

I found myself jumping at every twig snap and rustle of leaves. This night was more than my mind could handle. 

Biomechanical bodies, my car being stripped down, and now a growing dread that perhaps no one was coming. 

Or worse, that something was.

I jolted and fired a shot as a ding came from the body. The phone was lit up and displayed a smiling man hugging a massive German Shepherd on the lock screen.

The numbers in the dirt. It might be an unlock code. He wanted me to see something on his phone. 

I slipped on a glove and unlocked it. It had the voice recorder app up. Something told me to walk back to my car and leave this alone. To run back to town. Anything but press play.

But I was curious.

So, I pressed play.

His name was Luke, and he first saw one of these things when he was a boy. They were much cruder then. 

He knew what was behind all of this and why it was doing it. 

 

Somehow I’m still here.

I’ve been writing this for some time, and it has been reading everything I type with an alien indifference.  I think I might be safe for a little longer.

Maybe not.

But I’m going to take a walk.

Got to clear my head, and a drink might be just what I need. 

I’ll be back later to tell you more about what dead Luke said.
