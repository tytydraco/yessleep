We’d been trying for three years.

Ovulation kits. Temperature charts. Acupuncture. Sex reduced to numbers. Mara took herbs that made her nauseous and cut out caffeine like the internet said. I wore boxers and avoided hot baths. It all felt ridiculous. But when you want something badly enough, you’ll obey any superstition like gospel.

The hospital’s verdict came last spring.

Unexplained infertility, they called it—Mara’s ovaries *“unresponsive,”* her womb apparently *“inattentive,”* like her body had simply decided it wasn’t interested. I remember the look on her face when the consultant delivered the news: not shock, not grief—just a blank stillness, like something inside her had gone completely quiet.

She didn’t speak on the drive home. That night, she scrubbed the kitchen floor until her knuckles bled.

••

Weeks passed. I offered adoption. She said no.

Then she changed. Quietly at first. She stopped going to therapy. Stopped checking her cycle. But she started reading—books I’d never seen before. Old ones, with warped covers and titles in Gaelic or Latin. One was bound in hide. I asked where she found them. She just said, ***“I’m looking into older solutions.”***

She began following groups online. Forums, private servers, names like Womb-of-Stone and the Crooked Thorn. When I asked what they were, she shrugged. *“Traditional medicine. Pre-Christian fertility rites. Herbal stuff. Holistic.”*

But something in her tone sounded rehearsed. Like she was reading lines someone had given her.

That was around the time the symbols started showing up.

Not carved, not drawn—appearing. Chalk-white whorls on the bedroom mirror. A line of twisted twigs on our doorstep, bound in red thread. A small mound of dirt on the pillow between us when I woke. I accused her. She denied it, but I knew she was lying. She was pale all the time, feverish. Her skin took on a waxy sheen.

I found a leather folio under the bed. Inside were notes, copied by hand from something older. It referenced Celtic godforms I’d never heard of: Bríghach the Breeder, the Threefold Crown, and something called An Croílár Fiáin—*“the Wild Core.”*The pages spoke of hollow wombs as sacred space, vessels for something ancient and pre-human. The barren weren’t cursed, it said—they were chosen. Prepared.

I confronted her. She screamed at me for the first time in our marriage. ***“This isn’t your pain,”*** she said. ***“You don’t get to say no.”***

••

That night, I woke to find her standing in the attic, barefoot, bathed in moonlight.

***“There was a light,”*** she whispered. ***“It came through the ceiling. It saw me.”***

She said it like someone describing a religious experience. Her hands cradled her stomach. ***”It chose me.”***

I tried to pull her back down the stairs. Her skin was hot to the touch. She didn’t resist. She just kept smiling.

••

Three days later, she vomited blood.

A week after that, a test came back positive.

*Pregnant.*

Her face changed. Not softer, not relieved—reverent. She began painting again. Symbols, this time deliberately: three spirals joined at the center, deer skulls crowned with branches, a woman with no face giving birth to a burning star.

And the baby grew too fast. Six weeks in, she looked four months gone. Her eyes dimmed. She said the baby whispered during her dreams, not in words but images—crumbling hills, blood-fed roots, standing stones wrapped in skin.

When I suggested a hospital visit, she laughed. ***“They won’t see it. Not yet. It’s not for them.”***

••

Over the next few months I started hearing things.

Chanting under the floorboards. A scratching in the walls, like fingernails or hooves. Sometimes I’d see movement from the corner of my eye—too quick to be Mara, too deliberate to be rats. The lights began to flicker during dusk and stay dim even at full brightness. Our clocks stopped keeping time. The dog ran away and never came back.

Mara locked herself in the nursery. Painted a mural of a tree with limbs that ended in eyes.

At night, I heard her whisper:

***“I receive you. I receive you. I receive you.”***

⸻

She went into labor at 3:17 a.m.

No pain. No screaming. Just a low, guttural hum that seemed to come from somewhere deep beneath the house, resonating through her.

She called to me—calm, polite—asking for towels and water. Her belly was stretched taut like overripe fruit. Her skin had split in places, weeping clear fluid.

She gave birth on the nursery floor, surrounded by ash and salt.

The thing that came out was small. Limbs long, skin translucent and gray. Its mouth was sealed over with skin. Its eyes were black and searching—knowing.

And the moment I looked into them, I felt something open in me.

Like a trapdoor in my mind.

No voice. No words.

Just a single presence, entering without permission.

***“The womb was borrowed. You will be next.”***

••

I wanted to run. My body wouldn’t move.

It stared. I felt it reaching through me—mapping me.

And I understood, suddenly, what she’d meant. Mara hadn’t wanted a child. She wanted purpose. The cult had given her that. The rites had filled her. She hadn’t conceived—she’d been inhabited.

A vessel. A gate.

She lay back, her body already fading—bones hollow, eyes glassy, skin sinking inward like air leaving a suit.

She smiled once. And then collapsed like a broken tent.

••

I took the child. I don’t know why. Reflex. Pity. Or maybe it already owned me.

I laid it in the crib.

It never cried.

It just watched.

••

I don’t know how long I’ve been here.

Time doesn’t work properly anymore. The sun rises, but never moves. Shadows stretch in directions that make no sense.

Every door leads to the nursery.

The baby grows—not in size, but in presence. The house gets smaller, tighter, warmer. My bones ache in the mornings. My skin flakes in symmetrical patterns. My dreams are filled with circles and mouths.

I feed it when it lets me. It accepts food, but never chews. It absorbs. Consumes.

And it hums now.

Same tune Mara used to hum the night before the light came.

••

Last week, I found a message in the attic, carved deep into the floorboards beneath her prayer mat:

***“She was the beginning. You are the end.”***

I don’t sleep anymore. The walls pulse when I close my eyes. And sometimes I wake up and the baby is sitting upright in the crib, mouth still sealed, watching me with that impossible gaze.

Waiting.

••

Yesterday, I woke with something wrong in my gut.

Not pain. Not illness.

Movement.

Slow, patient pressure beneath the skin of my abdomen. As if something was rooting. Preparing.

There’s no doubt now. I’m the second gate.

And whatever comes next won’t need my permission.

It will walk.

••

*Because Mara was only the first.*

*And I prayed, too.*

*And it heard me.*
