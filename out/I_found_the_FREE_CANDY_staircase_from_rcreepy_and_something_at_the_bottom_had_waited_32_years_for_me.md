I have u/TucsonTank to thank for my ill-fated adventure. A week ago, this nameless, faceless Redditor posted [a picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/1fgoqwu/i_took_this_on_a_road_trip) from his road trip. And two days later, I saw it for myself. That’ll be the first and last time I dip my pinkie toe in the deceptive pool of urban exploring. Fuck him, and fuck *me* for pursuing something that shouldn’t have been pursued.

Something, it turned out, that was pursuing me.

Why didn’t I take up stamp-collecting like every other forty-year-old sad-sack wallowing in a mid-life crisis? Then I never would’ve looked for the ‘FREE CANDY’ staircase. And maybe it wouldn’t have ever found me.

Sorry, any stamp collectors out there. I didn’t mean to be rude. I’m envious of those who live the quiet life. My snarky, buffoonish sense of humour was born from trauma. I’ve been deflecting from my past for decades. Trying to outrun it. But even in those gentle lulls, that come from time to time, Hell is always waiting to resurface. And that was exactly what happened five days ago.

The anonymous poster told me the rough area in which he took the picture. I didn’t face a word of resistance, in spite of some voice, deep within my subconscious, *begging* for him not to tell me anything. It only took me a little research to find the building, and I immediately booked an overseas flight for the following day. I’m purposefully leaving place names out of this post, so don’t bother asking. I don’t want this horrifying misadventure to be repeated by any other adrenaline junkies with more cash than sense.

*What’s down there?* I asked the photographer.

*No idea. I just took the photo then headed on my way*, he replied.

And with that, the nameless user had sealed my fate. I was always going to visit the location, of course. I was drawn to it. But knowing that the photographer hadn’t even taken a *step* into the jaws of the staircase? Well, that only loudened the groan in my stomach. The mouth-frothing hunger to see this place with my own eyes. I imagined myself to be some twenty-first-century explorer on the verge of a monumental discovery.

And in fairness, that may have been so. But I don’t want you to find out by visiting the staircase for yourself.

I’m trying desperately to be as descriptive, yet *non*-descriptive, as possible. If anybody out there *does* possess the means to track down the location of the ‘FREE CANDY’ sign, I would seriously advise against using that skill.

After reading this story, it won’t take much to dissuade you.

The staircase’s entryway, which spanned the width of a typical household door, stood like a lonesome pillar amidst a mound of waste. Misshapen sheets of metal, shattered crumbs of plaster, and shredded plastic bags littered the abandoned floor of that forgotten building. I know what the place used to be, but I’m not going to tell you, obviously. What I will say is that it isn’t a place which should’ve sat above the horror I uncovered.

I shone my torch-light at the downward-sloping ceiling of the slender, enclosed staircase. Sketched on the underside of the slope, with black crayon, were the words: ‘FREE CANDY’. An abnormal advertisement written above an arrow which pointed down. Urging me to walk down the steps into the darkness. It didn’t take much urging, of course. I’d started the descent before even taking a picture of my own.

It was the muddy, maroon smears across the yellow walls which really unsettled me. Ominous marks that coated the interior of the claustrophobic passageway. In certain lights, the marks looked, to my eyes, like blood-painted handprints, but I tried to shake that notion from my head.

*You’re just frightened, and your imagination’s running wild*, I reassured myself.

I don’t know how many steps there were. I didn’t count. But it took roughly two minutes for me to reach the bowels of the abandoned building, and I was a little winded.

I won’t tell you what I expected to find downstairs, as that might reveal the nature of the semi-demolished building above, but I will tell you that my eyes widened disbelievingly when I found myself in the lobby of an underground cinema. It was not a derelict mall. I’ll tell you that much. The cobweb-ridden, crumbling theatre did not belong down there.

And, as if that weren’t unnerving enough, the cinema slowly revealed a series of horrifying traits. Firstly, I noticed that a solitary lightbulb shone brightly above the concession stand.

“How the fuck… *Who* the fuck is powering this place?” I whispered, inching forwards with the torch in my trembling hand.

More strangely than that, I didn’t even *need* the torch. The single bulb, swaying perpetually on a stringy, splaying cable, somehow illuminated the entire lobby. Revealed, beneath the dust and grime, a well-maintained establishment. The red-carpeted floors, donning a diamond pattern that both belonged to a bygone era, appeared eerily vibrant and untarnished. It was as if the place were simply in need of a little spring cleaning to look brand new once more.

The posters on the walls were inconsistent. Some were faded and dated. Others bore quite modern graphics. But what bound them all together was that they advertised films which had either passed me by or *never existed*.

*Shards of Space*

*The Exacter*

*Archie Bolton in The Real World*

“Hello?” I called.

The place didn’t feel abandoned to me. Old and forgotten, perhaps, but oddly well-preserved. The most disconcerting thing, of course, was the fact that electricity still powered the cinema. The abandoned cinema below an abandoned building. And everything about the place set my hairs on end. So, in spite of my urge to find out what was happening, it was an absolutely *batshit-bonkers* play to cheerily utter a yoo-hoo to the large, unnatural place.

Thankfully, there came no reply. No menacing door creaked open to reveal a mysterious figure. No malicious giggle echoed from the backroom of the establishment. Nothing called out in response.

Still, none of that settled my gut. It made things worse, though I did not know why. And as I crossed the red carpet towards the concession stand, I noticed something. Something which, disturbing as it may have been, at least felt *consistent* with the untoward sign at the top of the staircase. A piece of card was propped above the containers of sweets, and it read:

*First time at Cine Cinema? Help yourself to FREE pick ‘n’ mix! We won’t tell if you don’t.*

*DISCLAIMER: 1 portion per visitor. No more. No less.*

*Smile. You’re always being watched.*

Haunted by that final sentence, I snapped my head around and searched the expansive lobby for a couple of watching eyes in the darkness. There was nothing. But, again, that did not slow my heartbeat.

I feared the unseen thing in the emptiness of the cinema. If I were going to meet my end, I would've wanted to see it coming. I remember that strange thought ringing in my head.

*Will you calm the fuck down?* I thought. *There’s a reasonable explanation for all of this.*

However, that lie wasn’t working anymore.

As I squatted to eye the assortment of sweets in the glass casing, I gulped at the fresh liquorice, gummy bears, and cola bottles. Unless they’d been encased in futuristic preservatives, the candy should’ve rotted after only a year of the building being abandoned. And that fact, along with the many other facts surrounding me, solidified what I’d known since entering the cinema.

This place was *not* abandoned.

“Hello?” I called again, voice breaking.

*Will you stop that?* I asked myself, slapping my forehead with the heel of my palm.

I kept forgetting that instinct in my belly. That feeling of unevenness. A human wasn’t going to answer my calls. This was no cinema. It was an illusion that had lured me across an ocean.

I’m quite a spontaneous man. There’s no denying that. But even for *me*, this was a rogue move. I’d flown across the world to investigate a staircase. Was it a disturbing staircase that gained traction on Reddit? Sure. But at the end of the day, that hardly warranted an international flight. I’m not so brain-rotted that I’d believe otherwise.

I started to sense that I’d been intoxicated by the image. By the ‘FREE CANDY’ sign. The photograph had been alluring in some perturbing way.

Before I followed that thought to some sort of grand conclusion, there sounded a roar of brass instruments, like fanfare to signal the arrival of royalty.

I stumbled back from the concession stand, in fright, and rose to a standing position once more. My eyes darted to the side hallway as I searched for the source of the sound. Above the passage’s open doors, a sign displayed:

*Screens 1-11*

Another lightbulb, midway along the corridor, shone from the ceiling. This one, however, did little to illuminate the full length of the hallway. There were dark cavities untouched by the bulb’s glow, and I once again sensed the Watcher, whose warning had been printed quite clearly on the slip of card above the pick ‘n’ mix.

I didn’t want to enter that hallway. I truly didn’t. In fact, I’d wanted to turn and run the second I reached the bottom of the staircase. It wasn’t ego that kept me in the underground cinema. It was the invulnerable power that had pulled me across the ocean in the first place. The same power that pulled my legs, one after the other, in a stilted, unwilling walk towards the hallway. Towards the dissonant, chaotic music emanating from one of the cinema’s screens.

As I entered the corridor, torch shaking in my hand, I feared that my light might reveal some figure lurking in the recesses unlit by the hallway's single, swinging ceiling light. I didn’t want to venture beyond the reach of the bulb’s glow. The torch on its own would've done little to ease my nerves.

Thankfully, I didn’t have to walk far. The music was coming from Screen 3, and I found myself pushing the door with my free hand before I’d decided whether or not I even *wanted* to do so. I was starting to accept that I had no free will in the matter. I accepted it, but feared it.

Inside the room, I *certainly* needed my torch. The only other light was coming from the screen itself. A blinding whiteness. No adverts. No trailers. An absence of imagery. An absence of sound. Of course, I was grateful that the awful brass instruments had ceased the moment I opened the door.

It was clear, by this point, that I was going to sit down and watch whatever the wicked place willed me to watch. I had no control over my limbs, so I gave into the feeling. Allowed my wonky legs to carry me over to a seat a few rows away from the front. With a sweaty, fearful thump, I plopped down. The moment I did, the screen faded to black, as if it had been waiting for me.

Waiting for *eons*.

And then the title card appeared:

*A Day in the Garden with John Walton (1928)*

“*What the fuck?”* I screamed once my paralysed lips finally loosened.

My name was on the screen. Next to a date that meant absolutely nothing to me. There was no longer any doubt that I had been *brought* there.

The film’s opening shot revealed grainy, black-and-white footage of a town. And as the camera magnified one house in particular, my throat tightened.

The camera revealed my childhood home. Not just that, but *me*. Eight-year-old me, standing on the front lawn. Grass strands poked between my younger self's bare toes as he held his head back and absorbed the sunshine.

I remembered that day. It was a memory I’d long tried to suppress. But there was, of course, an added element of horror to this stroll down Memory Lane. My memory was being displayed on a film screen, featuring shots from numerous angles. Some were inches away from my face. And, as I said, I remembered that day.

I knew that there had been no cameras filming me.

The cinema’s revolving door of terrors had left me in tatters, but it wasn’t done spinning. What followed was the part of the memory that I had dreaded the most. As young John danced around in the grass, kicking up clumps of dandelions, a vehicle trundled down the street, and it stopped in front of the blissfully-unaware child. A white Morris Van with serif lettering on its side. The advertisement read:

*FREE CANDY! 96*

If ‘96’ were supposed to be the date, then the driver had got it all wrong.

As I watched, glued to the seat in the theatre, my heart throbbed erratically. Everything started to piece together, yet *nothing* pieced together.

Even on that day, in 1992, there had been something out-of-place about the vehicle with slim wheels, circular lights, and a boxy body. It belonged in 1928, which was the year of release that the cinema screen had listed. However, that was not the year in which *A Day in the Garden with John Walton* was filmed. Even as an eight-year-old, I knew that the vehicle did not belong in the early '90s. And the man who smiled at me did not belong either.

“Hello, Jonathan,” the driver of the Morris Van greeted from an ajar side-window.

The camera cut to him, but the shot was distorted. The picture bore holes which should have contained key features of the driver’s face. It was likely the result of frame burn, but that was fine. I didn’t need to be reminded of his features. I remembered his face well, even after burying that memory decades earlier. I remembered the man’s direful smile and well-combed moustache. Remembered the question he’d asked, which was captured in a crystal-clear whisper that boomed from the theatre’s many speakers.

“Would you like some free candy, Jonathan?” the stranger asked the frightened boy on the lawn.

“How do you know my name?” my younger self asked, tearful eyes filmed *impossibly* close-up.

I remembered it all with such clarity. Remembered everything *except* the cameras filming the interaction.

*This place isn’t right*, I thought, quivering.

“How do I know your name?” the man responded with a broad smile. “I know *all* of the hungry boys and girls, Jonathan. And you’re very hungry, aren’t you? Very, very, very…”

The screen suddenly plunged into darkness, cutting the image and silencing the audio. Of course, I didn’t need to be reminded of that awful day for a moment longer. I recalled what had happened next. I ran back to the house, screaming for my father, and the van driver fled before facing the full might of Mr Walton.

Sitting in the blackened cinema, I reached for my torch, then I stood up and cast the light around the room.

“… *hungry*,” finished a whispering voice from behind me.

I screamed at the delayed closure of the sentence, and I spun around to reveal, in the glare of my torch, that awful, smiling face behind me.

The man from my childhood.

He wore an unbranded, featureless outfit. Something typically donned by a plumber or a mechanic, not a candy salesperson. The man was not any of those things, of course.

He was not a man at all.

The malignant figure reached a hand forwards, and I froze as his soft fingers lightly brushed my face. I felt only a warm, soothing sensation. But a second later, as the man pulled his searching fingers away from my cheek, I yelled.

Hanging over the edge of his fingers was a strip of fleshy fabric. The man lifted it to his lips and gave it a timid, bashful lick with a long, white tongue. Then my cheek started to throb painfully. It scorched, in fact, and I reached a shivering hand to my face. I found a skinned wound that stung and stained my hand in blood.

My scream reached a crescendo then disappeared into nothingness as the man raised a finger to his munching mouth.

“Tastes like somebody needs a sweetie,” he mumbled through mouthfuls, hiccupping with delirious laughter. “You’ve been good for *so* long. It’s okay to be naughty, Jonathan.”

Mouth unable to release a sound, I swivelled on my heel and ran. Ran down the stairs. Ran out of Screen 3. I lit the way with a torch that flung up and down in my flailing hand, and I tried desperately to block out the clunking footsteps in tow.

The smiling man’s charge was accompanied by the sound of fanfare once more, though it was now wobbly and muffled. I started to wonder, in terror, whether the music might be coming from his own *mouth*, but I didn’t stop to turn and find out. I burst through the door as more laughter bellowed from behind me.

“Hungry…” the man called, either as a question or a statement.

I pelted through the lobby and found the staircase. Ascending it was *far* harder than descending it. Possibly due to my countless stumbles. My body wilted in the face of the following monster. A monster intent on seizing a man that it had been stalking for thirty-two years.

When I reached the building above, the clunking footsteps stopped, as if the creature were unable to exit its dungeon. I turned around, fully expecting to see nothing but darkness in the staircase. However, standing silently and motionlessly, a mere three or four steps from the entrance to the stairs, was the Morris Van driver.

He wasn’t smiling anymore. His lips were horizontal. Perfectly level. And his eyes did not blink as they surveyed me.

The driver twisted his head slowly as I backed out of the building. His gaze followed me as I moved away. When I reached my car, I looked back to see the man peeking his eyes past the edge of the staircase’s side-wall.

I fled across the sea. He did not follow.

That was five days ago. I’ve barely slept since. Barely eaten, as food only makes me think of the horrible things the Free Candy man said. I’m not safe. I’ve not been safe since I was a child.

And I’ll never be safe [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
