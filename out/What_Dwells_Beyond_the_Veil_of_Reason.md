Since I was young, my curiosity ventured into the great mysteries of the world. Who created us? Do we have a purpose? Is there any logic or structure within this seemingly chaotic universe?

I studied philosophy at university and became obsessed with metaphysics, foolishly believing that within it I would find the answers my intellect so desperately craved.

After years of participating in academic research, projects, and publications, the only rewards I had gained were earthly honors, the recognition of my peers, and the admiration of students just beginning their academic pursuits.

My years of youth had been squandered in sleepless nights devouring entire libraries, and my body had grown pale and frail, a faint shadow of what I once had been.

Yet none of that would have mattered had I achieved even a glimpse of certain, essential, divine knowledge.

I longed to know what lay hidden behind the impenetrable veil of our senses, at the very limits of our understanding, lurking in the shadows just beyond our reach.

The great philosopher Immanuel Kant had correctly outlined the boundaries of human understanding centuries ago, distinguishing between ***φαινόμενον*** and ***νοούμενον***. Our minds are capable only of perceiving phenomena, while things as they are in themselves remain forbidden, a profane knowledge, accessible only to a divine being.

Or so I believed...

It became clear that the path of intellect would not bring me to the destination I sought. Yet I thought that where academic rigor had failed, the study of the occult might succeed.

Magic and alchemy are as ancient as philosophy itself, and their purpose is precisely to transcend the material world, to penetrate the universal spirit of nature, and to bend it to our darkest desires.

I resolved to devote myself entirely to the study of these macabre arts, and if the outcome of my inquiries once again proved disheartening, perhaps I could take an easy step into the existential void, transcending the final frontier that all human beings must face at the end of their days.

The diversity of folklore promised new discoveries, and I felt that at last I might attain what I had long desired.

I traveled across Europe and the Americas, speaking with the greatest experts in the field: dark priests who professed their worship of the devil and sought to summon him; strange cults along the Amazon River still practicing human sacrifice to appease the malevolent spirits of nature; grimoires whose keepers dwelled in the presence of black magic, performing combinations of elements I had once thought impossible.

I consumed every manuscript and every book; I sacrificed all my ethical and moral values; I took part in every ritual known -and unknown- to mankind, yet nothing seemed to produce any truly transformative or transcendent effect.

My sadistic curiosity remained intact.

As I descended into the darkest recesses the human mind could conjure, nightmares stalked me day and night. An inevitable consequence of having witnessed so many dreadfull horrors.

Images spawned by human malevolence across the centuries: sigils carved in blood; guttural chants in forgotten tongues; bodies offered to the knife with blind fervor. All in pursuit of an impossible communion with forces unknown and incomprehensible.

I stood on the verge of surrender, ready to fall into nihilism and accept that life is but a futile path, devoid of meaning or discovery. A tapestry entirely random, beyond our control or prediction.

Gradually, my perception of reality became warped by gruesome imagery.

Most of the time, I could trust none of my senses. I seemed to hear the echo of a distant voice, trying to communicate with me through signs utterly unintelligible to any living being.

At that moment, I believed I was losing my sanity; it was a perfectly logical conclusion, considering the maelstrom of sinister experiences of the past years. Yet when my mind began to decipher fragments of meaning within those symbols, I realized that what was happening was not the product of madness, but something else entirely…

I spent every hour of the day trying to uncover some hidden sense in the stigmas that besieged my mind. Neither my logical faculties nor my linguistic studies could penetrate such abstraction.

The more I contemplated the figures, the delicate strokes, the impossible geometric complexity of those inert forms, the more I sensed an unknown awareness awakening within me. A connection… an immediate faculty for understanding the whole.

A dormant part of my mind -or perhaps one that had not existed before- awoke, and the doors of an abyss as old as time swung wide open.

From the unfathomable depths, something called to me: a primordial force, both seductive and terrifyingly familiar. It seemed to know me better than I knew myself and appeared eager to offer me the fulfillment of every desire, every lack, every failure.

That which dwells beyond the limits of human knowledge cannot be named, much less understood.

I could feel the answers to every question that had tormented me throughout my life.

The veil of uncertainty was lifted forever. The comprehension I had dreamed of so many times became reality… but the price was high… my own humanity.

I became one with that dark power that dwells just beyond the bounds of human understanding. We wait, patiently and inexorably, for the communion of all souls. Our work is unending...eternal.

I will remember the last thought I had before my final transmutation: “Ignorance is a blessing.”
