I went back to my dad's room in the hospital, to find him watching the news play on the tv in front of him. The muscles of his eye lids were dark and sick, struggling to open his eyes for too long. With a click of the door closing behind me, he turns his head and smiled when he saw me. "Judith? My girl, you came a bit early today?"

The muscles of my lips twitched as I tried to give him a smile; to hide the fact that I got fired. Actually, why should I hide that? I got a new job and it pays bloody well to keep his cancer treatment continuing. But wait, if I tell him that, what if he got a heart attack in front of me?! That'll shatter my soul.

"Yeah. You feeling any better though?" I asked while trying to keep my smile. Sadly, his smile faded, with the look of fear on his face. "No. Haven't got any better. I'm beginning to get worse."

"No! Don't say that! You're going to get better soon, I know it." I said, almost breaking my voice to a whimper.

"You remember the time your mother showed you some magic tricks?" His voice became low and tired, with his eye lids beginning to close, like the gates of heaven is closing, leaving a slight gap to reveal bits of light to follow.

"Yeah." I sat on the chair next to him with my hands on his. His hands are a bit colder than yesterday, which gave me a heart aching shock in my blood. I felt my smile slip away as I watch his mouth move tiredly.

"The one trick she showed you was the fast-growing flower. The look on your face meant so much to us both. It was amazing, but something about that trick left me to question. I asked her many times about it and all she said was 'sorry, it's a secret'. So, I gave up on that and believed she could've been a brilliant magician, right?" I can see he was smiling, not trying, feeling it. I felt a smile on my face too. A lovely and bizarre moment of our life.

I wanted my mom to teach me that a long time ago, but she always told me it's a secret trick I have to find on my own. I kept finding that secret nearly for 2 months, hoping I could find it. I bet every adult and teenager is amazed about kid's motivations. They just never seem to stop when they enjoyed so much of it. The reason I stopped was my mom showing me another trick. This time, no secret. So, I was so much into that trick and forgot about the growing flower secret.

Now I begin to question the same as my dad. How did mom do it?

"Yeah. I wish she's still here." I was still smiling when a tear trickle down my left cheek.

Suddenly, the volume from the TV caught my ears like a radio. I turned my attention to see a picture of a blue bright star shooting through the sky. I realized I had forgotten about Athena, yet when I looked around, she was nowhere to be seen.

*We still find no other evidence as to what this bright UFO is. This might be a terrorist attack on the Australian government or an aircraft sent by an unknown government. Strangely enough, it's at the same time of the frozen man incident. By the time the UFO disappeared into nowhere, the man’s name Peter Anderson awoke from his frozen state. In the report, doctors said it was a seizure caused in the brain.*

Of course, they would stick with the lies told by the victim. Surely, we all understand that no one is going to believe what really happened. If I've told someone that I saw God, they would laugh at me and start kicking me around, calling me a weirdo.

Until night time, I lay on the couch, watching the moon light shine into the room. I held my hands up to the silvery light. Its bright curtain washes over my hand like the ocean against the cliffs of the mountain.

I wondered what kind of job I'm in. She said it will be dangerous. I think I'm alright with that, as long as I give more time with me and my dad.

*You're lucky to have more time with your family.*

Athena's voice gave off a sombreness tone. I look to see her sitting before the moon light, as if fallen from heaven. I said nothing and closed my eyes. I wish I had those moments.

I slightly opened my weak eyes. My vision was blurry that I couldn't see her face. "Why did they split you from your parents?" I saw her head move a bit upwards, to face my exhausted face.

*They don't allow compassion, love, or anything that feels home. It distracts us and weakens our strength. It's what keeps us down. Being heartless is key to victory in wars.*

I closed my eyes shut, with a cold chill that could give me nightmares. Heartless soldiers with guarantee for victory, that just creates the monster, right? Why would people sacrifice themselves for wars? Why are they so willing to kill for what?

\-

I woke up and begin to wear my casual clothes, brush my teeth, and splash my face with water. Looking into the mirror to see the messy scribbled brown hair that would make me look like I go drunk from a party at night. But when I look into my eyes, I saw the left pupil glow a sea ocean colour. Of course, I'm slowly beginning to form with Athena. I guess that's how it is for me now and then. But what happens if we're finished? I don't know the word for it, but I won't keep scavenging for it in my head.

Before I left, I kissed my dad on the forehead, feeling the cold skin under my lips. I wanted to hug him terribly, but I thought I might crush him. I don't want to think too much about that.

I left the hospital and found the old lady waiting for me in the parking area. This time, she wore a much darker clothing and it seems some of her wrinkles disappeared. Did she just look a bit younger than before?

She gestured her hands to come into the woods. I followed with a sense of unnerving awareness. It's just something about this moment still makes me question why. It's like I'm getting closer to a strange large energy.

My question has been answered when we arrived to a pearly orb door, standing before us like a monolith.

"Your first mission of the day is eliminating a threat from the ancient oceans. The entire ocean has been poisoned for 50 years, so billions died. While others still have clean water, which the price is much higher than a car." The old lady broke the silence.

"Poisoned ocean and higher price than a car? You sure? Because the ocean here is still clean." This sounds unbelievable of course. And plus, everything here is moving as fine as usual, to which nothing big happened. Well, except for unheard incidents and all. These can still impact a bit on everyone in the world.

She gave me a wicked grin with a chuckle beneath her garlic breath. "Not here. You're going to another dimension." She held the door knob and twisted it, opening the door to reveal another bloody world! This is impossible, why is this happening and how did she do that? In the present days, we're pretty sure that the scientists around the globe still have no leads to creating a portal to another world. So now, I get to actually explore what's beyond our worlds.

"Save your questions later. Right now, you have a job to do. Start exploring, talk to someone who knows to have the benefits to the source, and don't waste time. I'm rather impatient." She then gave me a stare that sent chills through my back.

So then, I went through the door. When I got through, a strong blow of wind hit me, making me shake to the brim, and a bright light hits my eyes that I blinked shut from the bright spectrum. Then, when I opened my eyes, here I am. I've travelled to another world.

I turned around to see the door, but it's gone. I tried to talk to Athena but she wouldn't talk nor appear. This is it, time to do my job.

\-

The sky above the gloomy oozy clouds shows nothing but the toxic gas that scours the planet like death's curtain. The ocean below the hills is filled of oozing oil that I can tell are the poison the pollutes everything. It actually broke my heart, knowing that billions of people in the world can't ever taste the clean water ever again. There was no grass, other than the dry but crack filled grounds. The cracks hide a disgusting waste of toxic water that if I poke my finger into it it'll eat my skin. I felt a terrible fear in my chest as I looked around while walking down to the nearby city.

Once I've arrived, there was no one there walking on the streets. The windows don't have the shine of warm light, only to be covered by the green rust. When I looked into the window, there were corpses of men, women, and children. My heart broke, no, shattered. Looking at every corpse rotting, with their faces expressing deep pain and sadness. A literal child had a rust covered teddy bear in his arms. I couldn't help but shed a tear. But I still have to continue on.

As I walked, I saw the first light in this world. And light, I mean something that would come from a shelter. It was a bar, covered in moss and rotten plants. The windows exposed a warm light that defines that someone is in there. I know it, I believed it. I hope someone in there knows how it all happened in the first place. Who can tell?

Once I opened the rusty door, I found an old fat man sitting on the floor with a beer in hand. His scruffy large coffee beard stained by the many beers he drank. He looked like a giant who sat on his broken shattered throne, and he wore a stained dark night sky mariner outfit. That outfit is big enough to be worn around his large body, that I imagined it might rip and pop at any moment.

His face was plastered with depression. I stepped forward and was ready to ask the first question. "Hi. What happened here?"

When he looked up, I felt a jolt of terror in my body. His eyes are overshadowed by his cap, yet an exposed light of his pupils’ stares into my soul. "What happened? You mean you have absolutely no idea what in the bloody hell happened here." His voice was low like the devil. His voice and form already intimidated me to run, even though he wasn't doing it on purpose.

I wanted to just walk away or literally run and leave. But how much time am I going to waste searching for another to answer? I have to know right now, even though I fear him, I have to. "I just wanted to know how this place became like this?" I said with a shaking voice.

"You're not from here. I know. Bloody hell, it doesn't matter anyway." He then held his beer in front of him and took a long drink from its content. I stepped closer and sat on the chair just 5 or 6 from him.

"What do you mean it doesn't matter. I can help-"

"You can't!" He shouted, nearly making me fall of the chair. I can feel the tears in my eyes starting to swell. I tried to control my own voice while I spoke out. "But why? Why can't I help?"

He turned his face away, narrowing his eyes to the frame on the wall of his right. He breathed a sigh before saying. "Because it's too late. There's absolutely nothing we can do. Those rich bastards, they have the clean water to themselves. The people around the world got infected that there's not enough hospitals to hold on to them! And it was all my bloody fucking fault!" He threw his beer bottle at the wall, shattering on impact. I nearly jumped out of my chair from the sound of it.

As I watched him flex his temple with his fingers, I begin to share this some sort of similar emotion. I thought about my parents and my other family members. Is this going to be who I'm going to become after my dad dies? This just terrifies me worser.

Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, Athena appeared before the man out of nowhere. She grabbed the collar of his stained uniform, with clenching fists that pulses a sense of stubbornness. To my shock, the man seems to be able to see and comprehend her existence.

***Listen to me!! Drowning yourself in deep guilt and self-hatred will never get you anywhere you wanted! If you wanted to find peace, YOU must deny your selfish hopelessness and give yourself to the WILL to do BETTER!! YOU WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CHOICES!! DO YOU WANT PEACE OR NOT!!!*** Her voice was thunderous, terrifying, and God like. Never have I ever heard and witness such voice and demand like this. I fell from my chair when she began to shout, hitting my back on the ground. I couldn't feel anything when she shouted. It was like listening to some otherworldly god's wrath.

Everything went silent. Even the wind outside. I realized I forgot to breath that I begin to inhale the air, with a cough out of my dry throat. Before me, the man's jaw dropped, metaphorically. Athena dropped him, letting him sink deep into his mind. I tried to speak up, but can only make little. "Athena? What?"

She didn't turn to look at me, just staring at the old man still collecting thoughts from his mind. When he looked up, I can see a change in him. His face no longer depressing. "A long time ago, I was commanded to bring something from the centre of the pacific oceans. No questions were given. I didn't know what it was until I saw it with my own eyes. At the very centre was an ancient guardian that keeps the ocean clean from the poison itself.

"I didn't know nor understood about it. So, I fought it without hesitation. It's the most challenging fight I've ever had in my life. It took about 4 minutes to capture the entity, and I sailed back to the west with it. That is where this bloody poison started to take billions of lives.

"I didn't realize that they were actually planning to create a new society." Before he could continue speaking, I cut in asking. "What's the new society?"

He looked at me, sharing his disgust with my own. I can tell it's not going to be an answer I'd like to hear. "The Heaven for the rich." I immediately jumped up with disgust in my heart! Those rich bastards care less about people, instead they care more about their damn gold and material! "The fuck!" My voice still shaking with nerves but with the disgust.

"Tch. That's the same reaction I had kid.

"They used the guardian to store their own clean water. They made the water's price high when the ocean started to become toxic. They bloody knew this was going to happen. With the clean water in their hands, they lead billions to die, except for the last of the richest people on earth. Their money expanded, and so is their dominion over the society. They created a new bloody fucking heaven, where the richest controlled EVERYTHING!" He spat on the ground by his leg. I can understand it's him spitting on the bastards.

My fear is overwhelmed by the demand for those bastards to pay for this. Using the old man to get their needs. How... How dare they! I can't argue enough while writing this, it was terrible for me to think about.

"The guardian, it was supposed to protect the people, from its opposite. I tried to fight it off, but I was left completely injured, nearly melted me into a puddle of toxic meat and bone. It could've killed everyone if I kept going, so I had to leave it to do its curse.

"I did everything, even demanding the rich to give water. But they were too powerful, and they knew I'm going to fight back. And then I was left here to watch everyone die. The air turned intoxicating, choking people to death. The rain is damn worse."

And with that, I got enough information to know what had happened. I thought it was enough.

I sat on the floor across from him. I can tell both of us have the same idea. Justice. I think we both wanted them to pay for their destruction, their damn bloody greed. I stood back up and walked to the old man. I held my hand out to him. "I think we should go together. What do you say?"

He looked at my hand, then to me. I can't tell of his expression, since it’s all overshadowed by his cap. When he looked down, I thought he was quitting the idea. "I've failed everyone. There was no one left but them. But now that she mentioned it." He grabbed my hand and I started pulling him up in surprise. I swear I felt a smile on my face. I looked at Athena, with the face to annihilate the enemy. I can feel her demand for vengeance swell in my heart, but that didn't bother me. It was thrilling.

I looked to the old man in shock. He's much Much taller, exactly like a giant towering over me. About 9 or 10 feet tall. His body makes himself much more intimidating. When I saw his face above, it was shined by the light. His eyes are like the shine of a great warrior, with a deep red scar on his left face.

"I'm going to make sure that every person who died will have peace."

\-

Right now, we're sailing on a yacht, to the place the old man is taking us. I asked for his name before, so instead of old man, his name is Marcus Noe. He didn't give me any more details about himself. Just telling me he's an old man. I wonder what kind of stuff he does. I mean, I know he defeated a guardian from the Pacific Ocean, so that means he could be a hunter or what?

As we sail across the ocean, I wondered what kind of monster was causing the intoxication of the ocean. The guardian protected this planet from it, and Marcus said they were both opposite of each other. It's kind of like 2 different faces of the same coin. One being the devil, and the other being the angel. Flip a coin and you'll see what face you'll see.

I turned around to Athena, looking up at the gloomy sick sky. "Athena, why were you shouting like that?" She moved her head to face me, with sad eyes. *I had someone who had the exact fate as Marcus. I believe Marcus can truly find peace, I had to because I wanted him to have it, and not fall just like him.* She turned to look at Marcus, steering the yacht head on.

I'm surprised his weight didn't put so much pressure on the yacht. Somehow, this yacht is like no other. I wondered about his other relatives, other friends he might have. I went to greet him and asked curiously. "Do you any family members and friend back before this happened?"

He slightly turned his head, facing me with only half of his face in my view. He sighed and said this. "I had. I have friends before. They're the loyal friends you wanted to have in life. Deimos, Albert, Conan, Davis, Benjamín, and my best friend Odin. He's the best of us, even in the darkest of wars, he kept that smile on his face just to keep us going." He grew a slight warm smile. Sadly, it disappeared quickly.

"He died from the toxic waters. And others followed. Except me." I didn't realize until he reminds me, he still lives without a single hint of infection or sickness. "How are you not being sick?" His hands begin to grip tightly to the steering wheel. "I'm not like any human being. More like some sort of bloody hybrid from.... I don't really know anymore...."

We both stood in silence, whilst the waves of the ocean around us splashes into each other. Until Marcus broke the silence between us. "I had a wife and child. Her name was Sharon, the most beautiful lady I've ever met and loved. And my child is Conner, a stubborn child of mine. Tch, must've gotten from me." He smiled again; this time much warmer. I felt my own smile came along too.

But unfortunately, his smile faded into guilt. "They mean everything to me, and I've....I've failed them. My wife was the first to die from the toxic air. I was holding her in my arms, running to the hospital with my son by my side. Before I could reach to the hospital, she was already dead. Her last words... They were choked away. I couldn't hear her, I kept running until I accepted that she's gone, because of me.

"My own son soon followed the same death. It was the day after my wife's death. His words too are choked away. I kept him close, hugging him, pleading to God for mercy. But he died. I hated god for making such beasts."

I stare at him with a broken heart in my soul. Listening to this nearly made a tear drop from my eyes.

After that, we shared about our own family stories; our life, families, experience, and memorable moments. We had our chuckles, smiles, even the long face. I wanted Athena to share with us, and so she did.

When I realized what's going on, I immediately shut my mouth and walked away. He was going to say something, but Athena stopped him. I couldn't hear what they were saying, or maybe they weren't talking at all. I can't have any more people I start to care for. I just can't. It shocked me how I literally forgot about it. It was amazing! I can't do this! If I start to really care for him, and if he died, I'm going to break down again like before! Not again!

Everything went silent until we finally arrived to where we're going to start. It was tall, real tall. The size of a tower that reaches through the clouds. It was filled with a rich pearly wall that could be made from heaven. The walls are decorated with sigils and other kinds of majestic paintings. My fear of loss was overwhelmed by the sight of the tower. This could be a tower that can reach space, I thought. Regardless, we're going to take it all down.

"I warn you, once we enter through the gate, we'll be facing dangerous security. So, it's best to meet the government without force. So, no fighting or anything else, follow my lead."

Before us, a hidden gate revealed itself and opened to reveal the alerting red flash of light. Soldiers of bright pearly and golden armour marched to our direction, with guns that I don't seem to recognize at all. The interior is just made of some sort of silver, with bright warm lights from above the ceiling.

As we enter through, the soldier raises their guns, pointing at us with it. I don't know how dangerous these weapons are, and that's what make me gulp. I felt my legs are shaking slightly to move. I wanted to fly away from this place, but I need to do this.

We both raised our hands, except for Athena, which kind of felt funny at first.

As the gates closed behind us, we stepped on the metal ground and was being pointed by guns. I wonder what other dangerous criminals would feel when they got guns on their faces. For me, I felt that I wanted to stand frozen, not making a single move as I hold my breath.

Marcus's footsteps on the ground created a wave of echo around us. I thought I saw one of the soldiers’ step back, but I guess I was imagining it.

We stood very still until we are met by a man, with a clean white top hat and a single circular glass on his right eye. He wore a Victorian suit that matches the same colour as his hat. Right in front of me is none other than those rich assholes from cartoons.

Right now, I guess you can say, things are going to get shittier than ever?
