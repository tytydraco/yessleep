The Sound of Static

I’ve never been much of a TikTok user, but about a month ago, my best friend Emily convinced me to join. “It’s harmless fun,” she’d said. Scrolling through videos of dance trends, funny skits, and cute pets felt mindless and entertaining—until I stumbled upon it.

It started on a Friday night. I was lying in bed, scrolling through my “For You” page, when a video popped up. It was grainy, like it had been recorded on an old VHS tape. The screen flickered with static, and the caption read: “DO NOT WATCH THIS ALONE.”

I should’ve swiped away, but curiosity got the better of me.

The video showed a dark room illuminated by a single flickering bulb. A distorted voice whispered:
“Once you see, it sees you too.”

I shivered, but before I could process what that meant, the screen cut to a figure standing in the corner of the room. Its face was obscured, its body unnaturally thin and twisted. It didn’t move, but the longer I stared, the more I felt like it was looking directly at me.

The video ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my reflection in the black screen of my phone.

I tried to scroll to the next video, but TikTok froze. The app wouldn’t respond, and my screen filled with static. Then, my phone vibrated violently, and the same distorted voice whispered through the speaker:
“You shouldn’t have watched.”

I threw my phone across the room, my heart pounding. It was just a glitch, I told myself. Just a creepy video meant to scare people. But when I retrieved my phone, the TikTok app was gone.

That’s when the strange things started happening.

The first night, I woke up to the sound of static coming from my living room. My TV, which I hadn’t turned on in days, was flickering with the same static as the video. I turned it off, but the uneasy feeling lingered.

The next night, I started hearing whispers. They were faint at first, like someone was talking just outside my bedroom door. When I worked up the courage to look, no one was there.

By the third night, I saw it.

I woke up at 3:12 a.m., the same time every night since watching that video. My room was dark, but I could make out the figure standing in the corner, just like in the video. It was tall, its limbs unnaturally long, and its head tilted at an impossible angle. Its face was still obscured, but I could feel its gaze piercing through me.

I wanted to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. It didn’t move, it just stood there, as if waiting for something.

When I blinked, it was gone.

I stopped sleeping after that. I couldn’t close my eyes without seeing it in the corner of my room. Even during the day, I felt its presence—like someone was watching me from the shadows.

I tried everything to get rid of it. I deleted the TikTok app, reset my phone, even went as far as smashing it with a hammer. But nothing worked.

Last night was the worst.

The whispers were louder, overlapping with the sound of static. My bedroom door creaked open, and I saw it standing at the foot of my bed. This time, it moved. Its head jerked toward me, and it leaned closer.

Its face… I can’t describe it. It was like every nightmare I’ve ever had compressed into one horrifying image.

Before I blacked out, it whispered:
“Tag, you’re it.”

I woke up this morning to find my phone, perfectly intact, sitting on my nightstand. The TikTok app was back, and a new video was playing on repeat.

It was me. I was standing in the corner of someone else’s dark room, my head tilted at an impossible angle.

The caption read: “DO NOT WATCH THIS ALONE.”
