 

   Everyday, as a kid I merely dreamed of being able to go out with a friend or something and see a movie, hang out together. My mother told me I was too young to go out all by myself, I pouted and stomped away. My mother passed away 3 years ago from an unknown cause.. Now that I am old enough, me and my friend Mel went to go see a new film – but I think it’s more than that.   
  We arrived at the movie theater late at night, it was a midnight screening, I guess for the “spooky” effects to be enhanced. It was a horror film we were viewing tonight. We got out of my beatdown car, as I offered a hand out to her, she took it smiling at me. “Oh we have a gentleman tonight?” she joked, nudging me with her arms as I just awkwardly nodded. “Of course.” I sweated nervously. Holding her hand, I walked her across the parking lot and up to the ticket master I noted he honestly just looked done with everything and everyone.   
“One ticket for The Flesh Of The Film” I tried to sound as normal as I could but there was nervousness seeping into my words. I got out my cash as me and the Ticket Master exchanged the tickets and money. We made our way towards the doors as I grabbed the handle opening it as a creak sounded breaking the silence of the night. Voices and sounds were heard as the world came to life again.  


I let her in first, because ladies first of course. Maybe I was trying too hard to be nice or impress her.  We skipped popcorn and candy and soda, as it was almost showtime. We made our way down the dark hallway dimly lit by small bulbs on the walls. We took our seats just in time as the film sprung to life, the audience quieting down.   
First it was odd, it was loud and static for five minutes. People began to mumble in confusion until motion came. It was like, I was hypnotized, Mel seemed like that too. As a forest scene played out. Eerie music broke through the silence. Suddenly Mel stood up, shouting something in another language. I froze the audience standing up as she pointed at me, I felt hands grab me as the Ticket Masters voice came seemingly out of nowhere. He grabbed me as he shoved me out of the doors, screaming at me to run the audience coming upon us, I shook my head. “I am NOT leaving you.”   


Mel charged and like a rabid dog latched her teeth onto my hand as I was reaching out for the Ticket Master, I screamed a black ooze leaking out of my wound.   


I shook my hand as she grinded her teeth back and forth, reaching her hands up for my neck I suddenly saw a flash as the Ticket Master – his actual name Jared as I caught a glimpse of his nametag, slam a bucket of popcorn over her head, she faltered a demonic screaming coming from her, I grabbed Jared by the shirt collar almost choking him as we slammed the doors behind us, wails of the audience and Mel sounded out.   


He quickly locked the doors, as I realized my hand was going numb I brought it up to my face as it was leaking blood and black goo. Jared shook his head telling me not to look and he quickly pushed me towards the theater's doors. I had trouble speaking. “How- How did you know-” he cut me off, lifting his head up more towards the light as I caught a glimpse of his purple pupils that looked like snakes.   


He coughed out black goo. “It's a trap. They turned me years ago. They-you were supposed to be a sacrifice.” He began to shake as he mouthed the words. Eyes widened I did not respond and made my way back to my car holding my ruined hand. I turned my face to the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of my pupils which were turning faint purple.  


 I took a knife I had in the glove box and painfully amputated my wounded hand as I watched the purple drain from my eyes as they instead turned gray. The hand fell with a thud to the floor. I leaned back and sighed, bleeding out I heard a smack against the window. It was Jared. But he was like a demon.
