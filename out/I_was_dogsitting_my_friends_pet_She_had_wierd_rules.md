“Yea sure, I’ll be there tomorrow. Ok. See you there then.”

I hung up the call with Emma, a friend of mine. Little did I know that would be the biggest mistake of my life. At that moment David bounded from the kitchen, holding soda cans and Doritos bags.

“Yo Owen. Ready for the night of your life?” David asked eagerly.

“I’m stoked. But I need to tell you something first. I’m dog sitting Emma’s pet tomorrow, so we won't be able to hang out.”

“It’s fine. I was planning to meet up with my mom anyways. I don’t think you should go to June’s house. Heard it’s spooky as hell.”

“What can go wrong? Enough chit-chat. Pick up that controller or else you owe me that thousand bucks.”

The next day, I arrived at her house. It was nothing like what David had said yesterday. White house with red shingles for the roof, with a huge front yard. Dog toys were scattered everywhere. I opened the gate and went up to the door. Before I raised my hand to knock, Emma stepped out, with her dark red dress and huge circle earrings. Her blonde hair flowed gently with the breeze. She looked astounding.

Emma’s green eyes opened wide and she broke into a smile. “Oh hey, didn’t expect you to come here quickly. Come in. I’ll be with you for a few minutes before I leave. Have to do something out of town.”

In a few minutes we were talking about various topics, the latest songs, what movies to watch, etc. Suddenly she got up to leave.

“By the way, there’s a piece of paper on the dining table. It has a few house rules. Take care. And thanks again.”

She pulled me into a hug, patted my back and then went out the door. In a few minutes I was sitting on the couch, watching Netflix on my laptop. Just then, a golden retriever came in with a piece of paper in his mouth. He put it down on the coffee table and gently laid down on my lap.

“Nice to see you again Daisy.” I stroked the dog as I watched the Netflix show still running.

I had been introduced to Daisy a few months back by Emma, and now it looks like the dog has gotten really friendly with me. I shifted my gaze from the laptop to the dog, when I saw the paper, sitting on the coffee table. I paused my show, got the dog off my lap and picked up the paper. On it were rules.

**\~HOUSE RULES. PLEASE FOLLOW EVERYTHING OR ELSE IT WILL KILL YOU.\~**

1. **Lock all windows before turning off the lights at night.**
2. **Always keep a light on wherever you are.**
3. **If you hear the doorbell at midnight, do not answer it.**
4. **If you hear a child crying and running down the halls, hide in the little storage room under the steps. Do not look back for Daisy.**
5. **Do not enter the basement.**
6. **If it is in the room at night, pretend to be asleep.**
7. **If you see it when you are not pretending, run to the back. There, you will proceed to set the house on fire. Again, do not look back for Daisy.**

I went over the contents of the paper again, confused. Number 7 sounded kind of odd. I had a million questions, the prominent ones questioning why I should not get Daisy when I experience rules 4 or 6, and what is “it”. I shot a glance at Daisy. She seemed playful, chewing on the stuffed toy bone and growling. Nothing’s going to happen. Everything’s going to be fine. Little did I know, the events would turn out very differently.

At around 10pm, I was beginning to feel sleepy, so I headed upstairs. I turned off every light, downstairs, closed the windows downstairs and proceeded to head up to the guest bed. There’s no fan or air conditioner there, so I had to open the window. I turned off the lights too, because I believe that Emma is doing all of this to play a prank on me. The cool night breeze forced me to drift off to sleep in no time.

Around midnight, I woke up to the doorbell. Someone was frantically pressing it, like they were impatient. I turned on the bedroom light and went downstairs. Then a memory flashed across my mind. Rule number 3 - don’t answer the doorbell at midnight. What if it’s someone who coincidentally came at midnight. I opened the door to be greeted with nothing.

The next morning, I woke up to Daisy barking. I got up, attended to Daisy and went about my day. Late in the afternoon, it began to rain and Daisy came inside, soaked. She then ran to the halls before I could grab her. The next thing I heard sent shivers down my spine. A child was running down the halls, crying and pounding on doors. I did not stick around to find out who it was. Without looking back I headed to the storage room and waited there. The child stopped at the door of the storage room, and began pounding. When I did not respond, the child whispered,

“I will be back, Owen.”

The child then proceeded to giggle and I heard the front door open and slam shut. I got out of the room and saw blood trails heading to the front door. How did that child know my name? I couldn’t find Daisy anywhere. I thought she ran to a room because she might have been freaking out. That will not be the only event happening that day. When night came around, I went to sleep forgetting to leave the lights on and closing the windows. Late in the night I heard soft breathing sounds beside me. I figured that it was Daisy so I just tried to go back to sleep. Then I remembered something. I left Daisy downstairs. My heart started to pound faster as I slitted my eyes open. There it was, looking over me. It was a large shadowy creature, about seven feet in height, two eyes slightly dangling from its sockets, and a wide, bloody grin spread over its face. Long, sharp claws It was nothing that I had seen. I began freaking out so much that I lost unconsciousness.

I woke up late the next day. I felt like what happened last night was a dream, until I saw the scratch on the window and shuddered. I went to take a cold bath to refresh myself. Later in the day when I was reading, I heard knocking on the basement door. Then the rules popped into my head. Number 5 - do not enter the basement. I looked over at the door, and saw the same scratches as the one on the window. I told myself not to go in there at all costs, but curiosity got the better of me as I slowly opened the door. There was no light switch at the bottom, so I cautiously headed down the wooden stairs that creak at every step. At the bottom, I found a hurriedly destroyed star in a circle with candles inside of it. Satanic ritual. What was Emma doing?

I never had a chance to give a possible solution when I heard a bark behind me. There was Daisy, happy as ever. I took a step forward, but Daisy stepped back and showed a wide, bloody grin. I couldn’t believe this. Slowly but surely, Daisy turned into that monster from last night. I ran up the basement stairs but couldn’t make it fully as Daisy clamped onto my leg. I felt the claws digging deep into my skin. I looked back and saw the crimson red blood rushing out from my leg. I was dragged down into the basement slowly, then I had an idea. I kicked Daisy’s hand with my other foot. Daisy temporarily let go of my leg, which allowed me enough time to head upstairs. When I reached the top and looked down, Daisy was there, showing that horrible grin. I went out the back as fast as I could, not bothering to burn the house. I limped all the way home, and bandaged myself.

A few days later, Emma came to my house. She said that she could not stay there as Daisy was still in the basement. All this happened a few months ago. We ended up staying together in my house and soon we began to go on frequent dates. The reason I’m typing this now is because last night, I saw Daisy at the window with that same grin, but she looked different. Blood was all over her face and her eyes were bright red. 

What should I do? I need to do something to save myself and Emma because Daisy has found her way into the house. Through the window.
