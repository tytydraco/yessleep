“It’s not a downgrade, it’s a fixer upper,” is what I told myself when I moved into this house a week and a half ago. Just ignore the fact I had gotten fired the week before that and my lack of handyman skills and the narrative works. As I moved my meager boxes out of the moving truck and closed the busted screen door, it finally sank in that this excuse for a latrine pit was now my permanent residence.

The living room has no lights to show the peeling yellow paint on the walls. The stairs creak so loud it makes my ears hurt. I can barely turn around in the kitchen. Several posts in obscure locations support a sagging ceiling covered in water stains. My bedroom has no insulation for temperature regulation. Not much compared to my studio apartment downtown, but my luck hasn’t totally run out. The neighbors are quiet and so is the street. Maybe too quiet. A week and a half in, and I’ve barely heard anything outside.

The silence didn’t last as long inside the house. Three days ago, something started tapping in the walls. It started at about 9:00 pm and made its way throughout the house. I cursed the possums, bats, raccoons, and rats that might be living in the walls as I tossed and turned that night. I got the place fumigated and sealed the next day.

Two days ago, the lights started flickering, and some of my food started to spoil. Enraged, I called the electrician, who said the wiring was fine and then charged me a couple hundred bucks for nothing. The tapping persisted that night.

Last night, it escalated. The creaking of someone climbing the stairs echoed in the house. I cowered in my bed as the advance warning made its way to my door. The knob slowly twisted. With nowhere in my tiny bedroom to hide, I waited with bated breath, covers pulled up to my eyes, frozen in terror.

The door loudly creaked open, and moonlight from the window in the hall showed no one standing in the doorway. It felt like every part of my body was pins and needles, and I couldn’t move.

Something came into the room. I could feel a presence stepping across to the wall in front of me. My body fused in anticipation of reveal, but whatever it was wasn’t looking at me. Instead, I watched as dark letters painted themselves onto the wall. Millimeter by millimeter, as with great concentration: “DONT SLEEP” was all it said. It may have been minutes; it may have taken hours. Then the presence left the room in almost an instant, the door slammed shut, footsteps rumbled down the stairs, and the house was silent.

Too afraid to move, I managed to plop over into the fetal position and started to fall asleep once I stopped shaking. Then, I heard a man’s voice speak.

“Dude, let’s go. I’m loving the classic poltergeist vibes so far.”

I sat up and looked around. It sounded like someone had said it directly next to my head. How was someone in my house?

“Hello?” I whispered into the dark.

Another man spoke, a little deeper than the first. “Yeah man, this is starting off like one of those weird haunting stories. Should be fun to see how it plays out.”

“Hello?” I said louder, now confused that both voices sounded like they came from right next to me.

“I mean, it is a poltergeist, right?” said the first voice.

The second voice responded nonchalantly. “Yeah, tapping in the walls, electrical problems.”

“Hello?” I yelled at the top of my lungs. I sprang out of bed and walked out into the hallway, looking for some YouTube prank show sitting at the bottom of the stairs to surprise me.

“See, the thing that gives me a little pause with that is the message on the wall and the feeling of presence in the room,” said the first guy.

The second replied as I creaked down the stairs, ready to throw hands with any person or ghost that might be in my house. “No that still feels pretty typical for poltergeists.”

“Yeah but the writing and the time it takes seems like some level of intelligence.”

“Who the hell is talking?” I yelled at an empty living room.

The second voice didn’t answer my question. “There are poltergeists that like, take the form of little kids and draw on the walls. It’s more of a loose classification, I think.”

I was getting fed up. Why did it sound like it was in my ears? “Come out, ok? If this is some prank, I get it, go viral, whatever. Please, I just want to sleep.”

The first voice continued like I hadn’t said anything. “Well if it isn’t Mr. Classification, Harris himself? Where’d you learn all this?”

“YouTube, Isaac. You should try it sometime,” said the second voice, Harris, apparently.

“Need I remind you I have more subscribers than you?” said Isaac.

“Oh you want to bring that up?” said Harris sarcastically.

It wasn’t even coherent anymore, and I was fuming mad. “I swear, whoever you are, I’ll kill you! I’m gonna find you and rip out your throat!”

“Of course, you’d want to be the one to compare sizes. I still got you beat in one category,” said Harris.

Isaac was deadpan. “Harris?”

Harris was giggling. “Yeah Isaac?” I was cursing both of them.

“Harris,” Isaac sounded like he was starting to laugh. “I try to make a nice little horror podcast, and you just have to make it dirty.”

“You like it when I make it dirty.” They both burst out laughing. I was about to tear my ears out. No matter where I went the voices sounded like they were right in my ears.

“Well there’s one thing for sure…” said Harris. I slumped against the wall, defeated as to what was going on.

“What’s that?” said Isaac.

“This guy’s gonna die.”

“Oh yeah, he’s totally gonna die. He’s super clueless. I can’t wait.”

“Shall we move on to the next part?”

“Yeah, let’s.”

I felt like I was boxing shadows. The voices didn’t speak up the rest of the night. I fell asleep curled against the wall, terrified of whatever fate I had stumbled into.

I woke up this morning to a tired beam of sunlight peering through musty shades giving the living room an almost toxic glow. I made my way to the kitchen, looking if there might be any evidence it was some dream or a weird break-in. The quiet street outside had no cars, much less disembodied people or dark figures.

As I’m sitting at my card table in the kitchen, my head is swimming. Am I being haunted? Am I being pranked? Nothing on social media shows anything like this. The noise was right in my ears. Like I was listening to their podcast.

If anyone knows how the hell to deal with this, please help me.
