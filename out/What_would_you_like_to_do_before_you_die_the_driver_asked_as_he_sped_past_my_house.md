“What would you like to do before you die?” the driver asked me right after we started.  
  
What a strange question, I thought, looking at the glowing dashboard of his car. His phone was attached under the air vent and showed a small blue arrow moving along my route home.  
  
“What do you want to do before you die?” he insisted.  
  
I thought he was talking on the phone at first and looked in the rearview mirror only to see his huge brown eyes staring at me. He had a look of desperation on his face, although I could only see the pupils the size of a pinhead and small red veins penetrating the white.  
  
I tried to unlock my phone and ignore him. He was probably not all there or wanted to make conversation. Anyway, he would probably understand the message and leave me alone with these questions. Outside, the rain was falling on the streets. Gray puddles formed at the edge of the sidewalks and the yellow lights were just fading. The apartment buildings had soft lights running up to the sky. The street was empty and only our small car was speeding continuously between the dashed lines.  
  
“This is the last time I ask you. What would you like to do before you die?” the man turned the mirror towards me and then cleared his throat.  
  
I couldn't think of anything. No one has ever asked me that before. I looked out the window and at him in silence, trying to think of something. Time seemed to slow down and on the dashboard, the speed was increasing steadily and quickly up to 60, 70, 80, and suddenly we were driving through the city at 120 km/h. The man swerved between cars and I held on to the seats, trying not to fall over when he made turns.  
  
In my panic, I tried to think of any possible answer and then a text message appeared on my phone. “I saw Alexandra with her new boyfriend at the restaurant today. I'm here now. Do you want me to send you a picture? The guy looks super rich...”  
  
“I want to talk to my ex-girlfriend one last time!” I shouted in his ears and the car started to slow down.  
  
Large tears formed in his eyes and then he wiped his nose with a handkerchief.  
  
“Why?” was his short answer.  
  
Why? Well... I started to tell him about her and how happy we were for 3 years until she cheated on me. I told him that it would be like a consolation for me... I wanted to know why she did it. She left without leaving a message or telling me anything.  
  
The man seemed to be moved by my story and even asked if I could show him some pictures of us. It still hurt to look at them, so I opened the gallery on the “once upon a time...” album and handed him my phone. That screen could poison me with just a few touches. It was something so intimate but very liberating at the same time. I felt that he understood me. I wanted to share my pain with someone, maybe that way, it would be easier.  
  
The driver looked through the pictures, exclaiming here and there how beautiful we were together. What a wonderful family we would have had or what a shame it ended. He seemed to be moved and when he reached the last picture, I reached to take the phone back on the back seat.  
  
“What a pathetic wish for a last wish!” he said, throwing my phone out the window.  
  
The shock that froze my blood was indescribable. I didn't know what to do without my phone. I didn't know any number other than the emergency number and I had never been in this situation. I looked ahead and could see the arrow passing my house and the driver pressing “Ride confirmed.” And then he closed the app.  
  
“I'm afraid to die alone...” he said, wiping his tears with a handkerchief.  
  
The car accelerated faster and I could hear him revving it up to redline. The engine roared and the air conditioner cold seemed to cut through my face. I didn't know if it was real what was happening. The minutes seemed to have stopped and the needle on the speedometer passed 140... I could feel the vibrations of the wheels and every pothole. I looked towards the doors, towards the city... we were getting close to the exit... The cars were getting rarer and I was praying to see a patrol car or anything... 

I still didn't believe him but I slowly approached the door. His eyes were looking at the road so intently that sweat formed between the wrinkles on his forehead. I reached for the lever and a silver handle caught my eye as the street light flew above the car like the last firefly on earth. I could already see the exit sign for the city... To jump or not to jump? I knew that if something happened, I should never let the kidnapper take me to a second location... But what if I jumped and I died? What if he came back for me? But I hadn't even seen his face... Only those strange eyes with pupils the size of a small bead...

  
I was holding on to the door, resting my forearm on the plastic support, and it felt like I was in a tunnel. My ears were pounding from the speed and my heart was beating to the rhythm of train wheels on the tracks. To jump or not? Do I have the courage to do it or do I die as this madman wants? One last look at the dashboard... 160 km/h... I won't make it... but maybe it slows down if I open the door... 

  
The car managed to slow down. A driver was turning left on a back road. Now is the time. My fingers were checking the grip to know for sure what I needed to pull, I only had one chance. It's now or never. 100... 90... 60... 50... I pull the handle and a metallic click sounds. The door doesn't open. I try 2-3-4 times...nothing...child protection locks....The driver looked at me and seemed even more nervous. His bushy eyebrows descended harder over his eyes and it was as if darkness invaded his pupils... I have never seen such an evil man before... I felt that he was evil somehow...

  
 "I'm not a bad man... even if it seems so now... I'm just afraid of death..." - he said in a defeated tone and I saw how his eyebrows relaxed. “I understand you're young and you'd like to live... you were unlucky enough to be my last race today. I've been asking people all day what they would do before they die. Their answers were so pathetic: I'd like to skydive, I'd like to go to Dubai, I'd like to get married... Well, once you do that, what's to stop you from dying?”

  
I was surprised by his monologue. I couldn't think of anything now to get him to stop the car so I decided to listen to him. I was hoping it wouldn't be the last negotiation in my life because I'm not good at negotiations at all. I'm not a persuasive man. I would even say that I am a man with a boring life in the eyes of others. I work as a cashier 9-5, live in a studio apartment and watch comedy movies. I never aspired to anything more. I didn't value life, I thought it was something you were just born with. Some are born luckier, others sadder. I never thought I would become someone. I just wanted a simple, peaceful life without worries and stress. Without getting involved with a job or a business or a college. A normal life, where you get home after work, eat, watch a movie and go to bed only to do it all over again the next day.

  
 “I had all these things before I was a driver on this car. I had businesses, money, cars, a beautiful wife, anything a mortal could want. I was someone... Now nobody would recognize me on the street anymore... I was a famous boxer until I injured my shoulder and it ruined my whole career... My wife left for someone else, I lost my money at the casino and the moneylenders took the rest. I destroyed the cars to heal my anger and everything became a ruin... I have more debts than my life is worth..." he said in tears and accelerated harder, wiping his eyes without looking at the road.

  
"I have chosen a place for us tonight. A bridgehead. It's far enough away that the ambulance won't make it in time if we miraculously survive. We still have about 15 minutes to go." - I was speechless when I heard these words.

  
15 minutes to convince him that life is worth living... What to say to a man who has already had everything and it's too late to try again. He looked to be about 60 years old. It was like a deadly riddle.... A correct answer would have saved two lives and a wrong one would have condemned us to a painful suicide among the metal scraps of a contorted car. I never imagined that this was how I would die, and already I could feel the sofa fabric seats squeezing me in their eternally suffocating embrace. Suddenly the car became smaller and the nausea made me gag. There were no blocks outside and the lights were the only witnesses to this tragedy. I couldn't die...I was only 29...a lifetime ahead. It couldn't end like this...

  
"I want to see another sunrise..." - I said, after thinking better. "I'm sure you'd like to see one too... the last sunrise... Let's stop and see it together..." - I thought I could buy myself a few more hours, because the sun wouldn't get up until about 8 and it was now almost 1 in the morning.

  
DRIVER: "I've seen hundreds of sunrises and sunsets in this life. I saw the stars in the sky, dancing in the night. Comets, galaxies... what absolute beauty. Too bad you're young, but I believe that what is beyond death is much more beautiful. Someone is going to looks for us through a telescope soon."

One sentence would have made the difference between life and death and at the end of the street I could see little lights floating above an arched bridge. I think the old man was generous with 15 minutes... If I strangled him behind the wheel he would lose control and that's where we'd end up. I was wracking my brain for any ideas and realized I didn't want to die. The old man had a whole day to change his mind... he probably took a few dozen people and nothing convinced him... And now I had to find something... Everything seemed to make sense. As if even a beetle on the grass would have made me value life... but for someone who has lost everything, it wouldn't have mattered...  
I could see him looking at me through the rearview mirror and I felt him gently brake the car. Now I was no longer driving at who knows how many kilometers per hour, it was only about 50-60. It gave me time to think...

  
"If you are destined to die another day, you hurry fate and we do not die. What happens? What will you do if you fail and you can't do it again?”

  
DRIVER: "That's why I'm going to make sure when we get to the bridge that I accelerate to the maximum..."

  
“Well what if you live by a miracle? Don't you think it's easier to take your life the other way? In a way where you're going to be 100% sure you're going to die, beyond a shadow of a doubt?”

  
It seemed to work. I made him think and the man actually stopped the car. I think I escaped. The wheels were turning in his head and I felt like the weight of an elephant was lifted off my shoulders. The chairs that were going to be my cages now let me lie in them like the most comfortable armchair on earth. I was going to see a new day...

  
DRIVER: "You're right..." - said the old man, looking for something on the phone. "We'd better jump in the lake..."

  
That was the moment when I thought of taking his life for the first time... but I didn't have the mental strength and the old man speed off. Happy and laughing that I found a better alternative... I created my own hell. If I got into that lake, I would not get out alive.The car was speeding and I could see he was changing his mind.

  
“You have no power to do this. You want to live.” – I was telling him from behind, trying to convince myself that it would work.

We got to the dock and the car approached the water and the man braked.  
DRIVER: **"What do you want to do before we die?"** – he asked now, in a whispered and muffled voice. He was looking for any reason to stop... "The water is so calm and the waves move like the heartbeat of the earth..."

  
I looked at all the windows and the passenger door and decided to try one last time to save us. The car hummed quietly and I could only imagine what would follow my answer:  
"I want to end up like you. I want to box, live my life, be as happy as you once were." – I said and, for the first time, a smile appeared on his face.

  
DRIVER: "Those were good times... Too bad they're gone."  
The man accelerated the car to the maximum and I felt the front tilt towards the water and then I fell into the lake. Black cold water started flooding the car immediately and the headlights went out. The darkness was so overwhelming that I didn't know where was up and where was down and the water was around my ankles. The old man watched without moving. Like he was paralyzed.... I wouldn't have guessed that a sinking car would take so long. I had time to think about everything... How ridiculous it was that I wanted to call my ex as my last wish... Now I would have wished for anything else...

  
The water was up to his waist and the old man looked like he was starting to panic.  
The terrible darkness and the smell of the water full of fish made me dizzy. The adrenaline I had made me punch and kick the window. Nothing was working and the water was almost up to my neck. The deeper I went, the less likely I was to swim to the surface on a single breath.

  
DRIVER: "You're hitting for nothing. The pressure is too great to break the window." – I snapped at him, pouring out my anger, but the driver seemed to have changed his mind. "Wait for it to fill with water and then crank the window down..."

  
I felt for the crank with my hand and sure enough, it was there. I braced myself and started turning it. The water was rushing into the car and I took a last breath and then pushed myself to the surface. The black and cold abyss engulfed me, I was ascending as fast as I could but I could feel my lungs tightening and the air running out. I was praying to whatever god there is to give me a little more air all the way up. I could already see the lights of the dock as if through a fog. My eyes were freezing in the cold water but I refused to close them. The last air bubbles rose up with a faint sound and my lungs were compressing like a pressurized soda can. A little more, a little more and I blew all the air out coming to the surface.

  
There were already ambulances on the shore, a boat was on the lake, with firefighters diving in the water. They pulled me to the shore. I was anxiously waiting to see if driver made it...until a cop came up to me.

  
POLICE OFFICER: "What brand was the car?" How did you escape?”  
I told him the make of the car and then asked him about driver.  
POLICEMAN:"This car has electric front-seat windows."
