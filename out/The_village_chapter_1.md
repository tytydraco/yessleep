I........'sighs' i dont know what i got myself into back there, and honestly I'm surprised i managed to escape without missing a limb. I survived yes, but with psychological wounds that cant be healed.

''laughs desperately'' And trust me when i say I've been trough lot of weird shit over the years. But....I've seen things- things that are worth being buried deep into the ground than being legends because how twisted they are.

but i need to share it, i want people to open they're eyes, sure this whole continent is filled with magic, legends, wars and evil. Yet there are things that i wish....that i wish would never exist, and legends that at first seemed only as things to scare kids, now being far too real in my eyes.

never thought something like would have happened and......oh right, i haven't introduced my self did i?

''dry chuckle''

Names... Nick, Nick Wenderlive, I'm 34 now , and........''pauses'' and my whole life i was working in special group specifically made to hunt down things, things that somehow found they're way to this world where they don't belong.

And i don't mean like we were mercenaries, tho i understand people who mistakes us for them, unlike them this was far more dangerous job, but also job where we could drown in money, mainly because the one who owns this whole job is a close friend of the queen.

so lets just say i am.....or i was a monster hunter, call it whatever you fucking want. But right now? I'm nothing more but a common guy working in nearby tavern. I hate that job, its not for me....but i rather be doing this than risk my neck to similar situation again.

still i don't feel safe around here, not even among other people, not even at my own fucking house. And its not because I'm afraid of some monster sneaking up on me during my sleep. No.....No......I'm afraid of him, i wont say his name because he doesn't have any real one and the one everybody uses just brings a bad luck.

''looks around my room for a moment,, I'm sorry, i had to look around for a moment, even thinking about him brings me chills.

Even now i feel his pressence, everywhere i go, and i don't even see him, god i haven't seen him for 2 goddamn years, but its like he left mark on my soul, an mark that i feel inside and around me everywhere i go.

And when i start to talk in slightest about it, people either avoid me, shush me or just laughs at me for believing in children stories.

''slams the table hard''

but i swear on everything that i seen him, i felt him!! i seen his hellish mask, always bearing that fucking smile, and those black eye holes on the mask where everything gets lost, its.........''takes a deep breath trying to calm my self down''

no, its pointless, if you don't belive me then so be it, what i will do now is write what exactly happend back there, because......I'm done holding it inside me

''sighs''

during my time with my group of fellow hunters, we were able to withstand any obstacles over the years, We were 6, First there was me, Then the leader of our group Samael who was the most skilled and most experienced among us.

then there was Stella, smart, beautiful and deadly, 

Marcus who always enjoyed hearing himself talk, not missing a single chance to brag about how he killed this and that.

David who back then was the youngest and less experienced guy among us, even after weeks we still called him a new guy.

and Erica who is slightly older than me.

Most of the time we got jobs to travel to places mostly isolated from biggest cities and forts, so just villages and small towns and deep woods, that were terrorized by those very monsters.

And no, I'm not speaking about other things that looks like monsters, because they are not. Those things are far well known and even if they are dangerous, they acted purely on their animal instincts and lived among us for centuries, but those we had the chance to meet, they killed, hunted, purely for their own twisted entertainment.

And like any other day we got a contract to check out one of the bigger village far away from any bigger town covered by endless woods, that had problem with missing people and killed animals around they're area.

As one of the best teams, us 6 were send there to find out what exactly was going on, and heh.....the pay was way bigger than the average pay we get for each job.

But i should have turned around instantly after entering these woods, leading to the village, because there was something wrong, something extremely wrong. It was just too quiet, our horses, bred to be more immune towards the fear were extremely nervous that time. The air so dead, so......cold.

''But after some time traveling, the sun was setting down and the village was still far from us, so it was settled that we spend the night here, its not like we were doing this for the first time anyway, we prepared the campfire, secured our horses so they don't escape or anything, our sword and weapons ready in case somebody tries to break the party''

and there we sat around the campfire, my sword and helmet close to me, and nothing weird was happening so far tho the strange feeling was still lingering, And that's when over time, few crows gathered around in the trees, and then more.....and more''

" I couldn't help but be fixated at the crows blending perfectly with the darkness. Their clever, birdlike eyes were utterly fixed on us below, sitting around the campfire''

'' It was already too dark, the fire covering only but a few meters of distance, bringing at least little light to the places utterly consumed by the darkness of the woods''

'' And to be honest, i would lie if i said i haven't been staring in the darkness afterwards without even blinking, i haven't seen anything in there, not that i expected anything to see. But i was probably the only one so far to feel something is different around this place''

'' But a laugh brought me back to my senses, loud and throaty''

Hah! you should have seen how that ugly freak lunged at me in frustration, only to get its head cut off mid strike, god it felt so good, Guy was dumb as shit!

'' ugh it was Marcus starting again with one of his stories of how he easily took down one of the Tree stalkers, a story we heard for million fucking time already. And yet he always talks about it like it happens just yesterday''

'' And sure enough one person from the group made sure that he knows it''

Heh right- and I'm pretty sure half of that was made up just to impress Ladies at local taverns huh ? No one's actually seen you do any of this Marcus. '' she said with teasing laugh'' Cant blame you tho, it must be sooo hard trying to impress someone when the only thing you've ever done, was yelling like a little girl when huge fucking spider crawled on your back, it wasn't even poisonous!

oh ha ha'' Marcus clap slowly and sarcastically'' very funny Stella

'' The others laughed as well, well everybody expect our leader Samael, keeping his stern gaze fixed on the surroundings, watching it intensely just like the crows, he felt something ain't quite right too''

'' As the laughter laid down, Stella sit closer to me, watching the group chatting before looking at me''

You seem really tensed Nick, since the time we got here you're always so cautios just like Samael. '' she said curiously''

well cant you feel it? this whole place just feels wrong, the air around these woods is cold and heavy and i cant remember a single time i heard any bird here, or any animal '' i answered her''

''Stella looked up at the crows still siting at the trees, watching, it almost looks like they were waiting for something''

I noticed these crows too, clever creatures but they ain't night birds and they usually gather like that only when they see wounded animal, and still they are keeping them self safely in air.

'' I nodded, understanding what she means''

What are you two love birds mumbling with each other over there? '' Erica mumbled''

'' those words caught me slightly of guard and i could hear Marcus slightly snickering and David was just, well he was just sitting there''

Don't tell me guys you actually don't find this place extremely wrong in some ways?

'' the others looked around or stooped for moment, looking around the endless dark before they're gazes falls upon the crows, sitting silently at the trees blending perfectly with the night''

yeaah i mean i felt something is wrong too but wasn't sure if its just me'' Marcus looked at them whith curious but wary gaze'' I take this isn't natural crow behavior is it?

'' the youngest, David looked at him and spoke in almost whisper''

No, it really isn't, crows are smart but this is just, i haven't seen anything like it.

could be like....i dont know, maybe they are waiting on something? or perhaps they are....''Erica silenced trying to find the right words''

studying us '' Stella finished her sentence''

studying us? that's kinda bullshit don't you think? ''Marcus said with small chuckle'' what do you think boss? '' he said towards samael who listened and stared at the crows as well, all of us turned towards him and without even looking at us he spoken deeply''

Clever little birds they are, they sometimes can act like that, for what purpose i do not know, but around these parts its told they can sense dead before it arrives.

'' those words send slight chills down our spines, but as if the crows heard or understand, all of them, at once flew away high into the skies, they're feather falling slowly down, i....i dont know even now if it was from fear, or from something''

'' this caught me and everybody else from guard but before we could say or do anything, the horses suddenly started to panic out of sheer fear, shaking they're heads and standing on they're back limbs only for their hooves to hit the ground, Erica and David quickly went over to them trying to calm them down, but all of us quickly stood up, taking our weapons, holding them firmly. They never usually panicked like that but this was pure terror for them, that means something dangerous was there, lurking in the dark and the horses were the first one to feel it''

''they managed to calm our horses down but after that they stood still, they're eyes fixed on the darkness in front of us. Nobody dared to make sound as we tried to hear anything, footsteps, stick cracks, growls or anything. But its as if the whole woods went silent. Samael stepped slightly closer, his weapon ready, he took deep silent breath before turning at us and gesturing to light our torches, and so we did''

'' we raised our torches, we normaly would do defense circle, but the horse gazes were still utterly fixed towards the darkness in front of them''

growls '' that's what came after, but not any sinister or monstrosity growls, it was normal, coming from a wolfs not too far from us, i don't think i need to explain that they usually growl when feeling threaten or trying to intimidate somebody''

'' We tensed even more going into battle stances, but the growls echoing trough woods now turned into whimpers, first silent, then utterly louder, they didn't seemed just scared, they felt terrified''

'' that's when we heard small pairs of footsteps charging towards us and we were ready to swing but Samael raised his hand up, and when that happens, pair of wolves quickly passed and jumped around us, not attacking us, but desperately trying to get them self out of there as possible''

'' we looked behind us as the wolfs slowly vanishing from sight, we looked at each other confused, even the horsed didn't moved, they still continued to stare, and that's when Samael spoke up deeply, slightly concerned''

It weren't the wolfs they feared, and the wolfs, they feared something else. Something we cant see.

'' even now this was terrifying, at first we thought the danger the horses spotted were just a wolfs, and that the aggressive behavior was towards us. But we were wrong, the wolfs and the horses were terrified by something else''

''by something, that i fear.....even now''
