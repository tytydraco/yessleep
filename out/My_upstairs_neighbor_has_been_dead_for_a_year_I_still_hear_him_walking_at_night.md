Let me start by saying: I live alone. Top-floor apartment. Quiet building. Old, but not creepy-old. I moved in six months ago after a divorce and a long series of personal screw-ups. I needed quiet. Solitude. I thought I’d found it.

The building is one of those 1940s brick walk-ups — three floors, six units. My place is Unit 5, top right corner. I knew from the lease that Unit 6, the one directly next to mine, had been empty since last year. The previous tenant, an elderly man named Mr. Harlan, had passed away in his sleep. Nothing dramatic. Natural causes.

He was apparently a quiet, odd guy. No family. Paid his rent on time. The property manager said it was a while before anyone noticed he was gone. When they found him, he’d already started to decompose. They gutted and sanitized the place after that, but no one had rented it since.

Anyway, that’s not my unit. Mine was clean, comfortable. I didn’t think much of it until about a month ago.

That’s when I started hearing footsteps above me.

At first, I assumed it was just building noise. Pipes, maybe. But they were too… rhythmic. Too human. They sounded exactly like someone pacing, back and forth, across the living room — right above mine. Always between 1 and 3 a.m. Every. Night.

I asked the property manager, Amy, if someone had finally moved into Unit 6.

“Nope,” she said. “Still vacant. Why?”

I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to sound crazy. But it only got worse from there.

A week later, I started hearing knocking.

Just three knocks. Always at the same spot — near the shared wall in my bedroom. First night, it woke me up at 2:13 a.m. Knock. Knock. Knock.

I sat up, heart hammering, waiting for a fourth. It never came.

I checked the hallway. Nothing.

Second night: same time. Same three knocks.

By the fourth night, I left my phone recording audio. I needed proof that I wasn’t losing my mind. When I played it back the next morning, I nearly threw up.

The knocking was there. Clear as day.

But so was something else.

A voice. Low, hoarse, and so close to the mic it made the speaker crackle. Just one sentence, whispered like it came from inches away:

“It’s not empty.”

I moved out of my bedroom after that. Started sleeping on the couch in the living room, keeping all the lights on.

I told myself it was a trick. A hoax. Maybe someone was squatting up there. Maybe a homeless guy slipped in after hours. Maybe kids were pulling some weird prank.

I went back to Amy and told her everything. She didn’t laugh. In fact, she got real quiet. Said she’d look into it and get back to me.

That night, the pacing started again — but this time, it didn’t stop at the ceiling.

It came down the stairs.

I swear to God, I heard someone step down the stairwell toward my door. Not running. Not sneaking. Just that slow, deliberate shuffle of a man with all the time in the world.

The footsteps stopped right outside my apartment.

Then the doorknob turned.

It didn’t rattle. It turned, like someone had the key.

But the deadbolt was still on. Whoever it was didn’t get in. Not that night.

The next morning, I noticed something wedged in the doorframe. A slip of old paper, yellowed at the edges like it had been wet once and dried out. No handwriting. Just a charcoal rubbing, like someone had taken a coin to paper over a surface.

It was my apartment number — “5” — etched from a metal placard. And underneath, in what looked like smudged ash or soot:

“He hears you.”

I broke my lease that same day. Paid the fee, packed everything in 24 hours, and crashed on a friend’s couch.

Amy never called me back. She stopped responding altogether.

Two days ago, I drove back to grab a few things I’d left behind. When I pulled into the lot, something caught my eye.

The window to Unit 6 was open.

Not broken — just open, like someone had opened it from the inside. Curtain fluttering in the breeze.

I climbed the steps. The door to Unit 6 was closed, but there was a smell. That same smell from when they found Harlan. I never smelled it before — but you *know* when you smell death. It’s not something you forget.

The mail slot on the door was shut with tape. But someone had torn it open.

Inside, in the shadows of the empty hallway, something moved. Just a shape — slow, head low, pacing like it was remembering the place. Like it never left.

I didn’t stay. I got in my car, and I drove until I couldn’t see the building anymore.

Last night, I got a voicemail.

Blocked number. A man’s voice. Raspy. Familiar.

Just five words, spoken like a promise:

“You shouldn’t have heard me.”
