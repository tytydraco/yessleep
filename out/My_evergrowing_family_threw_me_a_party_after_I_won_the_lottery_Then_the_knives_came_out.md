“Family is everything. Always remember that, Jordan.” Those were the words spoken by my parents on my 10th birthday, and they’ve echoed in my mind ever since. Now, as an adult with a psychology degree, struggling to make ends meet, those words felt more like a cruel joke. 



One Monday afternoon, in a moment of desperation, I stopped at a gas station and spent $20 on a scratch off ticket. When I got home and scratched it, my heart nearly stopped. Two million dollars. The numbers stared back at me. Ecstatic, I called my parents to share the news. Their joy matched mine, and they immediately started making plans for a huge family celebration. In retrospect, making that call was the worst mistake I’ve ever made. I should’ve kept it to myself. What happened next left me scarred forever.



It took weeks before I finally deposited the lump-sum check into my account. But as soon as it cleared, the knives came out. 



They threw me a grand dinner party to celebrate, with my parents, and five rough looking cousins I’d never met showed up. Becoming an instant millionaire and spending the night celebrating with loved ones felt like the perfect ending to my story. The table was overflowing with all kinds of food and drinks, but it was the wine that caught my attention. On a good day, I could easily down two to four bottles.



Unfortunately, the joy didn’t last. Things began to take a turn for the worse.



Almost everyone bombarded me with questions—demanding my bank account details and prying into what I planned to do with the money. They were relentless in their curiosity about my future, but I refused to share anything and stepped outside to clear my head. The wine I’d been drinking left a sour taste in my mouth, and a wave of nausea hit me. Stumbling onto the porch, I collapsed and blacked out. 



When I woke up hours later, I groggily got to my feet and went back into the farmhouse. Something was off. The house was shrouded in darkness, and no one was around. It was as if everyone had vanished without a trace. That was when the nightmare truly began.



When lights flickered back on, everyone was seated around the dinner table, staring daggers at me. My mother, Grace, launched into a tirade about how the farmhouse was supposedly days away from foreclosure. But that was a lie, since we paid it off last year through a loan. My father, Mark, pressed me to hand over my bank account details, claiming he was behind on child-support payments to his ex-wives. I held my ground, firmly refusing. My five rough-looking cousins sat in silence; their eyes fixed on me with unsettling intensity. Disgusted, I expressed my deep disappointment to my family and turned to leave, heading for my car.



They jumped on me before I could reach it. Someone jammed a needle into my arm, injecting me with an unknown substance. I blacked out, and when I woke up, it was midnight. I was inside a small-town jail cell, surrounded by two dead cops, with blood coating my hands. I looked up and saw my family members snapping pictures of me from outside the cell. 



Lord almighty, I’d been framed for murder by my own family. I screamed at them to let me out, insisting their plan would fall apart because of the surveillance cameras in the station. But my cousins only laughed, casually pointing out that the jail was old, and the cameras hadn’t worked in years. I froze at the revelation.



They swung open the cell door and advised me to run, cause as of today, I was officially a cop killer whose luck had run out. They bolted out of the police station. 



I stepped out of the cell and examined the bodies of the dead cops. Their throats had been slashed so deeply that the cuts exposed bone. I bolted out of the station after hearing sirens, but I was jumped again, this time by the five rough-looking cousins I’d never met. They injected me with an unknown substance and I passed out.



I jolted awake inside the town’s small church, lying close to the altar. The altar was smeared with flesh and blood. Turning around, I gasped at the rows of dead parishioners sitting in their seats, butchered. My heart pounded so hard it felt unbearable; was this some twisted nightmare, or had I truly killed these people, like the two cops at the station? I didn’t have the answers yet, but I was prepared to fight tooth and nail to uncover the truth.



I stepped out of the church and came face-to-face with a crowd in hooded white robes, their flashlights pointed at me. I considered running into the woods, since the church was deep in a secluded, forested area, but I wasn’t sure I could outrun them. My head throbbed, dizziness blurred my vision, and I felt completely drained, both physically and mentally. That’s when it hit me—what kind of drug had my family injected me with?



I dashed into the woods, glancing back to see if anyone was following. Reaching a clearing, I paused to catch my breath, waiting for the hooded figures to appear, but no one did. I spotted a small shed nearby and slipped inside, taking the chance to relive myself. Just as I finished, a powerful force slammed into the shed, flipping me upside down. It didn’t sound like any animal; it was more like a truck crashing into it. I scrambled out just as the shed tipped over. Before I could steady myself, conjoined twins rushed up to me with a taser, and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground, paralyzed, falling into unconsciousness, again.



I woke up on a stretcher in a decaying medical clinic, a middle-aged nurse with rotten teeth standing beside me. When I asked how I’d ended up here, she stayed silent, her gaze more focused on my pockets than my wellbeing. I got off the stretcher, warning her to stay away from me. She just stared at me, then whispered something chilling—she knew about the lottery I’d cashed recently. And that’s when it hit me: my family, the hooded figures in the forest, conjoined twins in the clearing and now this nurse— they were all after my money.



“I won it! It’s mine!” I shouted, struggling to stay upright. She laughed, exposing her decaying teeth, and murmured a few words that sent a wave of dread through me.



“Family is everything, Jordan,” she whispered, stepping closer to me. But she wasn’t family. I was certain she was bluffing. I turned and bolted out of the clinic, stumbling and nearly collapsing as I crashed to the ground, only to find myself surrounded by smirking bare-chested rednecks aiming their rifles at me. My vision wasn't getting any better and I knew I couldn’t fight them. I let them drag me into the back of their truck. 



The truck drove to the old circus grounds, long shut down over rumors of gambling and human trafficking. 



When I came to my senses, I was on a large wooden stage, staring at my seated parents, the hooded figures, my rough-looking cousins, the nurse with rotten teeth, the conjoined twins who’d tased me in the clearing, and the bare-chested rednecks, all watching me. I stood there on stage, frightened and in tears. How can my parents do this to me? I’ve always had a good relationship with them. At that moment, I wished more than anything to go back in time, to keep my winnings a secret. 



But now, it was too late.



My mother, Grace, addressed me directly. “Wire us the money, Jordan. And I promise you this will all be over soon.”



I stepped to the edge of the stage, my glare cutting through her like a blade. “You framed me for murders I didn’t commit. You’ve destroyed my life.”



They rose from their seats, tambourines in hand, playing with an unsettling enthusiasm. My parents had never touched an instrument in their lives, and I wasn’t about to stick around to find out what this sudden performance was all about. Without hesitation, I leapt off the stage and bolted toward the big top—a massive tent draped in bold red and white stripes. 



Inside, I found piles of dolls and rows of eerily still mannequins. Heart pounding, I crouched among the clutter, hoping to stay hidden. But I was wrong. Some of the mannequins weren’t lifeless props. Their eyes snapped open, glinting with life, and before I could react, they lunged at me, dragging me out of the tent toward the animal pens behind a row of ornate fences.



I screamed and struggled to fight them off. The distant sound of tambourine music still echoed through the air. They dragged me to a pen where a sleeping lion lay and shoved me inside, slamming the gate shut behind me. I looked up at the lion as it let out a low groan in its sleep, its massive body beginning to stir. One of the men, dressed unnervingly like a mannequin, pulled out an iPad, and shoved it through the pen. 



“Direct me to your website’s bank account,” he demanded.



I shook my head firmly. “No.” 



The lion’s eyes fluttered open, staring into my eyes. Holly mother, I was as good as dead.



The beast rose to its feet, towering over me, and leaned in close. Its rough tongue swiped across my sweaty face. I squeezed my teary eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable, but then an odd realization cut through my fear: the circus grounds had been shut down for decades. What were animals still doing here, locked inside cages? And then I wondered? Was any of this even real to begin with? The two dead cops. The lifeless parishioners. The hooded figures in white robes. The bare-chested rednecks. The nurse with rotten teeth. The conjoined twins who had tased me in the forest. And now this circus with caged animals that were closed decades ago. I knew I had been drugged, but maybe it was much worse than that? 



My eyes cracked open, meeting the lion’s unyielding gaze. It tilted its head, then sat back on its haunches. Before I could make sense of it, I noticed something that made my breath catch—a gold necklace hanging around the lion’s neck. It looked strikingly similar to the one my mother, Grace, always wore. What an odd coincidence, I thought. But I couldn’t shake the feeling. I had to be sure. So, I asked a crazy question.



“Mom? Is that…you?”



The men in mannequin costumes hissed at each other in hushed tones, their frustration clearly visible. The lion became irritated, slamming itself against the pen. 



The men rushed into the pen, restraining me. One of them jabbed a needle into my arm. The world around me dissolved into darkness—again.



I woke up, naked, lying in the middle of the street under the cover of night. My mother, Grace, sat eerily still beside me, her eyes closed as if in deep slumber. I staggered to my feet and her eyes cracked open, locking into mine. Her lips parted slowly, unnervingly wide, as she pushed her hand into her mouth. When she pulled it back out, a writhing snake dangled from her grasp. 



I screamed and bolted down the street, glancing over my shoulder to see if she followed. I reached a fence and scrambled over it and ran into the woods until the outline of our farmhouse emerged through the darkness. I ran into the main house, climbed up the stairs, found some clothes in my room and suited up.  



As I descended the stairs toward the living room, I saw my parents, plus everyone else, seated at the dinner table, each with a cup of coffee in hand, whispering in hushed tones. I joined them in silence, seething, but powerless against my predicament. 



Suddenly, they slowly turned their necks toward me, and began speaking in an eerie, guttural language. And that’s when I remembered. **Witchcraft**. My eyes widened as a memory surfaced—my grandmother had dabbled in witchcraft during her teenage years and surely had passed her teachings to my mother. Their words grew louder, dripping with malice. My body betrayed me, blood began to trickle down my scalp, seeped from my nose and poured from my mouth. 



And then I wondered? What if this wasn’t real as I suspected? What if I was a puppet in their dark ritual, controlled through witchcraft?



There was no time to dwell on the thought. My body lifted off the floor, floating helplessly in the air.



“I’ll give you what you want. Please, stop! It’s all yours!” I cried out.



I dropped like a stone on the floor, grimacing in pain, looking up, seeing their faces twisted in triumph. Their joy was evident, they’d finally got what they asked for. But they couldn’t be more wrong. I staggered to my feet with a devious scheme in mind. 



One of my cousins slid a note and pen across the table, expecting me to scrawl my bank information. Instead, I gripped the pen and lunged forward, driving it straight into my mother’s eye. The makeup of the room began to change. The walls shimmered and warped, pulsing as if alive. My family screamed, their voices deafening, as one by one, they vanished from their chairs.



I woke up in the bathroom, my mother lying beside me, unconscious. I jolted upright and scanned the room. My God! My own mother, with the help of my family, had practiced witchcraft on me, to get after the lottery money I’d won. I walked out of the bathroom, slipped into the hall and started hearing joyful voices. 



I looked down and saw my parents seated at the dinner table, plus, the nurse with decaying teeth, the rough-looking cousins, the conjoined twins who’d tased me, the bare-chested rednecks, and a small crowd of people cloaked in white robes.



I knew there was no way out of here without a bruising fight, but I had no intention of hurting anyone. Desperate for a moment to think, I slipped into hiding in the library—a small adjacent room. I scanned the shelves, crammed with books and family albums. 



My eyes fell on one of the albums, and curiosity got the better of me. I opened it, flipping through the pages. My heart sank. Staring back at me were faces I recognized. 



On one page, I saw a photo of myself as a child, standing outside a farmhouse beside a teenage girl with decaying teeth. She bore an uncanny resemblance to the nurse with the rotten smile. 



I turned the page, and my stomach churned. The conjoined twins who had tased me were in another photograph, standing next to me and my mother, as if they were a happy couple inside a mechanic shop. 



And it didn’t stop there.  



The town’s sheriff. The two deputies. Even the people in white robes from the dinner table. 



And then, there was the last page. 



What I saw made me stumble backward, collapsing onto the floor. Recoiling in complete horror and disgust.



It was a photo of me as a newborn.



I was cradled in my mother’s arms, surrounded by familiar faces. The younger conjoined twins stood proudly at her side. My father, Mark, was there too, along with a crowd of rough-looking teenage cousins and everyone else(sheriff, deputies, parishioners, bare-chested teenagers and younger faces I recognized at the dinner table wearing white robes). 



There was a scribble at the bottom of the page:



*Jordan Summers. Welcome to our ever-growing family.*



Silence tore me apart, then the tears came. The horrifying truth settled in—I had been born into some twisted, incestuous, religious, redneck nightmare of a family.



There was no time to waste. I had to escape. I opened the door cautiously, but the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs froze me in place. They were heading to the bathroom to check on my mother. I closed the door and rushed to the window. 



Outside, an unattended horse stood near the farmhouse entrance, its reins slack. I pushed the window open and slipped onto the roof. The drop below was steep.



I heard a commotion inside—they had found my mother.



I jumped. Pain shot through me as I landed hard on the ground, my leg snapping under the impact. I dragged myself to the horse, hauled myself into the saddle, and urged it into a gallop. Through the dense woods, I rode for what felt like hours, not caring where I was going, as long as it was far away from the farmhouse.



I emerged onto a road and followed it until I reached a bus station in the next town. With the last few dollars in my wallet, I bought a one-way ticket to Oregon. 



Once there, I started over. I changed my name, my social security number, and opened a new bank account with my hidden wealth. I dyed my hair pink and started wearing nose-rings. I found a small, cheap apartment and lived like a ghost, severing all ties to my family and former life. 



I kept my mouth shut and avoided anyone who might pry into my past.



But life had other plans.



I eventually found love, and within a year, Trinity and I were married. We bought a small farmhouse, miles away from the city.



My life was better. Peaceful. But the past never truly left me.



I was scarred forever.



And to those of you wondering if I ever told my wife about the lottery I had won.



A secret is a secret. 



I kept it to myself.
