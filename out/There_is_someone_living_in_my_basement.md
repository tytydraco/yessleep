I never go down to my basement. Not because it’s scary, or because I’m lazy, but because I simply don’t have a reason to. I live alone in a small house that’s way too big for me, and the basement has always just been a storage space. Boxes of old clothes, holiday decorations, junk I don’t need but can’t bring myself to throw away—it’s all down there, untouched for years.

At least, that’s what I thought.

It started with little things. Things I could explain away. The basement door would be unlocked when I was sure I had locked it. A faint creaking sound at night, like wood shifting under weight. A weird smell drifting up through the vents—a mix of sweat and something else, something foul.

I told myself it was just the house settling, or maybe my memory playing tricks on me. I had lived here for five years, and nothing weird had ever happened before. Why would it start now?

Then, one night, I woke up to a sound that I couldn’t ignore.

Footsteps.

Not the soft creaks of an old house shifting. Not the scurrying of mice in the walls. Real, deliberate footsteps. Slow. Careful. Coming from below me.

I sat up in bed, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. I stared at the bedroom door, listening. The footsteps continued for a few seconds, then stopped.

Silence.

I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and crept out of bed. The house was dark, too dark, and the air felt… wrong. Heavy. Like something was watching me.

When I reached the basement door, I hesitated. It was closed, just like always. But this time, I noticed something I hadn’t before. The doorknob was dirty. Greasy fingerprints smeared across the brass, as if someone had grabbed it with sweaty, grimy hands.

I swallowed hard.

I locked this door. I know I did.

Taking a deep breath, I slowly turned the knob. It wasn’t locked. The door swung open with a groan, revealing the black void of the basement stairs. My phone’s flashlight barely cut through the darkness.

I didn’t want to go down there. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to run, to pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But I had to know.

Step by step, I descended.

The basement was just as I remembered—cold, cluttered, the air thick with dust. But something felt off . My skin prickled. The tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

Then, my light landed on something that shouldn’t have been there.

A sleeping bag.

Old, stained, crumpled in the far corner, half-hidden behind boxes. Beside it, a pile of empty food wrappers, a few plastic bottles filled with murky liquid. The smell hit me all at once—rotting food, sweat, something worse.

Someone had been living down here.

Panic surged through me. I spun around, phone light darting across the basement. My breath came in short, sharp gasps.

Then—movement.

A figure lunged from the shadows.

I barely had time to react before I was slammed against the wall. My phone flew from my hand, the flashlight spinning wildly, casting twisted shadows across the room.

I couldn’t see them clearly—just a hunched shape, reeking of filth and sweat, their breath ragged and wet.

They didn’t speak.

They just laughed .

A guttural, broken sound, like someone choking on their own breath.

I fought, kicking, shoving, but they were strong. Fingers wrapped around my throat, squeezing. My vision blurred.

Then—light.

Bright, blinding.

My phone had landed face-up, its flashlight beaming straight into my attacker’s face.

For the first time, I saw them.

Gaunt, sunken eyes. Greasy, matted hair. A face so thin it barely looked human. Lips pulled back in a grin too wide, teeth yellow and jagged.

But the worst part?

I knew this face.

It was me.

Or at least, it looked like me.

Before my mind could process it, the figure shrieked and scrambled back, scuttling into the darkness like a cockroach.

I didn’t wait. I ran. Up the stairs, through the door, slamming it shut behind me. I locked it. Pushed a chair in front of it. Then I ran to my bedroom, grabbed my keys and phone, and bolted out of the house.

I called the police from my car, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone.

When they arrived, they found nothing.

No sleeping bag. No food wrappers. No bottles.

No one.

But the basement smelled. The cops noticed it too. That awful, rotting stench.

They searched the whole house. Nothing was stolen, no signs of forced entry.

They told me it was probably a squatter. That maybe I had interrupted them, and they fled through some hidden exit.

But I know what I saw.

I know who I saw.

I haven’t been back to the house since. I don’t think I ever will.

Because somewhere, in the darkness of that basement, something is still down there.

And it looks just like me.
