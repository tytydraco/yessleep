*“Draco Byssus Torta.  I like to describe them as the Manson family, if Charlie was considerably more organized.  Their favorite hobbies are disembowling animals and setting trash fires, always with their calling card: the image of a tower with a dragon wrapped around it.  They say they’re possessed, that the Nephilim make them do it.  Containing Draco Byssus Torta is like fighting the Hydra in Greek mythology - we arrest one, and three more spring up in their place.”*

Miranda liked to lie on the internet.  

It was 2002, the beginning of our sophomore year, and every teen-ager in America was obsessed with LiveJournal.

My LiveJournal filled a void in me I hadn’t known existed.  I’d express my opinions about the war in Afghanistan, stem cell research, and how I would’ve voted for Ralph Nader in the 2000 election if I were old enough to vote, and people read what I wrote and responded to it.  I communicated with other kids who were obsessed with Pokemon and geeked out over Lord of the Rings.  I even became internet-friends with a couple boys my age who’d come out of the closet as openly gay.  Baby steps.  

A LiveJournal friend, KillaHawke15, who I talked to on AIM, told me about another LiveJournal user whose father was a higher-up in the CIA.  This girl claimed to be a cadet at a special high school for future spies.  She hinted at secret knowledge of government conspiracies, and told stories about posing as a decoy to trap sex traffickers and expose terrorist cells.  

*She’s not lying*, KillaHawke15 typed.  *She told us the Enron guys were gonna get arrested like a month before it happened*.

*What’s her name?* I asked.

*CosmicBlonde87.*

I found the page myself, then called Miranda.  She was CosmicBlonde87; she’d used the same handle for her old Pokemon Blue Version.  The LiveJournal page - on which she described a mission to infiltrate a sale of Uranium by the Taliban to the Iraqi Republican Guard - clearly showcased her writing style.  

Miranda just laughed.  “You caught me.  Are you going to tattle?”

“What?  No,” I stammered.  “Why are you pretending you’re Kim Possible?  And how did you know about Enron?”

Miranda laughed again.  “I watch CNN, Schuyler.  And I read the papers.  Not just the part about Winona getting busted, the entire thing.  Like, the financial pages.  Anyone who read the papers could’ve seen the Enron mess coming like a meteor.”

“Oh,” I responded, feeling stupid.  I’d never even heard of Enron until the sordid bankruptcy was on the nightly news.  “So when you said George W. Bush secretly allowed for oil drilling in Roswell and they found alien skeletons…”

“Ohmygod, Schuyler, I lied.”  I could *hear* Miranda rolling her eyes.  “Most of that account is just shit I made up.  The trick is to throw in just the right amount of reality.  If I’m right one time out of, like, ten, people believe anything I say.”

My current self - the nearly 40-year-old adult - would’ve considered a bit more critically how much Miranda enjoyed manipulation and deceit.  But teen-aged me let it go.  When it came to Miranda, I let a lot of things go.  

Miranda and I met September of our sophomore year, on the benches in front of Morrison Preparatory School.  We were reading the same book - Empire Falls by Richard Russo, if you’re curious - and became immediate best friends.  

My family had moved from a small town outside Pittsburgh to Southern California the summer before.  I was immediately slapped in the face by a rough reality: in my new life, I was average.  Back home, I’d been the star of the baseball team.  At Morrison, I sat on the bench, keeping the Gatorade company.  Back home, I earned such good grades with so little effort I’d cultivated a reputation as a genius.  At Morrison, the academically-cutthroat thunderdome, I received my first C.  I’d once hung out with the popular group.  As the new kid at Morrison, I struggled to embed myself into already-established cliques.  

I only knew one other local teenager: Kyle.  

*Kyle*.  My first love, Kyle.  

Kyle lived nearby with his family, and he attended St. Vincent School for Boys.  We’d been cabin-mates at summer baseball camp.  I'd adored Kyle, with his perfectly-tousled auburn hair and crooked smile, who’d do anything for a laugh and couldn’t stand to see anyone in pain.  Then there was that night behind the mess hall, his soft lips on mine, his mouth tasting like chocolate cookies…

Since that summer ended, since our perfect first kiss, Kyle had ignored my e-mails, my AIM messages, my phone calls and hand-written letters.  Before we moved, I e-mailed him one last time.  I told him where we’d be living.  Where I’d be going to school.  Yet again, radio silence.  I was as invisible to Kyle as I was to my new classmates at Morrison Prep. 

Then I met Miranda, and my life changed.  Miranda was beautiful.  She was brilliant - second in our class.  She played the lead in drama club productions, sang solos with the choir, ran track, wrote for the school paper and copyedited the yearbook.  She existed on a plane so high above high school drama it barely registered on her radar - and because of her glowing self-confidence, girls flocked to her like moths to a flame.  A rumor went around that Miranda and I were dating.  We… didn’t deny it.  And suddenly, I was as popular as she was.

\*\*\*\*\*

May of our junior year, Miranda and I got ready together before our friend Brett’s birthday party.  

Miranda was an only child; she lived in an old house in the historic part of town with her widowed grandmother, her father’s mother.  Miranda’s own mother, Christine, died of complications shortly after she’d given birth to Miranda.  Christine had been a painter; her colorful, dramatic work was framed all over the house.  Miranda’s favorite piece, hung in her room, depicted a starkly realistic prison tower with a fantastical dragon wrapped around it.  

She never spoke about her father, and I never asked.

Miranda squealed when I found her in her room.  She jumped up from her desk - she’d been typing something on her computer - announced she had a surprise for me, and rushed out of the room. 

I plopped down into her fat beanbag chair.  A second later, her iMac chirped.  Then again.  And again. I got up to look, thinking Miranda might be receiving AIM messages from Dani, the Morrison senior giving us a ride to the party.  

I was right about AIM, but not Dani.  The messages were from someone with the screen name CoreyBrown86.  

*Coreybrown86: i got ur pics*

*Coreybrown86: i choked it to ur tits*

*Coreybrown86: ur a very bad girl.  detention 2nite.  wear ur school uniform and red panties ;)*

“Schuyler, don’t look at that!”

Miranda pushed me aside and closed the chat window.

“Who is that guy?” I demanded.  “He might be a forty-year-old pervert!”

Miranda smiled mischievously.  “He’s a 46-year-old tax attorney.  And the president of Good Shepherd Church.  His real name’s Bob.  I call him Bugger Bob.”

I gaped.  All those assemblies, all the after-school specials, looped in my head like a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  I saw Miranda, tied up in the trunk of a greasy old Honda.  Miranda, pregnant and sleeping under the freeway overpass.  Miranda, chained in a torture basement, the 46-year-old president of Good Shepherd Church looming over her.

Miranda registered the look on my face and got serious.  “I’m just using him, Schuyler.  I send him pictures, he wires me money.  Money I used for… this!”

She pulled my surprise out of the pocket of her laced-up jeans: two fake IDs.  Good quality fake ID’s.  One with my name, one with hers.  Birth year on both: 1982.  I screeched excitedly, bouncing up and down like a little kid at Disneyland.  I forced myself to bury what I’d learned.  That my best friend was sending nude photos to a middle-aged pedophile.  That instead of doing the right thing and turning him into the authorities, she’d exploited the situation to extort money.  

Adult-me wants to scream at my teen-aged self.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was March of my senior year when I first heard the name Draco Byssus Torta.  I was AIM chatting with Amber, a friend who went to St. Agnes School for Girls.  We’d met in an art class and bonded over our love of Samurai Champloo and Miyazaki films.  

Willow\_Rose924:  Dood you gotta check this out.  Draco Byssus Torta.  There’s a chatroom where a        bunch of guys are going on about it.  

*PA\_Kaonashi020: sounds like the villain in an 80s video game.*

*Willow\_Rose924:  its a secret society!  And they’re like recruiting new members.*

*PA\_Kaonashi020: I call BS.*

All I knew about secret societies I’d learned from The DaVinci Code.  And I knew Amber.  She was a conspiracy theory nut: MK Ultra, aliens built the pyramids, subliminal messaging in breakfast cereal ads.  She’d believe anything presented to her as a hidden truth.  Which, ironically, made her pretty gullible.  

*Willow\_Rose924: this is their website:* [*www.dracobyssustorta.com*](http://www.dracobyssustorta.com)

The website was simple and ugly.  Grey background, title in a large font.  A box in the upper left corner counted page views: 59 of them.  And, below the title, a crude drawing of a tower with a dragon wrapped around it, above a brick of Times New Roman text.

*Allow us to in****t****roduce ourselves.  We live amongst yo****u****, but we are not of you.  We have seen your reality for what it truly is: a f****r****agile, gossamer spider’s web blowing in the winds of the cosmic e****t****ernity.  You are like the blind man chained to the rock: because you see shadows, you think yourse****l****ves wise.  We are the ones who have broken fre****e****.  Come and find us.  And you will be freed.*

*34 children dance just beyond the trees, 32 arms twist in purple leaves.*

*Their pretty golden eyes are filled with tears, black mold grows on 118 ears.*

*Behind on the cliffs there’s pink glowing rays, a smiling sun for only 1 day.* 

*Tell them a secret and they might reveal, reach all the way down until their hands you feel.*

I rolled my eyes and messaged Amber back.

*PA\_Kaonashi020: sounds like a bunch of pretentious douchebags*

*Willow\_Rose924: check out the chatroom.  They think the poem is a clue - like if you figure it out… I don’t know.  Something will happen.  I’ll drop the link!*

I had better things to do with my night.  Like study for the physics test Mr. Kandor promised would be a ball-buster.  But I couldn’t resist copying-and-pasting the long address Amber sent me into my search bar, then clicking ADD.  I found myself dropped into a crude chatroom, engaged in a heated discussion over symbology. 

*WarLord8585: stop obsessing over the colors, dumshit.  Its the numbers.  4 is about the elements.*

*Louie\_Da\_17th: ooh didja ask Jeeves bigshot?*

*TrinityJane123: The Egyptians believed that gold gave you safe passage into the afterlife??* 

*Angels\_Fan\_86: You guys are making too much hay over the secret, esoteric meaning of things.  Look at the numbers themselves.  It might be an address we need to go to.  They did say come find us.*

*Louie\_Da\_17th: ok, idiot.  You go to every address that number could mean.  Well be here using more than one braincell.*

I couldn’t resist.  I jumped in.

*PA\_Kaonashi020: I think the guy who said address is right.  Map coordinates, maybe?*

I logged out and turned off my computer.  The guy who said address was *definitely* right.  I’d solved the little riddle, decoded the clue.  I’d figured out where Draco Byssus Torta hid.  Actually, I could do one better: I knew the hidden truth about who Draco Byssus Torta actually was.

\*\*\*\*\*

*“I see those Draco Byssus Torta guys on 4Chan all the time, Reddit, wherever there’s a lot of kids.  They post these dumb little rhymes, supposedly to recruit new members.  I just ignore them.  My mom says they’re a death cult.”*

*- Alex L., age 15.  October 2014.*

\*\*\*\*\*

“I don’t get it, Miranda,” I insisted.  “What’s the game here?  You’re starting your own fake internet cult?”

Miranda sat cross-legged on her bed.  Even in sweaty running shorts, she looked impossibly beautiful with her ice-blonde mane, heart-shaped face, Renaissance sculpture figure and sparkling grey eyes.  She grinned at me - her mischievous Mona Lisa smile, the one that reduced prep school boys to mush and kept me following after her like a dopey duckling.

“It’s not fake, Schuyler,” she said.

“So you’re starting a real cult?  Based around that picture you have on the wall?”

I pointed to her mother’s framed artwork: the beautiful dragon, coiled around the tower.  The crude mimicry of which decorated the bottom of the Draco Byssus Torta website.  Miranda snorted.

“That’s what tipped you off?”

I nodded.  Her smile faded. 

“Okay, fine,” she said.  “I made the website.  But it’s based on a real secret society.  My dad used to be the leader of a magical club called Draco Byssus Torta.  He was a nuclear physicist; they only accepted the most brilliant as members.”

“Your dad was a scientist, but also Harry Potter?”  Miranda had never so much as mentioned her father as an entity.  

“Not like Harry Potter.  Draco Byssus Torta… they communicated with these half-angel creatures called Nephilim, who were banished to another plane of reality.  Draco Byssus Torta let the Nephilim… wear them.  Like, possess their bodies.  And in exchange, the Nephilim told them secrets about the future.” 

I wanted to laugh.  This all sounded like a rejected episode of Buffy.  But Miranda’s face was dead serious.  She kicked out her legs, rolled off her bed, went to her writing desk and pulled an old leather-bound book out of a drawer, which she offered to me.  I thumbed through pages of jagged cursive.

“I found my dad’s journal,” she said.  “Cleaning out the attic.  He disappeared when I was eight, you know.  My grandma and I thought he’d gone to Houston for a meeting.  He never came home.”

A flash of pain cut across Miranda’s pretty face.  My annoyance with her dissipated like morning fog.  

“Draco Bysssus Torta broke up before he vanished,” she stammered.  “And I thought… maybe… if he’s, ya know, still out there, and he thought someone was trying to start his old club again… then… he’d come back to me.  It’s stupid, I know.”

She hung her head.  I didn’t know what to say.  I had two adorable little siblings and parents who came home from work every night in time for family dinner.  Miranda had her grandmother, a dead mom, and an unsolved mystery.  

“I… guess the website is harmless,” I admitted.  “I don’t think anyone’s gonna take it seriously.”

\*\*\*\*\*

I fully intended to keep my pretty little nose out of Miranda’s new game.  She could cope with her dad’s absence exactly how she needed to; I’d focus on baseball and planning for college.  

Except, that weekend, Kyle called me.

“Hey man, it’s been awhile!” I said airily, careful not to reveal the pure bliss his voice inspired.

“Sky.”  *Christ.*  The way he said my name set me tingling.  “I got your email… you live around here now, right?  You go to Morrison?”

“Yeah!” I replied.  “How about you?  St. Vincent, right?”

"I think we were on the same message board,” Kyle said.

“Huh?”  

“You know,” he continued shyly.  “Draco Byssus Torta.  You’re PA Kaonashi.  You used that same name when we played Mortal Kombat in town?  I’m Angels Fan 86.”

Of course.  The chatroom.  Miranda’s website.  

“Um, I did what you said,” Kyle said.  “I looked up map coordinates.  34.32 and 118.01.  It’s the middle of the Angeles National Forest.  Not sure what that means?”

I opened my mouth, prepared to explain everything to Kyle.  To tell him the website, the riddle, and the entire recruitment angle was pulled out of thin air by a Morrison Prep girl named Miranda who’d read too many Umberto Eco novels.

*But if I tell him the truth*, I thought, *he won’t have any reason to talk to me.*  

“It’s an old campground - the Blue Turtle,” I said instead.  “It closed a year ago, after a fire.  Um, if you look at the message, not the rhyme, there’s six letters in a different font than the rest.  T-U-R-T-L-E.  And the text is blue.  Not black.  If you cut and paste it into word, it’s actually a really dark blue.”

Summer between sophomore and junior year, Miranda and I had gone camping with a few friends at the Blue Turtle Campground.  After s’mores and ghost stories around the fire, the two of us went off alone to try and hike to a waterfall we’d read about and got hopelessly lost.  We never found that waterfall.  But we did find a large, flat-topped boulder with a jagged fissure down the middle, up against the rock face of a cliff.  

The boulder was covered in colorful writing: painted or etched with marker.  Names, scout troop numbers, hearts with initials, an occasional opinion about sucking dick.  Miranda hoisted herself onto the face of the rock.  She stared into the fissure and squealed with amusement.  Hundreds - thousands - of folded pieces of paper had been shoved into the crack.  

I climbed up beside her.  We unfolded a handful of notes and read them out loud to each other in the moonlight.

*Five years ago, I had an affair.  Ray doesn’t know Kimmy isn’t his daughter.*

*I stole my stepfather’s car and crashed it.  My brother got blamed.  He went to juvie and came out an addict.*

*I killed Lulu.  I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.*

Some of the notes looked like they’d been there for years.  We realized this was a confession rock of sorts: people wrote down their secrets and shoved them into the fissure.

\*\*\*\*\*

*“After his funeral, I started going through Jamie’s computer.  I found messages between him an older man: a Draco Byssus Torta recruiter.  This recruiter told my son to drink antifreeze and suffocate himself with a belt.  He said if he did, he’d be able to communicate with the Nephilim.*

*They all say my son committed suicide.  I call what that cult did to him murder.”*

* *Linda J., bereaved mother.  August 2018.*

\*\*\*\*\*

“You sure you know where you’re going?”  Kyle asked.

“Trust me."

It hadn’t been difficult to find the Blue Turtle Campground.  I recognized the sign from the highway: childish Huck Finn lettering with backwards R’s and a homely cartoon turtle.  We parked and left the hard, bare dirt of the campground for dry, bushy wilderness - heading awkwardly northwest, guided by Kyle’s compass and the pulsating of my lizard brain, the muscle memory.

It was late, and the woods were darker than I’d anticipated.  But we’d brought flashlights.  And, though my skin was scratched and itchy, bristles clung to my clothes, and unattractive rings of sweat formed under my arms, Kyle and I were having a really great time together.  

The trees thinned.  We pushed past a hanging vine with purplish leaves and into a clearing.

In front of us: the cliff face, and a large rock with a jagged crack nearly cutting it in two.

“Holy shit,” Kyle said.

The rock was just as I remembered.  Graffiti coated every inch.  KAT WUZ HERE.  BROWNIE TROOP 519 2002.  FUCK BUSH.  The bottom looked fuzzy with black fungal growth.  

“What do we do next?” Kyle asked.

I was way ahead of him.  I pulled a notebook out of my bag, tore off two pages, and procured two pens.  I offered Kyle one of each.  Then, I vaulted onto the flat top of the rock.

“C’mon,” I said.  “We’ve got to write a secret and put it in the crack.  That’s a thing people do here.  *Tell them a secret and they might reveal.*  The poem, remember?”

Kyle smiled a goofy, childish smile.  He climbed up and sat across from me.  We were silent for a moment, scribbling.  I wrote: *I know the crazy bitch who started this charade, but I’m not telling because I’m here with a hot guy*.  I folded up the note and shoved it deep into the fissure, my hand brushing against older secrets written on water-faded paper.  I pulled my hand out as Kyle inserted his.  We touched.  Electricity shot through my core.  Kyle withdrew his hand quickly, throwing himself off balance.  He lost his footing, slid, and tumbled into the narrow crevice between the stone and the cliff face.  

“Shit… ugh,” he groaned.  

A shuffling, and Kyle stood.  The stone came to his sternum.  His eyes were wide with wonder.

“Man, you’ve got to see this,” he said. 

I rolled over and lowered myself into the crevice beside him.  My feet crunched against thorny brush and discarded beer cans, and then I saw what he saw, painted onto the hidden back side of the confession rock in hot pink.  

www.sLuT&bk.com.  Surrounded by pink rays like the sun.  

The paint looked fresh.  

\*\*\*\*\*

“Of course it was me,” Miranda confirmed, giggling on her beanbag chair.  “*Somebody I know* had to go and tell the whole chatroom the numbers are map coordinates.  A couple of them figured it out and told all the other nerds.”

“A lot of scouts camped at the Blue Turtle Campground,” I said.  “Wait.  You’re in the chatroom?”

Miranda snorted.  “Boy, I *started* the chatroom.”

I sat on her bed.  “Well, the URL isn’t real.  www.sLuT&bk.com.  It goes to 404 Not Found.”

“I own the domain,” Miranda said.  “I’ll publish a website when I figure out a new scavenger hunt for the message board dweebs.”  She grinned wickedly.  “Schuyler… you’re telling me you went traipsing through the woods to find the painted confession rock?  Didja happen to go there with a cute boy?”

A happy little thrill bubbled up.  But I didn’t want to tell Miranda I was talking to Kyle again.  She knew all about our kiss, and that he’d broken my heart.  If I told her I’d gone traipsing through the woods with the famous Kyle from baseball camp, she’d spend the rest of the night lecturing me about how I shouldn’t waste my time with such an obvious scrub.

“I went with my kid brother,” I lied.  “Now can we just get ready for Kelsey’s party?”

Kelsey’s pool party was a dud.  We ran out of booze 45 minutes in, the hot tub didn’t work, there were too many people and no space to dance, and Kelsey’s playlist included an unpalatable amount of country.  Miranda kept herself busy kicking Tom from AP Chem’s ass at beer pong.  I drank a cup of shitty beer, ate half a weed brownie, and escaped to my car.

I’d stashed Miranda’s father’s journal in my glove compartment.  She’d given it to me; I hadn’t sat down and actually read it yet.  I turned on my overhead light, leaned back in the driver’s seat, and opened the leather-bound book.  The secrets of a vanished cult leader seemed much more interesting than a hundred teen-agers grinding against each other in a tiny suburban backyard.  

It turned out Jake, Miranda’s father, was a real piece of work.  He called himself Jake the Culler, and he barely mentioned his dead wife or his little daughter.  Instead, he wrote page after page of nonsensical chants and rhymes, apparently spells to contact and mind-meld with the Nephilim.  The Nephilim, he wrote, were the hybrid children of angels and men.  They’d been banished to a barren plane by the archangels, from which the Nephilim commandeered and possessed the bodies of the Draco Byssus Torta initiates.  They craved human experiences: food, drink, lovemaking, rain on their faces.  But they also had a taste for some messed-up shit.  Murder, bestiality, arson.  Torture.  Jake described the Draco Byssus Torta rituals in great detail.  He also detailed, gleefully, the abuse inflicted upon those seen as traitors to the cult.  

Ever see the Museum of Torture at the Renaissance Fair?  Yeah.  Think along those lines.  And his most virulent vitriol was reserved for those who defected and tried to form their own groups, to use Draco Byssus Torta teachings for their own benefit.

In the end, Jake the Culler’s writings devolved into nonsense.  He’d given too much of himself to the Nephilim.  He’d driven himself mad.  

\*\*\*\*\*

At eleven the next morning, I was jolted awake by my ringing cell phone.  I heard Kyle’s voice.

“Schuyler!” He squealed excitedly.  “I tried the URL again!  The one we found at the campground.  And… and it’s there!  A new message from Draco Byssus Torta!”
