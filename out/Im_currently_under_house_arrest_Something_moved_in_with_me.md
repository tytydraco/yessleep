I'm Alec. Like the title says, I'm currently under house arrest. The specifics as to why I'm under house arrest I won't say due to privacy concerns. Privacy has been a particularly rare commodity for me as of late. I started my sentence Two months ago, about a week in I woke up one morning, and well, he was there. I don't know who he is, what he is, or even why he is, despite how little I know about him he seems to already know just about everything about me there is to know. I don't know how he knows half of the things he does. If he has a name, he won't tell me it. Since he showed up I've just been calling him "Warden", at first it was just a joke given my current predicament what with the ankle monitor and all, but, as time has gone on that moniker has turned into a much crueler joke than I ever intended it to be, and it's entirely directed towards me now.

In the very beginning, the first day he showed up, I treated it like anyone would, I screamed at him to get the hell out of my house, demanded to know who he was, what he was doing, lied and said I had a gun. Needless to say, he wasn't intimidated, not even a little. Why would he be? Now I recognize how stupid my expectations were back then, but I was completely ignorant to the unruly monster that had decided to make my home his. Where do I even start? The only reason I'm even able to be writing this is that he has allowed it. Everything I do goes through him first these days.

The first week was the hardest by far, back before I understood the true danger this thing was capable of. That was when I earned my first punishment. How do I even describe what happened to me? First off, what I did to earn it. It was the first week, the first day even. I was screaming my head off, telling this perceived crack head to get out of my living room and fast, when I had started my rant, he just looked on at me with this face of slight amusement, standing there like an immovable wall. It pissed me off even more, how lax this stranger was, in my house. I swung at him, my fist made contact perfectly fine which was expected, what wasn't anticipated by me was how little it affected the man in front of me. By little I mean, not at all. It did nothing to him, he didn't wince, it certainly didn't wipe that shit eating grin off of his face, if anything my feeble attempt to hurt this intruder fueled that stupid face of his.

But something did happen, something I only noticed moments later, but it wasn't anything to do with him, no, it was happening to me. In an instant I felt the most otherworldly pain spreading throughout the entirety of my lower face. My jaw felt as if the bone was on fire beneath my skin, my teeth all felt as if they were exploding inside of my mouth, my eyes were flowing like a waterfall from the pain, I felt as if my skull was melting inside of me. I didn't understand what had happened, how it was happening, needless to say it immediately diverted my attention, I ran into my bathroom, nearly tripping in the hallway over a wadded-up hoodie I had tossed from my last trip out to work, still the only real moments of freedom I have to this day.

Once I reached my goal, my bathroom mirror, I slammed the open cabinet shut and stared into the mirror opening my mouth, what I saw however, merely confused me, I was still in absolute agony. I was expecting to see a bunch of nails shoved through my gums, that's what it felt like anyway, but no, that wasn't the case. My teeth did look different, a little smaller, and a different shade than they had been previously, but I didn't understand. It's not like I could have understood in my current state anyway; it was hard to think much of anything while in that much pain. I didn't have to stand there in confusion for very long, however.

I don't know if he manifested out from behind me or if he had simply walked from my living room to the bathroom and I hadn't noticed, I was a little preoccupied at the time. For what felt like an eternity he just stared at me, studying me. I can't explain why but it felt as if he was taking in every thought I was thinking, listening to words I wasn't speaking. Through the blistering pain in my face, I heard him, his calm collected voice was the only clear thing I could perceive at the time, almost suffocating in its clarity.

"It's amazing how little humans know about their own bodies."

As he spoke, he made it a point to look at me directly in the reflection of my eyes on the mirror, never breaking his contact.

"It's painful, I know, but you need to learn how to behave yourself"

I was still in agony, but despite the immense pain I was in, despite the sweat drenching my forehead, despite how white my fingertips had become as they clung to the edge of my sink for dear life, I listened, I listened like a captive audience member. He seemed to register the increasing urgency of my plight and cut to the chase.

"To be blunt, I took away your enamel, not permanently, I'll give it back don't you worry. Your enamel is crucial to your oral health. Keeps your teeth from being too delicate, too...sensitive. Most humans have some degree of enamel erosion, but to have not a single trace of enamel at all...it's a different story. Anything can set them off right now, even your own saliva, even the heat from your own mouth is enough."

Normally a biology lesson like that would be completely lost on me but, in that moment, I understood every word, maybe not the specifics, but I understood enough, I understood that this thing that was in my house, was not a man, it was not a human, and it could do things to me I couldn't even dream of, terrible things. It was shortly after he finished his little mantra that he "returned" my enamel. What that meant I don't know. Was he holding it somewhere? Was it just an illusion, a trick he played on me? I don't know. I don't want to know. That was my first lesson, I didn't want anymore.

That first punishment was enough to stop me from screaming at him to get out of my house, that single event was enough for me to learn that if he was going to leave it was going to be when he wanted, not me. It wasn't enough to completely break me. That still hasn't happened yet. I've had many more punishments in the time after that first day.

Some are more realistic. Ice baths, a simple slap here or there, maybe a skipped meal or two, when I really screw up. that's when the scary shit happens. I don't know when this is going to end. I'm assuming it will end after my sentence is up. I really don't know. I don't even know if he's actually related to my sentence or if whatever he is just decided to show up at the worst time possible. I doubt it's a coincidence though, after all, it's the perfect time to torment someone like this. To make someone feel so utterly helpless in their own home, when I can't just leave.

My only respite remains my job, eight hours a day, five days a week, to and from, nowhere else. After that, it's off to home, with Warden.

I've got more to say as is, and Warden certainly doesn't seem like he'll be leaving me alone anytime soon, so I'm sure I'll end up writing out a few of these, unless of course Warden decides I'm no longer allowed.
