…Anything and everything is possible…that is…anything that you can imagine, dream of, or consider as a concept of your reality will or has existed in one point or another. Let me explain.

 

When I was 6 years old I first understood what happens after death. It was a night when I was staring outside into the sky in my 1 bedroom apartment while sharing a bedroom with my brother that I first got to see a glimpse of our reality. it felt like an out of body experience where as my body starred into the night sky I flew out into the vast emptiness of the universe. It was breath taking. I was in awe but it also was over stimulating as I could not comprehend the reality that was being displayed into my senses. At my young age I understood that this was the basis of my before and what will become my after.

As I grew older, the experience will come and go every once in a while where I have had a hard time differentiating fiction from reality. It came to a point when I was 8 or 9 years old that I begun to act out the figment of my imagination to the neighborhood kids in the apartment playgrounds that they were in awe at the creation I was able to develop based off my own imagination. Sadly, in the back of my mind I understood that it was a reality I developed either in my vivid dream state or in my active dream state when conscious. The more I grew older, the more I understood that this was more than an active imagination as it continued to pass farther than the capacity of my own reality. I started to envision future states whether it be several years in the future of several days and it will come to me in segments of De Ja Vu. I would pause and step back and observe my surrounds and state out loud to my peers “ Woh…I’m getting major de ja vu vibes right now…” with my elementary school friends brushing it off.

In high school it was difficult to tap into this realm as I was hitting puberty and hormones were making it difficult to connect into the state of mind I was able to access when I was young but every once in a while I get a random sign or vision that would inform me what would be next to come. At 23 years old, this was when I began to develop an understanding to all the visions and existential out of body experiences I was having as I studied for my background in science in university. My roommate began to introduce me to scientific concepts I had never conceived and classes taken on philosophy let me understand that there is more to our reality than we may be able to perceive.

Then…it hit me…We as humans are only limited to the senses that are provided (Touch, Taste, Smell, feel, See) by the human body and slowly it began to make sense when avid drug participators stated that they were able to perceive the universe in a grandeur state due to the hallucinogen’s expanding their state of mind. I was always an avid smoker but only focused in the “now” but never in the “then” which may have prevented me into seeing the larger picture. I began to study the concept of what “Is” our actual selves through philosophy and attempt to identify what makes us actually…us.

That’s when I started to learn about the simulation theory. Now, I am not a heavy believer in the theory process in itself but started to place the theory into concept to determine if it was a mere possibility. Every scientist and YouTube theory genius dumbs the concept down to mere programming but in a larger scale its more than us humans could possibly conceptualize. In laments terms think of it as the matrix but replace technology as a concept so far advance that we cannot differentiate it from magic (as we are not capable to conceptualize the technology used). If we as humans can lightly imagine of the possibility of creating/developing reality into our own image (i.e. video games, movies, etc.) what’s to say that our own reality is not but Its own construct created by an entity even more grandeur than we humans (i.e. our concept of GOD). That’s when I came to realize that if our reality was created by an entity, then what’s to say that we are the only reality that was developed in their image.

That’s what lead me to the thought process of multiple worlds theory where there are more than on world created in tandem with our own bearing slight or large differences. Think of it as like the movie “The One” with Jet Li or Rick and Morty as they hop from one universe to another. This had me in a downward spiral of reality that if the simulation theory is true, then the many world theory is true and if the many world’s theory is true, then the concept of multiple of realities is true… and if the multiverse is true…then anything and everything is true which ultimately must determine that there is a creator to our conceptual reality.

But then I began to realize…even if it were all true…outside of our reality there exist no time except for the state of being. This state of being would most likely be the epidemy/endpoint to human innovation that lands in the state of what we would perceive as “God” as their technology advances them to the state in which they can control the 1^(st), 2^(nd), 3^(rd), 4^(th), and 5^(th) dimensions. This is where I would determine that “They” at their mere curiosity to want to observe the extent to which their “Being” began lead them to create the reality that YOU now exist in today (Big Bang). Ultimately creating a paradox that “WE” are our own gods as we would eventually create ourselves…because without us creating ourselves…we would not have existed in the first place. Sadly, this is only a thought process I came to understand based of my own personal experiences.

Remember, anything and everything is possible. Sadly, we will not be able to understand this until we leave this plane of existence (Death).

Nothing is more certain than that…
