*I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off with my girlfriend, so I did the unthinkable: I went through her phone while she slept. There were no suspicious texts or calls, but I found a note from when she was a teen that worried me. I know I am still invading her personal space, but... just tell me what you think. Here it is:*

**Note: 04/22/2014**

"Sam!" my mother yelled from the kitchen, "Your father just called and said he was going to be late for dinner."

*The usual.*

"Samantha!" She called out again. I thought about putting on my headphones and pretending I did not hear her, but why risk the lecture?

*So needy.*

"Sam, did you hear me?" She was at the stairs now.

*Annoying.*

"Yeah, Dad, dinner, late. Got it!" I yelled back.

Yelling back and forth had become the new communication form since Tommy died. Everyone was always in a different room, and the only real time we ever spent together was at the table for meals. We only used the table when Dad was home, so it was mostly just for dinner, but that was happening less often. I guess late nights at the office were his way of dealing with it. Mom had become a dedicated housewife, scrubbing at invisible stains on the countertop. Constantly wiping away Windex and tears from constant red eyes.

One more year, and I am off to college. Feels like an eternity away. It is like I hear a ticking clock. Each tick stretches, pulling the seconds into minutes and dragging them into hours. Like time itself is reluctant to pass. I am sure I will come back for the holidays like everyone does on TV shows. Maybe.

Apart from the melodrama and the nonexistence, I think it is the gray my mother had decided most of the walls should be painted. It was supposedly the "in" color, but it was a constant reminder of how dull everything in this house was. Dull walls, dull people. I need to get out of here, at least for a while.

Our home had become a hollow echo. The walls seemed to close in on me, each shade of gray weighing my soul. I hungered for the freedom of open space, the earth beneath my feet, and the sky above my head. It was time for one of my walks.

I knew I was going as soon as I woke up this morning. I felt the itch. I already had my pack ready and sat by my closet door, leaning against my yellow, non-gray room wall. "Yellow is to help you relax," Mom had said when she painted it last month. After a week, I realized it was the same yellow of hospital rooms. Whatever. I put on my track shoes and grabbed my earbuds and my bag. I gave a quick, "I'm going for a walk!" in tradition with the Shaw's form of communication and headed out the door.

I started jogging right out the door. The woods were only a couple blocks over, and then I'd reach more than 100 acres of undeveloped land, but I felt so exposed until I got that tree line. I needed this escape from what life had become. It was all routine and lies. I had learned to hide everything I felt by pretending to be someone I was not. No, it was more like something I was not. Normal.

Usually, I would slow down and walk, enjoying nature while taking it all in to think about this release of mine. That would not be the case this time. A week had passed since my last walk, and tension coiled within me. I exploded and sprinted as soon as I was off the pavement, and my shoe hit the dirt path.

It might have been the Nero song that just happened to come on my playlist as I left Suburbia, USA, and transitioned into the wilderness or just the plain anticipation of doing something other than the routine, but I felt a burst of energy. I was off running through the tall grass and leaping over fallen branches. Sweat started to drip into my vision, and my legs were beginning to burn, but it was worth it. I had lost track of time, but my usual thirty-minute trek had to have been cut in half because I was coming across the creek that ran through my woods. I slowed down to cool down. After all, it would do no good for me to get a cramp out in the middle of nowhere.

I watched the sunlight break through the trees and the wind ripple over the knee-high grass. It was peaceful. I clearly see that I need to be more patient with my mother as I stand here. My father works late nights and very hard just to provide for us. That it had nothing to do with what had happened to Tommy. The cracks had begun to show, my mask chipping away. That's why I was here. To gain clarity.

I heard a noise, and it got louder as I walked closer. I stopped to listen. No voices, just a rustling.I stopped, kneeling down as I brought my bag from over my shoulders. I waited, listening to see if there was anything different in the sounds coming from over the bend of my lightly worn path.

Nothing.

I slowly unzipped my bag and reached in. Pushing the water bottle aside, I grabbed the hilt of Tommy's old army knife. It has a sharp edge for slicing and a sharp saw on its upper edge for everything else. The black seven-inch blade has always fascinated me, and it really is an incredible knife.

Even just holding it, the heaviness of the knife makes me feel protected. So now, alone in the woods, I carefully pull it out and slide it out of its black leather sheath. I lose myself in the moment as I watch the blackness of the blade come out into the day. Instead of the light bouncing off the knife, it seems like the light ricochets away from it. It's almost like the light wants nothing to do with such an evil instrument. I wonder what this has been used for before it reached my hands. Did my brother end his life with it during his tour in the war against terror? Had it been in self-defense, or was it like before? Had he been the terror?

I rise cautiously. I'm trying to make as little noise as possible, but I know I have been heard because the noise up ahead has stopped.

I take my time now. My heart is racing now instead of my legs. When the noise starts again, I take five more steps and am right up against a large tree. I stop breathing in. Scared, excited, unsure, but unable to turn back. I do consider it, though. I could turn around now, snatch up my bag, and return to civilization. The noise starts again, and I take a small, panicked breath. No, this is my escape; this is where I go to get away from it all, and I won't be scared off.

The knife met resistance, a crunchy scraping sound echoing in the air as it found bone. In that instant, any doubt vanished as I cut open the neck of the Peterson's dog. The rush is instant and better than anything I have ever felt. It always was. I had not needed this release when I brought him out here, so I tied him up two days ago. He had been waging his tail as soon as he saw me, and I am sure it would have been waging as well if I had had one. I have never intentionally killed anything so large, and it was fantastic.

I would have waited a couple more days, but it was only a matter of time before the Petersons decided to search further into the woods for their pet.

I sat beside him, watching the blood slowly move toward the creek to mix with the water. The blood no longer gushed. The show was over. I had left the knife in so I would not get completely soaked in blood. I had made that mistake before. I slowly pulled out my now black and red blade, wiping it on matted fur. I walked over and rinsed it in the river, making sure it was all one color again before walking over to my bag. I sheathed the blade and changed it for a small, foldable military shovel. I had so many small gifts like these from Tommy after he died.

Now for the fun part. Hiding the body was almost as big of a rush as the kill. It's not the same type of rush, but it's just as exciting. I knew this land would be developed one day, but I would be long gone by then, and so would anyone who cared. I went a small distance from the creek and broke through the dirt that would soon hide what I really was.

For now, though, it did matter, so I buried the mess I had made once the hole had been dug deep enough. The possibility of being found out was not appealing to me but my ability to stay hidden. To seem normal even though I knew I was the biggest fake in my family. I have thought about my sanity more than once and realized I am very sane. I might seem disturbed, and my actions grotesque, and perhaps some would consider me monstrous for killing someone's beloved pet.

I finished refilling the hole and scattered some debris to hide the freshly turned dirt.

Yeah, monstrous. I guess I can see myself as a monster, but I am very sane. It's funny that I am trying to convince myself of that. It is not like I would kill a person. 

Would I?
