I always wanted to work with animals.

When I was a kid, my father claimed he was allergic, so we could never have a dog or a cat or even a guinea pig. In high school, I thought about possible career tracks. I could work in a zoo or be a horse trainer or maybe even become a professor and find an entirely new species. But the state school I got into had a good veterinary program, so I that was that.  

I'm from a small city. It's quiet and clean, and people greet you with a smile on their face. There's only one veterinary clinic. It's family-owned and has multiple locations as well as a complete monopoly. It doesn't pay its workers well, so after a few years there, I wanted to move on. I didn't want to leave my home, my friends, and my family though. So I started looking into being a *different* kind of vet.

When you need to put your pet down, it's very traumatic to take it, on the last day of its life, to a place it's terrified of.  And usually pets are terrified of the vet's. So there's a service whereby you can have a vet come to your house and put down your pet in the privacy and comfort of your home. It's not exactly a pleasant experience for anyone involved, but it's almost always better than the alternative.  

These kind of services are always hiring because the vets who work for them get worn out real fast. Nobody becomes a vet because they want to kill animals all day. But I was young, I needed the money, and I was fed up with where I was. So I took the job.

It went well for a couple of years. I would visit four or five households a day. I made enough money to buy a condo downtown. Things were looking up. I was even thinking of starting my own practice. Give that family-owned firm a run for its money.

And then, one Christmas, I got an appointment.  

Holidays were usually quiet. Nobody wants to put down Miffie while the kids are unwrapping presents. But there it was, on the app, a 6pm appointment way out on the edge of town. Very little information was available. Just that the animal was a dog and the account was for a "Mr. Goucher". That name was outlined in red, which I'd never seen before. It was like it had been flagged.

I called my manager. "What's the deal?" I said.

"Oh," she said and then laughed nervously. "Nothing. Just that we've had some...issues with this account before. When you get there, just make sure that everything, uh, checks out before you proceed with the termination."

I asked her what that meant, "checks out", but she laughed nervously again and said her wife was cutting the turkey and she had to go.

Mr. Goucher's house was on the edge of town, a few miles past the last gas station. The homes out there were set into the foothills of the mountain that loomed over the city. Most hadn't been taken care of and were crumbling.

The house was just off the local highway, up a long, dark driveway, which meant it was impossible to see from the street. Untrimmed branches whipped against the side of my two-door as I drove up the driveway. The house was low and wide with multiple doors, several of which were boarded up. The front yard was full of sodden, broken-down pallets and mounds of festering garbage. There were, unsurprisingly, no Christmas decorations. It was, by far, the worst house I'd ever had an appointment at. I figured this was the reason for the account being flagged.

The figure who opened the door wasn't at all what I was expecting. He was tall, stooped, and clad in tattered black clothing, with an Egyptian ankh around his neck. His face was lined and drooped, with running makeup which made him look a bit like the lead singer from a defunct '80s goth band. He didn't bother to say hello, just motioned me inside.

I almost didn't step over the threshold.

The long corridor was covered with runes, spray-painted and etched into the hacked-away at plaster. The place smelled like a toilet. I considered turning around and leaving, but I was a little concerned of what the guy might do if I did.

Mr. Goucher, at least that's who I assumed it was, led me into a living room where all the windows were covered with black trash bags. The walls had dozens of artworks done in mixed media, mainly charcoal but smeared with another, thicker substance that I assumed was feces. The subject of each artwork was the same: a figure with fiery red eyes, far in a dark distance.

Then something on the floor twitched.

I stepped back in shock, recovering immediately when I saw what it was.

A dog.

A black dog.  

I don't know what I'd been expecting. A big Rot, an ancient German Shephard, some kind of attack dog which was approaching the end of its life.

Instead, this was one of the most beautiful dogs I'd ever seen.

A puppy, about a year old. Male. He was small, but not undersize. He was a mutt, a mix of Labrador and Portuguese Water Dog with a little Shiba thrown in, if I had to take a guess. He had a healthy, lustrous coat and a fine disposition. Came right up and nuzzled my ankle, panting happily. He was one of those dogs that practically smiled when he saw you.

"What's his name?" I asked.

The man just shook his head.

"What's wrong with him?" I asked.

The man just shook his head.

I knelt down and did a quick inspection. I obviously had no advanced medical equipment, but the dog appeared to be fine. His gums were in good condition, his skin had no lesions, his belly was soft but firm. He didn't even appear to be anxious, though he lived in one of the worst shitholes I'd ever been in.

"This dog appears perfectly healthy," I said.

"It's not," the man said. These were the only words I would ever hear him speak.

"Sir," I said. "I can't put down a healthy animal. That would go against my oath."

The man made a wet, sick noise deep in his throat. It took me a moment to realize it was a laugh.

"This isn't a joke," I said.

The man spat something nasty onto the ground. The dog nuzzled my ankle even harder. The man stared at the dog with such hate I was worried he would kick him.

I'm not a courageous person, but if in that moment the man had tried to kick the animal, I would have taken the black dog out of that home, no matter what the consequences.

Instead, the man shrank back slightly as if disgusted, or even afraid, of me.

It was then that I knew I couldn't take the dog. There were no signs of abuse. The man might be a nasty person, but he'd never laid a finger on the animal. And, clearly, the dog was getting enough to eat.

"I'm leaving," I said. At that moment, I wanted to bend down and pet the black dog's head, but something stopped me. I wish I knew what.

I felt the man at my back the entire way down that freaky hallway. Sweat began to run down my neck, trickling across my back. *Just because he doesn't hurt the dog doesn't mean he won't hurt* ***you***, I thought.

I threw open the front door and stumbled outside into the dark. I thought I heard something behind me like a cry. I whipped around. In the second before the door shut, I saw the man staring at me, something like terror in his face. The black dog was there too, its eyes a fiery red.

I went to my parents' house for Christmas dinner and had more than a couple of drinks.

For New Year's, I went to a friend's party. I met someone and, unusually, went home with her. She lived up the mountain in this nice little cabin. Coming back down on New Year's Day, hungover and pretty pleased with myself, I ended up driving past Mr. Goucher's house. Instinctively, I slowed down. Even though the driveway was long and dark, I could still see the police vehicles parked up at the top.

It wasn't curiosity that compelled me to park and make my way up that long driveway. I was worried about the dog, I think. Worried that Mr. Goucher, or whoever the man was, had finally lost his temper and done something horrible. I cursed myself for not taking the black dog out of that home.

The house looked much the same, except for all the police vehicles parked haphazardly on the lawn. A bunch of cops were taking photos and drinking coffee and smoking. No one was talking much. They were all kind of quiet, like they'd just had a shock.

Somehow I managed to get all the way to that front door without anyone stopping me. A detective stood there, hunched over, wiping something off his mouth. It took me a moment to realize it was vomit.

I craned to look around the detective and saw the worst thing I'd ever seen in my life.

You see some pretty awful things in veterinary school. They show you what happens to horses in the glue factories. How abattoirs work. How dog food is made. Domestic animals have hard ends. But the human being I saw in that hallway had met a much harder end than any animal I'd ever seen.

The detective finally noticed me and asked who I was. "I'm a doctor," I said. It wasn't totally a lie. He told me that they didn't need me. That some kind of large animal had gotten into the house and torn apart the man who lived there. Not a bear, it didn't look like a bear attack, more like a wolf attack. But wolves rarely attack humans, and never inside of homes. I told him that, and he just stared at me.

"What about the dog?" I said.

"What dog?" said the detective.

"The man had a black dog, a puppy."

The detective shook his head. "No sign of a dog. Maybe it got away."

I doubted that.

A few days later it began.   

I was driving home from a late appointment, and just past Main Street, right past the ice cream place, I saw them.

A pair of fiery red eyes.

I slowed the car and caught a glimpse of what I thought was a small, black dog, but then it closed its eyes and was gone, vanished into the dark.

I saw more of them as the week went on.  

Two pairs waiting in the bushes behind my condo. Half a dozen out back of the local tavern by the dumpster. Twenty or more circling a homeless man sleeping down by the river.   

That last night, I came home to an empty condo. I'd been out on a late night call. A sick cat. Nobody called about dogs anymore. My place felt different. I stood there in the dark and tried to figure out why. There were no signs of breaking and entering. Then I realized what it was.

The smell. My condo reeked of dog.

I tried to turn and run, but something held me where I stood. A pair of fiery red eyes appeared in my bedroom and slowly stalked towards me. Everything inside me screamed to run, but my body remained frozen.

As it came closer, I could see the dog's outline. It was no puppy. It was a huge beast, all muscle and tattered black fur. I knew that as soon as I could behold its face, its *true* face, that I would be finished.

So I shut my eyes. And ran. The dog made no sound. That was what was most terrifying. I could hear it though, launching itself through space, and I knew, I *knew*, that its teeth were aimed for my neck.

I slammed the door behind me just in time. Halfway to my car, I heard the sound of it splintering through my front door, but by then I knew I was safe.

As safe as I would ever be.

I left that night. Left my condo, my job, my *life*. Crashed with some friends a few towns away while everything went down. I lost of a lot of friends, some family. I'm not proud of running away, but I'm not ashamed either.

You would have done the same thing. Don't pretend like you wouldn't.

I don't know why Mr. Goucher needed me to put the black dog down, why he couldn't do it himself. I believe it had some kind of hold over him. The same kind of hold it had over me when I stood there motionless as it stalked towards me. I can't explain it, but I am, somehow, certain this is true. The same way I am certain that what happened in the small city I am from wasn't a series of bizarre, unexplained wolf attacks. 

A few months later, everything seemed to settle down. The attacks had gotten worse and worse and then finally they just stopped, all by themselves.

I waited another week and then went back home to see for myself.

Everything was the way it used to be. The streets were quiet and clean, and people greeted you with a smile on their face. There was only one change I noticed.

So many people had dogs.

Cute little black dogs.  

I now live in a big city. I rent a tiny apartment. I have few friends here and no family. I haven't practiced veterinary medicine for years. I'm a delivery driver. The money's not very good, and I don't like my job.

But I don't have to work with animals.
