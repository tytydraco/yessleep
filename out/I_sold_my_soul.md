I never believed in the Devil. People talked about him like he was some boogeyman hiding under the bed, but I thought he was just a story adults told children to keep them in line. That all changed the night I met him.

It was raining. The streets were empty except for the occasional flicker of a dying streetlamp. I had missed my bus and was late for a meeting that could change my life. The crossroads ahead looked ordinary, except for the man leaning casually against the lamppost. He wore a perfectly tailored black suit and had a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

“You look like a man with ambition,” he said, his voice smooth and deliberate. “I can help you achieve it. All I ask in return is your soul.”

I laughed. “That’s absurd.”

“Not at all,” he said, tilting his head. “Your soul. One hundred percent. In exchange, whatever you desire. Wealth, power, fame. Anything.”

I was desperate. My bank account was empty. My career was stalling. In that moment, the thought of never worrying again made my pulse quicken. “Alright,” I said, almost without thinking. “Deal.”

The first weeks were magical. Money appeared in my account that I hadn’t earned. Opportunities fell into my lap. People admired me and even envied me. Life had become effortless. I thought I had won.

Then the whispers started. At first, I dismissed them as wind or imagination, but soon I could hear them when the world was quiet. A voice, mine but not mine, called my name from empty corners. Shadows moved where there shouldn’t be shadows. I saw reflections in mirrors that weren’t mine—grinning, mocking, hollow-eyed.

I tried to undo it, to back out, to bargain again. But he didn’t negotiate twice. Every attempt ended with a flash of his smile and the words, “You belong to me.”

The world I had gained began to rot. Friends disappeared, careers I had coveted crumbled, and the money I had accumulated turned cold, metallic, and impossible to spend. I was trapped in a gilded cage. Every night, I felt invisible claws digging into my chest, dragging my essence down.

Then tonight, it came for me. I was alone in my apartment when the air grew thick and heavy. Shadows pooled in corners like ink. The temperature dropped. I heard the soft, deliberate click of shoes on my floor.

“I’ve come to collect,” it said.

I ran, but the doors wouldn’t open. Windows wouldn’t budge. The shadows twisted into something solid, something waiting. I screamed for help, but the world outside was silent and indifferent. The floor beneath me split open, darkness gaping like a mouth. I felt it—cold, ancient, certain—wrapping around my chest. My body convulsed, my mind screamed, and all I could see was that smile, impossibly wide and impossibly patient.

It whispered, “All debts are due. All souls must pay.”

I understood, finally, that I had never been alive. I had been borrowed. And now, I would be taken.

The last thing I felt was the darkness swallowing me whole and the sound of my own laughter—hollow, terrified, endless—echoing in a void that had no bottom.

I had sold my soul. And I would never be free.
