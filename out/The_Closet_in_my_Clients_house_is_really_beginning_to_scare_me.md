The day that changed my life forever started as usual. I woke up, ate some cereal, put on my bussines attire and went to the client of my real eastate bussines.

 He was trying to sell an old house that he inheritated from his late great grandmother. The massive building was about 1 acre in size which was seemingly to big for the old women to attain. Rain was leaking from the ceiling, the lights didnt work and its eerie feel can not be described. I knew I had some renovations to do if i wanted to sell this at an reasonable price. Although i felt like the leaks in the ceiling could be fixed by myself and save a lot of money that whould have otherwise gone into a construction company. So i ordered the things I needed which arrived at 10 pm that night.

 Since i wasnt far from the house and was really bored at the time I decided to start the renovations. As I entered the house a chill ran down my spine. The eerie feel of this old building grew stronger at night. My heart almost stopped when i heard the floorboards in the bedroom creeking. "Hello is anyone there" I anxiously said. The stairs squeecked while i made my way up the stairs. I swung open the bedroom door and there was nothing. I calmed myself down and got to work. All went well till i saw something up one of the cracks. It seemed like an oil lamp. I was very intrigued by the situation and used a ladder to reach it.

 With my hammer I widened the hole and revealed a secret room. It was an old vintage attic filled with old fancy furniture. What stuck out most to me was the closet. It sloppily covered with black paint and chained up to keep it closed. "Very intriguing" I thought to myself as i started hammering the chains. They were brutally tough so I had to find another way. I searched in every single room of the house to hopefully find a key. But nothing. So I ordered some Pizza to think about the situation.

 "If something of value was in there and i kept it, whould anyone notice? Nah this secret room had no entrance so there is no shot they know about it. What if it was a trap?". My thought string abruptly ended when the pizza delivery guy arrived with a large peperoni pizza. I tipped him decently and started eating. Then i remembered i had a jackhammer at home.

 I rushed towards the car and arrived back at the house at 11:30 pm. Exhausted I transported the jackhammer to the secret room and started drilling. The chains eventually gave up and I started ripping them off the closet. "Finally" I thought "Finally ill satisfy my curiousity and discovered the secrets hidden in this closet." Excited I ripped open the closet door to hopefully reveal something of value. But when i saw what was in there my heart sank. There was a pale skinny being staring at me with its red wide open eyes. It opened its grotesque mouth filled with small sharp teeth and said: "its creature time" and creatured all over the place
