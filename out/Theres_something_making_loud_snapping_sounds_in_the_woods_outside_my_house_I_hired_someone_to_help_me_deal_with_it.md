This is an update post for you all regarding the situation with that thing in the woods outside. But if you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, I'll link the post that started this down below.

\---------------------------------------------

Now that that's out of the way, I'll pick up from where my situation was left a few days ago. After the brief encounter with my would-be home invader, the thing out in the forest seems to have gotten more bold and aggressive. For the past four nights I've been having that horrible dream of being chased through the woods in the dark by something unseen, and every morning I wake up feeling like it's just a bit closer to actually catching.

Over all, I've been sleeping less and less. Eating less and less. The headaches just keep happening, growing in intensity. I feel like I'm falling apart.

I can't afford to move. Almost everything I saved up went into this cabin. But it's not just the stress over the fact that I'll be homeless if I ran that's turned me into a mess. When you learn that there really are things that can't rationally be explained, that these things exist right under the 'civilized and perfect' world that we humans have so carefully crafted for our own protection... things just start to fall apart.

Vampires? Are they real? Have aliens actually come to Earth and abducted people? Bigfoot? All these things that I had previously assumed to be complete nonsense seem a lot more serious now that I know for a fact that thing, that -abomination- is lurking just out of my range of sight.

Now, I said I brought a gun up here with me... but that guy who attacked me had a gun in his hand when that thing turned him into ground beef on my lawn, I didn't even hear him fire a shot either. It's not given me a lot of confidence in confronting it myself, if I'm being honest. I think it knows that, somehow.

Two nights ago I heard it right outside my bedroom window, before I was about to go to sleep. It's always standing in my back yard at night, but it's never been this close before. Past my curtains I heard a bunch of little clicks across the glass... like it was tapping on it with a million tiny fingers at once. How the fuck was it doing that? Makes me sick.

It was only the following day to the window tapping situation when something dawned on me. If the supernatural exists, then those who hunt the supernatural have to exist as well, right? I started searching across the internet like a complete madman until I finally came into contact with a self-proclaimed monster hunter. I'll just call him Jay. I first met Jay on a forum discussing strange and unexplainable events, and after sharing my story with him he's agreed to help me.

Jay seems to think it must be some sort of forest spirit. Apparently you can kill those? I don't know, I was just desperate at that point, desperate enough to hire a possible lunatic and give him the location of my house. I'll now describe how that's turned out so far, as best as I can recall.

It was about mid-day when a car arrived in my driveway. It pulled up along side my truck and the now ownerless car that thief left behind. I got up from my seat on the porch, eyeing the car suspiciously. Out climbed a man who by all accounts looked pretty average. Scruffy brown hair, maybe about six feet tall, slightly built. A guy you wouldn't really think twice about while passing in the grocery store. I called out to him, somewhat nervously.

***"Can I help you?"***

The man took a few steps up to the porch before responding. his voice was somewhat gruff. ***"It's Jay, the guy you hired? I got the right place didn't I?"*** he asked, looking around in confusion.

***"Oh!... Y-yeah, sorry.. I uh... well I guess I thought you'd look...-"*** I trailed off before Jay spoke up.

***"Like some kind of super badass, right? Everyone who hires me says that. Common misconception. Don't need to look tough, only need to be effective, right?"*** He states, fixing me with a look. ***"Speaking of appearances, you look like shit."*** He said with unapologetic straightforwardness.

I rolled my eyes and replied with a bit more bitterness than I'd meant, but I was just too fucked to care at that point. ***"..Uh.. yeah.. I haven't been sleeping much on account of the fucking nightmare monster outside."***

Jay held up his hands apologetically. ***"Sorry, just trying to make small talk. I think I got an idea on how to deal with your little situation. Gonna invite me in or we just gonna keep standing around out here?"***

I bit back another snarky comment in favor of simply opening the door and entering. I waited for Jay to come in after before shutting and locking it behind us. For a moment I considered whether or not it would be a good idea to get stronger locks installed.. but would those really do anything? I feel like that thing could've already gotten me by now in all honesty, but why hasn't it? I turned into the kitchen and move to the small table, sitting down. Jay sat across from me and immediately began to talk before I can even get a word out.

***"So, from what I've gleamed during our chats online, you definitely seem to be dealing with some kinda nature spirit. A really pissed off one to boot.. ain't ever heard of one tearing someone apart like that poor bastard you mentioned. Brutal shit."*** He said, resting his arms against the table.

I nodded grimly, the memory of that carnage still fresh in my mind. ***"..I guess that would explain the big ass tree that grew out there over night, right?"***

***"Exactly!"*** he exclaimed, causing me to lean back. ***"See, the tree is part of my plan. I'm gonna piss that thing off by taking a whack at the tree with the axe I brought, make it come here under my terms. That's when we'll take care of it."*** He grinned.

I swallowed nervously. ***"...Uh... are you sure getting it mad is a good idea? I don't-..."*** I paused as what he'd said clicked in my mind. ***"What do you mean -WE-. I hired you to deal with it! Why do I have to help?"***

***"Don't blow a fuse... I only need you to manually turn on the floodlights outside your house. I figure once my plan is in action, the lights might disorient it and allow me to take it down with this."*** He said, grinning as he pulled a small, silver bullet out of his pocket. It was strangely carved, and even I could sense that there was something off about it.

***"...You're gonna shoot it? Are you gonna trap it to keep it from running?"*** I asked incredulously.

***"Mmmmhm, that I am. Both the bullet and the trap are made with a special curse designed to work on freaky shit like this. I've done it before, and I'll do it again."*** He nodded.

***"...Well I -assume- the curse doesn't work on humans considering how casually you pulled that out in my kitchen, right?"*** I asked, my exhaustion seeping into my words. Much to my annoyance, he ignored the question entirely, getting up from the table and walking to the window.

***"To be safe, I'll need to see the thing before I do my work, you know... verify it's actually a nature spirit out there. Ain't nothing worse than using the wrong gear to hunt."*** Jay said as he looked back to me. ***"Tonight we'll just camp out in your house and keep watch for it. Tomorrow we can get to work."***

Groaning internally, I wanted to argue with him against doing so... but I really couldn't think of a good reason not to. He was right. I looked to the clock.

***"...Okay, well it generally starts making those snapping noises around 6 or 7... then uh.. by 12 AM it's usually in my yard, I think. How're you gonna check to see what it looks like?"*** My hopes that he had some sort of magical bullshit way of doing this melted away as he spoke again.

***"Oh, brought a bigass flashlight with me, I'm gonna shine it with that from inside."***

....This fucking guy was gonna get me killed, was the thought that immediately came to mind. But he was the expert, right? Who was I to question any of this nonsense. After our discussion I went out and showed him the backyard, and the freaky tree at its middle. Glancing around toward the forest I couldn't help but think those trees out there looked more tangled together than they used to. It was darker in there too.

With nothing much else to do after that besides making small talk... which I obviously didn't do, I sat and watched the hours tick by. Although Jay had said that the plan wasn't happening tonight, I still found myself holding my rifle, cleaning it and triple-checking the firing mechanism as I sat there in my rocking chair. I practically died on the spot when I heard it, off in the woods.

**SNAP**

Jay woke up from the nap he'd been having in my armchair, a grin spreading across his face soon after. How on earth could anyone be excited about this? Crazy motherfucker. Like clockwork, the noises continued, slowly growing closer as time crept by, and just like all the previous nights that damn headache in my skull was starting to fire up as well.

**SNAP!**

The sun was beginning to set, the sky displaying a sunset that in other circumstances I would have found beautiful.

**SNAP!**

The forest grew dark. Like an impenetrable wall of wood and shadow. I began thinking about all the family members I'd disappointed in my life. Would I die here without ever seeing them again?

**SNAP!!**

The sun had finally dipped out of view. We moved to my bedroom since it had the clearest view of the back yard. Both of us were armed in case this little experiment went wrong. Jay even gave me one of those fancy bullets... which can apparently morph to fit any size of firearm. Where do you even buy this shit? There we waited with the curtains wide open. Never in a million years did I think I'd be trying to see it, not after what it did to that guy. Another gloomy night, without the 'bigass flashlight' Jay brought there'd have been no way we would've seen anything.

After almost an hour of awkward silence I got Jay's attention with a question. ***"....Sooo... exactly how many nature spirits have you been h-"***

**SNAP!!!**

We jumped. I swear, it hadn't been even five seconds that we'd turned our attention away from the window. Not five damn seconds and it was out there, standing next to the large tree that had so suddenly grown in my yard days before. That horrible, unmoving silhouette was all I could make out. I almost tackled Jay when he got up with the flashlight, fighting to suppress that animalistic bit of my brain that was constantly telling me to get the hell out of there.

I held my breath, shaking as Jay flipped the switch on the flashlight. A wide beam of light cut a path through the darkness... and finally gave me an eyefull of this thing.

***"Shit!"*** I exclaimed reflexively, going to aim my rifle when... I really took in what I was looking at. This thing was otherworldly.... and beautiful.

Its resemblance to an Elk was proven further when my eyes were finally able to see detail. Standing at around ten feet tall at the shoulder, the massive beast was covered in thick, dark green fur that reminded me of moss. It had leafy branches and twigs protruding from all over its body. The spirits gigantic set of antlers almost looked like they were made of some sort of crystal, gleaming like polished quartz in the powerful beam of light Jay cast upon it. I was dumbfounded by the sight... though I winced as my headache only spiked further. With a pained groan, I looked to Jay.

***"...God damn..."*** He finally said. Oddly enough, he didn't seem to be overtaken by the same splitting head pains that plagued me. ***"...Ain't never seen one of these that looked so... well.. so regal. Almost makes me feel bad about killing it later."***

The thing stood there, unmoving just as it had been the first time I laid eyes on it. But then it finally reacted. It turned its head toward us! This was it, I thought. I was gonna die here in my bedroom with this batshit insane monster hunter.... But it didn't move besides that in the slightest. No aggression in its stance, none of the murderous intent I assumed would be flowing from it like water. The movement of its neck caused one of the branches adorning its body to.. well.. snap. Just like the noises I'd heard.

Its eyes sparkled just like those crystalline antlers. Like I said.. it didn't appear aggressive, but meeting its dazzling gaze made me feel like my brain was about to leak out of my ears.

I didn't understand. Had the sight of this thing really caused that burglar to scream like he'd witnessed death itself? The thing that tore him to pieces looked like it belonged in a kids fairy tale book. I mean, it -was- unnatural I suppose.. but I wouldn't call it terrifying. Before I could further study it, Jay turned the flashlight off. The back yard was once again consumed in darkness, but if I focused I could still make out the outline of the spirit.

**SNAP**

***"Alright, hypothesis confirmed."*** Jay turned to me with a grin, but furrowed his brows upon seeing my sorry state. I'd placed both hands against the side of my head and had broken into a sweat by then. ***"Oh.. Yeah.. you mentioned headaches before.. They always this bad?.."***

***"No.."*** I sputtered out. ***"NEVER this bad.. feels like my brain is frying like an egg.."***

***"Hmm.. well.. maybe you're just particularly susceptible to this things energy or something. I don't feel anything."*** He stretched his arms over his head, yawning.

***"Anywho, I'm beat.. guess I'll be crashing on your couch since I didn't see any guest rooms. Gotta rest up for tomorrow. This thing looks pretty and all, but you -know- what it's capable of. Remember that, play it cautiously, and you'll come out of this fine."***

He gave me a wink, walking out through the door and shutting it behind him. This uncaring attitude of his was really getting under my skin.

And now I'm alone. Just finished typing all this out on my phone now... yeah I know he told me to rest, but my brain is still going crazy over all the stuff that happened. My headache has dulled since I stopped looking at the spirit outside. Still feels absurd typing that out.

I still don't get it, I feel like I'm missing something. The first night I saw it.. Well, I just saw its outline so I guess I don't know -what- I saw, not really, but the way I thought those antlers moved. It doesn't add up to me. Gonna try to sleep the night away as best I can.

***I'll write up another update post soon, if I don't die tomorrow.***
