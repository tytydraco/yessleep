The other day I met this kid who’s in seminary. He’s doing his residency (or whatever they call it) at the church my wife and I attend. She wanted to get more involved, so we wound up at an event with the whole congregation. She mingled, I stood in the back.

I’m quiet.

That’s how I came to meet the seminary kid. He approached me while I was back there alone. I think he somehow sensed I had wisdom for him, that I had been in his shoes not too long ago. I say this because we were soon talking about the Bible, then philosophy, and then dread. My three greatest understandings! But the more he went on, the more troubling it all became. I understood what was happening (to an extent), and it was troubling.

“These are dangerous things to talk about,“ I told him, half-joking. I invited him to go fishing. "We can talk more about it then."

That’s not too uncommon around here. We live in a gray fishing town and fishing is indeed a setting where wisdom is exchanged. It has been that way for a long time. As long as man itself, I think.

I’m more of a houndsman, but I do know how to fish. Of course I do. I just don’t care for the sport of it anymore. Nothing against fly fishing, but I prefer a cane pole. It’s simpler. All of this sounds irrelevant, but it’s exactly what I was planning on telling the seminary kid. It would all tie into the moral of the story. The cane pole would be both real and metaphorical—avoiding the complex when unnecessary. Simpler.

But when fishing day came he was grouchy. Quite clearly. I thought he might lighten up while we crafted our cane poles but he did not. His spirit was in a quagmire of despair.

We tied up the lines, got the worms soaking, and were quick to start talking again. But my planned speech broke apart fast. He really started going off. Okay, so now I’ll try to explain what was going on in the kid’s head, but you’ll have to go with me here. You might call his ailment… “Academic Heresy.” It is heresy that is birthed through research. The kid had read so thoroughly into the Bible that he started thinking it was all a lie.

When people like me (and him) get interested in first-century Christianity, we often get interested in the Christianities that didn’t survive. The lost heresies. We know a few of them. The Gnostics are particularly famous, though scholars now argue that the various groups lumped under that name were too different to be called the same thing. There’s also the Marcionites. And whatever community wrote the *Gospel of Thomas*. The Ebionites.

Anyway. From a historical perspective, heretical first- and second-century Christianities are deeply fascinating. But it’s tragically common for young people who gain an interest in these subjects to convince themselves they've uncovered some ancient conspiracy. That one of these heresies was actually the *true* Christianity. They claim to back it up with textual and material evidence. That’s what the seminary kid was up to. I suspected it from the beginning and had a speech planned to ease into it gently, but it failed, truly.

When I did finally get a chance to interrupt his antics, I tried to explain what was happening without hurting his pride. That’s not always easy. I told him these heretical texts are more “fun” than the New Testament, but less historically accurate. There’s near-universal agreement (even among secular scholars) that Paul’s seven undisputed letters and the Synoptic Gospels are the most accurate depictions of the historical Jesus.

Of course he brought up the *Hexing of the True Saints*. And of course that was his main focus. Okay, so there are a lot of heretical texts (I already brought up the *Gospel of Thomas*), but the *Hexing of the True Saints* is one literally never mentioned in academic circles, but cannot seem to be fully erased from all the dark caverns of the Internet. Most scholars don’t even know about it, and the ones that do won’t admit they do.

Let me explain some of the history here. All present-day Christian churches originate from what historians call the "Proto-Orthodox Church.” So the Catholic Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, all forms of Protestantism, are descendants of the Proto-Orthodox Church. Now at the time of the Proto-Orthodox Church, there were other Christian Churches that did not survive. They were silenced, and the Proto-Orthodox Church’s beliefs became dominant. These beliefs also happened to have the best understanding of the historical Jesus. The *Hexing of the True Saints* is some Internet-born document that claims to be authentic. Its (fictional) narrative purports that the Proto-Orthodox Church (although, of course, that’s not the name they used) crafted a hex (curse, jinx, spell) with a demon (I’ve forgotten its name) and used it to condemn all opposing Christians to Nod. The Land of Confusion. The heretics (or the “true saints“ lol!) were sent into a living state where they could never quite make sense of things and could only remember life in fragments that did not connect. They were confused until death. Those hexed could be identified by a scar on their heart. A scar formed from fire that does not burn but bewitches, or so the phony text says.

I had been in the seminary kid’s shoes before and so I wanted to steer him away from this kind of thinking. It pains me that I couldn’t keep things calm. We started arguing. We were throwing lines of Scripture at each other. Saying things like, “Criterion of Multiple Independent Source Attestation“ and what have you. I was never actually mad at him, but he got mad at me.

At some point we hit a stalemate and just stood there in silence, boots in the water, holding our cane poles, sometimes swatting away gnats. Then he said, “I’m gonna go take a piss,” which, mind you, was strange coming from a kid training to be a priest. They’re just people like you and me (Catholic priests and their students), but they don’t talk like that. Point is, I could see his faith leaving him. I could see it like the last shiver of smoke from a cold match. Not just his faith. His reasoning. His common sense. His ability to not always feel like something was off though he could never quite put his finger on what it was. He would be lost forever.

Now, I think this next part was a sign from God, but I don’t quite understand it. While he was pissing, his cane pole got yanked from the grass. Thankfully, it got snagged on some thicket and I had time to stomp down on it. I started hollering that he had a fish, but he didn’t answer. I asked if he wanted me to pull it in. Still nothing. He couldn’t have been that far. I acted on instinct and pulled it in. It was a decent bass. If it weren’t on such heavy line it might’ve broken it. It was a good fish, and we were catching nothing that day, and right when he goes to take a piss, he catches it. A good one. This happens a lot to fishermen (it’s almost a cliche now), but this time it felt like more than happenstance. But I don’t understand it.

So the kid never came back. I waited, I called for him and I looked around a little, but he was gone. Somehow I knew that he was just walking home, so I didn’t panic exactly. I packed everything up, drove off, and about a mile down the road, there he was, walking home. It was awkward, but I couldn’t just drive right past him, you know? So I rolled down the window and asked if he was okay. He said he was. I knew he would say that. I asked if he wanted a ride. He said no. I knew he would say that too.

I offered. There was nothing more to do. I told myself maybe the long walk would help him. Maybe it would give him time to reflect on what I’d said. Because I had warned him. He could not say that he wasn’t warned.

But now there was this other awkward part. I went to confession and told our parish priest about the incident. It’s uncomfortable bringing your priest into your personal drama, especially when the two of you are close, and especially if the person in question is a seminarian doing his residency (or whatever they call it) at his church. But I had to tell him. It sounds like tattletaling, but it was not—this was a serious matter and I had seen the consequences. I wanted to help the kid.

But then the priest stopped me halfway through my explanation, saying, “Wait, sorry, who are you referring to?”

“That kid in seminary.”

“Which kid in seminary?”

“The one who was here helping out.”

“When?”

“These past few weeks.”

“What did he look like?“

“Well,“ I said, “I can’t really remember.“

The priest sighed.

I said, “I met him at that event. Lots of people were there. My wife met him.“

He said, “Michael, we haven’t hosted a seminarian in years.”

I chuckled a little.

“You don’t have a wife. You’ve never had a wife.“

I couldn’t seem to respond.

He said, “I hope it isn’t *you,* Michael, who is having these ideas, again. A metaphor for yourself. Because as we have warned you, they come with serious consequences.“

He reminded me of how tempting it can be, for a young man, to get interested in the historical Jesus. He starts reading about the Q source, Paul’s seven undisputed letters, the Criterion of Dissimilarity. Then he finds some heretical text (something called the *Hexing of the True Saints* or whatever dramatic title its author gave it) that they can’t quite get rid of for some fucking reason. It always slithers its way back. And when that creeping young man finds the *Hexing of the True Saints,* he might start thinking there is some truth to its nonsense, he might start talking about it.

“And we can’t have that, right, Michael?“

I still couldn’t really speak.

“Touch the scar on your chest.“

It is from a burn. It was placed there by fire that is immaterial. It is shaped like something. I think it has been there for a long time.
