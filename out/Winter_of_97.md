In 1997, I lived in a small town in rural America. I was a cop there, although, to be honest, the job wasn’t exactly what you’d call 'challenging.' Back then, there were no real crimes. It was a quiet town where everyone knew everyone, and the biggest concern seemed to be whether the bakery’s bread would arrive fresh before the snowstorm.

Many said being a cop in that place was the easiest job in the world, and I couldn’t disagree. In nearly five years on the job, I’d responded to maybe half a dozen calls, none of them serious. A few times, we were called to look for Mrs. Greta’s cat, which had the bad habit of sneaking into the neighbor’s shed. There was also the time old Bill decided to sleep in the middle of the street after a night out at the town’s only bar.

Patrols were almost monotonous. I spent most of my shift drinking coffee in the car and listening to the police radio, which rarely broadcasted anything other than static. Sometimes I felt like the station’s sole purpose was to offer the illusion of safety rather than to actually solve problems. Everything was peaceful—or so I thought.

That winter of 1997, something changed. Something that, to this day, makes me question everything I’ve lived and seen.

January 14, 1997. I remember that morning well. It started exactly the same as always. I woke up, had my coffee, and got ready for another day at the station. When I arrived, I greeted my colleagues with a nod, grabbed my notepad and radio, and prepared to 'patrol' the town. I didn’t expect anything different that day, just more hours of calm and silence.

I got into the patrol car and started my usual route. I drove past Mrs. Greta’s house, which looked peaceful. No sign of the cat. I continued down Main Street, where some kids were making the most of the winter with a snowball fight. I drove a bit further and stopped in front of the bakery, planning to grab a hot coffee before continuing my shift. I didn’t even get a chance to turn off the car. The static on the radio was interrupted by a voice that sounded more serious than usual:

***– Steve, you there?***  
***– Affirmative.***  
***– We’ve got an emergency. Mrs. Greta called again.***

I sighed. The cat again. I couldn’t help but crack a joke:  
  
***– Her cat’s gone missing again?***  
***– No.***  
***– Then what is it?***  
***– She said she saw a stranger entering the Smiths’ house. The kid’s home alone; his parents are at work.***

I switched off the radio without a second thought and hit the gas. I arrived at the scene in under a minute. As soon as I parked, my eyes went straight to the Smiths’ house. The front door was closed, and the upstairs windows were open, letting the cold wind in and causing the white curtains to flutter. It was an ordinary scene, almost tranquil, as if nothing could possibly be wrong. My eyes shifted to the neighboring house—Mrs. Greta’s. There she was, just as I’d imagined, peering through her window. Her face barely visible behind the curtain.

I stepped out of the car, adjusted my belt, and walked up to the Smiths’ front door. I stopped and called out:  
  
– ***Boy! You okay in there?***

My voice echoed loudly, but there was no response. I waited, watching the upstairs windows, but there was no movement. Just the sound of the wind and the fluttering curtains. I decided to move closer. I quickly scanned the surroundings, making sure there was nothing suspicious outside, then knocked on the door. The sound was sharp and dry in the morning silence. As soon as my hand left the wood, the door slowly creaked open, as if it had only been resting on the frame.

The door swung fully open, creaking until it hit its limit. Inside, the living room was completely dark and empty. The pale winter light filtered through the windows but didn’t do much to illuminate beyond the entrance. Everything seemed quiet—too quiet.

For the first time in my career as a cop, I felt genuine fear. Not the rational kind of fear you feel when faced with a clear danger, but something else entirely. A fear that came from the emptiness, from the lack of answers.

I was supposed to be brave. It was my job, after all. But there, standing in the doorway of that dark house, I felt paralyzed. A chilling cold swept over me, and I couldn’t tell if it was the wind blowing through the open windows or something deeper. With a firm hand, I drew my weapon and stepped inside.

I began searching each room on the ground floor, one by one. The kitchen was spotless, with dishes neatly arranged in the sink and a kettle on the stove. The dining room was just as tidy, chairs pushed neatly under the table as if the space hadn’t been used in days. Nothing out of place, nothing to explain the oppressive feeling that gnawed at me.

– ***Boy, this is the police! I’m coming upstairs!***

Then, I looked toward the staircase. It rose steeply, the white walls marked with small childlike scribbles—probably drawings from a younger age. I took a deep breath, adjusted my grip on the weapon, and began climbing, step by step.

At the top of the stairs, I found a narrow hallway. There were three doors. Two were completely closed, and the third was slightly ajar. Light spilled through the crack, casting a narrow beam onto the wooden floor.

I approached the partially open door, my steps slow and deliberate. The hallway seemed to stretch longer with each step, the sound of the floorboards creaking under my boots amplifying the tension in the air. My heart was pounding so loudly that I was certain anyone inside could hear it.

When I finally reached the door, I stopped. I took a deep breath, my hand trembling slightly as I pushed the door open with my fingertips. The hinges creaked softly, revealing the scene inside.

And that’s when I saw something I will never forget.

The boy was sprawled on the bed like a broken doll. His body was drenched in blood, so soaked that the deep red seemed to have merged with the fabric of the sheets. His eyes were wide open but lifeless, fixed on the ceiling with an expression of sheer terror, as if he had witnessed something his mind couldn’t comprehend before he died.

My gaze traveled to what remained of his right arm—or rather, what didn’t remain. It ended in a grotesque stump, the flesh torn and jagged, with pieces of muscle and bone exposed. It looked as though the limb had been ripped off, not cut. The brutality of the act was evident in the blood spattered across the walls and floor, as if something had taken pleasure in the carnage.

I was frozen, my eyes locked on the boy. Ten long seconds passed, an eternity where the world seemed to stop. But then, something in the corner of the room caught my attention. A shadow I hadn’t noticed before, moving slowly.

My heart raced as I turned my gaze. There, crouched in the corner, was a figure I hadn’t seen when I entered. It was thin, skeletal, its skin pale and sickly. Its head tilted unnaturally as it stared at me with glowing yellow eyes.

Before my mind could fully process what I was seeing, a sound reached my ears—a slow, wet chewing that made my stomach churn. That’s when I noticed what it was holding.

The boy’s arm.

The creature held it like a predator savoring its prey, its sharp teeth tearing through the flesh effortlessly as blood dripped from its chin, pooling on the floor. It didn’t stop chewing, but the most terrifying thing was that its eyes never left mine.

Suddenly, it stopped. It dropped the boy’s arm onto the floor with a wet thud, and silence enveloped the room. For a moment, it felt as though time had frozen. Then, it lunged at me with impossible speed.

Instinct took over. Despite the shock pounding in my head, my hand squeezed the trigger twice. I saw the bullets hit its chest.

It staggered, but its weight still crashed into me like a runaway train. The impact knocked me to the floor, my body slamming hard against the wooden boards. The creature fell on top of me, heavy and lifeless, carrying with it a stench of blood, rotting flesh, and something I couldn’t identify.

My breath was ragged, and for a moment, I thought it was still alive. But it didn’t move. I pushed its body off me and scrambled away, my hands trembling as I grabbed the radio clipped to my belt.

– ***This is Officer Steve! I need backup... now!***

After that, everything became a blur. I can’t recall all the details clearly. Just flashes: the red and blue lights of the patrol cars reflecting off the snow, paramedics carrying the boy’s body out on a stretcher covered with a white sheet. And that thing... that thing they took out of the room.

I don’t know what happened to it. I don’t know where they took it or what they claimed it was. And to be honest, I’m not even sure if that thing was human. The shape, the smell, the way it moved... All of it defied any logical explanation I could offer.  
  
Time passed, but the memories remained. They never left me, not for a single moment. I went back to the station in the following days, but something inside me had changed. The sound of the radio, the weight of the gun in its holster, even the uniform I wore - all of it felt suffocating.  
A few weeks later, I resigned. I couldn’t bear to wear that uniform anymore; I couldn’t stand stepping into that patrol car again. I ended up moving to New York, where I could lose myself in the crowds and try to forget.  
  
Today, I’m 47 years old. Two decades have passed since that cold morning, and I’m still in therapy. Every week, I sit across from a therapist and relive every detail of that day, trying to make sense of what happened, trying to convince myself that maybe I imagined things—that the creature in the room wasn’t real.  
But I know it was. The smell, the sound, the cold touch of its body as it fell on me... That wasn’t something my mind could create.  
  
And even now, when I wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes I still feel those eyes watching me in the darkness.
