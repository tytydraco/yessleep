&#x200B;

This is Pete, posting yet again, this time from a hospital and a laptop my friend, Carl provided. I’m not the only one who ended up here after what went down. We got back only recently and typing while dealing with broken ribs is not easy. Thankfully, I have a little something to take the edge off. I should probably begin where the last post left off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since the day after Halloween, we spent our time preparing. Nobody, not even Zohl knew what to expect which fueled our collective nervousness. He only had a vague idea based on rumors he heard during his travels. Apparently, there are many different kinds of returned consisting of different species. The same thing happened with his planet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When they are someplace long enough, that’s when the card trees are sent out to collect the populace and take them back to Indefermast’s home. What it does with them is unknown. Chances are it’s nothing good. We asked Zohl how the orbs will come into play and he told us that there are places in its home where they can be placed to weaken it.  With a fuckton of weapons at our disposal, we were finally ready to face our ultimate foe.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson didn’t want to go with us for understandable reasons. He’d been having conversations with Zohl and collecting enough information to send back to HQ. Upon the day of our arrival which was yesterday, we went to open the card tree in Carl’s basement.

&#x200B;

“This is it,” Stevenson said. “Not that it’s my concern, but are you sure you all want to go through with this?”

&#x200B;

“Believe me if there was any other way we could save everyone, we’d take it,” I replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He looked down and then back to me and nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Best of luck to you all then. I’m finally leaving here after this and contacting HQ. I think they’ll be quite pleased with the information you’ve given me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He glanced at Zohl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“By the way, I have to ask, how exactly do you all plan on getting back?”

“I’m sure we’ll figure something out,” Carl answered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With that, we opened the card tree back up and went in it. The light, already blinding, somehow became even brighter. It was so intense, I could see my bones through my arms. We were being pulled, swirling to a center point like in a toilet which fits since this is a pretty shitty situation. When the light faded, imagine our shock when the place we found ourselves in was an almost exact duplicate of our town with some key differences.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The buildings were all the same. However, they were all on different planes. We could see houses and shops on spaced-out floating pieces of land. The sky was a dark green and reminded me of a flowing river. The void below which gave me serious vertigo was nothing except endless darkness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hang on, are those Christmas lights?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I squinted and could see them covering buildings and other decorations on properties. This was bizarre, to say the least.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We can focus on that later,” Carl said. “Right now, we need to see if anyone else is here.”

&#x200B;

“Where should we start?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“I suggest somewhere important,” Zohl replied, “but we must be careful. Indefermast is lurking here somewhere.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He didn’t have to say that twice. If any of us saw him, it would be lights out for us mentally. On top of that, who knew what else we’d have to deal with? I looked up and didn’t see any kind of way back from where we came. While not surprising, it was disappointing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How do you suppose we go about getting around?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That question became secondary to what happened next. People weren’t the only things the card tree took. From behind some houses came a bunch of flying creatures and two long-neck monsters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Of course,” I said, heart steadily beating faster.

&#x200B;

“Get your ammo ready,” Carl instructed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We made sure to bring regular runed weapons in case we ran into any threats that might call for them. As the creatures flew at us, we shot them all and they didn’t fall so much as drift down to the void below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are you guys seeing this?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Gravity here must be weaker,” Zohl replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was both a good and bad thing. Good because it meant moving around wasn’t going to be as difficult as we thought and bad due to the fact dangerous shit could reach us more easily. Speaking of, the two long-neck creatures were joined by ten more.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, I don’t like these odds,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was right. Even with Zohl, going up against that many at once would be walking into a slaughter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I believe taking shelter would be our best course of action,” Zohl said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The monsters jumped from where they stood, almost gliding in the air toward us. One upside was that as long as our feet were on something solid, we could run like normal and therefore move faster than things in the air. The issue with that is given that they are called long neck creatures, their reach was a significant concern. One snapped at me and I ducked it, cursing. To make matters worse, we were quickly approaching an edge.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We could only hope our next course of action wouldn’t be our last. Closing my eyes, I let instinct take over and we leaped from it. The sensation was odd as if we were being pulled by an invisible bungee cord. We reached another piece of land, much to my release only to find a shitload of returned crawling out from behind some trees above us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh come on.” I groaned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They swarmed us and if that wasn’t bad enough the long neck monsters were still on our asses. Nonetheless, we still fought, firing and stabbing. Despite our efforts, we were quickly being driven back to the edge. We couldn’t jump either since we needed a running start. Thankfully, we were aided.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shots rained down from nearby roofs, eliminating most of the returned and wounding the long-neck creatures. We seized the opportunity and finished them off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Holy fucking shit,” we heard a welcome voice yell. “I can’t believe it’s really you guys.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was Chuck, along with Sam and other cops. Our relief was immense.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You guys are alive?” Nick said.

&#x200B;

“Give us some credit,” Chuck replied, “but this isn’t the place to talk. Follow us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We made our way to them and they lead us to the police station. I should clarify when I mention any place that was back in our real town, it isn’t actually that place. Rather, it’s a replica of it. Everything was a lot closer together so at least we wouldn’t have to do a lot of running. We reached the station which was covered in Christmas lights.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So, this is the alien huh?” Chuck asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl introduced himself and said it was a pleasure to make his acquaintance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Likewise, you know we were asked a lot about you by those government guys.”

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah, are any of them here too?” I inquired.

“Yeah, they’ve been answering to some guy called Blue.”

&#x200B;

“God damn it.”

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

“Nothing, it’s just that we’ve met him before and he isn’t exactly fond of us. Anyway, what else can you tell us? Is everyone alright?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The answers to those questions worried me. Chuck grew solemn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We have lost some people. Mike has and so have others.”

&#x200B;

“Are Alonzo and Donelle okay?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could feel my hands tremble before he replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, don’t worry, they’re fine.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I realized I was holding my breath and exhaled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What happened to the others?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chuck looked to Sam who shrugged and then replied while he went to get something in the other room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The runes weren’t on the buildings when we got here, but luckily we've managed to paint them on. It wasn't easy, though. A lot of us were killed while doing so. In fact, we lost over half our guys here."

&#x200B;

"That's awful. How have most of the deaths happened?"

&#x200B;

“Creatures originally from town and the ones who died to them were the lucky ones.”

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry. Lucky? Then how did the others happen?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sam and Chuck exchanged a serious glance before the former replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They saw things that broke them.”

&#x200B;

“Inde?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

“Who?” Chuck replied.

&#x200B;

“Oh, yeah, Indefermast is the thing that runs this place. We call it Inde for short.”

&#x200B;

“Well, it isn’t the only thing here. Luckily, we’ve noticed a pattern of when they arrive. Time is weird here, but we’ve managed to keep track as best we can. A few years have passed back home, right?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, is that why you have all these lights up?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The station was decorated with Christmas lights and a fake tree with presents under it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We have to keep our spirits up somehow. If we didn’t, we all would have perished a long time ago,” Chuck said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl chuckled which was shocking. We didn’t even know he could laugh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Your species’ tenacity is remarkable. Even in a place like this, you’re managing to survive through your traditions.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He wasn’t wrong. Case in point, Christmas in one of its early stages as Saturnalia was invented to help people get through the winter. Now, here we’re doing the same thing here to help us stay sane.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Something tells me, it is this that will ultimately serve to secure our victory,” Zohl went on.

&#x200B;

“Hang the fuck on,” I said with bewilderment. “You’re telling us how we’re going to win basically boils down to…Christmas spirit?”

&#x200B;

“Yes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a heavy silence for a moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright,” I murmured, throwing my hands up and then letting them fall to my side.

&#x200B;

“By the way, we have food if you’re hungry,” Chuck told us.

&#x200B;

“Later,” Carl replied. “First, can you show us around? We want to meet up with the others.”

&#x200B;

“Sure thing. We need to hurry, though.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chuck led us outside and we followed him, hopping over the void as necessary. Then finally we got to a sight for sore eyes. It was Formaggio’s, floating ahead of us. As much as I hate to admit it, knowing I was about to see them again did make me emotional. I suppose now is as good a time as any to explain why I see them as second parents.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You see, my mom and dad both worked for some crime lords. Through a series of events they ended up meeting and eventually falling in love. Obviously, by the time they realized yours truly was on the way,  it wasn’t a good idea for them to raise a child with a target constantly on their backs. Therefore, they got away, far away, eventually finding out about our town and moving to it. Unfortunately, while they managed to escape the mob, the law was another story.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They’d actually stolen a sizeable amount of money from their bosses both of whom ended up dead in a shootout. It took them nearly sixteen years to track my folks down and by then they’d already spent the money on the house and expenses. The day of their arrest was a difficult one for me. Imagine my shock when I found Sam and the Formaggios waiting at my home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They explained things to me about how my parents were arrested in the middle of a job. Part of me wished one of the creatures in our town could have intervened and stopped ut. Such was not the case. I attended both of their trials and their sentences were either to sell everything they own and give up their savings to pay off the legal fees. The second option was jail.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They chose the latter and for over a decade now they’ve been in prison for me. I was devasted when they were taken away and my old anger flared up when I saw them being cuffed. If it weren’t for Chuck holding my arm, I would have lashed out. This is where the Formaggio’s come in. Since I was too young to claim ownership of our house, they let me live with them and gave me a job.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was so fortunate to be working for some honest people. Nowadays, I know that’s rare, but believe me when I say the Formaggio’s truly rewarded my hard work. By the time I was eighteen, I’d saved up enough to maintain taking care of my parents’ house which was now legally mine. With the exception of the time we spent on Ivan’s property, I always made sure to call my parents as often as possible. The reason I haven’t mentioned this until now has to do with me not liking to share sappy shit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know this will sound horrible to some. I didn’t mention I would be going here to them. How could I? You probably wouldn’t either. I understand not knowing can be the worst experience for people.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, if they knew what we were going up against and what might happen to us while we were here, something tells me they’d want to forget immediately. We made our way to the front door of the pizza shop and went in.  Zohl told us he’d stay outside and keep watch for us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Formaggio’s mouths fell open upon seeing us and then they rushed over for a proper greeting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“My god, is it really you guys?” Alonzo asked in disbelief.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, long time no see,” I replied. “Sorry, we’ve been gone for so long.”

&#x200B;

“We were beginning to think you wouldn’t make it here,” Donelle said.

&#x200B;

“Wasn’t easy we can tell you that,” Carl responded.

&#x200B;

“We can only imagine. So you and Pete have been living together all this time?”

&#x200B;

“And dealing with the freakiest shit you can imagine,” Nick spoke up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They turned to him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do we know you from somewhere?” Alonzo asked.

&#x200B;

“Hang on. You mean you don’t remember me?”

&#x200B;

“Should we? Now that you mention it, you do seem kind of familiar.”

&#x200B;

“He’s the hire from a couple years ago,” I explained. “He was crashing at my place.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Fomraggios’ eyes lit up with recognition.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah,” Alonzo said, “I remember you now. Sorry, we’ve been through a lot of employees over the years.”

&#x200B;

“I take it you guys didn’t remember me either?” Nick asked Chuck and Sam.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chuck stared at the floor while rubbing his neck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I felt like I should, but I couldn’t for the life of me think of where I knew you from,” he said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick wasn’t offended.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s alright. I wasn’t in town long before we left. I wouldn’t mind working for this place again, though.”

&#x200B;

“We’d like that a lot,” Donelle said. “Is there anyone else we’re forgetting about?

&#x200B;

“Oh right, should we get Zohl in here?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Who?” Alonzo replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We stepped aside so they could see him outside. Instead, their expressions were blank.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are we supposed to be looking for something?” Donelle asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Confused, we turned and saw that Zohl was no longer where he was before. Instantly, my ‘be weary of scary shit” alarm was ticking. I glanced at Carl and Nick who were of a similar attitude.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You guys got any weapons?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In response, the Formaggios pulled out two shotguns from under the table.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Plenty,” Alonzo replied, “I take it we have a fight on our hands?”

&#x200B;

“Possibly, even if it’s a minor threat, be on guard,” Sam said.

&#x200B;

He took out his radio and spoke into it. When he did, we heard loudspeakers from outside, projecting his voice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Everyone, please be aware. We may be dealing with a low-level threat. Stay in your homes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He put his radio away. Then we headed outside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We dealing with anything dangerous to see?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“No, those are the larger ones and they tend to announce themselves more,” Chuck replied, “but the smaller ones are still ugly as sin.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zohl?” Carl called out only to be greeted with dead silence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced at Nick who returned my gaze and we kept our hands on our guns. A noise like moaning static came from below us. Carl put a finger to his lips and we inched closer with our weapons raised. Suddenly, something shot up in the air and landed in front of us. It was Zohl and he was all kinds of fucked up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Cuts were all over his body, leaking purple blood. His suit had been shredded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh my god,” Nick exclaimed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl knelt beside him and put his ear to his cheat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Don’t worry. He’s still breathing,” he informed us.

&#x200B;

“What could have done this to him?” I asked, my grip on my gun tightening.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That question was answered by multiple tentacles shooting over the edge of the property. They were black with spiny feelers covering them. Its head rose revealing a spider-esque face covered in scales.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh shit, I hate these things,” Chuck said. “Don’t let it touch you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its tentacles shot toward us. We were quick to react, raising our weapons and firing. While our bullets did hit their mark, whatever damage the creature sustained healed rapidly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, how do we kill this thing?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“There’s a certain spot on it you have to hit,” Sam replied. “The issue is exposing it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By squinting we could see a faint pulsing red light under its stomach. It was a safe bet to assume that was its weak spot.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alonzo, Donelle, can you get Zohl out of here?” Chuck asked.

&#x200B;

“Who?” Alonzo replied. “Oh, right, the alien. We’re on it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seeing this, the creature attempted to swipe at them. I ran, squeezing off more shots as I did. Now its attention was focused solely on me which while certainly not ideal, did allow enough time for Zohl to be carried to safety. As good as I was doing, I couldn't hit all its tentacles. One managed to scratch me and my muscles immediately seized up and my gun dropped from my fingers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pete, what’s wrong?” Nick yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could hear the others running to help me. Unfortunately, they weren’t fast enough and I was as vulnerable as an upside-down tortoise. The monster wrapped a tentacle around my waist, lifting me. I willed for any part of my body to move to no avail. Its mouth opened wide, exposing its weak spot.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had another gun attached to my belt. If I could just grab it, I would be able to finish this thing off. Suddenly, I felt a small pinch in the back of my neck. Some feelings returned to me. I could move again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Holy shit, I could move again even if doing so sent pain shooting up my arm.  I didn’t waste another second. I pulled out my other gun and fired a round into the creature's mouth, hitting its weak spot. Its grip loosened and I squeezed the trigger again. It finally dropped me and I landed on my feet while it sank bank into the abyss while letting out dying gasps.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Feeling the back of my neck, I pulled something from it that turned out to be a dart. I shot a questioning glance at the others.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s to counteract the paralysis,” Chuck explained.

&#x200B;

“It still hurts to move.”

&#x200B;

“That’ll wear off. Just try not to move much when we get back.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zohl was helped back inside the restaurant along with the bag of orbs and we were treated to some special pizza while Carl tended to his injuries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Here you go,” Alonzo said, setting the pizza on the table before us.

&#x200B;

“What kind of pizza is this?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It seemed to be your standard pepperoni only something about was different.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ve had to do a bit of improvising since we’ve run out of some things,” Alonzo explained.

A large portion of the business in town were currently operating as farms. Special lights were installed in them to help make plants grow and therefore, provide food.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s impressive,” I told him,” but where are you getting the water for them?”

&#x200B;

“From anywhere really, every business and house still has its utilities. We aren’t sure why. Some think it has something to do with us still being connected to the real world somehow.”

&#x200B;

“Now that you mention it, I was wondering how the lights in here were still on.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, anyway, why don’t you have a slice? It’s vegan cheese with tofu pepperoni on a cauliflower crust.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Was the vegan pepperoni pizza as good as the genuine article? If I answered yes, I’d be lying. For what it was, though, it was pretty damn good. I honestly wouldn’t mind having it again sometimes or some of the other pizzas they’ve come up with. My favorite among the new vegan items we have is the jalapeno mushroom calzone. Matter of fact, I have one with me right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I also have a laptop that was brought to me from home on which I’ve downloaded some Christmas specials. This along with the calzone and weed has served as a decent distraction from the shit I’ve seen. A lot of it, I wish I could forget. The things I witnessed there aren’t leaving my memory in time soon. I’ll have to finish this tomorrow, though.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I need to get to bed before the drugs wear off. [Good](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) night, [everybody.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
