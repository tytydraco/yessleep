It started as a fantasy.

  


I live alone. I have for almost a year now. Since last August, I think, though the months have started to blur together in the silence. 

  


There was someone before—a man I almost loved—but that ended like most of my relationships do: quietly, slowly, with nothing to bury, yet somehow still a body to grieve. 

  


He moved out, and I stayed.

  


The apartment felt bigger after that, but not better. The shadows changed shape. My reflection stopped looking like someone I recognized. 

  


It was like the walls began leaning in with breathless curiosity.

  


At first, I filled the space with music. Podcasts. Audiobooks. Something to give the silence a voice that wasn’t mine. 

  


But eventually, even that became exhausting. Noise didn’t fix the loneliness—it just reminded me how loud it could get in here when no one’s coming home. 

  


No footsteps. No laughter muffled by distance. Just the hum of the fridge and my own breathing.

  


I started walking around the apartment more. Rearranging bookshelves. Alphabetizing spices. Buying plants I knew I’d kill. 

  


I even tried going on a date once, but I ended up ghosting the guy halfway through a glass of wine. He had kind eyes, but I couldn’t focus on him.

  


Nights got long. I’d toss and turn, sheets twisted around my legs, heart pounding for no reason I could name. I couldn’t sleep without something to pull me under.

  


 So I started using my hands. Not for love, not for anything romantic. Just pressure. Just release. Just to fall asleep and feel something that wasn’t panic gnawing at the edge of my ribs.

  


And then, somehow, the idea came.

  


What if someone was watching?

  


Not someone I knew. Not a lover. Not even a man, really. Just a shape. A presence. Standing outside my window, three stories up. Impossible. Imaginary. But thrilling in a way I didn’t expect.

  


But the moment I thought it, I came harder than I ever had. Like something cracked open. Like the idea itself was an invitation I hadn't realized I’d already sent. My legs trembled. My hand clenched. My chest bloomed with heat and shame.

  


I told myself it was just a passing thought. Something my brain threw in to spice up the routine. I told myself not to think it again.

  


But I did. Of course I did.

  


He had a mask the next time. White. Smooth. No eyes. He stood across the street, on the rooftop of the deli. He never moved. Never breathed. But I could feel him looking. Or maybe I wanted to believe he was.

  


I came again.

  


Faster. Deeper. With guilt snapping in my ribs like teeth.

  


Afterward, I lay still for a long time, staring at the ceiling. I tried to imagine a version of myself that didn’t do this. That didn’t need this. That didn’t finish with the thought of being seen by something she made up. That version felt impossibly far away.

  


I stopped the next night. Closed the curtains. Pulled on sweatpants. I told myself I was done. That this wasn’t healthy. That I was spiraling.

  


But when I closed my eyes, I could see him anyway. Just standing there. Watching.

  


And I came without touching myself.

  


After that, I stopped pretending I was in control.

  


I left the window half-cracked. Not wide open. I wasn’t stupid. Just enough. Enough for moonlight. Enough for him. I would walk into the bedroom and pause at the curtain like I was expecting a response.

  


He was closer next time. Standing on the fire escape. Still masked. Still silent.

  


I stared right at him while I touched myself. I didn’t blink. I didn’t speak. And when I finished, I whispered, “You’re not real.”

  


I think he tilted his head.

  


I cried in the shower. I told myself I was sick. Perverted. Delusional. I even tried praying once. It didn’t help.

  


He showed up anyway.

  


I stopped looking out the window. It didn’t matter. I saw him in reflections now. In the TV. In the microwave door. Once, in the corner of my glasses. Sometimes I would catch my own eyes blinking a second too slow, like something else was piloting me from behind.

  


I started keeping all the lights on at night. I bought blackout curtains. I unplugged everything with a screen. But somehow, his shape still found ways to appear. The flicker of candlelight in the mirror. A figure in the steam on the bathroom glass. I told myself it was stress, lack of sleep. But I knew better.

  


I tried not to touch myself. I really did. I tried distracting myself, sleeping early, even drinking. I started counting ceiling tiles to fight the urge. I wore gloves to bed. I stopped wearing anything cute, even around the house, like I could hide from him through shame.

  


But he came into my dreams.

  


And when I woke up, my hand was already moving.

  


I tried therapy. Once. I didn’t tell her everything. Just that I felt watched. That I was scared of myself. That I didn’t feel alone when I was alone.

  


She said I might be projecting unmet needs. That loneliness can trick the mind into splitting, creating shadows to fill voids. She smiled and said it like she was handing me a lifeline.

  


That night, he whispered in my ear while I came. “Don’t be ashamed. You made me.”

  


I couldn’t finish for days after that. I kept trying. I kept failing. My body rebelled without him. And when I finally gave up and begged out loud, he reappeared.

  


Standing inside the room.

  


I don’t think he moved. But the next time I blinked, he was gone. And my mouth was open like I’d said something I didn’t remember saying.

  


Now, when I undress, I don’t check the window.

  


I check the mirror. I check my face. I check my smile. It feels like a costume. My voice comes out wrong. Thin. Echoing. Like someone rehearsing.

  


Sometimes I say things I don’t remember thinking.

  


Sometimes I laugh, and it sounds like two people.

  


I started journaling, trying to reclaim some sense of self. But the words don’t sound like me. I read them back and feel like I’m eavesdropping on someone else’s secret. One night I woke up and found a page already written: “Let me stay.” I don’t remember writing it. But it was in my handwriting.

  


The mask is gone. I don’t see it anymore.

  


But I feel it. Like something behind my eyes.

  


And when I finish, I never know whose hand it was.

  


There’s no man in the window anymore.

  


He doesn’t need to stand outside.

  


He’s already inside me.

  


He always was.
