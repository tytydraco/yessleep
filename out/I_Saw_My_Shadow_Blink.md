You know that weird feeling when you just know you're missing something but you swear you grabbed everything on your way out the door? Sure some may claim anxiety or just general forgetfulness, but I would have sworn on my life that something was missing as my engine finally sparked and I slowly inched my way out of my driveway. And before you say anything, I had been planning on getting the spark plugs replaced for over a month, but every time I thought about it, they started working just enough again to give me confidence in pushing it back a couple more days. Sure I stalled out here and there, but the money I saved by ignoring the issue was worth every annoyance it brought. Soon enough, the sputtering of my engine filled my ears, breaking the seal on the the deafening silence I had been subjected to thus far. 

Normally my 45 minute daily drive would be accompanied by music, or occasionally a spooky stories podcast when new episodes dropped, but this morning I couldn't bring myself to drown out my thoughts with the bickering of two friends with microphones. That feeling... that... emptiness. It made me feel uneasy. I went over the things I needed for work in my head at least 100 times on my way in. Phone, wallet, keys, work keys, name tag, laptop, files, and readers. Everything was accounted for, all in the spots I had left them the night before. And now all thrown in the passenger's seat next to me. As I exited my neighborhood, I saw what looked like the aftermath of a poor guy getting kicked out of the house. A pair of shoes, shorts, and a tank lay on the ground, followed by another pair of shorts and some running shoes further up. As I approached the site of the chaos, a complete mess of clothes, shoes, and even a couple bikes seemed to be strewn about haphazardly, getting more dense as they approached the car door. Wife must have caught him cheating or something and left his crap by his car in a wordless way of saying "Get Out." Living alone had its drawbacks sure, but knowing that my stuff wasn't going to leave their final resting places until I came around to move them was definitely a bonus. 

My 45 minute drive took only 30, the lack of traffic being a welcome start to what I expected to be a gruelling Monday back in the office. Why drive an hour and a half every day to go to a job I don't like you may ask? Well, as mentioned previously, the whole "ignoring my issues because they cost too much to fix" tended to be a driving factor. Approaching the back entrance, I noticed some clothes that look like they were left by a bum or something. We had a homeless issue, especially in the city near the office. They don't usually cause much trouble but it could be annoying when they haphazardly left their stuff in their last sleeping spot after leaving the next morning. Looking closer, they seemed to be a bit nicer than what I was used to seeing left behind in an alley. Eh, I shrugged, if they want to pitch their donations, it isn't my place to judge. I just wish they'd leave their crap somewhere else. Preferably somewhere that wasn't a place of business.

Looking down in front of the door I saw one of our company key cards. I read it to myself, Pat Dorrow, and wasn't surprised. Pat had a tendency to be a bit of a clutz, but I figured I'd be a good Samaritan and give it back to him without causing a scene. As I cracked open the back door to "Tina's Terrific Taxes and Loans" I was surprised to see I was the first one in. While I had gotten there 15 minutes earlier than expected, usually Tina herself was there well before anyone else. As I poked my head around a corner to see into her office, I could see a jacket draped over her big boss lady chair, her laptop open on her desk, the screen flashing something red, and a paper coffee cup, the lid stained with her signature coral pink lipstick. Obviously she had been in this morning, or maybe she'd even spent the night. As I peered in and saw the army of empty coffee cups that accompanied the first, I began to assume the latter. She must have stepped away for a minute, but it was odd that her melodic voice couldn't be heard echoing down the hallway or muffled behind the break room door. 

Siezing the opportunity to relax for a few minutes before having to shoo away angry clients, I plopped down at my desk and hooked up my laptop into the dock carefully shoved in the back corner. The click of the plug seemed to echo in my skull, the lack of sound again becoming evident. I stopped for a moment, perfectly still, and listened. Not a single bird could be heard outside. The lights were off so the electric humming of the florescents was also absent. Even the low humming of the boiler, which could only ever be heard on days where we were truly empty, seemed to be dead. It was like someone disconnected the world, all power and life being flipped off. 

I could feel the beating of my heart grow heavier, the intense pumping of blood seeming to pulse against my head and wrists as my thoughts grew more dire. Where is everyone? Were there any other cars on the road this morning? When was the last time I got a push notification on my phone? At the last thought, I looked down. No new notifications, not even the automatic ones. Things were starting to get very uncomfortable. I could feel the stillness of the air around me, the warmth making my button down shirt stick to my skin, and making me itch like crazy.

Crazy. I had to be right? I must have gone crazy or something, that's why there's nothing here. It must be a dream or some psychotic break or something. That's the only thing that makes sense. I pinched my arm, the pain immediate and piercing. Just as quickly as it had happened, it dulled back to the same nothingness that suffocated me. Okay, so maybe not dreaming. But this can't be happening. I looked at the desk behind mine and saw my next plan: a letter opener. This would definitely knock me out of this hallucination or dream or whatever the hell it was. Hesitantly, I held it against the palm of my hand, and pulled down as quickly as I could. The pain, that was definitely real. Blood pooled and dripped against the lacquered wood, the deep red a stark contrast to the pearlescent paint meant to invoke the luxury look of marble. The fresh cut against the still air stung, the wound continuing to blossom new petals of red with every moment. Slamming my palms together in an attempt to slow the bleeding, I rushed to the restroom. 

I sprinted down the hallway to the only restroom in the whole office, leaving a trail of scarlet in my wake. As I approached, I saw the red marker on the handle. Dammit. Locked. I banged on the door, each bang of my fists accented by the sharp pain of the gash on my palm. After what felt like minutes of shouting and cracking knuckles to wood, I quieted back down. The moment I did, not a single sound followed. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and reached into my back pocket. My wallet was thin, but the few credit cards I kept would work on the door whether they were maxed out or not. I slipped it between the door and the frame and heard the click as I slid it down. Swinging the door open, I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see. But it wasn't this. 

A bright blue dress draped over the toilet and a prestine pair of sandals sitting below. I knew that dress. Hell I'd seen 3 times in the past week whenever Tina had an "important client" coming in to discuss business. She wouldn't have left it laying like this, not dipping into the pooled water and draping down to the dirty floor. She'd rather die than let anything happen to that dress, and she's said that to me herself on more than one occasion. With only the emergency light on, the shadows cast crept up the walls and towered above me. I tried to knock myself out of my stupor, turning on the sink and rinsing my hand clean of blood. Thankfully we kept the first aid kit in the medicine cabinet right above the sink. Without even looking up, I popped it open and pulled the gauze out to wrap up the self-inflicted wound. A long sigh followed, reverberating off the tile and echoing far more than it had any right to.

Once I was sure the gauze was wrapped tightly, I put everything away and shut the cabinet door. The mirror glinted as it caught the light from up above, glittering red on the barely illuminated wall. As I looked in the mirror for what felt like the first time today, I could see the panic on my face. I looked so small against the backdrop of shadow behind me, looming like a predator about to pounce. I closed my eyes and splashed some water on my face, the cool sensation seeming to snap me back to some level of reality. But as I wiped the water from my eyes, I saw it. When it thought I wasn't looking. I caught it just before it went back to being perfectly still but I know what I saw. My shadow. I saw it blink.
