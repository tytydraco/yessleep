I’ll admit, I was driving fast that day. Well, actually I drive aggressively most of the time. Even down roads like the one I was on when this incident happened. The road was rough, barely paved and had some pretty bad potholes. Not good for your car, I know, but I always pushed my car to its limits. Granted, I just figured if anything happened, I would just deal with it. But nothing could have prepared me for this.

As I approached an intersection, bumping fast down the road, a big dump truck with a loose tarp on top decided to turn right in front of me. I cursed as I pumped the brakes, while the truck hit a huge pothole. There was a loud bang as its left rear tire went into the hole, me close behind it, and the truck bed rocked crazily. The tarp flapped up and a huge wave of thick, dark mud sloshed out and onto the roof of my car, dripping over the front windshield and side windows.

Cursing I swerved to the right and bounced onto the side of the road, barely able to see outside the brown muck making its way down my windows. I stopped the car, heart pounding with anger and adrenaline, and got out. The smell of the mud hit me first, like the combination of putrefying organic substances, sulfur and ammonia. I pulled the front of my t-shirt over my nose, gritting my teeth in disgust as I went to the trunk. Opening it, I found an old towel. I grabbed it and went to work wiping off the mud from my windows.

Although not much time had lapsed since the brown, putrid gunk had slopped on to my car, I found it hard to wipe off. It was already solidifying. I grunted with the strain of scrubbing at it. I found myself panting, my muscles aching. I am no wimp, been a general contractor for most of my life. Still, I had to give up when I just barely got enough off my windscreen to see.

I decided to say fuck it, I had to go back to my house and use the hose on this abominable gunk. I got back in the car, and slammed the door shut. Immediately I noticed my car seemed to be lower to the ground, as if something heavy was pressing down on it. I started it up, and my car groaned. I had to give it more than the usual amount of gas to get it moving. I made a U-turn and headed home.

As I drove, my car started to make some ominous, groaning noises. The underside of car was scraping along the ground with every bump and pothole. I was beginning to be afraid I would not make it back before something really bad happened. And I had always been a fearless driver.

“Come on, come on,” I whispered to my straining, groaning car. “You can make it.”

Then I heard a loud banging, right above my head. I flinched, my nerves already on edge, heart pounding loudly in my chest. I glanced up to the interior roof of my car. My breath caught in horror. I saw that it had buckled in spots, as if someone with huge fists had been trying to pound its way through.

“What the fuck…?” I muttered, as I heard another flurry of bangs and saw the interior break open in spots, the metal poking through.

Just then I heard a crack in front of me, and where the windshield had mud it began shattering. My breathing was heavy with dread as I put the pedal to the metal while my car banged, groaned, and cracked around me, loud scrapes tearing at the bottom of the car that was being so brutally punished.

Concentrating on the road, I kept muttering under my breath to my dying car, each minute feeling like an eternity as I prayed to whatever gods would listen to get me home. When the glass started to pop out of the windshield, the shards hitting me in the face and hands, I swerved over to the side of the road, grimacing. I was about to bail on the car and call my girlfriend to come get me. I parked the car, just as I heard the roof of my car being punctured with huge, tortured tearing sounds. I reached for the door handle and yanked. But it would not open.

While I desperately rammed my shoulder against the door, I screamed as brown stalactites came through roof of my car. The tips, sharp as knives, pierced me in several places, right through my clothes, trapping me more. Chips of the windshield were now flying into the car. Terrified, I realized I was trapped, and would die in my car if I did not get out. I could barely move, as the solidified, lethally sharp mud pushed further into my car. The poor car groaned with the sound of tortured metal, as I desperately tried to find a way to escape.

Just then, the abused underside of my car made a huge ripping sound. I looked down beneath my feet and saw a hole opening up. The deadly mud came closer, and the pressure opened the hole more as I pushed myself down and away from its bite.

I could see no other way out than that hole in the car floorboards. But I am not a small man, I am quite broad and had some trepidations which made me hesitate, until the mud came even closer, forcing me to slide down in my seat, my legs going into the hole. I realized I had my first and only chance and stroke of luck. There was actually space between the underside of my car and the ground due to the rough terrain I had pulled on to.

Don’t ask me how I did it, but while my car buckled, glass shattered, and the brown mud knives of death tried to get to me I squeezed and screamed my way through that hole. My clothes were ripped, I was bloody, and I felt like I dislocated a shoulder when I found myself under the car. With the last of my strength, I groaned and grabbed the edge of the car, pulling myself out. I lay there in the dirt on my back, breathing hard as tremors went through me, my body burning from the wounds and the strain. But I was alive.

I heard a huge moaning, tearing sound coming from my poor car. I propped myself up on my elbows just as the evil mud caved in the roof completely, and the car split in half.

So guys, I was wondering. What kind of report should I make to the insurance company….
