It was yet another ordinary day at the mall, at least for a frequent visitor like me. When I entered, the lights appeared slightly blurry, as if the voltage was low. The familiar sights only reinforced that sense of routine: the endless crowd, the continuously rotating escalators, and kids driving those little minivans, crashing into each other violently for two dollars a ride. I stood on the ground floor, taking it all in. Despite the familiarity, there was an unease in the air. People moved in and out in overwhelming numbers, resembling an ant colony in constant motion.

Eventually, I walked toward the escalator leading to the second and then the third floor, where I usually had lunch. On the second floor stood two guys gazing at each other, their eyes almost bulging out of their sockets. They were blocking my way, so I had to interrupt.
“Excuse me, guys, are we good?”
They looked at me in plain surprise, astonished, as if they had been woken up from sleep. Then I stepped onto the escalator. It seemed to move a little faster than normal, and the handrails emitted a faint, steady hum, as though they were trying to communicate something.

People always seemed tense inside the mall. I often noticed moods shifting the moment someone crossed the doorway. I used to think it was just shopping anxiety, the kind that came with crowds and noise. Yet once inside, people behaved rudely and impatiently, snapping over small inconveniences, while after leaving, they seemed to change all of a sudden, like something had been peeled off them. A couple argued loudly near a kiosk, their words disproportionate to the issue, their faces flushed as if provoked by something invisible.

After lunch, I stayed seated for a while, staring at nothing in particular. The area felt unusually quiet, too quiet. That silence lingered just long enough to make me aware of my own breathing before it was broken completely.

It was broken by a call from Jason, my only friend in town. He sounded panicked. His aunt had collapsed. 911 wasn’t responding, and we would have to take her to the hospital ourselves. I rushed toward the escalator, only to find it completely still. It wouldn’t move. I waited a moment longer than necessary before stepping down and treating it like ordinary stairs. As I neared the exit, the door slammed shut without warning.

A guard stopped me and said, smiling calmly, "Sir, you seem to be leaving too early today."
I told him it was an emergency and that I would be back tomorrow. The door opened immediately. I ran to my car and drove straight to Jason’s place.

The next day, I parked in the basement as usual, right beside Robert’s car, the mall owner, who knew me well. Our cars always faced the basement entrance. I remember checking twice. I walked toward the elevator, and the moment I stepped inside, the doors slammed shut on their own. The sound was sudden and violent. The elevator hummed harshly as it carried me to the third floor.

I sat at the same restaurant and ate lunch like I always did, though nothing tasted right anymore. Every sound, the clatter of cutlery, the scrape of chairs, felt intrusive.

Jason’s aunt had died. If I had reached earlier, she might have survived. Jason believed I had delayed on purpose, even though I explained everything repeatedly. His accusations were soft, almost hesitant. I defended myself longer than I should have. The only thing that offered any comfort was a large coffee, followed by two diet cokes. When the urge to pee became unavoidable, I headed to the restroom just two shops away.

Inside, the space looked slightly distorted. The lights flickered unevenly, and then I noticed the guard again, standing at the sink and washing his hands while watching me through the mirror. His presence annoyed me for no clear reason. As he dried his hands under the air dryer, I asked why the escalators didn’t work properly and why the lights felt off. He replied that perhaps the mall was growing older, laughing softly as he added that the technicians would fix it soon. Before leaving, he warned me, almost kindly, that anger could do wonders. The words lingered longer than they should have.

After he left, I was alone in the restroom, though it didn’t feel that way. I sat down and began peeing, my thoughts drifting back to that call and the delay. Then something felt wrong. The toilet seat vibrated slightly, and beneath the stall door, I saw two floor tiles slowly swapping places. A faint grinding sound followed. I stood up immediately, unlocked the door, and stepped out. Everything looked normal again. I told myself I was imagining it.

When I later entered the elevator to head back to the basement, the doors took far longer than usual to open. When they finally did, I stepped out and walked toward my car. It was facing the opposite direction from how I had parked it. Robert’s car remained exactly as before. I opened my door, got inside, and drove home. I collapsed into sleep the moment I reached my bed.

The next day, I demanded access to the CCTV recordings. I needed to know who had reverse-parked my car. The manager said the cameras hadn’t recorded anything due to voltage fluctuations. I parked outside instead.

The mall was overcrowded, it was the weekend, and people flooded every corridor. As I stepped inside, the noise felt heavier than before. People shoved, shouted, and snatched things from one another, reactions arriving faster than reasons. The guard stood motionless, carefully observing the crowd. This time, the lights were clear, and the escalators worked perfectly.

My usual eatery was packed beyond capacity. People talked loudly, their words blurring into hollow noise. A man slammed his tray down over a missing chair. A woman cursed at a child for brushing past her. I left and headed toward the restroom.

Inside, something shifted. I leaned against the sink, staring at my reflection. My face looked unfamiliar, not monstrous, just emptied, as if something had been cleared out to make space. The mall hummed again, low and patient.

A dull thud echoed outside, followed by another. Voices rose, no longer forming proper words. Something slammed into a wall hard enough to make the mirror tremble. A scream tore through the building, and the restroom door burst open.

A man stumbled inside, gripping a baseball bat, his eyes wild. He raised it and charged. I caught the bat. For a brief second, neither of us moved. Perhaps we didn’t want that to happen; something within us was refusing to continue. Then I pushed him away. He lunged again, and I struck him once. He fell, motionless.

Outside, chaos had fully bloomed. People attacked each other with cutlery, metal bars, bare hands. There were frequent pauses too, as if people were trying to resist, trying to halt the violence, but something within them wouldn’t let them. I know what they must have felt like, because I felt it too.

Anytime someone would stop and regain their senses, the escalators would start moving rapidly, tiles shifting here and there. A buzzing hum filled the floor.

I was standing near the escalator when I saw Jason. He wasn’t himself anymore. He was on the lower floor. He took the escalator, which immediately leveled him up. I didn’t see him arrive at the mall. We were just two inches apart. He slapped me hard and began punching me. The guilt worked against me; I couldn’t hit him back. I immediately took the adjacent downward escalator. However, to my surprise, it threw me upward with violent force.

Jason was staring at me while I lay on the floor, his face right above mine, wearing an unusually wide grin. He was going to punch me in the face, but someone grabbed him from behind and threw him down to the ground floor. There, he was caught by other people who circled him. His eyes were locked onto mine. A tiny teardrop slid off his left cheek before the crowd tore him apart. I wanted to cry too, but it turned into anger.

It fueled the anger within me beyond control. And I kept killing until no one remained.

When silence finally settled, I stood there, breathing steadily. Footsteps approached, and the guard emerged, calm amidst the carnage, smiling as if satisfied. He unlocked the main doors and gestured for me to leave. As I stepped outside, he faded into nothingness. I collapsed, crying, ashamed, and confused.

A violent gust of wind tore a massive cloth from a nearby building, revealing an abandoned mall. Its silence felt deliberate and preserved. I ran from there immediately.

The rage hasn’t disappeared completely. I’m left with some permanent scars that don’t react to any treatment; they stay afresh, perhaps to keep the rage alive. It still arrives sometimes, before thought, before reason. Perhaps that abandoned mall had a survivor too.
And now, we are looking for each other.
