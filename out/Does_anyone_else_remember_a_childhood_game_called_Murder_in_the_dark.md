I think it was Jack's idea. Or maybe it was Mindy who came up with it.
You know, if I do try and really think about it .. well, maybe it could've actually even been me who decided we play it.
I've spent hours trying to pierce my memory back together, more to pass the time and distract myself.. But it's all irrelevant, It doesn't matter now. Maybe it never did.

Mabel was turning 30 and it was up to us to plan the party.
We were all nostalgic about childhood memories so we decided to go all out - Frogs in the pond (jelly cups with Freddo frogs), hot dogs and fairy bread, and we wrapped up prizes in newspaper for pass the parcel. 
Pin the tail on the donkey and Twister were set up ready to play, the spice girls were blaring on Spotify.

Mabel's eyes lit up when she walked into the room and her smile was worth all the effort we put in. We danced and played games, and as the sun started to set and it grew darker outside, someone suggested turning off the lights snd playing murder in the dark.

There were ohh's and ahh's, laughter as people remembered a game they most likely hadn't played since primary school. 
A collective chatter amongst us in agreeance to playing
Someone handed out cards, while were told the rules of the game. And then the lights were tuned out.

For those of you who don't recall, these are the basic premise of the games rules -


You'll need -
Pack of cards

Instructions -
Sort through a deck of cards and find the following - an Ace, a Jack, a King, a Queen, and number cards for the amount of remaining people. (i.e.-if six people were playing, you would need two number cards.)

Each card means something - the Ace is the murderer, the Jack is the detective, the King is the detective if the Jack dies, and the Queen is the detective if the Jack and the King both die. The number cards just walk around for the beginning of the game. 

Tell the players that all they need to worry about for the time being is if they get the Ace. Give a card to everyone. 
Nobody looks at each other's cards. 
Once they have their cards and have seen them, put them down somewhere out of the way for the next round.

Turn off all the lights so that it's completely dark. 
Everyone begins to spread out and walk about slowly, and try not to laugh or talk. 
Players aren't allowed to stick together in this game. 
During this time, the murderer is seeking 'victims'. 
When she/he finds someone alone, they quietly brush their shoulder and whisper, "You're dead." As an alternative, the murderer could clamp their hand over the persons mouth to avoid the person screaming, and then whisper "You're Dead".

The dead player drops to the ground, dead, and can not speak or move. 
The murderer may or may not hide the person they just killed in a hiding place. It is not advisable, however, due to the risk involved in getting caught. 
When a player sees a person lying down, they ask, "Are you dead?" The person simply nods 'yes' or shakes their head 'no', but they must tell the truth. If they nod, the person who found them shouts "Murder in the Dark!" and the lights are put on.

The murderer may not murder victims any longer and all the alive players assemble where the dead person was found. The players who are not present are noted as dead. The detective sits in a chair in front of all the others who are on the floor. He/she asks questions to each person. (i.e. where were you when someone yelled Murder in the Dark? Who do you think is the murderer and why? etc.)

When the detective has enough information and think they are ready, they say "Final Accusation" and ask one person-"Are you the murderer?" It is very important that the person answers TRUTHFULLY at the final accusation. If they are the murderer, then they must say yes. If correct players pick new cards and the game starts again. If wrong then turn out the lights and carry on.

Our rules were a bit different though. It was added in that it would be a last man standing game instead. We wouldn't have a detective - we would have a murderer, murderees and possibly one lone survivor. 
If someone did survive -Whoever who was still alive when the egg timer went off in 60 minutes - would be the winner. 
If the murderer had successfully killed everyone and there were no 'survivors' - than they had won the game.


I'll admit, it was spooky. There's just something unnerving about being in a room full of people that you cannot see but you can feel their body heat  or hear them breathing.
I began to walk around softly, careful to make as less noise as possible.
As I wasn't the killer - I had no 'good card' I was just a waiting victim, so I wanted to hide and try and bide my time staying alive as long as possible.
It didn't take long to find the first 'body'. I could tell it was Mabel from the way the long blonde hair trailed along the carpet. I whispered "Are you dead?" And I guess she mustn't have heard me because I didn't see her nod.


I moved on quickly, going into the spare bedroom. I didn't risk shutting the door behind me, I just went to hide under the bed.
There was a body already under there though, I felt the warmness of human skin as I clambered under the mattress, my hand recoiling in shock as I brushed up against someone's leg.
I didn't bother to ask whether they were dead, I mean I guess it was cheating a bit, but we were alone, and they were certainly doing a good enough job of playing dead it seemed just silly to ask.


I heard the muffled scream down towards the other end of the house, - the first 'victim' I'd heard to make any noise - and knew it was safe to make my move out of the bedroom to a better spot.

I nearly tripped on the bodies that were splayed out on the floor, in the hallway and the kitchen.
Whoever had the murderer card was certainly taking the game seriously and playing to the best of their ability. 
I had yet to come across anyone else walking around and was starting to think I might actually have a chance of winning, depending on how much longer was on the egg timer, of course.


I made a beeline to the kitchen to check how much time we had, it honestly felt like the game had gone on forever - and I was shocked to feel the broken pieces of the egg timer on the kitchen bench. I looked at the clock on the microwave - the green numbers burning into my eyes. We had been playing for over three hours.


Something didn't feel quite right.

I tiptoed back into the hall to Mabel, leaning down to whisper to her that we'd been playing way too long - but then I felt something wet and slippery on my hands when I knelt down next to her. It was blood. 
I stifled a scream as  my hands roamed and I realised the birthday girl had had her head caved in. 


I backed away slowly, tears streaming down my face as I quietly made my way to the front door.
I let myself out and ran across the road, banging on the neighbours door while constantly glancing behind me to see if I was being chased.

The neighbours nearly fainted when they saw me covered in blood and screaming, but they calmed me down by showing me they had double locked their door and called the police.

They don't know who killed all my friends. Everyone who was meant to be at the party was still in the house - slaughtered.

It's taken so much therapy and I'm still not sleeping at night.
I wish I could go back and help my friends. I didn't know, but the blame remains.

I got a letter in the mail today though.
It was a congratulations card, and written inside said 'last one standing - winner winner - care to rematch, Afterall the last game was so fun! I'll see you soon, when darkness comes.'

So my advice, don't play childhood games. They could have dire consequences.
