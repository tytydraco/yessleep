I didn’t want to move. I hated it above most else. But more than moving I’d learned to hate that hodunk, white-trash garbage fire of a town. The place was out of jobs, out of good men, and out of places where you could get a decent glass of white wine. And as I’d gotten older, those were the things I’d most come to appreciate in life.



Thankfully I’m not a complete dick-for-brains–unlike a certain not-good-man who might’ve jumpstarted my decision to get right the fuck out of that town–which meant that I planned ahead. I did my research as I looked for a new place to settle, and once I found an apartment I immediately applied for jobs nearby. Anything would do to start, and sure enough I got a couple interviews set up. Before long I’d signed on to start about a month after move-in day as the office manager of some midtier tech company.



When the day came, I left Mr. Dick-For-Brains a note that said “Sayonara, motherfucker.”



He’d know I was serious. It was an inside joke. 



The hard part was done. I’d left, and I would never be going back. A couple weeks went by before I could sleep through the night alone, and before I got used to the smell. Not a bad smell, just the smell of the town. Almost salty, although the ocean was nowhere near.



Eventually I found a good rhythm. I walked around a lot, exploring places. Small town as it was, there wasn’t a whole lot. Found a bar that served decent white wine, which was enough for now. 



The town was surrounded by a magnificent, dense forest. When you got close to it, it felt as if it roared at you, as if the trees–old as rocks–were about to fall right on you. I’m not sure what kind of trees they were, but they were much taller than the ones back home. Either way, I liked the forest, and one time I saw through the trees some high school track runners whizzing by, which reminded me of home as well. When I was young, when it had still been a home.



I’d run track myself in high school. I always liked it, but after you got good enough to be the best in school, there wasn’t much more to improve. Our school was small, so that achievement came fast. And when there’s nowhere to go, you get bored. And when you get bored, you do something else. And out there, *back home*, there wasn’t much to do besides drinking, smoking, and driving around. For most guys out there, their days were spent with either their dick or a gear stick tucked between their hands. For us ladies, the prospects were even more slim.



But I was an adult now, and the memories of running track came back sweeter than I would’ve liked. Burnt sugar. 



The next day I went out and bought some running shoes. 



A few days went by, and the shoes were still untouched; social anxiety had suddenly taken a hold on me, almost nostalgic in its absurdity and the thick venom it spewed into my veins, making the small so large and frightening. 



Although I’d gotten a good idea of the streets and paths of the town, I didn’t feel like taking a run there. For one, I’d only seen other runners take the path in the woods, so it almost felt like an unspoken rule that if you were to run, that’s where you’d do it.



But of course I didn’t want to go there with all them high school kids and make a fool out of myself. I reckoned I was dutifully out of shape, and looking like a decrepit broad who could barely do a mile felt like the disaster that would inevitably happen. Not that I–an adult woman–should care what some kids think. Old habits and all.



On the other hand, I’d gotten a pretty good idea of where the track started and where it ended. The entrance was up a hill that opened up into the woods just west of town, and it tumbled its way through the trees and came out onto an eastern field which led to a road that led back to town once more. Judging by how often I saw those kids, the trail couldn’t have been that long. Maybe a few miles. Anyway, I’m truly trying not to ramble, but to portray how my mind worked at the time; shuffling itself over and around itself, making up new scenarios, the droplets of which overwhelmed my capacity, forming a pool of self-inflicted social anxiety that stood right at the bottom of my throat and above my heart and lungs, well… it gives an idea of where I was at. What I’m saying is what they all say: I know what I saw, and I’m not fucking crazy.



I couldn’t sleep, but I couldn’t rest either, it was all just becoming a blur, and one night I looked at the shoes sitting at the foot of the door and said *fuck it, I’m going for a run, right fucking now*. And it made sense, too: no one else would be out there; it would be nice and cool; I owned a headlamp. Barring a fucking mountain lion biting my ass, it was a good enough plan.



Besides, if I didn’t do something to get that nervous energy out, I think I would’ve exploded, and when I explode, that’s when Mr Dick-For-Brains’s name would somehow show up on my phone. And i’d be back there again, in that loop, in all that I was trying to leave the fuck behind.



I didn’t even stretch. When I was out my front door, the town was dead quiet. It was cold. I thought to first walk up to the trail, but a warm-up jog was much more convenient. Besides, and I can’t stress this enough: *no one was outside.*



The streetlights didn’t follow me far as I made my way to the beginning of the trail, clicking on my headlamp and admiring the preciseness with which the light illuminated everything I looked at. I felt like a car–one that needed its oil changed and its tires replaced. My muscles teetered on the edge of cramping as they warmed up, and my lungs were heavier than I remembered. But my head was starting to clear. The cool air and the pure physicality of it all moved all those other thoughts to the sidelines; not gone, but at least they were no longer in the way.



At what I reckon was a mile in, I’d really hit my groove. My legs were locked into a pattern, my pace like the gears of a clock, each step falling into its place efficiently and smoothly. I cursed myself for not doing this earlier, and then I cursed hindsight and the curse of regret it bestows on everything good. Then I smiled, breathed in the forest air, and looked around at the dark forest around me, in all its moonlit calm. Life felt like life again.



It was up at the treeline, where the branches were thick and almost intertwined where I noticed a gleaming. Must’ve been the fresh sap that reflected the moonlight, I thought, as my legs pulled me further along, not saying yes for a stop to look at the scenery.



Yet something about it bothered me, and I couldn’t quite say what that was. Just one of those gut feelings, but I didn’t trust my gut. Or, more accurately, we had a complicated relationship. The decision to move was based on a gut feeling, but so was letting Mr. Dick-For-Brains into my life. So I let it slide, and brought my attention back to my breathing and the crunching beat of my feet drumming the ground.



The weird feeling had almost subsided until I saw it again, maybe half a mile later. It was lower this time, so I could see it better. Two points of faint light, gleaming against the dark sky and the black trees. As I moved closer, I kept my eyes on it, trying to figure it out before I passed it. With each step toward it, the shape around the gleaming revealed its form, lending itself to the light as well. 



It looked like a monkey. A really, really big monkey. Long limbs, strange and wide torso. It squatted on a branch, its eyes looking down. My gut said that the eyes were looking at me. Which in turn meant that, as I got closer, our eyes met. And when I was past it, I had to look back, I had to know if it had also turned to look at me, whatever it was.



When I did, my chest tightened, and my legs almost locked up. But I couldn’t stop running, I had to run faster.



Behind me, the treeline was awash with gleaming eyes, like an ocean of stars.



There must’ve been a hundred of them, all hunched up in the trees. Silent and unmoving. Watching me. Why were they watching me? How long had they been there?



As if in answer, I saw some of the eyes blink out like dying stars against the infinite cosmos. But they weren’t gone; they had simply dropped down. And they were running, too.



All I could think of was *fuck, fuck fuck*. The instinct wasn’t unfamiliar; I’d been chased and stalked and all of that shit before. When I felt like this, I knew it was best to get out as fast as you can. The problem was that I didn’t know where I was, at least not exactly. The only way out was forward, and as I tried to untangle my mind for how long I’d been running for, more and more eyes kept blinking out and then reappearing on the ground. My head swiveled back and forth as I looked back and kept my course steady and the trail under my feet. 



My lungs protested as I picked up the pace. Not because I wanted to, but because they were getting closer. Their step was light, yet all together they produced a rumble like an earthquake. I couldn’t keep it up, they were going to get to me sooner or later.



I didn’t want to know what would happen if they did.



So I ran. Perhaps for my life, as death itself was surely at my heels. Time lost meaning as pain grew in my muscles and my lungs like poison ivy, twisting itself around and telling me: *no pain is too great if it means you’ll live*.



And suddenly, there it was. The way out of the woods, the trail stopped where the field began. In the distance I could see the roadlights like angels. Of course there was no way to know if the creatures behind me would stop at the edge of the forest, but somehow I knew they would. Maybe it made sense, maybe it was pure hope compressed through and through into wishful reality. You might think you’re going to die, but you don’t ever believe you’re going to die.



Thankfully I was right. When I crossed the edge, the footsteps became lesser. I looked behind me at their eyes; most at ground level, some climbing the trees to get a better look. It was like a galaxy unto itself; a tsunami of stars. I thought I could feel the strange heat of their bodies, and smell their acrid sweat wafting in the air.



Once I got to the road I finally stopped running, and collapsed onto the road. My ears rang as tv-static curtained over my eyes. The next thing I knew, some guy was shaking me awake with one hand, dialing someone with the other. He seemed relieved when I came to, and once I could stand up, he led me to his truck. We sped off towards town.



I thought he was in a rush to take me to the hospital, but after a few minutes the guy eased up on the gas and slowed to a cruise. His eyes landed on me every once in a while as we drove, like he wanted to ask something, but didn’t know if it would be okay.



“You know,” he finally said, “I saw them.”



“Them?” I said.



“In the woods. They were waiting. Hoping you’d go back, I guess.”



My heart sank. It all came back. I was too tired for it, but my body still tried to prepare for fight or flight. I wasn’t up for either. I hoped this guy was safe.



“You… you know who they are? You’ve seen them too? The… the men in the trees?” I asked him.



The man fell quiet for a moment. Grave. 



“Unfortunately, yes. And I beg of you, never go back there. Not even during the daytime.”



To that I laughed, catching the guy off guard with my levity. “Look, you can be damn fucking sure I won’t be going back there ever again.”



He planted his eyes back on the road. “Right. Obviously.”



“But… who are they?” I repeated. 



He thought about that for a moment.
