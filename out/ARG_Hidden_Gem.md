Let me open with this. Do you like horror? Do you like args? And most importantly, do you like goblins? Or at least a potentially mentally unwell man dressed as one? Look no farther than @goblin_hour on TickTock. The dude is cooking up something wild and there's already theories and plot lines getting thrown around that I won't spoil. The video link below is to his most recent video that has his artwork that is very well done. His voice is very Corpse Husband esque. 

As I was told to add upon this post, I will elaborate some on the plot. The main character, Thatcher Field, appears to be broken into multiple personalities. Each manifests as a goblin. They have their roles. And they each seem to only show up on their own side of the screen. Clown on the left, Gravekeeper (as we found out his name today) in the middle and the Ghost on the right. Each is a manifestation of how he is handling the trauma of losing two family members. One of which appears to have been dismembered. Which was revealed in a custom card pack opening in an insane asylum of all things. 

He seems to be thriving in the new weirdcore realm. He has comments on videos that are getting 10k+ likes which is impressive considering he doesn't have that many followers. I don't really know what else to add without spoilers but I need to increase the word count to 500. The green ski mask hat is cool. He looks to be overweight which plays into some of the shots he performs. I have seem him say that he is intentionally cringe as it fits his asthetic. If you have any questions just give it a watch, seriously.

Now I will recount a tale to hit word count: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. Itâ€™s not a story the Jedi would tell you. Itâ€™s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create lifeâ€¦ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerfulâ€¦ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

Just check him out. I don't normally shill for anybody, but I have to say, this guy is a hidden gem. Here's his newest one, has a lot of art and that voice ugh ðŸ˜…
