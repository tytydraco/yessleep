I’ve always loved running in spring. April in my new town—a quiet place on the city’s edge, where rent’s cheap and farmlands stretch behind my house—was perfect for it. After weeks of chilly rain and clouds, the forecast finally promised clear skies, warm air, and blooming flowers along the jogging trails. It was Sunday, and I’d slept like a rock, dreaming of the crisp morning air I’d breathe on my run. My route was set: a trail through the fields to a small hill with a tulip garden at the top, where I’d snap a photo of the city skyline for Instagram.

The morning was everything I’d hoped. Sunlight spilled over lush green trees, and the flowers—reds, golds, purples—lined the path like a welcome mat. My shoes scraped rhythmically against the dirt trail, blending with birdsong and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. Each breath fueled my lungs, my pace quickening as I hit my stride. I felt alive, unstoppable, as I started the incline toward the hilltop.

Then things got… wrong. A dense fog rolled in, swallowing the clear sky. Strange for such a small hill—too low for altitude to shift the weather like that. The air turned chilly, not frigid, but enough to prickle my skin through my shorts and tee. I shivered, chalking it up to clouds blocking the sun, and pushed upward. My breath puffed white, and the trail seemed to narrow, the flowers fading into gray mist.

When I reached the hilltop, the skyline was gone, drowned in fog. So much for my photo. But that wasn’t what made my throat tighten until it ached. The tulip garden was obliterated—not trampled, but burst apart, as if something had erupted from the soil itself.

In the center stood a clump of… mushrooms, I guess you’d call them, but nothing like any I’d seen. They sprouted from a gnarled, ginger-like stump, surrounded by dozens of fan-shaped caps, broad as dinner plates. Their surfaces were moldy, brownish green with black patches that seemed to writhe in the dim light. The caps’ gills pulsed with a glow—not steady, but flowing, like bioluminescent veins tracing paths from stump to tip. It reminded me of deep-sea creatures, alien and wrong on dry land. The air around them hummed, low and unsteady, like a distant engine.

I should’ve turned back. But I couldn’t look away. My hands shook as I pulled out my phone and opened Google Lens, hoping for answers. Nothing. No Wikipedia, no images, no articles. Just one link, buried deep in the results. Curiosity got the better of me, and I clicked.

My browser flashed a warning: “This site’s security certificate is not trusted!” The red screen screamed at me to stop, but the mushrooms’ glow seemed to pulse in time with my heartbeat, urging me on. I clicked “Proceed Anyway,” half-expecting a virus. What loaded was… underwhelming. A barebones page, like something from the early internet, with a grainy photo of the same fungal clump and a single sentence:

*“Regarded by forgotten circles as a bearer of fortune; its presence said to soothe restless minds.”*

I paused to check the name of the webpage. It read – *“the mycorrhizal network”*

I was not a believer in charms and trinkets. Neither was I convinced that having a bunch of mushrooms at home would in some way magically lower one’s stress. Yet, I felt that something as unique as this should adorn my shelf and I did however, like having plants at home. Luckily, I always carried a pouch strapped to my belly during my runs for some emergency rehydration. So I grabbed a stub from the ginger-like stem, which had a handful of mushrooms, and put it in the pouch.

The run home was uneventful, the fog lifting as I descended, the sun returning like nothing had happened. Back at my place, I planted the stub in an empty pot, its faint glow casting shadows on my bedroom wall. I told myself it was just a cool plant, something to show off to friends. I showered, headed into the city to meet up with them, and stumbled home late, a little drunk and exhausted. Work-from-home Monday meant I could sleep in, but I needed rest. As I crawled into bed, I glanced at the pot. The mushrooms looked bigger, their caps spreading like fingers, but I blamed the alcohol and passed out.

I woke up in a cold sweat, so parched that my throat was hurting. I swallowed some saliva to ease the pain as I check my smart watch. It was 5:50 am, still 90 minutes for my alarm to go off. But what woke me up was the dream I had. I call it a dream because I slept and woke up exactly at the same place, so whatever transpired in between must have been whatever my mind imagined in my slumber, right? Because, what I saw, rather felt, no, *rather lived*, seemed so existent, that it could hardly be classified as a dream. It was a sensory experience, as if I was transported to a different world whilst my body slept in the world I know of.

It was the dream-world itself, which was the most surreal part of this experience. I was transported into a world full of fungi I got back with me from the hilltop. Only here, the fungi were giant versions of these. As tall as the tallest trees on earth. And as I walked, my legs seemed to stick to the ground at every step, as if I was walking on glue. The ground was moldy, of the same color as the ginger-like stump I saw the other day. The air was thick, humid and warm, like stepping into a greenhouse. But the smell was nothing like one. It smelled horrible, like a dozen corpses rotting in the summer heat. I lifted my hand to cover my nose. And found I had none.

I saw my hands; they were no loner the limbs of a human but fan-like caps of those strange fungi. They had their own gills. The pulsating glowing path, same as those mushrooms I got, same as the giant tree like counterparts in this world, was also present on my hands. I was horrified at the absence of my nose and the presence of sense of smell at the same time. I tried to scream in horror, but I couldn’t. I lowered my hand to where my mouth should have been, but I had no mouth as well.

I raised my hands to feel my head. I could only feel a giant mushroom cap, oyster shaped, with long, thick gills running over what should be ma face and neck, all over my body. How I could see, I do not know, but surely, I was able to see and experience all that was going on around me.

I could also feel, because I felt tiny droplets of rain falling on my body. As I looked up, I saw that these droplets were not falling from the sky, but from the giant mushrooms. They were small, almost miniscule, but visible, bright glowing. They were all over the place, as far as my “eyes” could see”. I looked around, trying to catch my bearings, of where I was, what was around me.

Then I saw, hundreds, if not thousands, of “beings”. Similar to me. Human-sized, glowing oyster mushrooms. Just like me, most of them were looking aimlessly, towards the giant mushrooms. Some were more focused, walking the best they could on the slimy, sticky floor, towards something, or someone. And some, which I could only make out as “beings” because they moved their mushroom limbs from time to time, were fixated on the ground, immobile, appearing more “mushroom” than all the others\*. But all of them, all of us, looked up towards the giant mushrooms when they rained their spores on us.\*
