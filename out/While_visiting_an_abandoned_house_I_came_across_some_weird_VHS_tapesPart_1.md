I basically lived in the world of Urban Exploration. 

I mean they thought of old abandoned houses and buildings with their own version of standing still in a time not theirs is what excites me. 

Everytime I go inside a building I would always keep a memento of what was inside. Though this new piece of time that I recently got in my possession I don't know what to do with! 

Like should I go to the cops?! Call the church likeâ€¦ i don't even know. 

It all started while I finally had the weekend off to finally explore an abandoned town a few miles off from where I lived. It's like whenever I an free to do so the universe trys to stop me. 

One time I tried to go and my car broke down. Another time the batteries to all my equipment mysteriously disappeared. 

But this time I said screw you universe. I'm finally going! 

So i packed up all my stuff, ordered a room at a hotel a few minutes away, and set sail to what I was hoping would be my greatest exploration. 

As soon as I got to the town i immediately got the creepy vibes. I mean, a ghost town with no one in it would sure make someone uncomfortable. But i also got another weird feeling, that someone was watching me. 

Every few seconds from looking around all the old rooms and stores i would look over my shoulder every two seconds. I just thought that it was just where I was by myself but Marty, my friend, had to catch up with work so he couldn't come. 

The place I mostly was excited about was a mansion in the outskirts of that town. 

I went their with my car cause I didn't want to walk all the way there. The place was two stories high and dated back to 18th century. Heard there was some problems maintaining the place which is why the building now left abandoned. 

As I pulled up to the front the European sculptures in the front was enough to give me chills. Their faces were half smashed in and cracks sprawling all around the body.

I went pass the fallen guard and went inside the mansion. It had the same musty smell that I was used too. Wallpaper and paint almost gone in most of the rooms that I've went in. Most of the pictures that were in frames was gone. 

Furniture looked scratched up and most of the tables and dresses were bare. I was dissatisfied. Looks like most of the stuff that was usefull in here was already gone by other explorers or teens. I went to leave until my feet slid in the floorboard by the front door! 

I got my foot out and as soon as I checked and saw that I had no serious injury i looked inside the floor. To my surprise there was a shoebox in there! 

Then suddenly I had that same feeling that someone was watching me. Which was impossible as I was the only one in here. I opened up the shoebox and found like 3 or 4 VHS tapes. I took all of them and went back to the car as there was nothing to be gained from this place. 

I stayed the night at the hotel and to my luck that one had VHS players In there rooms! I took one of them out and placed it in the player. 

The first one opened up to what look like a teenage girls room. I skipped through and all I saw was the girl and moments with her family and friends. As i got to the end of the tape i wondered if i should put in the second one? But with all the trouble I went through to go there I decided against my gut and put it in. 

The second tape started off WAY differently than the first one. The tape opens up in the parents bedroom while they were asleep. Then two cloaked figures stepped out from both sides of the bed. They were holding short curved knives. 

With one swift motion they both stabbed into the parents stomachs killing them. I was took aback by this that I jumped! As I kept on watching the camera glitched and then we were at the son's room. The boy was asleep as the rest and even though I know it was pointless i was yelling for him to wake up. 

To no avail another cloaked figure comes inside the room and stabbed the boy. The boy woke up with a face of pure terror as he laid back dead on the bed. I backed away from the television but my eyes kept on watching. 

As the tape continued we see the teenage girl on the dining room table. She was tied up and trying to fet free. Then 5 figures circled around the girl each holding a blade. Another figure then went up to the head of the girl and started caressing her face. 

She then poured a bowl filled with blood in the girls mouth. As the girl dranked the blood the main person uttered some words then folded her hands together. As the main person at the head of the table backed away the others tooked turns stabbing the girl! 

After the job was done they took a few steps back from the table. Then they all held hands and started chanting. As they were chanting i saw the girl and the table shake as the chants grow louder. Suddenly the lights in the building and the tape went off. 

I'm scared too watch the last two tapes. Or should I watch them then give them to the police? I need your [help](https://www.reddit.com/r/lingeringshadows?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1)
