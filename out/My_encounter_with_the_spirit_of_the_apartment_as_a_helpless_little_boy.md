The story I'm about to tell you is told from the best of my recollection. I can't be certain 100% of the story is how I remember it, but I can only be certain it is 100% of what I felt. I was just 4 or 5 years old at the time.

\*Assume all the dialogue from family is not told in English, but in our native tongue of Bisaya\*

In 1999 my family moved into a new apartment. We were an immigrant family consisting of myself, my mom and dad, and my Lola (grandma in most Filipino languages). My parents were both born in the Philippines along with my Lola, and I was born here in the US.

This was a pretty big deal for my family because it was the first time my parents could afford a place to stay solely on their income. Previously we stayed with my aunt and uncle which did not work well at all. My mom hated my uncle's guts and my uncle hated all of us. My aunt who's my mom's sister was powerless to stop the conflict between her husband and my mom.

Things went well for a while. I started kindergarten and walked to school everyday with my dad. But everytime we walked out of the apartment complex, we saw this ugly looking tree. It was at least 40 or 50 feet high and never seemed to have any leaves. Matter of fact, it didn't have any birds on it like the other trees, and every branch was thick and sharp. It was like lightning bolts scattering out from the tree. It seemed to watch us on our way in and out.

My dad worked nights at a department store and my mom worked in the day as an architect. So with school, I mostly saw my mom.

One day, my dad got laid off. Then things slowly took a turn. My parents argued at first. Then arguments became shouting contests, and soon they became violent. I don't know who started it first, but it was ugly.

I once saw while peering out the door of my grandma's room, my parents screaming. My mom threw food at my dad and my dad pushed my mom off of him. The screaming was so loud that a neighbor came to see if things were alright.

Later that night I went to the bathroom and I noticed something was off about the living room. It was dark and quiet, but something felt like there was someone there staring at me. I went to the bathroom, came back to my room, and slept.

The next evening our family had prayers. We were a devout Roman Catholic family like most Filipinos were, and we had prayers together every other night, praying the Rosary. I was playing with my toys a little louder and my mom grabbed my hands saying, "WE ARE PRAYING. THE DEVIL WILL GET YOU IF YOU DO NOT PRAY." My father lashed out saying. "Don't talk to him like that, he's only a child." My mom said. "OKAY, FINE! HOW ABOUT YOU GET A JOB THEN AND MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR HIM!"

An argument broke out as my Lola tried to calm things down. I ran to my room then my mom grabbed my shorts to sit me down. She yelled in my ear, "WE ARE PRAYING!." My dad grabbed her hand off me and told me to go to my room. My Lola took me and and my mom said, "YOU ARE ALL LETTING THE DEVIL IN THIS HOUSE. STAY!" The argument continued.

As my Lola took me into her room where I usually slept, I saw the tree outside the window. It was as if it was staring into our windwo from across the parking lot. I ignored it and closed my eyes and covered my ears.

Again, I woke up that night to go to the bathroom with a nasty stomach ache. I was very sleepy but also in pain. Next to me while I was sitting on the toilet, was the bathroom counter made of wood and marble. In the grain of the wood I saw what looked to be a devil with horns and a pitchfork. It stared at me like it was smiling at my pain and a hatred for me. There was no sound and no movement, but I felt it was talking to me. I felt something deep down being said.

"You're a disgusting little sh\*t stain you know that? Look at you. Your pants down with your little d\*ck hanging out. I've seen you playing with it, god don't like that. Where are you going to go, I'm here right next to you. Go ahead and run, you think they'll believe you? I am the spirit of this home and I see you. I'll have a surprise for you you little bastard. Disgusting little trash, you have no Jesus here."

I closed my eyes praying the prayer of Saint Michael as my stomach hurt more. I saw for some reasin with my eyes closed, flashing lights that looked just like the devil in the wood. And I felt that same horrible voice.

"LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU, YOU PIECE OF SH\*T! I am the spirit of this place, I will get your mom, and your dad, and your lola, and the little girl in your mommy's belly."

A week later my mom announced she was pregnant.

The fighting between my parents continued and some days they were a loving couple, as though nothing happened. Still, I felt a presence.

As I walked to school with my dad, the tree seemed to be even more alive. It seemed to stare us down with a hatred no little child could fathom. Some of the branches looked so sharm, it was going to kill me at any moment.

When I was being driven home from school in the rain, I felt something tell me to open the car door. For some reason I felt an entity tell me it would be cool to jump out and roll like an action movie hero, even though I knew it was a bad idea. "But your daddy's here," I felt something say. So I unbuckled my seatbelt, opened the door, and my dad grabbed me by my arm, reaching from the driver's seat, screaming at me to stop. I close the door, my dad drags me into the apartment, spanks me, and tells me never to do that again.

Months go by without anything other than the usual arguing. My mom would later give birth to my baby sister.

While my parents were away spending time with I assume their friends, I was with my Lola watching TV. My Lola was praying as usual and then I watched her take my sister out of her cradle. She carried my baby sister when I went to grab more toys from my parent's bedroom, and I watched her go to the front door. She struggled to open the door while holding my baby sister and I watched in confusion. My Lola then turned around and said, "be a good boy. Please be a good boy." Then she put my sister back in her cradle and continued praying.

On Monday morning, I was eating oatmeal before school while my dad went to shower. My mom walked out of the door after giving me a kiss, and when she closed the door, I noticed something strange about a shelf.

I don't know if it was the sunlight reflecting from the window, but I could have sworn I saw two eyes from behind the shelf. It was staring at me as though trying to get me to stop eating. I ran into my parents room looking for my dad and my dad was there, putting on his clothes for the day. And then behind me was my mom once more. She stared at me and my dad stared at her. More screaming erupts, something about the car, and then my mom grabs my dad by the neck as my dad holds her off.

I saw a strange red discoloration on the doorway. It was almost as if it was blood. I was scared and wet myself.

On Friday, my parents went out with their friends again and my sister was in the cradle while I was watching cartoons in my Lola's room. A force told me to take out my sister from her cradle, put her on the ground, and jump on her. I felt something control me, take her out, put her on the ground, and I stood above her. I saw fear in my baby sister's eyes until I heard my Lola praying very loudly; she was a scared 80 year-old woman. I got down, picked up my baby sister, put her in the cradle after giving her a kiss, and cried.

That Sunday, as per tradition for many Filipino families, we bring a priest to bless the house. The Filipino priest throws holy water everywhere and then I see the door to my parent's bedroom stained with blood once more. The priest seemed to notice saying, "what is that?"

My parents had no idea what it was. It became very, very cold and it was 98 degrees outside. I started having an asthma attack and the same angry voice came. "GET HIM OUT YOU LITTLE SH\*T. OR I WILL GET YOU. I COMMAND YOU!" I froze still and held my mom.

Over the next few weeks, everyone was getting sick. My sister and I went to the hospital for asthma. My mom went to the hospital I think because of her diabetes. And my dad broke his arm. My Lola was affected by dizzy spells and seemed to lose her breath a lot.

My parents despite being Catholic, were very superstitious people. They talked about the strange occurances they had themselves such as missing objects, the ugly tree, and the anger they felt for no reason. A Filipino healer or whatever he was was brought in through a friend of a friend. All of them religious but also superstitious. He camed to be a psychic and a healer. His name was Noly.

Noly said, "In this house is an evil force. There was a Black family who lived here who was also Christian. The family had many children and they all fought. Some of the children had died in an accident and one of them, the eldest, was a gay young man. His parents did not approve of him and threatened to kick him out. And then he grabbed the gun from his mom's purse and shot himself." Noly then went on to say, "the son tells me to bless this house or get out of it. There is an evil here that is looking to torment the people here."

Noly gave my parents a ritual to do where they put symbols of Jesus and the Virgin Mary all throughout the house. It was the Filipino Jesus and the Virgin Mary of course, not that it really mattered I guess. Food was placed around an altar for the "children here who died including the eldest son, to be given love that they needed. And for the parents to have the food that they had trouble bringing," as Noly said.

The strange occurrences stopped and I stopped feeling the presence of the "Spirit of the Apartment."

The ugly tree across the parking lot seemed to slowly die until it rotted, and the realtor company (probably) had it cut down.

Our family eventually moved out of the apartment and into our first house.

Once again, this story is told from the best of my recollection. I had also filled in gaps in my memory, some of them at least, such as the reason for my parent's fighting.

But as I said before, what I felt telling this story is still 100% the same. I am not religious and I have deep objections to organized religion.

But I hope and even pray that whoever is staying in that godforsaken apartment, is living in peace.
