My name is Joe Clarkson. 

When I was a small child, I was gifted. Great at a lot of things, and adequate at most. That all changed when I moved to Oakfield. Not too far away, but somehow not in the same state. 

Oakfield was a small town, somewhere near the Canada-US border, yet my parents never told me which state it was in. They couldn’t. Dad got a really good job offer. 

I started third grade there, I was eight, and would turn nine later in the year. On my first day of school, there was nothing really academic, thankfully, so I had no chance to show off my proficiency.  

However, the walk there was interesting, with the edifice that was the mental hospital. Edifice for the town at least, it was only a couple stories tall. It stood in the distance, and you could see it from the school yard, and the street there. Always looming. 

I was bored between the three recesses, each being a little breath of fresh air on the otherwise stagnant school day. That was, until the last one. 

It was the afternoon, and I hadn’t really made any friends yet. I was just sitting by myself under a tree, when I saw a rough looking man, standing behind the chain-link fence I was seated next to. 

The fear of strangers had been forced adamantly into my mind by then, and I whimpered, backing away. 

“I won’t hurt you,” he said. That’s what someone who wanted to murder you would say. 

But, considering the fence, I deemed I was relatively safe from this haggard man, and so, I approached. He was coughing. 

“I don’t have much time. Take this paper,” he said as he passed a sticky note to me. “Follow what this says. Take it seriously, and you will be fine.” 

I heard Ms. Smith calling out to me and approaching and turned away for a second before looking back. The man was gone, the coughing silenced.  

Knowing if the teacher had seen the man that she would with no doubt take the note from me, I stuffed it in my pocket, then waited for her to approach. 

“Joseph, what are you doing over here? Who were you talking to?” she snipped. 

Quick thinking saved me here. “Imaginary friend.” 

“Well, you should know better than to do stuff like that. We don’t do strange things like that here.” She paused. “You’ve learned your lesson, but I will talk to your parents about this. 

She left, and soon recess was over. That day as I walked home from school, I looked for the man, but he was gone. 

As said, my parents had a word with me about imaginary friends, and how I was too grown up and that they would have to send me to the ‘psychiatrist’ for it. 

I of course paid them no heed. 



Later that night, I opened the note. It had barely legible scrawl, unlike Mrs. Smith who had perfect handwriting, which I was sorely jealous of. This is what it contained:

*If you are reading this, I may be able to save you. I need you to follow these guidelines:* 

1. *Hide your identity* 
2. *Socialize only when necessary* 
3. *Be unexceptional* 
4. *If someone is following you, find a crowded place to be* 

*They will forget about you.* 

*I have proof, so that you will believe me. Look at your classmates. Think about their defining features, whether physical, social, etc. They will change. For now, you have to trust me.* 

*Once you have memorized this, destroy it.* 

The fourth rule seemed common enough, and the others seemed not too hard to follow. It was weird, but considering I had nothing to do at school, I decided to play along, holding in my laughter as I presumably tricked everyone. I would not laugh soon enough. 

 

Xavier was a new kid. He moved in around the second week of school, when I was beginning to get bored of the ruse. He was bright and funny, yet Ms. Smith never laughed at his jokes. She got tired of him quickly, unlike me. 

I was friends with him, we would play on the playground, mostly tag, but I made sure to never outrun him, nor anyone else. One day, we were playing tag, and I was chasing him. It had lasted longer than normal, and I was beginning to get very tired of the charade, so I decided to try and win this time. 

We ran for so long, he eventually ran into the school, and I chased him, laughing, panting as he sprinted through the halls. The teachers were very mad at us and shouted at us often. But none chased. 

However, after around fifteen minutes, we had slowed down significantly, and he stole away around a corner. When I turned the corner, Xavier was gone. 

I didn’t see him for the rest of the day. 

The next day, I went to school, ready to interrogate him about where he had gone. And, sure enough he was there. But when I asked him, he said he had gotten bored, and left it at that. It explained nothing, and I was grumpy about it for the rest of the day. 

 

Xavier made jokes after that. But they were different, not funny. But Ms. Smith sure seemed to think so. She always chuckled at them, as did many of the other kids, and I chuckled along to follow suit. Xavier said to call him by his middle name, Steven. I didn’t talk to him much after that. The ‘psychiatrists’ had probably made him normal. 

I dug through my backpack and eventually found the note from the man. It had been a few weeks now, and I hadn’t destroyed it. 

*I have proof, so that you will believe me. Look at your classmates. Think about their defining features, whether physical, social, etc. They will change.*

Sure enough, it had happened.  

I heard a knock at my door. My mom spoke in an indifferent voice. 

“What are you doing in there, sweetie? Hopefully not talking to your imaginary friend again,” she said, giving a faint chuckle. 

“One second mom!” I shouted, as I read through it a few last times, before shredding it, then scattering the pieces. 

She opened the door. Her eyes grew frustrated for a single moment. 

In an instant, I smiled slightly, rising, I coughed, partially because of my recent cold, partially to cover any anxiousness in my voice. 

“Is it time for bed yet?” I asked. 

“Yes.” 

I went to sleep. 

 

The man appeared in the newspapers. He had been taken to the mental hospital, locked away forever. I never disregarded what he had said, however. 

I heard my mom talking to my teacher.  

“Something’s wrong with him, he’s been acting weird. Watch over him, okay?” my mom said. “I’m worried.” 

The only thing she should be worried about is my stupid cough that won’t go away. 

 

I blended in throughout the years, getting a mix of B’s and C’s, as well as an occasional A. I didn’t raise my hand in class often, limiting myself to once a week. I chatted with a few other friends, though spending time with them left me unsettled. 

On my sixteenth birthday, I ran away. I had just got a new car, drab and grey, courtesy of my father. I told them I was going to take a drive around the park. They believed me. 

As I took it out, slow and steady, I noticed something. Ms. Smith. She was in her own car, tailing mine. I didn’t acknowledge her. The school hadn’t given her my address, yet she had been waiting for me.  

I drove around the park a few times, then checked my mirror, making sure to not move my head. Ms. Smith was gone. I changed my route. 

Moving through the town, I could tell something was off about the buildings. The same buildings everywhere, the same few colors of cars, no one outside, everyone inside at once. They were all gathered around a dinner table. Every single house.  

I increased my speed, and my car started to screech, so I quickly slammed on the brakes. 

I drove for a while, barely staying awake. After a few hours, I was back in town. Not in the distant byways. 

 Ms. Smith was behind me again. 

In a moment of panic, I turned my head back, checking to make sure. Ms. Smith grinned. I waved at her, then continued back to my house. To this day, I’m not sure why I turned back. I wish I hadn’t. 

As I approached my house, I remembered the fourth rule, and realized home would not be safe. I slammed the gas and veered in the direction of the high school. There was a football game going on, and there were lots of people there. 

Ms. Smith had apparently been lost in the confusion and was not following me as I approached the field. I snuck in, then sat on one of the bleachers. Everything was normal, except for the highschoolers not being as rowdy as I had expected. I had seen things on television back at my old home, yet there were none of the old television programs here. 

There were also no telephone wires. No outside communications. I realized this as I sat up there, next to one of my distant friends, Cody. 

“Why are there no phones?” I whispered out loud.  

Cody turned to me. “Of course there are.” 

He turned back to the game.  

“John’s doing so good today, would you look at that!” Cody said. 

I heard my name being shouted. My parents had found where I had been, and were mad, they climbed up the bleachers, and I saw no use hiding from them. 

“Cody, what have you been doing to our little boy?” Mom growled. She turned to me, “He’s a bad influence, sneaking off like this. Someone else will take care of that, come with me.” On the supervised drive back to my house, I noticed telephone poles lining the streets. 

 

“What are you doing?” Mom asked. 

“I’m calling Susie, from my old school. Just want to keep in touch,” I responded dully. 

“She probably moved. That’s not her number anymore.” 

“Their house was passed down through generations. Not likely,” I accused. 

Three days later my mother came up to me. She turned on the news, then ushered me over. 

“Breaking News: Local teen found dead, hit by car! Identity confirmed to be Susie Coleman, of local high school...” 

I blocked out the rest of the speech. There was a picture of her corpse, and it was her, blood trailing from various wounds. 

“That’s horrible!” I exclaimed. “Now I see why my call didn’t go through.” 

The thing was, there was no news channel that broadcast things outside of the town. I barred my windows and door that night, then slept in my clothes hamper. I held my coughs in. When I woke up the next morning, things in my room were moved. My worst fears had been confirmed. 

 

For the second time in a week, I tried to escape. Dawn would not strike for a few hours, and I knew no one could see me. The town was on lockdown, hunting for a ‘missing person’. I stole my mom’s car, not daring to use my own. 

From the minute I pulled out of the driveway, I knew I was being followed. A car trailed behind me; the windshield tinted enough that I couldn't see the driver, but I knew it was Ms. Smith. 

I floored the gas, uncaring, driving as fast as I could to the nearby forest. I jumped out of the car, placing my mom’s purse on the gas pedal to keep it running. It would hit ahead and throw them off my trail. 

I entered the forest. 

Stumbling through the trees at night was not a pleasant experience. I cut myself on branches and twisted my ankles trying to get out. 

I made my way to a clearing. There was something moving there, a body. It was moaning and screeching, drenched in blood. Susie. She stopped when I drew near, then stared at me, eyes devoid of pain. Devoid of expression. 

I ran out back into the forest and heard a limping figure behind me. Adrenaline pushing me as hard as it could, I slowly heard the limp grow stronger and stronger, becoming a full run. 

Curving around a ditch, I tripped, falling into the hole, then heard the footsteps draw nearer. I saw the ditch led to a drainage pipe. I hid in there, making little noise, and waited until she left. Screams of anger echoed through the night. 

After catching my breath, I peeked out, coughing. Nothing but the cool night air. Slowly, I made my way out. In the distance, I could see a light. 

 

It took only a few more minutes to make it to the source. It was a gas station, and the man in there greeted me with something I had not seen in years. A warm welcome. 

After getting some food and water – for free since I didn’t have my wallet on me – the man began to question me about my appearance. 

“That’s a crazy story coming from Oakfield. Nothing ever happens there. I suppose they want to not be noticed, from your story. By the way, son, what is your name?” 

1. *Hide your identity* 

“You don’t need to know that” I said, still tense. 

“Come on, it’s not that big of a deal.” 

“No.” 

“Son, I just want to check your records, make sure you’re not a nutcase,” he sighed. “Afterall, you don’t want to have to go to the psychiatrists, do you?” 

I backed away, and the man began to grow agitated, shouting for me to come back and tell him my name. I ran out and started down the road. There were no cars. 

 

A day or so later I reached a town. A normal one, with normal people. No one following me. No one trying to take me away. It was hard to get back on my feet of course, going to high school in the day, then working at night to make ends meet. 

I never told anyone else about the town. No one. That is until now. You see, last night I found something. A trail of blood leading to a field. 

“Joe, come back...” it said. “You can’t leave Oakfield. It can’t get out.” 

They still follow me. They do not want people to know about this, because they do not want people to know about Oakfield, and whatever goes on behind the doors of the mental hospital. I intend to go where they cannot find me. 

No one will take me seriously. After all, nothing ever happens in Oakfield. And to them, I am insane.
