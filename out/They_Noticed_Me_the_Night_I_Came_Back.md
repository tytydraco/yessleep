My father wasn’t much of a role model.  
 He drank too much, spoke too loudly, and somehow always made a room feel smaller. I moved out when I was seventeen and never looked back.  
 It had been years since I’d seen him—or this town.

The police called three weeks ago and told me he’d been declared dead. Drunk driving accident. Single vehicle. Closed case.  
 I didn’t ask questions. I just packed my car and drove back.

As I pulled onto the front lawn, a strange wave of nostalgia hit me. Not warmth. Not comfort. Just memories I thought I’d buried.  
 I loved him.  
 I don’t think he ever loved me back.

The breeze carried the smell of cut grass, a lawnmower droning somewhere nearby. Everything looked exactly the same. That somehow made it worse.

I was halfway to the front door when someone shouted behind me.

“Hey—ain’t that young Bryan?”

I turned. Greg stood in his driveway, older, heavier, but unmistakably the same.

“Yeah,” I said. “It’s been a while.”

He squinted at me. “Didn’t think you’d ever come back.”

“Didn’t think I would either.”

His smile faded. “Sorry about your dad.”

I stared at him longer than I meant to.  
 “Thanks,” I said.

Greg nodded awkwardly and walked back inside.

I stood there a moment longer, keys in my hand, staring at the front door—wondering why it felt like I was being watched.

Inside, beer cans littered the floor. Dishes sat untouched in the sink. Dust coated the dining table.  
 I stared at the stairs leading to my old bedroom, dreading the idea of going up. Instead, I began cleaning—clearing my mind.

Hours passed. The sun fell.

I finally crept up the stairs and decided to check my father’s room. The aroma of cigarettes filled the air. His bed was neatly made.  
 On top of it lay a white jumpsuit and a single red clown nose.

The outfit felt wrong—like it was waiting for me to put it on.

That feeling of being watched washed over me again.

I moved to the window to look out onto the street.  
 The hair on the back of my neck stood up.

A man stood in the moonlight wearing a clown costume, staring directly at me. A white suit with red stripes. Powdery makeup drenched his face.

I tilted my head, convinced I was hallucinating.

The man lifted both hands to his cheeks and dragged the red lipstick upward, forcing a smile.

My thoughts spiraled.

Buzz. Buzz.

My phone rang.  
 A random number.

I didn’t take my eyes off the clown as I answered. “Hello?”

A familiar voice huffed, “Get away from the window and lock your doors. You’ll be safe.”

“Greg?” I snapped. “What kind of fucked-up joke is this?”

“Bryan,” he said urgently, “please trust me. Do not look at them. Don’t give them a reason to introduce themselves. Just stay in the house and hide.”

I scoffed. “Alright, Greg. Goodnight.”

As I hung up, the clown raised his arm and waved at me—slow and mechanical.

Disgust churned in my stomach.

I rushed downstairs, preparing to confront him. But as I neared the front door, I heard the heavy stomp of oversized red boots approaching. Then laughter—muffled, multiple voices.

I peeked through the side window.

My heart sank.

Three clowns stood on my front porch.  
 In unison, they pulled switchblades from behind their backs.

I gasped, stumbling into a lamp. It crashed to the floor.  
 The laughter outside intensified.

I ran upstairs, dialing 911.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“There are three men dressed as clowns on my property,” I said, breathless. “They’re holding knives.”

Silence.

“Hello?” I screamed.

The operator chuckled. “What are you clowning around about?”

I stared at my phone. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

The laughter poured through the speaker—high-pitched and endless.

I hung up, killed the lights, grabbed my old baseball bat, and locked myself in my bedroom.

I watched from the window.

After ten minutes, the clowns finally left.  
 They skipped down the street, prancing into the darkness—knives dangling at their sides.

I sat in my childhood bedroom clutching the bat until the morning light bled through the blinds. Even then, I didn’t move. I waited—listening—for laughter that never came.

At sunrise, I crossed the street to Greg’s house.

I knocked once.  
 Then again.  
 Harder.

Greg opened the door just enough to see my face. When he recognized me, his expression darkened.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he muttered, stepping aside.

The curtains were drawn inside. Every lock on the door was bolted.

“What were those things?” I demanded. “Who are they?”

Greg didn’t answer right away. He poured himself a drink—shaking badly enough that it spilled over the rim.

“I noticed them a few years back,” he said quietly. “Started with one. Then two. Now…” He trailed off.

“What do they want?”

Greg finally looked at me. His eyes were bloodshot.

“They want to be seen,” he said. “That’s the problem.”

I crossed my arms. “You told me not to look at them.”

“You don’t stare,” he snapped. “You don’t wave. You don’t acknowledge them. And you sure as hell don’t call the cops.”

“People have been dying,” I said.

Greg nodded slowly.

“Disappearances. Accidents. Folks just… gone.” He swallowed. “Something took root in this town a long time ago. And when someone notices it—really notices it—that’s when things start happening.”

Greg leaned closer, lowering his voice.

“And Bryan?”  
 “They already know you’re back.”

I didn’t respond. I turned and walked toward the door.

“Wait,” Greg said. “Do what you want with this, but—your father stopped drinking a couple years ago.”

I froze.

I didn’t say goodbye.

I crossed the street in silence, tears blurring my vision. None of it made sense—the clowns, my father’s death, the lie I’d been told.

The house was quiet when I stepped inside. Too quiet.

I went straight to my father’s room, desperate to rationalize everything. The white jumpsuit lay where I’d left it. The red nose sat on the bed, staring back at me.

I snapped.

I threw the suit across the room. I overturned the nightstand. Glass shattered. Wood cracked. Years of anger and confusion spilled out of me.

Then I saw it.

A Polaroid lay on the floor.

My father stood in the photo—smiling, dressed as a clown. Ten others surrounded him, identical makeup, identical suits.

Shock tore through me.

I know I should leave this town.  
 Nothing good is waiting here.

But I’m not leaving.  
 I want answers.

It’s nightfall again. I’m watching through the windows.  
The clowns are back outside—and this time, I don’t think I’m supposed to hide.
