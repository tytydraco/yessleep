Dear Diary, 



I found the texts. I found fucking evidence of him cheating on her with a brunette chick named Hannah. He talked about how he couldn't wait to see her. How he couldn't wait to hear her moan his name. How he couldn't wait to fuck her dry. I couldn't stop gagging as I read through the texts. How could he do this to her? To our family? I will let you know more as I do my research. 

Please keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

Dear Diary,


I found that bitch's instagram account. How could he like someone so fucking ugly? He needs to stop this. They need to stop this. Momma would be so heartbroken. She'd weep herself unconscious. Oh no no momma would be so hurt. I cannot bear to see her tear stricken face once again. I'd die. I need to find out more and put an end to this affair. Please keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

Dear Diary,


Is he insane? IS HE FUCKING SICK IN THE HEAD?! He brought her to our house. When I saw a new car in the driveway I knew it was her. I knew it in my gut but I couldn't bring myself to believe it. I was making excuses for him. Like oh it might be one of his colleagues or a friend of momma's and I want to hit myself for making excuses for him. Momma would be so disappointed if she knew.

          How could he bring her to the house?! How did he think he'd get away when momma and Teo were right there?! I couldn't stop shaking with anger. By the time I entered the house I was breathing hard. He came rushing to my side when he saw me and shook me hard. He was going on and on about how worried he was for me. And that slut came to stand by his side too. Acting all nice 


"Oh sweetie, are you okay?"

"Oh sweetie, have you eaten today? Do you want me to make something for you?"


I wanted to slit her fucking mouth open. And then the worst part came. He introduced me to her. And all I wanted to do was scream into their faces. I wanted to scream at them for doing this to momma but I couldn't. I held back to save his pride. Surely she didn't know he had a wife. If she found out she'd insult him. Yes. I'm right. I should confront him first. I should knock some sense into him. I'll confront him after school tomorrow. Please keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

Dear Diary, 


I confronted him. I screamed at him. I couldn't take it anymore. He wouldn't stop talking about that whore. HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN LOVE. What if momma had heard all of his nonsense? I screamed at him for ruining our family once again. I asked him why he would do this to us AGAIN. had he not learned his lesson the first time around?! I screamed until my lungs hurt. And he said nothing. He just stared at me pale faced and wide eyed. I hope he has learned his lesson now. If not, I'll take it in my own hands. 

Keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

Dear Diary,


I thought everything was back to normal again. I thought he'd realised his mistake when I didn't see Homewrecker yesterday. That's what they call sluts who ruin others' family because they can't keep it in their pants. But I was wrong. I was so fucking wrong. Tonight I'll dm that bitch and tell her everything. I don't care about his pride anymore. Nothing is more important to me than momma and Teo.


                                 I did it. I dmed her. She said that she knew. She said that it was okay and that she was here for me. I saw red. I called her a fucking whore and told her she was nothing but a new hole to fuck and that he'd tire of her soon enough like he'd tired of the bitch from 5 years ago. I told her to find another home to wreck. AND SHE BLOCKED ME and 5 minutes later daddy pounded on my room. He slapped me across the face 5 times and told me to stop acting like my mother and to start acting my age. My face was swollen by the time I cleaned up all the blood. I can never not be like my momma. I'm her and she's me with green eyes, honey skin and long thick black hair. And the madness in our eyes. Madness that could tame the greatest of storms and madness that could weaken the firmest of grounds. Momma cannot handle another heartbreak and Teo is too young to know. It's all in my hands now. I need to do what needs to be done.

 Keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

Dear Diary,


I followed him. I followed him to her house. I know where she lives. I watched through the window as he kissed her long and hard. I wanted to light his lips on fire. I watched them fuck. Eyes wide. This gave me a sense of deja vú. I thought back to how me and momma were in the same position as me but 5 years ago, in front of a different house, watching him fuck a different slut. I remember how momma was trembling with rage and hatred, eyes wider than humanly possible, saliva mixed with blood dripping down the corners of her mouth as she bit into her lower lip all while grinning like a clown. Her grip around my wrist tightening by the second, tears streaming down my face. But momma wouldn't have to live through her worst day again because I would. I will live through the worst day of my life so she doesn't have to. I will make sure that there aren't any more bad days. I will put an end to this so she can live her life happily.

 Keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

Dear Diary, 


I went to her house again today. I didn't follow him. I went alone. While I was here the other day I noticed that she had an outside access basement. I broke its flimsy, old lock. I made sure not to make it seem obvious. If you want to fuck other women's husbands maybe get stronger locks. I'll bring my recorder to document it all and then copy it down in my diary (OMG !! I'M SO EXCITED)

 


I NEED TO END THIS. I NEED TO STOP THIS. 


I HAVE TO. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY. MOMMA WILL BE SO PROUD WHEN SHE HEARS OF THIS. SHE'LL HUG ME TIGHT AND WHISPER HER GRATITUDE OVER AND OVER.


YES.

I.

HAVE.

TO.

DO.

THIS.

FOR MOMMA AND TEO.

FROM ME.




keep this safe. I love you, my diary.

    Morning



Dear Diary,



I'll kill her. I'll kill him. I'll kill them. I'll kill her. I'll kill him. I'll kill them. I'll kill her. I'll kill him. I'll kill them. I'll kill her. I'll kill him. I'll kill them. 


I WILL KILL THAT SLUT. I WILL KILL THAT FUCKER. I WILL AVENGE MOMMA. 




 24/3/2XXX



Dear Diary,



I'm here. I'm standing outside her door. I make sure to jam and block the front and the back door and all the windows from the outside so they cannot escape. They're in there. I can hear them even out here. Disgusting fucks. Let's do a last minute check.


Dark clothes. Check.


Face mask. Check ( this is just to get me in the feels you know, they'll recognize me eventually)


Blueprint of the house I got from a real estate website. Check.

 

Acid resistance gloves (in purple !) Check.


2 gallons of high concentration acid. Check.


Can of gasoline. Check.


Huge box of matches. Check.


Acid proof stainless- steel tub (with a capacity of 2 gallons. Wide mouthed)


.22 pistol I got from craigslist with a silencer (I never realised how easy it was to buy guns) Check.


5 piece butcher knife set along with a thumb knife (in purple !) Check. 


Saw blade and axe (just in case) Check.


Sharpened screwdriver and pliers. Check.


A pair of scissors. Check.


Industrial pack of zip ties. Check.


Industrial size torch. Check.


Industrial size medical gauze. Check.


Huge duffel bag to carry all of this. Check. 


Sound proof black shoes. Check


Small camera strapped to my chest to film everything. Check


Let the game begin !



I enter the basement trying to remain as calm as I can. I brought the duffel bag with me (it's heavy !!) I set the duffel bag on the ground and clear the area a little. I find a table and set it right in the middle. ( I do all of this while wearing gloves of course, I'm not stupid !). I pry off the inner basement lock with my pliers and slowly enter the kitchen. 


I have the blueprint memorised but still do a double check. I enter the hallway that leads to the bedroom. Their voices grow louder and louder. I draw my pistol and slowly enter the room. They're both naked. Him over her. She notices me first and screams. God even her screams sound disgusting. I point my gun at them. He scrambles off her, hands raised. She desperately tries to cover herself but I shake my head. She stops. At least she can take hints. I signal at them to move towards the kitchen. They do with their hands raised. She bolts to the front door. But realizes that it's locked. (see daddy she tried to run away. She'd sacrifice YOU to keep HERSELF safe. Momma would burn the whole world for you. But you didn't see that. Are you regretting your decisions now? But it's too late.)


       She lets out a whimper. I point the gun towards her. She obeys and follows him to the basement. I close the basement door behind me. I walk to my duffel bag and turn on the torch. The dark room lights up in white light. They squint their eyes. I motion for them to sit on the broken chairs. I slide the pack of zip ties towards them. I motion for her to tie his hands and feet. She does as told, mascara running down her face. I stride to the duffel bag, gun still pointed towards her and set it on the table. I pull out all my equipment and lay it on the table. A cry leaves my father's mouth as he eyes the table. Hannah is shaking, hiccups st uck in her throat. I motion her towards the screwdriver. She lifts it with quivering hands. 


'Stab his eyes, lightly, not too hard or I'll blow up your fucking tits.' 


She nods,walking towards him. He tries to put distance between them but I point my gun at him. He stops. Closes his eyes and waits for the pain. She stabs him in the left eye first, he lets out a blood curdling scream. Then his right eye, he screams even louder. Blood drips down his face. The screwdriver, a mess of blood and tissue. I hand her the medical gauze. 


''Tie it over his eyes. We don't want him to bleed to death.''


She does as told. 



''Daddy, my beloved daddy. That was for looking at another woman."


'See daddy. She doesn't care. She'd hurt you to keep herself safe. Momma would stab her own eyes before she let anyone stab yours.'



''Baby, my darling child. Please don't do this. There's still time. Stop this madness. We'll get you help. Please, my child. Spare your daddy this once."



''How can I stop the madness when it lives in me daddy? There's no going back now daddy. Momma spared your life the first time around. She won't do it again. I won't LET HER do it again.''



''DEAR CHILD! YOUR MOTHER IS DEAD ! YOUR MOTHER KILLED HERSELF AND YOUR BROTHER ! SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU TOO ! BUT I SAVED YOU. DON'T DO THIS.''



''This is not the time to joke around daddy. Read the room. Momma and Teo are not dead. I talk to them every day. They sleep by me every night. Now, now, enough fatherly love. Where were we?"



''NO BABY PLEASE ! THINK ! THIS ISN'T YOU, YOU HEAR ME?!''



I hand her the thumb knife. Gun still pointed. 



''Now lovely Hannah. Carve his lips out with precision, please!''


I say. Wide eyed.


She struggles to put on the thumb knife.


''Come on. We haven't got all night.''


She starts carving his lips. Moving her thumb along his upper lip, making sure not to cut any skin. He trashes against the chair. Screaming louder and louder by the second. Blood oozes out of his face. Sliding down her hands. His lips come off slowly, hanging in the air and dripping red. Then they fall off his face. 


I giggle out loud. 


"Oh daddy, you look so funny without lips and don't try to speak, I won't understand you anyway.''

 


''Oh and I almost forgot. And that was for kissing another woman !''


I then hand her the pliers. 


''Pull out his teeth. One by one and then wrap the gauge over his mouth."



She starts pulling out his teeth. His screams, a melody in my ear. His face, a swollen mess by the time she's done. His bloody teeth clatter to the floor one by one. Their sound is enough to make my head spin and for butterflies to take residence in my stomach.


She then wraps the gauge over his mouth. 



I then hand her the scissors 



''This is getting boring. Make it fast. Cut off his fucking dick and balls. If you have any trouble with the scissors, I'll hand you a knife.''

  


She shakes her head at first but then obeys. He screams but his screams sound like that of a pig. 


She kneels down and starts cutting. His wails sound gurgly with a mouth full of blood. 


"And that daddy is for fucking another woman.''


His penis falls first, landing with a soft sound into the pool of blood. Blood oozes out of the wound. Then his balls. Blood falls to the ground like a waterfall. She slips in the sticky fluid and lands face first in his blood and tissue splatters.




I laugh out loud. 



''Dear lord. Hannah, do you like dicks that belong to other women so much that you couldn't help yourself? be more careful. Do I have to tell you everytime, Hannah?! Wrap him with the gauze. God, how can you like someone so dumb daddy?''



She haphazardly wraps him up. 



''Now for the endgame! SLIT. HIS. THROAT. HARD AND NICE.''


I hand her the saw blade.


She doesn't hesitate and slits his throat. What looks like litres and litres of blood gushes out. I dump him off the chair. He falls face first in his own blood, flesh and teeth. 


''Hurrah! One man down.''


I raise my hand for a high five and she gives me one with trembling hands. She tries to smile through her tears and drops the saw blade.



''Now for our lovely Hannah!''


Her smile falters. She shakes her head. 


''No. Please no.'' She manages. 


Huh. As if I'd listen to her pleas. Never. I'd never betray momma like that. I'd rather die than do that.


I grab the acid. Pour it into the tub. I tie her hands with the zip tie. She tries to scratch at me with no avail. I grab her by the neck and dump her head in the acid. Her screams get muffled by the acid.The acid hisses on contact. Horrific screams, no human should hear. Her tight skin starts melting into the acid. Acid burns through her flesh. Her eyes, instantly damaged. Brunette hair falling off like clumps of snow. I then take the largest butcher knife and chop off her neck by stabbing it over and over. Her disgusting blood, spraying my face crimson. My skin burns when her blood falls on me. It burns with hatred nursed by the darkest pits of hell. 


Her bones make a crunch sound against the knife and her skin and flesh come apart under my wrath. Her now severed head sinks completely into the acid with nothing to support it. Her decapitated body gives in to gravity and falls to the ground. Blood everywhere. On her naked pale skin. On my clothes. Everywhere. The bright room, now painted red. 


I heave a sigh of relief and give myself a pat on the back. Job. Well. Done.



I move my belongings outside. I peel off my bloody clothes, wash up and wear one of Hannah's dresses. I douse the house in gasoline. Every single room. The outside and the inside. I strike half a dozen matches and light it on fire. I see the house go up in flames. Flames that rival the madness and fury living in me. And then, I run.



I laugh. I cry. I punch myself. But at last it was over. Then I come 



 25/3/2XXX 

    3 am.


Dear Diary, 


       After it was all over I laid next to momma and Teo. I hugged momma tight. Momma and Teo were cold and boney and they smelled too. They didn't feel like they did 5 years ago anymore. Now that I think about it, it was on that day that they changed. The day after we saw daddy fucking another woman. The day she took me and Teo on a car ride when I was 14 and he was 10. They haven't talked to me since. Teo hasn't grown either. I cup their boney skulls and kiss them on the head. My lips shiver. Do they hate me? But…but I did all of this FOR THEM. FOR US. I scream at them but they still didn't look at me nor do they move. I throw Teo across the room. His head hits the walls and he falls down without so much as a whimper. I saved them. I brought them back from the cold ground where daddy had left them to rot. I SAVED THEM AND THIS IS WHAT I GET?!



NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 



I will light them on fire just like I did to daddy and Hannah. I will kill them. And so I take the leftover gasoline and matches and light them on fire. I light our house on fire.  I stand outside and watch it all burn. My childhood and my life and my love. But I'm nothing without them. So I will go with them. I will burn with them. I will not let them leave me all alone. I will torture them on their way to the after life. Wish me luck. 

Keep this safe. I love you, my diary forever and always.
