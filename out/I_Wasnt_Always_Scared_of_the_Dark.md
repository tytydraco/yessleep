One of the biggest traditions I can recall from my childhood was my family’s annual camping trip to Yosemite.  It was never just my parents and I, but rather the entire extended side of my dad’s family.  Ranging from 20 to 25 depending on the number of people available that year, we’d start coordinating camp sites, arrival times, and who was bringing what months in advance.  In the days leading up to our departure, the group chat my aunt had insisted on creating for the family would run my phone’s notifications ragged.  Though I was never one to silence it.  In fact, the incessant chatter only served to heighten my excitement.

Ever since I can remember, I’ve always loved the great outdoors.  As a child, I would frequently set up a tent in the backyard.  I’d often lose myself in fantasy, imagining I was off on some rugged adventure deep in the untamed woodlands of ages long past.  As soon as I was able, I signed up for my local scouting troop, making it all the way to first-class rank before schoolwork forced me to quit.  In a perfect world, I would have stuck with it, but sometimes life has other plans, at least that’s the mantra my mother instilled in me. 

Nevertheless, my love of the adventure offered by the wilderness never waned.  I knew that each year, I’d find myself packed into my family’s car, rumbling down the dirt roads that led to the heart of Yosemite national forest. The smell of roasting marshmallows, the chill of the river, the fragrance of sugar pines, and the vastness of the twinkling night sky, unrestricted by the light pollution.  For all intents and purposes, Yosemite was heaven on earth to me.

At least, that’s how I’d like to remember it.  Now, as an adult, I’ve come to prefer the constant illumination provided by Los Angeles.  I no longer feel a sense of wonder when I gaze upon the mountains and hills lining the horizon.  Instead, I feel trapped.  I feel watched.  I sleep with my bathroom light on, and I keep military grade flashlights stashed in my nightstand and car.  The sunset used to paint a beautiful mosaic of colors across the sky, but now, it feels more like a warning.  Like I’m watching a timer slowly tick down to zero.

In 2016, my family arrived in Yosemite for that year’s trip.  I was around 17 at this point and now fell into the category of “Older Cousin”.  This meant I was now expected to be somewhat in charge of/responsible for the younger family members, or at the very least set a good example.  I wasn’t a huge fan of kids, a trait which hasn’t drastically changed over time, but I was willing to make sure my hyperactive little cousins stayed safe.  I didn’t want to see them hurt by tripping over a root or slipping off a rock at the river.  I don’t hate kids; I just don’t really find it easy to relate or engage with them.  That doesn’t mean I’m apathetic towards them.

I feel like most decent people would at least feel a twinge of sadness if they saw a missing child poster or received an amber alert warning of an abduction.  It seems like human nature to me.  That pack mentality that nests in the back of our lizard brain, compelling us to protect our young and those we hold dear.  It’s just in our nature as humans.

Another thing that has cemented itself in humanity’s collective consciousness is an instinctual fear of the dark, or if you want to go deeper, a fear of what could be *in* the dark.  Humans are arguably at the top of the food chain because, for the most part, we have developed ways to banish this fear.  From huddling around the warmth of the fire, to the neon illumination of city skylines, we’ve come a long way. We’ve done a lot to push the darkness back.

The only locations left where one can experience the ancient dark of our past are places like Yosemite.  You never realize just how dark the night is until you find yourself isolated from the light of urbanization.  I have very vivid memories of shutting my flashlight off, waving my hand in front of my face, and realizing that I am effectively blind, my sense of depth and space swallowed up by the dark.  In that moment, I received a brief taste of that deep, animalistic terror our ancestors experienced.  I was in the void, and I had no way of knowing if I was alone.

But of course, all I had to do was flick a switch, and my flashlight quickly dispelled that feeling of dread.  I was armed against the darkness, and surely, so long as that remained so, I would be safe.  I’d have nothing to fear.

I would say I wasn’t scared of the dark more than anyone else my age typically would be.  Did I love it?  No, of course not.  But it never stopped me from enjoying myself during these trips. Matter of fact, one of my favorite games to play with my cousins in Yosemite was flashlight tag.

I’m sure I don’t need to explain the rules to you.  One seeker, several hiders, everyone gets a flashlight, and if the seeker manages to shine their light on you and call your name, you are found.  As I aged the game lost its appeal, but my younger cousins still loved to play.

Now, we weren’t stupid.  We knew that it was important to stay safe during this game, especially since we were playing in the forest at night.  We’d never wander far from camp, and everyone was given a buddy.  These were the rules that I found my mother repeating to myself, my older cousin Sarah, and our younger cousins just before the game begun that year.

I was exhausted and felt like doing anything other than playing a game I felt was a little too childish for my mature 17-year-old self.  More than anything, I wanted to sleep.  But tradition was tradition, and it wouldn’t be a family trip to Yosemite without the ceremonial game. 

Among the swarm of children was my little cousin Sam.  He was about 9 years old at the time, and to say he feared the dark would be a massive understatement.  He was a quiet kid, less inclined to the shenanigans and antics of the more hyperactive cousins.  They never picked on him though, he was just shy and more comfortable with the comics and action figures he’d bring to Yosemite every year.  That night, I could tell he was on edge.  His posture told me that he was afraid, and he seemed unable to stop stealing glances at the dark gaps between the trees.  When it came time to pair off with our buddies, he instantly assigned himself to me.

I’d always indulged him and his interests.  We shared a lot in common.  He loved to show me the latest characters he’d sketched or talk my ear off about whatever comic series he was currently obsessing over.  Though I was never as introverted at his age, I knew what feeling like an outsider was like.  I wanted to make sure he always felt welcome and comfortable with himself.  I knew that he compared himself to his more extroverted cousins, so I did my best to remind him that the only person he ever needed to be was himself.

So, for that night, he was my responsibility, and I was more than happy to help him enjoy a game that I’d loved so much as a child. 

My younger cousins, Daniel and his brother Mike, were selected as the seekers for the first round.  With a 20-second head start, Sam, myself, and the rest of the hiders fled into the trees.  The game had officially begun. 

Sam followed close behind me as we ducked and weaved between branches, our flashlights kept dim and low.  For a moment, the feeling of excitement and joy I’d experienced during my younger years in Yosemite returned.  The chilly air breezing against my face, the scrape of dirt beneath my feet, the taste of s’mores still fresh on my tongue, each sensation was like a portal to the past.  I quickly found myself filled with the determination to win, both for my own satisfaction, and for what I viewed as the benefit of Sam.  If I could help him win the game, and by extension win against his obvious fear of the dark, I knew I’d be playing my part as a model older cousin.  More importantly, I wanted him to see that he was stronger than his fears and anxieties.

Eventually, we came across a cluster of trees that offered the perfect hiding spot.  Switching off our lights and crouching down amongst the twisting trunks and branches, we settled in for the game to begin in earnest.

Straining my ears against the soft rustling of pine needles and the distant chatter of other camp sites, I listened and watched for the tell-tale signs of Daniel and Mike.  A cry of surprise here, the erratic beam of a flashlight there, it typically wasn’t hard as a hider to know when to silently slip away to a better hiding spot.  But for a decent amount of time, the twilight blanket that had draped itself over the woods remained undisturbed.

As I focused my eyes and ears against the silence and gloom of the forest, I felt Sam gently tug on my jacket sleeve.  In a hushed voice barely above a whisper, he asked me how we would know we were the last ones left.  I told him that once we heard the seeker shout “Olly Olly Oxen free!”, that was when we’d know that only one group of hiders remained.  He asked me why that phrase, and I told him I honestly had no idea.  I knew it came from somewhere, and I was sure someone had told me the root of it once, but I couldn’t remember.  Sam seemed to find the phrase funny. Seizing the opportunity, I decided to further lighten his mood by letting him know that Daniel, despite his tough guy persona, was very scared of the dark, therefore I liked our odds of winning.

This was a complete lie, but I figured it would help ease the anxiety I could sense radiating off Sam as he picked at his hang nails and stared unblinking into the darkness.  Did I think we’d win?  Maybe.  But I knew Daniel and Mike were competitive types who took the duty of hunting down hiders very, very seriously.

For several more minutes, the occasional flash of light and shout of surprise cut through the silence.  If my count was correct, Sam and I were among the last players left.  I’d thought we could actually win.  Even Sam seemed more relaxed, and I could sense a new air of determination about him.  I smiled, feeling proud of both myself and of him.

I was then yanked back to the present when I heard footsteps off to our right.  As best I could tell, it seemed like two pairs of feet, slow and deliberate, like Daniel and Mark were doing their best to stay undetected.  I silently motioned for Sam to stay low, stay quiet, keep his flashlight off, and be ready to run. 

As we hunkered down, I strained my ears, trying to pinpoint how close the brothers were.  They hadn’t sounded too far off.  Not so close that I knew it was game over, but close enough to know that making a break for it would mean just that: Game Over. 

So, the strategy was simple.  Stay as silent and still as possible.  Any sounds or lights would have given us away completely.  I could feel Sam tensing as he held a death grip on my sleeve, and in the dark he resembled more of a statue than a 9-year-old kid.  I knew that his fears had crept back into his head.

The footsteps continued to stalk through the trees.  It was difficult to tell if they were getting closer or not. The wind continued to flow through the pines, filling the air with soft and rhythmic humming.  It was this part of the game that I’d always found the most exhilarating.  The buildup before the split-second decision to either stay hidden or sprint away had never not been thrilling.  But something was different that time.

My excitement was soon replaced with an older feeling, something more primitive.  Though small and faint, I felt every muscle in my body tense.  Suddenly I felt small, exposed, and watched.  My breath became slow and strained, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.  It occurred to me that the entire time I’d been listening to those footsteps, I had never seen a flashlight search through the trees.

Then, without warning, the footsteps rushed us.

Sam took off at a dead sprint, partially dragging me along with him.  That icy fear was now screaming terror, and my body made the decision to chase after Sam.  Faster than I could blink, however, Sam disappeared into the dark.  As I ran after him, frantically scanning the trees with my flashlight, I realized I’d completely lost sight of him.  Panicking, I stopped and shined my light behind me. Sam had vanished and I was just about to inform Daniel and Mike that the game was over, and they needed to help me find him.  But instead of the grinning faces of my two younger cousins, I was instead met with only the trees.  There was nobody there.

I searched and searched for Daniel and Mike, but no matter how loudly I called or where I shined my light, there was no sign of them.  All that surrounded me was the dark of the night and the looming figures of trees.  My mind immediately thought of the state that Sam must be in.  Lost, alone, and scared out of his mind.  I needed to find him.

I turned back the way I’d been following Sam.  Looking down, I was soon able to find his footprints.  Now I wasn’t anything close to a skilled tracker or hunter, but I figured if I followed their general direction and continued to call out for him, he’d eventually find his way back to me.  This was the exact opposite of how I’d wanted this game to go for Sam.

Shining my flashlight downward, a slowly began following the path Sam had left.  Twisting and turning through the trees, I soon found myself at the edge of a massive clearing.  This was where my family and I would go stargazing or catch glimpses of a small herd of deer.  I knew where I was, but I was also painfully aware of how far Sam must’ve run.  The light of the campfires were now just small flickers in the distance.  My flashlight was the sole source of illumination against the night.

Sam’s footprints ended just where the clearing met the treeline.  He must’ve ran into the meadow, and sure enough, I could see a path of disturbed grass where he’d gone barreling forward.  At that moment, I remember thinking, “This is bad…this is *really* bad.”  Sam and wandered much farther from the campsite than I, or anyone else, would’ve been comfortable with. I began panicking.  There were bears in the area and I shuddered to think what would happen if Sam startled one.  But before I could finish this train of thought, I noticed something strange.

Right as Sam’s footprints disappeared into the grass, a second pair of tracks seemed to meet them.  I knelt to get a closer look, and my brain did a summersault in my head.  Instead of footprints, Sam’s tracks were followed by what appeared to be handprints.  Fucking handprints.  The spacing of the tracks evoked images of a four-legged animal.  The whole scene was off-putting.  I felt like I was seeing something I shouldn’t.  Like a secret I was never meant to know.  It disturbed me. 

I looked back the way I’d come, the flicker of campfires like distant beacons in the dark.  Every fiber of my being wanted to run as fast as I could back towards the safety of the light.  Some ancient instinct compelled me towards the fire.  Towards the warmth.  Towards the safety.  For the first time in a long while, standing there at the sprawling meadow’s edge, the darkness of the night produced an icy and all-encompassing dread that seemed to freeze me in place.

Suddenly, I was at war with my desire to keep Sam safe, and my desire to feel safe myself.  I knew that in his eyes, I offered a sense of security.  My presence had given him the confidence boost needed to face his fear of the dark and step outside his comfort zone.  More than that though, I had been responsible for him.  The blame of the whole situation seemed to fall squarely on my shoulders.  He’d run off on my watch, and I’d let myself lose sight of him.  I needed to bring him back.

But I needed help.  I didn’t want to be alone out there.  I felt exposed and vulnerable.  Chasing Sam through the meadows alone at night, and the presence of those weird handprint tracks, compounded my fear.  I couldn’t bring myself to cross the threshold and follow into the grass.  Swallowing the lump in my throat and forcing my legs to move, I decided the best course of action was to return to camp and organize a group to better search.

As I followed my own tracks back towards camp, I felt a tickle at the back of my neck and my heart skipped a beat.  I felt eyes on me.  Pausing mid-stride, I scanned my surroundings.  My flashlight illuminated the trees and bushes as best it could, but not nearly so well as to banish the sensation.  The small gaps between the trees seemed like hungering voids, eager to swallow my light and leave me in the pitch blackness of the night.  I looked ahead and focused on the glow of the campfires.  It wasn’t much further. 

Focusing on the light, I took one steady step after another, trying my best to force the image of those handprints from my mind and ignore the sensation of being watched.  I’d probably taken another ten steps forward when I branch snapped behind me.  With a start, I wheeled around, and my flashlight illuminated none other than Sam.

I breathed a sigh of relief.  He was alright.  In the dim light he seemed a little shaken up and slightly covered in dirt and grass.  Perhaps he’d taken a fall in the meadow.  Regardless, all I could think was, “Great, crisis averted!  Returning Sam to camp with only a couple scrapes and bruises was much better than not returning with Sam at all.”  I gave him a stern lecture about running off like that and how unsafe he’d been to do so.  Sure, I knew he’d been scared, and I’d once been his age with my own irrational fears, so I didn’t come down on him too hard.  I was just happy to see him okay.

The entire time I lectured, he kept his eyes downcast, despite my flashlight only partially illuminating him.  He seemed rightfully sheepish but never uttered a word.  Not even a simple, “I’m sorry.”  I took a couple steps forward and reassured him that I wasn’t mad.  He turned away from me.  Almost like he didn’t want to make eye contact.  I called for him to follow me back, yet he remained frozen in place, his gaze fixated on the undergrowth.

I asked him if he was okay, but still he kept his mouth shut.  This was weird.  I felt my worry bubbling up again.  Had he been more rattled than I’d anticipated after being even just briefly lost in the woods?  Maybe I’d be bringing him back with a little more than just a scraped knee and dirty clothes.  I doubted he’d play flashlight tag again any time soon.

Resolving to put this disaster of a night behind us, I gently gestured for him to follow me. We could get him all cleaned up and warmed by the fire.  I turned and began walking back to camp.  The sound of Sam following soon followed, and I felt relieved that this whole mess would soon be over.  I’d had enough of this game, and frankly, I wanted nothing more than to get out of the dark woods and be back by the fire. 

As I continued onward, I heard Sam close behind me.  He didn’t sound well.  It was almost like he had a bad cold and was breathing strained and heavy through his nose.  Turning around, I shined my light on him and instantly he froze, once again turning to look away from me.  In the split second before his gaze shifted, my flashlight caught his eyes, and the blood in my veins froze.

Sam’s eyes reflected the light of my flashlight back at me.

My family owned a small cat at the time.  I’d seen her eyes do the exact same thing when reflecting a light source.  Seeing Sam’s eyes mimic this effect broke something in my brain.  I no longer felt like I was leading Sam back to safety.  The campsite was just ahead, and instead I found myself calculating just how fast I could reach the perimeter if I ran. 

Keeping my light fixed on Sam, I slowly took a step back.  Other things soon began to reveal themselves.  A long continuous cut ran up the length of both his underarms, starting at his wrists and disappearing beneath his sleeves.  Small beads of blood leaked along the edges, almost like thin incisions.  His left leg looked crooked, and I could see the dark and wet patches covering his jeans more clearly now.  They hadn’t been dirt stains.

Shaking, I softly called his name.  I wish I hadn’t gotten a reply. 

His jaw moved with a sickening crack but only produced low and raspy moans.  Eventually, those choked sounds formed a single, painfully strained word.

“Sam….?” 

My legs gave out as I stumbled backwards.  My flashlight slipped from my hands as I collapsed onto the forest floor.  As the light left the thing that stood before me, I watched as its gaze shifted forward, its neck cracking with each stuttering movement.  With slow lurching steps it advanced.  A deep, animal fear had taken over.  I couldn’t move.  With tears in my eyes, I watched as the thing loomed above me, wearing the face of my little cousin like a mask.  It leaned in close. I could smell it.  Thick and heavy, it stank like roadkill left to bake in the sun.  The stench was unbearable.  I felt bile rise in my throat.

Then the light of the fallen flashlight caught my eye.  Amidst the terror, I had an idea.  Whatever this thing was, it had averted its eyes when I’d faced it with the light.  The thing was nearly upon me.  It opened its mouth.  Row upon row of rotten, razor-sharp teeth filled its maw.  I had maybe seconds to pull off what I wasn’t even sure would work. 

I reached into my pocket, yanked out my phone, and hit the flashlight button.

I could see clearly now the inhumanity of it.  Those horrible dead eyes, pale and cloudy like spoiled milk.  The thing reeled back and screeched like nails on a chalkboard.  Clawing at its eyes, it drew deep crimson gashes across its face while writhing in pain.

In the precious few moments this bought me, I dove for my flashlight.  Grasping the cold metal, I turned to see the thing crawling towards me on all fours, the face of Sam now a pulpy mess of torn flesh.  I flashed my light directly into its face. Screaming in agony, it threw itself backwards before scampered away on all fours faster than I could blink.  Once again, I found myself alone in the woods.

A few moments of silence followed. My vision swam.  All I could hear was the sound of my own heaving breath.  I remained rooted in place as the sounds of shouting voices and heavy footfall approached from behind.  I don’t remember exactly what was said to me, but several members of my family, accompanied by a couple people from other campsites soon surrounded and filled my vision.

The events that followed were a blur.  According to my parents, all anyone could get out of me was a singular tearful word,

“Sam.”

I don’t remember much.  The park rangers’ questions.  The search party.  The dull shriek of sirens.  Everything blended into a slurry of sounds and lights.  All I could think about were those milky-white eyes staring into me, and that terrible way it had uttered Sam’s name.

I later learned from Sarah that search and rescue officers combed the surrounding woodlands for miles, but they never found anything.  Not a single sign of Sam.  Several members of my family refused to leave, insisting that they help search for him.  Sam’s parents, my aunt and uncle, had been nearly inconsolable.  It was all anyone could do to keep Sam’s dad from madly running off to conduct the search himself.  Knowing what I know, I’m glad, for his and his wife’s sake, that he didn’t.

Naturally, no one believed my story once I finally shared it.  They chalked it up to trauma.  It’s beyond me how anyone could believe that.  Sure, losing and searching for a family member alone in the woods at night was freaky, no one doubted that.  Why anyone would buy that as a valid reason for me to barely utter a word for several days, I’ll never understand.

Search efforts continued for weeks after my family finally left Yosemite.  Sam’s parents always held out hope that he’d be found, but it was painful to watch them grow more and more desperate as time dragged on.  Both grew cold and distant towards me.  Despite the assurance offered by my parents that it wasn’t my fault, I knew better than to believe that every family member shared their sentiment.  Whether they wanted to admit it or not, it was plain to see that some of them, even to the smallest degree, blamed me for what happened.

The search was eventually called off.  Not a single trace of Sam had been found.  My aunt and uncle refused to hold a funeral for him, despite most of the family accepting the cold reality that Sam was long gone.  He wasn’t coming back.  I’m only glad that they can still picture his face as they remember him.  All I can see are those eyes, and how they’d made me feel like “Prey” in the truest sense of the word.  Whenever I peer down a dark alleyway, or gaze into the shadowy corners of a room, I feel a small sliver of how I felt that night in Yosemite.

As a result of what happened, I developed a crippling fear of the dark that persists to this day.  As I said before, I can’t sleep with all the lights off, I keep high powered flashlights in both my nightstand and car, and candles are scattered throughout my apartment.  When I gaze out my windows at night, I am thankful for the glow of the city.  On the distant horizon however, I can see the silhouette of the mountains cutting into the night sky like teeth.  A constant reminder of what lurks out beyond the light’s reach.

Therapy has helped me cope, but never fully recover, and after the news I just received, I doubt I ever will.  Last week, my dad called me during work.  His voice was tight, and his words were curt.  Something had been found.

According to him, a report had come in from a group of campers.  They’d been doing some off-trail hiking when one of them broke off from the group to relieve themselves.  Half buried in the dirt near the base of a tree, they’d spotted something that stood out amongst the leaves, dirt, and twigs.  DNA testing was conclusive.  There could be no denying it.  Half hidden, sticking sharply out of the ground, had been what remained of Sam’s lower jaw.
