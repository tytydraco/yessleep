**I think I’ve started losing time, and my mind.. again.**

It’s really hard to keep track of it when your world’s reduced to the same four walls, the same pale ceiling, and the same broken body on the same fucking bed you've been lying in for weeks.

Life for me is just living in a prison of day and night and letting the time get the best of me as I feed on painkillers, liquid food and remain functional through some momentary exercises to test if I can still walk or balance myself. I don't sleep deep too - it's in little fragmented dreams between the clicks of melatonin tabs. 

Four months ago, I had an accident. I fell off my bike after a car crashed into me and I hit my head on a streetlight - then came a brain swelling and some nerve damage. I spent the first few weeks in the hospital, and now I’m home, mostly bedridden. I can move with effort - get to the bathroom, to the kitchen if I have to but I’ve been told not to push it. 

My wife’s been... incredible. Yes, too incredible. She’s been stuck here taking care of me like a full-time job . I felt selfish, and I saw it was taking a toll on her - the fatigue, haunted eyes, and nights she pretended to sleep but didn’t.

Last week, she broke down and said she wanted to spend a few days at her sister’s place across town. Just to breathe, or better, catch some sleep and rest. 

I told her to go. Hell, I insisted; now that I mustered up the strength to walk around and get some things done. Maybe that was my guilt talking, but I felt bad for tying her down, for becoming this palsied burden in a bed who needed help for the most trivial things. 

I can't blame myself entirely for my condition, but yes, I also cannot force her to be my slave.

So she left Thursday evening. She kissed my forehead and told me she **still** loved me - promising to call every morning. She said her brother would also drop by often, and that he had a set of spare keys to the front door, so I wouldn't have to get up to receive him.

To be honest, it did make me a bit uncomfortable and anxious.. you know. But I knew Ian quite well, so maybe I was just overthinking it. Whatever.

That night she left, I couldn’t tell when I fell asleep.

I was in that in-between state. What do you call it? ... yeah - *hypnagogic.* Drifting in and out. At some point, I happened to realize I was thirsty. Like really thirsty. My stomach hurt a little too. I hadn't eaten since maybe lunch?

So I got up. Walking had become more comfortable given the little amount of practice I did everyday, but well getting down the stairs was still an ordeal. I did make it downstairs, but halfway down, I heard something.

**Static. Voices. Laughter. A television.**

There’s a flat-screen in the living room that we barely use. It was on. Some sitcom was playing, I don't know which. The laugh track, it was strange .. like quite stuttering and tinny. 

The people on screen were speaking in a language I didn’t know. The colors looked off, and the quality was grainy like they’d been overexposed.

First I figured it was her brother Ian. But it wasn’t him, not at all.. this man was older, broader. His back was to me, posture relaxed, like he owned the place. Weirdly defiant and confident. 

**I should’ve panicked. I didn’t.**

Instead, I just stood there, watching the back of his head, and for some reason… I felt like I *knew* him. Like not well, but well enough to trust that he wasn’t a threat. I walked a little closer, and he turned his head slightly toward me without looking away from the TV. 

*“Thought you’d be asleep,”* he said. His voice was rather calm, almost amused. *“Rachel told me you wouldn’t wake up till morning.”,* he chuckled.

I blinked. "*Sorry.. who, .. who are you?"*

*“Oh. Cal,"* he said turning his face to mine, like he was remembering something important. *"Her stepfather. Didn't we meet in 2013? ... at your wedding?”*

My stomach tightened.

"*She asked me to stay while she was gone."* he added. *"Said you’ve been acting weird and needed someone to be around.. I figured I had nothing better to do. How've you been holding up, sonny?”*

His name lit something in the back of my head.. some old photo maybe. Wedding day? 

I didn’t push it. I just nodded and acted like I remembered. But something inside me *wanted him to leave.* Yes, *leave*.

*“I guess I don’t need anything."* I mumbled, *"Sorry for not recognizing you immediately - I was told Ian would be coming over."* 

*"Yeah, Ian. I told him to stay home."* he said. *"Just take care of her, alright? She's been through enough. And now that you're doing better... make sure she stays safe.*" 

There was a smirk on his face, something unreadable behind it. I don't know why, but I asked, *"Could you leave the spare key here?"*

His smile faltered, just for a second, like he was offended. He pulled the key off his ring and flicked it onto the mantelpiece, then turned toward the door. 

*"Alright,"* he said. *"Take care."* and he left without another word.

I locked the door after him - also checking the windows. Drank some water. I made my way back up to my bed.

As I slept, I told myself it was nice that someone still cared about Rachel. That she had people watching out for her. Then I slept. Fast.. and deep.

I woke up around 11 a.m. the next day - sunlight already bleeding through the blinds. For a while I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself the night before had actually happened.

Had Cal really come over? Had I actually gotten up? The dull ache in my legs said yes. But the way my memory melted around the edges… it felt more like a weird lucid dream. 

I didn’t have long to think.

I heard her voice from downstairs, calling my name. It had this brittle edge to it, like she was holding something back. Maybe she came home late last midnight? 

I called out to let her know I was awake. A few minutes later, she was standing at the door to my room (yeah, we slept separately - I needed the entire bed).

She didn’t walk in right away. Just stood there, staring at me.

*“What?”* I asked, forcing a smile. She shook her head. “Nothing. Just… don’t look at me like that.”

*“Like what?”* I wasn't even making a face. Not my first time hearing this either. Does she not like how I look?

*“Like… never mind. You remind me of someone.”* she said, stepping into the room. Her eyes darted to the nightstand where my meds were. *“Did you take your pills yet?”*

I nodded. She sat on the edge of the bed, her shoulders tense. I asked her how the visit to her sister went. She shrugged. *“It was okay. Kind of hard to relax last night though.”*

*“Why? Did she give you trouble all week?”* She hesitated. ***“No. You did.”***

I blinked. *“Me?”* 

Her voice cracked a little. *“I woke up in the middle of the night. You were sitting by my bed.”* There was a long silence.

She kept going, like she’d rehearsed this. “*You were just sitting there, eyes wide open, staring at me. Didn’t say anything. Just… watching. I called your name ... and you didn’t even flinch!?”*

*“I-”* My mouth went dry. *“I didn’t- I wasn’t- even at your sister's place!??”*

She dismissed, *"Not at her place! Early this morning. By my bed. As I slept.. I came home at 3 A.M. last night."*

*“...That's .. that’s not the first time, either,”* she said. *“I’ve been hearing things at night. Stuff falling. Doors creaking. I thought maybe the meds were messing with your sleep or something. But seeing you just… there, beside me, not blinking- What were you doing?”*

She stopped, wiped at her eyes with the sleeve of her hoodie.

I felt sick. I wanted to say I had no memory of that. That I couldn’t have — I *couldn’t* have, not in the shape I was in. But her voice was real. 

Her fear was real. And part of me was afraid that maybe I had gotten up. **Maybe it** ***was*** **me.**

I thought about telling her about the night before. About Cal. But *something* stopped me. She already looked like she was barely holding it together.

Instead, I just said I was sorry. That I didn’t know what was going on, but I’d talk to someone. That maybe I needed to up my dosage or see my neurologist again...

She nodded and stood up, muttering something about making coffee. I wanted to call out to her to stop her, to ask why she said I reminded her of someone earlier.

**But the words got caught somewhere between my chest and throat.**

I lay there for hours after she left the room. Trying to remember if I’d ever seen Cal’s face before. Trying to remember *what he looked like*. But every time I got close, something changed.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Now I started to hear and feel things. 

Maybe it was what Rachel said. Maybe it was the image of myself, just sitting there, motionless, watching her breathe. That idea crawled under my skin and just... stayed there like a creepy image you couldn't get your eyes off.

I kept trying to tell myself that if I had walked to her room, I would’ve remembered. I would’ve felt it.

But what if I didn’t?

I was hypnagogic again. I heard something more distinct - soft, muffled footsteps over the floorboards. Not loud, but careful.

I stayed in bed at first. Tried to tell myself it was nothing. Maybe the pipes? Maybe Rachel forgot to turn something off.... but the sound didn’t stop. 

And I got this terrible, *absolute* feeling that something was happening I wasn’t supposed to miss.

So I got up, raising myself from the pain. 

Each step was painful. Slow... dragging and terrible.

I didn’t want to wake her, didn’t want her to see me like this. But I needed to check. I needed to make sure I wasn’t turning into something that moved when I didn’t know. 

The hallway was dark. Her door was half open. I saw the moonlight on the sheets. I didn’t breathe.

There was someone in the room.

**Me.**

It was me, standing at the edge of the bed, just looking down at her. My hands were hanging limp by my sides, but there was something tight about the shoulders - like they were coiling.

My wife was asleep, her breathing soft and oblivious. 

I couldn’t move for a second. Couldn’t even think. I just stared, trying to understand what I was seeing. ***It*** wasn’t moving. 

Just watching her, head slightly tilted, the way I imagine I looked when she saw me beside her bed.

And then.. it leaned forward.

Both hands rising. Reaching for her throat, beginning to apply pressure. I could see it smirk from the distance, and begin to grunt. 

I didn’t think. I just ran, or tried to - straddling at the fastest pace I could. 

I broke into a guttural cry, panicking, I launched at him. At *me*. I grabbed his arms, his shoulder and he was warm, and solid.. I still remember that. He turned around, and I saw... 

... I saw nothing.

No one, .. and then I looked down, and my hands were on her. My fingers were curled around the collar of her shirt, close to her neck. She was gasping. Eyes wide and crying.

I stumbled back like I’d been struck, confused- where did the apparition go?. 

***“No,”*** I said. ***“No, no, I didn’t just ... I wasn’t tryi-”***

She curled into herself, sobbing. I reached for her, hands crawling to her on her bed and she visibly flinched.

*“I don’t know what’s happening,”* I said. *“I don’t know... I swear to God, Rachel, I thought..”*

She was shaking her head. *“No... No.. NO! You need help!"* she screamed. *“This is serious! I’m going to call someone.... No..., this isn’t safe!”*

I started crying too. I wasn’t even trying to hold it in anymore. I couldn’t. I was broken. I’d broken her.

“*I don’t mean to,”* I kept saying. *“I don’t want to hurt you. I’d never— you know that. I’d never.”*

She didn’t answer. She just stared at the floor, still hugging herself. ***"Stop looking at me like that! Stop!"*** she suddenly burst out. ***"Why are you smiling!? Do you enjoy this?"*** she gasped in disbelief.

I froze. Smiling? I wasn't smiling, not at all. I didn't think I was. My face felt numb. I wiped at my mouth with the back of my hand. Nothing.. no smirk.

*"Rachel... Rachel.. what's wrong?!"* I bawled, my voice cracking, body shaking. I crawled back. 

She just kept crying, curled up like a child. And then... I don't know why I asked it. Maybe because I needed it to make sense? 

Maybe because... some part of me still wanted to believe it wasn't *me*.

*“Did you tell your stepfather about what’s been happening?”* I mumbled. *“About me sleepwalking or, my health - or me looking off or whatever? Because... he said something the other night.”*

She looked up, confused. Her face pale, choking on her tears. ***“What?”***

*“Cal."* I said. *"Your stepdad? He came over that night you left... He said you asked him to come and stay."* I added, *"Said.. you were worried about me, that I'd been acting weird. He told me to take care of you."*

She didn’t move.

*“Rachel?”* I asked again, voice trembling.

She blinked. And then, slowly, she said, ***“Cal’s dead.”***

The room collapsed inward. My mouth went dry.

*“He strangled my mom... while.. while she was asleep.”* she said, her voice cracking. *“3 years ago. Then.. he killed himself... Don’t you.. don't you remember that?”*

I didn’t respond. Because no, I didn’t. Or maybe I did.

**But if I did... who was it that came over that night?**

**Because if I remember it now... it means he remembers me too.**
