I Am the Reason Your Prayers Went Unanswered.

I don't mean this in a witchy or voodoo-esque way either; I'm not spending my time down in my basement making wax replicas of each of you individually, then sprinkling lime juice on them, or stabbing toothpicks through them while burning sage from a human skull brazier. 

That would be barbaric. No, what I do is clinical. Proven. Far removed from such acts of Paganism, in fact. You see, your prayers don't get answered, because mine do, or rather, those of my investors do… did… and the world will only permit so many little miracles at a time, right?

Wrong. 

Were it so simple, my work would continue, albeit slowly. If probability could be so easily shifted without consequence, perhaps my life would still have a chance to go on. Unfortunately, miracle work is a bit more complicated than that. If only I had known this sooner… I don't know how much longer I have.



I began my career as a cognitive behavioral therapist, fresh out of UGA with a six-year Master's in psychology. Put simply, my job was to help individuals break unhealthy thought and behavior patterns and teach them healthier, approved coping mechanisms.

One of the methods I would use to break cycles of negative thought patterns is called affirmations. If you have ever heard of “manifesting,” then you probably already have a decent understanding of affirmations, as the process is basically the same. Instead of negative thoughts, like “I am a failure, and I'll never finish this story,” I taught people to think positive thoughts, like “I can grow from this, I will continue writing one paragraph at a time.” For most individuals, introducing these positive thought patterns was a benefited their lives, and resulted in higher overall mood and self-esteem.

Key word: Most.

For a few, the affirmations became borderline narcissistic in nature and unreasonable; beyond the scope of what any person could actually accomplish with just positive thoughts, and some affirmations that seemingly transcended possibility altogether. They would share their affirmations with me in our scheduled sessions, and where most people would have mantras on the level of “I am an okay person, and nobody actually hates me,” these patients’ mantras would be more similar to “I will be the greatest there ever was at ‘X’ sport,” or “I will get promoted to CEO at work.” 

While I did not encourage these thought patterns, I also did not discourage them as much as I should have, in hindsight. So what if they never became the best baseball player ever, or still got passed up for promotions at work? It still gave them a goal to work towards. Overly positive thoughts are still better than negative thoughts, right?

Wrong.



It all started with Jeanine. Jeanine was a twenty-something novelist hopeful with seven unpublished novels sitting dormant on her laptop's hard drive. She came in one day and, after our usual banter and debrief of the previous couple of weeks, she shared her new affirmations with me.

“I will get a book published.” She said, a somewhat reasonable goal. “I will be successful.” A markedly less achievable goal. “The book will make a best-seller list in the first month.” A completely absurd endeavor, I thought to myself. 

“Good, Jeanine! Those are some big goals. Have you started the process yet?” I asked, my doubts pushed to the back of my mind, where they would not help my face to betray me.

“No! But like you've said, I can do anything I put my mind to! And I've been praying my affirmations daily!” She almost shouted, gleefully. 

Praying? That was an unusual way to put it, but not so unusual at the time to warrant questioning her. She had said in a previous session that she was religious, after all.

“Good! Now set a realistic timeline for yourself so you stay on track!” I oozed, attempting to both mirror and temper her enthusiasm in the same sentence.

“Hmm, how does two months sound?” She beamed. Two months to write a novel seemed wild to me, but two months to write, get published, and top a chart? Insanity.

“Are you sure you don't want to make this a more long-term goal, Jeanine?” I spoke as if I were trying to defuse a bomb with my words, afraid that too much negativity would cause a regression.

“No, I'm pretty confident! I plan to start writing today!” She said, her smile only growing wider, and as soon as the final syllable left her lips, the little egg timer I used to keep to a standard one-hour session chimed. “See you in a couple of weeks!”

She was gone before I could say another word. 

In her next session, she mentioned that she had experienced a sudden burst of inspiration and was almost completely through writing a new novel. In the following session, the novel was completed, and she spoke of multiple publishers getting back to her, interested not only in the novel she had submitted, but also in anything else that had come of her “genius” mind. 

She did not come to the session after that one; instead, she sent me a signed copy of her book. The cover art was a dark silhouette of a person from the shoulder up, with thin white streaks branching out from it. At the bottom left corner, a bright golden seal gleamed up at me. 

Best Seller, Georgia Times.

I was given a bold, praising mention on the very first page of the book with lettering:
“Special thanks to Dr. Edmund, none of this would have been possible without your positive guidance!” 

It shouldn’t have been possible, even with my guidance. 

The name of my practice and my business phone number were also mentioned, followed by the tagline “Call for a miracle!”

I was no doctor, but even so, the calls came in. Within a week, every open time-slot was filled, and I was working almost every day, around the clock, just to keep up. Nothing changed about the way I practiced my craft, and, for the most part, nothing changed in the lives of those who sought my aid.

It only took a few months for the hype to wear off, and my list of clients to dwindle to only slightly-above-average numbers, but, unfortunately, the new clients weren’t the only ones who took notice of Jeanine’s little “miracle.”



“Rising local author, Jeanine ____ missing from her Georgia home. Foul play suspected. Please call local law enforcement if you have any information that may lead to …(read more)”

The notification from the news app on my phone made my breath catch in my throat, and my right hand release the spoon that was hanging precariously above my bowl of Frosted Flakes. Before my finger could even obey the thought to tap (read more), three loud knocks rang out from my front door. I was not expecting company.

“Police,” the disembodied voice rang through my house, “we are here to discuss the disappearance of Jeanine _____. We just want to talk.”

I hesitantly stood up and made my way to the door. The frosted glass made determining who lay beyond nigh impossible, and when I tried to take a peek through the peephole, I found it to be covered.

“I was just her therapist, I didn’t really know her personally,” I said, but the voice at the door insisted. I unlocked the door, and as if on cue, it burst inwards, knocking me to the ground. Three men entered my home: two wearing tactical gear and carrying large, heavy-looking black flashlights, and a third wearing a suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.

The two tactically geared men grabbed my arms, clasped my wrists together with handcuffs that seemed too heavy for their size, and led me to my couch. The well-dressed man laid his briefcase out on my coffee table and spoke. “Scan the house. No more uncontained witnesses.” His accent was unreadable, and his tone plain and flat. The men left our presence and began throwing doors open as he turned to me directly.

“Mr. Edmund, I presume?” His words sounded more like a statement than a question. “Call me Mr. H. I'm sure you have an idea of why we're here?”

“Yes… Sir?” I responded timidly, still rubbing at the arm that I’d landed on only moments before. Truthfully, my only hint was what they shouted before kicking my door in, but I still got the hint.

“We understand that you played a part in this woman's sudden rise to fame? Her little miracle?” He slid a photo across the table to me. It was Jeanine, bound and gagged in a dark room, makeup running down her face, and Subject N-94 stamped at the bottom in blocky lettering.

“Hardly, sir. I was just her therapist. I couldn't believe it either when she wrote the entire novel in just a month,” I said truthfully, motioning to the book, which sat closed at the opposite edge of the table from Mr. H.

He gave it only a cursory glance before looking back at me, slight confusion tugging at his brow. Before he had a chance to continue, the two other men returned to the room. 

“Nobody else here, sir.” The first said, holstering his flashlight.

“No abnormal LF readings either, not even a hair above base…” the second started to say, before the small box with an antenna in his hand began to beep slowly, “hang on, I'm getting a reading in here.”

He circled slowly around the living room, pointing the antenna first at me, then to the floor, neither of which produced any measurable difference. Finally, he pointed it at the book on the coffee table.

Beep. Beep. Beep. -KZZZZKT-

The small box emitted a string of beeps, followed by shrill static. The man holding it turned a dial and moved it closer to the book, which resulted in it emitting a noise reminiscent of a choir singing slightly out of key. The man spoke, peering down at a small digital display on the device: “Residual LF readings. Pattern congruent with Subject N-94's signature.”

Mr. H gazed up at the men and nodded, prompting them to unhandcuff me. I rubbed at my wrists where the metal had pressed into them. There was something wrong about that metal, unholy even. This would not be my last run-in with what I would later learn to be called Longinium.

“Very well, Mr. Edmund. I believe you now, you're entirely clueless,” Mr. H said, a slight smirk curling the edges of his lips. I breathed a shaky sigh of relief, and he continued, “But there is still the matter of what to do with you. You know too much. Hell, everyone who read that book knows too much, but they all at least think it's just some torture-porn sci-fi novel.”

“You mean… it isn't?” I asked, my jaw never returning to its natural position. The contents of that book had to be fiction… gods… demons… the Fates… there was no way any of that could be real… right? That must mean…

“You work for H…” I tried to say, but couldn't finish my sentence, as one of the men standing behind me walloped me in the back, knocking the wind out of me. 

Mr H's smirk grew to a grin. “And now you know even more that you shouldn't,” he oozed as he eyed me greedily, “Yet, you may actually be useful to us. Tell me, doctor, what are your methods?”

Fearing the alternative to being found “useful” to Mr. H and his goons, I recounted the events leading up to and following Jeanine’s final session with me. In the beginning, the faces of the other three men remained unreadable. Then I got to the session where she shared her three final affirmations with me. Mr. H's face betrayed fascination when I mentioned her method of affirming her goals.

“Prayer? Who was she praying to? Did she mention a name? A deity? A specific religion, even?” He questioned, and either interest or worry caused his voice to rise an octave higher than the gruff one he had forced previously.

“No, sir, she simply stated that she was praying her affirmations daily,” I relayed, “she mentioned she was religious, but never said which one.”

Mr. H stood, his hands shaking slightly, and spoke his next words slowly and deliberately. “I hope you’re right. Religions are useful, doctor. They bind belief to a greater power, something outside of one's own control. Without that binding… and without the self-limiting factors of doubt and fear, things like her are dangerous.”

“Things like her? What is she?” I asked, my head tilting to the side automatically.

His eyes met mine, and his next word inexplicably evoked a sense of terror I had not felt since childhood.

“Fallen.”



For the first year or so, I was not allowed to leave the bunker. I had skills that they found useful, but I was untrusted, unproven, and considered an information leak risk. How ironic that it is only now, after the better half of a decade, that I finally come forward and tell my story. After gaining their trust. If only they’d been honest with me from the start, but who knows? Maybe they didn’t even know the full extent of our meddling.

That was seven years ago. I have come to learn that Mr. H’s terminology is always intentionally vague. I am still not entirely certain what a Fallen is, what exactly differentiates them from baseline humanity, or what they are truly capable of without guide rails in place. In fact, I am left in the dark about most things, despite my until-recently thriving business relationship with Mr. H and his employer. I have, however, seen a glimpse of why they are so dangerous if not contained. First-hand.

My job within the organization was actually quite similar to my job before I was recruited, save a few key factors: 

I was paid by the month, not per client (though the pay was much better than I could ever dream of earning doing individual clients by myself) 
I no longer could choose my clients (which official documentation referred to as conduits, but that term is much too impersonal for my profession); they are chosen for me.
Clients always came in sets of three.
Clients’ affirmations were pre-written by the organization.
Clients stayed with me until their goals were accomplished. I never saw the same individual more than once, either.

The oddest parts of this unusual situation, however, were the affirmations themselves. They weren’t personal, like normal affirmations should be, nor were they designed to benefit the affirmer in any way that I could tell; they often involved major regime changes, large amounts of money passing hands, beginnings and ends of wars, and, one time, the results of a Super Bowl. Additionally, each individual did not present themselves to me with different affirmations; they were always the same. All three clients would be focused on the same outcome of the same event.

It wasn’t until I found the document that my mundane day-to-day began to grow heavy on my conscience. The bundle of papers had seemingly been slipped under my office door while I was away on vacation, and consisted of several lists of previous clients’ affirmations and outcomes of the session. I immediately recognized this document because I, in fact, was the one who created it; however, taped to the back of the spreadsheet was a small, indigo colored flashdrive, with a single word written on it in black marker.

Consequences.

My heart skipped a beat, and I immediately looked around to ensure that I wasn’t being watched. Weary of plugging this serendipitously discovered flash drive into my surely-monitored work terminal, I opted instead to browse it using my personal laptop, disconnected from any source of internet or intranet connection, and housed within a virtual machine, just in case it was viral. My worries about cybersecurity were quickly replaced with a deep dread as line after line of data populated on my screen. The majority of the document remained the same as the paper copy I held in my hands only moments before, except for an additional column.

Counterbalance.

For every seemingly neutral or positive event that had transpired under my direction, tragedy and loss-of-life coincided. 

Affirmation: The Los Angeles Rams Will Win Super Bowl in 2022. Outcome: Successful. Counterbalance: Rising tension in Eastern Europe, leading to an ongoing mass casualty event.

Affirmation: A Major Regime Change in the Middle. East. Outcome: Moderate Success. Counterbalance: Unexplainable hurricane formation over the Atlantic. Mass casualty event.

Affirmation: A Foreign Power will overtake a major US industry. Outcome: Moderate Success. Counterbalance: Sudden earthquakes in Asia, unusual winter weather in the US. Mass casualty event.

The list went on and on, page after page of tragedies, all an indirect result of my work. A counterbalance to my meddling with Fate. I read all the way down to the bottom line, expecting to see my most recent session’s affirmations and results, but I was instead met with an unfinished entry dated for the day I left for vacation.

Affirmation: Mr. Edmund will be met with a terrible fate. Outcome: TBD. Counterbalance: TBD.
