I’d been hearing about weighted blankets for months. They were supposed to be calming, like a warm hug that helps you sleep better. So, one gloomy Sunday afternoon, I decided to buy one. It wasn’t one of those fancy, brand-name blankets; it was an odd one I found in a dim corner of a thrift store. The tag was faded, but the blanket was heavy in my arms, comforting even. It had a soft, velvety cover, and for only $20, I figured it was a steal.

That night, as I wrapped myself in its weight, I felt a soothing pressure that quickly lulled me to sleep. But that first night wasn’t exactly restful. I woke up a few times to a strange, musty smell. I shrugged it off, thinking it was just the "thrift store scent." But as the days went by, the smell got worse.

At first, it was faint, like old, damp laundry. But by the end of the week, it was unbearable—like rotting garbage left out in the sun. No matter how much air freshener I sprayed, the stench seemed to cling to every corner of my bedroom. My sleep, which had been so peaceful that first night, turned restless. I had nightmares of being smothered, heavy shadows pressing down on my chest.

By the second week, I’d had enough. I decided to take it to a local laundry center. I dragged the smelly blanket into the car, gagging as the odor filled the small space. When I got to the laundromat, the attendant eyed me curiously as I shoved the blanket into an industrial washer. I fed the machine quarters, but nothing happened. A small screen flashed: **"Error: Metal Detected."**

Confused, I called the attendant over. She fiddled with the machine, then looked at me with a furrowed brow. "There’s something inside," she said, pointing at the blanket. "It has metal in it. It can't be washed here."

Frustrated and slightly creeped out, I took the blanket back home. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, the blanket on the floor in the corner of the room, oozing its horrific stench. There was no way I could keep it like this, so I decided to open it up and see what was inside.

I grabbed a pair of scissors and began to cut along the seam. As I made the first snip, a foul, almost choking stench burst forth, so intense that I staggered back, covering my nose. My eyes watered, but I forced myself to continue cutting. I peeled back the fabric, and that’s when I saw it.

The blanket wasn’t filled with beads or weights. Inside, there were chunks of something… fleshy. I hesitated, then used the scissors to poke one of the pieces. It was soft, pliable, and smeared with dark, dried patches that looked disturbingly like blood. My heart pounded as I dug further, pulling out what looked like the remnants of bones, fragments of teeth embedded in the blanket’s filling.

My stomach lurched as the realization hit me: **human remains.** I dropped the blanket and stumbled back, knocking over a lamp in my panic. The room spun, the smell engulfing me, pressing in from all sides like the nightmare that the blanket had become. How many nights had I slept beneath this… thing? How many nights had I been comforted by its hideous weight?

As I backed away, I heard a soft, almost imperceptible whisper emanate from the blanket, like a distant sigh: **"You… found me."**

I ran from the room, slamming the door behind me. The blanket, that once soothing embrace, had transformed into a harbinger of terror. And now, it felt like I’d woken something that had lain dormant inside it… something that wasn’t quite ready to be discovered.
