"Main Control, this is Commander Quill. Ready for liftoff, systems are green, and all pre-flight checks are complete," I spoke through the intercom. 

"Copy that, Commander. All systems on our end are green as well. You're cleared for launch." The voice on the other end is cool, focused. A stark contrast to my jittery nerves. 

"Fuel is locked, all modules are functioning. Starting countdown now... five minutes." I spoke as firmly and confidently as I could.

"Understood. We’re tracking. Good luck, Commander. We’ll be here when you return."

"Copy that." I shifted my focus to the final checks, triple checking everything. 

"T-minus five minutes and counting," said the voice on the intercom. Once I was sure everything was correct, I leaned back in my seat and took a deep breath. 

The steady hum of the ship’s systems filled the cabin, a low, constant vibration that I could feel in my bones. My fingers drummed lightly on the armrest, a subconscious rhythm to match the pulse in my ears. Five minutes had never felt so long.

I glanced out the viewport. The endless stretch of space yawned before me — an infinite canvas of black, flecked with stars that flickered like distant lanterns. It was beautiful, yes, but it was also a stark reminder of how alone I was about to be. No rescue. No second chances. Just me, the ship, and whatever waited on the other side of that jump.

Four minutes, thirty seconds. The countdown echoed through the intercom, crisp and mechanical.

“Stay sharp, Commander,” came a familiar voice. Davis. We met as initiates, and he’d been on every call since training, always calm, always steady. “You’ve done this a hundred times in the sim. No surprises, right?”

“Right,” I muttered, gripping the armrests tighter than I needed to. “No surprises.” But we both knew that wasn’t true. No simulation could prepare you for the unknown. That was the whole point of being first.

Humans have been exploring the reaches of space for a century now. It started with the discovery of Kepler-452b, once we had the technology to move there, it's been a race to populate the universe. 

Four minutes. 

There was a new planet discovered. Outside the parameter of explored space. Experts say it has all the key signs of a habitable planet. My mission is to ensure that's true. 

Three minutes, thirty seconds.

I watched the time tick by, until it reached one minute remaining. 

The intercom crackled with static before Davis's voice cut through again, steadier than my pulse. "Final systems check, Commander. Thrusters?"

"Green," I replied, eyes darting to the display. Every status bar gleamed a reassuring shade of emerald.

"Navigation?"

"Locked and calibrated." My voice sounded more confident than I felt.

"Life support?"

"Fully operational," I confirmed, feeling the subtle hiss of air cycling through the cabin. Not that it would matter if something went wrong mid-jump. There wouldn't be time to notice.

"Alright," Davis said, his tone softening just a bit. "Breathe, Commander Quill. You’re not just ready — you were built for this."

Thirty seconds.

My heart thudded against my ribs like it was trying to break free. I leaned forward, gaze locked on the viewport. Beyond the shimmer of the ship's nose, space stretched in every direction, vast and indifferent. Somewhere out there was the planet they’d dubbed "Eden-7." I’d seen the satellite scans — blue oceans, green landmasses, clouds swirling in tight, elegant spirals. It looked like home. It felt like home.

Fifteen seconds.

The hum of the ship deepened into a resonant thrum. The whole cabin quivered as the jump drive began to spool up. I exhaled slowly, letting the weight in my chest dissolve with the breath.

"See you on the other side, Davis," I said.

"Copy that, Commander," he replied, and for the first time, I heard it — the crack in his steady voice. "We’ll be here."

Five.

Four.

Three.

Two.

One.

A sharp snap reverberated through the cabin, like the crack of a whip next to my ear. My stomach lurched as every atom in my body felt like it had been pulled apart and reassembled in the space of a heartbeat. Light exploded in the viewport, a storm of color so brilliant it hurt to look at — ribbons of violet, spirals of gold, and flashes of crimson that danced like lightning in slow motion.

Then everything went still.

No hum. No thrum. No sound at all.

-

I watched as miles and miles of space, stars, and stardust crept alongside the ship. Hours passed, silent and cold. Then days. Then months. I thought about the reasons I joined NASA, my desperate need to get as far away from that planet as I could. I shook the memories away. 

Time crept by as I squinted into the nothingness, searching for the planet, when I could finally make out the distant shape of my target. As I neared it, I was in awe. It was much more lush than earth. Rich greens and blues swirling over the surface, a paradise in waiting. 

The planet filled the viewport like a rising tide of color. Eden-7. It was bigger than I’d imagined, its curvature stretching further than Earth's horizon ever had. Thick, swirling clouds moved sluggishly over continents teeming with green. Not just green, though — flashes of deep red, amber, and even streaks of silver foliage caught the sun's light. The oceans were a crystalline blue so pure it looked like polished glass.

I sat back, breath caught in my chest like it didn’t want to leave. I’d trained for this. I’d seen the simulations, memorized every geological report, every atmospheric scan. None of it had prepared me for the feeling of it — the weight of seeing something so alive from so far away.

The ship’s console blinked with a soft chime, pulling me back. Proximity alert. Orbit stabilization required.

“Alright, Eden,” I muttered, fingers tapping across the controls. “Let’s do this dance.”

I eased the ship into orbit, feeling the subtle shift of inertia as the planet's gravity took hold. The ship’s AI, SPECTR, chimed in with a smooth, even tone from my arm device. 

“Orbital lock achieved, Commander Quill. Atmospheric conditions within expected parameters. Oxygen-nitrogen mix at 78:21 ratio. Temperature gradient stable. No detected radiation anomalies.”

SPECTR, standing for Systems Processing and Enhanced Computation for Terrestrial Reconnaissance, was the AI system implanted into our ProximaLink when we get our career chip.

“Anything you didn’t expect, SPECTR?” I asked, running a final sweep of the planet's electromagnetic field.

“Affirmative,” SPECTR replied. “Unidentified energy signatures detected on surface. Origin unknown.”

I felt my gut churn. “Open the radar.”

A map of Eden-7 flickered to life, a 3d hologram of the planet. I zoomed in and searched for any signs of life of the planet, and could only find the sole heat signature of my location. Topographic lines marked the mountains, valleys, and oceans, all familiar from the satellite scans. Nothing looked out of the ordinary. My brow furrowed. 

"Dismiss." The map vanished. 

The soft hum of the ship's systems filled the silence, but it wasn’t enough to calm the gnawing sense of unease coiling in my chest. Unidentified energy signatures. "Unknown origin" was SPECTR-speak for "we have no idea what it is, but it’s definitely not natural."

I stood, rolling the stiffness out of my shoulders, and moved to the storage locker. My fingers hovered over the EVA suit. Every part of me knew better than to rush planetside after that kind of report, but curiosity is a louder voice than caution when you're alone in orbit.

"Prep the drop pod, SPECTR," I said, grabbing the suit.

"Protocol recommends extended observation before planetary descent."

"I know the protocol, SPECTR. I also know I’m not going to learn anything just staring at it." I stepped into the suit, seals hissing as it pressurized around me. "Prep it."

"Affirmative. Drop pod primed for descent."

Moments later, I was locked into the pod’s cramped seat, heart thudding against my ribs. The launch countdown echoed in my earpiece. The slight shudder of clamps releasing was followed by a weightless moment of silence before gravity took me. Fire streaked across the viewport as I cut through Eden-7’s atmosphere.

The clouds were denser than expected, thicker swirls of copper and pearl that hugged the pod as it plummeted. Visibility dropped to nothing. Only the roar of descent filled my ears.

“Impact in 20 seconds. Descent velocity within acceptable range,” SPECTR said, calm as ever.

I gripped the harness tight as trees and mountains emerged from the mist below — sharp, sudden, too close. The ground rushed up. I braced.

Impact.

The world jolted hard. My teeth clicked together as the pod crunched into the soil, tossing me forward against the restraints. The hiss of hydraulics signaled the release of the hatch. The atmosphere seeped in, warmer and wetter than I expected.

Unclipping the harness, I stepped out into a new world, a low hum all around me. Not just birdsong or the rustle of wind, it was everywhere, a low, layered vibration just beneath the edge of hearing. The colors were richer than they’d seemed from orbit. Emerald leaves shimmered with a metallic sheen. The red foliage dripped with something thicker than dew. The air tasted faintly sweet, like overripe fruit.

"SPECTR, you picking this up?" I asked, glancing at my suit’s biometrics. Everything read nominal, but my heart rate was higher than it should have been.

"Affirmative, Commander. Localized subsonic frequencies detected. No known terrestrial match."

I walked forward, pushing my way through the thick foliage, boots sinking into the soil. A clearing opened ahead, sunbeams cascading through the copper-tinged canopy. I got past the last few branches and my heart dropped. There, sat in the center of the field, was my childhood home. The earth tree, long dead and adorned with a tire swing, stood out against the vivid flora surrounding it. 

Tentatively, against everything in my head screaming to turn back, I took a step. Then another. Flashes of the awful memories made in this building filled my head, but it was as if my feet had a mind of their own. 

I approached the tree slowly, each step heavy, as if my body were trying to resist but couldn’t. The air around me seemed thicker now, the sweet scent from earlier replaced by something sour, like the bitter taste of regret. The house, the tire swing—everything looked too real, too alive. The scene was almost identical to how I remembered it, down to the worn patches on the front porch.

I stood at the edge of the lawn, my breath shallow as I tried to convince myself this was just a hallucination. Maybe it was the isolation, the long months of space travel, maybe a mix of stress, but my mind was playing tricks on me. It had to be.

"Commander, I advise caution," SPECTR’s voice crackled through my earpiece, sharp in the sudden silence. "Biometric readings indicate elevated cortisol levels. You are experiencing heightened emotional response."

I exhaled sharply, pushing down the tight knot in my chest. "I know. I’m not... I’m not imagining this. I need to go inside."

I moved forward, up the creaky steps of the porch. The door was ajar. Hesitation rippled through me, but the pull to return was overwhelming, like gravity itself had reasserted control over me. I reached out, pushed the door open.

The interior was exactly as I remembered, the floral couch with the wear and tear of age in the corner, the sound of the wind whispering through the open window. I could almost hear the echoes of my mothers screams for my father to stop, glass breaking, doors slamming. The air felt thick here. Suffocating.

“Commander?” SPECTR’s voice broke through my trance. “I detect rapid fluctuations in your neural patterns. You are not responding to external stimuli. Please… get back in the pod.”

I ignored the warning. My legs moved before I could stop them, carrying me deeper into the house, past the old photos on the wall, the kitchen where I had once shared meals with my family. Everything was so real. The vibrations in the air hummed in sync with the pounding of my heart. I could feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, the familiar creak of the floorboards underfoot.

Then I saw her.

In the doorway of the living room—tall, silhouetted in the dim light. My mother. Her outline was clear, but there was something off about the way she stood, too still, like she was waiting for me. 

I froze, a rush of adrenaline making my vision blur, my pulse hammering in my ears. As i was able to focus my vision, I noticed she was wearing the same thing she wore on the last day I saw her. 

Then she started moving, humming cheerfully, making her way past me to the laundry room. It was like she didn't even see me. 
“Oh, hello hon, I didn't think you'd be home yet," she said, her voice soft, like honey dripping from a spoon. I whipped my head around, to see her speaking not to me, but to my father, making his way through the entrance. His expression was grim.

I took a step backward, my instincts screaming at me to run, but my feet felt stuck. “No…” I whispered. “This isn’t real."

I knew what happened next. What he did after she finally went to the police due to my incessant urging. 

The air around me vibrated, more aggresively now, as if the house itself was alive, feeding on my fear, my guilt, my memories. I could feel my heart pounding louder, faster, my breath coming in shallow gasps. My pulse was a drumbeat, steady and insistent. I crouched down and covered my ears, but it did nothing to dampen the sound of the gunshot, then the sound of her falling to the ground. I looked up to see my father stood over her body, an unreadable emotion on his face. Before I knew what was happening, I was sprinting out the back door, followed by the echos of the second gunshot of him taking his own life. 

Suddenly, I heard SPECTR’s voice again, but it sounded garbled, distant through the pounding in my ears. 

My body was moving on its own, guided by a force I couldn’t control. When I finally felt I was far enough, I looked back to see the house dissolve into nothingness. 

Panic surged through me as the world around me buckled, and the ground beneath my feet shifted like quicksand.

I snapped my eyes shut, fighting against the rising tide of fear, but the taste of adrenaline lingered on my tongue, bitter and metallic.

I opened my eyes, suddenly on my side. I lay next to the pod, now shattered. I must have hit my head on the descent. I stayed there for a moment, surrounded by the soft, swaying grass. I took long deep breaths, calming myself, then stood up and brushed myself off. My mind was swimming, doing my best to convince myself it was just a dream. "I have to complete the mission," I said to myself, hoping to hype myself up. "I got this. I trained for this." I took a moment to gather myself, then reluctantly set off into the flora to scan the surface. 

-

The air on this planet was thick and hot, like a breath, pressing against me as I took each step. My boots sank into the soft ground, the rich, purple soil clinging to the soles like it wanted to hold me here. The sky above shimmered in unnatural hues of red and orange, swirling like liquid fire.

I had been walking for hours now. Or maybe days? Time felt like it was bending and stretching, like it couldn’t quite keep up with the world around me. My mind kept returning to the look on my father's face. Almost like rage. Shaking it off, I realized I must have seen that tree before...

"Commander, the planet's atmosphere is fluctuating. Biometric feedback indicates significant psychological stress. Recommend returning to base."

I ignored the warning, pushing forward. I needed to keep going. I had to finish the mission.

But the planet wasn’t letting me move easily. My steps began to feel heavier, like the ground itself was trying to pull me down. Then, a sound—that low hum—reached my ears, vibrating through my chest. It was faint at first, but as I walked deeper into the alien landscape, it grew louder. It felt like the planet was watching me, studying me. I felt a throbbing in my head. 

Ahead, something caught my eye—a figure, laying still among the pulsating greenery.

It was a man. His back turned to me, but his frame was unmistakable. My stomach dropped. It couldn’t be.

“...Marcus?” I whispered, my voice hoarse.

I remember that night so clearly. The apartment was dim, the silence thick. I found him like this—pale, barely breathing, his lips tinged blue from the overdose. His eyes, glazed and empty. He didn’t even recognize me.

 I did what I could, or at least I thought I did. I tried to call for help, but it was too late. I was there when they took him to the hospital. I was there when they announced the time of death. I was at the damn funeral. 

Yet here he was. On the ground in front of me. Hundreds of thousands of light-years away from home. 

He didn’t move. But the feeling inside me twisted into something sharp, something dangerous.

No. Not this. Not now.

I walked toward him, each step more reluctant than the last. But the planet seemed to urge me forward, pulling me closer, as if I didn’t have a choice.

As I closed the distance, I could see him more clearly—Marcus, my best friend. His body was unnaturally still, his face pale. I froze, the world tilting sideways. My mind screamed for me to stop, but my body continued on its own, guided by something I couldn’t fight.

"Marcus! Please—" The words caught in my throat.

I dropped to my knees beside him, my heart pounding, the adrenaline already surging through my veins. He was cold. His skin felt clammy under my fingertips as I desperately pressed my hand to his chest.

No, no, no, no. Not this again.

"Marcus, stay with me," I choked out, but his body didn’t move. His eyes stayed shut. He was gone. I could feel the familiar panic bubbling up inside me. The knot in my stomach tightened. The adrenaline surged harder, and the planet started to vibrate.

I looked around, trying to shake the reality that was creeping in. This planet. It felt... alive. I could feel its pulse below me, its rhythm. It was responding to me. feeding on me.

"Come on, man," I whispered, my voice breaking as I shook him, but nothing. He didn’t respond.

I was shaking now. The adrenaline was almost overwhelming. My vision swam as everything around me shifted. The once vibrant trees warped into darker shapes, twisting and creeping toward me, as if they were closing in.

Then, his eyes opened.

I gasped. But they weren’t the same. They were hollow, empty. His mouth moved but no words came out.

"You let me die," he whispered, his voice a rasp, distant. A hollow sound that seemed to reverberate in the very air around us.

My heart skipped a beat. “No, no, no...” I stammered, my mind racing. I couldn’t breathe. I did everything I could!

But the memory—the weight of that guilt—flooded me like a tidal wave. The shame. The helplessness. The fear. I could feel my heartbeat in every part of my body, surrounding me like a body of water.  Every pulse of adrenaline I produced made the air thicker, the landscape more distorted. The ground pulsed and buzzed.

I backed away, scrambling to my feet, but the world around me kept warping. The ground beneath me trembled, and the sky flickered with strange patterns, like the planet was alive, breathing with me, feeding on the chaos I was creating inside my own mind.

“No... this is wrong...” My voice cracked.

The ground beneath me cracked open, dark tendrils of the earth reaching for me. The trees—no, they were no longer trees—moved like serpents, their twisted forms closing in around me, forcing me to run.

But every step I took, I felt the world shifting again. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. I was still standing in the same spot. But the planet... the planet had done something to my mind.

"SPECTR, what’s happening?!" I shouted, but my voice was swallowed by the unnatural hum that pulsed through the air.

"Commander, your vitals are dangerously elevated. I strongly advise returning to the pod immediately."

I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. The adrenaline was consuming me, driving me forward, pushing me deeper into the illusion the planet had created.

I stumbled over uneven ground, the world around me blurring into flashes of color and darkness. The memory of Marcus — of finding him, lifeless — gripped me with a force I couldn’t escape. 

Then, something cracked in the distance, sharp and deafening, like the sound of breaking glass.

It all stopped.

Everything went still. I looked around, and felt sick to my stomach.

"What the hell...?" I was right back where I started. Back at the pod. The tightness around my skull was getting unbearable. Disoriented, I stood, trying once again to gather my bearings. 

My heart hammered in my chest, the adrenaline almost unbearable. The hum of the planet vanished, leaving nothing but silence. I fell to my knees, gasping for breath, my hands trembling.

"What... what is this..." 

Once again, I took off into the overgrowth, desperate to understand what was happening to me. Every time, I ran into one of my worst memories. Every time, I ended up right back where I started. But I couldn't keep myself from perpetuating this fucked up cycle. It was like I wasn't in control anymore. 

/////////////////

"SPECTR, status report on Quill."

Davis sat anxiously awaiting for the answer. It's been months since the send-off. There should have been some kind of communications by now. 

"Commander Callum Quill," SPECTR chirped in reply. 

"Status Report: Deceased. Individual in question has been confirmed deceased following a period of 37 days comatose. Cause of death has been determined to be cardiac arrest. Further details are available upon request"

Davis gripped the edge of the console, his breath shallow as the words settled in. He couldn’t stop the weight of them from crashing down. Quill was gone. Gone, and there was nothing he could do.

“Further details, SPECTR,” Davis whispered, his voice hoarse. His fingers hovered over the keys, but he didn’t want to see the rest. Not really.

The artificial intelligence responded, its voice almost clinical. “Details: Commander Quill's vital signs exhibited extreme physical distress. Elevated cortisol levels, rapid heart rate, and irregular brain wave patterns were detected during the last recorded hours of life. The data suggests external stimuli influencing these anomalies.”

Davis closed his eyes. He rubbed his face, the bitterness of failure thick on his tongue. “What happened to his body? Where is it now?”

“Commander Quill’s remains are unable to be located at this time,” SPECTR replied, unaffected by the grief hanging in Davis’s words.

A long silence stretched between them. There was no going back. Quill was gone, his mind lost to the planet’s hunger. But Davis couldn’t shake the sense that there was something more to this. And if there was any way of discovering what it was, of avenging his friend, Davis would be the one to do it. He glanced at the map of the distant planet on the monitor.

Maybe there was a way.
