I left the cult I was involved with a long time ago, however it’s teachings still stay with me always. I have been a member here for quite some time, lurking in the shadows, reading and finding comfort in your experiences as they relate to my own. Even if I have never commented or messaged you personally, I have felt a strong kinship here with you. I have seen many inspiring things on this forum and have decided that now is the time for me to share my own experience, with hope it can inspire others.

Before I begin, it is important to remember that perception is reality. How you are raised shapes so much of who you are, and the way you view the world. Seeing as this is a forum for people like me, I may not need to explain that. However, I am very used to explaining it to outsiders, and it is a good reminder to us all. You never know what someone else has gone through.

I won’t bore you with my entire childhood, but instead will impart to you the events that led to me leaving my village and brought me here. The events that reshaped my beliefs and made me who I am today.

I am leaving for a trip tomorrow night and will attempt to get everything out to you before I do. If not tonight then tomorrow morning so please be patient if I cannot get through the full story all at once.

Before I begin, I just want to make clear to you all this simple message.

You can leave. You can change. You CAN be your best self.

My name is Vilina, and this is my story.







**Part I**



As the willows whispered wildly, I passed under and through them. With their many fingers passing over me they brought an already steady girlish giggle to a hearty laugh. I knew that my sisters were not far behind, but as sure as a siren’s call they could always find me from my laughter.

I traveled through the far meadows to the edge of the marsh. I rolled down the ocean of tall grasses and stopped face up at the bank. Looking skyward and feeling the warm winds whip against my cheek, I lounged daydreaming up at the clouds.

My dreams, much like the rest of my childhood, had always been so calm and comforting. They were so vibrant in their peace and serenity that at times I longed to sleep, to rejoin that other worldly place and its many dreamscapes. I had often thought about it before, and have often since, how fascinating it is that in dreams you do not necessarily see things. It is more a feeling you get from your dream, and your mind simply generates images to match. You get the feeling of falling, or of something chasing you, and that gives you the images of coming closer to earth, or of a monster. Nightmares.

I did not have nightmares. Like most children, other girls in the village did have nightmares. Nightmares were explained to me, but I did not have terrors to call my own. My dreams seemed constantly filled with ethereal places of heavenly, bright vivid visages of wanderlust brought on by a constant sense of tranquility.

I had always dreamed this way, until I didn’t. What’s strange is that in those final weeks in the village my dreams had changed, but at the same time they had not. Where I once dreamed of my wind-swept oceans of tall grasses feeding into mountains and meadows, I now saw only the same things every time I closed my eyes. I saw things I had never seen before. Things that contrasted so harshly to all I had ever known.

In those dreams I saw cold dark earth packed against red stone walls. I saw a mother who had hair about her face. Mostly, I saw the well. Other images came and went through my dreams in those last few weeks, but the one constant was the well. A well with black brackish waters in a dark place. Always dark. The well with waters that would move up and over you as they slowly transcended upwards out of the well in small beads, sweating from the surface. I remember the feeling that these small perspirations were at the same time calling to me as they were comforting me. They hungered for me to touch them. In every dream I approached the well, but I never touched it or its waters. Whenever I awoke from these dreams, I remember feeling so odd. Not from the dreams themselves, but from the feelings they gave me. These things when said out loud to Mother should have been frightening. So foreign and dark to the only world I had ever known; and yet somehow, I felt the same comfort as I had when traversing my normal temples of trees and green vistas. Maybe for the same reasons I have heard people love to watch wild horses, I loved the well dream. The thing I could not control. The thing I wanted to know more about that always evaded me.

My mother did not have much to say about these dreams. She merely brushed them off and told me it was a normal part of growing older. We couldn’t always dream of the meadows.

On that day, as I laid on the beach of the marshland beyond, I slipped again into that same dream, and dreamt as I often had in those weeks. I dreamt of the well, and of its waters calling out to me once more. I approached closer than I ever had before. I willed myself to reach out and touch the bubbly baubles. To  run and to leap into those waters. Yet in my dream, my slow approach never faltered as I drew steadily closer to the well. I felt myself coming to a precipice, about to finally understand what it meant in some way to learn its secrets. I saw my hand climb from my side and stretch out to the surface, coming close to peering over the edge. As I reached the climax of the dream, ready to view the depths of the pool, I felt myself lurch from my slumber once more, its secrets escaping me.

“Vilina! Wake up!”

I jolted from the dream. My sister Blanche’s pale face stared down at me with disapproving eyes.

The wind carried her golden hair across her face, which she primly swept and placed neatly back in order as I sat up.

“Asleep again? Always asleep,” she scolded.

“I was so close! So close to knowing! I could feel it!” I said without veiling my exasperation.

“So close to nothing,” she chided.

“Its just a dream. We all have the dream. The mothers say we all get them as we get older,” she spoke factually and without condescension.

I knew Blanche did not approve of my many trips through the forests, or of my general curious and lackadaisical habits. However, being perfect as she was, it was not in her to be snide or rude. She had never shared her own feelings on the matter, or of my actions.

“Blanche is right you know,” said Agnes.

I looked to see Agnes staring off towards the marsh with the same look of mistrust and concern she gave most things.

“We all have the dreams. Mother says even if they terrify us there is nothing to fear,” she continued, her head tilted as she more carefully inspected a frog hopping off into the murk with a little more disgust.

Luckily for Agnes, at that moment we all turned as we heard the beginning of the call. The afternoon beginning of the chapel services, and the melodic hum traveling across the valley to all corners.

Blanche sighed, no doubt anxiously awaiting her eventual visit through those doors and an end to the longing. Longing for the communion with Him she had long been promised. She stared off in the direction of the village, lingering just a second before regaining her composure.

“We are all too old for this sort of prattle. Any day now we will have our descendance,” said Blanche. “We will meet Him and see the world beyond. We are far too old to be concerned with dreams and fears. The only thing we need be concerned with is how best to serve Him in all ways and uphold the faith as Mother always says.”

Placing her hands on her knees, she sat perfectly poised for a moment before softening her face with a smile and looked down to me.

I was amazed at the way she harnessed the ability to preach at us while always maintaining her calm, sweet, motherly demeanor. It was as if she was perpetually practicing the balance, to slip into the perfect motherly role she was destined for. If nothing else could be said, we could all know that Blanche wanted nothing more than to be a mother herself and raise a daughter of her own.

She saw me staring up at her, pondering the thought while laying lazily in the sand. I’m sure I had a look of indifference to the sermon.

Mother or not, she looked at me rolling her eyes as she spoke.

“Come now, lets get back before service finishes to help with the end of day chores.”

Standing, she held out her hand to me.

It was my turn to roll my eyes as I took her hand and she helped me to my feet.

Her face turned to confusion as our eyes met, and she looked down.

She turned my hand over and I saw her eyes widen.

I looked down to see what alarmed her, and took in the sight of my own palm. There was dried blood mixed with the sand sticking to a fresh cut.

Before I could even react, she was dragging me to the waters edge. She began vigorously rinsing my hand in the cold murky waters.

Anges yelped at the sight.

“You… You can’t do that. You can’t do that. We don’t touch the marsh. We don’t touch the marsh. You know that! WE DO NOT TOUCH THE MARSH!” 

Anges was working herself into a frenzy.

Blanche’s eyes were wide with panic; however, her voice was still as the waters had been before our interruption.

“We have to clean it. Maybe, if we clean it there wont be a cut. Maybe you just put your hand in something,” she said. 

Frantically she went on waving my hand in the waters.

I already knew she was wrong. I must have gotten the cut while rolling down the bank, but even now I don’t remember feeling when it happened. I do however, remember the sting I felt as the waters of the marsh entered my hand. These were not the tranquil calling waters of the well. These were fresh embers, the burning felt from the cold liquid sent a small prickle up my wrist, and I pulled away from her.

“Let me see it!”, she called as I walked back up the bank.

"The water. The boundaries. You both know the rules. The marsh and the valley apex. It is forbidden. You both know. You know this." Agnes was spiraling, dwindling out. She knelt on the ground. She still had not moved an inch closer to the marsh or toward us. Dejectedly she repeatedly whispered as she stared at the ground, "You know… You know…"

The gash was a couple inches across my palm. Given it had been some time since it happened, with Blanche's cleaning it wasn't even bleeding anymore.

"Let me see it, I said!", came Blanche, grasping for my hand once more.

I pulled away again to face her.

"I am fine. Its fine!"

"It’s not fine Vilina! You know it’s not fine, the desce…"

"IT. IS. FINE!”, I yelled. Taking a breath, I straightened. “You sound like her."

I pointed at Agnes who sat still mumbling, now too low to hear.

"SHE. IS. RIGHT!" screamed Blanche emphatically, finally losing the cool poise of the perfect promised child. "I know she's right, and so do you. We don’t touch the marsh, or go beyond the boundary of the valley's apex. Exiting or going beyond the boundaries before descendance is forbidden. We all know this. You also cannot damage yourself. I only want to help you. We need to find a way to fix this. To hide it if we must.”

There was a part of me that was touched by her act to help save me. At the same time I thought about how much of that may be self-preservation. We were meant to be three pure sisters descending as a trio, as He wished.

My eyes narrowed.

"This is hardly my first scrape, let alone on my hands."

I pulled up my skirts to show the pale lines and years of healed damage. My arms were much the same. I had been lucky that my hands had never seemed to be harmed. Added to the fact that injuries were easily concealed in a world where Mothers did not scan over every inch of you. We all wore the white linens from wrist to ankle. People were more inclined to believe you just caught your dress on a snag than you had been injured, so long as you cleaned the fabric well before arriving back home. I had become excellent at cleaning and mending by this point.

This also wasn't my first time in the marsh. I had spent many a clandestine afternoon wading through the wetlands and sunbathing on the further bank when I knew no one was looking for me. I treasured my stolen afternoons while Blanche devoted more time to housework, and Agnes to fetching up her mother’s skirts. However, I chose not kick that hornet’s nest.

"I just don't see why He would care at all about a few scrapes over the years, Blanche. Why would He care?"

Blanche's mouth dropped.

"We are all meant to come to him as pure as we were born. That is His will. How could you be so careless with all of our futures?", she said flatly.

"Because it doesn't matter."

You would think my words had been a knife to her belly.

"These rules. They are just words. I did worry once, about the first small knick I received. Then nothing happened. As I grew older, I realized no one checks me. No one cares. It does not matter, Blanche."

I don't know if she even heard my second reply, as she still seemed to be recovering from the first time I told her it did not matter.

“What of the Mother’s cuts? What of their hands? He seems fine with that.”

She swallowed back whatever disgust she had at my admissions and admonishments.

"I sincerely hope you're right, Vilina. I hope you don't come to regret this when you meet Him. I hope we all don't come to regret it," she said, choosing to ignore my comments about the mothers hands. We all knew not to speak of them.

She took a breath, and then I saw something change in her for a moment. Something passed the preachy perfect sister I had always known. Her eyes read hurt.

"I do wish you would have told me. I would have told you."

As quickly as the hurt had shown, it was gone. She dusted off her dress and looked at Agnes. She spoke kind and stern as always, ever the mother again.

"Come now Agnes, you will be okay. One way or another we must not speak of this. What is done is done. We have not done wrong and have to pray He will know our piety above all when we are weighed and judged by Him. In the end, all are to serve His will, not our own."

This last jab she threw hit home at that moment. She knew it would sting, as those words were not just spoken out of anger. The words were my mother’s words, spoken to me many times through the years. No matter how many times I strayed the path, they had not stopped me from myself. Hearing my mothers own counsel, I wasn't just letting Him down, I was letting Mother down.

Blanche walked up and over the bank holding Agnes’ hand. They headed back through the forest guided by the rising rhythmic hum of His call.

They were easy words for Blanche to say as an attempt to hurt me, but what did she know? She had never known anything beyond her teachings. She had never felt the call of the wild as I had, never felt the pull from the peaks around us. Blanche had never longed for more than she was allowed. She never hoped for more.

Strengthened in my resolve, I picked myself up and made haste, determined to catch up with my sisters on the path back to the village. 

I caught up to them at the foot of the forest that acted as barrier to the meadows. We did not talk of my hand, or of the marsh again. 

As we wound through the path we talked of chores. As always, I found it difficult to focus on turning in the animals, washing, candle lighting, dinner preparation, etc. I did my best to act excited to gather the eggs and clean our chicken coup, though I hated the thought. The hens always pecked at me as I nimbly inspected their nests for eggs. Not to mention the feeling of fear I felt at the thought of running into Stosh. I didn’t have anything that made me feel fear like the other girls did from their dreams, but if I did have nightmares it would surely have been from that rooster.

I shook off the thought, and put on a smile as we weaved through the woods. At last we reached the point of the forest that began to thin, the trees making way for grasses and then nothing but dirt with pink and white pedals.

The apex of the valley was marked all around us by large flowering dogwood. In the spring each year they started to drop their blossoms. The petals rode the wind to bless us with their spectacle each year, a welcome reminder of just how much I loved home. If the wilds were the waves of my daydreams, then the village was my port. A place to always return, rest, and repeat.

For some reason the grass and forest refused to overtake the village. I never saw anyone have to clear or remove the woods to make way for new homes, or pens. However, the petals never seemed to care and always blessed us with their beauty. A light dusting always covered the ground through summer, offering a carpet of color to brighten the many dirt pathways and thatched rooftops of the hundreds of small dwellings within the village.

As we crossed the threshold of the village we saw the other girls already hurrying about their nightly chores. We wound through the homes, and passed by Kori, Reina, and Gabriel. Reina and Blanche had a long standing unspoken feud, the most awkward standoff that I had ever seen. It was a battle for supremacy, to determine who could be more ideal. It was odd, because they did not openly dislike each other.

We all walked the same path in opposite directions, two sets of three sisters. We met abruptly, staring at one another. We let the two saintly sally’s do the talking.

“Blanche,” said Reina, bobbing her head slowly in acknowledgment.

“Reina,” said Blanche, mimicking her to perfection.

The two prefects stood at attention, mirroring each other in every way down to their golden hair and clasped hands at their navels.

“We are off to prepare for our Mother’s dinner before we receive His word,” said Reina.

“We are off to do much the same, except we also plan to bed the animals and get a head start on tomorrows chores. Sorry, we can’t stay to chat. We had better hurry off, mustn’t waste the remainder of the chapel services. As He wills, we look to the future.”

I looked at Blanche with a groan. We never discussed getting a head start on tomorrows work. I for one would not have been in favor, but I did my best to say nothing. I didn't need any more sermons tonight.

Blanche’s comment made Reina’s eye twitch ever so slightly, interrupting the staring contest, and like that it was over.

“May your descent come soon, and may you all be found worthy,” they both said in unison. The three girls parted way for us, and we walked past them nodding to each other as we did.

I picked up my skirts as Blanche quickened her pace. She strode with her long legs, and the harmony of quick deliberate motion coupled with upright rigidness gave her a weightless quality. Floating, she moved ahead of us with a grace we could not match.

Agnes, seemed always ready for the way that Blanche moved with purpose throughout the village. Trusting Blanche to be her eyes, she kept hers to the ground looking for the imperceivable threats looming to make her take a tumble as she flew.

“I can’t stand that girl,” I breathed, as soon as we turned a corner.

“You ought not to speak like that about anyone, Vilina,” Blanche said.

“I know you hate her too. All of her comments about hoping we descend soon! She might as well just say she wants to be rid of us already.”

“It’s just a nice thing to say,” said Agnes with a sigh.

“I see what she is really saying, and you both know it’s true,” I spat at the ground. I also couldn't afford to look up at this point, with this pace.

“I for one am not trying to say that I hope they descend soon to be rid of her. It is simply the proper thing to say,” said Blanche, as she came to a stop.

Agnes and I almost toppled as we slid to a halt and bumped into one another. Looking up I saw why Blanche had stopped. We were at the point in our route that took us closest to the chapel. I could see the plainly colored white wood boards that made up its walls, otherwise unadorned. My eyes traveled over the great double doors beyond the stairs that Blanche daydreamed of climbing one day. The doors were bathed in a green light, the only such light in all of the village. When I thought about this building I really only had three questions. What made that light green? What was beyond the doors that made the chapel forbidden to girls and not mothers? I pondered the third question, as my eyes raised to look at the chimney above the steepled roof. There was the same steady stream of smoke rising from the chimney that never seemed to cease no matter the time of day or the weather. Blanche turned back to me.

“I am not trying to say that I hope she descends soon to be rid of her,” she repeated. “I do hope she descends soon. Just not before me.” She smiled a smile that touched her eyes before redoubling the mad pace from before.

Agnes and I sighed and took off at a run after her. She may have been able to keep that pace without running or looking foolish, but I am sure Agnes and I looked like idiots.

We came to our home at last. Without speaking, we all went our separate ways and made for the chores previously discussed.

Agnes broke for the washing, and Blanche for the cooking. I ran straight for the hen pen, but as soon as I was around the back of the house I stopped running and took in a deep breath.

Sitting still, tall, and proud was Stosh. With all two feet of his mustered height, the rooster crowed defiantly.

“His will,” I said with a sigh. I walked forward into battle.

Thirty minutes later and a few additional snags in my linens, I returned to the house carrying the nightly round of eggs. I almost dropped the delivery when I saw all three mothers already home.

Agnes sat wide eyed in a chair near Mother Ailsa, who seemed to be speaking slowly to calm her. Blanche was hugging Mother Beatrice. She overflowed with joyful laughter while trying her best to maintain a semblance of grace.

I was confused, until my own mother stood from a chair next to the door. Mother Genevieve looked to me and said what I should have known already.

“My child, your time has come. Tomorrow will be the day of your descendance.” 

I did not react as my sisters did. Agnes responded in fear, Blanche in joy, but I did not know how to feel. I searched my thoughts, and couldn’t determine where I stood between the two. The concept just seemed foreign. Sure, one day I would descend; but that was “some day”. Now that “some day” was tomorrow, I felt torn. Mother Genevieve must have seen the look of consternation. She came to forward, wrapping her arms around me in an embrace. She pulled my head close to her chest, her long stark white hair encasing me.

“I am so proud of you my daughter,” she whispered softly. Her words were a gift just for me. She gently patted my back with one hand, the other stroking my hair delicately. 

I pulled back just enough to look up into her wise old eyes.

“I hope I can make you proud tomorrow,” I said.

I meant it. I hoped I would be able to descend. With the reality of the day settling in, I remembered that my fate was not only tied to my sisters, but also to Mother. I was an extension of her, after all.

“You will. I know you will,” she said with a soft, warm smile.

She went to hug me again, and as she did I saw past her. I took in the scene of my sisters different emotional states.

By now, Blanche had moved to comforting Agnes with Mother Ailsa. Mother Beatrice stood with hands on hips, a monument to rigid impatience. She looked in my direction with that same look she had given me my entire life. Unbridled, exasperated contemptuousness lit in her eyes.

“One of them cries. The other looks like a lost fawn!”, she said throwing her hands in the air. “We have spent their entire lives preparing them for this moment. You would think there would be more gratitude. In His name. I told you both that you have been to lax with these two. Especially this one,” she said pointing at me.

It would only serve that the Mother who had raised excellency would have high standards, but Mother Beatrice took this to a different plane. Needless to say as a girl who wasn’t known for following His teachings quite so strictly, I was always a target for a good sermon. Or condemnation.

“We all handle the descendence in our own way, Beatrice,” said Genevieve.

“This one hasn't handled anything, ever,” she returned flatly.

“I think she is handling it just fine. We never know when our day will come, or what His will is until He shows us,” my mother said, now turning and giving that same soft smile to Beatrice.

I loved it when she preached lightly back to her. This wasn’t just another set of sisters we watched wrapped in a contended battle of devotion as before. No, this was two titans of divinity.

Acting unfazed, Beatrice approached.

“The trio must serve their purpose as one. If she does not do her part, this will all have been for nothing.”

“She will be fine. As will sweet Agnes,” said Genevieve, gracing the timid girl with a nod of approval.

“They will go. They will descend as He wills, one way or another it will be done,” said Ailsa quietly as she stood. She spread the creases from her linens with far more creased and crevassed fingers.

This was unlike her. Each mother had a different way of dealing with things. My own mother had a philosophy of fighting Beatrice’s icy demeanor with warmth and an occasional spark of flame. Agnes’ mother chose to handle her with a casual nonchalance, like she did all things. More often then not, just choosing to let her cold stare drill into her uncaring face.

Ailsa let out a long, deep breath and walked from the room with a slow tired gait. She made clear she had nothing more to say or add. Her silence carried enough weight of its own.

Agnes looked like a fish out of water. Looking around in dismay, she stood quickly.

“Goodnight sisters. Goodnight mothers,” she said quickly. She almost tripped on her dress as she tried to curtsy while turning to leave in pursuit of her mother.

Even Blanche’s mother seemed stunned to see Ailsa partake in the discussion at all with such finality. However, that shock did not last long. She shook it off quickly and restored her fury to me.

“She better make it Genevieve. Blanche deserves better,” she fumed. She called for Blanche to accompany her, and stormed off.

Blanche hurried to follow, but not before giving me an apologetic look.

“Goodnight Sister. Goodnight Mother Genevieve. Thank you for all you have done for me. For all of us,” she said. I could tell she was still overjoyed and despite the heated exchange she still couldn't set aside her own excitement for the next days events.

She curtsied her respect, and quickly padded off to follow her mother.

We took our leave then, and as usual Mother walked me to my room. Like every other night, as I prepared my night clothes she sat at the edge of my bed humming quietly. Mother closed her eyes as she swayed there to that melody. It was as though she drifted off in her own special place. It is a memory I still take with me always. Something to comfort me to sleep each night, even now.

“Are you nervous my child?”, she asked as I slipped into bed.

“I am. I just want to satisfy Him.” I lied.

“You will Vilina. You will. I have faith.”

“What will happen tomorrow, Mother?”, I asked.

She paused looking down at me as her lips pulled to a line. She looked even older than usual. It was as if the smile vanishing on my kindly mothers face was a sign that all of the exuberance she had left had been depleted, leaving a husk of the sweet fruit she had been.

“You know I cannot tell you that,” she said. Her tender look and smile returned, but it seemed to take some effort or unknown toll from her.

“What if I don’t know what to do? What happens if I make a mess of things? I don’t want to ruin things, or to disappoint you.”

She maintained her patient kindness, but I could tell somewhere behind that smile something was troubling her. She chewed my words. Nodding to herself she seemed to come to a decision.

“My daughter, my Lamb. I must confess that no other Mother has ever truly loved a daughter as I do so love you, my child.”

She paused a moment. Her eyes took me in, and then looked about the room as if to just take in the moment. Seeing no one else, she took a deep breath and whispered to me. She spoke in a rush, in a tone that not even the walls were meant to hear.

“Because of the depth of my love for you Vilina, I must tell you something. Something that I should not.”

My head cocked to the side, but before I could speak, Mother Genevieve leaned in closely. Even though she was whispering directly into my ear, her voice was so hushed I thought even the light wind outside would surely take the words away.

“In the most difficult moments.

Take heed my words.

Give in completely.

Have faith forever my child.”

She pushed out each line quickly like a spear which attacked my mind the moment it left her and entered me. As quickly as the conspiratorial possession overtook her, it seemed to pass as she pulled away and stood. She once again spoke busily of mundane nightly duties.

“Are you hungry?”, she said.

I was still reeling trying to understand.

“I shall fetch you something small before bed.”

She walked out of the room. I was left in the vacuum created in the wake of her words, words that ran rampant through my head. Spinning, I replayed every line.

“In the most difficult moments.

Take heed my words.

Give in completely.

Have faith forever my child.”

What made this odd was that there was nothing out of the ordinary in anything she said.

Nothing made sense, because it all made too much sense. She had told me these things almost daily for my entire life.

I had always been a wanderer. It was difficult for me to fall in line. Difficult to conform to the dresses, chores, routines, and rituals that all the other girls seemed to have no issue adhering to. Because of this, Mother had often told me to heed her words, to give in to Him, be forever in faith, and to follow His will. She had even said this in front of my sisters and the other mothers many, many times. These things were openly taught; not just to me, but to all of us during the many seasons of life.

We were always meant to have faith in His teachings, even though as girls we did not yet know Him. Every girl in the village knew that during difficult winters, pain, or any hardship, our mothers faith was strong. We never lost faith in them, and our mothers never lost faith in Him.

Why would she say such a thing, and in such a way? The question plagued me.

She returned to my bed with a small portion of bread and cheese. Handing it to me I could tell that she knew I was vexed. However, along with all other great conspirators, we held a commonality. The unspoken trust that what had been said, had been said quietly and in such a way as to never be mentioned again.

She sat humming a version of the call at the edge of my bed while I ate. It was my turn to take in that moment now. Seeing her there, I ate slowly. I hoped she would say something else to make it all make sense, but in the end I finished my plate and handed it back to her. She stood, kissed my forehead, and smiled at me one last time before leaving the room without another word.

I laid awake mulling the meaning of Mothers words repeatedly until His real nightly call came crashing through the village. The low thrum of the tone reverberated in the small space. The walls shook and my bed pulsed as it lulled me to sleep. In my slumber I floated off to be filled with more dark, moist memories.
