  Years ago I started doing cardio on the daily, going on runs and walks . Come a few years later I would not have time to run during the day, so I started running at night . What I didn't know Is that that would be my biggest mistake.

 I first started noticing it about 7 months ago when I would drive past there would be tapping on my car,and  with the occasional urge to go into the woods, It got stanger over time,I would hear voices calling to me from the woods, It sounded like someone was whistling from the dark abyss of the forest calling me in , and I Eventually went into the woods because I couldn't resist anymore. While in the woods it felt awfully too quiet even for night, there were no crickets,frogs,or bats. As I was walking around I spotted something with my light. It was hard to make out what it was ,but at that moment I knew something was horribly wrong.. 

  Whatever it was gave me an intense feeling of doom, it seemed to stare into my soul, and It knew. Every thought in my head, because as soon as i thought to run It started screaming and stood up.  I ran towards an old decrepit shed and barricaded myself in with whatever I could. There was a window in the shed that I could see out of and I could see the creature running around me. I was horrified as it let out a scream in sheer fury that it could not get to me , it was ramming into the door and I knew it wouldn't hold much longer . I had to find a way out of the window without drawing attention.
 
  I noticed the window was not properly installed,If I was careful enough I could dislodge it but I had do be quick or It would be my death, and it would be an excruciating death at that. Its presence was that of hell itself,I got a glimpse of the creature and it was instantly burned into my brain its eyes were white its ski was rotting away and you could see its bones,it was malformed its joins were going the wrong way, the creature had teeth that were awful too sharp, most likely used to easily tear flesh from its prey. It smelled like sulfur and dead animals.

  In the corner of the shed I found a chunk of lumber which I used to push out the window by pushing on the frame of the window with the board and my foot. And the window fell outside of the shed into the leaves ,luckily making minimal noise.
  I climb through the hole that leads outside and I can see it scratching through the door, what i didn't realize is how keen its sense of smell was ,because it knew i wasn't inside the shed anymore and it stopped trying to get in and started looking around , all I could do was pray that it wouldn't spot me , it eventually gave up and went the other way. I noticed it was getting lighter outside as morning approached, and I had hope of getting out to safety until I accidentally stepped on a small rabbit , I knew then that I wouldn't see daylight ever again. The rabbit let out a sharp cry and I could hear the creature bounding towards me ,I felt static run through my entire body as I knew death was imminent . The last thing I heard before its claws slashed through my skin was a blood curdling scream that pierced through my soul.
