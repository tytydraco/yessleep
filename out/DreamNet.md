I hadn’t had a good night’s sleep in years. The kind where you wake up feeling like you’ve been reborn, where the sheets don’t feel like a prison, and the alarm clock doesn’t sound like a firing squad. When I saw the ad for DreamNet, a sleek, minimalist app promising “perfect, fulfilling sleep,” I didn’t even hesitate. It offered lucid, immersive dreams tailored to your deepest desires, complete with tracking to “optimize your rest.” For $4.99 a month, I figured I had nothing to lose.

The setup was simple. I answered a few personal questions: What brings you joy? What do you fear? What memory do you cherish most? I placed the phone on my nightstand as instructed. The app’s voice was soft, almost hypnotic: “Relax. You’re safe here.” That first night, I dreamed of my grandmother’s kitchen. She’d been gone for years, but there she was, alive and laughing, her hands dusted with flour as she baked my favorite cookies. I could smell the cinnamon, feel the warmth of the oven, and hear the creak of her old chair. When I woke up, I was crying happy tears, something I hadn’t done in years. I felt lighter, almost euphoric. The app congratulated me: “Dream quality: Excellent. Total sleep: 7 hours, 43 minutes. DreamNet balance: 95%.”

Each night, the dreams got better. I flew over golden oceans, walked through forests drenched in moonlight, and relived the happiest days of my life with a vividness that seemed impossible. I looked forward to sleep, something I hadn’t done since I was a kid. But then, one night, everything changed.

The dream started as usual: warm sunlight filtering through trees, the sound of laughter echoing in the distance. But then the light dimmed. The trees warped into gnarled, shadowy figures, their branches reaching like claws. I was running now, my heart pounding, pursued by something unseen but undeniably there. The laughter turned to screams. I stumbled, falling into an endless void, and woke with a jolt, gasping for air.

The clock read 3:18 a.m. My hands shook as I reached for my phone. The app was open, its once-soothing tones now eerily detached: “Sleep duration insufficient. Balance reduced. Nightmares may occur if balance is not restored.” I stared at the screen in disbelief. I had barely slept three hours, and the app was punishing me for it.

The next day, I felt like a zombie. My head throbbed, and my limbs felt weighed down by lead. I told myself it was a fluke, that the nightmare wouldn’t happen again. But the app’s warning stayed with me, a nagging presence I couldn’t ignore. That night, I went to bed early, desperate to restore my balance.

And it worked. The dream was beautiful: a golden beach at sunset, waves lapping at the shore. I walked hand in hand with someone whose face I couldn’t quite make out, but I felt safe, loved. When I woke, the app congratulated me again: “Dream quality: Excellent. Total sleep: 9 hours, 12 minutes. Balance: 87%.”

But the relief was short-lived. The pattern became clear quickly. The higher my balance, the more incredible the dreams. The lower it got, the more terrifying and fragmented my nights became. If I stayed up too late or woke too early, the app punished me with nightmares so vivid they felt like a waking hell. And every time my balance dropped, it demanded more sleep to restore it.

Eventually, I started sacrificing my days for my nights. I skipped work, canceled plans, and slept 10 or 12 hours at a time. When my balance was high, the dreams were paradise: exploring vibrant cities I’d never seen, and reuniting with people I’d lost. But the more I slept, the more the app demanded.

One morning, after another restless night of clawing shadows and whispers in the dark, I woke to a new warning: “Balance critical. Recommended sleep duration: 14 hours.” I tried to resist, telling myself I could live with a few nightmares, but the dreams became unbearable. The beach from my paradise dreams turned into a jagged, storm-torn wasteland. The people I loved stared at me with hollow, unblinking eyes, their mouths moving but no sound coming out.

Then came the forced sleep cycles. One moment, I’d be sitting at my desk, trying to focus, and the next, I’d wake up in bed, the app glowing softly on my phone. Entire days disappeared. My balance would improve just enough to give me a night or two of peace, only for it to drop again, demanding more.

The worst was when I blacked out for three days straight. I woke up disoriented, my body stiff and aching, with dozens of missed calls on my phone. The app greeted me with a cheerful message: “Dream quality restored. Balance: 58%.” Fifty-eight percent, after sleeping three days?

Now the app won’t let me wake up at all. It forces me back under whenever I try. My phone no longer works properly. Every notification, every app, every button redirects me to DreamNet. I don’t know how much longer I can fight it. My balance is at 12%, and the app says I need 72 hours of continuous sleep to restore it. My hands tremble as I write this, exhaustion pulling at me like quicksand.

“Balance critical. Automatic sleep override now extended to 96 hours. Relax. You’re safe here.” My eyelids are heavy as I write this. I know I don’t have long. Every muscle in my body begs to lie down, every second awake feels like drowning in molasses.

I don’t think I’ll wake up this time, but if you find this, please listen. Don’t download the app. Don’t even look at it. Because once it gets in, it will take everything. Your days, your nights, and eventually, your life. It’s not about sleep.

 It’s about control.
