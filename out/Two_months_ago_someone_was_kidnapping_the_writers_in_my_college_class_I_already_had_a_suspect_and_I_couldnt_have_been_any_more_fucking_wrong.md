Rowan Carlisle was the first to go missing—and in a class full of creatives all trying to reach the top, at first we were kind of… relieved.

We thought he’d dropped out.

He was an amazing writer. I could see his name dominating the New York Times Best Seller list in the future.

I was a little jealous of Rowan. 

If you think I’m going to say I wasn’t jealous of his skills you must be naive. Next to Kenji Cato, he was probably one of our best. I’ve read his writing, and it was… perfect. It flowed well, his world building was easy to imagine, and he often flirted with different genres. Fantasy was his favourite. That was obvious after his Game Of Thrones inspired short story had been shortlisted for a writing competition we had all entered weeks earlier. I don’t know, Rowan just knew the genre. He was born to be a writer. I guess being an amateur myself, I was always scared of being that one person who wasn’t born to be a writer. 

Who didn’t have natural talent. 

After all, it is human to feel that powerful burst of emotion, fire burning through your veins and igniting your synapses when someone happens to be fundamentally better than you at something. For some people it’s not a problem. They see competition as fun and playful. Like kids in a playground fighting to be the best. 

But it can become a problem if you can’t control it. Jealousy can cause us to go just a little bit crazy with that obsession, that overwhelming urge to be better. 

Whether that something is a sport, a type of creativity, or just in general. In my case, it was writing. I loved writing. Ever since I was a kid, I had my heart set on making a mark in the literary world. I wrote my first novel at the age of ten. By “novel” I mean a rip-off of Harry Potter written in the back of my dad’s notebook. 

It wasn’t good—obviously. I had just copied and pasted an already established premise and added my own characters. But to my ten-year-old self, it was enough validation that I could become a writer. So, I started writing more. High School was where I realised I wanted to make a career out of it. I joined creative writing clubs full of kids who shared their story ideas and helped each other. It was cute. 

Every Monday, we all gathered in the old band room and took turns telling each other either ideas for stories or plots we had pieced together—world’s we were building, whether fantasy or modern.

We became a close-knit group of friends, often meeting after school over burgers and milkshakes to swap ideas under the late setting sun.

Cute. I’m describing it like an actual novel.

I felt like I was in one. I figured a lot of things about myself through this writing group. Even my own sexuality.

Those days really were the best years of my life—so far. To get to know creatives who shared the same ideas and gave constructive criticism, which was both brutally honest and helpful, was exactly what I needed. I got it in my head that the college writing community would be just like that. Maybe a little more competitive, but I was ready for it. I was expecting pretty much the same but in a different environment. College was where I could make connections, friends, and maybe even collaborate with like minded people. I was wrong. Very wrong.

Obviously. You were waiting for me to write that, weren’t you? I’m sure you have all experienced it. You’re told you’re a gifted child from a young age and you start to believe it. Whether that is academics, singing—anything, really. 

Your passion is what drives you. However, when you get to college to pursue that passion, you find yourself no longer the so called “special one”. Because everyone else in that class were also “special” and “gifted”.  

Because I might have been one of the best writers in my senior class, along with the rest of the creative writing kids. I may have gotten awards for my short stories and told by teacher after teacher that I was actually going to get somewhere. That I was going to be a writer. College is… I guess it's different. It’s very different from high school. Or I guess it depends what kind of class you end up in.

I’ve never been that close to my creative writing class. You would expect a group of creatives to share synergy. Ideas from different minds clashing into a beautiful explosion of originality. Writers are each other’s stepping stones. They help each other get better and further up the ladder leading to publishing. My class are different. We helped each other, sure. The conversations at the start of every class were supposed to inspire our own individual stories. But outside class, outside that one classroom where we met every Monday to Thursday at 9am, we didn’t really talk to each other. 

I guess that’s what happens when you put a class of introverts together. They will either latch onto each other and become best friends for life—or prefer their own company and go back to hiding in their shells. I’m not saying the whole class are like that, but I’d say around 80% of them stay in their own little bubble while the rest have already formed into clique-like groups. It was harder than I thought to become friends with a fellow writer. Because like me, their heads were always in the clouds, thinking up new ideas, fantasy worlds, and characters. I think we had all made a silent agreement to cheer each other on without actually communicating.

Rowan Carlisle had in fact not dropped out. He hadn’t gone home early for the holidays or come down with a mysterious sickness leaving him bedridden and unable to contact our professor. 

All of our theories were wrong. Because a few days later, two officers interrupted our morning class to take us out one by one and interview us on our whereabouts during the time he vanished. Fiction and reality stand out to a writer. To me, fiction was officers asking for my character’s alibi and demanding to know questions they couldn’t answer which would further the narrative and shape the story. I watched cop shows. That kind of shit happened in cop shows. Not real life. Yes, I was sheltered. I had never been in trouble or witnessed an arrest or questioning. 

I grew up in my own bubble.  So, when fiction and reality bled together, and I found myself sitting in front of a stern faced woman answering questions about my none-existent friendship with Rowan, I realised this was really happening. Suddenly, we were all feeling incredibly guilty for seeing our classmate’s disappearance as an opportunity to get ourselves up that metaphorical ladder. Rowan Carlisle was officially a missing person—and had been for the last three days. The news got around campus quick, with the rumour mill churning out different variations of the same story which got progressively more insane.

I grabbed lunch in the cafeteria, overhearing that Rowan was dead in the town lake, tied up under an ex-girlfriend’s bed, and murdered by a homeless guy. Brutal. I was in there for maybe five minutes and the student body were all collectively more creative than my entire class put together. They didn’t have much empathy either, seeing our classmate more as a character in a story than a living and breathing person with a family and loved ones who were probably going crazy looking for him. 

I guess I can describe the following days as constantly being on edge, and subconsciously waiting for the announcement that he was either dead or alive. An announcement did come. But it had nothing to do with Rowan. 

Instead, another student had reportedly gone missing. After not hearing from her for two days, and then contacting their daughter’s housemates, Imogen Rode’s parents officially reported her missing. 

We didn’t notice. Imogen was more of a shadow, a silhouette, than a human being.  She was always in the back of the class with her head down, earphones corked in. When she spoke up in discussion which was rare, her answers were perfectly articulated and intelligent. Imogen’s story ideas were well fleshed out but lacked realistic characters. 

But her writing style was eye-catching. Very Leigh Bardugo.

Obviously, after Imogen going missing too, the police broadened their investigation. Two students in the same class vanishing three days apart. They weren’t exactly public about the case, though it was clear that they were now looking into a possible serial kidnapper with strong connections to us.

The question on everybody’s mind was: Who would abduct creative writing students? Seriously. What could amateur writers really bring to the table? People started wondering out loud and questioning Imogen and Rowan. Maybe they had been dating or were mutual friends with someone dangerous.  

Class was cancelled, and the college playing with an attempt at introducing a curfew for all students in the English department. But people were sceptical. 

They still thought the abductions were random and it was a coincidence the two were writers. I guess they had seen too many crime TV shows. They started pointing fingers at Rowan. Because of course he murdered Imogen out of love and went on the run. That’s what their favourite murder documentaries insisted. Like I said, the kids at our college didn’t have a filter. And to them, my classmates were nothing but names. Caricatures. 

A group of girls stormed the English building and demanded to know what Rowan had done to Imogen and had been swiftly dragged away. Tao Aster disappeared the morning after. 

Same story. He never returned home after studying at the library all night. People shut their mouths. And it began to hit us—both the college and our class, that these kidnappings weren’t random. Gender didn’t matter to this person. They were taking boys and girls. And mutual attraction in fact wasn’t a factor. Someone was hunting down members from our group. There was real intention behind these abductions. They wanted us for reasons which were unclear—or I guess people just didn’t want to say what they were thinking. This person was leaving no traces, no footprints to follow. The police said they were following witness statements and fresh leads, but it was obvious they were getting nowhere.

Rowan, Imogen and Tao had been kidnapped, whisked away, and I started to fear for my own life. I started to wonder if I too was going to have the same fate. And so this sort-of waiting game began. It was only a matter of time before another of us was taken. It could have been any of us—and I already had an idea who the next victim was going to be. This kidnapper wasn’t clumsy. They were level-headed and calculating. Already fifty steps ahead with contingency plans in place. The bastard had snatched Tao Aster right under the police’s nose.

I had no doubt they wouldn’t strike again.

Now, I had a theory. Especially after finding out Tao had been in the middle of getting his novel published professionally. Imogen was already working with a group of seniors to get her story adapted into a professionally shot student film, and Rowan had won multiple awards for his short stories. It wasn’t a secret that these three were at the top of our class. 

Their names were on our professors lips every week, their work being read out and critically discussed like they were works of genius. 

They kind of were. Along with Kenji Cato, these three were going to be professionally publishing straight out of college. Which made me wonder if jealousy was a factor. I wasn’t interested in looking into it myself, but everyone had their own opinions and theories. I had a feeling the kidnappings were personal. And the perpetrator was in fact a member of our class hiding in plain sight. 

Sure, I couldn’t prove this. Because it sounded insane. But it made sense.

The victims were only in our class, and the kidnapper clearly had connections to us. I had suspected Eleanor Martinez ever since she stammered during a group interrogation, and when she failed to provide a concrete alibi for the night of Rowan’s disappearance. The police investigation was private, but that didn’t stop us openly discussing our alibi’s (Which brought us together a lot more). When Eleanor was asked, she stumbled through an account of her visiting her friends to hang out.

That was a lie.

I had overheard multiple times that she was being ghosted by her usual circle. That was Exhibit A. Exhibit B was Eleanor herself. 

Out of all of the students in our class, she was probably the weakest in terms of writing—and was trying to get a publishing deal. It didn’t seem out of the realm of possibility that Elanor Martinez had gone to extreme lengths to achieve this. By kidnapping the strongest writers in our class. 

We can be driven to insanity through jealousy and become the worst versions of ourselves through envy. Imagine it as reverting back to default. Logic no longer matters. Or morality. All we can think about is getting what we want, and that was Eleanor. She wanted to be better. And by using them for own personal gain, she was.

I thought I had it in the bag—or maybe I’d been watching too much Criminal Minds. Humans  are scarier than the paranormal, after all.

Unfortunately, though, there was a hole in my theory.

Kenji Cato. I would go as far as saying Kenji was better than Rowan. His writing and illustrations were heavily inspired by Junji Ito, but with his own horrific spin. Kenji’s work drew the breath from my lungs. He was incredible. Incredible enough to be envious of. However, Kenji hadn’t been taken. The student most likely to be among the first was still standing.

It was confusing, but I was already weaving theories in my head. Maybe the kidnapper was saving Kenji for last. I was sure the kidnapper wasn’t killing them, unless they were good at hiding the bodies with no trace. So, what had they done with my classmates? And why was this person leaving our most talented student until last?

I shouldn’t have been thinking that. But put yourself in my shoes. I was terrified for my life. It was better to theorise than think of the inevitable. Dead and thrown in a ditch. What a way to go, huh? Maybe not even dead. I shivered at the thought of having a Misery-stye fate.

“Eleanor Martinez?”

Five days after Tao’s disappearance, I was sitting in a local Starbucks just off of campus. My friend Nona sat opposite me, her lips curled around her straw. I had a caramel macchiato, but I was too nervous to drink it. Every time my phone flashed with a notification, my stomach slithered into my throat. “Seriously?” Nona’s eyes were wide. She leaned forward, resting her chin on her fist. “Why do you think its her?”

Wrapping my hands around my drink, I shrugged. Instantly, I regretted voicing my private thoughts. I watched a flurry of snowflakes dance outside the window, revelling in the warm glow of the store. The smell of gingerbread cookies was the cherry on top.  

“I just…have a feeling.”

She cocked a brow, leaning back in her chair. “Eleanor doesn’t really give me serial kidnapper vibes,” My friend’s lip quirked. Ever since the kidnappings started, Nona was acting like my bodyguard, following me around everywhere. It was cute. But sometimes I just wanted to go to the bathroom without her standing directly outside the stall. “You’re still not giving me a concrete answer why you think it’s her, Cassie.”

“Eleanor is a bad writer.” I said. And then I rethought that. “Not bad. I mean… she’s just kind of a mess. Her writing is repetitive.”

“So, like you?” Nona smirked, and I shoved her.  Nona was right. Like Eleanor, I had also been called out for messy storytelling.

“Will you listen to me?” I rolled my eyes. But Nona’s usual playful attitude was making me feel better. Leaning forward, I met my best friend’s gaze. “Think about it,” I said. “If you were a mediocre writer and had no chance of publishing yourself, wouldn’t you try and get some help?”

Nona hummed. “So, you think she’s got them tied up somewhere so they can help her write?”

I nodded, slapping the table with a little too much gusto. A few tables back, a woman with a child turned her head to shoot me a glare.

“Exactly!”

“Why wouldn’t she just ask them?” Her lip curved. “Actually. Now that I think about it. You said three of the top writers have been taken.  So, what about—"

“Don’t.” I cut her off before she could say it. “I know what you’re going to say, and I’m trying to figure that out too.”

Sipping her drink, my friend fixed me with a look. She reached across the table and grabbed my hand teasingly. “Oh, yeah? What was I going to say?”

I tugged my hand away. “Kenji.”

Nona’s lips curved into a smile. “The next Stephen King.”

Shooting her a pensive look, I sipped my drink. It was the perfect temperature running down my throat. “I wouldn’t go that far.”

“Oh, who’s jealous now?”

Ignoring Nona's teasing, I tightened my grip on my drink. Kenji had been a sore subject of conversation ever since my last encounter with him. I had known the guy almost a year, and this was the first time I actually spoke to him. 

We knew each other only vaguely through clashing ideas in class. He had been inspired by an idea I had been stupid enough to tell a class full of creatives. In his defence, the story was good. Better than mine. Imagine The Drifting classroom but westernised with enough innovation to stand on its own. 

My initial idea was more geared towards Lord Of The Flies. But Kenji had taken it a whole other direction, twisting it into a macabre masterpiece. Though I was still pissed off with him. The fact that he had used the idea without asking left a weird taste in my mouth. Anyway, our first conversation was more of a back-and-forth which got progressively more frustrating. I was unfortunate to get my car stuck in snow last Winter, and while I was on hold to the repair company, struggling with my tires, I'd twisted around to find his silhouette leaning casually against the trunk. He startled me by slamming his hands into the paintwork. “Need help?” 

He cleared his throat, and my already thinning patience began to disintegrate.  I couldn’t even see him, and I knew the guy was smiling. Kenji was always smiling. A smile which surely held skeletons. Nobody in their right mind was that happy all the god damn time. I often wondered if his grin was going to split his mouth open. Back then, I was in a mood sour enough to control my thoughts. I really thought he was laughing at me. Because unlike him, I was yet to turn in my final paper.

“I’m good.” I didn’t turn away from tackling with my car’s wheel.

“You don’t look good,” Kenji said in a sing-song voice. He slapped my trunk. “Come on, I’ll give you a ride. I can get us there in five.”

This time, I  did turn around, blowing into my ice-cold hands. Kenji was jumping up and down, shivering in a sweater. 

Blinking rapidly, I shook my head, taking all of him in. Kenji, with his dorky glasses which were too big for his face, freckles speckling his cheeks, and curly dark hair poking from under his hood. 

He always looked like he’d gotten dressed in the dark, and that morning was no exception, brandishing an untucked shirt and skinny jeans which made him look like some kind of 2010’s hipster. Maybe that was the appeal. Maybe Kenji wanted to look like Harry Potter if he’d been born in the late 90’s. “I said I’m good,” I forced a smile at him.  “But thank you. Really. I’ll be there soon.”

He cocked his head, folding his arms across my chest. “But class starts in ten minutes.”

“Yes. I know.” The damn tire was refusing to come off, and my fingers kept slipping. “It’s just a breakdown.”

Kenji chuckled. “You or the car?”

There was pause, and in that pause I considered scooping up wet sleet off of the sidewalk and throwing it in his face.

“Okay, not funny.” He said. “But seriously, we’re both going to be late. I’ve got heated seats and you can use the aux chord.”

I didn’t try hiding the annoyance in my tone at that point. “Like I said, I’ll be there soon. Just go to class.” I thwacked the tire. “Please.”

Kenji’s smile faded. He jutted his chin like I’d personally offended him, turned away from me and walked away with a scoff.

“Fine. Suit yourself.”

Ever since that day, Kenji had made it his mission to one-up me in class. Despite already being at the top, he still wanted to be better than me. Which included talking over me during class discussion, intentionally taking my ideas and using them as his own, and ignoring every word which came out of my mouth. That’s right. 

Kenji was a wolf in sheep’s clothing. 

Maybe he was the one taking writers. In all the kiddie cartoons I used to watch, the evil villains always wanted to absorb energy or intelligence or abilities from the main characters. Maybe Kenji Cato was power hungry, and had taken Rowan, Tao and Imogen for his own sick enjoyment.

Shaking off the thought, I looked up to see Nona had an odd expression. Her gaze flitted to someone behind me. “Heads up,” she smirked a little. “Your serial kidnapper is right behind you.”

Following Nona’s eyes, I twisted around to see Eleanor Martinez making her way over to us in long, stumbling strides.

Immediately, I knew something was wrong. The girl was dishevelled, an explosion of dirty blonde hair hanging in her face. 

Before I could greet her, she grabbed my arm. I bit back a wince. Her grip was tight. I wanted to pull away, but seeing her expression, her wide eyes and rapidly paling cheeks, my resolve crumbled. The girl was already  attracting attention. We weren’t exactly front page news, but surely patrons around us were putting two and two together. “Can I talk to you?” Eleanor hissed out. Her frenzied eyes flitted to a confused looking Nona.

“Alone.”

Jumping up from my seat, I shot a look at Nona. “I’ll be right back, okay?”

“Cass, is that a good idea?” Nona gestured to the darkening sky. “It’s getting pretty late.”

“Relax, It’s not even six.” I gave Nona a reassuring nod before turning to my classmate. “What’s up?”

Eleanor let out a shuddery breath. “I need to talk to you. Like now.” She was practically vibrating, bouncing on the heels of her shoes.

Nona jumped up, her eyes widening. “Wait—"

Eleanor was dragging me away before Nona could finish her sentence. She kept a wicked grip on my arm, yanking me back through the doors and out into icy cold air. 

In the distance, I glimpsed officers stationed around campus. They were supposed to look after us, but I’d caught two of them mindlessly scrolling through their phones. Struggling to get my jacket on, I stumbled after Eleanor, who was getting more and more frenzied. She didn’t stop until I was almost tripping over myself, and she was gasping for breath. 

The girl had pulled me into a back-alley. I started to get nervous. Maybe my theory was right. When Eleanor reached into her pocket, my stomach slithered into my throat. But she didn’t pull out a rag soaked with chloroform, or a weapon. Instead, it was her phone. I recognised the baby blue phone cover.

“I think…” Eleanor spoke in sharp gasps of breath, swiping at her eyes. “I think they tried to take me last night.”

The spindly legs of a spider creeped their way down my spine. Swallowing hard, I struggled to take in her words. “What?”

“The kidnapper!” She shrieked. “The one who… who took Rowan, and the others. They tried to take me!”

Eleanor was shaking. Every word spitting in my face. She could barely coerce words. “I… I was… I managed to get away… but I… I…”

Offering her an awkward hug, I did my best to calm her down. She buried her head in my shoulders, her words muffling into incoherent babbling. I managed to pick up pieces of the story, but then she freaked out again, bursting into heaving sobs violently wracking her body.

“Slow down, Ellie. Tell me what happened.”

Eventually, she did tell the whole story, managing to recall the whole thing in barely a single breath.

Well, there went my theory.

Still though, could I believe Eleanor? She looked freaked, sure. But this kidnapper was smart. I bet they could fake a panic attack.

However, even I knew that I was being ridiculous with that theory. It clearly wasn’t Eleanor. The girl was a mess.

“Wait, this happened last night?” Pulling away from the hug, I reached in my jacket for a handkerchief. “Then why are you—"

“I don’t know, I panicked!” She wailed. “We’ve had cops guarding the student dorms, so I managed to sneak out! And I… well, I saw you.”

“Why are you coming to me?” I demanded in a hiss. “Shouldn’t you be going to the police? Ellie, that’s what they’re there for!”

The girl held my gaze before lifting her phone. She took a deep breath, blowing hair out of her face. “I think I got it on camera, Cassie.”

“You got what on camera?”

“Them.”

Her eyes glittered with—excitement. She was terrified, practically traumatised. But to have a piece of the investigation in her hand…

I think it thrilled her.

My gaze flashed to her phone. I admit, I was intrigued. But I also really needed her to get a hold of herself and go to the cops.

“Ellie.” I spoke calmly, gently grabbing her shoulders. “I’m not the one you should be talking to. You need to show this to the police.”

But the girl was inconsolable. I don’t even think she was on this planet. “Look!” Ellie was shaking, tears running in fresh rivulets down her cheeks. She shoved the phone in my face, and in the dim glow of a distant lamppost illuminating the alley, I could make out a video player on the screen. 

Eleanor pressed play, and I found myself watching a half a minute video of a struggle. It started like a TikTok. She was filming herself talking about something trivial before a shadowy figure grabbed her from behind, slamming their hand over her mouth. She screamed, trying to squirm her way out of their grasp. And somehow, she was successful. 

The screen went black, and all I could hear was her muffled squealing—before she was let go, gasping for breath. The POV of the phone changed when the girl dropped to the ground, scrambling with the camera. I should have been looking at my classmate gasping for breath, trying to describe who tried to kidnap her in heaving breaths. But I wasn’t. Instead, my gaze was on the sliver of licence plate bleeding into the dark as the car sped off down the road.

Ellie was speaking, but her voice was white noise. “There are more of them,” she hissed out. “I’m not crazy, right? Can you hear the footsteps?"

I could.

Three or four separate pairs of footsteps.

But that wasn’t what I was concentrating on.

Suddenly, I couldn’t fucking breathe. My vision feathered around the edges, and I was aware of how cold it was, the ice cold creeping into my blood. With shaky hands, I reached out for her phone, thoughts spiralling into a vicious hurricane. “Ellie, could I have another look?”

My fingers twitched, an overwhelming urge coming over me. I needed that phone.

I needed that fucking phone.

But there was something else, something lurking under my flesh, a burning need to not just grab her phone, but shut her up. I could sense something at the corner of my eye, something bleeding into the dark. It was darker than black, liquid oblivion creeping its way closer and closer to me. 

Sucking in a breath, I felt something on my skin, sinking into my bones and entangling itself around me. It was only there for a moment. Just a single second. This heavy weight on my chest, the sensation of drowning, plunging me further into the dark. And then it was gone. I blinked. 

The slithering tendril of blackness poking from the dim night was gone, and the suffocating urge, a thirst to do something terrible with no empathy and no thought—was gone. It told me to look away. It always told me to look away, to be ignorant and peer straight forwards.

I wasn’t allowed to find the corner of my eye. Clarity, for a lot of people, is relieving. It’s reality bleeding into your brain. But for me, it was a nightmare. I had to look away. Had to ignore. “Ellie, give me the phone.” I spoke in a hiss of breath, fashioning a reassuring smile.  

I must have looked desperate. Trying a different approach, I grabbed her hands gently, flinching when my fingernails sliced into her.

“Ow! Have you ever cut your nails?”

“Please.” I gritted out. “I think I… saw something.”

Eleanor nodded, thrusting it in my face. “See! Can you see them? Do you think this is enough to catch them?” She surprised me with an excited squeak. “Does this mean we’ve got them? And they… they won’t try and take me again, right? I fought them off. I escaped them!”

“Yeah.” I gasped out. “I think so.” I didn’t look at the video again. Trying not to barf, I stabbed the menu option on the video, tapped DELETE, and handed her the phone back. “I’ve gotta go, okay?” My legs were shaking. “I should probably… get home, you know? It’s getting late.” I was power-walking away from her back down the alleyway before she could answer. 

It took maybe half a minute for her to notice what I had done. I heard her shoes crunch in gravel when she twisted around, her breath coming out in sharp pants. “Wait… what did you do?”

I kept going, my legs threatening to give-way.

“Cassie!”

Eleanor’s voice followed me when I catapulted into a stumbled run. “Did you delete the video?”

“Did I?” I yelled over my shoulder. “I don’t know how to use Android’s! Sorry, Ellie!”

“It’s a Google Pixel!”  

“Same thing!” I bit back.

“What? Cassie, where are you going?!”

I didn’t turn back. I couldn’t. I didn’t stop until I was home and slamming the door behind me, locking it. I couldn’t talk to Eleanor or let her turn that video into the cops—because the car which almost ran her over, which was the get-away vehicle in her attempted kidnapping —--- was fucking mine. No matter how many times I went over it in my head, over and over again until I was driving myself mad, It didn’t make sense why it was my car. 

Had it been stolen? No, because my car was always parked in the exact same spot every morning. Untouched. I started to pace, clawing my hair out. So, how was it involved in Eleanor Martinez’s attempted kidnapping? I considered a lot of things at that moment. I wanted to call Nona and tell her everything. But then I got a hold of myself—of how bad that would sound.

“Oh by the way, you know the getaway car kidnapping members of my class? Yeah, it's mine.” 

Nona was my closest friend and I loved her like a sister, but I couldn’t trust her. 

Pulling back the curtain in my lounge, I pressed my face against frosted glass. 

There were cops everywhere, stationed across campus and the student neighbourhood. They asked questions if you want out after dark, so I stayed inside and slowly drove myself more and more insane with questions which didn’t make sense. Answers which I needed, but I was scared to know them. Eventually, after a lot of googling, and then deleting my search history, I fitted myself with the tiny camera I’d gotten for my parents kitty to get a POV of what s cat’s life was like. Google told me there was a possibility I was sleepwalking.

Maybe I was putting my car keys in an obvious place and allowing the kidnappers to use my car—or they were just really good at breaking into my house and not leaving a single trace. I went to sleep that night with a lump in my throat. The next morning, I woke with a dull pounding at the back of my head. Something was scrunched in my fist.

It was… soft. Blinking sleep from my eyes, I found myself staring at a scrap of checker shirt.

I didn’t have any checker shirts. Nona tried to lend me one, but I hated the clash of colours. When I really thought about it, though, I remembered what Eleanor had been wearing the day before. I remembered her arm snapping out and grasping mine, plaid pink poking from her parka sleeve. No. Swallowing hard, I stuffed the torn plaid under my pillow. My gaze flicked to something on my carpet. 

The camera. I’d torn it off. Instead of raking my thoughts about why I had a scrap of Elanor Martinez’s sleeve, I connected the camera to my laptop quickly, bringing up several video clips which had been recorded through the night.  Watching the POV, it seemed normal at first. It stayed still because I was sleeping. A few seconds went by, and I was hovering my finger over the trackpad, ready to click off—before I sat up and jumped out of bed. 

The camera was shaky as I pulled on a jacket, then my shoes, and grabbed my keys. I only had to watch myself jump into my car, and in flickering footage blurring in and out, seeing my apparent destination, my parents' cabin in the woods, before I was shutting off the footage, stuffing my laptop under my bed, and forcing my legs outside. It was early morning, and thankfully no cops were on their patrol.

Feeling progressively sicker, I climbed into my car. The seat was warm, the radio still playing at a low volume. There was no logical explanation to why I had sleep-driven to my parents cabin in the woods in the middle of the night. 

No explanation to why I couldn’t remember, and that I’d woken up with Eleanor Martinez’s sleeve scrunched in my fist, a striking pain in the back of my head. My thoughts kept creeping towards a very obvious answer—but I wouldn’t yet entertain it. When I stabbed the ignition on, my car’s engines rumbling to life, a mumbling sound caught me off guard.

It was the radio, I thought, stiffening up. But then it came again. Louder. With shaking hands, I switched off the radio. I waited a beat, and there it was again. Mumbling, followed by a loud bang. Twisting around, I scanned  the backseat. 

Before my gaze inevitably flicked to the trunk. I shook my head, spluttering out a disbelieving laugh. There was no way. However, when I started to back up my car, cranking the radio up, the muffling continued. I could hear it no matter how hard I tried to block it out, tried to pretend it wasn’t there. There it was again. In the corner of my eye. Something was there, slithering into my brain. It told me not to look. It told me to ignore it and turn away. 

Go back inside, the disembodied voice, which was both mine and not, murmured into the back of my head.

Something cold crept its way up my leg. Pooling black. I felt it entangling itself around me, going up and up and up before finding my neck.

Winding itself around my throat.

Squeezing my eyes shut, I forced myself to breathe. I stopped looking, stopped searching for what was slowly slipping its way into my reality, and the pooling blackness sinking into my flesh was gone. I climbed out of my car, checked to see if anyone was lurking around, and took slow, shaky steps toward the trunk of my car. 

The muffling grew louder until I couldn’t call it incoherent anymore. This was shouting. Screaming. A mouth which had clearly been gagged. When I yanked open the trunk, I was greeted to what I expected. The trash bags I’d been planning to get rid of, full of old childhood toys, old bed covers, a pile of comic books I was supposed to donate to the local thrift store—and something wriggling in between all of it, a very human looking figure lying face down on my mom’s ancient rug. 

Something snapped inside me, and I reached out, rolling them onto their front. Kenji Cato. I almost slammed the trunk in his face. 

Kenji was curled into the foetal position, his arms pinned behind his back, a slab of duct tape over his mouth. There was no sign of his glasses, streaks of scarlet colouring pale cheeks, and a yellowing bruise under his left eye. The boy squinted at me for a moment, blinking, his eyes widening. He muffled something, but I was too busy staring at what glistened on his forehead. Not sweat. 

When I leaned forward to rip off the tape, I caught a familiar whiff of chemicals. My dad worked as a mortician, and I could have sworn Kenji Cato was covered in embalming fluid.

I checked his arms and legs. Yep. He was dripping.

Swallowing a shriek, I struggled to coerce words. “It’s okay.” I said in a hiss. “It’s okay! I’m… I’m going to help you.”

I ripped off the tape, flinching when Kenji let out a very loud, “Argh!”

Before I could speak, he choked up what looked like… prunes. Swimming in bloody saliva. “You’re her?!” He yelled. “You’re Bronte?!”

“Bronte?”

Kenji coughed violently, a string of bloody prune mush slipping down his chin. His eyes were wild. I’d never seen him like that.

“Oh, you’re going to pretend last night never happened?” He hissed. “You’re Brontë?”  He laughed. “You? Fucking Cassie Hughes?”

Resisting the urge to shut him up, I lifted my head to see if we were alone. Thankfully, we were.

Turning back to him, I helped him sit up. “What are you…” I trailed off. “Did someone force feed you prunes?”

Kenji didn’t reply, struggling violently. “Let me go.” He said through his teeth. “You’re all fucking crazy!”

All?

I started to speak, before he was lunging forwards with wild eyes. I managed to grab him, with an instinct I didn’t know I had. Kenji noticed, his resolve crumbling.  “I swear to god,” He spoke in a low growl. “Let me go, you psycho bitch. Or I’ll scream and I will not stop screaming.”


“Kenji—”

I was interrupted by a voice. 

A woman was walking over, a shadow getting closer. “Young lady, what are you doing?”

The boy’s eyes widened. He opened his mouth to start yelling, and I gagged him with my hand, leaning close.

That chemical scent grew stronger, choking my nose and throat.

“Listen to me,” I gritted through my teeth. “If you squeal, we’ll never know what’s going on. Because I promise you. Whatever you saw, whatever you think you saw—- that wasn’t me. And if we’re going to figure out why this is happening, I need you to NOT get me arrested.”

I didn’t realise how desperate I was, every word emphasised in globules of saliva hitting him in the face. “You want to know what happened to the others, right?”

Instead of nodding, he scoffed.

Slowly, I removed my palm, and twisted around with the biggest grin I could muster.

“We’re film students,” I said, gesturing to Kenji. “It’s for our final exam, so it has to look… really real.” I jutted my chin at Kenji.


“Kenji is our best performer. Right, Kenji?”

To my surprise, he gave a pathetic nod. “Sure.” He coughed again, this time bright red slipping down his chin. “Performer.”

The woman’s expression brightened. “Oh! I’ll be sure to look out for you at Sundance!”

I almost laughed. There was blood all over Kenji’s face, no  sign of cameras, I had him tied up in my trunk— and she still somehow believed my crazy  lie. When she was gone, Kenji dropped the act, his lips curving into a scowl. “You guys are going to jail for a long fucking time.”

His words twisted my gut. “I’m going to let you go,” I said, and his expression flickered with hope. “But…”

I really didn’t want to commit a felony—but Kenji Cato was the only one with any semblance of what was going on. I got a flash of a dark room illuminated in orangeade light. Three shadows— and a bleeding, creeping darkness spiralling over solid rock spattered intense red.

Shaking my head, pain grumbled in my temples. 

“I know you’re going to hate me,” I said, grabbing a roll of duct tape in the trunk, and tearing off another piece.

His eyes went huge. “Cass. No. Do you even realise what you’re doing? This is  kidnapping! You’re throwing your life away! And for what?”

Before I could stop myself, I slapped it over his mouth, and shoved him back.

“I need you to help me.” I said in a whispered rush, “Pleasethankyouiamsosorryandipromisei’llmakeituptoyou.”

Shutting the trunk on his muffled threats to my life, a lump had grown in the back of my throat. I wasn’t thinking about the fact that I was harbouring a human being in the back of my trunk as I began the drive to my parents' summer cabin in the woods. 

Instead, the same questions were exploding in my head. Who the fuck was Brontë?  What was the embalming liquid? The prunes, too. What was the deal with them? And most importantly…

Was I losing my fucking mind?
