New  York,  dark  and  depressing.  If  you  were  a  comics  nerd  it  would  remind  you  of  Gotham  from  the Batman  comics  but  that's  not  what  this  is  about.  
Basketball  that's  what  this  is  about,  MSG  madison   square  garden  is  where  our  story  begins  the  worst  seats  in  the  house.  Nosebleeds  we  could  barely see  the  wood  of  the  basketball  floor. 
 We  are  Matt  and  my  buddy  Luke.  I  was  disappointed   it  was my  idea  Luke  tried  to  keep  me  joyful  with  a  smile  but  he  failed.  I  was  sad,  but  at  least  the  Knicks were  winning  for  now  at  halftime. 
 I  needed  to  use  the  restroom,  but  I  could  see  the  line  from  my seat.  
Almost  the  only  thing  in  my  sight,   other  than  the  scoreboard.  That was  filling  my  brain  with  numbers and  advertisements. PIZZA  it  read  as  my  stomach  growled  like  a  wolf. 
Pulling  my  phone  out  of  my  pocket, lightning  fast. Luke  knew  I  wasn't  paying  outrageous  prices  for  pizza  in  the  arena.  As  soon  as  I  opened  my  phone  I  felt cringe  seeing  the  receipts for  the  tickets. 
I  moved  on  scrolling  for  pizza  places till  I  found  a  good  deal  for  pizza.
 ‘’$10. FOR  A LARGE’’ I  read  aloud.
Luke  nodded  in  agreement, 
We  decided  to  go there  after  the  game. I  looked  up  from  my  phone realizing  halftime  was  already  passed, 
It  was  halfway through  the  third  quarter. The  knicks  were  doing great  so  I  jumped  up  from  my  seat  saying  aloud “’bathroom  be  right  back’’. Luke conformed  with  a  nod .

I  grabbed  the  beak  of  my  hat,  tightening  it  on  my head. I  got  my  hat  in  7th  grade  on  my  12th  birthday. 
My  head  had  gotten  bigger  since  then  it  was  on  its last  notch. 
An  orange  hat  with  a  blue  accent  reading KNICKS on  the  front  in  black  lettering. 
Pushing  my  phone  into  my  right  pocket  and  picking  up  my  pace. 
Opening  the bathroom  door  with  ease,  surprised  when  I  saw  only  one  man  in  the  restroom.  
An  older  man  had  to  be  in  his  late  70s  early  80s  
rocking  a  gray  hoodie  with  the  same  Knicks  logo  on  front. Black  Adidas  shoes,   
Gray  hair  with  a  black  accent,  and  a  complete  silver  gray  mustache.  
“Hello, Are you  enjoying  the  game,  Son?” 
He  said  aloud  in  a  crisp  voice  like  the  autumn  leaves. Replying  
 “Yeah,  as  much  as I  can.” 
He  walked  past  me  saying “good.”
while  throwing away  his  wet  paper  towel. He  opened  and  closed  the door  with  ease.
Walking  to  the  stall. Going  inside the  stall  and  locking  it  behind  me.
Starting  to  do  my  business, then  finishing  after  using  the  bathroom. Spinning  around  to  open  the  door,  my  foot  lifted  up  awaiting  my  next  step  till  “Hello” shocked me. It  whispered  in  a  deep  raspy  voice. “Hello” I  heard  it  whisper  again  louder. 
Taking  a  step  back,  almost  falling  in  the  toilet,  pulling my  phone  back  out  of  my  right  pocket. 
Going  to  my messages  right  under  Luke typing  “HELP bathroom now.” 
Proper  grammar  isn't  the biggest  problem  right  now.  
It  was, “HELLO” it squealed  now  on  the  brink  of  screaming.  I  gasped, then  fear  gripped  me. 
Looking  down  and  seeing  massive  gray  barefoot  feet  claws  for  nails.
Fear  grabbed  me  harder  than  it  ever  had  before  but I  had  to  expel  it. “HELLO”  
it  rang  my  eardrums  as  IT  screamed  at  me  louder  than  it  did  before. 
I  had  to respond  but  “HELLO” it  shouted  like  an  alarm  blasting  through  my  eardrums.  
Screaming  back  with  my  anger. “GET OUT, BACK OFF!” 
trying  to  not  show  fear, trying  to  be  as  manly  as  possible. 
Then  the  feet stepped  back.  I  heard  the  bathroom  door  open  and close.
Taking  a  sigh  of  relief  that  my  nightmare  was over.  Then  I  felt  the  stall  shaking.  
Feeling  fear  and  once  again  I  looked  down  expecting  those  cursed  talons.  
Till  I  saw  Adidas  shoes  on  the  bathroom  floor. 
Then  I  heard  “Son, are  you  alright  in  there?” 
A  weathered  voice  said.  I  took  a  deep  breath  and grabbed  the  stall  door  handle.  
Unlocking  it,  preparing  to  enter  society.  I  opened  the  door,  instant  regret  hit. 
Wishing I  could  have  screamed  and  left  one  last  imprint  of  life.












My  phone  went  back  into  my  pocket  after  I  had  read  the  frantic  message.
 My  body stood  up  fast,  running  one  foot  after  the  other  toward  the  bathroom.
 Nothing  stopped me  from  that  bathroom. Looking  past  worried  spectators  faces,  finding  myself  in  front  of  the  bathroom. Ripping  it  open  with  force,  a  musk  as  soon  as  I  entered  the  bathroom.  My  nose  was  almost  in  pain  from  the  smell. 
My  eyes  adjusted  to  the  bright  fluorescent, using  my  eyes  to  spectate  the  room.   
Running  past  the  stalls  opening  the  doors  of  each  one .
In  the  third  one  my  eyes  feasted  upon  a  discrepancy.  
Matt’s  hat,  sitting  on  the  bathroom  floor. 
Grabbing  it , thinking  why  would  He  leave  his  hat?  
My  eyes were overfilled  with  water. 
Crying  in  the  bathroom,  needing  help.  
Standing  up  feeling  a  bit  of vertigo,  my  legs  felt  a bit  wobbly. 
Fear  shook  my  bones, chilling  my  spine,  grabbing  my  spirit.
 Adrenaline  pumped  through  my  veins,  sprinting  out  of  the  bathroom. 
Searching  to  find  security,  police,  someone  to  find  my  friend.  
Running  around  the  arena,  my  feet  felt  as  light  as  a  feather  fueled  by  adrenaline.  Searching  for  authority,  I  found  a  man  with  a  yellow  vest 
 with  security  inscribed  on  the  back  of  it.  
Running  to  the  man  saying “ I  can’t  find  my  friend.”  
Flashing  his  hat  saying “ I  found  his  hat.”
 The  man  tried  to  calm  me  down but he couldn't .
 “Follow  me, Sir.” He  started  walking  away, my  feet  followed  his  steps.  
We  found  ourselves  in  a security  office. 
He  sat  me  down  in  the  seat, and  told  me  the  police  would  arrive  in  just  a  minute.
My  feet  tapped  on  the  floor  waiting  for  an  answer  to  my  problem. 
The  man  came  back  to  the  office  accompanied  by  a  police  officer.  
A  very  tall  man  in  a  police  regulated  uniform  with  flat  brown  hair.  
The  man  had  a  sincere  look  on  his  face. “My  name  is  Chris  Thompson, I’m  the  lead  detective  of the NYPD.” He  announced. I responded, “I’m  Luke.” 
 “You  can  just  call  me Chris,  we’re  going  to  find  your  friend  Luke.”
He  said  in  a  firm  but understanding  voice.  
My  mind  raced  with  ideas  thinking  if  they  really  could  find  him.
Informing  Chris  of  all  that  had  happened  that  day,  He  took  notes  in  his  notebook.  
“We’ve  closed  off  all  the  exits.” He  said,  finding  comfort  in  that  statement.  
Chris  led  me  to  the  monitor  in  the  room.  Typing  the  password. 
We both  prepared  ourselves  to  see  the  worst.
The  security  recording  started  to  roll,  first  starting  with  an  older  man  entering  the  restroom. Then  Matt,  The  old  man  left  right  after  He  entered.  
Then nothing, we  waited  for  something.  Holding  on  to  hope,  watching  the  film.  
No  one  entered  the  bathroom  for  minutes  until  me.  
Chris  looked  confused,  almost  nervous. 
The  video  continued  with  me  walking  out  of  the  bathroom,  searching  for  help  with  the  hat.  Chris  stood  up  saying “ I’ll   be  right  back Luke.” As  He  walked  out  of  the  room  searching  for  answers. My  body  ached  with  pain, the  video  stayed  on  continuing  as  police  and  security  officers  searched  the  restroom  for  the  young  man.  
After  minutes  of  agony  Chris  entered  the  room  once  again. 
He  walked  to  the  monitor, turning  it  off.
“Waiting  is  all  we  can  do.” He  said,  Accepting  this  fate  He  turned  the  tv  on  for  me. 
He  left  the  room  and  once  he  did  feelings  invaded  my  mind. 
 Wanting  to  cry,  scream,  and  vomit.   My  mind  raced  for  the  next  two  hours  as  the  game  ended  and  everyone  left  the  arena.  
Chris  came  back  to  the  room  accompanied  with  another  officer.  
“Are  you  ok?” He  asked. 
Seeing  the distress  and  sickness  visibly  on  my  face.
The  pain  was  deadly  and  vile. They  could  see  it  on  my  face.
“Medic,  Medic.”  Chris  said,  as  he  left  the  room  with  the  security  officer.
Minutes  later  the  medics  arrived  and  tried  to  cure  this  sickness.
After  they  gave  me  medicine  the  illness  slowed  down.
Still  in  pain  but  trying  to  progress  through  it.
“You  have  no  connection  to  the  disappearance  of  Matt  Young.
Chris  said  looking  at  me  after  this  I  don't remember  much.
The security  officer broke  his  silence  asking  me  if,
 I  knew  anyone  who  could  bring  me  home.
“Yeah” I  said  while  pointing  to  my  phone, too weak  to  grab  it.
Minutes later  he  arrived.  Joe,  my  childhood  friend, turned  into  my  roommate.
He  entered  the  room  with  a  scared  emotion  on  his  face,  which  was  uncommon  for  him.
He  was  a  big  man  over  6 '4  his  height  could  only  be  rivaled  with  Chris.
who  entered  the  room  after   joe,  “Are  you  good?”  
“What  happened to Matt?” He  questioned me.
  Chris  spoke up “ How  about  you  ask  him,  when  he  feels  better joe.”
Agreeing  with  the  statement  he  helped  me  up  along  with  Chris.
I'm  not  a  big  man, I'm  5 '8  on  a  good  day.  They  lifted  me  up  easily .
We  walked  out  of  the  room,  and  left  the  arena. 
Arriving  at  the  vacant  parking  garage,  only  two  cars  in   it.
My  2006  Honda Accord,  Matt  disliked  driving  especially in  New York.
He  didn't  even  own  a  car. If  he  needed  to  go  anywhere I  was  his  driver.
Next  to  my  car  was  Joe's  ugly  white  van  that  we  all  joked  with  him  about. 
This  time  it  was  a  comfortable  sight.  
He  sat  me  in  the  passenger seat and  closed  the door.
Chris and  Joe  talked  for  a few  minutes. 
 The  memory  of  the  topic  of  this  conversation  is  empty.
Trying  to  forget  about  this  illness,  closing  my  eyes.
When  they  opened  we  were  in  my  apartment's  parking lot.
Looking  at Joe  opening  my  door  trying  to  help  me  out  of  the  van. 
We  walked  inside  and  found  our  apartment.  Joe  laid  me  to  rest  on  my  bed. 
Joe  talked  to  my  other  roommate  Marcus at  the  entrance  to  my  room.
Marcus' face  was  lit  up  with  confusion.  Joe  tried  to  explain  the  puzzle  to  him.
My  heavy  eyes  closed  as I  fell  into  the  ocean  of  sleep. 












My  eyes  awaken  after  the  night  of  rest.  
Pain  is  still  destroying  my  body  and  leaving  me  in  bed.
Looking  up  from  my  bed  seeing  Marcus  once  again.  
His  face  filled  with  sadness  seeing  my  pain. 	
I've  only  known  Marcus  for  a  few  months  almost  a  year  now.
Met  him  when  we  dropped  the  advertisement  for  a  roommate.
He's  from  Jersey,  we  joked  with  him  all  the  time.
He  is  a  great  guy, who  is  very sincere.
“Are  you  good?” He  said  with  a  smooth  morning  voice.
My  head  nodded up  confirming the question.
Sickness was  still  affecting  me  and  he  saw, refraining  from  asking  more  questions.
He  left  the  room  and  came  back  once  again with  a  bottle  of  medicine.
Pain  relief  the  bottle  read  as  he  handed  me  the  pill.
Placing  it  into  my  mouth  as  I  swallowed  it.
Laying  there  my  sight  glazed  across  the  ceiling.
Both  of  my  feet  swung  to  the  side  of  the  bed.
Placing  them  to  the  ground, my  warm  feet  hit  the  cold  floor.
Standing  up,  vertigo  hit  spinning  my  world.
The  pain  was  unbearable  that  pain  medicine  could  do  nothing  to  this.
I  fell  back  on  the  bed  and  vomited.  Marcus  looked  at  me  with  sadness. 
Feeling  my  pain,  he  helped  me  up  and  we  headed  outside.
Where  he  sat  me  in  my  Honda  Accord  that  Joe  returned  to  the  apartment.
He  got  into  the  driving  seat  and  headed  to  the  hospital. 
He  handed  me   a  bag  and  I  vomited  in  it  multiple  times. 
The  pain  made  me  cry,  as  we  went  into the  parking  lot  of  the  hospital.
“Nurse! Nurse!” He  called  out  after  getting  out  of  the  car.  I  passed   out. 


Shades  of  reality  flashed  in  my  eyes.  
Waking  up  in  a  hospital  bed.  The  lights  interfere  with  my  rest.  My  head  beats   like  a  drum,  while  I  scout  the  room.  The  pain  was  constant   and   unbearable.  Then  an evil  thought  found  my  brain.  How  much  pain   was  Matt  in.
