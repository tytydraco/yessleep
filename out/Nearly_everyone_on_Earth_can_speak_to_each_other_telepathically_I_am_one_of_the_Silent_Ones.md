I am one of the Silent Ones. 

I am not supposed to know I am a Silent One. By unspoken agreement the Silent Ones are prevented from knowing that they are different. It's seen as a kindness, ignorance is indeed bliss. Even now I wish I could go back to not knowing.

I do not know how many of us there are. I cautiously estimate the number is one in ten thousand. Of those one in ten thousand only another one in ten thousand ever find out what I know: that Human society is secretly built around social structures and channels of communication to which Silent Ones are permanently excluded. We are the ultimate outsiders, deaf to almost all conversations taking place, mute to everyone around us. 

It's a chilling thought. Every person I have ever known and the vast majority of people I have ever interacted with have been privy to conversations that occur outside of my perception. 

I wonder why people even talk at all, what is the point of verbal communication? I have a few speculations. My most likely conjecture is that spoken word is a compliment to a much more complex and nuanced form of communication that occurs in the psychic channels that I am deaf to. 

Think of it like hand gestures and facial expressions. These can express ideas and emotions, but aren't truly effective at communication unless paired with the structure and vocabulary of language. I speculate that spoken word adds to psychic conversations what hand gestures and facial expressions add to exclusively spoken language.

 As a Silent One I do not percieve the full depth, complexity, or meaning of the conversations I participate in, and indeed there are entire conversations occuring all around me that I cannot percieve at all. Everyone I know is speaking behind my back and they aren't even doing it on purpose. 

There are three layers to communication: somatic/expressive, spoken, and psychic. As a Silent One I have access to the first two but not the third. A deaf person has access to the first and third but not the second (unless they learn sign language). A blind person has access to the second and third but not the first. Animals have access to the first only, their vocalizations are too primitive to qualify for the second.

I walk among society, isolated, alone. Before I knew I was a Silent One I thought everything was fine. I was always different, socially awkward, and always feeling like I was just a little behind everyone during conversations. People always said it was just social anxiety, maybe being mildly on the autism spectrum, normal stuff. 

Liars. Liars all of them. Things are not fine. I am fundamentally different from everyone else. Like a blind or deaf person I am Psychically Silent. A deaf person can learn sign language. A blind person can still use their own expressions and hand gestures (and the first layer of communication is the least important anyways). For a Silent person there is no remedy or solution that enables them to engage with all three layers like the other two sensory deprivations. We are alone. 

I have found out (I will explain how I found out in my next entry) that of the three layers of communication the psychic layer is the most complex and easily controlled. One is able to hold entire meaningful conversations with their mind alone with anyone else around them, and they have a good deal of control over who and how many their mental words are sent to, and can block out unwanted communication from others. Like shouting, speaking mentally over long distances requires more effort and loses subtlety, and eventually becomes impossible. Near as I can tell the psychic layer has the same approximate range as spoken conversation does. 

Then there's the silent ones who have none of that. 

Now, if you are reading this, you probably already know all this, even if you didn't know you knew. This is because you are not a Silent One and you were born with the full access to the human condition. 

But, if you are reading this and learning something new, I have bad news for you. Like me, you are a Silent One. 

People around you can be talking behind your back, insulting you with impunity, making fun of you, making running commentary on you and you can never know. People around you are forging deeper, more personal relationships than you can ever understand, while you are left behind to play guesswork. You are an outsider to every private joke, every hidden social interaction. Your friends have a secret group chat that you aren't a part of, except it's the entire world excluding us from their global group chat. Everyone got invited to the party except you. 

We walk among the world, the subject of their pity and private mockery. We will always fall behind in every category of socialization because we lack the final and most important layer of communication. 

We are the Silent Ones. 

In my next post I will tell you how I found out about all of this, and some of the deeper horrors behind the existence of this phenomenon that I have discovered.
