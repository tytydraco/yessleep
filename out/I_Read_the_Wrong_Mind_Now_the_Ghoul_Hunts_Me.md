Guys, I have to write this down, right now. I don't know if I'll finish, I don't know who will even believe me, but I have to try. Someone needs to know. My name is Adam, just a regular young guy like anyone else here in Cairo, maybe the only difference is… I have a gift? A curse? I don't know what to call it. I can hear people's thoughts. Yes, exactly like that. I read what's inside their heads.

It started when I was a kid. I thought they were hallucinations at first, voices inside my head that weren't mine. With time, I understood I was hearing the thoughts of those around me. It was terrifying initially, then it became amusing, then… an addiction. You can't imagine the amount of nonsense, drama, and crazy daydreams swirling in people's minds while you're just walking down the street or riding the metro. I used to entertain myself with them – finding out who hated their boss, who was cheating on their spouse, who was sick of their life, who was planning to skip work. I felt like a superhero sometimes, or maybe a little devil, eavesdropping on their deepest secrets with nobody the wiser. It gave me a sense of power, of being special… a feeling that I was different, that I saw the truth behind people's masks.

I was addicted to that feeling. I reached a point where I couldn't interact with anyone without taking a "peek" inside their head first. Know their intentions, know what they really thought of me. I started judging people based on their thoughts, not their words or actions. Sometimes I'd discover incredibly kind souls hidden inside, other times I'd crash into an indescribable amount of malice, spite, and hatred concealed behind fake smiles. It was like the internet, a vast ocean full of good and bad, but I focused more on the bad – it was more entertaining, more dramatic.

I know it's wrong. I know it's rude and a violation of privacy, but I couldn't resist. Like someone who discovers they can open any locked door – naturally, they'll try every door. I felt like the director watching the backstage chaos of life's daily play. Sometimes I used it to my advantage – figuring out what the professor would focus on in an exam, finding out if the girl I liked thought about me (which usually ended in disappointment), knowing if someone was trying to cheat me in a deal. But mostly, I used it for pure amusement. Like scrolling through Facebook and seeing people's scandals and problems, I did that live, directly from the source.

About a month ago, I started feeling a bit bored. All the thoughts became repetitive – same worries, same problems, same trivialities. I felt like someone watching the same movie every day. Until I met him.

I was at the Sadat metro station, crowded as usual, the air thick with the smell of sweat, cheap perfume, and cigarette smoke. While waiting for the train, I noticed a man standing a bit off to the side, alone. He looked completely ordinary, maybe a bit rugged. Worn-out jeans, a faded t-shirt, sharp, typically Egyptian features, but nothing particularly attention-grabbing. Maybe late thirties, early forties. He wasn't doing anything special, just standing there, looking towards the tunnel where the train arrives, like everyone else. But there was something strange about him, an aura of calm and intense focus amidst all the noise. People around him were shouting, talking, laughing, and he was completely oblivious, like he was in another world.

Curiosity killed me, as usual. I thought I'd just "take a look," see what this guy was thinking about. I focused on him, like I always do, like aiming a satellite dish to receive a specific channel. And in an instant, I was inside his head.

Oh my God.

The voice I heard inside my mind wasn't like any voice I'd heard before. There were no worries about work or problems at home or idle daydreams. There was… sharp focus, like a laser beam. And images. Images flashing by with terrifying speed. A dark alleyway. Hurried footsteps. Short, ragged breaths. Then… a muffled scream. Blood. So much blood.

I flinched, taking a step back. My heart was pounding. What was that? What did I just hear? I tried again, more cautiously this time.

The thoughts were clearer… and more horrifying. "Have to find him tonight… won't escape me again… must finish him… this filth needs to be cleaned up… his rotten stench fills the place… but where?… must focus…". These words repeated like a broken record, mixed with images of bloody violence, distorted faces, disgusting things I couldn't quite identify. But the constant theme was the determination to "cleanse," to "get rid of" something or someone he described with the foulest terms.

The train arrived, people pushed forward as usual. I saw him move calmly and board the train. A shiver ran down my spine. This man wasn't normal. These weren't the thoughts of an ordinary person. These were the thoughts of… a killer. Maybe a serial killer? The idea made my stomach churn. For the first time since discovering my "gift," I felt real fear. Fear not just for myself, but fear of what this man might do.

I got on the same train, standing a little distance away, but keeping my eyes on him. Every few minutes, I'd "peek" into his mind again. Same bloody thoughts, same terrifying focus. He was like a predator stalking its prey. Who was his prey? And why did he want to kill them so brutally?

"I have to watch him." That was the decision I made right then. A strange sense of responsibility suddenly fell upon me. I was the only one who knew what this man was thinking. I was the only one who could possibly stop him. Part of me was terrified and wanted to run as far away as possible, but the larger part – the curious part addicted to thrills, and the part that suddenly felt like a hero – was determined to see this through.

He got off at a station near downtown, and I followed him. He walked through side streets, his steps quick and steady. I followed cautiously, trying not to be noticed. He entered a small, dingy local cafe, sitting at a table in a dark corner by himself. I ordered something to drink and sat further away, pretending to read something on my phone, but all my focus was on him.

I entered his mind again. The thoughts were a bit calmer now, but still held the same intensity. "Getting closer… I can feel him… in this area… must be patient… he'll show up… has to show up to feed… hunger will expose him…". Feed? Feed on what? Or who? This talk was amplifying my terror. This man was definitely dangerously insane.

I continued to watch him over the following days. It turned into an obsession. I started skipping college, lying to my family, just so I could follow him. He moved around a lot, different areas in Cairo, always alone, always with the same deadly focus. I found out his name was "Aziz" – or at least, that's the name I heard someone call him once when he was buying something from a kiosk. In my head, I started calling him "Aziz the Ripper."

Every day, I felt closer to understanding his plan. He was looking for someone specific. Someone who moved around constantly. Someone Aziz was determined to find and kill. The thoughts I heard in his head were filled with details about this potential victim's habits, possible locations, ways to trap them. He described this person with disgusting terms: "the parasite," "the hidden one," "the carrion eater." I interpreted all of this as him trying to dehumanize his victim to make the act of killing easier, just like serial killers do.

I started painting a picture of this victim in my mind. Surely someone weak, alone, that's why Aziz chose them. Maybe homeless, maybe a loner. I began to feel pity for this unknown victim, and at the same time, rage towards Aziz. How could someone be this evil?

I reached a point where I knew where he was going before he even went there. I'd memorized his thought patterns and plans that well. And one day, I felt it – tonight was the night. His thoughts were all centered around one location: an old, forgotten cemetery on the outskirts of Cairo. An area known for being unsafe at night.

"Tonight… must finish him tonight… in his favorite place… among the dead, just like him… he won't escape… I'll corner him…". These thoughts were like gunshots in my head. I knew he intended to commit his crime there.

Fear gripped me and wouldn't let go. What should I do? Call the police? How would they believe me? Tell them I read minds and I know a guy is going to kill someone else in the cemetery? They'd think I was crazy and lock me up. No, I had to act myself. I had to stop him.

I went to the cemetery just before sunset. A gloomy, desolate place. Graves were broken and scattered, weeds and wild grass grew everywhere. The smell of dirt and decay hung heavy in the air. I hid behind a large, broken tombstone and waited. My heart felt like it would burst from fear and anticipation.

After about an hour, as darkness began to cloak the place, I spotted a figure approaching from a distance. It was Aziz. Walking with the same confident, steady steps. I quickly dove into his mind. "Close… very close… the scent is stronger… hungry… looking for easy prey… but I'll be the one waiting…".

Easy prey? Oh God, he wasn't just planning to kill his target, it seemed like he was looking for anyone else too! This man was far more dangerous than I had imagined.

A little later, I heard other footsteps approaching from a different direction. Light, cautious steps. I saw another silhouette drawing near, indistinct in the darkness. Aziz saw it too. His entire body tensed, like a lion spotting its quarry. I tuned into Aziz's mind again. "There he is… in the flesh… hiding in human form… but I see him… see his disgusting truth… tonight's your end, you son of a bitch…".

Hiding in human form? What did that mean? The words were strange. But I didn't dwell on it then, my only concern was that a life was about to be extinguished. The second figure got closer, and its features became slightly clearer. It was an old man, or looked like one, walking with a slight limp, clutching a black plastic bag. He looked so pathetic, like a beggar or some poor soul.

Aziz began to move slowly towards him, like a predator closing in. He pulled something long and thin from under his clothes; it glinted in the faint moonlight filtering through the clouds. It looked like a long metal spike or a very large switchblade.

This was it. He was going to do it. This poor old man was going to die right now. I couldn't stand it. I had to do something.

In a moment of madness, or maybe courage, or maybe stupidity, I burst out from behind the tombstone and screamed at the top of my lungs: "LOOK OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING???"

Aziz spun around, shock mixed with fury on his face. The old man also stopped and looked at me. For a second, time froze.

"You?! What the hell are you doing here, you idiot? Get back!" That was Aziz's voice, laced with warning and anger.

"I won't let you kill him! You murderer!" I yelled, moving towards him, not knowing what I intended to do – maybe hit him, maybe distract him until the old man could escape.

"Kill him? Kill who, you moron? You don't understand anything! Get away!" Aziz yelled at me again, but his eyes darted back to the old man, who was just standing there, watching us with a strange coldness.

And in the instant Aziz turned his attention to me, the old man moved. But it wasn't the movement of a limping old man. It was fast, terrifyingly fast, unnaturally fast. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Aziz.

And I heard a sound… a sickening crack. The sound of bones breaking. And I saw something I will never forget as long as I live. The old man's face began to… change. To stretch and contort. His eyes turned into burning red embers, his mouth opened impossibly wide, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth like nails. His thin, wrinkled hands became long, black claws. The plastic bag dropped from his grasp, and I heard the clatter of something hitting the ground… bones?

Aziz was trying to fight back, striking with the metal spike, but this… thing was much faster, much stronger. I heard Aziz scream, not in pain, no, but in rage and despair: "Ghoul!! You son of a ***! I knew it!!"

Ghoul? What did that mean? I was frozen solid, unable to move, unable to process what I was seeing. This wasn't a horror movie; this was real! The man I thought was a serial killer, the man I was trying to "save" a victim from… he was hunting a real monster! And the pathetic old man I intervened to protect… he was the monster!

This creature, this Ghoul, grabbed Aziz by the neck and lifted him into the air like a rag doll. Aziz was flailing, gasping for breath. His eyes met mine for a fraction of a second. I saw a look in them… not blame, not exactly, but despair and terror for my fate. As if saying: "See what you've done? You caused this!".

And then… with a sickening ripping sound, like wet cloth tearing… the Ghoul tore Aziz's head from his body.

Blood sprayed everywhere. Aziz's body crumpled to the ground like a heap of meat, his head landed a moment later, eyes still wide open, staring right at me.

I was still standing there, petrified, my mind refusing to believe it. Everything happened so fast. All those thoughts I'd heard in Aziz's head… "the filth," "the parasite," "hiding in human form," "his rotten stench," "must finish him"… none of it was a description of a human victim. It was a literal description of the terrifying entity standing before me now. Aziz wasn't a serial killer… he was a hunter. A Ghoul hunter. And I… I had killed him. With my stupid intervention, I had sentenced him to death.

The Ghoul casually tossed Aziz's head aside. And then… it turned towards me.

Oh, God. The look in its eyes. There was no anger, no human expression at all. There was… hunger. A cold, primal, absolute hunger. And a smile. A wide smile revealing all its pointed teeth, dripping thick, black, viscous saliva.

"You…" The voice that came out wasn't the old man's voice, wasn't even human. It was a deep, guttural rasp, like grinding stones. "…smell… good… like the hunter… but softer… you'll make… a… tasty… meal…"

In that instant, my legs started working on their own. Pure, unadulterated fear-adrenaline surged through me. I turned and started running. Running like a madman among the broken graves, unable to see clearly, the only thought in my head was to get away from this nightmare. Behind me, I heard heavy, fast footsteps, and the sound of the Ghoul's horrifying, rasping laughter.

"Won't… escape… me… I… smelled you… now…"

I kept running and running, I don't know how I got out of that cemetery and reached the street. I jumped into the first taxi I saw and screamed at the driver to just go, fast, anywhere far away from here. The driver kept glancing at me nervously in the rearview mirror; my face must have been deathly pale, my clothes covered in dirt, maybe even blood. I couldn't say anything, I was shaking too badly to form words.

I got out somewhere I didn't recognize and just wandered the streets like a lost soul, looking over my shoulder every few seconds, feeling like it was following me, feeling like it could see me. My mind kept replaying the image of Aziz's severed head, the image of the Ghoul smiling at me. It was my fault. I did this. If I had just let Aziz do his job, that monster would be dead now. But my curiosity, my ego, my false sense of heroism… they led to this.

I ended up in an internet cafe, sat here until morning. Ordered coffee, don't know how I drank it. My hands are still shaking. I started writing this post; someone has to know. Someone has to believe me.

I don't know what to do now. I killed the only person who could have protected me from that thing. And that Ghoul… it saw my face. It smelled me. It said it wouldn't forget me. It said I smelled good.

It's looking for me now, I'm sure of it. I can feel it. I feel its cold gaze on me even as I sit here among people in this cafe. Every face I see, I suspect it might be the Ghoul, hidden in another form. Every footstep behind me makes me jump.

I'm the new prey. The hunter is dead, and the monster is hungry.

I'm writing this, and my hands are trembling. I don't know what I'll do or where I'll go. I feel like my end is near. I hear footsteps outside the cafe… heavy steps… unnatural…

I have to stop now… I feel someone watching me from the window… its eyes… its eyes are red…

Oh God, help me… If anyone reads this… please… be careful… The monsters are among us… and don't believe everything you see or hear… even inside your own head…

Forgive me…

It's here… I see it… it's smil—
