Greetings. 

The following is a copy paste from an AskReddit post I commented in. Shortly thereafter, I learned of this subreddit and wanted to also share. 

The question: Do you believe in the paranormal (ghosts, demons, ect.) why or why not? 

Yes. Because I learned how to do a crossroads offering at a younger age. Being a nihilist and a bit of a sociopath, I was curious and wanted to face something. It was stated that a figure in black or a black animal would come.

So I waited on a full moon, at 3 am in a rural road where it’s not traveled often, and did it. Buried the container with my offerings for the ritual. I don’t aptly remember everything but I knew there were bones in that mix, from an animal. However I did bury it and waited. 

And 3:30 rolled around. 

All of a sudden, I see someone walking in a long gown of sorts. Pitch black. It’s a woman. And she’s walking to the intersection. Has a relaxed but steady cadence to her walk. I couldn’t make out many facial expressions but she seemed rather attractive at a glance, but there was some kind of veil over her face. She walked past me and I thought nothing of it until she stopped. 

I legit got scared when I looked back and her eyes seemed to reflect off the moon under the veil. 

Then she walked again in the same direction as intended. 

It’s said that you’re supposed to follow the entity to fulfill the contract and make a deal. Seeing how I wanted to know this creature and the reality of this dealing, I set out to make this occur. 

I checked my watch. 3:34. I looked back over and she was gone. Mind you, there was a clearing all around this intersection. You can see if people are coming from any direction. 

I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t have imagined it. I looked around but there was nothing. No people, animals walking about, no cars. Just me and the moon. 

I left in my truck and went home in a different direction, as the figure walked toward the direction I would normally take to go home. Took me a few extra minutes but I didn’t wanna chance it, actually. 

I rested my head in a weird fear. But was able to sleep. The dream shifted my ideals forever

I dreamed I was in this suspended animation. Floating yet falling at the same time. In front of me, I was float falling towards this swirling vortex of nothing. The fear I had was now insanely intense. For it felt like this darkness was staring back at me. And I called out to know if it had a name. When it did, shortly after it said 

“NOOO!”

I was frozen in bed, panting violently and sweaty. I cried. I pissed the bed. My body sore, especially my chest. Like something had clawed at me. 

I went to the bathroom to clean up and toss my boxers. In the shower, I finally noticed. Five distinct claw marks in the center of my torso. I looked at my hands and saw no skin or any sign of clawing myself. Then I tried contorting my hands to see if I could have. I couldn’t without moving my elbow way up past a limit in my rotator cuff. But still. 

After I cleaned up. I took to google and look up the name I was informed in my dream. 

I was speechless. 

His name was Zozo. According to what I looked up, he was the Keeper of Hells Gates. And he rejected me it seemed. There are times when that feeling looms upon me when i focus on people or groups of people. No matter what, it never has escaped me. And after, I was convinced of the existence that there is a hell. And I saw the entrance to its domain.
