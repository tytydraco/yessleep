I would always watch YouTube with my brother and we both loved hearing and watching scary videos or personal experiences that my parents or family members experienced when growing up since they all grew up in Mexico lots of unexplainable stuff happen. 

and scary videos were a bit hit in early 2016 and 2017 lots of people were dialing random numbers and them being creepy since there were movies that would say not to dial this number and you would just hear someone screaming or saying help or some numbers would just say out of service or just end the call. I would watch them on tv and on my iPad I never really had a phone since my parents didn't trust me or thought I wasn't of age to have one yet.

but I always persuaded them to buy me one since my brother had one I told them I can call people especially you guys to know if I'm doing well or call them in case of emergencies, so they obviously agreed. 

we went to the apple store and got it and once i turned it on i got so happy because you can do everything with an iPhone after having it for a while now i decided it was time to call 666 and so I did it would just tell me this is out of service or just end the call i did it a few times to see what would happen and nothing happened so out of boredom i just ignored it and since i was home alone all the time i would get scared from these videos but distract myself by playing video games or talking to my friends but this is a different situation since it was 7pm and it was already dark outside i got a call from my parents asking if i wanted McDonalds which i accepted after that call a few minutes later i went to the bathroom my phone was ringing and ringing i thought my parents were calling me so i hurried over to see i turned pale eyes wide opened my heart was racing like no other i got fucking chills down my spine the number 666 was calling me it was ringing there while i just stared at it.

i didn't pick up the phone because i thought the person who was calling me could trace my call or try to do something really scary but it stopped and it said call missed by 666 after a few minutes i decided to calm down i thought to myself it was just some dumb stuff but after giving it a good thinking and connecting the pieces how the fuck did this number call me even though every time i would call it always told me this number is no longer in service and i dont know since i had an iPhone i got another call but this time it was facetime from the number 666 at this point i didnt even feel scared instead i felt a sense of being curious WHICH WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE as soon as i answered i saw a dark room i covered my camera something was moving in the background of it but i couldn't see since the room was so dark he started saying my dad's name from soft to it becoming louder and louder someone was opening the door fuck that shit i ended the call i told my parents about this they didnt believe me until i tried showing them but the number was gone it just said unknown caller but they believed me they told me never to do that ever again because i was struggling to speak and being very scared they knew i did something that was scary or nerve-racking.

I told myself im never doing that shit ever again
