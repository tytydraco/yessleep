I couldn't have imagined that my life would take such a nightmarish turn. I’m trapped inside my apartment, separated from the world by an invisible barrier. I can see my neighbors come and go, knocking on my door and calling out to me, but they can’t hear my frantic screams. The days are stretching into weeks, and I fear that I will die in this prison, abandoned and forgotten.

My dreams are leaking. Every night I dream the same thing: I wake up in my apartment, but it’s different. A small hole in my bathroom wall calls to me. The voices that emerge from it are like twisted lullabies, sometimes whispering, sometimes snarling, and sometimes eerily echoing my own voice. The hole grows bit by bit every night.

Last night, the hole was finally large enough to crawl through. Desperation fueled my resolve, and with no other means of escape from my apartment-prison, I ventured into the unknown. Crawling through that pitch-black tunnel felt like an eternity, as if the walls were closing in on me, suffocating me.

When I emerged on the other side, I found myself in a place I could only describe as some form of greyzone. It bore an uncanny resemblance to the world I knew, yet everything was drained of color, shrouded in an oppressive gloom. The strangest part was the people - or rather, what appeared to be people.

I watched in horror as these beings practiced walking, their movements grotesque and unnatural, like alien infants wearing people-suits. Panic swelled within me, my chest tightening as I sought a place to hide from their unnerving presence. The suffocating dread became my constant companion in this twisted world, a miasma of terror that threatened to consume me whole.

As I traversed the grey landscape, I encountered other nightmarish creatures that seemed to defy all logic. Their twisted forms and haunting whispers filled me with a sense of unease that gnawed at my sanity. My grip on reality began to fray, my mind crumbling under the relentless torment of the greyzone.

Hiding in the shadows, I continued to observe the fake people as they mimicked human behavior. I soon realized that they weren't just imitating humanity; they were replacing it, one piece at a time. The implications of their sinister agenda sent shivers down my spine.

Desperation drove me to search for a way back to my own world, but the greyzone was a labyrinth with no discernible exit. The whispers of the siren-like voices from the hole followed me, their haunting melodies echoing through the colorless void. I could feel my strength waning, my body growing weaker with each passing day. I could no longer awake from this dream.

There was no sleep in the greyzone. Every time I closed my eyes, I was reminded of the isolation and despair that had become my constant companions. The weight of my predicament bore down on me, and eventually, I succumbed to the crushing exhaustion after what felt like days in the greyzone.

I awoke today, in a daze, disoriented and confused. But, alas, in my own bed. I never thought my apartment-prison would be a welcome site but compared to the greyzone it was an oasis, my bastion of sanity.

I stepped out of the bed and realized my legs were weak, as if I’ve slept for a week without nourishment. I made my way to the bathroom and froze. The hole, it is there. I’m awake and it’s here. I can no longer discern between dream or reality.

 I am convinced I am in hell.
