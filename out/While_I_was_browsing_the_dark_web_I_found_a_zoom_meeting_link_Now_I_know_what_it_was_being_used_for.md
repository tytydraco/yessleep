I sat in my bed, bored out of my mind. I suddenly came across a video on YouTube explaining how to get into the dark web safely. As the curious and bored 16-year-old boy I was, I immediately opened my laptop and started following the instructions. I downloaded a VPN and opened the Tor browser, thinking I was being smart.

After hours of attempting to get on the dark web, I finally managed to get in. I browsed for a very long time but didn’t spot anything creepy—just Netflix accounts, hacked Gmail and Facebook accounts, credit card details for sale, etc. I was about to sign off before I saw an anonymous account post what seemed like a Zoom link code. No username, no text—just the code.

I swiftly copied the code and pasted it into Zoom. The meeting was titled “встреча пользователя393024,” and it also said, “Host has joined. We will let them know you’re here.” I waited momentarily, then finally got accepted into the meeting.

There were a total of eight participants, all of them with their cameras off. People began typing things in the chat, such as, “When is it going to start? I'm getting bored LOL,” and “Yeah, hurry up, I am getting impatient XD.”

Then my camera suddenly turned on without me pressing any keys. I quickly covered it and attempted to leave the meeting, but it didn’t let me. My camera was now blocked with my finger.

**Shit... I forgot to cover my camera with tape**, I thought to myself.

Suddenly, a user named “пользователя393024” opened their camera. It was jet black at first before finally turning on. The video was very blurry and unclear—it seemed like an old phone. The phone focused on a couple of pictures, so I leaned in to look more closely since the quality was so bad.

I flinched back, my spine hitting the bed frame.

It was my little sister sleeping. A masked person was running their hands through her hair.

I immediately tried to call the police, but it went straight to voicemail: **“We are receiving several amounts of calls right now. Please try again later.”**

I jumped out of my chair and sprinted toward my sister’s room, which was upstairs. I busted through her door, but she wasn’t there.

My phone still wasn’t working. I couldn’t call my parents or anybody.

I walked back to my room, full of shame, and I suddenly spotted the meeting still ongoing. The participants were debating what to do with her.

**“Take a finger.” “Cut her tongue.” “Gouge her eyes out.”**

I felt tears running down my face. **“How can this be real... this isn’t real…”** I whispered to myself.

I started typing in the chat: **“If you touch her, I swear to God I won't let you stay alive. It’s either you let her go, or I will kill you myself.”**

I tried to scare them, but it didn’t work.

Out of nowhere, the camera suddenly focused on the background. It was a wall covered in rust, dirt, and many sketches and drawings.

The wall looked familiar.

It was the drawing my sister made on the garage wall when we first moved into the house.

I stumbled out of my chair and sprinted into the kitchen, grabbing a kitchen knife. I opened the garage door—and there she was, with the intruder. There was a low-quality camera streaming it all, and the intruder was holding a pocket knife.

With no time to think, I jumped on him, slicing his cheek as I did. He got up and stabbed me in the forearm. I growled in pain and frustration. Blood started running down my hands almost immediately.

That didn’t stop me.

I grabbed the intruder’s legs, making him fall and drop his weapon. I quickly picked it up and stabbed him in the neck, making him succumb to his injuries.

I smiled in relief. I looked at my sister, thinking I had saved her.

But it was too late.

She was lying face-first on the ground, blood streaming down her face.

I yelled in agony, knowing I had caused all of this, haunted by the times I promised to be the best big brother.
