It was always a tradition for my friends and I to go to our local campgrounds for a weekend in the fall. There were six of us total, my childhood friend Rob, our girlfriends Brenda and Lisa along with my friend Steven. Steven, last week gave me a call asking if his roommate Kevin could join us. Apparently Kevin had been more than a little burnt out working on a project and just needed to enjoy some fresh air in the great outdoors. 

Friday morning we all met at my parent’s house near campus and piled into Rob’s truck. I sat myself in the front seat and Rob wrapped his arm around my shoulder and shook me.

“Man, why the hell can’t we do this more often? Sure you guys have alot of on your plates, but c’mon I make time for y’all, just do the same for me every now and again.” 

“I have an eighteen credit hour course load between that and interning I basically have no life, don’t you try to call me out.” Steven retorted from the backseat sharply.

“Ha, come on Steve we can rest when we’re dead.” Kevin soothed as he went to light a cigarette.
The girls sat looking at us like we were idiots and I suppose we were.

“Kevin you smoke?” Brenda asked raising her brow.

“Just started, sorry I can wait till we’re out of the car if you want. I’ve just been sorta stressed, the Doc has me working day and night with this damn project…it’s been a little much for me.”

“Do what you gotta do, hell I couldn’t grind away at that shit every day.” Rob laughed.

We were off passing the numerous colorful trees. The mix of greens fading to yellows, oranges and reds always brightened my spirits. Kevin blared a kickass 90’s alternative playlist. It was an ideal start to the perfect weekend. 

“It seriously means the world to me that you all would take me along.” Kevin sighed taking a drag.

“No problem, I heard that project was following up on something Professor Elrichson found in Germany that predated Greece or something like that. Between that and Mid-terms it’s hard to believe you’re still standing” Lisa laughed

“Yeah…that rock is definitely something; my partners can take a crack at it. I’m not even touching that damn thing again.” 

Lisa turned her deep azure eyes to the window, “At least we all have our work behind us, it’s so beautiful out here.”

“Yup, it’ll be great to be back at the camp.” Rob smiled.

After about an hour drive we made it to Serenity Lake, which was really more of a pond, but the fact that it was serene could not be debated. The crisp clear water glistened, reflecting back all the warm colors of fall. We unpacked and setup our tents. Rob built up our bonfire with loose firewood I had gathered as the sun slowly set on the horizon. We sat surrounding the flames beer in hands reminiscing about the simpler times when we could be together every weekend. 

“Hey, Rob you know you would have done well in college. You’re not really as dumb as a rock and you had that football scholarship if I remember correctly, right?” Steven inquired as he prodded the fire with an iron poker.

“I guess I coulda if I wanted to, but ya know after my Dad’s accident last winter we jus have too many bills to pay. Man, after that fall he’d be hard pressed to even walk again.” Rob sighed as Brenda wrapped her arm around him. 

Next to me Lisa’s teeth began to chatter. It was getting pretty cold, unseasonably cold. 
“I think we ought to call it a night its getting pretty chilly out here.” I said

“Ya, I hear you man, freakin freezing out here.” Kevin shivered. 

As we all went to our tents for the night I looked up as snow began to fall to the ground. The temperature continued to fall throughout the night, luckily we had packed insolated blankets but it was a far chillier night than the weather had predicted. 

When we emerged from our tents the next morning we stepped out into over a foot of snow.
“Did any of you guys think to check the weather before this trip?” Brenda breathed out through clenched teeth. 

“Yeah, it said the low was supposed to be near fifty with clear skies all weekend.” I responded as I looked up at the oppressive grey that loomed overhead.

“Hey, you guys check this out!” Kevin called 
We followed his voice all the way to the pond, which had frozen over during the night. 

“Th-is is some crazy shit man.” Kevin chattered as he shook, then suddenly he was pulled directly into the icy water. We ran up to where he stood near the water.

“What the hell man?!” Rob yelled “I gotta go in for him!”
Steven put his arm in front of Rob, “Don’t be a fool you will get hypothermia within minutes if you jump into that water.”

Tears ran down my face as Lisa held me. We stared helplessly into the inky black depths of the water. As we walked away I heard a crack like thunder from the icy pond but, as I turned my head to get a better view nothing was there.

“We need to get out of here.” Lisa said squeezing me closer, I nodded.  Rob ran ahead to his car.

“Holy shit dude, there’s gotta be a couple inches of solid ice holdin all my tires down.” Rob called; he had cleared the snow near the tires. It was clear that there was no getting the truck to move.

“My God, what in the actual hell is going on?” Steven whispered putting his hands to his temples.

“Rob, can you go look for some wood? T-the fire is dying down.”  Brenda stammered.

“Alright, Lisa and I are going to go look for anyone else who might be camping for some help. Brenda try to call someone. Steven go help Rob gather some firewood, but we need to get the hell out of here.” I cut in.

Lisa and I started walking around the pond, making sure to keep our distance from the icy waters. Looking around the blanketed landscape the only discernable remnants of life were leaves shriveled and turned an ashy brown overnight. The near desolate wasteland of a forest let frigid winds cut through it, setting in a chill that froze me straight to the bone.

We eventually made our way to another camp, or at least what remained of another camp. The tents, sleeping bags, snacks and the like lay strewn everywhere. As we approached we noticed they were splattered in deep crimson. One of the overturned tents shook steadily, and a raspy wheeze, like struggled breathing could be heard inside. I made my way for it; Lisa grabbed my arm and shook her head. Yet some otherworldly curiosity bayed me onward.  Lisa stood at a distance as I moved aside the flap of the tent. Inside was a scarlet horror beyond my most terrifying of nightmares. Limbs and organs scattered all over the interior of the tent, a torso with head attached struggled for breath. Evidently the cold had frozen his wounds shut and his wild eyes met mine. 

“So cold…so cold warm me up please….please god, so cold.” what remained of his body twitched and squirmed as the embers of life left that poor soul. I stood frozen in terror for a moment before falling back out of the tent.

“Wha-what was it?” Lisa questioned, putting her hands on my shoulders and she caught a glimpse of the ravaged horror the tent had hid. She pulled me up from the snow and in a mad panic we ran back to our campsite.

Brenda lept from her seat next to the embers of the fire as she heard our scrambled approach, half crazed we told her of the killing at the other camp.

“Jesus Christ we need to get help, but there’s no service out here, a-and Rob still hasn’t come back please we have to find him.” Brenda sobbed.
 We set off, yet in my heart I feared the worst and after an hour of searching my fears came to fruition.

Rob was a Rorschach of bright red on the white canvas of the forest floor, twisted and mangled amidst the found.  Brenda collapsed, we carried her and some of the firewood back to camp as night fell once more. 

I held Lisa close to me as we sat near the roaring flames that stung my nose with notes of iron. Her teeth chattering madly in the cold.

“Are we…are we going to die out here?” Her mandible music continued, when suddenly out of the snow a pale white shape tore her out of my arms to the ground.

“Lisa!” I screamed running after the beasts as it dragged my beloved farther and farther from me. By the time I reached her the thing was gone and the deed had been done. I held my Lisa close, her eyes still haunt me, the beautiful blue flash frozen white by her attacker. I wailed out to the bleak black heavens, begging the beast to take me too. In my crazed state I made my way back to the camp, hearing sound of Brenda’s screams. I cannot let that damnable thing live.

Our camp was a wreck, Brenda had struggled but she had met the same terrible end as all of our other friends. I sat near the remaining flames, waiting for the beast. It did not come till the darkest coldest hours of the night when my teeth began to chatter. I closed my mouth, yet still heard the chattering, from behind me… 

I sprung to my feet and got to the opposite side of the fire. Where I had been sitting now loomed a great slouching, pale hairless figure. Its most disturbing feature was its face, if it could be called a face. The head and upper body in its entirety was a great chattering maul with articulated, fanged teeth. It raised long whip-like arms revealing that in the stead of hands were similar fanged atrocities chattering away with the same rhythm as my heart beat. 
We both slowly circled the fire, its eyeless gaze following my every move. Suddenly it dove over the fire at me; I grabbed the poker from the fire in an instant and the abomination had impaled itself on the searing hot metal. With all of my might I forced the thing off of me and its body faded into the snow.
I know not what transpired after that, but I am told that the police came to our camp the next morning. I was nearly frozen to death in the wake of that great crimson horror show, of which I was the prime suspect.

For hours on end the only thing that I would say was “the chattering white” over and over again. After I regained my senses I told the officials what had happen. Days later I was institutionalized. 

An inspector Salvador had taken particular interest in my case. He was one of the first on the scene after the reports had arrived about the “Serenity Lake Tragedy”. Our first interviews together were very hostile. He would demand a confession, grill me for the details of what really happened to my friends, how it made me feel when I killed them, anything to try to get a rise out of me. After weeks of this he had come again one day, a shaken shell of himself. There were deep circles around his bloodshot eyes, Salvador stared down blankly. 

“Well, what the hell is going on in that damn head of yours?” I growled.

“It can’t be you.” He responded quietly.
 I paused and tilted my head staring into his eyes, they were transfixed on a folder he had set on the table. The manila color was a rainbow in contrast to the concrete hell of Weeping Pines Asylum.

“Our forensics report just came in for another several murders, all with the same sadistic style as those in your case. They…they were all my fellow officers who found you that day. Since a couple days ago I-I’ve been seeing something. A pale figure just out of the corner of my eye, when I turn to get a good look at it, nothing. Some of my friends...th-they said they saw it too.” He stuttered his hand shakily tapping the folder.  “I’ve moved out of my house into a hotel for my family’s sake; tell me please what is it, what can I do?” Salvador whispered, tears running down his face. 

“Keep warm, I think the sound of chattering teeth cause it to attack. Maybe if you’re lucky it will move on like it did for me.” I said looking down at my hands, they still shake from time to time, the cold never really left me.

Several nights later I had a dream like many others before. It was night in a plain white hotel room, inspector Salvador laid in the queen sized bed with the blankets wrapped tightly around him. I could see in the moonlight that beamed through the large balcony window. He was clutching a King James Bible, given all he has been through I can’t blame him. The ceiling appeared to be writhing. Then the abomination peered its head down, close to the investigator’s head. Its long serpentine torso seemed was lined nostril like holes exhaling an otherworldly fog. 

As the beast brought both of its mouthed appendages toward the inspector, he shivered in the blankets. It then retreated back to the wall and began to twitch and contort violently. Its head split open even wider and expelled a bile enveloped form onto the ground. It twitched rigidly and took human shape as the window slowly became glazed over with frost.

“Daddy, I’m so, so cold daddy why am I so cold where are you?” The shape called out, it had taken the form of a girl in a nightgown.

“Daddy, why is it cold? I’m so cold.” The detective stirred and once he had opened his eyes and saw the girl at the end of his bed he sprung to embrace her.

“Honey, how did you get here?! What’s going on, where is your Mommy sweetheart?” A mist was coming off of the girl like dry ice.

“We’re here for you now Daddy you’re so warm, please warm me up. I’m freezing.” Tears streamed down the inspector’s eyes.

“Damn you…damn you….you, you son of a bitch.” He whimpered, dozens of holes opened up on the palms of the girls hands and all up her arms, hooked teeth pushed through them, latched on to the inspector’s back again and again lashing tearing whole chunks of flesh from his bones.

“So warm Daddy, you’re so warm.” She repeated, as her body split open into numerous fanged tendrils coiling around him. His lips were pale as snow, barely holding onto consciousness as mixture of blood loss and hypothermia set in. His jaw shook, ivories ringing out a final surrender to the horror that hung on the wall. As it descended upon the twisted mass I jolted awake screaming.

The investigator never came for another interview; two days later while I was in the recreation room of the asylum a news story covering the deaths of the detective’s family came on. The murders occurred on the same night, the mother and daughter in the family home and the investigator in the same room as my dream.  This macabre mockery it puts me through has to end. When I close my eyes all I see is death and god help me this cold has clung to my very soul. It will not let go of me. 

Last night my cell was frigid beyond belief my teeth began to chatter and I could not stop them. So I tore the upholstery from my room apart and with a splinter that I broke off from the pencil with which I was allowed to write sewed my mouth shut. 
The attendees had my rudimentary sewing job removed and bound me in a strait jacket. Tonight I could not stop my chattering, the great pale beast fell from my ceiling seemingly out of nowhere. One of its Fanged appendages liberated me of my bindings. It now looms behind me, waiting as I write my last words. So that I may tell not my story, but its story, for as I knew it, it knew me and as you know it, it knows you. All we have to look forward to now, is that last warm bath of blood before cold oblivion consumes us. I leave you with a gift of advice, if you feel a chill in the dead of night hold your mouth shut for fear of the Chattering White. There is a commotion ringing outside of my door and something more horrid behind me.

The sound is paralyzing, that labored wreching as if it was forcing out its innards with each breath it took, the cold grows ever closer and the room falls silent. I struggle and turn my head, it is so close now and my mind screams for me to move. 
My hands I can’t stop, my hands.
Her… her head in her hands, forced from that blasphemous maul, teeth a vacuous pit and three words, three words blood from everywhere, those three words….
