You may have heard the odd rumour at school or work, the grumblings of a stubborn pensioner, or the ramblings of a drunkard at the bar, but only and handful of people really know what goes on at Tidewell Testing Facility. After twelve years here, I'm now one of them. What I share with you today, I do so with best intentions at heart. My name is Dr. Nathan Calver, and I'm going to tell you everything I know about 'Nell'.

A little background, if you will. The Tidewell Testing Facility is, not to beat around the bush, a Top Secret government facility built decades ago in the early 80's on the outskirts of the fishing town of Longlillard. I'm a born and bred local, having grown up a mere 20 minute bike ride away. As a child, I'd always wondered what secrets lay hidden inside the hulking concrete structure.

The facility itself was built on an old housing estate, with a number of homes being demolished and families relocated to make way. Naturally this caused a lot of anger and strife among the locals, but over the years the area became less desirable to live in and more and more residents simply upped and left, leaving their empty houses to fall into disrepair. The facility grew larger with time, expanding into the surrounding estate and swallowing up more empty shells of former homes, but eventually ceased, and became largely forgotten. No one really seemed to come or go, and the local area was mostly abandoned and unkempt. the Facility simply became part of the scenery.

The one noticeable feature, aside from its imposing nature, was that the lights still came on at night, the only lights remaining in a quarter-mile radius. The few lights still glowing nearby belonged to the last remaining locals who just never left. Every now and again I'd hear whispers about what they were doing in that concrete giant; hiding aliens, testing super-weapons deep underground, pumping pharmceutical compounds into the water systems.. These stories all likely originate from those oddball locals, however, it's often said that the truth is stranger than fiction, and I can tell you now, that none of those rumours are the truth.

Subject 01, or 'Nell', as it has affectionately come to be known by those dedicated to studying it, is the very first of a number of quarantined artefacts to have been locked down within the facility. These artefacts are brought to us from all over the world, the very furthest reaches of our government's sphere of influence. For the last twelve years I've studied the peculiar energies of said artefacts, from a century old worn out walking cane that seemingly imprints paranoia and ambitions of revenge temporarily onto the minds those who should grasp it, to a pencil that appears to hide itself when not being observed. 

I've only just learned about Nell. Nell is, in fact, a room. A room decorated just like a child's. Old fashioned indeed, minty green walls with bright white furnishings and scattered with toys all tidied away to their correct spots. A perfectly made, crisp, clean bed complete with a fuzzy brown teddy bear in the centre, dotty in pattern and completing the room with a mint chocolate chip ice-cream sort of essence. That's all I could see from where I stood, tucked away behind the impact-resistant safety glass and airtight reinforced security hatch at the observation point, the guard ensuring I stand no closer.

I looked on as a familiar jingling sound approached from behind me, and before I even turned around I knew who would be standing there.

"Calver." nodded Chance.

"Dr. Chance." I nodded back. "Busby, there's a good a boy."

Dr. Giles Chance is the big man in charge. A proud man, his presence demanding of a certain respect. At least it would've been had he not been my mentor and a father figure to me for the last however many years.

"You know Giles," I started, "I was mid way through my morning croissant before you dragged me up to- sorry, \*requested\* my immediate presence at this strange sector that I've previously never been to, deep within the bowels of this building with only this cheerful git for company, to look into what seems to be a bedroom out of Mary bloody Poppins. Bloody rude if you ask me!"

"Now now Nate, no need to take it out on Brattley," said Chance with a wry smile, gesturing towards the guard in grey. "He's only looking out for your best interests after all, which I believe means making it back safely to your beloved half-eaten croissant without further incident."

"Safely?!" I retorted. "He frogmarched me all the way here at gunpoint! My croissant was frightened, the pencil's gone into hiding \*again\*, and to top it off you walk around here with that viscious beast off the leash! Come here Buzzy-boy you little monster you!"

Busby, glued loyally to the leg of Dr Chance up to this point, came bounding over excitedly, only to pass right by me and deposit a reservior of slobber onto the thigh of Brattley, who sighed grumpily whilst standing to attention.

"Busby, heel." Commanded Chance, and Busby with a jingling of his collar flitted back around to his master once more. "At ease Brattley. You certainly know how to exaggerate don't you, Nate? Now, I apologise for the heavy handed measures, but you'll soon understand. There's more to your escort here than your simple refusal to part with your breakfast-" I may have taken that a bit too personally as I raised a brow. "-I've brought you here to brief you. You may have noticed the child's bedroom in quarantine here. You may have also noted the numerous security gates you passed through on the way."

He stepped over the observation window and peered in. "This room is Subject 01, also known as 'Nell'. It is the very reason this facility was built, indeed, the very reason it stands right here. She's incredibly volatile and she's soon going to be your responsibility."

I was taken somewhat aback. "My responsibility? You can't mean.. No wait, come again? She? Nell? You mean to say that Nell, the room, has an identity? And that she's dangerous?"

"Extremely." murmured Chance. The wry smile gone, replaced with a look of deep brooding concern, that which I'd never seen on his face before. To say I found it unsettling is an understatement. The following pause felt like a lifetime.

"You see," continued Chance, briefly looking down before looking back towards Nell. "'Nell' is the name we use to refer to Subject 01, but in actuality, it's the name of a young girl who disappeared many years ago. Little is known of the events that took place that day. All we know for sure, from various witness accounts, is that something unprecedented within the realms of human experience occured, and that Nell and her bedroom at Tidewell Cottage, 3 Melling Rise, were at the absolute crux of it. We've come to refer to it as 'the Shift'. The event was of great interest to our friends in grey, isn't that right Brattley? Well, don't answer that. They had the place locked down most rapidly, and the Tidewell testing facility popped up almost overnight, though not in the same capacity you know it today. The room you're looking upon right now, is the very room in which the epicenter of the shift occured. Everything you see inside is precisely as it was that night in May 1983."

I stood listening intently. The mention of that little girl had me on edge. What was so volatile and dangerous that it required an armed guard to escort me? Could it be Nell, the little girl that disappeared?

"Giles," I spoke at last. "What is the shift, exactly? Is it the girl? Is she behind this?"

"I don't know, truth be told. I've been researching this since day one. There have been several expeditions into the room over the years to try and gather information, clues, anything that might indicate the girl's whereabouts, or help us understand the phenomenon that started it all. I've sent several men directly to their deaths, I fear."

That was an interesting way to phrase it. "You mean to say, you don't actually know what happened to them?"

"Some, yes. Some have entered and walked out completely unaffected. Others have reported strange side affects. One was quarantined for fourteen weeks before he died; what happened to him bears down terribly on my conscience. On the very last expedition some 9 years ago, I'd sent in a team of four to investigate an anomaly. One of the researchers under me at the time came to see me urgently, nervous and shaking. He'd noticed a small inconsistency within the room. The Teddy bear, that very one you see now-" He tapped faintly on the glass towards the teddy bear, approximately 15 metres from where we stood. "-That bear was facing directly at him. He didn't see it change, he simply noticed it wasn't in it's usual position. What happened when that team entered is something I will never forget."

I shuddered. "So.. what happened in there, Dr Chance?" I asked carefully.

"Nothing. Truly nothing. The monitoring terminal showed no sign of energetic interference." Explained Dr Chance. "But the bloodcurdling screams over the radio when they saw whatever they saw will haunt me for the rest of my days. One of them began to fire their weapon, while the Team Leader stood there screaming, falling to his knees. The other two attempted to retreat. One made it back to the hatch, but the other froze mid-stride, directly in the eyeline of the bear. It was like a freezeframe, she was locked perfectly in place, not a single twitch from her as she slowly redshifted and eventually faded away completely."

"Redshifted?" I interjected. "As in the shifting-

"-Of the colour spectrum into the reds, observed in the most distant galaxies as they speed ever-faster out of our reach?" Said Chance, finishing off my question. "The very same."

"And.. the one who made it to the hatch?" I asked uncomfortably.

"He's standing behind you." Nodded Chance almost over my shoulder.

I spun around to face the man who had escaped unharmed. Brattley was standing easy at his post, ever loyal, ever ready to react. His dark grey military style get up suddenly all the more prominent in my eyes, in particular the dark grey beret displaying a peculiar badge; a black circular background with simply two red dots, horizontal to each other. I was about to take him a lot more seriously. At least I would have had it not been for the anxiety in my stomach forcing me to make inappropriate comic dialogue, my usual and most unfortunate coping mechanism.

"Well, remind me never to work with you, Brattley. Last thing I want to do is die screaming next to you." I said with an awkward chuckle.

His eyes darted straight at me, looked me up and down, and with a single disparaging grunt returned to their original position.

"Nathan," Said Chance, "I'm-

"-What about the other one?" I accidentally interrupted. "The one firing his-

"Dr. Calver." Said Chance authoratively, stopping me in my tracks.

"I'm telling you this," He continued, reaching into his lab coat pocket, pulling a small silver pocket watch into view and studying it a while. "I'm telling you all this, because I'm going away. Retiring, in fact. For good." He pocketed the watch again. "I'm handing it over to you, Nate. I need you to continue our research, and protect our colleagues, and beyond."

"You're retiring?" I said, stunned. "Bu.. whe.. Well I knew it was coming some day, you old codger. I'm pleased for you. But Giles.. me? This is far more than anything I'm qualified for. I deal with fidgety umbrellas, hungry antique clothes wringers and things that go 'bump' in the day. Nothing that actually \*wants\* to kill me, let alone others."

"You have an excellent record, you have the knowledge and experience. You essentially know inside-out the job I'm giving you already." reasoned Chance. "I'm passing it to you with the knowledge and peace of mind that once I'm gone, everyone and everything will be in safe, capable hands. Besides, Nell's been dormant for the last 9 years. Why would anything change now?"

That leads me to where we are in this moment. It's Chance's last day tomorrow. Despite my protests, I've spent the last two months prepping to take over from him. He even gave me his silver pocket watch, saying I'd be needing it. It'd probably come in handy if it actually worked. I'm becoming more accustomed to the responsibility, too, though I have my reservations about it. For one, Chance has been prepping for some kind of expedition, the first in 9 years. It doesn't seem to be anything major, just a simple monitoring within the chamber from outside the room itself. I believe he wants to understand the distance at which the interference begins, in an attempt to understand why the decade long dormancy, and perhaps to see if the interference-affected zone itself is subject to change. He's had a few of the Greys put through rigourous training, getting them used to the monitoring equipment they'll be taking inside. His experience outweighs mine by nearly 28 years, but I must say I categorically hate the idea of even breaking quarantine. That, and the mere thought of the girl, Nell, sends chills down my spine.

They're going to put the plan into action today, in little over an hour's time. I'm going to be observing it. Take it as a warning from me, dangerous forces are at play. Knowing what I know now, my conscience won't allow me to continue without asking you to, please, stay well away from the facility. If  you live in or around Longlillard, if you see anything unusual in the coming days, do not investigate. Leave the area immediately and carefully remove yourself to a safe place. Do not to add to the disturbance. If you have any family in the area, make sure they heed these warnings too.

Well, I'm going to start making my way over to the monitoring station. I'll be expected to

Woah the alarms, they're sounding! It's too early for the expedition, something really isn't right here! It could be an unauthorised breach of the quarantine chamber - I've got to go! stay safe, I hope I'll be updating you in the near future!
