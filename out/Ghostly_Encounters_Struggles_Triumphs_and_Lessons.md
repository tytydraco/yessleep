Recently, something extraordinary happened to me - I experienced multiple episodes of sleep paralysis, commonly known as ghostly encounters.  
  
During the first occurrence, I felt my body being pinned down by an unseen force. I quickly sensed a loss of control over my body. I attempted to push it away with my hands, but in reality, my physical body remained still while I tried to use my mental strength to push it away. Eventually, I managed to exert enough force and successfully pushed it away. In that moment, I believed I had overcome it, and a sense of triumph engulfed me. I felt invincible, thinking I could easily conquer any future episodes of sleep paralysis. (It was already 8 or 9 in the morning, and I didn't want to get out of bed as I had only fallen asleep around 3 am. Despite feeling great and triumphant about easily defeating the sleep paralysis entity.)  
  
The second occurrence triggered my arrogance, and I began to insult and provoke the entity in my thoughts. I mentally challenged it, saying things like, "Come on, bring it on! Come and get me, you coward!" Shortly after, I felt that same unseen force pressing down on me again, and my body started to feel heavy and uncontrollable. I struggled to break free from its grip, finding it increasingly difficult. I began reciting Buddhist mantras, and suddenly, I regained control over my body. This only fueled my arrogance further. I started taunting the entity.  
  
  
In the subsequent episodes, I entered a semi-lucid dream state. I found myself in a dark environment, surrounded by unknown structures. I searched for the entity, thinking it would be more satisfying to have a weapon to fight back. To my surprise, a samurai sword appeared in my hand. I could see myself performing various sword movements with both hands gripping the hilt, executing vertical and horizontal slashes. It was unmistakably a samurai sword.  
  
Whenever I felt the force pressing down on me, I could see that I had found the entity. I viciously swung the sword while reciting Buddhist scriptures and mantras. It brought me great pleasure to witness the entity in agonizing pain as I attacked it. I believed that my actions were driving it away. I continued to wield the sword and search for the entity, using the sensation of being pinned down as an indication of its presence. I would then unleash my sword and recite the scriptures, driving it away and pursuing it relentlessly. I became addicted to this process as it brought me immense satisfaction.  
  
However, I started to notice that my strength was gradually diminishing. Each time I was pinned down, it became more challenging to regain control over my body. In the final encounter, I experienced a nocturnal emission, commonly known as a wet dream.  
  
The entity left, and I could sense its satisfaction.  
  
I felt puzzled as to why my later attempts to rely on the power of Buddhism failed to repel the entity. It then occurred to me that in the beginning, I chanted the mantras out of fear for self-preservation. However, in subsequent encounters, my mindset shifted to one of anger and resentment, fueled by negative thoughts. In those moments, I was connecting with the entity on its level rather than with the enlightened teachings of Buddhism. Furthermore, with each episode, my strength waned a little more.  
  
Lessons learned: Cultivate a deeper and more sincere practice of Buddhist mantras and compassion. Minimize exposure to social media to avoid deepening negative thoughts.  
  
Tactical approach for future encounters: I will attempt to bind the entity using a rope.
