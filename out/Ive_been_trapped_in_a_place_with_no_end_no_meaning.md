I have no clue how I got here, or where it even is. One minute I was going about my day as per usual, then everything just... stopped. There was no warning, no shift. It's not as if I had fallen asleep or blacked out... or at least I don't think I had. 



The first thing I noticed was the silence. But something felt off. it wasn't the type of quiet you'd usually experience when you're alone. This was different. Suffocating almost, as if the absence of sound had weight. I couldn't hear my breath, feel my heartbeat, it was like all of reality had melted away, leaving only nothing.



I tried to move. Reach out, fully expecting to feel something, anything. my hand cut through the air, grasping at nothing. No floor, no walls, no sky. It was all gone, everything that had ever existed erased in the blink of an eye. Left in its place was a vast endless void infinitely spanning across all that once was. I tried to speak. I opened my mouth, but no sound came. My voice, my body, was being swallowed by whatever this place was. Is this hell? 



I started to panic. I screamed as hard as physically possible, but only silence followed. The type of silence that feels like it's mocking you, as if the very absence of sound was a reminder of your insignificance. I screamed again, louder this time. Begging for anything, anyone. I had no clue what was happening or where I was. All I knew is I had to escape. Go somewhere. Anywhere.



I tried moving, but the more I thrashed around the clearer it became that there was direction to this place. No way to tell up from down, left from right. No inertia. Was I standing? Floating? I couldn't tell anymore. I didn't even know if I was still me. Did I have a body? A past? I once thought so. But now that started to feel like a distant memory. All that was left was a dreadful emptiness. The longer I remained here the more I felt I was becoming hollowed out. As if this place was feeding on me, consuming all that I once was. Leaving nothing but a vague notion of existence. Was I even alive anymore?



With each passing moment I could feel myself slip further and further away. I was dissolving, becoming one with the void.



Please... I thought. Oh God please, let this be a dream. But no matter how hard I tried I knew it was futile. There was no escape. No hope of returning home. Wherever that was.



No, it can't end like this. I have to try even if it's useless. I can't just give up and let myself be erased. At Least not without a fight. I started screaming louder, thrashing harder. It felt like it went on for days weeks even. I honestly couldn't tell anymore. Did it even matter?



No matter what I did or how hard I tried, there was really nothing I could do. I was completely trapped here. Alone.



That's when the realization hit. Am I even real anymore? Was I ever real? These thoughts began clawing at my mind. Tearing away what was left of my sanity. Was I a person once? Or have I always been this... this thing. 



As these thoughts slowly faded a new one surfaced. How long have I been here? It had to have been several months at this point, maybe even years. Time has lost all meaning here. There was no sense of it. No passing moments. It was just this. This was all that was left. 



And yet even now, after everything. I still find myself hoping. Hoping for something to break through the void. I Hope someone will eventually hear me. Maybe I'll wake up, or find someone else. But I know the truth now.



There's no one. No answer. Only me. The void. And the symphony of silence. 



I've completely forgotten what it was like before—what it felt like to be alive. What it felt like to be me. To be loved. I—I don't know if I should feel relieved or terrified. Maybe it's always been like this. Maybe I never was



If anyone can hear me, if anyone is out there... please. Just please let me know I'm not alone. Tell me I'm not the only one.



Please….
