Before you say anything, I know that’s a phony name to give a serial killer.

“West Hook Ripper” sounds like a punchline that didn’t land, but for myself and the people in my town, the name instilled deep, profound terror.

I was in my final year of college when I first heard about it. Or read it, actually. It was on the front page of my city’s main newspaper.

The victim, Sarah, was a student at my college. She was found ripped apart by what the police believed was a hook. She was the seventh body discovered with the same pattern.

A smart-ass journalist gave him the name “West Hook Ripper,” inspired by his weapon of choice and the fact that he targeted the city’s west side, where most universities were.

The panic on campus was indescribable. My boyfriend, Greg, and I participated in many protests demanding better student safety and more action from the authorities. Greg even organized a few; he was head of the student council.

But it didn’t help much.

The last student to disappear was Ananya, a shy Indian grad student in computer science. I used to see her regularly on the bus when we both lived in the same suburban neighborhood, about 70 miles from the city center. We’d chat on the way to class.

I stopped seeing her after I moved out of my parent's house into town with Greg. Her body at the time was yet to be found, so there was hope.

Greg was also in his final year, studying engineering. He had just landed a well-paying job at the airport, where he worked long hours. He was my first real boyfriend, and we were already talking about getting married after I graduated.

We were in his pickup truck the night it happened. The truck was old and smelled bad—his father’s gift to him.

It was late at night, Super Bowl Sunday. We’d had a few beers and accidentally napped at my parent's house. When we woke up, it was past eleven, and I had classes early the next day. We decided to grab some coffee and head home—a stupid decision that my drunk father didn’t contest.

On the drive back, Greg noticed the gas was running low. The station we usually stopped at was closed. A quick Google search pointed us to an open station nearby, but it was along a sketchy side road. Greg said he knew the path and took the entry to it. We had no choice.

The road was desolate and dark, with no other cars or lights. We wondered what kind of gas station would operate in such an isolated place.

It took us fifteen minutes but when we arrived, it was exactly what you’d expect. The station looked abandoned, with faded signs and crumbling walls. The store in it had rows of empty shelves, except for a few Doritos and gum.

We both got out of the truck because I desperately needed to pee. The beers were catching up to me.

The clerk looked like a cliché—a beer-bellied man with a receding hairline. Creepy. 

He didn’t say hi or make eye contact, just sat there reading a magazine.

Greg, in a hurry, told me to use the bathroom quickly. He informed the clerk of the pump number and went outside to fill the tank.

As I walked to the bathroom, I noticed the clerk put down his magazine. He was staring at Greg through the window. Then he turned to me, his gaze lingering.

His look gave me chills. I hurried to the bathroom, did what I had to do, and left as fast as I could.

When I came back, he wasn’t even pretending not to stare. His pale, wide eyes followed me as I got into the truck and told Greg to leave immediately. Luckily, Greg had already paid, and we drove off.

The encounter seemed unsettling but harmless—until we noticed the black SUV. 

It appeared behind us, suddenly. Headlights off, creeping closer. My body tensed in a way it never had before. Greg panicked and floored the gas, pushing the old truck to its limit. We hit nearly 130 mph, but the SUV stayed calmly behind us. Then its high beams flashed on.

The next moments were a blur. I remember seeing other black vehicles joining in. I remember hearing the helicopter. The buzzing. I don’t remember the crash into the cornfield, but I’ll never forget how it felt—my broken nose, my lost tooth.

I woke up covered in blood, still in the truck.

The cops pulled me out and into an ambulance. Greg was gone.

They searched for him for days, using dogs and helicopters. At the time, they found no trace of him, and he is technically still a fugitive.

Later, I learned that part of Ananya’s body was still in the truck bed, wrapped in a sack. The stench wasn’t just from the truck being old. The killer's signature hook was also found in a tool container—stolen from the airport, where he worked.

He had used his position as student council president to earn trust, offering rides to his victims before drugging, assaulting, and murdering them.

The clerk had alerted the police while I was still in the bathroom, recognizing the car as the only one repeatedly seen late at night on that road. I didn’t know at the time that area was Greg’s dumping ground for many of his victims.

For me, the most haunting discovery was under the driver’s seat—a box containing a newly bought wedding ring. A friend of his later told me he would propose to me at my birthday. 

I was inconsolable and confuse for a long, long time. I still don’t understand why he killed those girls and not me. Why I got the ring, and they got the hook.

These are questions I may never have answers to. Or maybe I will. He’s still out there.
