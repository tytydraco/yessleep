I was 14 when I first noticed the delay. Brushing my hair and teeth, doing my mascara and lip gloss, and washing my face. In the mirror in front of me there was always a delay. 

I thought I was crazy. A delay in my own reflection? Really? But once I saw it I couldn't unsee it. I could've sworn that with every movement my reflection had a slight reaction time. I couldn't ignore it. 

As I got older she got better at it. She matched my movement almost perfectly. I tried to get other people to see it but they always gave me a look of pity and fear. The worst of it was my sister, Lila. God, the look she gave me. It didn't matter anyways did it? My reflection didn't hurt me. 

But I swear, when I walked past the shops outside she'd walk a bit slower than me in the glass pane. Her footsteps didn't match with mine very well. I ignored it as best I could. When I was 26, she finally slipped. 

I was carrying my full-length mirror up the driveway to the new house. After a misstep I fell, and with me the mirror. 

We yelped. 

I ignored the pain and scrambled up to look. For a split second I saw her cover her mouth in surprise before matching my horrified stare. 

That was it. I couldn't deal with it. I really couldn't. Everytime I'd tried to make her slip up she never did, but the *one time* I finally caught her, the one time I had her within my grasp there was nobody there to see it. No, I needed her out of my life, out of my house. 

So I demolished every mirror I owned, every reflective surface. I switched my smartphone for an old Nokia, I covered the windows, I did everything right. In the end you can't escape your own reflection. I saw her in the glass outside, in the water that pooled in my sink before disappearing down the drain, even in my sister. 

I avoided her as best I could. I got my pipes cleaned and stayed inside my house. Finally, Lila knocked on my door. 

"Cass, you have to let me in. I don't know what's going on with you but please just let me in. Whatever it is we can fix it." 

I could barely get myself to unlock my front door while looking down at my own shoes. I could feel her eyes on me and I knew she still had that fucking look on her face. 

"Lila I really can't do this right now. Come back another time." 

I was just about to close the door when she wedged her foot in the gap. 

"Fuck, Cass. What is going on with you? I'm not going.", she said and pushed her way past me. I didn't bother resisting and followed her into the house, keeping my eyes glued to the floor. 

"Look, you know you can talk to me right? I'm your day one. What happened?" She asked, her voice desperate. I didn't reply, too scared to look at her. Her face was too similar to mine, too similar to hers. 

Before I could react she grabbed my face and forced me to look at her. When I saw it I screamed. She jumped back and stared at me in surprise. 

"I can't do this anymore. I..I have to go." She said before sprinting out of my house. Before I could even process what happened I felt a familiar lump in my throat. 

I started sobbing and throwing stuff around. My face was hot with anger. When I turned my head I saw my glass panes covered and ripped the tarp off of them. 

"THIS IS ALL YOUR FUCKING FAULT! ALL OF IT! TELL ME WHY!", I screamed. When I finally got the tarp off and looked I immediately staggered back in horror. 

My reflection wasn't there. It wasn't there. Where was she?

As if in a holy revelation the answer came to me.

I grabbed a steak knife from my kitchen and sprinted out of my house. When I got outside 'Lila' was unlocking her car door. I was on her in an instant. 

She screamed when I tackled her to the ground, and with each new wound she let out a choked sob. I couldn't care less. She'd made my life a living hell. Made me live in constant fear. 

She grabbed at me aimlessly while I swung my knife, each time it plunged deep into her torso. We were both covered in red and it erupted from her mouth before her body relaxed. I was finally free. 

I got off of her and smiled in triumph before I caught the eyes of my neighbors. They stared in shock and terror. A mans hand shook as he was on the phone, explaining what had just happened. I looked between them helplessly before looking down at my sisters bloodsoaked body. Her eyes were still red and teary.

For a moment I could've sworn I saw my reflection in them smile before matching my horrified expression.
