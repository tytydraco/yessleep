Something is terribly wrong with my town. For starters, it doesn’t exist. Not legitimately anyway. In fact, I’m not sure what – or who – is real anymore. Nothing makes sense. But I’ll tell my story as best I can. There’s not much time. And I may be in danger.
 
My name is Jordan Tramp. Um, at least, I think that’s my name. It changes sometimes. So does this godforsaken town. Let me explain:
 
I started noticing how peculiar my town was earlier this year – whatever year it is, I can’t be certain – but I suppose I’ve always suspected. For starters, everyone dresses in gray. It’s weird. And nobody asks questions. Which is also weird. I didn’t notice until I stopped taking my morning Pill.
 
The Blue Pill.
 
Sometimes it’s Red.
 
Each day as we enter school, we’re administered the Pill. We gulp it down with the Orange Drink. Everyone complies. For some reason – maybe it’s because I’d just turned 16 and was concerned about my Initiation (more about that later), I forgot to swallow. Instead, I kept the pill tucked underneath my tongue, and shuffled off to class. 
 
An idea sprang to mind. Let’s see what happens if I don’t swallow the Blue Pill. It was a radical idea, but something made me do it. So, instead of swallowing, I spat it out, and crushed the Pill with my shoe. What came next can only be described as CLARITY.
 
There’s one school in this ungodly town; it’s a gray, windowless structure, and is kept cold, except in the summer when it’s hotter than a pizza oven. There are twenty-one teachers and roughly 600 students, ranging from kindergarten to grade twelve. Not only do we all dress the same, we all have the same last name. No one seems to care.
 
With my newly-found CLARITY, an outpouring of questions flooded my mind. Like, what school do I attend? Curious, I raised my hand and asked the teacher, Mr. Tramp, what the name of the school was.
 
The students gasped.
 
Mr. Tramp’s pale face tightened. He rubbed his balding head, “Trampville Academy, of course,” he said. Then he placed a large hand on my shoulder, and spoke in a wispy voice. “You feeling okay, Jordan?” 
 
I nodded, then removed his hand from my shoulder. All the kids were gazing at me, their milk-white faces expressionless.
 
“Good,” he said.
 
Mr. Tramp meandered to the front of the class, and continued his lecture. I tried listening, but couldn't make sense of it. Everything he said was nonsense, just smart-sounding words strung together meaninglessly. The other students sat shoulders slumped, with gaping mouths, as if everything was normal. 
 
During lunch break, we were herded into the cafeteria and fed a hapless meal of grey meat and green, goopy slop. I sat with Brit, my best friend – if it’s even possible to have best friends, I’m starting to have doubts. She asked me if everything was okay. I winced. She sounded just like Mr. Tramp.
 
“Yeah,” I said, shakily, “I mean, no.”
 
I was suddenly afraid. What kind of school was this? I regarded the cafeteria with suspicion; the kids sat like trained monkeys at a feeding trough, shoveling the unfortunate food into their faces. No sudden outbursts, no fits of laughter, just the sound of slurping and chewing and idle chatter. 

Cameras everywhere.
 
“Um, Brit, you ever wonder what’s going on?”
 
She wiped her auburn bangs from her ashen face, revealing her dark, enchanting eyes. She was beautiful. Why hadn’t I noticed before?
 
She shrugged, “I’m worried about you, Jordan.”
 
Confused and frustrated, I turned my attention to my lunch: the overcooked gray meat, the slippery green slosh. I gagged. The meat was tough as rope, the green goop jiggled, seemingly on its own. The food certainly didn’t seem nutritious. Nor did the tangy Orange Drink. 
 
“What is this stuff?” I asked Brit, forking my food.
 
“Meat.”
 
I didn’t like her response. Nor did I trust the faraway look in her big, brown eyes. Whatever they were feeding us, I realized, was suspect. Poison, perhaps, that slowly rots the brain. The cafeteria was lined with tables, each table boasted a game of Euchre. We joined in on a game. No one looked at me. Word must’ve gotten around that I’d asked a question. Questions were not permitted at Trampville Academy.
 
My stomach was gurgling, my head felt like a million knives were stabbing it. I felt sick. Probably withdrawal. How long had I been taking the Pills? Most of my life, probably.
 
Smartly, I kept my mouth shut for the rest of the day.
 
When I got home, my parents were waiting for me, arms crossed. Their faces suggested bad news. They were of average height, average build, and dressed in simple gray clothes. Like everyone else.
 
My mother’s bottom lip was trembling. “Jordan,” she said, not tenderly, “the school called. They said you were asking questions.”
 
My father shook his head disapprovingly, then led me to the living room. I sat on the nondescript sofa, in between my parents, close enough so that our shoulders were touching.
 
“Is anything wrong, son?” my father asked. He was a scrawny man, balding, with eyes like saucers.
 
“You know better than to ask questions,” Mom piped in.
 
My stomach gurgled. Whatever I ate at lunch wasn’t agreeing with me. I needed to relieve myself, but was too scared to say anything. Instead, I shook my head, fighting back a flood of tears. Suddenly, I felt ashamed. I don’t recall ever feeling so low. Truth be told, I don’t remember much of my life. It was like I’d woken up from a terrible dream, and didn’t know who or where I was.
 
“Is it the Initiation, son?” my father continued, speaking tonelessly. “Because that’s nothing to be afraid of.”
 
The Initiation! 
 
Somehow, I’d forgotten. I shrugged, not daring to speak. Suddenly, I was suspicious of everything and everyone.
 
“We should call your folks,” Mom told Dad.
 
“Of course,” he said. “That’ll set him straight. Too bad your parents are…” he stopped mid-sentence, and stared at his gray socks.
 
Mother looked away, her eyes were like glass bulbs, with nothing inside them. A memory came: my grandparents on my mom’s side disappeared last summer. They came down with a virus, and no one’s seen them since.  
 
“Come on son,” my father said. He stood up and stretched. “It’s time.”
 
He nodded towards the Basement.
 
My blood chilled. The Basement. Oh, how I hated the Basement. It’s damp and dark and dingy, and I have to crouch in order to avoid the low-hanging beams. Plus, there are things living down there. Nasty things.
 
“Afterwards, you can eat cake,” Mom said.
 
Hand in hand, they frogmarched me out of the living room, and into the bathroom. That’s where the Basement is. There’s an old trapdoor which leads downstairs. It takes all my strength to open it.
 
My feet threatened to disobey. My tongue felt huge. I don’t recall ever being so nervous. What’s there to be scared of? I asked myself. This is normal. Everyone gets Initiated. It’s what you do when you turn 16.
 
The Basement door creaked open. The smell of must and mold was pungent. The light bulb waited at the bottom of the rickety stairs, which were steep.
 
“Go on, son,” my father said, firmly.
 
I gulped. My heart was thumping irregularly underneath my gray sweater.    
 
“Go on, Jordy,” Mom snapped. “We haven't got all day.”
 
“Then you can eat cake,” Dad repeated.
 
I went. The darkness increased as I descended those dubious, wooden stairs. One of the stairs wobbled, and I nearly tripped. Why wasn’t there a handrail? And why wasn’t the light switch upstairs? Clearly, this was dangerous. The cold stare coming from my parents motivated me, so I continued my descent. Once I reached the bottom, I flicked on the switch. 

Pale light spilled across the drab, dirt floor. Shadows danced. Something squeaked. Probably, a rat. Rows of brown boxes were stacked haphazardly against the stone walls. Various unwanted appliances gathered cobwebs. An old sofa sat arbitrarily in the corner. It was gray. Something touched my shoulder; I jumped and smashed my head on the ceiling.
 
“Jordy!” said my mother, letting go of me. “Honestly, I don’t know what’s gotten into you today.”
 
I wiggled away from her. Claustrophobia arrived at once. Oh, how I hated the Basement. My parents regarded me, their eyes never blinking. My father told me to sit. I did. A smile threatened the corner of my mom’s mouth, as she produced a long, sharp needle from her purse.
 
“This will only hurt for a second.” She flicked the edge of the needle.

 Standing over me, my father swabbed my shoulder with alcohol. When I resisted, his grip tightened. My mother swooped in and stabbed me with the needle. I winced. It didn’t hurt much, but I was terribly annoyed. Immediately afterwards, my legs went wobbly, and my mind went in and out of focus. I felt nauseous. Father eased next to me on the sofa, and touched my forehead. His hands were clammy.
 
“Here.” He handed me a Pill. It was red. “Swallow this.” 
 
My mouth involuntarily opened, and I dry-swallowed the Pill.

  “Good boy.” Father stood up.
 
Just then, my grandparents arrived – my other grandparents, the ones who haven’t gone missing. Mom rushed upstairs and greeted them. I tried listening to what they were saying, but instead I passed out. But before doing so, I noticed something peculiar on the adjacent wall. A large stone was removed. Behind it was a tunnel. I wondered where it went. A pair of beady red eyes met mine. I cringed. Facing me was a giant, mutated centipede with helicopter-like antennas. Its many legs twitched as it disappeared inside the tunnel.   
 
When I woke up, it was morning. I was in my bed. My parents were standing over me, wearing matching gray outfits. “Time for school, son,” Father said. “You wouldn’t wanna be late for your first day of grade twelve, would you?”
 
Grade twelve? 
 
Wearily, I went to the washroom, and whizzed. When I looked into the mirror, I froze. Someone else was staring back at me. A man. I blinked, making sure I wasn’t hallucinating. The man in the mirror blinked. I made silly gestures, and the man in the mirror mimicked them. It was me. Had to be. Except, I was old. My hair was mostly gone. And I looked just like my [father.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
