We moved to Rosewood Estate three weeks ago.

You ever seen those neighborhoods that look like someone just copy-pasted the same house thirty times? That’s Rosewood. Cookie-cutter homes, identical mailboxes, perfect lawns. Everyone waves. Everyone smiles.

It was my brother’s idea.
“It’s quiet. Safe. Good schools,” he said.

Which is funny, because neither of us has kids.

He moved in two months before me. Got a place on the next street over. A week later, he called me and said, “You gotta come out here, man. Everyone’s so nice.”

He was right.
Too right.

The first week, everything felt… fine. Boring, even. Martha from across the street brought banana bread. Old guy with Coke-bottle glasses gave me his lawnmower “just to borrow.”
I didn’t go to the welcome party.

Then my brother stopped answering his phone.

At first I thought he was just being a flake — he does that. But after three days, I walked to his place.

Porch light on. Car in the driveway. Curtains shut.
No answer.

I knocked. Banged.
Nothing.

A few neighbors stood in their lawns across the street, completely still. Not staring at me — just… out. Like mannequins.

I left. Filed a missing person report.
The police shrugged. “He’s an adult.”

So I broke into his house.

It wasn’t trashed. No sign of a struggle. TV remote on the couch. Coffee cup on the counter — half full. His phone on the charger.

On the table: a yellow legal pad. Notes. Dozens of names, some circled. A line at the top:

“They all go to the meetings.”

And at the bottom — a number. No name.

I texted it. Called it. No answer.

Until that night:
One reply.
🕷️
And one word: Careful.

Edit: Someone’s been in my house.
Door was unlocked.
Note on my pillow:

“Let him go. He’s at peace now. You will be too, soon.”

I kept texting the number. Eventually, I got a reply.

His name was James.
He told me my brother had been researching something. A cult. Something in the neighborhood.
He said my brother had found proof. Followed them. Filmed something he shouldn’t have.

James sent me a scanned newspaper clipping:

“Local Cult Investigated After Six Disappearances — No Charges Filed.”

Guess who was in the photo?
Martha.
Smiling.

I went back to my brother’s place.
The door was open.

Lights on. Shower running.

I left. Fast.

James texted me that night:

“If he comes back… don’t believe it’s him.”

Edit:
He came back.
He knocked on my door at 10:42 PM.
Smiling. Hair wet. Holding a six-pack.

“Hey man, sorry I’ve been out of touch. Just needed time.”

He smiled. Asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. Said he had a recipe he wanted to try.

My brother’s never cooked a day in his life.

Edit: James is gone. His messages stopped.

Someone left a container on my porch.

White powder. No label.
A note in red marker:

“For the recipe.”

Edit:
They invited me to the Sunday Social.
My brother said, “There’s a special dish being prepared. You’ll love it.”

Edit:
They tied me up.

There were other newcomers — a dozen of us. All in white.
They said it was tradition. My brother told me, “It’s more meaningful if you sit with the first-timers.”

I believed him.

He said, “We need evidence. Play along. Eat just enough to blend in.”

So I sat down.

Then they tied us all up.

He looked at me. Smiled.
Kneeled down next to my chair.

“We needed you to stop fighting.”
“You were the last one.”
“I’m sorry. But it’s so much better after.”

They brought the trays.

One by one, they lifted the lids. The food wasn’t food.

It moved. It pulsed.

They fed it to the woman at the end.

She screamed.

Then stopped.

Then smiled.

The next man fought harder. They held him down.

Spoon in.

Silence.

Smile.

They got to me.

My brother took the spoon himself.

“You made it this far,” he said. “You’re stronger than most.”

He brought the spoon to my mouth.

I bit his hand.

He didn’t flinch.
Just smiled.

“Still fighting. That’s what makes you beautiful.”

I knocked over a lantern. The flames caught fast.

The black thing on my tray screeched.
One of them launched off the table, into someone’s neck.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I made it out.

I just remember the fire.

And my brother standing in the middle of it, untouched.

Smiling.

I’ve been hiding in a shed at the edge of the estate.

There’s a gate. Black iron. Hidden behind hedges.

I think it’s the way out. I haven’t tried it yet.

I don’t trust anything here.

I haven’t eaten. I’m drinking rainwater. It tastes like rust, but at least it doesn’t move.

I’m still trying to find a way out.
To warn people.
To do something.

I’ve lost them for now — I don’t know how long that’ll last. But I’ll keep going as long as I can.

Please, if you’re reading this, spread the word.

Don’t eat anything unless you’re absolutely sure where it came from.
Filter your water.
Don’t trust friendly neighbors if their smiles feel too perfect.
And if something feels off — it is.

I’ll try to keep updating, but my battery’s almost dead.
I’m not charging it here.
I don’t want to risk what’s waiting for me back home.

Please share this. Tell someone. Tell everyone.

Don’t let them spread.
