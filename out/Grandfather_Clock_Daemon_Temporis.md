When I was around eight or nine years old, I spent a lot of time at my grandparents’ house. My mum and dad were going through rough patches before their eventual split, so those visits became more and more frequent.

Their home was the classic American old couple’s house, the kind that probably cost them pennies back then but would sell like a goldmine today. I had my own room upstairs, with a big round window that looked out over the front yard.

I used to love being there, until the last time I ever stepped foot in that house.

At the end of the upstairs hallway stood a tall grandfather clock. It loomed there like a sentry, silent and watchful. Every time I left my room to go downstairs, it was there, staring. I could never shake the feeling that it was waiting for something. The kind of presence that makes your instincts tell you to walk faster or run.

One night, I couldn’t sleep. That wasn’t unusual. Whenever it happened, I’d quietly walk down the hall to my grandparents’ room, just to the right. Their door sat right beside the grandfather clock.

But that night was different.

As I stepped out of my room and approached the hallway, I felt something strange. A cold stillness gripped my body. I froze. I wasn’t tired. I wasn’t scared. But my body wouldn’t move.

That’s when I heard the footsteps.

Slow, heavy thuds echoed up the stairs. They grew louder and closer. Then came the breathing, rasping and wet, like lungs struggling to keep up.

Still frozen, my arm reached out for my grandparents’ door. My hand trembled inches from the handle. Then I felt it. A touch on my side.

“Well, aren’t you cute?” a voice rasped behind me.

“Shouldn’t you be sleeping at this time?” it cooed.

Then came a tap.

A slow, deliberate tapping against the glass face of the grandfather clock behind me.

I dared to glance. A shadow stretched across the wall, tall and twisted and unnatural. I could make out limbs, but they were wrong. Bloated and disjointed. Its form was riddled with bulges, like it was growing in places it shouldn’t.

“Well, why don’t you come back to bed?” the thing whispered. “I miss watching you.”

A tear slipped down my cheek.

“Maybe next time you visit your grandparents and disturb me,” it hissed, “I’ll peel their faces from their skulls. Maybe then you’ll have something real to cry about.”

A finger, if you could call it that, reached out. Inky and warped, it gently wiped the tear from my cheek.

Then the clock began to chime.

Three slow, haunting rings.

Three A.M.

“That’s my time,” the thing chuckled. “I’ll see you back in your room.”

My eyelids grew heavy, like iron shutters slamming down. I couldn’t fight it.

“Nighty night.”

Darkness.

When I opened my eyes, it was morning. Light spilled through the round window. For a moment, I thought it had all been a dream, a horrible, vivid nightmare.

Then I heard my grandmother from the hallway.

“Well, well, well… what happened here?”

I climbed out of bed, my body still trembling. When I reached the hall, I saw her standing in front of the grandfather clock.

Its glass face was shattered, shards scattered across the floor. The clock’s hands were frozen, unmoving.

Three o’clock.
