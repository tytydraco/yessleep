 

It started when i moved alone, I gathered so much “treasures” trough the years… Belt buckles, keychains, etc. You name it I got it.

I felt lonely so i adopted a dog, her name is Tess she came from an abusive household where she was mistreated, and beaten quite a few time. 

A few months ago i met Sarah, she’s the love of my life but she doesn’t really comprehend my obsession with gathering all those things, she’s superstitious and hypersensitive she believes in ghost, witchcraft and spiritism and on top of that she’s a devoted Christian because she’s from reunion island where it is part of their culture.

A few days ago while I was walking my dog i noticed an old cardboard box with some cool stuff in front of a house not far away from my flat. 

Something in that box caught my eye, it was a crucifix, I’m no expert in those type of things since i am an atheist. It’s made of brass and simple wood and was sitting in the middle of some old coins, two chalice and an incensory, so I thought it was and old religious person throwing some old junk. 

I could’ve took everything but I automatically picked up the crucifix and walked back home. 

My flat is on ground floor and I have 3 neighbours upstairs, one of them is easily scared so I thought I’d pull a prank on her so i put the crucifix upside down in the corridor. Yes I know even for an atheist it’s a dumb idea…

After two hours i was smoking outside when I I heard my neighbour shouting “Who is the idiot who done that ?”. I suddenly felt stupid so I decided to wait for her to leave the corridor so i can retrieve my new treasure.

I put it in a drawer and forgot about it for a few days, then Sarah came to spend the night and I showed her the crucifix, she grimaced and while looking straight in my eyes she whispered “did you pick this thing up in the streets ?” I asked her why she was whispering and said that I’m dumb and it could already hear us. 

You may start to wonder what could hear us, we have to dig a little in the reunionese folklore to understand that… In reunion island in the cemetery of Saint Pierre there is a very special gravestone, the one that belongs to Sitarane, an infamous killer that apparently drank the blood of his victims. Nowadays Sitarane grave is known to be a site to practice witchcraft and satanism. If you ask any resident of the island they know about this and they swear they could all recognise his putrid energy, and Sarah being hypersensitive could feel it even more.

She started crying and she explained to me that it’s very rare to encounter a Sitarane worshipper in Europe and that i am so unlucky, that I should have listened to her advice and stopped picking up random shit in the streets.

She said to me that this crucifix was radiating with Sitarane presence, and that she couldn’t stand it, she said that this energy was so putrid that she couldn’t even feel mine now and that she will not be able to feel at ease in my company ever again because i was now cursed by and old killer.

She packed her stuff, poured me a drink to ease the fear, and left only saying good luck and leaving me alone, even as a rational person i started freaking out, I felt an unpleasant feeling, I for sure was being scrutinized by an unholy presence. 

My dog stood by my side trying it’s best to cheer me up but nothing could do. 

I headed myself to my bedroom, emptied my drink in one large gulp and started crying, i violently threw the cross on the wall and and it freaking broke releasing a thick dark smoke and in less than a few seconds i collapsed on the floor.

When I woke up I was tied to my bed frame, blood was dripping from my forearms into the two chalice I saw in the cardboard box, and some strange symbols were engraved on my torso. I knew that even if i made as much sound as I could nobody would hear me, because it was really well isolated.

Then a silhouette wearing a black robe with a large hood came into the room, I couldn’t even see an inch of skin, I wondered if it was this crazy worshipper or Sitarane himself. This crazy fanatic picked up the two chalice, turned his back to me and began to fill the room with smoke from the encensory before drinking the contents of the two chalices.

Then the mysterious figure started to walk in my direction, I saw a large ceremonial dagger in his hand, I thought it was the end for me when my dog came rushing in and bit the stranger in the calf, leading to his fall, the figure dropped the knife at my feet and cut himself on the hand with the empty glass on my bed stand. My dog tried to attack again but this coward fled.

I was so happy to have adopted that dog, if it wasn’t for her I would be dead right now. I managed to grab the knife between my feet after some contorsions i managed to get it in my hand, I freed myself and immediately went to the bathroom to heal myself, after that I went to close my door and the fatigue took over me, I was exhausted because of all of this but couldn’t fall asleep and had to drink a whole Hennessy bottle to put myself to sleep.

I called Sarah explained everything and begged her to meet me in a pub so she can tell me everything I need to know about these carvings and the cult of Sitarane. 

She accepted immediately. 

We met up at a pub called O’malleys, I ordered a pint of Guinness and waited for her to come, she sat at the table, sighed and didn’t even get her coat, beanie of gloves off so i knew she wouldn’t stay for long. She asked me to show her the carvings. She said that she’s never seen these before which is quite rare because she knows a lot of things about her culture. 

After that we had a quick conversation that went something like this 

\- Did anything happen after I left ?

\- Yes in a fit of rage I threw the crucifix on the wall and it broke releasing a black smoke.

\- Interesting…

\- Nah this is just straight up terrifying.

\- When you took the crucifix was there something else with it ?

\- Yes, two chalices, an incensor and a dozen of old coins.

\- Tokens.

\- Tokens ? 

\- Yes, everytime a worshipper drinks a person blood he add a token, some use buttons, some use old coins.

\- Shit that means that this wasn’t this person first time hurting someone else…

\- These worshippers leave the island because no one there falls for these nowadays.

Then she got up and left without even saying goodbye. 

When I got back home i decided to pick up the broken shards of glass and noticed something frightening… there was residues in the glass, my drink has been spiked… it was her all along, i should have know when she didn’t took her gloves off… she always takes her gloves off she can’t stand the feeling of having her hands covered but she also can’t stand the cold which is why she wears them… 

I took my dog and prepared myself to confront her and try to accumulate as much evidence as I could to sue her and prevent her from doing any other harm, as i was about to reach for my keys i saw it… a rusty coin lying on my desk then I heard her giggling behind me… Fear kept me from turning around so I did the only thing I could, I ran, left my flat and tried to put as much distance as I could between her and me. 

I’m currently on the last floor of an abandoned building a few kilometers away. I had to leave my dog at the doggy daycare so I know she’s safe. I’m writing this to warn everyone that if you ever see something that catch your attention, please don’t ever pick it up, it could cause you way more trouble than you think…

It’s too late for me now because i forgot I have my localisation on… as I’m writing this I can hear her laugh while climbing the stairs, I am trapped and i will do the only thing I can do, jump off to my death before she catches me…
