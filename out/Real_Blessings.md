The news of Bishop Creighton’s retirement were not surprising to me. Rumors of his retirement had circulated for quite a few years now, and as the Bishop grew older, those rumors only grew louder and louder. I suppose it was to be expected. Bishop Creighton had dutifully served the diocese for thirty seven years and despite only being 76, it was no secret that his health was not what it once was. 

I personally never engaged with the rumor mill, but I’m not completely deaf to the whispers of my peers and with talk of the Bishop’s retirement came talk of his successor. There were a few names floated around but when I heard my name amongst them, I really can’t say I was caught off guard. If anything, I must confess that I’d expected it.

I don’t say that to brag or to imply that I was in any way more deserving than the others who were rumored to be in the running… the Bishop and I had been friends for a number of years by that point. He had been a mentor to me, guiding me in dealing with the daily struggles of leading my congregation. He was a good man. A kind man and I looked up to him in many ways. Though he had not directly spoken to me about his retirement plans, it wasn’t a shock to find out that people suspected I would be one of his choices for a potential successor. 

Now, ultimately the decision on who would succeed Bishop Creighton was not entirely up to him. The final decision would be made by the Vatican, but they also would not just be pulling some random member of the Church and handing the diocese over to them. It would be someone who the Bishop and his colleagues had selected and vetted. Once that shortlist was offered to the Vatican, then the choice would be made between the candidates… and even then, the Bishop’s favor and personal recommendation would likely be a deciding factor. 

It feels conceited to say this, but when Bishop Creighton told me that he wanted to put my name forward as a potential successor, a part of me already knew that I would have his recommendation.

Good grief… I suspect I’ve already painted myself as a prideful and arrogant man, haven’t I? I do not wish to come across as such. I certainly do not see myself as such… yet I suppose it’s impossible to deny that I’d anticipated the Bishop’s decision, and had he chose to gone in another direction, I will not pretend that I wouldn’t have been upset.

Pride is a deadly sin - this I know. But even without factoring in my own positive self opinion, I also know how to read a room. 

According to the church, a Bishop must be temperate, compassionate, hospitable, gentle and wise. They must be a teacher unbound by vice, beloved and trusted by the community and… have a doctorate in theology. 

Temperance, compassion, hospitality, wisdom and kindness were all subjective. While I certainly thought of myself in those terms, ultimately it was for others to judge me so. Though I believed myself a good teacher with a good reputation, that was again something others would need to see in me. But the doctorate? That wasn’t quite as subjective.

In my youth, Bishop Creighton had encouraged me to pursue such a higher education and I had devoted many long years to following his advice. I suppose pursuing an education was the wisest thing I could do. My body hadn’t been much good since a bad car accident several years ago. Some misguided kid in a truck had thought they could catch a light. Unfortunately they ended up T-boning my vehicle. The accident had left me hospitalized and even after months of therapy, it was still difficult to get around without a cane… but I managed. Going back to school had given me something to focus on through my recovery. It had given me something to strive toward, a reason to keep going. The Bishop had been a guiding hand and diligent supporter all through my education… and when I had finally graduated, he was among the first to congratulate me. Looking back, it was hard to interpret our relationship as anything but a man mentoring his successor… and given the fact that so many others seemed to think so too, I don’t think it was too presumptuous for me to believe that I *would* be Bishop Creighton’s successor. 

With all of that said - when the Bishop requested I join him for dinner a few weeks ago, I don’t believe I was wrong to assume that he would be informing me that the Vatican had made its choice, and I would become his successor.

To say I wasn’t giddy would be a lie. To even be considered for the position was a great honor, but to actually get it? To succeed Bishop Creighton? It was everything I had ever wanted! Everything I had been working toward for years… decades even! Despite my devotion to The Lord, ultimately I am just a man… bound by earthly desires and wants. Status could be a dangerous thing, but all humans crave validation for their work and I will not pretend I am above that. I’m not going to claim humility for saying such either - all people have an ego. I just try to be mindful of my own.

When I found out that Bishop Creighton wished to meet at the cathedral though, I won’t pretend I wasn’t a little confused. I had expected to meet at his home. Perhaps this meeting was meant to be a little more formal? If so, that did stoke my hopes, although it nevertheless seemed a bit out of character for him. 

For the sake of privacy - I will not name the cathedral of my diocese. For reasons that will become clear later, I don’t believe it’s best if I tell you too much and I will confess now that I have omitted or altered a few details in this retelling to ensure relative anonymity. I will say that our cathedral is a sight to behold. It’s a historic building, lovingly crafted in the traditional gothic style so common to many other cathedrals. It is a work of art inside and out, and setting foot inside - especially at dusk - is nothing short of breathtaking. The twilight shines so beautifully through the stained glass windows, making them glimmer in the most captivating way.

At the altar is an extraordinary sculpture depicting the crucifixion. In it, Christ is frozen in an almost lifelike tableau, a look of serenity on his face as he makes his sacrifice. Each little detail of his body is rendered with care. Beneath him, a fisherman’s net is cast - a metaphor for the mission he calls us all to undertake in his name… and also a base for the sculpture. 

I allowed myself to marvel at the way the light from the windows illuminated it as I walked into the cathedral that evening, before the voice of Bishop Creighton drew my attention.

   “Father Fitzpatrick! So good to see you!”

I looked over to see the Bishop approaching me. He was slow and looked tired, but his smile was as warm as ever.

   “Bishop!” I said warmly.

   “Just Paul, please,” He insisted. “I think you and I are past the formalities at this point, don’t you?”

I smiled sheepishly at him, before he gestured for me to follow. 

   “How have you been, Martin? How’s your leg?”

   “As good as it can get - I make do.” I said. “Some days hurt more than others.”

   “I suppose that’s to be expected,” The Bishop said. “The road to recovery is a long one… but you seem to be bouncing back very fast, all things considered.”

He led me back to an office near the back of the cathedral. An office I’d been in many times before - although I’d never seen food in there. There were a couple of warm takeout containers waiting on his desk. Thai, by the looks of it.

   “I remembered your usual order,” the Bishop said. “At least I think I did. Hopefully you don’t mind if we eat quickly. I am on a bit of a schedule this evening.”

   “No, no. Not at all!” I insisted as I sat down across from him. He had indeed gotten my usual order right. Massaman curry and crispy spring rolls. I like the sweetness of the curry, and the spring rolls from our usual place are wonderful. 

   “Good, good.” He eased himself into his chair. He took his time to pour us both some wine. He offered me a glass, and clinked it against mine.

   “To your health,” He said. 

   “Thank you, Bishop.” I took a long sip. The wine had a strange aftertaste that I didn’t recognize. I was about to ask about it, but he spoke again before I could get the question out.

   “Well… I presume you already have a good idea on what this is about, don’t you Martin?”

   “I suspect I have a good idea,” I said. “Have you heard from the Vatican or…?”

   “No. No, not yet… and we won’t for some time. The investigative process is still underway. It is drawing to a close, although I’ve yet to give the Archbishop and the nunico my recommendation for the position.”

He hadn’t given his recommendation yet?

I didn’t say anything, but I suspect the moment of silence between us said plenty. Bishop Creighton chuckled softly.

   “I know… you’re expecting it to be you, aren’t you?” He said. “It’s alright. No harm in admitting it. I’ve been hoping you would be my replacement for a number of years now.”

   “Then why haven’t you given your recommendation?” I asked.

   “Well, I wanted to speak to you in person first.”

His tone darkened a little. He pushed his food around the plastic tray it was in, but didn’t take a bite. He seemed to take a few moments to gather his thoughts before he spoke.

   “You know Martin… every man has his secrets. Even me. Most are harmless. Little sins. Little vices. We’re all human. We all have them. Denying that would be an arrogant mistake. But mine are…”

He trailed off, unsure how to continue.

   “You know… I’ve struggled…” He finally said. “It’s hard to keep your faith when you look out at the world we live in. Not just today… although today does seem so much worse, doesn’t it? It makes you wonder how history will remember it all, although if you even spend a moment looking at history you’ll see atrocity upon atrocity upon atrocity. So many that it’s hard to see it all and still believe in the truth of God’s love.”

   “What exactly are you saying?” I asked warily. “You don’t believe in God's love anymore?”

   “No…” He answered, looking up at me. “No… to be perfectly honest with you, I don’t think I do. I don’t think I have in a while and I’m not sure if God ever truly loved us. I do still believe in God… if anything, I believe in God more strongly than I ever have before. But in His unconditional love? No. That I can not believe in.” 

   “I don’t understand,” I said. “How can you believe in God, but not in His love?”

   “It’s hard to explain in words,” The Bishop said. “But that is why I wanted you here tonight. It’s easier if I show you.”

I stared at him, a silent suspicion creeping into my gaze, although exactly what I feared - I could not quite articulate. 

   “Show me…?” I repeated. “I’m not sure I follow.”

   “It’s far less complicated than I’m making it sound, I assure you,” He said. “There was a reason I called you to dinner here. I wanted you at the cathedral this evening. You see, we’re holding a mass tonight, and some associates of mine will be arriving within the hour.”

   “Mass? Tonight?” I asked. There had been nothing scheduled for this evening.

   “It’s a private event,” The Bishop clarified. “As I said, it’s much easier to show you than to explain any of it. I can’t say my description will come off as anything more than the ramblings of an old man…” He chuckled mirthlessly. “Ah, but I see I’m already falling into that trap, aren’t I?”

He pointed at me, his expression a little playful.

   “I can see it in your eyes… you’re sitting there and wondering *‘has the old man snapped?*’ Don’t you deny it, I can tell!”

He wasn’t wrong. I was wondering if he’d gone senile. The Bishop had always been as sharp as a knife, but seeing him like this left me with questions.

All the same - he still had my trust and despite his cryptic words, I wanted to believe that there was a point at the end of all this. 

   “This is all a little eccentric,” I admitted. “But, I trust it will make sense soon?”

   “Soon,” He promised, and for the time being that promise was enough for me.

\*\*\*

As the Bishop had promised, there was a group of strangers who arrived about forty minutes later. None of them were people I’d recognized. Most of them were men, and they seemed to be led by a particular stone faced individual with dark hair in a sleek white jacket. The Bishop had introduced him as Mr. Satchell.

   “He’s been a close friend for a number of years,” The Bishop explained. “Like you, I took him under my wing once upon the time, although the Priesthood ended up not quite being his calling.”

Satchell just gave a half nod, but never said what exactly his real calling had been. Judging by the look of the men who’d come with him, my guess was that it was military… but why would the Bishop be hosting a private mass for a bunch of ex-military types? Perhaps this was some sort of veterans meeting, but why the secrecy then? I never got the opportunity to ask many questions of Mr. Satchell, as once he’d had his brief meet and greet with the man, the Bishop quickly led me toward the altar.

   “Best not to dally too much,” He said. “There is no time limit on these things - but I’d hate to take more of these gentlemens time than would be needed.”

   “And what exactly are these gentlemen here for?” I asked, confused. I noticed Satchell gesturing for some of the men to head up to the second floor, and saw them carrying large ominous looking cases that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a game hunters truck.

   “You’ll see,” The Bishop replied. Another ominous statement. It was a little annoying. 

He approached the altar, and set a book out upon it, although it did not appear to be a bible. This book was bound in red leather, and had no title on the cover. The pages were worn and dog eared. Looking over his shoulder, I could see obscene occult diagrams inside.

This was no bible.

   “Paul, what exactly is that?” I demanded. He looked over at me, his expression calm.

   “A grimoire” He admitted. “One of the more reputable ones. It was left to me by my predecessor… it’s a fascinating tool to explore the occult with although if I must be honest, so few things that claim to be occult truly are. In my experience, if no mention of it can be found within this book, then it isn’t of the supernatural.”

   “But why is it on the altar?” I asked.

   “It is easiest to do this here… you’ll see why soon.”

He found the page he wanted and took his time to light the candles on the altar. As he did, I looked down at the page before us. The text had been mundanely translated to plain english and read as follows.

***On the summoning of Angels***

*In circumstances where one must directly commune with the highest of the divine, it is ill advised to attempt to invoke any of the Ancient Gods. Though rituals exist and have been provided to attempt contact, there is never a guarantee that they will be successful. The Ancient Gods will not be called like mongrel dogs and are not inclined to grant gifts to those who ask. Each of the four are temperamental, fickle and prone to anger - some more than others.* 

*In circumstances where one desires to directly commune with the highest of the divine - it is far more advisable to invoke an Angel, although one must remain mindful that not all Angels should be summoned. Sailian Angels should only be summoned in extraordinary circumstances and Anitharine Angels should not be summoned under any circumstances. The rituals for them included here are included solely for the sake of documentation and must not be attempted.*

*It is more preferable to invoke a Malvian or Shaalitic Angel, as these souls are oft eager to serve, often benevolent and can be bound - although be aware that dire consequences may befall those who bind them carelessly.* 

Angels… binding… what was this madness? I looked to the Bishop, hoping for answers but he provided none.

   “Paul?” I asked. “Paul, what the hell is this?”

   “Best to take a seat, old friend…” He said. “You don’t want to be too close when we begin…”

He looked up toward the cathedrals balcony, and I spotted Satchell up there. Satchell gave him a curt nod, and the Bishop turned back to the book. He set it aside, before taking a dagger from his robes. I could only watch, unsure what to say or do as I drew the knife across his hand. Then in his own blood, I watched him draw some sort of rune.

   *“Lost souls close to me, I beg you heed my call for aid. Come forth on wings divine, to have thine debt repaid.”*

He encircled the rune in some kind of oil, before taking one of the candles he’d lit and setting the oil ablaze.

The Bishop closed his eyes, and I heard him begin to chant, although I could not hear the prayer he uttered. I could only watch this quiet madness, unable to make heads or tails of any of it. It seemed like some sort of blasphemy… but I could not imagine the Bishop of all people committing such an obscene act atop the Lord’s own altar! There had to be some sane explanation for this! There just had to be!

Then - I heard it.

Footsteps drawing nearer behind us.

I looked back to see that someone new had joined us in the cathedral, someone I did not recognize. She seemed young, with long dark hair and a gentle smile… but there was no way she could have been an angel! 

   “You called for me?” She asked. 

The Bishop looked back at her, almost completely unsurprised by her sudden appearance.

   “Yes…” He said softly, his voice low and grave. “Yes… I did…”

The young woman drew closer.

   “Well, here I am!” She said, her voice chipper and upbeat. “And what can I do for you, Bishop?”

I saw a look of melancholy appear in the Bishop’s eyes. He never answered her question… instead, the only answer she got was a chorus of sudden snaps from the balcony, before several crossbow bolts tore into her body.

That was when I saw them… the men Satchell had come in with, all looming over the railing, crossbows in hand, each one tethering the girl with a rope. As the bolts tore into her body, an agonized scream escaped her. She should have died on the spot, but instead she writhed and twisted, fighting like her life depended on it.

   “I’m so sorry, child…” The Bishop said softly as the young woman tried to stumble away from us.

   *“N-no…”* I heard her rasp. She tried desperately to rip the bolts out of her… and I could watch her suffer no longer. I moved forward to try and help her, but the Bishop’s firm hand on my shoulder stopped me.

   “Watch…” He said, his voice disturbingly calm despite the madness unfolding before us. 

   “She’s dying!” Was all I could say in response.

   “Nonsense… she’s already dead.”

The girl collapsed, panting heavily. Then, with a groan of exertion, I watched as a set of luminous wings blossomed from her back. They spread wide and the sight of them left me breathless.

What was this? A hallucination? Madness? What?

Her wings tried to flap and lifted her off the ground. For a moment, I thought she might actually tear herself free of the crossbow bolts embedded in her flesh… but the sound of even more crossbows firing sealed her fate. The scream she made as they tore into her majestic wings…

I will never unhear it. She plummeted back to the ground with a thud, sobbing in agony as she lay there, pierced by countless crossbow bolts… although I didn’t see a single drop of blood coming out of her. I watched Mr. Satchell descend down the stairs from the balcony. He approached the poor, wounded girl… that angel… with a look of calm disinterest. I saw the machete in his hand and felt my heart claw its way up into my throat… but I did nothing.

I just watched.

Without a word, he grabbed one of the angels wings, and began to hack at it, severing it bloodlessly from her body. She still screamed as it was cleaved off of her body, sobbing in despair and agony as she was mutilated. Once the wing was cut free, I watched it fizzle out into nothingness before he started on the second wing. I could only stare in horrified silence… and beside me, the Bishop just looked stoic.

Once the angels wings were gone, Satchell cut through the ropes keeping her in place. Two of his men had come down to grab the twitching, helpless angel and I watched as they dragged her away.

   “Come,” The Bishop said and I quietly followed him, unsure just what new horror we were about to witness. 

A hallway off to the side led to a stairway that took us down to the cellar. I watched in silence as the Angel was dragged down those stairs, still convulsing from the pain and unable to speak. Satchell went ahead of his men and quietly opened a door, before gesturing for them to go inside. He looked at the Bishop, who gestured for him to go on ahead.

   “I will warn you - what you’ll see in this room will be upsetting,” He said.

   “As if this madness wasn’t already upsetting?” I asked. “What the hell is this, Paul? What the hell are you doing?!”

   “As I said, Martin… I no longer believe in God’s unconditional love. But I do believe in God. How can I not, when I’ve borne witness to His Angels? Angels whom He has favored… you see, they are the ones He has blessed, Martin. They are the souls He has given a second chance to. They are servants of God and thus carry his inherent blessing… a symbol of His love. And if God will not love us freely… then it seems only right that I take that love, doesn’t it? If not for myself… then to give it to those who are more deserving!”

   “W-what?” Was all I could stammer. “Paul this… that doesn’t make any sense!”

   “Doesn’t it?” He asked. “Angel blood is said to have incredible properties… I wasn’t sure about it at first, but after some experimentation, I’ve concluded that the claims of the grimoire are true. In many ways, it serves as a physical blessing that I can share with the diocese. I’m still working on just how much to have in the communion wine. Currently, I suspect it’s a little too diluted and I haven’t seen many promising results. But I hope you might be able to figure it out for me, once you take over.”

My heart skipped a beat.

Take over?

That was the moment it all clicked into place. He wanted me to continue this madness… and if I would not do it, he would find someone who would.

My eyes drifted toward the open door as a quiet fear took hold of my heart.

   “You should see it firsthand,” The Bishop said. “As I said… it is upsetting…

I stepped through the doorway, and was greeted by a sight that defied my worst expectations.

Several beds were set up, and all of them were occupied… some by men, some by women… all of them pale and emaciated. All of them hooked up to machines that pumped the blood from them. 

   “They can’t die, of course…” The Bishop said. “But every now and then, their bodies give out and they… fade. In which case they need to be replaced.”

I looked back at him, trying to find the words but failing.

Madness… that was the only description I had for this. 

Madness.

   “In time… I believe that we can change this world for the better,” The Bishop said. “We can give our congregations a real blessing… real salvation… we can make a difference, Martin!”

   “With this…?” I asked, my voice tinged with disgust.

   “You don’t think so?” He asked.

   *“This is depraved, Paul! It’s… it’s sick! You find out Angels exist, and you farm them for their fucking blood?”*

   “In the end, the benefits will outweigh the cost,” He said, his tone almost dismissive.

   “You can’t know that!” I snapped.

   “I can… and soon you will too.”

I paused.

   “Take the night to think it over, Martin. I don’t expect an answer from you tonight. I know this is a lot to take in, but I also knew that I could never hope to explain this to you any other way. We’ll talk tomorrow… and you can tell me how you feel then.”

I caught a knowing smirk on his lips… and then I remembered the wine he’d given me with dinner.

   “No…” I said, “No, Paul… you didn’t…”

   “It’s a more concentrated dose,” He said. “I wanted you to feel the blessing for yourself. Perhaps then, you might understand.”

For a moment, I considered lunging at him. Wrapping my hands around his throat and strangling the life from him right then and there! But the sight of Satchell and his men lingering nearby, watching us intently stayed my hand. I took a step back, and I stumbled back up the steps, out of that church and away from Bishop Paul Creighton.

\*\*\*

I felt the change the next morning. My leg no longer hurt. I didn’t even need my cane to get around… and yet that lack of pain did nothing about the weight in my heart.

I knew what I’d seen last night.

I knew what the Bishop was doing.

I knew it was real.

He called me a few times - but I refused to answer. Each time the phone rang, I looked at it. My hand unconsciously went to my leg, and I remembered the pain I’d felt not even a day before. But I could not bring myself to pick up the phone. I could not bring myself to talk to him again… because even I was not entirely sure what I’d say.

Unfortunately, I could not avoid him forever.

When the Bishop came to my apartment… I couldn’t ignore him any longer. He mostly talked… I had very little to say… and admittedly, I do not remember the finer details of our conversation. I only know that he promised me everything, and every single fibre of my being longed to take it… I am just a mortal man… I am fallible… and even though the screams of the angel echoed through my mind, the memory of the pain in my leg was also starting to fade.

Try as I might, I could not deny that his mad little plot had merit… 

But in the end I could not do it.

I remember the way his expression had darkened when I’d said that. He was disappointed… perhaps even angry, although he never said as much.

   “I see…” Was all he said. Then after a moments pause - “Very well, then… I suppose you’ve made your decision and all I can do is respect it. In that case, I won’t take up any more of your time, Father Fitzpatrick.” There was something in his tone that broke my heart… the way he spoke to me like a stranger in that moment… I knew our friendship was over.

I wanted nothing more than to apologize and tell him I would be happy to succeed him… maybe I could stop this madness from within! But something told me that I wouldn’t.

Satchell likely wouldn’t permit this operation to end… and I doubted he and the Bishop were the only major players. There was more to it that he had not shown me, that I was certain of. Who’s to say I could stop it from the inside? 

Who’s to say I even would…?

Within the week, Bishop Creighton’s replacement was announced. Father Kuepfer… a name I recognized, but didn’t know well.

I took the news better than I would have expected, but then again, now I knew what the job would have entailed. When less than a week later, both he and Bishop Creighton perished during a fire at the cathedral, I didn’t do more than offer my shallow condolences.  I am told that they only found a few bodies in the rubble of the cathedral after the fire… and I have heard nothing about any secret room found underneath it. I suspect that even if the police or the firefighters did find it, they wouldn’t find any bodies.

After all, the occupants were already dead.
