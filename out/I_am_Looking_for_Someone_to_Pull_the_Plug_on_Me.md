I am desperately looking for someone to pull the plug on me.  Not sometime in the distant future, but ideally as soon as possible, without taking time to get things in proper legal order or anything else.  I know that many people may find this offensive or distasteful, but please hear me out.  If you understand the pain I am in and how I have suffered, I think most anyone would be sympathetic. 

I am a professional estate executor, or I guess more precisely I should say *was*.  Basically, I get paid to settle the estates of people that have passed away and either have families too wealthy to deal with their own crap, or simply don’t have any loved ones around to do it.  In reality, 90% of the time I’m hired by estate attorneys.

Recently I was hired to settle the estate of a decedent with assets dispersed globally, having significant holdings both in the U.S. and across Europe.  One of the assets I needed to attend to was an old parcel of land in the foothills of the Moldavian Subcarpathians.  Travelling out of the country for work is not unprecedented for me, and it typically pays extremely well, but generally I loathe doing it.  It won’t surprise you to learn that I don’t speak a lick of Moldovan, and as a former Soviet region, English is not all that widely spoken, and this was a job I wouldn’t have dreamed of taking on had I realized what it involved before I’d signed up.

So, reluctantly, I headed off to the middle of nowhere in NW Moldova, feeling more than a little bit like the solicitor at the start of Dracula, and wondering whether I should’ve gotten my own affairs in order before departing.  And don’t worry, this has nothing to do with vampires (or creepy dolls coming to life – more on that later). 

I arrived at the large parcel of land to find an ancient decrepit house that looked more castle than farmstead.  I went into the house to happily find that this may not require as much work or time as I’d anticipated, with the home half empty, being mostly some old furniture to assess and dispose of. 

Strolling through the house, however, my heart dropped when I opened the door of a room to find a vast collection of marionette dolls, displayed wall-to-wall.  Collectibles are the bane of my existence.  With some commonly collected items, like coins, it’s easy enough to find reasonable values or a numismatist to assess everything and usually even liquidate the collection for me (we don’t have a lot of incentive to get the best price.  This did not look to be the case here.

The spacious room had rows and rows of antique marionettes from wainscoting to ceiling.  The only break in the dolls was a several foot wide floor to ceiling mirror, and the doorway to the room itself.  The room was much longer than it was wide, eerily long for where it was nested into the manor’s floorplan, almost as if it shouldn’t have fit.  The floorboards ran parallel to the room’s length, and the mirror was directly across from the door so that looking into it gave the impression that you were surrounded by an endless sea of marionettes, bearing down on you from above. 

These were the type of old-timey, hand crafted and painted dolls that you picture going back to the Renaissance.  Like string puppets in a travelling show, or Punch and Judy dolls.  Assessing, cataloguing and liquidating these in a country where I wasn’t even sure if I *could* google things was going to take forever.  The immense time spent on these types of things also tends to get questioned on expense reports, which sets me up for uncomfortable conversations with the families of clients and occasionally the IRS.

It was also at that moment that I remembered I was forced to stay in this house, with no inns or other alternatives nearby.  At least there was no bed in the marionette room, so that one was off the table.

The first few days and nights there passed largely unremarkably.  On several occasions, however, I had woken at night to hear a distant ratcheting sound that seemed to come from deep inside the house.  The noise would slowly click, and was accompanied by a ping like the sound of heavy cables being drawn taught, and it would build erratically over the course of several minutes to a crescendo pop.  It was almost like a giant jack in the box being cranked to eruption, without the campy music. 

Over the first several days, I progressed along with my inventory of the property, going room by room, planning to defer the marionette collection until I had completed everything else.  It would take the longest, so I should’ve gotten on it first, but hey, why not enjoy my time there, right?

One night, however, I was awakened by the ratcheting sound rattling from deep within the house.  I lay awake for some time, listening as the click-click would slowly build to a snap, then start all over again.  After some time tossing and turning like this, the noise began to feel like it was burrowing deeper into my head with each click, before bursting deep inside my brain, before beginning anew.  With the realization that sleep would not come, I decided it was time to investigate.

The noise seemed to be almost ambient, coming from all directions, but after roaming the house to try and zero in on a source, I was utterly unsurprised to find that as best I could tell, it was coming from the marionette room.  I wasn’t exactly the type to be afraid of some creepy dolls, but you know…alone in middle of nowhere Eastern Europe and all that.  I also forgot to mention that we were not operating with a fully powered and lit house here…oh no, it was nighttime navigation by cell flashlight, and conserving charge on the handful of power banks I’d brought along.

I paused outside of the room to reassess things (or maybe muster some courage) and the ratcheting noise began to sound almost inviting.  Throwing caution to the wind, I stepped into the room to investigate.  The rational part of my mind kept telling me there must be a marionette in there with some kind of wind-up aspect, or ratcheting gears like an old clock, but as I entered the room I had the cold realization that that was not the case. 

Nothing inside looked any different or disturbed, other than a whole mess of tantalizing and intimidating shadows cast by the dim, dusty light.  I held still so I could focus on the sound, and quickly realized that it didn’t seem to actually be coming from inside the room at all, and instead still seemed to come from all directions through the house. Too tired and cold at this point, I just shrugged and called it a night.

A night or two after that, I was again awoken by the ratcheting sound, and after trying in vain to ignore it, decided it was really, really time to get to the bottom of it, if nothing else than for my own curiosity and sanity.  After some strolling and triangulation, I again found myself in that damn room.  This time, however, I slowly made my way around the room, trying to determine if the sound was louder in any spot.  As I made my way down the long room, the noise grew and seemed to pulse, like I was approaching the heart of the house.

As I came around towards the mirror, I caught something out of the corner of my eye and froze.  In my peripheral I could see a dark mass laying on the floor, and half gave a sigh of relief, thinking a marionette had merely fallen off the shelf.  That sigh was quickly choked off, however, as I turned to see the figure of a man lying there in a heap as if he’d fallen out of the mirror. 

I froze in terror as the man moaned, and started to stumble to his feet like he was drunk.  I backed away towards the door, watching while the man awkwardly gained his footing and began to shuffle and totter towards me, reaching out his arm with a raspy moan.  What I first took as a predatory pursuit, in hindsight seemed more like a desperate plea.

The man lurched forward, and I heard the sound of his ankle snap, buckling him lower towards the ground, but he kept upright.  With each blundering step forward, he seemed to further deteriorate, with the cracking of bones fading to the grinding of gravel.  In the distance of several feet, the man eroded away nearly to mush, with his moaning becoming labored and a gurgle as his structure collapsed. 

The pile in front of me looked like a human octopus; a sack of amorphous skin and innards with a head plopped on top.  There weren’t any homes nearby to run for help, and even if I had cell service, I had no idea what the equivalent of 9-1-1 was, so I reluctantly decided to try and help the man and bent down towards him.  With a squishy grunt, a tentacle arm swung up at me, and I felt the cold, gooey appendage slide across my cheek.  I think I even felt the scratch of a nail.  I came to my senses and ran. 

I spent that night huddled in the shed, wondering if I did the right thing, and worried that I’d left a man suffering and helpless.

With the benefit of daylight the following morning, my resolve steeled, and guilt began to creep in, so I went back to check on the man – or whatever it was – but found nothing there. 

I reminded myself that I had a job to do, and managed to push the incident back to the “I’ll deal with that shit later” place in my mind.  It is amazing what you can ignore if you set your mind to it – I think it’s a sign of a strong will to have the ability to utterly ignore reality. 

At the risk of running long, I’ll try and cut to the chase here.

A few more nights passed of the now familiar ratcheting and moans, but thankfully without any incidents as visceral as that man’s, or whatever it was, skin on my skin. It was just about long enough to convince myself that the noises, lack of sleep, and combination of environmental factors had been enough to make me either dream what had happened, or hyperbolize it in my own mind.

And at last it was time to get cracking on assessing the damn dolls.

I went back into that room for the first time in days, half expecting to find it in disarray, with demonically possessed dolls having ran pell-mell all over the place, but was relieved to find everything pleasantly in order. After an exaggerated sigh of relief, I noticed, however, that the mirror at the back of the room was slightly askew, and walked over to find that it actually was concealing a door, which was now slightly ajar.

 

And that was the last happy moment I’ve ever had.

The next thing I knew, I awoke to the two worst discoveries of my life. First, I found myself inside a dungy, poorly-lit, room that had more the feel of an oubliette than a dungeon, but instead of a trapdoor up top, there was one lone door that I had absolutely no doubt in my mind was the backside of that mirror.

Second, when I immediately tried to move to leave, I realized that I was confined inside something resembling a tightly fitting suit of armor, but with far too many joints, hinges and orifices. The suit covered me from head-to-toe, but I didn’t seem to have much restriction of movement other than if I moved any part of myself too far I found resistance in the form of a series of cables connecting from many different points on the suit to various holes in the wall and ceiling around me. In my panic, I didn’t think much of what the contraption might be for, other than I knew it was nothing good.

I sat there just like that for what seemed like an eternity, with all manner of things going through my head just as you’d expect. My best guess is that it was around a day or so, but I truly have very little idea – it could’ve been anywhere from a few hours to a few days.

Do me a favor here; drop everything you’re doing for a moment, give it a solid 30 seconds in good faith, and think deeply on the types of wild things that would be going through your head in that situation. That man had to have been a sadistic psychopath, right? Or a parade of haunted dolls were about to stroll through that door intent on making my time on Earth end in unspeakable ways? And maybe, just maybe, you’re being pranked on a tv show. That tiny, unlikely and unrealistic glimmer of hope was the absolute worst.

All I really remember of it, other than the sheer terror, was the disturbing silence that starkly contrasted with the repetitive noises I’d nearly grown accustomed to. And that as time passed, the hope that this was merely a prank evaporated.

I had just began to think critically on what horrors might be in store, and what purpose this antiquated contraption might serve, when I heard the first click. The ratcheting noise began again slowly, but this time sounding much closer.

Each click reverberated around my restricted enclosure with a staccato thrum that slowly died out like it was beckoning the next click. Click. My heart began pounding in anticipation between clicks as the mechanical pulse slowly built up speed. Click. I began to get incredibly hot inside the metal suit. Click. My eyes burned and vision blurred as sweat trickled down. Click.

Suddenly I felt a light tug on my left arm, and it all became ever so clear. One of the cables was retracting into the wall with each ratchet of the device, pulling my arm back with it at an unnatural angle. I think I screamed, but all I recall is mechanical toll echoing repeatedly around the room. With one more click, my arm was pulled just to the brink of snapping, and pain reverberated up my arm from the pressure. And then the clicking stopped.

I sat there, just long enough to wonder what was happening, just long enough to provide a glimmer of hope of reprieve, and just long enough to fully comprehend what was coming next. Click.

My arm snapped. For a moment the pop of the bone filled the empty silence between clicks. Then, with a sudden flurry of ratchets my arm was bent nearly back onto itself.

It was at that moment I vividly recalled the grotesque site of the man from the other night whom I’d blocked from my memory, and his gooey, malleable, cephalopod-like body.

The process repeated countless times, with every part of my body being contorted into unimaginable shapes and poses. Eventually I was so broken that there seemed to be nothing left, and I couldn’t have moved an inch if I’d been able to.

The device began to move rapidly, with the ratchets becoming a steady, throbbing hum, as I was swung from one malformed pose to the next, like a marionette on macabre display. The cables began to whirr, manipulating my jellified body through various dances and pantomimes in cruel jest.

And that is all I remember.

So here I sit, in a yellow hospital room in the middle of nowhere in Moldova, crumbled beyond recognition, relating my story to an orderly in a desperate plea for someone to come save me and pull the plug. 

Please.
