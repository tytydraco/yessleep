We used to explore graveyards.
Other days, it was abandoned buildings.

Why?
Because my friends wanted to.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t even like horror.
But sometimes, the aesthetics pull you in.

Gothic, Gore, Weirdcore, Paranormal, Psychological dread, 
They’re disturbing,

but in a intriguing way.

We’d wander, then leave.
Oddly enough, the guards never stopped us.
They’d just... ignore the fact that a bunch of teenagers were loitering in off-limit zones.

Until one day...

There were no guards.

Just an overgrown path leading to an old, rotting garden wall.
Spray-painted across it, in black ink:
“The Abandoned Ones.”

No context.

Just three rusted warning signs below it, each painted with a red cross:



1. A stick figure running from a tree.
The tree’s branches were heavy with round, smiling fruits.


2. The same figure, now looking up at them.
The fruits were smiling wider.


3. A taller man- too tall -standing before smaller figures walking toward him.



The signs didn’t make sense.
They weren’t official. Just... painted.

Jonathan and I stayed outside.
The other three went in.

We waited for them.
Got bored. Then we left after texting in the group chat.

That night, I got a text from Jordan:

"You abandoned us. Fuck you."

I just stared at the screen. My chest felt heavy.
Jordan never talks like that. He was quiet. Goofy sometimes, but never angry.

I fell asleep with that message in my chest like a bitter knot I couldn’t untangle.

The next day at school, Jonathan leaned over my desk,

“They didn’t come home last night. They stayed in the garden.”

I blinked. “How... do you know?”

He sighed. “Daniel’s parents called me last night. Daniel did not return home... Daniel said we abandoned them. They will not return.”

I stiffened. “You too?”

He frowned. “Wait... you got a call?”

“Not a call,” I said, “A message from Jordan.”

Jonathan crossed his arms. “They’ve never been angry about splitting up before.”

“So... you think something’s wrong?” I asked feeling uneasy. 

He nodded. “Let’s go after class. Since they say we are responsible, we should do something.”

I hesitated,
Those signs were stuck in my head,

“But those signs-”

“Alex,” he cut in, “we’ve broken more rules than we can count. What’s one more?”

I didn’t answer. Just sighed, and nodded.


---

After school, we returned to the garden.
We’d texted them. They replied immediately.

Still in the garden. Won’t leave.

The sun was starting to set. The sky streaked orange and violet.

We entered after I also forced Jonathan to memorize the three signs.

The garden was quiet.
Rows of trees, flower bushes, vines curled around broken benches.
No animals or birds.

Maybe it was too close to nightfall…?

Leaves crunched under our feet. We stepped deeper in.

Then a voice called out,

“Alexander! Jonathan! You came!”

We froze.
We knew that voice.

Theo.

But we couldn’t see him at first. Turning left and right, before the voice called again.

“Look here!” he called again.
“We thought you’d never come!”

Just as Jonathan turned his head up to see, I grabbed his wrist.

He looked at me, confused. “...What?”

“The voice,” I whispered. “It’s coming from the tree.”

His face went pale. “...The tree?”

I nodded.
“The tree.”

The voice called again.
“Alexander? Jonathan?”

“Should we... leave the garden...?” I whispered.

Jonathan hesitated. “Without them?"

"We return with adults later.”

He seemed to consider it before agreeing. We ignored the calling and walked away.

“Are we doing the right thing?” I whispered.

“I think so… Just keep watching the ground-”

Above us-
Shuffling.
Movement.

A soft voice called,
“Boys... can you help me? Please look up... We need your help.”

We didn’t look. But we knew.
We felt it.

Dozens of heads, hanging from branches like fruit.
We could feel them smiling.

“Come on, guys! Look here!”

Jonathan grabbed my hand, about to run. I stopped him.

“Jonathan, second sign said not to run...!”

He nodded.
“We’re not running,” he said. “We’ll walk. Act normal.”

“Jon…” I whispered, my stomach dropped at the thought “Do you think… they’re…?”

He shook his head too fast. “No! No way. That’s not them. Those aren’t our friends!”

He pulled out his phone in a hurry, 

“I’ll call them. I’ll prove it.”

He dialed Daniel’s number while we walked forward. 

We were almost at the entrance when we saw him.

A tall- too tall -man,
Standing just past the gate.

And he picked up the call.

“...What the fu-” Jonathan muttered, his grip tightening on my wrist.

My heart slammed in my chest.

The third sign.

The tall man.

The smaller figures approaching.

The man raised the phone to his ear.

“Hello, Jonathan,” he said,
In Daniel’s voice.

I yanked Jonathan back, “End the call,” I hissed. “Now!”

We turned away from the entrance and walked deeper into the garden. Voices erupted around us.

Shouts. Laughter. Cries. Echoes.

None of them were clear.
But they all wanted one thing,

For us to look up.

“Alex! Jon!”

We flinched at the voice of Jordan.

We said nothing. Just walked faster. Anywhere but here.

Deeper into the woods. Suddenly,
Jonathan tugged me behind a tree.

“Jon-”

“Shhh.”

We crouched, holding our breath.

The tall man again. Roaming nearby.
Shovel in hand.

“What...? Wasn’t he at the entrance...?” I whispered.

Jonathan opened his mouth, 

Before he could start, a head hit the ground.
Rolled across the dirt. 
Eyes wide. 

Still smiling.
"Hey! Look here-! Please help me!" It said,

I almost screamed when I took a glimpse. Jonathan grabbed my arm tight.

And we saw the man approaching the head.

“No... nooo...”
He’d see us.

Who knows what would happen?

My breath faltered.
Tears welled in my eyes.

But Jonathan pulled me again, around the tree, out of that man's sight.

I looked at him, only to see his eyes also filled with fear, his shaking hands.
But still, he was focused.

Trying to save us both.

We kept moving behind, hiding behind one tree to another.

“Jon... do we head for the wall or the gate?” I asked, looking up at him. Since this place is surrounded by walls, there must be a place to climb.

He thought for a moment, “Back. Keep going back, that man is heading towards the entrance.”

We nodded.
Stuck together.

At last, after what felt like hours of walking—we reached the wall.
I almost cried.

Jonathan helped me up first, 

Just as I stood, I looked back.

The man was running toward us.

And the trees—
Oh God.

So many heads. Watching. Smiling.
Screaming.

“THEY ARE ABANDONING US!!”
“THEY SAW US AND WON’T SAVE US!!”
“THEY SHOULD BE BURIED HERE TOO!!”

The man sprinted with an uneven gait.
Shovel raised dangerously.

I pulled Jonathan up.

He was heavy, but I wouldn’t let go.

The shovel hit the wall beneath his feet.

He grabbed me—
I hugged him and leaned back, so we both fell.

But I hit my head, and it hurt like hell.

“Alex!” Jonathan caught me, holding me up.

Screams roared behind us.

Somehow...
We made it out.

Running throu more trees in the dark,

We stumbled to the road.
Gasping for air after running as much as we could. I looked at Jonathan, sitting on the ground and panting.

“Thanks, Alex…” Jonathan whispered.

I looked at him.
“...No. Thanks to you.” I sat beside him. "For you... I was able to live... If it weren't for you... I would've... looked..."

He shook his head. "I... can't lose another friend..."

He stared down at his fingers.

“We... couldn’t save them... we should have... gone with them...”
He covered his eyes after that. Yes, maybe if we had gone along, they might have followed the warnings. Maybe the three of them wouldn't have had to face any of it...

I sat beside him. I did not realize when my eyes got wet.


Since then, we’ve never gone back to abandoned or haunted places.

After a lot of investigation, police had found many headless bodies around the garden.

No heads found.

The killer, to this day, wasn't found.

The garden still thrives.
Even when it was destroyed, that place was not freed from its curse.

This is the Garden of Abandoned Ones, where people used to be killed, once they were abandoned by their people.

It has a big history, which I, nor Jonathan, wanted to dig into.

Since then, we grew closer to each other.
Only we shared the fear of looking up at trees with hesitation.
