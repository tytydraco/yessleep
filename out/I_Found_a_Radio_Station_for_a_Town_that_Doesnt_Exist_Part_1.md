One night, I was listening to the radio after work late one night I had gone to a fast food place to get something to eat, so I don’t wake up my housemates by making something. So, I was in the parking lot messing with the radios to find something interesting to listen to while I ate, when I came across a radio station with the number 06.13. I never heard of it, but I listened to it, out of curiosity.

It sounded like two guys, both with similar sounding voices, but one of them was more soft-spoken than the other. I caught the soft-spoken guy’s name: Spencer. The other one I didn’t catch.

It was a normal radio station with songs and ads being played, but it sounded like they talked more than played music. It sounded like they were talking to the Grave Falls listeners.

From memory, it went like this:

**Spencer**: “This song goes out to last month's Grave Falls’ missing children: Craig Lorenzo, Kayla Jenkins—” \**Papers rustling\**

**Other Man:** “Lucas Barclay, Mateo Lopez, Angela Lovelace, Henry Lovett, and Heather Brandice.”

They played a song that went about how some kid will never grow up. I couldn’t tell if that was a sick joke of some sort.

I did look up the names that I remembered but I couldn’t find any information on this Grave Falls place and missing children. I chalked it up to a stress-related hallucination…

But the next night I managed to find the 06.13 radio station again. This time, I recorded it with my phone. I tried to upload the recording to my laptop, but the video came out silent, for the entirety of it being recorded. I can still hear it on my phone, so here’s a transcript. Oh, I did manage to get Spencer’s co-host’s name: Teagan. Apparently they’re twins.

Here's the transcript of the recording:

**Little Girl:** “—And that’s why my pet tarantula, Dracula, is very interesting.”

**Teagan:** “Thanks for having your mother call into 06.13 – The Graveyard.”

**Natasha**: \**very cheerfully\** “Bye, Spencer, bye Teagan.”

**Spencer and Teagan**: \**in unison\** “Bye, Natasha.” \**phone call ends\**

**Spencer**: “So, if you find Dracula, a one foot-long orange and black tarantula, please capture it and return it back to \[*address redacted*\] so he and Natasha can be reunited. Natasha is going to give you a free pizza pass for Daisy’s Pizzeria for the safe return of Dracula.”

*\*some papers rustled\**

**Teagan:** “While you keep an eye out for Dracula, here is some music since we had taken up most of your time.”

\**music plays for about seven minutes before Rockwell's Somebody Is Watching Me gets interrupted \**

**Spencer**: “Sorry for the interruption, but get indoors immediately. I repeat, immediately. Lock your doors, windows, anything that can be used as an exit. Drag anybody or any pets you may have indoors. Go in the attic, basement, what have you, and do not, and I repeat, do not open for anyone that’s knocking and saying that they’re a loved one, begging to get indoors.”

**Teagan**: “Especially for the loved ones that you know are deceased.”

**Spencer**: “Good luck, everyone.”

**Teagan**: “And stay safe.”

There was nothing but silence for a long while after that. I found myself hoping that everything is okay.

&#x200B;

​The next night, I picked up 06.13 again. Thankfully everything seemed okay. Here's a recording transcript:

**Spencer:** "Good afternoon, everybody. Natasha would like to thank Daniel Sherman for the safe return of Dracula." \**a sound effect of applause plays\**

**Teagan:** "We hope that everyone was safe during the Lights in the Fog Event."

**Spencer**: "Unfortunately Maddox's Mattresses had its windows smashed in during the Event. In other news, Nicole McKenna and her younger siblings, Martin and Josephina had also gone missing after school the previous day. Go to our website to find resources on how to help the McKenna family through this terrible tragedy."

**Teagan**: "That's not all. The Halloween Festival is coming up in two weeks. My brother and I have a stall set up to see his Hellfire Salsa. It's hot as hell, but it tastes good. Devlin Moore also wants to advertise for his caramelized—"

**Spencer**: "Sorry to interrupt, but we're getting a caller."

**Teagan**: "Oh put them on."

\**After a few seconds\**

**Teagan**: "Hello, caller, you're on-air with 06.13 – The Graveyard. What's up?"

**Caller**: "I saw the Grave Robber take Nicole and her siblings."

The caller sounded like a young boy.

**Spencer**: "You did?"

He sounded like he did believe the boy and not at all that he was humoring the child.

**Caller**: "Yes. I saw Nicole and her siblings walking up when the Grave Robber took them. She didn't see me but I saw her. Nicole yelled at her not to take her siblings and take her instead. The Grave Robber took all of them."

**Woman**: \**From a distance*\* "Jimmy! What did I tell you about using the phone without permission?"

**Jimmy**: "I was just telling them about what I saw—"

\**Silence. Presumably the phone was hung up. After a few seconds of silence:\**

**Teagan**: "Hmm."

**Spencer**: "Well, that was something. Anyway, if you or anyone else has any information regarding the disappearance of Nicole, Martin, and Josephina, please call \[phone number redacted\]. Any information regarding their safe return will help."

**Teagan**: "Now, back to the Halloween Festival—"

I wasn't sure if this radio station was a prank of some kind, but I couldn't help but wonder: what is going on in that town? Who is the Grave Robber? What is the Lights in the Fog Event? Where is the missing? That was ten missing people in just two months.

More importantly, where is Grave Falls located since it's nearing the end of July where I live, yet Halloween is coming up in two weeks to them? It was night when I got on the radio station, yet it's the afternoon according to Spencer.

I guess I will listen to this radio station some more to find out more developments and keep you posted.
