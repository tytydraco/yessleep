“Part 1” https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/lXiFSrxJhY 

Growing up, our house was filled with warmth and laughter, thanks mostly to my mother. She was the kind who would leave sweet notes in my lunch box, and every night, without fail, she'd tell me stories of her own childhood until I drifted off to sleep. She was the cornerstone of our family, the guiding light. We were close, incredibly so. That's why, when she returned from her drive that night, the change was so glaringly obvious.

Finally, mustering the courage, I left my bed and slowly opened the door. The house was unsettlingly silent, as though the house itself was holding its breath. No sign of my mom.

The memories of the earlier incidents clouded my thoughts, like the time I found a sewing needle in my omelet or the cold, emotionless gaze she held when she tried to drown me in the sink. These memories gnawed at my sanity. The memories stirred a fear within me, a dread that she might be lurking in some shadowy corner of the house. Without hesitation, I sprinted out the front door and got into my car.

I shifted to reverse and sped out of the driveway, not once looking back. As the house shrunk in the rearview mirror, a weight seemed to lift off my shoulders. I called a friend telling them I needed a place to crash to for the night, not taking the time to explain everything that happened. 

But, just as that weight of relief lifted from my shoulders, it was immediately replaced with fear upon hearing a voice — one I can't forget.

"Honey, why are you leaving?"

It came from the back, specifically the trunk. It was my mother, if I can even call her that anymore. I glanced in the rearview mirror. Her eyes, grotesquely wide, stared back. They held no warmth, no motherly love — just a cold, predatory hunger.

Panic took over. Not thinking of the consequences, I flung the car door open and threw myself out, feeling the abrasive scrape of the concrete against my skin. The world seemed to spin endlessly until, with a jarring thud, I came to a stop. Lying on the ground, every breath felt like an impossible effort. 

The bright headlights of a passing car illuminated my battered form, and soon, kind hands were helping me, reassuring words offering solace, while calling for an ambulance. 

Later, in the hospital, the doctor informed me of my injuries. Turns out, I'd broken my left leg and fractured my hip. Thankfully none were life-threatening. The pain was a constant reminder of the ordeal, but the comfort of the hospital bed and the assurance of safety offered some respite. 

But then, an unmistakable sound broke the silence — seven soft, deliberate knocks on my hospital room door.

"You can't run anymore," my mother's voice whispered.

How did she find me? How did she know? 

I don’t have the strength to move. I fear these might be my last words. If anyone finds this, know that she is not my mother. She's something else, something far more sinister. Goodbye.
