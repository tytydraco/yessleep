I wished with all of my heart I could see the leaves fall, but the stone walls blocked the outside light.

The bunker was filled almost immediately after the catastrophe occurred on that fateful early morning. People panicked, some without direction. I'd say it would be safe to assume most of the population of earth had immediately been swept off of the ground from the near thousand mile an hour winds. The autumn trees were uprooted. Houses obliterated into loose shards of drywall and stucco. Skyscrapers didn't topple—they simply left the ground. Some rubble, at least, as far as the broadcasts told us, had even managed to reach escape velocity, and the earthquakes that registered off of the richter scale didn't help. The world that was readying itself for the coming winter had been obliterated.

People became aimless flying bags of flesh. Some got plastered over some well grounded wall, across a street, or ground through the remnants of an iron fence. Those of us who were lucky to survive were already below ground or underwater. Eventually, the remnants of local law and the military assisted us out of our hiding places. I remember seeing children being blindfolded when they entered so they didn't have to see the remnants of their neighbors covered in the brown leaves. I wasn't so lucky. All I managed was to pocket a torn leaf from some fallen tree. Perhaps it originated from where I stood, or it may have come from several miles away. I didn't care.

The radio became the centerpiece of everyone's nights. Inside the cramped sleeping quarters, it rested on a small center table, connected to a crude antenna somewhere above ground. We had managed to tune it to a news broadcast for updates, but I found listening to each one more and more laborious, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one. Whenever we'd leave it on through the sleepless nights, I'd watch my bunk neighbor's shoulders bob up and down underneath their thin covers as they sniffed. I sometimes found myself in similar positions, staring at the leaf I managed to grab. Its base rose to a fragmented top, the veins reaching out, unable to support anything.

One night, I had managed to get myself comfortable enough to almost fall asleep, but the radio caught my attention. It became more and more clear as time went on, removing the possibility of sleep from me. Defeated, I climbed the ladder of my bunk down to the center table. Nobody seemed to acknowledge my movements.

Though it had cleared up, the voice was still poorly received, but it was better than most nights of incoherent fuzz from the rushing wind. I tuned the radio with a ginger turn of the knob.

"...mapping of the whole of the catastrophe...to our understa..."

The static broke his speech. He sounded like a researcher above ground. His words were formal, delivered in a raised voice in an attempt to overpower the wind. I turned the knob once again.

"...ith our data points from our lost teams at ground zero, we've been able to map out the shape of the impact zo....he points on the map create the image of a..."

A what? I attempted to tune the radio for better audio, but the static didn't go away. After some time, the signal cleared again.

"...sualties range in the thousands!"

"Dammit!"

He had already moved on, and after listening further, he didn't elaborate on the being. I sat back in the creaky chair with my arms folded. The world had ended and we didn't even know what caused it.

"...ecently constructed satellite towers have returned with info about Earth's expected sunrise and sunset per area..."

How was this supposed to help? I turned in my chair to get back into my bunk, but the voice of the researcher continued, stopping me.

"...nrise and sunset is no longer a part of our broadcast on account of our telemetry data that axial rotation has completely ceased..."

My heart jumped. Earth had stopped spinning? Had anyone else heard about this? Why hasn't this been found out sooner? This certainly had to relate to the aforementioned impact zone, right? Was it a meteor? Another planet? The moon?

"The sun will not m...t's current position in the sky! Please stay indoors at th...ti..."

The radio had completely lost the signal. I sat back down in the chair, dumbfounded. The ceiling dripped on my face as I looked up. I wanted nothing more than to go back to my house and watch the changing colors of the leaves. I wanted to go back. Once this was all over, I could go back. Maybe once they tell us some good news, we all can go back. A frantic stir rose from my gut to my arms. I had to know more. Reaching for the knob, I rapidly turned it. The dial rapidly raced between channels, eventually resting on one as I picked up a signal.

This wasn't on the same channel as before. This was far and away more clear. A deep and confident voice spoke through the radio through the ceasing static.

"...s has been foretold by generations. Our time is nigh. All of the faithful whom I speak to, shirk not, for the fearful are the sinful. The raging typhoon of God's wrath will cease. Make no mistake, for God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for their iniquities, and today we see his hand. This season, the fall season, is called this for a reason. Are we not fallen? We have been returned to the dust of the Earth, even as Adam was, and we will rise with a higher and holier knowledge."

"What the hell?" I whispered,

"We must have faith, for the hand of God is upon us! He had come to take the faithful to stand at his right hand! The hand of God is upon us!"

I turned the dial once more, I needed the researcher back, not this zealot. But this was the only channel I could get anything from. I tuned back to the screaming static of the researcher's channel, his voice now drowning beneath the noise.

"...mpact zone...ximately three miles from broadcast stati...located in...radio tower has been damag...epeat, we are located in Dallas, Texas..."

Dallas? We were nearby. I felt the leaf in my pocket, remembering the zealot's words. I had to go see. If it was morning when we came in, it would be morning when I walked out.

The doors of the bunker scraped against the paved and cracked floor, catching on a raised piece of asphalt. I squeezed my way between the metal plates.

The outside air was completely still as the morning sky confirmed my theory. All was the same as when I entered. Nothing inhabited the air, not even the slightest particle of dust. I looked at the ground. Not even the piles of leaves were moving. As my eyes wandered, I had the unfortunate reminder of a completely decimated corpse to my left. Whomever it once belonged to has been gone for some time now, evidenced by the darker color of the blood. It didn't seem to be in pain though. It seemed more... defeated—finally allowed to rest from the catastrophe. The black hair of the corpse made no movement. I lingered for a moment before returning to the air around me once again.

If the wind had stopped, or further, if the air had completely stilled, why was the signal for the researcher so poor? I turned to walk up the hill the bunker had been dug into. As I reached the precipice, I was met with a mangled and broken piece of antenna. The entirety of the frame of the radio tower had crumbled under itself from the extreme wind. Despite the corpse of my lifeline outside resting at my feet, my attention sharply turned to the horizon with my new vantage point.

The blazing sun hung just above the horizon to the east, perfectly illuminating the outer Earth, yet human shape of the impact object. A massive hand that stretched its fingers to each end of the horizon gripped the ground with incredible force. It made no movement, much like the aftermath of the cataclysm it caused. I followed the shape of the forefinger fingertip, up the back of the hand, and up the arm as it stretched into the sky, all covered by increasingly more dense layers of atmosphere.

I stood, rooted in place. Pulling the leaf from my pocket, I took one last look at it before letting it fall. It didn't sway and swirl in the air. No, it fell like a dead weight. Straight down, onto the dying grass.
