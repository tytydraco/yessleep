I can’t remember the last time I slept. Was it four days ago? Maybe five? I keep seeing these things… stalking me. Haunting me. Wherever I go. They want me to do that thing but I refuse. They will not win. I know they can’t physically hurt me, but by God they are trying to exhaust me mentally… so I can do it.

When did it start? Ah yes, that day. That typical Monday work day, running eye exam after another in my clinic in small town, USA.

Shut up! You’re the stupid one!

Oh yes, right. I remember it so vividly. Go to my car at 7:24am. Get to clinic by 7:45am. Prepare clinic. Say “Hello” to Patricia as she enters the door and preps the waiting room and eyeglasses. Wait for patients to arrive when clinic opens at 8:30am.

That day. Oh that day was quiet. Very quiet. Only in the evening though. No appointments. Just the one walk-in. That man. Opened that door at 3:47pm. Asked if walk-in is possible. Patricia said yes. I said yes. That’s a win-win right? Wrong!

I do the usual spiel. I ask him his name, medical history, any previous prescriptions, anything bothering his eyes. His answers told me he was in perfect health. Thinking about it now, he was in perfect health, for something not human. Hehehe!

First thing I always do, tell them to read letters of the Snellen chart. You know? That one picture that every eye doctor has on the wall? Good. I am glad you know that. This guy did it perfectly. 20/20 vision. So I ask him, “Why do you need an eye exam?” And he said, “I need it as my superior requires a record of my eye health.” Perfectly reasonable response.

So next, I tell him to sit in a special chair and look inside a special machine. While he looks at that shiny dot that moves from place to place, I check that his eyes move properly. This is the eye muscle movement test. I see something in his eyes. It’s really strange. Like there’s almost no iris there. Only a pupil. A large pupil as black as the void. Well, except it isn’t black, I can make out shapes. Weird shapes.

I pried at him a little and asked, “Your eyes look strange, what work do you do? Do your eyes bother you?” And he replied, “I used to work as an optics researcher at a government institute. Before the accident. Now, I guess you can say… I am on holiday.”

I pried a little more. “Accident?” I said, “Do you mind explaining?” And he responded, “Well, I was studying a beautiful crystal with two useless helpers. And then machinery went wrong and now I have this eye issue that you’re seeing. I blame the helpers. I am looking for them.”

What? You said something? No? Then shut up!

Wait. Where was I? Oh yes. I type in the computer: Eye movement is perfect. I also told him that. Then I tell him, “I will cover your eye with a machine, then uncover it to see if your eyes are okay or have other issues.”

I did that. This is the cover test. When I covered and uncovered his right eye… I see something in his pupil. Only faintly. It had patterns upon patterns in it. A fractal? Yes. That’s what it’s called. Have you ever seen the Apollonian gasket? No? Okay.

Imagine, if you will, circles within circles, endlessly spiraling into the abyss. The Apollonian gasket, they call it. It's like a madman's doodle, never-ending, never complete. You start with a big circle, then you cram in smaller circles, and then even smaller ones, and so on, forever! Each circle snugly fits into the gaps left by the others, like some cosmic jigsaw puzzle. It's beautiful, it's maddening! Patterns upon patterns, repeating, shrinking, but never disappearing. It's like staring into infinity, where the void stares back at you, whispering secrets of the universe. Can you see it? Can you feel it? The endless dance of geometry, mocking your sanity!

But then, it goes away. Gone! I thought I was imagining it. That I was going crazy. But… I wasn’t. But back then, I dismissed it. And moved on to the next eye. I fell off my chair that day. Hit my head I did. I didn’t go night-night though.

I saw in that eye, a monolith. Surrounded by blackness. A monolith, with what looked like someone trapped in it. That trapped man was suffering. His body… it writhed, it morphed, it transformed in inhuman ways. All the while he was silently screaming.

That man in the monolith… was standing right in front of me. When I fell, he looked at me. Emotionless. Like a robot.

Then he said, “You saw him. My old self. Trapped in a world beyond your mortal understanding. But you saw him. So you passed the test. Take this crystal. It will tell you secrets beyond your wildest imagination. Show you your… destiny.”

By God he was gentle. He placed the crystal in my right pocket. It felt cold, hard, like ice. It looked like just any quartz pillar that you can buy at any hippie healing shop, except it was as black as his eyes.

Then he said, “You must hold this crystal with both hands and stare at it until it appears to you. You will know it when you see it. If you don’t do this soon, then it will do it for you.”

That’s when he left. That’s when I fell asleep.

I still have it, you know. See? It’s in this bag. This thing, it summons other things. Things that just don’t make sense. They follow you, but they ain’t human. They change shape and patterns to something otherworldly. I remember seeing one of them on the street. Looked human at first, then their head suddenly formed more heads, and heads, and more heads. Like that gasket I told you about. It can make a person mad. Except I ain’t. Well, maybe I am.

It’s not just the heads. Sometimes, I see their limbs split and multiply, like branches of a tree, but twisted and wrong. They move in ways that defy logic, bending and folding into themselves, creating new forms that shouldn’t exist. I saw one of them in my clinic once, standing in the corner, its body fracturing into countless smaller versions of itself, each one staring at me with those same void-like eyes.

And the walls… oh, the walls. They breathe. They pulse with a life of their own, patterns emerging and receding, like the Mandelbrot set, infinite and unending. I can see the shapes, the spirals, the endless repetition. It’s like the clinic is alive, mocking me with its silent, rhythmic dance.

Even the shadows aren’t safe. They twist and writhe, forming intricate patterns on the floor and walls. I saw one shadow split into a thousand tiny tendrils, each one reaching out, trying to touch me. They move with a purpose, an evil intelligence that I can’t escape.

I feel it. One day it will beckon. But I won’t answer, you hear me? I might have days, weeks, or even months to live. But hear me, when that day comes. Pop! I will be dead.

You doubt me? Just you wait. I will do it. I promise you.
