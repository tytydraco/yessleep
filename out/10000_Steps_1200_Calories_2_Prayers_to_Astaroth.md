Trainers will tell you that you can’t outrun a fork. The same principle applies to demons. For the first time in my life I have abs, but I can never look in a mirror again.


I’m not an idiot, I tried other things first. Keto wasn’t sustainable. I ate through the Ozempic. The gym is full of the sorts of people who join a gym.  So I kept losing and gaining the same 20 pounds Until we had a weight loss contest at work. 


It wasn’t my health or self esteem that motivated me to lose the weight. It was wanting to beat Kelsey, the office sociopath. She was a monster, but she didn’t deserve what I did to her. 


None of them did. 

Kelsey was insufferable before the biggest loser contest. She was technically in customer service, but somehow was never on the phone. Instead she patrolled the cubicle rows randomly insulting people.  I wasn’t even going to sign up for the stupid contest until she popped up at my cube, droning on in her sing-song voice: “OMG isn’t it the worst that they are doing this contest now?!? They should have done it in October, then you wouldn’t have looked like pregnant Batman at the Halloween party…JK!! You looked amazeballs.”


Ugh, Kelsey.


The first weigh-in after we started Kelsey was down 12 lbs in a week and was babbling to anyone who would listen about protein macros and fasted cardio. I was pretty sure she dropped water weight from stealing her kid’s Adderall. She was sweating through her makeup (which was basically Mary Kay war paint) and her pupils were the size of bottle caps. 


There was no way I could beat her playing fair. So I didn’t.


My great-grandmother Oma Rabeler lived to 104, and even at the end, she wasn’t sick, just bored. That’s what my aunts said anyway. Family stories about Oma ranged from mostly true to straight up Pennsylvania Dutch folklore.  I heard all about how her rye cream cured my uncle’s acne overnight, and her special Boilo drink made my mom’s migraines go away. They even said that she saved a neighbor who had been in a house fire by healing his burns. 


The one thing I saw myself was the special diet. She did it for my cousin  when she didn’t fit her wedding dress. Oma did a prayer and gave her some stew to eat and she legit was 30 pounds lighter in two days. Oma did the diet herself, maybe once a year or so, just for a day, and was never bigger than a size two.


I went to my family’s  house and found Oma’s journals. The directions for the diet prayers and recipe were in German, on brittle old parchment, and not in her handwriting. It was titled Gebet zum Asteroth. The warning after it was English, and definitely Oma’s blunt block letters:


“DO NOT USE PAST TWO DAYS. DO NOT LOOK IN THE MIRROR WHEN USING. THE CLOSING PRAYER MUST BE READ BY THE SECOND SUNDOWN. IF YOU SEE THE ELWETRISCH STOP IMMEDIATELY. 


I used Google translate for the recipe, but left the prayers. I didn’t want to know what I was saying. 

I felt guilty doing this. Nobody else in the contest was augmenting their cardio with powwwow spells. Ever since I was a kid I was fixated on fairness, by everyone playing by the same rules. Being a rule follower didn’t exactly set me up for success in sales, which explained why I was struggling to make my numbers while Eddie and Martin (my morally flexible colleagues) were competing to see who could buy the tackiest luxury watch.  I didn’t want to cheat to win a stupid contest. But I just really needed Kelsey to lose. 


Two days before the contest weigh-in I said the first prayer and made the stew. The ingredients were weird (no I won’t list them) and combined to taste like a very salty pile of wet leaves. 


At the end of the first day I was down 15 pounds, and stayed up all night organizing sales leads, then emails, then my sock drawer. At the end of day 2 I was down 30 and none of my clothes fit. That should have been it. Second prayer and done. I didn’t say the prayer. I stayed up again doing dumbbell workouts and thinking of ways to sabotage Eddie and Martin. 


The weigh-in on the third day felt too good. The look on Kelsey’s face was delicious. And I was making more calls and closing more sales than I ever had before. I wanted it to keep going.  

I was forgetting things though. I had to reset my computer password with IT two days in a row because I didn’t write it down. I chalked it up to blood sugar.  After I got my password figured out I contacted quality assurance about Martin lying on his underwriting, and sent proof.


I made another batch of stew on my lunch break. 

The extra burst of energy got me through stealing, calling, and closing Eddie’s leads. That night I did a cardio walk for three hours while trying to remember my childhood address.  I didn’t panic, lots of people get brain fog on a diet. 


Finally, at the end of the fourth day, I looked in the mirror.

My body and face were unrecognizable. I was impossibly lean, skin pulled tight over long-buried muscles, like leather stretched over steel. And I wasn’t alone.  

A nightmarish bird had its talons in my shoulders. 

It was feeding on me.


The Elwetrisch was not what they told me it was as a kid, not a creepy-cute bird cryptid.


It was a hateful perversion of a chicken. Instead of feathers it had greasy black scales. Its eyes were malevolent violet orbs. Antlers rose out of its forehead and gored my… aura, I guess? 

Somehow I knew that the shimmering colors around my reflection were part of what made me. And the beast was gnawing on me, pecking furiously with a leathery beak.

It wasn’t just eating the fat. It was eating my soul.

I immediately read the second prayer and threw out the remaining stew. I went to bed and spent the night sleepless, rocking back and forth. What else had it eaten? My conscience, clearly. What memories? I shook, quizzing myself. Did I remember my parents? Yes. Their names, anyway.  I couldn’t picture their faces. My siblings and cousins were fuzzy. It was like trying to remember a dream. 

In the morning I didn’t look in the mirror but I accidentally saw my reflection in the chrome toaster. The elwetrisch wasn’t feeding, just hovering, angrily. 

That afternoon security stood by Martin’s desk while he put his personal belongings in a box. I felt nothing but realized that the me from five days ago would have been crushed with guilt.  But if I was the me from five days ago, Martin would still have a job.  That me wasn’t coming back, just like Martin.

I wondered if maybe I might revert back to my old nice self now that the prayers were said and I was back on normal food(small salads,my appetite wasn’t what it used to be).  Then Kelsey came to my desk.

“You absolutely must share your diet with me,” she said. There was no single-song voice this time. She was sincere.

The next morning I read the prayer over Kelsey’s desk silently as I gave her two days worth of stew. I almost didn’t give her the recipe. Almost.


“Here are the directions if you really think you want more. but remember not to overdo it,” I said. 


Technically I warned her, right?

That was on a Thursday. She didn’t come in on Friday. I’d like to think that if she had, I would have done the second prayer.  I’d like to think that. 

On Monday she showed up to work looking like a zombie that worked at Sephora: foundation and blush caked over hollowed cheeks and bulging orbital bones.  She didn’t show up on Tuesday. Or ever again.


Her funeral was the day of the final weigh-in.  


I ended up winning $500 from the prize pool for the contest. That was nothing compared to the commission I was going to make that month with Martin out of the company and his leads in my pocket. Eddie probably would have been suspicious about the leads I swiped from him, but he had other things to worry about. Someone sent screenshots of his instant messages with his assistant to his wife. He left the company soon afterwards.

My memories didn’t come back, but they didn’t get worse after the second prayer. Same with my conscience. I haven’t degenerated into being a super villain, but you wouldn’t want to be on a sales team with me. 

The real problem is the reflections. And not just my own. I have seen other things in people’s computer screens, and phones, and tablets. I won’t go near a public restroom mirror. It isn’t just me. Everyone is surrounded by entities all the time. Most are just watching, but they all seem eager to feed. Many  people have the sense that something is watching them. Especially people with addictions. The one time I saw something feeding was in the reflection of my boss’s desktop, right after he started drinking again.

So I’m living with the knowledge that the Elwetrisch is lurking behind my shoulder. And I’m mostly at peace with that. Except…


Keeping the weight off is a lot harder than losing it was. So is keeping up my sales numbers. As sick as it sounds,  I miss how those first two days felt.  I miss it enough to think that maybe this time I can control it. Just one day. Maybe two. 


I don’t want anyone to get hurt again. But abs are made in the kitchen.
