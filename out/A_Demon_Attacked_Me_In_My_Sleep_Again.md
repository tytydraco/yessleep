Hey guys, this will be my second post of a horrible dream I just had last night. I wanted to share it while it was fresh in my mind but it woke me out of a deep sleep. 

Firstly, to understand this dream, you need to know that I was in a relationship with my ex for 2 years before we split 2 months ago. We broke up due to adultery and cheating, he took it pretty hard and he left me. Fast forward to last night, everything in my dream seemed normal at first, he was in a new relationship (a polyamorous one with 3 partners in one relationship) and I was still single in my dream. For some reason, he comes over to my house where my mom and I were residing. Something followed him there…

A bunch of random things happened in and out of this dream, a fight him and I had while he was collecting his belongings he had left behind from the breakup, while he returned to his new partners’ house to drop them off and come back to pick up more items, a strange man that stopped by to give me money weirdly enough, etc. But this part gave me chills. 

Every time my ex was around, our phones would ring. There would be a creepy male voice, which he thought was his current partner, trying to get in contact with him. It sounded just like his partner, except it kept asking us the same question: “Is he coming home yet?” Something to that nature. Nothing more, just an eerie male voice asking that same question over and over, even if we would hang up, it would call back. Super freaky.

We’ve all seen the movie “Smile” where the freaky demon haunts your day-to-day waking life and eventually unalives you in the end. Yeah, this demon was fucked up like that. During one of his last visits to reclaim his possessions, my mom’s house phone rings. We don’t think much of it at first, as my ex and I were gathered on the couch in the living room, organizing his things, when we hear my mom in the kitchen saying “he’s here gathering his stuff from my house”. My ex and I stop and look at each other in concern, then up at my mom. “Do you want to talk to him?” She asks. Silence. She emerges from the kitchen and into view from the living room and looks up in horror, frozen in fear for a few seconds. We instinctively know it’s the demon terrorizing us again. She motions with her hands, unable to speak, for one of us to grab the phone. It asks her again while I scramble to get the phone, “is he coming home yet?”

I take the chance and answer. I put the phone to my ear and the same voice beckons itself back in, “is he coming home yet?” Now, in my dream, you have to remember that this voice and these phone calls have been happening to my ex and I all day, so this drove me off the deep end and I screamed “leave us alone! He’s not coming back!” This seemed to anger or amuse the voice on the phone because it started laughing and its voice starting shifting from male to distorted, gasp-like chuckles and grunts. It asks one more time, this time in a much deeper, more angered voice “IS HE COMING HOME YET?!” I hung up.

It called once more but the phone would not stop ringing, no matter how long we waited for it to go to voicemail. My ex answers this time and puts it on speaker, my mom and I watch in horror and confusion as the voice spoke. “If you hang up on me again, I’ll come for you instead.” I was shocked and horrified. My ex looked up at me in concern, then back down to the phone resting on the coffee table and asked “what do you want from us?” The voice replied, “I want you to be dead by morning, if you aren’t then I will come for (let’s just call myself Alex) which the voice was talking about myself. The demon then started pretending like it was my ex’s new partners having sex on the other line, moaning and making sexual sounds on the end of the line, trying to coax him to come home to join the fun. It was truly disturbing but my ex was not convinced and said “you’re not really them, why are you doing this?” To which point the demon returned to its devilish deep, distorted voice and just started cackling again in the most horrific ways.

I began to have morbid curiosity and asked the voice “what do you look like?” The voice chuckled a creepy ass laugh and replied “I come in many shapes and sizes, but for now, if you want to know what I look like, go to your bedroom” (which was located down the hall). I’m not quite sure why this part happened, but I just automatically start making my way down the dark, silent hallway towards my bedroom. Just when I reach the doorknob to my room, at this point I’m so freaked out that I woke up in a sweat out of my dream. 

Honestly I was so relieved to wake up because I did NOT want to see what the entity looked like. It was trying to separate me from the small group we assembled and get me alone in a room. Instinctively, I knew it looked like the demon from the movie “Smile” (if you haven’t seen it it’s a great movie) but the dream version of myself had no idea what it looked like, if that makes sense. Either way, I don’t want to know what the demon’s intentions were for me, or any of us for that matter.
