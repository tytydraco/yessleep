I had a weird dream last night... 

Or at least I think it was a dream.

It didn't feel like one, looking back at it. Maybe it was from my lack of rest, or it could’ve been influenced by the podcast I was listening to, Creepcast lol. I fell asleep earlier than usual, around 7pm, but that was because the night before I didn’t go to bed at all. Me and sleep tend to have a love/hate relationship. 

Anyway, about that dream. I remember falling asleep at my desk that night, I stream on weekends and was planning on doing a surprise stream since it was Monday and I was a bit bored. After I had booted up my OBS and needed to decide which game to play. My choices were alien isolation and the crooked man. I remember closing my eyes to think for a minute. Obviously I never made it to stream, because I ended up passing out crisscross in my chair. 

When my dream started I was laying in bed, my body facing the wall and the room was dark. For you to understand why this dream was weird I’ll explain what my bed normally looks like. It’s a queen size with only a fitted sheet and thick blue blanket, I have some laundry that I hadn't put away yet (don't judge) and a couple large boba plushies, all at the bottom of the bed. I only have one pillow which is square because it helps with neck support while I sleep. Other than that I don’t have anything else on my bed. 

Well, during my dream, I was laying there and had barely opened my eyes to see 3 lanky white plushies with dark cloaks on, sitting upright next to me. I didn’t recognize them and started to feel a little uncomfortable. I get claustrophobic easily, hence why everything is usually at the edge of the bed or somewhere else like my closet. I decided to pick them up and throw them to the bottom with the others. After I threw them down weakly, 3 more appeared, almost like they fazed into existence. They weren’t the same ones I threw because they were all different shapes and sizes. I found that odd but I was too tired to care enough and tried throwing them again. 3 more materialized. I got annoyed and gave up on moving them, so I turned over, thinking I had more room on my right side. I was wrong. About 12 more sat in an upright position like the others, all facing me, like they could see me. You know that feeling you get when you can tell someone is staring at you? 

Well, I started to feel that, but not from the dolls. 

It was starting to get harder to breathe so I sat up and decided to go get some water or something. As I stumbled out onto the floor, I felt the air thicken, like there was a presence coming from my closet and the area near my door. My body went cold and I could feel the bottoms of my feet freeze up. My eyes were still blurry, so all I could see was the fuzy outline of my room and something big and dark in the corner. The voice in the back of my head told me "ignore it, go lay back down. It doesn't like to be looked at." So I did. I climbed over the mountain of dolls, or plushies, whatever they were, and plopped my head back on the pillow. I don't know why, but I remember I had checked my phone for the time, it said 1:13am. As I laid there, covered in strange plushies and my blanket, I felt the dark figure moving in closer and closer at a slug's pace. I remember hoping it would just evaporate and disappear, or even go back inside the closet (I'm guessing that's where it came from). But it just kept inching it's way over, till it's shadow covered my entire bed. I stayed quiet and closed my eyes tight. In my mind, I imagined its sharp claws twitching, aching to swipe at anything with a pulse. 

Why it didn’t in that moment, is still a mystery to me.

I woke up a little after that, sweating and overheating, which doesn't usually happen considering it gets pretty drafty in my room this time of year. I checked the time on my phone, 2:13am. Creepcast was still playing in the background, some story about a woman being taken over by a mimic or something. I started to remember what I was doing before I fell asleep and pulled the covers off my body. Confusion hit me when I realized I was in my bed, remembering I had fallen asleep at my desk.

I don't have a history of sleepwalking, and I don't really know enough about it to rule it out as a possibility. My bed was exactly how I had left it, my room was exactly how I left it, other than my closet door being open. But how and when did I move from the desk to my bed? My phone was even on the charger and everything. I feel like I'm going a little stir crazy because not only do I not remember laying down, I don't remember opening my closet door either. 

So much is throwing me off about that night. The dream was so real, it felt like I had actually moved those plushie things, like I had actually gotten up out my bed and felt the cool floor on the pads of my feet. And what was that dark figure, or shadow, or whatever? Either way, I think I am going to sleep on the couch tonight. If anyone has had surreal dreams or been through something similar, or has some kind of advise or input, I would really appreciate some feedback. 

I don't know what to do. If anything happens again, I guess I'll update this post.
