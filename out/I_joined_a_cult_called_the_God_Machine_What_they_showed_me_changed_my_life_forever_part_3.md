In the chaos that followed, I heard only screams and the ripping of flesh. I had found Mary in the press of bodies and pushed her forward, towards the edge of the crowd.

“We have to get out of here,” I said, sweat pouring down my forehead. She nodded, her face pale and anxious. I glanced back at the monster that Archon had called on before his death. Her backwards face on her broken neck stared directly at me, an inhuman grin spreading across her face. I turned towards the complex, hoping to find refuge somewhere in there before I could get the hell away from here. At this point, I didn’t care about my assignment or finding Chrissy, or her body, for her wealthy family. No amount of money could convince me to stay here for another minute.

Yet the complex wasn’t there, and neither were the lights of the town on the hill beyond. Something had changed rapidly when the ritual went wrong. This side of the shore had somehow transformed into an extension of the otherworldly city I had seen on the farther side. More pyramids and statues extended hundreds of stories into the air. Wind-swept sandstone streets lead into narrow alleyways and past golden spires. Sacrificial temples with statues of unspeakable creatures in their antechambers flashed by. Some of the statues showed huge, tentacled abominations with reptilian wings and powerful muscles. Others showed the Angel of Death, her head twisted backwards. And a few showed things that I couldn’t even comprehend, less likely communicate.

As we sprinted down the avenue of temples and statues, I looked back one last time to see the Angel of Death far behind us. She was approaching another cultist, a young woman. The Angel’s skeletal hands reached into the cultist’s chest. With a spray of blood, I saw the cultist’s heart being taken out. Reaching around her own twisted, sickly body, the Angel of Death opened her mouth wide and took the organ, still beating and dripping blood, into her gaping mouth. I saw the bloody red eyes of the Angel roll back in pleasure as she chewed, letting rivulets of blood drip down her pale skin and soak into the rags she wore.

Mary’s soft hand found mine, and she pulled me away. Like a hypnotized person, I stumbled, still staring back at the horrors that these cult members had unleashed. And then we ran into the city.

Soon we found ourselves alone, the screaming and cries behind us fading rapidly. We sprinted down the main street for what felt like miles. A dry, desert wind blew through the ancient city. I didn’t see another living soul in the massive place.

“What now?” I said, panting, bent over. Mary had stopped too, breathing hard. She looked like she might fall over. I put my hand on her shoulder, steadying her. She started to cry.

“I don’t know,” she said. “My brother is dead. Something must have gone wrong with the ritual. This has never happened before. Usually the Angel just takes the dead bodies we give her and leaves. She always whispered something in Enochian to Archon on her way out, something he would write down in a journal. A few times, though, she also brought living people back with her.” My eyes widened.

“Living people? Why?” This disturbed me far more than anything else she had said. But Mary just shrugged, wiping a few tears from eyes and straightening up. She seemed to rapidly regain her bearings.

“I’ve asked Archon, and he has no idea. But, if they’re still alive, they should be somewhere in this city.” I nodded, wondering. I had a terrible feeling about the entire thing. Why would these ancient or immortal beings need living humans?

“Did you know a woman named Chrissy?” I asked, thinking back to the meeting with her family in my little office a few days previously, though it felt like months ago now. They showed me some photographs of her. I had a couple copies in my car, but that did me no good. “A pretty brunette, tall, hair parted in the middle, has piercings all up and down her ears.” Mary looked at me suspiciously.

“Yes, I know her, or should I say, knew her,” Mary said. “She was one of the living ones the Angel of Death took back with her. A sacrifice of sorts, I guess, She had been gagged and drugged by Dax and the others in charge. Apparently, Chrissy was going to leave and spread the news of what we had to the entire world, including the suspicious deaths caused by the God Machine and the Angels. Most of all, she thought everyone should know that we could prove the existence of God. They tried talking her out of it, and she had acted like she agreed, but later the same week, one of the sentries on the edge of the property caught her trying to sneak out in the middle of the night. That was when they decided that she was a loose end who needed to be dealt with.

“I never supported any of this, you understand,” Mary said, pleading, her expression sad and slightly angry, “but they don’t listen to me.” I felt sick to my stomach. We kept running.

“Do you have any idea how to get back to our world?” I asked between panting breaths. I was getting tired and would soon need to rest. Mary shrugged.

“I think if we took the Angel of Death’s boat back to the farther shore, it would bring us where we wanted. The old myths say that the boat is itself a conscious, living entity, and that if you tell it where you want to go, it will take you there. Or maybe you just have to think it. I don’t know.” Mary stopped, bent over. “I need a break.”

From behind us, high in the air, we heard a banshee-like shrieking, followed by a hissing noise. I looked up and saw the twisted face of the Angel of Death. She had unfurled a pair of black, rotting wings. In her hands, she held Dax.

“Oh my God, Dax!” Mary cried instinctively. The Angel’s backwards-facing head snapped to our location, looking down on us from dozens of stories in the air. She dropped Dax. He screamed the entire way down. With a sickening crunching of bone, he landed on the sandstone street a few hundred feet behind us. The Angel languidly pumped her wings, hovering for a moment. Then she began to chase us.

“Where do we go?!” Mary asked. I looked around. Next to us was a temple with a statue of a huge human with horns and terrible, black eyes. Its hands and feet were clawed and animalistic, and it had a grin of pure sadism and lunacy carved into its face.

From behind the statue, through the antechamber, I heard the echoes of a cry for help. It was in English, and it was clearly a woman.

“Here!” I said, getting under the cover of the marble entrance as fast as I could. At least in here, I thought to myself, the Angel of Death can’t come down on us from the skies.

The antechamber led to a room that was so large, I couldn’t see the ceilings or the far wall. Torches lined the perimeter. In the middle, a bed had been set up, something that looked like it had been plucked straight out of ancient Rome. 

Inside the massive chamber, I heard crying of such abject pain that I thought it was some sort of monster, that I had been fooled into thinking it was a human. But as I looked closer, I realized that a half-naked woman lay on the bed, looking extremely pregnant, her legs swollen and her face round. Though she looked far different than the pictures I had been shown, I knew instantly who it was.

“Chrissy,” I said. She looked up, her face drenched in sweat. She gritted her teeth.

“Please,” she said, “kill me.” Then, as I watched, something inside her belly began to move, shoving its face and hands into the skin of her belly. With horror, I watched the skin begin to rip, sending rivers of blood running down her body and drenching the stone floors below.

“What is that?!” Mary screamed. “What is inside her body?!”

“The angels,” Chrissy said, her pupils dilating as her adrenaline spiked and she bled to death, a pallor overtaking her skin, “want human women for sex. It is a Nephilim. It grew so fast, and now…” Her words dissolved into sobs and screaming. The small claws of the hand started to rip the muscles and organs of its mother. She rapidly lost consciousness as liters of blood flowed from her shredded arteries and veins.

What came out of her body was indescribable. Its horns were as long as its head, curving back and around like the horns of a ram. Its eyes were sheer black, its pupils no more than slits. It had a kind of soft, downy hair that covered its naked body. Disengaging its jaw like a snake, it showed dozens of fangs and began to run at us.

Though it was much larger than any human baby, it still wasn’t yet as fast. We turned and sprinted out of the temple, hearing the soft pitter-patter of its feet fall further and further behind. Once we reached the entrance, I held out a hand to Mary.

“It’s not following us anymore,” I said. “Listen.” She cocked her head to one side, then nodded.

But back in the chamber far away, we heard the sounds of ripping meat and chewing. The beast birthed from a combination of human and angel was consuming its own mother.

“Well,” I said, frowning, “we can’t go in and we can’t go out. What now?”

As if hearing my question, the Angel of Death flitted down slowly in front of the entrance, her face turned towards us, grinning from ear to ear. Blood still stained her teeth and chin. She whispered something in that hissing language Archon had called Enochian, then changed to broken English.

“More food,” she said. “More fools who think they can call us like dogs. You aren’t leaving here… ever.” Her wings began to beat furiously, taking her back off the ground. The smell of rot emanated from her wings, mixing with the dry desert smell carried on the wind. Mary and I tried to get around her, but like a reptile grabbing an insect from the air, her arms shot out in a blur and grabbed us both by our necks. She cackled, a grating, hissing sound that filled me with fear.

She began to squeeze so hard that I saw stars. My vision began to turn white. I felt sticky blood running down the back of my shirt where her claws were digging into my skin.

And then, just as I thought all hope was lost, the Nephilim ran out. He was already much larger, likely from eating the body and drinking the blood of his own mother as a first meal. He stood as tall as a man, but was still naked, the downy covering over his body still showing. With a blur, he crashed into all three of us, causing the Angel of Death to drop us. I went flying, hitting the sandstone streets and getting the wind knocked out of me. Mary flew and hit the wall of the entrance, crumpling into a ball. I groaned.

A cacophony of shrieks and rending flesh began immediately behind me. With a foggy head, blinking fast, I saw the Nephilim tearing into the Angel of Death. His clawed hands scored deep gouges in her back. Her mouth opened wide, and she bit into his shoulder. He let out a scream that shook the dirt from the buildings. 

It was so deafening that my ears were ringing. It was more like a high-pitched siren than any human scream, and likely had as much power as one.

Crawling slowly, I went over to Mary. She was just opening her eyes, looking dazed. I slapped her gently on the face a couple times.

“Mary, Mary,” I whispered. “Can you hear me?” She blinked fast, then awareness returned to her eyes. She stared straight at me.

“This is our one chance,” I said, getting close to her ear. “We need to get to the boat *now.*” She nodded, standing up on wavering legs, and we began to move as fast as we could back in the direction we had come.

The shrieks of battle between the Angel of Death and the Nephilim followed us back the entire time. I tried to block it out, thinking only of getting home.

Finally, after hobbling along as fast as we could, I saw the river up ahead. Dead cult members were strewn all over the ground. Some had their chests ripped apart, while others had their heads snapped off. A few had their necks broken, their faces turned completely around, just like the Angel of Death’s.

Trying not to look, we hopped into the boat, and I grabbed the oars. I began to paddle.

“Boat, bring us back to Earth. Bring us to the God Machine, the place in the town of Union where we came from,” I said, hoping it would work. But, for good measure, I also *thought* of Earth. I thought of that building, the poems all around it, the paintings, the beds, the cafeteria.

Up ahead, the floating pyramids and huge temples seemed to waver, looking for a moment like mirages in the desert. Then they disappeared, and the complex came into view. I sighed heavily. Mary hugged me, laughing and crying at the same time.

As soon as we were on the shore, I jumped out, helping her do the same. And we got out of there, vowing never to return to that place again.

I might have failed to bring back the body of Chrissy, but at least now, I can tell her parents what happened to her.

But who would ever believe me?
