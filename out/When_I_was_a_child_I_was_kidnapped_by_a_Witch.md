I’ve spent a lot of years in therapy. That’s common for abducted kids. My therapist tried to get me to join a support group, too. Bond over shared trauma. I tried but it didn’t work. We didn’t share trauma. Don’t get me wrong they’d been through some fucked up shit. Some of them a lot worse than me. But none of them had dealt with anything like Her.



I learned early on not to be honest about Her, even with the doctors. At first they would nod with grim understanding, but as time went on it turned to concern. Then disbelief. Then irritation. So, I learned what to leave out. What to explain away in terms they’d accept. 



I’ve been lying to my doctors and my family for near forty years now. Even my kids only know the official story. I’d like someone to know the truth. Someone who might believe me. Maybe even someone whose been through something similar. 



It all started when I was eight years old. The haze of memory is thick and some things stand out all too clearly, while others have blurred at the edges. I was eight years old; I know I was eight when it happened because it says it in all the reports. Eight. 



It was back in the eighties. My dad was driving too fast down the motorway while mum and I sang along to *Everybody wants to rule the world*. Well, mum sang, I really only knew the chorus. Dad tapped the beat on the steering wheel and I was so sure this was going to be the best holiday ever. 



Whit week. That’s the name for the school holidays at the end of May, not that it really matches with Whit Sunday anymore. But that’s what it was. It was Whit week, and we were going north to visit my dad's sister in Leicestershire. 



It was a six hour drive and we’d left at 7am on the dot. Mum had made us jam sandwiches and a flask of tea for the trip and we’d stopped for a crib and to enjoy the view. I remember being desperate for a wee later on. Just bursting. Dad wouldn’t stop, of course, said I should have gone when we ate. 



We arrived at my aunt’s house late in the day, after 5pm. I never have understood how the six hour drive inevitably took us ten, but it always did. Mara, my aunt, greeted my father with a hug and my mother with a cold nod. I never learned the cause of the animosity between them, but it was always restrained during visits. Auntie Mara pulled me into a hug; in years gone she would sweep me up and squeeze me tight, but I was already a big lad by eight and more than she could lift with her condition. 



That night was quiet. We ate lamb chops and boiled veg and it felt like a feast. Mara didn’t have a large house but she made do at keeping us in comfort. Since last year I’d been given the spare bedroom which only had a single bed, while my parents slept on a pull-out in the front room. 



I felt so special getting my own room on holiday. There was a little desk with a lamp and I sat there until almost ten o’clock reading *Voyage of the Dawn Treader* which I’d received as an Easter present. Normally mum didn’t approve of fantasy, but she made an exception for Narnia. 



I could feel myself dozing. Desperate to read more, but needing to reread each sentence three or four times to take it in as my eyes glazed and my mind wandered. That’s when I heard the noise. Quiet at first, distant. A dull, scraping sound. Stone on stone. Always in pairs, a scrape-scrape noise like the beating of a stone heart. *Scrape-scrape*. *Scrape-scrape*. It was getting louder; closer. Suddenly, I didn’t feel so drowsy.



My aunt had lived in a bungalow. She’d suffered from a degenerative condition that meant her mobility only got worse and worse as she aged. She lived in a small village that was mainly small houses and bungalows with poky windows and doors tall people would need to stoop through. Buy auntie Mara's house was modern, at least compared to her neighbours. Big, double glazed windows. We didn’t even have those at home. I stared out one of those large windows at the rolling fields outside, searching for whatever golem was wandering there.



In my mind I anticipated a great stone man cresting a hill, like a scene from *The Neverending Story*. That was one my mum didn’t approve of. The scraping finally stopped and there was nothing. I breathed a sigh; of relief or disappointment I wasn’t sure. Then I saw Her.



She didn’t move into view. One moment I was staring at an empty field, the next a horrific visage. Even now, forty years on, I can see that face in excruciating detail. Swollen skin, so blue it was nearly purple, with one sagging cheek as though whatever inflated her face had burst there and the skin, stretched beyond repair, now drooped nearly to Her chin. Her eyes bulged, eager to be free of their sockets. The whites were grey and lumpy, like snow at the edge of a road. And Her teeth. Chunks of granite roughly hewn into molar, incisor, and canine. She stared into my eyes and Her jaw worked left to right, left to right. *Scrape-scrape*. *Scrape-scrape*. Bulbous lips cracked and peeled back in a mockery of a smile. 



I was frozen, unable even to scream. Warmth spread down my legs as I lost control of my bladder. A hand raised into view, but where there should have been fingers metal glinted in the moonlight. Silver mottled brown and red with rust and blood. I could smell them through the glass as She pressed Her hand against the pane. It moved over where the handle was on the inside and my chest went tight. She flicked Her wrist and the handle turned; a strong gust shoved the window open, narrowly missing my nose. 



The stench crawled in behind that wind. A thick smell, almost alive. It was the smell of rot. Of old wood and grass clippings left too long in the open. Of a sink clogged by fat and scraps of food. Of a wound left to fester, untreated. My stomach turned and I gagged but before I could be sick Her hand seized my face. Metal claws scraped against my ears and neck as She pinned my mouth closed. Bile rose up in my throat, burning its path but with nowhere to go I had to swallow it back down. 



Her other hand swept in then, scooping me up. She held me to Her like a baby. One pendulous breast cupping my head like a pillow. Where the other should have been was instead a loose flap of skin that swayed in the breeze, revealing mouldering ribs that inflated and deflated with each breath. 



I awoke in darkness, not knowing I had passed out. It was quiet and for a moment I imagined it had all been a dreadful nightmare. But the smell remained. My eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness, to the scantest moonlight that filtered into the cave I now found myself in. I had been left at the edge of a great pit. A pit from whence the horrible stench arose. I glanced in and saw a medley of organs and bones. With nothing to stop me this time, I vomited freely into the pit and began crying. 



It was kneeling there, weeping into the mass grave that my mind made an awful realisation. There was no skin. No muscle. Just bloody bones and internal organs. And none of them belonged to an adult. I screamed until my throat was raw as I knew I was going to be eaten. 



“Hush!” The voice was like sandpaper drawn over bone. The witch, for I knew then She was surely a witch, stepped between the exit of the cave and me, hunched over to fit. 



“P-p-p-" I tried to beg for my life, but even that was too great a task for me.



“P-p-p.” The witch mocked. “You’ll shut you shitting mouth, or I’ll bite your tongue out, me lad!” 



I began to weep louder, unable to control myself. She grunted with amusement.



“Crying's fine, but no more o' that yelling; hurts my ears it does. Puts me in a foul mood and you don’t want me in a foul mood when I come for ya.” She shook one of those metal claws she called fingers at me laughing. I curled into a ball, tucking my hands around my head and wept all the harder. 



When I next awoke, the pink light of dawn was visible. A low, scraping sound filled the air. This wasn’t the stone on stone of Her monstrous teeth, but a softer, longer scratching. Metal on wood, I thought at the time. There was no sign of the witch again, so I crept slowly to the entrance, listening for any noise besides the rhythmic scraping. 



There was a tree by the cave entrance. Its boughs covered in hanging skins of what I hoped were cow. She was sat beneath its branches running a claw along a strip of something. I hadn’t been there more than a moment before Her head whipped round at an unnatural angle and those fish eyes were wide with delight. She grabbed what She’d been scraping and held it up, waving it at me. It was skin, human skin. A mess of black hair still hung loosely from the scalp and the lips drooped down in an ungodly wail. I ran back to the depths of the cave. 



I sat by the edge of that pit, rocking back and forth. Wondering how long I had left to live. Wondering if my parents were looking for me. They had to be. They had to be out there, right now, searching desperately for me. They would come and...and what? My mind wondered. What could they do to this creature that already seemed long dead. No, if they came here they would die. I had to get away. 



She had revealed one thing about herself, one thing that might help me. She’d said my screaming would hurt her ears. I turned this one detail over in my head for hours, trying to build the courage for what I had in mind. Eventually, I closed my eyes, and I slid into the pit. 



You wouldn’t think the smell could be that much worse only a few feet closer. It clung to me. Not just the blood and effluent, but the smell itself. It clawed its way up my nostrils and buried deep in my sinuses, it clogged my tear ducts. I waded through the filth, finally opening my eyes to search. So many bones. So many bones. They were all so small. I picked up a rib that was loose from the sternum and pressed the end against my palm, felt it dig in. It could work. That’s what I kept telling myself: it could work. 



Rain began to fall heavily, a continuous hiss from outside. Rivulets of water slowly seeped in, turning the pit into a giant bowl of broth. I lay by its edge. There was a skull, one of many, that I focused on. It was small, smaller than the others and it looked alien. Flatter, and wider than its siblings with no teeth. An infant skull, I would come to learn. 



Squelching steps announced the witch’s return to the cave. Thin strands of black hair, the little She had, plastered to Her sodden face. She came right over and knelt beside me. She placed a claw on my leg, then another and mimed them walking up my body until She tapped my nose. A cold pain blossomed there, immediately replaced by warmth as blood began to spill. It dripped from my nose and formed a puddle by my face. I didn’t react. My mind had already gone to a quiet, distant place through a cupboard. I’d just left instructions for what my body needed to do. 



She frowned at me. Unhappy with my lack of reaction? She grabbed me roughly by the shoulder, more cuts, and threw me against the wall of the cave. 



“You think you’re brave, shitter?” She huffed. “I have sent warriors to their graves mewling for their mothers.” 



I opened my mouth as if to speak, but said nothing. She cuffed me round the ear and I felt the distinct sensation of the lobe separating from the rest.



“I would know your last pathetic words that I may deboss it on your hide after tanning!” She cackled, enjoying my apparent terror. This was it, I thought. My one and only chance. 



I took a deep breath in, as deep as I possibly could. And I screamed. I screamed louder than I had ever screamed before. I screamed until my throat went dry and my lungs emptied and then I gasped and screamed again. And as I did so, I lunged at Her. She had winced in pain at the noise and so did not immediately see my intention. The rib bone was concealed in my hand and I brought it round with all the strength left in my arms, striking at Her ear. There was resistance for just a moment before the side of Her head collapsed into itself like a rotted melon. She fell sideways and I ran. 



I looked back only once. As I reached the crest of a hill where descending would take the cave from sight. She stood there, besides the ghoulish tree. Then She screamed. It was a sound that seemed to explode from all directions, hammering me, body and soul. A terrible screech like the pained dying of some great feline. It was there and gone in an instant and then I could hear nothing. Not the rain crashing around me, nor my feet slapping against the mud. Not even my own breathing. 



The police found me collapsed in a field, covered in mud and blood. I was rushed to hospital, but none of my injuries were deemed life-threatening; the usual results of exposure to the elements, they said. The only thing they couldn’t easily explain was my ears. Perforation to both eardrums, as if from an explosion or similar loud noise. But, as people often do with things they can’t explain, they just shrugged their shoulders and forgot about it. 



I told them what had happened and obviously they didn’t believe me. Assumed it was the frightened imagining of a child. At first they said I’d left on my own, wandered out into the countryside and gotten lost. But then the found the cave. There was no pit of bones, like I’d described, but there was tracks in the mud. Mine and an adult’s. Both barefoot. That was enough to convince them I had been abducted. Just not by a witch.



I wake up sometimes thinking I’m back in that cave. Less as the years go by, but it visits me at least once a month. Then there’s the noise in my ear. Tinnitus, the doctors say. Only it’s not a ringing. It’s screeching. Her parting gift to me, no doubt. To see Her in my dreams, and forever hear Her when awake. 



I haven’t told anyone this story in so long. It feels good to get it off my chest. I truly hope this story doesn’t resonate with anyone. I do. But if it does, I want you to know you’re not alone.
