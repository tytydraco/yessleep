Everyone’s heard something weird in their house, something that doesn’t quite fit with the regular assortment of bangs, knocks and creaks that come with any building. But after some getting used to, you learn to place those noises – it’s probably just the old fridge; the pipes in the walls; the wooden floors fluctuating with the changes in humidity.



I used to hate those sounds, so when I moved into an old wooden house, you can imagine how fun the ensuing, all-new cacophony of weird sounds was. You see, I’m a light sleeper, and any noise – which usually originated from the repertoire of shit falling apart in the house – I’d wake up to. To get back to sleep, I needed to figure out where the sound came from. Otherwise it would run laps in my mind, until I’d spiral and become convinced that the knock I’d heard was a pipe that had burst and my basement was flooding, or the creak was some crazed killer who was tiptoeing their way up the stairs to my bedroom – all while I was laying in bed, unaware of it all.  



So when I woke up to a noise I didn’t recognize, I’d walk around, waiting for it to repeat, and then I’d move closer to wherever it came from until I finally found out the exact reason behind it. Then the noise was cataloged, so the next time I heard it, it wouldn’t bother me.



The noises were fine during the day, though, since I was usually working or doing something in the house that masked the noises. But god, I didn’t get much sleep in the first couple of weeks since I’d moved there.



Even after becoming acquainted with the house and its myriad of sounds, I soon found out that there were some that I couldn’t find the culprit for. Bangs, knocks, taps and creaks that felt like they were moving around the house, or coming from the walls in places I knew there wasn’t anything that could make such noises. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t place them.



After some time of listening – of giving into a sparkling obsession – I noticed that those particular sounds always came in twos. I’d wake up to a sound as if someone was outside my bedroom window: *knock knock*. But there was nothing, not the wind, not even a bird. Then the shower would start to leak: *tap tap*, yet the floor was dry in the phantom sound’s wake. 



When I realized this, it felt like I could hear them more and more. Maybe it was frequency illusion, but it felt true enough. At first I’d wake up a few times a week, scouring the house for the perpetrator of the noise. Then once a night. Then I couldn’t get an hour’s sleep without being abruptly woken up by something new. I had a history of being a bit obsessive-compulsive, so maybe that was what drew me in. Maybe it was just the paranoia that comes with sleeping in a new house. 



No matter how hard I tried, it’s not like I could just decide not to hear them. I tried relaxation exercises, meditation, you know it, but none of it worked. I just had to give in to the compulsion, because what else was I going to do? I couldn’t afford to move, and even if I did, who could say what array of sounds would come with a different house. It was better for me to try and acclimate, I assured myself.



Much like the myth about lightning striking twice, the same sound never seemed to come from the same spot again. And it wasn’t just that they bothered my sleep, because soon they started to feel like a presence, like they were intentional. I couldn’t shake the thought that there was something really weird going on, something I couldn’t quite understand.



So, one night, I decided to pull an all-nighter and simply listen. It’s not like I was sleeping much anyway. I wanted to find out what the fuck was going on with my house, or if it was just all in my head. 



I sat in the living room – the most central spot in the house – and let the noises come. It took a while to hear the first one, a double tapping on the ceiling above, but soon they began to come in waves. A scratching on the kitchen window. The thump of something heavy on the hallway rug. The bang and click of a door closing and opening. It felt like something was moving inside my house, even though I knew that couldn’t be possible. 



I was terrified, but I didn’t know what to do. My little experiment was obviously working, but I wasn’t exactly sure what the end goal was. Maybe I just wanted to affirm my hypothesis, or maybe I thought I could gain some new knowledge about the sounds. Maybe I just hoped that if I gave in, they would stop. Maybe if I let them in, I could finally sleep.



They didn’t.



The sounds that came in twos crescendoed into a drumming that shook the whole house. I felt like the house was being bombarded by something within. I couldn’t tell you how long I sat there, but it must have been hours. I could barely feel my legs, so numb they were from sitting on the cold wooden floor. At points I thought I was hallucinating, or perhaps dreaming, but there was nothing else weird going on. I had to trust that it was all truly happening, and with that came an unyielding terror that paralyzed me.



Suddenly the house quieted down, and my ears rang in the sudden absence of sound. Maybe it was over. Maybe it had gotten whatever it had wanted. I could feel my heart beating in quick succession, the flow of blood washing through my ears. I began to hear a howling wind outside, making its way through the cracks. In a moment, the house became much colder than before.



Then came two knocks on the front door.



I sat up and made my way to the door, my legs aching the whole way. My hand was already on the door knob, ready to twist, when the first pangs of hesitation hit. I knew opening the door was a bad idea, but I couldn’t help myself. I had to see this – whatever it was – to the end. After all this terror, I needed a climax. I needed to catalogue what was happening – I needed to *know*.



What greeted me on the other side were misty clouds, silvered by the half-moon lazily hanging among the stars above as a cold wind beckoned its way inside. 



The house was floating in the air.



Before I could fully process what was happening, the serene vista was shattered as I was suddenly pulled out into the cold night by an unseen force. As I fell towards my death I could feel my body changing. The fresh fear growing inside me was robbed of its expansion as visceral pain took over my body, drowning all else. I wish I could say I fought it, but when you’re being ripped apart it’s impossible to do anything but give in, to hope that it will soon be over.



My limbs began to grow into twisted and dark things. Leathery wings shot out from my back, slicing apart my shoulder blades. My teeth fell out as long and ragged rows took their place, and in between them my tongue elongated into a foul, coarse muscle. And with each new tear of the flesh, I felt myself lose control of myself. I was being forced out of myself, like a parasite being taken on by its new host.



Soon my body was transformed, and my new form imprinted on me a new set of senses. I was no longer falling, instead floating in the air, my wings holding me in place with an eerie silence. Below me I saw a row of houses, and I knew what I needed to do. 



I can’t stop myself. There are so many I’ve taken already, and in the night we fly in flocks that the sight of would terrify anyone into a crazed stupor. There’s still something of myself left, but it’s being eaten alive from the inside. Soon what I once was will be no longer, and all that will be left is the monster that I’ve become. While I’m still here, I wish to leave you with a warning. Don’t listen to the knocks, the taps, or the creaks. Don’t try to find out where they came from. 



Don’t listen.
