Hey everyone. I was going through my laptop looking for documents to complete my loan application when I came across this thing I wrote a little while ago. I think I'm finally ready to share it today. It really is incredible how much your life can change in just a few months.

November 8^(th), 2025



I don’t really know where to start with all of this, so I guess I’ll just start from the very beginning, and hope that this somehow makes sense.



My name is Jonathan and I’m 24 years old. I know isn’t that old to most people, but it sure feels like it sometimes. I was born in 2001 in an unremarkable medium sized city in the midwest. Let’s just say, this city has seen better days. What was once a major industrial employer has since been turned into a shell of what it used to be. Most of the major companies closed their factories down, and the few that remained open could never get enough workers due to a years-long population decline. The city entered a financial recession, which to this day it hasn’t fully recovered from, despite new attempts at bringing in modernized industry.



Still, a lot of the old-timers who lived to experience this city’s economic boom wanted to keep the glory days alive I guess. Them, and those who never had a chance in life. I mean, that’s my only explanation as to why those factories stayed open. Clinging on to relics of the past. One of those people was my own father. He was, let’s just say, most people’s idea of what a stereotypical blue collar worker was. One of those pickup truck driving, beer drinking types who didn’t believe in higher education, claiming that you had to get your hands dirty to be a “real man” and that college was just a scam.



Right off the bat our relationship was less than ideal. Trust me, you did not want to ever get on his bad side, or else all hell would break loose. I’m sure the death of my mother didn’t do any good for his mental state. That’s why, despite his anger problems, he got full custody of me right from the start. Looking back, I’m pretty sure he was severely depressed on top of it all. I mean how could he not be? Slaving away at the same factory your whole life, watching any opportunity you had to make something of your life slowly slipping away. Even from a young age I knew that I didn’t want that kind of life.



The problem was that I never really knew what I actually did want. As a kid I felt completely aimless. I was quiet, shy, the kind of kid everyone else pays extra attention to. This made me a prime target for bullies, who would physically and emotionally torment me every chance they got. I honestly just accepted it. I knew I wasn’t normal. I was a weird kid with no mother and a father who I was honestly afraid of most of the time.



Most days when I got home from school I’d find my father sitting on the couch in the living room in front of the TV watching either news reports or some college football game, exhausted from having worked all day. I never said much to him, and he never said much in return. I would spend the rest of the day in my cramped bedroom, either doing homework or escaping into one of my video games, the colourful images and cute characters distracting me from the torment I faced in the real world. When bed time came around I’d just lie awake staring out the small window next to my bed at the decrepit old houses out on the cracked street in front of our place, hoping that I would find any sort of direction someday.



Things continued like this for a long time. My father never gave up his tough guy attitude, and I kept on being the social outcast at school. Honestly, I don’t remember much from that period of my life. What I do remember though is the day I thought everything was going to change. It was March 21^(st), 2016, I was a freshman in high school, still fourteen at the time and it had just been another run-of-the-mill day for me. At 1pm me and a dozen other kids had settled into our science class. Our teacher told us that we’d be starting on the biology unit that day, and put on a nature documentary for us to watch.



Seriously, I still remember this moment like it was yesterday. The documentary opened on the most beautiful looking scenery I had ever seen. Deep blue skies and lush green forest for as far as you could see, broken up by majestic looking mountains in the background. The narrator of the documentary stated that we were currently looking at the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. I was entranced by the beauty I was seeing. The scene then switched to a shot of a cat moving slowly through the forest below. The narrator described the scene, a female cougar stalking a lonesome deer looking for her next meal.



The cougar moved so quietly, barely making a sound as she prepared herself for the kill, and I’ll admit I was silently cheering her on. Suddenly it jumped up, and the deer had no time to react before it was quickly taken down and suffocated by the large cat. I watched in complete awe as the cougar proceeded to drag the dead deer a short distance to a small area of densely packed trees.



What happened next is the part I remember the most about it all. The cougar let go of the deer and turned her head towards a small bush a few feet away. She meowed quietly, and out from behind the bush emerged several kittens, her babies. The mother cougar returned to the deer carcass, and her cubs ran after her, bouncing along the soft ground and over the exposed tree roots lining the forest floor. I vividly remember feeling my eyes go wide as I watched the kittens bumping into each other as they bounded towards their food, innocent as anything. It took everything in me to not scream. It was the cutest thing I’d ever seen.



I don’t really remember what happened after that, it all felt like a blur to me. I had so many emotions running through my mind, all from a simple documentary, but something changed in me that day. Seeing those kittens ignited something in me, and for the first time in my life I no longer felt aimless. To this day I’m amazed at how quickly all of this happened, but I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. After so many years of wandering aimlessly I finally had an answer. I wanted to work with animals. I wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest, far away from the industrial wasteland that I was so familiar with. I had finally found my calling, and by god I was going to do whatever I could to make my new dream a reality.



For the next few months I was on top of the world. Every night I’d spend my time researching various canine and feline species, learning as much as I could about them. I’d get lost in nature documentaries and dream about living in the locations they visited. I began researching different schools, taking a liking to one in particular purely based on its proximity to the landscape I was so in love with. I even found myself browsing used cars and trucks online. From Lincolns to beat up GMC trucks, I began imagining myself taking an epic cross country road trip to college in one of them, exploring the country and never coming back to this place. It was genuinely the best time of my life. I was still bullied at school but I didn’t care. My relationship with my father was still shaky but I didn’t care. I finally knew what it was like to dream.



I guess what they say is true, good times have to end at some point. I’d never told my father about my plan as I was terrified of what his reaction would be, but something in me finally convinced me to go through with it. I honestly don’t know what I expected to happen, but I never expected it to go the way it did. On August 2^(nd), after months of building up the courage to talk to my father, I finally told him about everything. I said that I loved science, I loved animals, and that I wanted to go to college to become a biologist. I even told him I’d take out loans to help pay for it so he wouldn’t have to get stressed over the financial side of it all.



Let me tell you, I’d seen the man blow his top before, but I was not prepared for the reaction I got this time. He grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me through the house and into the garage. I tried to protest, but he never let up on me. We entered the garage and he grabbed a short but sturdy piece of wood off his workbench. He held me against the workbench as he began hitting me in the shoulders with it. I begged him to stop but he wouldn’t listen. He shouted at me that I was a fool for getting involved in such nonsense, and that at some point I had to learn the value of “honest work” if I ever wanted to be a “real adult”.



After what felt like an eternity of tirades he threw the piece of wood at the wall and stormed back inside the house, slamming the door behind him and leaving me shaking and unable to process anything that had just happened. I remember quietly going back inside the house and shutting myself inside my bedroom, collapsing on my bed and silently crying my eyes out for at least an hour.



Well, if that man’s goal was to instill so much fear in me that I’d never dare have dreams like that ever again, then it really worked. Suddenly the thought of pursuing a degree in biology was no longer something to keep me going. It was no longer a beacon of light at the end of the dark tunnel I found myself in, metaphorically speaking. Instead it served as a reminder of what had happened that day.



Not wanting to be reminded about that day, I completely shut down again. The one dream I ever had, completely destroyed. Once again I found myself wandering aimlessly through life, sometimes wondering what I did to deserve the hand I’d been dealt. I went from pushing myself in class to doing the absolute bare minimum to pass.



On my 16^(th) birthday my father sat me down to talk to me. He said that I was now “officially an adult” and that it wasn’t his job to take care of me anymore. He told me I had until I turned 18 to “keep freeloading off of him” and then I’d be out of the house. I wish I could tell you that I was devastated by this news, that I felt my world shatter around me, but to be honest, I didn’t care. I was on complete autopilot at that point, only focused on making it to the next day.



I didn’t dare object to him this time. I immediately began setting myself up for what was coming. I got my driver’s licence later that year, and even found myself a part-time job at a fast food place at a truck stop just outside of the city. My father agreed to drive me but only until I saved up enough to buy my own car.



I’ll say it straight up, the job sucked. On my first day I was assigned to the fry station. Having to stand in front of a hot fryer for hours was unbearable, and most of my coworkers were less than friendly. It seemed like most of them were there because they never had the chance at anything more, and all their anger and bitterness seemed to come out on me most days. I remember one of my coworkers, an elderly woman named Barbara, would go ballistic on me every time I made even the slightest mistake or didn’t move fast enough.



The nicer folks were around my age, just there to pick up some extra cash. It probably helped them knowing that one day they’d be off to better things and that this was only temporary for them, and I’ll admit I found myself jealous of them because of that.



In my senior year of high school I’d finally saved enough money to buy a car. I wasn’t looking for anything particular, just something cheap and reliable to get me to work and back. I settled on a 2002 Honda CRV that I still have to this day. It had seen better days. It was covered in dents and scratches and the interior was torn up pretty bad as well, but it was cheap, and the monthly insurance payments wouldn’t break my bank account, and by that point it was all I cared about.



I don’t know how but through all of this I kept my grades above passing. My dreams of college were nothing but a distant relic at this point, but school still meant something to me I guess. I honestly don’t know why, I mean it’s not like I saw any point in any of that stuff anymore. Some voice inside of me, barely audible, just told me to keep at it. Still, on graduation day I felt no pride, no happiness. While everyone else was looking forward to whatever future they had planned, all I had to look forward to was getting the boot from my father.



The past 6 years went by a lot quicker than I thought they would. I guess once you start living day by day your perception of time gets distorted. Six years ago I packed what I could fit into the CRV and drove away from my father’s place for the last time while he stared at me from the front porch, not even bothering to say goodbye.



I had spent that summer setting myself up with an apartment in the city. It was cheap, but the saying “you get what you pay for” is definitely accurate, especially when it comes to housing. The building was located on the rougher side of town, in one of the main industrial areas. The area wasn’t exactly well off, and every morning I’d see another car in the parking lot with its windows smashed in. For once I was thankful that my car was in the condition it was. They probably didn’t see any reason to go through a car that looked like mine.



After a while I got used to the smell of the pollution and the constant blaring of police sirens. I kept working at the fast food place, but after a while I knew I wasn’t going to be able to afford to keep living off a few part-time shifts a week. Since I was denied a full-time position I had no choice but to begin looking for another job.



I wouldn’t really say that I got lucky, I mean, with everything that had led me to this point in my life luck seemed like a completely foreign concept to me. One day, as I was driving back to the apartment after a particularly busy day at work I noticed one of the factories a few blocks from the apartment was looking for full-time general labourers. By this point my bank account was already running on empty, and since it wasn’t where my father worked I bit the bullet and applied online later that evening. I was surprised at how quickly I got a job offer. The fast food place seemed eager to get rid of me, and before I knew it I was officially an employee of the factory, where I still work to this day.



On my first day one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.



Good lord, I thought working the fryer was backbreaking and mind numbing work. After something like 3 days of working at this place I had already checked out. For eight hours a day, all I did was pick up boxes from the trucks, and carry them over to where forklifts would pick them up later. Sometimes the forklifts would bring us palettes stacked with boxes, which we would then carry into the trucks.



My coworkers honestly made me nervous. I heard everything from prison stories to the most ridiculous conspiracy theories imaginable, all day every day. They constantly insulted me for my lack of physical strength or desire to be a “real man” like they were. Through it all I just kept my head down and did my best to get to the end of each shift.



Every single night I would get back to the apartment exhausted to the point of not wanting to do anything. I’d have dinner, watch some videos on YouTube, and fall asleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day for what actually felt like forever.



I was surprised that there didn’t seem to be much of a turnaround of employees at this place. I guess those guys needed that work as much as I did. Despite getting used to seeing the same folks everyday I never made any effort to try and talk to them. One day that changed however. During one of my breaks I sat down at an empty table across from an elderly man eating a sandwich.



I think it was the fact that I didn’t look or behave like the others that made him do a double take on me. He asked me why someone my age would choose to work in a place like that, instead of joining the other young folks who were hitting the highway, looking for opportunity elsewhere. I didn’t say much in return, just that I needed some quick cash. Looking back I realize I was probably doing a horrible job at pretending that nothing was wrong, but he didn’t press me anymore that day, and I was happy to be left alone.



This guy seemed like he was interested in getting to know me, so he began talking with me more often during breaks, despite my initial disinterest. His name was Ellis, and he’d been working in that factory since 1966. I’ll admit I was a little taken aback when he told me this. He seemed intelligent and well-spoken, not like a lot of the other guys who worked there. I gathered the courage to say more than 2 words to him for once and asked him how he ended up in this kind of life.



Turns out, we weren’t so different from each other, and for the first time in a long time I actually felt emotional when Ellis told me about his youth as it kind of reminded me of my own. He was 9 years old when Sputnik launched, igniting his passion for outer space. He worked hard in school to get accepted into college to study astronomy, and was apparently all set to go before his father was killed in an industrial accident. His mother completely broke down after this happened, to the point she couldn’t even take care of herself anymore.



Ellis, not wanting to just abandon his mother while she was going through all of this, officially shelved his lifelong dream, and took a job at this very factory to make ends meet and provide for his mother. For over 40 years he slaved away at the place, something I had a hard time comprehending. By the time she passed away, Ellis was in his mid 50s, his dreams a distant relic by this point, and he kept his job at the factory to keep getting by.



Hearing all of this made me more comfortable in opening up about my own experiences. I told Ellis about how I had dreamed of moving to the Pacific Northwest and going to college, and how my father wouldn’t accept it and eventually kicked me out of the house, leading me to take any kind of job I could to get by.



Despite being 53 years older than me, Ellis was honestly the closest I ever had to a friend or a father figure. I could tell he enjoyed having someone to talk to for once, and I felt the same towards him. Sure, the job never got any better, but the conversations we’d have made the days go by a little faster, and over the years we grew surprisingly close. He would always tell me that unlike him, I still had the chance to chase my dreams if I really wanted to, and that I’d absolutely regret not doing so. I appreciated that he was trying to help me, but my own fate felt sealed at this point.



It was earlier this year in March that everything began to change. The 17^(th) had started out uneventful enough, but then something struck me as odd. I’d noticed that Ellis hadn’t shown up for work. Ellis had almost never missed a single day of work in all the years I’d been there, but I wasn’t too worried at the time. Maybe he’d just gotten sick and needed a day or two to recover. As the week went on however I began to get a little worried. Where was he? It wasn’t until the 21^(st) that I overheard a conversation between a few workers as I was clocking out for the day. I couldn’t believe what I heard, and I felt the world come crashing down on me for the second time in my life.



Apparently, Ellis had been out for a drive the previous Sunday, and a drunk driver left their lane and smashed into his car head on. Both the driver and Ellis were killed on impact. I wish I could tell you I felt sad, but to be completely honest I couldn’t find it in me to feel much of anything. The only person in my life who ever cared about me was dead, and I couldn’t even be a little bit sad about it. From what I heard barely anyone showed up for his funeral.



I just kept working and getting by. Slow as molasses in January is how I’d describe the past year. I managed to get by, but the days honestly seemed to drag on forever without the old man to brighten them up just that much. Imagine spending your whole life working a dead end job in some rundown factory only to be killed by someone else's actions well into what should’ve been his retirement years. I tried not to think about my own future through all of this.



I began thinking back to what he always told me. “Chase your dreams while you still have time.” Despite his death, I still had a hard time thinking seriously about Ellis’ words. By this point I’d honestly just grown comfortable with my life. I had a routine, and while it certainly wasn’t the life I ever thought I’d have, or wanted to have, it was familiar, and it got me by, which is all I cared about anymore.



Sorry, I know that took a while to go through, I just wanted to give you some context for what led to today’s experience. I’ll also be directly quoting the conversation I had, so apologies if this next part sounds a little weird.



I can’t say anything felt unusual when I woke up, other than the pounding headache I had from the grey overcast weather. I thought I would be able to silence the headache with a nice cup of coffee, but of course my old coffee maker decided that today would be the day it would stop working. I made my usual breakfast, 2 scrambled eggs and some bacon, which I ate while staring across the dark, cramped apartment towards the balcony, barely being able to see the other buildings outside due to the fog. The old beat up CRV reminded me to get it serviced with that piercing orange light, but it still got me to work on time.



I made my way into the factory with the usual crowd, my headache only subsiding slightly as I clocked in. Despite this, I felt a little weird. I couldn’t tell why I felt this way or what caused the feeling in the first place, but something felt off, as if the air in the building was thicker. I just pushed these thoughts aside and got to work. Box after box I loaded up each truck, listening to my coworkers talking about the latest political drama and conspiracies. As always I ignored them and did what I was paid to do. Despite being just another normal morning, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I choked it up to my headache making my mind play tricks on me.



After what felt like an eternity, the sweet sound of the lunch bell echoed throughout the factory, and I sluggishly made my way to the breakroom, a chance to put down this headache with some caffeine. The breakroom looked as it always had, the dull grey ceiling lights illuminating the faded white walls and tan coloured tile floor. Of course the ancient coffee maker was out of order. I silently cursed the universe for having it out for me on this particular morning.



The breakroom was never usually too crowded as most of the workers would instead eat lunch outside and smoke. Today however, the room was a lot more crowded than it usually was, no doubt because of the weather. Though I recognized some of them, I’d never spoken to them before. I sat down in a relatively private area in the back corner of the room. By this point my headache was so bad I could barely see straight or form a coherent thought. I lay my head down in my arms on the table and closed my eyes, hoping I could relax enough to alleviate the pain.



I don’t know exactly when I dozed off, but I remember opening my eyes feeling slightly groggy. I lifted my head and looked around the breakroom, which was completely void of any signs of life. I cursed myself for falling asleep, not having had any lunch and now being late to getting back to work. I tried to check the time on my phone, but it wouldn’t turn on. I’d remembered to charge it the previous night, and choked it up to being an old model.



I left my lunch box on the table, reminding myself to pick it up at the end of my shift, and quickly left the room to get back to work before anyone noticed I was missing. As I walked down the dimly lit hall back to the factory floor however, I could tell something wasn’t right. There was no sign of life anywhere. No one was in the hall, and the surrounding rooms were completely empty. It was also unusually quiet. I couldn’t hear the familiar sounds of the machinery or the rumbling of the forklifts engines. It was at this point I noticed that my headache had completely disappeared, which I was silently grateful for. I tried not to think about the lack of activity and kept walking.



When I got back to the factory floor I was in complete shock at what I discovered. The entire factory was completely empty. The machinery had been completely shut down. The doors by the loading bay had all been closed, and forklifts were strewn about all over the place. I just stopped and stared at it all. I looked up to the windows near the ceiling of the loading bay, and outside the sky was pitch black. The possibility that I had slept uninterrupted until nightfall seemed completely crazy.



I ran back to the breakroom and grabbed my lunchbox, then hurried to the factory’s main exit. I tried the door, but it wouldn’t budge. At this point I began sweating, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. It was then that I noticed something. I guess I was in such a panic that I completely brushed over it. I looked through the small window on the door, and I couldn’t see anything. No lights, no buildings, no cars, literally nothing at all. It was like staring into a black hole. Just a completely black void.



By this point I was in a full on panic. I ran to different exits, trying each of them with no success. Hell, I even tried the doors in the loading bay. Again, they wouldn’t budge. I tried calming myself down, telling myself that I’d just fallen asleep and it was all just a bad dream. Still, something in me told me that wasn’t the case. It felt too real, too vivid to be a dream.



I began pacing back and forth, scratching at my skin and hitting myself in the head, trying anything to see if I could wake up from whatever nightmare I was in. It was then that I heard something. The faint sound of footsteps coming from one of the aisles beyond the loading bay. I froze. Honestly, I couldn’t figure out if I should’ve been relieved or afraid that I wasn’t alone in there.



I peered into the aisle where I heard the noise coming from, and I saw a person, about halfway down the aisle with their back to me. I was terrified, but I felt like I had no other choice. I slowly began making my way toward them, feeling myself shaking with each step. A few times I nearly lost my balance and fell over.



When I was maybe 20 feet from the person, I called out to them, my voice trembling so much I was surprised I was able to speak at all.



“H-hello…?” I called out. My heart felt like it was going to explode. The person turned around to look at me, and when they did I immediately felt cold sweat all over my body. I don’t remember even blinking as I just stared at them. They looked normal, but I was immediately drawn to their eyes, which were pitch black orbs as dark as the outside. They began walking towards me slowly. I couldn’t move, not only because of the immense fear I felt, but also because I knew exactly who they were.



“...E-Ellis…?” I sputtered. He stopped about 5 feet from me, and a smile formed on his face.



“Jonathan,” he said, his voice sounding all too familiar. “You made it.” I didn’t move, still trying to figure out exactly what was going on. I tried to speak again.



“W-w-what… w-what is…” I stopped. Like, I couldn’t form thoughts at that moment. My mind was literally blank.



“Don’t worry kid,” Ellis said. “You’ll be alright. Just don’t go fainting on me okay?” I’ll admit, hearing his voice again, combined with his usual warm demeanour, somehow calmed me down a little, though I was still thoroughly freaked out over the whole situation. “Come on, let’s sit down. There’s something I want to tell you.”



I hesitantly followed him back to the breakroom, resisting every urge and thought screaming at me to make a run for it. I sat down next to my lunchbox, and Ellis sat down across from me. I couldn’t make eye contact. I mean, how do you make eye contact with someone, or something, that has no eyes? I was still shaking and stuttering like a maniac, but somehow my thoughts came back to me, and I was able to form coherent sentences again.



“W-what the hell is going on?” I stammered through heavy breathing. “What… is this place? Why… w-why am I h-here?” Ellis reached over to me and put his hand on my shoulder. I flinched hard, but something, I don’t know what, finally gave me the courage to look at his face again. I cringed seeing his eyes again, but I also saw that same warm smile, that same smile that told me he cared when no one else did. He patted me on the shoulder a few times, and somehow I began to calm down.



Ellis sat back down in his chair, and I took a moment to breathe. I gathered my thoughts, and spoke.



“What the hell is this place?” I asked hesitantly. “Why are you here? Why am I here?”



“Jonathan,” Ellis replied to me with a slight hint of concern in his voice. “There’s something I need to tell you, and you have to listen to me, alright? Don’t ignore me this time, okay?” As he said this I felt a tinge of guilt creep into my mind, and I had a pretty good idea of what he was going to start talking about. I took a few more breaths, then replied.



“A-alright,” I said.



“So you may have heard about my untimely demise,” said Ellis

“Y-yeah I d-did,” I replied. “Y-you were k-killed by a drunk driver, r-right?”



“Damn truck hit me head on,” Ellis said back, his tone of concern being replaced with mild anger. “Crazy fool must’ve been going around 90 or 100 miles per hour. Had literally no time to react.”



“J-jesus,” I said, not wanting to even imagine the situation at this point. Ellis continued.



“I only remember a split second of the impact. Next thing I knew, I woke up here. I tried to escape, but just as you did I found every exit sealed shut. Tried near everything to get out of this place.”



“So…” I said, looking around the confines of the breakroom, “you’ve been trapped in here ever since?” Ellis looked around, and sighed.



“Yep,” he replied, sounding defeated. “Sure is lonely here. Wandering the same aisles and rooms aimlessly, over and over again, with not a single soul to talk to.” He looked me in the eyes, at least I think, and continued to talk. “I think I know what happened, and you have to listen to what I’m about to tell you.” At this point I was immensely curious as to what. I did my best to make eye contact.



“So… what’s going on?” I asked nervously, my voice still trembling slightly. I wasn’t actually sure if I wanted to know, but by now my curiosity was pulling at me for answers, so I went through with it, but what he said next are words that will stick with me until the day I die.



“Kid,” Ellis said as he looked around the breakroom once more, then back to me, his voice laced with sadness. “I think… I think this is my afterlife.” I couldn’t say anything, I was so confused about it all. I tried to talk but my throat felt frozen in place.



“The universe works in mysterious ways doesn’t it?” Ellis asked rhetorically. “Seems like since I dedicated my whole life to this place it decided that I’d stay here forever. Thought I’d finally find peace when I died, but it seems that the universe has a sick sense of humor.”



I stared at Ellis as he stood up from his seat. He walked around to my side of the table, and sat down right next to me. I looked him directly in the eye, as much as I could.



“Jonathan,” he began, “I need to ask you something important.” I listened intently as he continued. “You’ve got one life in front of you. Is this really how you want to spend it?”



I looked at the floor, and a strange feeling washed over me. I felt sad. It had been so long since I last allowed myself to feel such emotion that it felt almost alien to me. Every event, every conversation that led me to this point in my life came rushing back to me all at once. The isolation I experienced as a kid. The day my world changed and I had a dream for the first time in my life. The day my father literally beat my dream out of me, which also started my downward spiral, eventually landing me right here in this breakroom in whatever this godforsaken place even was.



After suppressing these feelings for so long and believing it was too late for myself to reignite my childhood passion it felt weird to have them come back like this. I felt something in my eyes. Tears. I guess Ellis noticed too.



“You’re 24 Jon,” he said. “Is this truly what you want to make of your life?” I tried to hide my crying, but the feelings of regret were just too strong. I put my hands over my face, and for the second time in my life, began bawling my eyes out like there was no tomorrow. It truly wasn’t what I wanted at all, and I couldn’t pretend like it didn’t bother me anymore.



Suddenly Ellis grabbed me, and I instinctively put my arms around him as he wrapped me in the biggest hug I’d ever felt. I was wailing.



“This isn’t what I wanted at all,” I sobbed as I held an iron grip on Ellis. “But I feel like it’s too late already.”



“Jon, Jon,” Ellis replied.



“I’m sorry,” I said, still crying.



“Hey, hey, it’s okay, it’s okay,” he reassured as he continued to hug me.

I don’t know how long I cried for, honestly to me it felt like an hour. As I began to calm down, I gently pushed myself off of Ellis, who let me go. I sat back down in my chair and looked at the floor once again.



“Jonathan, listen to me,” Ellis said. I looked up at him as I wiped the tears from my eyes. “You’re 24 years old, you still have your entire life in front of you. It’s too late for me, because, well, I’m already dead. But it’s not too late for you. You have so many years ahead of you. ”



“I-I guess,” I said, still sniffling. “It’s just been so long. I don’t know if I could do it at this point. It’s been so long.” Ellis sighed, then looked around the breakroom before turning to look at me.



“Felt damn good to talk to you again,” he said warmly, “but I’m afraid I’ve got to send you back to the real world before it’s too late.” I looked at Ellis, not saying anything as he continued. “Whatever you choose to take away from our conversation today is none of my business, but I’m gonna ask you one more time. Do you really want to spend your only shot, your one chance, endlessly slaving away at this place?” I just sat there taking everything, trying to think of anything to say. After an admittedly awkward silence I spoke.



“I-I’ll think about it I guess.” Ellis smiled as he patted me on the shoulder.



Next thing I knew, I was jolted awake by the sound of the familiar wail of the buzzer as it echoed throughout the factory. Five minutes to get back to the loading bay. Whatever that was felt like it lasted a lot longer than 30 minutes. I looked around the breakroom. The few people who were in here with me put their lunch boxes away and left the room, one of them impatiently telling me to stop slacking and get back to work before they disappeared. I just sat there, trying to comprehend what had just happened. I got through the rest of the day somehow, with the whole experience basically playing on repeat in my mind the whole time.



When I got back to the apartment about an hour ago my mind was reeling. I wanted to believe that whatever I’d experienced had just been a really vivid dream, yet something deep inside me was telling me that it wasn’t that simple. The whole experience felt so real, and I’d felt completely awake the whole time.



After spending a few minutes watching the evening sun set over the city and taking a few moments to collect my thoughts I lay down in my bed with my laptop, which is where I am right now. Seriously, that university still looks as beautiful as when I first discovered it way back then. Somehow my grades from high school remained good enough that they met the requirements for applying to their biology program, don’t ask me how. I’m hoping the job will pay well enough in the next 8 months that I won’t have to apply for loans, but honestly that’s not even a big concern of mine at this point.



I think I’ll wrap this up now, and see about getting to work on my application. I still have a few weeks before the deadline, so if I start now I should be finished well before then. Again, I’m sorry if this whole thing has come off as a mess and a bit weird, but I just have so many questions. Had I had the most vivid dream of my life? Or did Ellis by some freak occurrence in the universe actually bring me into his afterlife?



I guess I’ll never know for sure, I doubt anyone would even believe me if I told them about it. But if by any chance, no matter how slim, I actually did witness Ellis’ afterlife, then let me tell you, I don’t know what I’d do if I ended up like that. Eternally walking the halls of a place I never wanted to be in the first place, all the time in the world to think about what could’ve been.



I’ll end this here. I’m nervous, like really nervous right now. I don’t know if this will work. My application could be rejected. I could go into a ton of debt from how much this will cost me that’ll take me years to repay. Hell, maybe this won’t even lead to anything, after all I’ve heard that biology is a competitive field right now, but I feel like I have to at least give it a shot. I have to at least try. Try to get back the life I thought I’d lost so long ago now. I have to try while I still have time. I have to try before it’s too late. I have to try before I end up walking that empty factory floor for eternity, just like Ellis.
