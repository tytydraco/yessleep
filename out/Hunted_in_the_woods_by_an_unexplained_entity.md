I have a lot of pretty scary stories but I have one that I feel the need to share.


I used to be a heavy alcoholic it was consuming my life and it caused me to lose a lot of things around me. A close friend of mine deciding help gifted me a  companion a beautiful German Shepherd. My friend offered to help me train the dog in obedience and personal protection ,but it was only at his home. 

Now to give this context my friend lived in the middle of absolute nowhere once its dark you can’t even see your hand in front of you he was very well prepared but anything about 15 miles out it’s complete desolate mountains covered in dense  forest (you get lost your screwed). We had a deal that once a week  I would drive out to go do this training since he lived a considerable distance from me I always packed for the worst. 

So on this particular day my friend offered for me to spend the night at his house. He knew I needed someone to talk to as I was going through a very depressing time in my life. I ended up declining I was tired and wanted to just get home and mope quietly. This happened in October so it gets cold but not as cold as the later months and on that day the forecast read 86 degrees. 


I get into my truck and my dog whined he wanted to sit in the front with me I cheekily agreed since I knew I had to drive slow anyways. I had to drive very slow since it’s going down a very steep mountain only one road to get up to his place. I moved all my stuff to the back seat of my truck and my dog jumped in the front seat.


As Im driving down mountain it was suddenly getting very dark and very foggy. My friend texted but I did not want to read it since I was driving and very nervous due to the visibility being low. It suddenly started raining and then the worst happened. My truck began to slide off the mountain I slammed on my breaks but it was too late. I grabbed my dog held him next to me and then I heard a crash and blacked out. 

I woke up to the sound my dog whining and barking licking my face trying to wake me up. I opened my eyes and grabbed my dog hugging and making sure he was okay. I didn’t care about the truck he was a priority luckily he was okay just shook  up understandably. 


Since my head lights were busted and I listing to music so I couldn’t find my phone. Luckily my radio light was shining just bright enough for me to see my phone and when I shined the light my heart dropped. I flew off the mountain and the only thing that stopped me from falling off a damn cliff was three trees that were just growing on the side of cliff. We would have been killed I shined my flash light in the back all of my supplies were crushed up against a tree no way to get it. I knew I couldn’t stay there so I grabbed my dog and began my trek to atleast get to solid ground. 


Climbing up tree by tree carrying a 6 month old German shepherd that didn’t understand the concept of standing still was not a fun at all. Once i reached stable ground I sat for a break. I looked at the stars I was already in a horrible spot mentally all I wanted was to lay at him and drink my self blind and pass out. Instead I was stuck in the middle of forest with no signal a dog and no motivation. I spent some time in the military with some combat deployments so I had been in situations near death before. Only this time I wasn’t in the mindset of pushing my self to safety. 


I looked down and saw two beautiful honey colored eyes and I thought how can anyone just give up on anything this beautiful. So I got up slapped my self and said you can do this idk how but I will get out of this. My adrenaline wore off at this point then suddenly my pain hit my head was throbbing and my ribs hurt. I started coughing up blood then suddenly I felt cold and when I looked up snow. I panicked again my sudden motivation began to turn into a sudden reality shock. I was snowing and I inured I needed medical attention so I began limping up the closest mountain I saw. 



I couldn’t see a damn thing just I had a iPhone light and a dog leading the way. My dog wasn’t fully trained anytime we would off leash hike he would just run off without giving it a second thought. Something odd was happening he did not leave my side it was like he knew how dire our situation was. I started having minor black outs from my head ache and I felt the cold blood running on the side of face but I knew I had to keep moving. Just one foot in front of the other following my dog it was about 10pm at night I told my self atleast make it through the morning. 

“Maybe it will be warm “ 

“Someone will find me” 

“I don’t want anyone to find me “

“Just end it here” 

I was losing hope by the hour losing my mind when all of sudden the sound of pure nothing. I suddenly stopped I can hear my heart beat I thought it was gonna burst through my chest. They say when you’re out in the woods and if everything goes quiet there’s a predator near by. I tried not to let this get to my head as I was freaked out and I had a sense of courage since I was carrying a fire arm.

Suddenly out of nowhere I heard the most bone chilling voices that will haunt me until my last breath. I heard voices from people from my past some from the cause of my trauma that put me in that mindset.

“Hey son look at you aww come here I know you need a hug don’t worry Il come make your favorite meal “ it was my grandmothers voice 

“Come on what’s wrong please come talk to me I missed you so much I want to get back with you” a past lover


I heard these voices clear as day the soothing thoughts the words i so desperately wanted to hear tears flowed down my face.  I faced the direction of the voiced they sounded more distant calling my name. My I felt desperate to reach them.


“Please don’t leave me” I said 

Suddenly I felt sharp teeth clamp on my pants the pain shot me out of a trance. It was my dog a 6 month of old ball of joy just bit me and herded me away from the voices. I couldn’t hear it but I can feel it. It was like my dog was saying 
“Dad this way come on don’t go over there come with me”.

All night I was blacking out I must have walked for miles and it was the same thing back and forth the voiced my past coming back to haunt me. Each time getting more angrier what turned into something i so longed to hear quickly became a nightmare. 

I didn’t even care at one i said 

“Come get me bring it on” 
It got eerily quiet then my fight or flight kicked in and there goes my dog the same thing pushing me along.  I Completely blacked out then suddenly with a stroke of luck I got a phone signal. In a near drunken state I managed to call my friend who luckily happened to be awake. I was in a completely haze after the phone call I can’t remember anything nothing to this exact day. All in remember was the voices my dog and very slowly creeping up to a main road and black.


I woke up inside my friends house I was warm with hot tea freshly made next me.


“Damn bro you are one lucky mother fucker go out and buy your dogs treats and hug him tight tonight” 


Apparently I auto piloted my self and laid down it had snowed so much that I was completely covered. My friend was driving around in his atv searching for me when suddenly he found my dog 

“Where’s your dad “  he asked

My dog goes and leads him to me digs me out of the snow and he was able to bring me back to safety. When he told me that I was in complete shock I can’t remember it a blur 
I went to the hospital I had a 3 broken ribs a broken nose and showing signs of hyperthermia and dehydration a long with a minor concussion. My dog got out thankfully very lucky he didn’t have a scratch. After I healed up enough to go back to my friends to go see about getting my truck my friend searched it. It was 30 minute drive from where he lived and that’s driving on a normal road I had walked from 8:30pm until 4am.

My friend has a trail camera of me falling to the ground where he found me and in the video my German shepherd goes ballistic at something behind me. I told my buddy what happened that night to me he freaked out. Apparently the area was an Indian reservation before there’s even reports of battles. My friend said there’s always weird stuff going on cause it was apparently cursed. I don’t know what I believe but I know what happened that night.


This happened 4 years ago I rarely talk about it I since moved on from it but when in do Its very difficult. I have plenty more stories but that’s one to share to you guys for my first time.
