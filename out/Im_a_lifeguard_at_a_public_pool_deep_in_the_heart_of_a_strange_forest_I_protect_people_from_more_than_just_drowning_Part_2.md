[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mfpeud/im_a_lifeguard_at_a_public_pool_deep_in_the_heart/)

Hey, it’s Lifeguard Luke. Just wanted to give a quick thanks to all that showed up the past couple weeks to give Mirror Forest Pool a try. I would like to give a quick apology to that European gentleman who got his leg stuck in the pool jet. I’m still not sure how he got it in there (he kept yelling that the little hole opened like a mouth and chomped on him) but rest assured we will take all the necessary precautions so it doesn’t happen again. I hope covering the cost of your prosthesis made us square.

So back to the usual programming: we have a new rule.

We penned it up last Thursday. Rick and I were on the opening shift. We had gotten to the pool a little earlier than usual. Summer was coming to an end, and that meant we were in the busiest part of our season. It seems like right when the first cold winds of autumn blow, everyone tries to fit one more trip to the pool into their schedule. The past couple of days, we had been packed with patrons. We didn’t expect anything different today, so we were trying to get a head start on the rush.

While we were setting up the pool and double checking that the shallow and deep ends hadn’t switched when our backs were turned, Rick noticed something. It made us both stop dead in our tracks.

There was a beach ball floating in the far corner of the middle section.

Now, at any other pool this would not be a cause for concern. Pools and beach balls go together like Adam Sandler and Kevin James. However, there was just one problem:

We don’t own any beach balls.

We had learned to be cautious of any objects with an unknown origin floating in the pool due to the towel mishap. Carter, one of the old hats, had tried to pull out a soggy towel from the shallow end at closing time, thinking it was left behind by a patron. In three seconds flat it had sucked all the flesh and bone from underneath his skin, leaving his hand a floppy glove dangling on his wrist. I was the one that rode with Carter in the ambulance. He screamed bloody murder all the way to the hospital, even though the EMS people were doping him up full of morphine.

Before I helped Carter into the vehicle, I thought I saw the towel scoot off the property like an inch worm. It was hard to tell with all the commotion. We were never able to find it.

If you ask me, I think the towel is living happily in the forest now. Sometimes I’ll come across a hollowed out squirrel or racoon laying flat and empty like some novelty rug by the front door. It reminds me of how cats leave mice and moles on your front porch just to be friendly. I do hope it means the towel has no hard feelings.

Well, once me and Rick saw that beach ball, we didn’t like it one bit. We told our boss about it, hoping he’d have a solution. He just said to leave it, and don’t let anyone in the pool until it goes away. Turning people away at the door was a bit awkward, but most were understanding. We told them it was chem problems, and to give it a few hours. Every so often, we’d check to see if the beach ball was still there. Each time, we’d see it floating innocently around the middle section like some docile shark grinning at his next meal.

We didn’t have any undue problems for most of the morning. Then the birthday party showed up.

Not to sound like a walking advertisement, but Mirror Forest Pool is rentable for private gatherings. We have a pretty cheap rate too. That means we host a lot of birthday parties, usually for young kids. Most times, it’s fun to work those shifts. Less people to lifeguard, and sometimes they give you a slice of cake for your troubles.

That wasn’t the case today. With the beach ball in the water, we were looking at a serious hit to pool income.

Plus, these kids were the absolute worst.

I have never seen a birthday party with more animosity. It was fifteen kids, and all of them were out for blood. Even in the lobby they were grappling each other, exchanging wet willies and five stars like butterscotch at a nursing home. It was all being encouraged by their leader who, for anonymity’s sake, I will refer to as Birthday Boy.

Birthday Boy was basically young Hitler. He had the angry face, weird hair, and the energy of a new meth addict. All he was missing was the mustache. I don’t know how he managed to have such a hold on all his friends, but it was like watching a new third reich forming before my very eyes. If Birthday Boy told his friends to string me up on a cross and pull my entrails out with their bare hands, I truly believe they would’ve done it.

His poor parents were dead on their feet. They really only moved or spoke to fulfill Birthday Boy’s demands. They were initially very understanding when we told them about the “chem problems.” They even considered the full refund we offered so they could have the party somewhere else. But when the kids started chanting “we want pool” over and over again in progressively louder screams, they caved almost immediately.

Me and Rick went to ask the boss what to do. He suggested a compromise: let them onto the pool deck to do all the party stuff. Maybe the “chem problems” would go away at some point in the next couple of hours and they could swim. But under absolutely NO circumstances were we to let them in the water before the beach ball went away.

We told the party they could use the pool deck until the chems balanced, and it seemed to cure their infantile bloodlust. The kids filed through the locker rooms and onto the deck. Birthday Boy  punched Rick in the junk when he walked past. No love lost there.

They got set up and did all the traditional party things: cake, presents, the works. As the boxes of pizza emptied and the stack of presents got smaller, I kept praying that the beach ball would blow away, or I would just blink and it would be gone. I wasn’t sure how we were going to keep the little dictator out of the pool once there was no food or gifts to occupy him.

Eventually, the last gift was unwrapped, and despite my pleadings to whatever deity watches over the fate of minimum wage workers such as myself, the beach ball remained.

And the chanting started again.

We made a big show of checking the chem levels. Rick even managed to get the test to show a straight 14 on the scale (no idea how he did that). I told the kids they would melt if they got in the water now (I saw Rick shudder when I said that. He was still not over the whole 4th of July incident).

Of course, Birthday Boy didn’t care. He redoubled the chanting efforts, and started sending out sorties to get past our defensive line and into the water. We managed to hold it for a little while, using our red lifeguard tubes to extend our reach, all the while yelling about how dangerous it was for them to get in now.

But then the inevitable happened.

Two young men cannot hold back an army, and it was only a matter of time before one of the little devils attempts was successful. Birthday Boy was the one who found the weakness. He dodged under my arm and did a cannonball into the center section. My heart stopped. For a moment, everyone, including the kids, stared at the bubbles coming to the surface, waiting to see what would happen.

Birthday Boy emerged from the water perfectly fine, a triumphant and evil grin on his face.

Seeing as their leader was not melted, the kids bum-rushed us. All of them were in the water in thirty seconds flat. Rick, me, and the parents begged them to get out, but they had us outnumbered three to one.

That’s when I made a mistake.

Trying to mitigate the damage, I yelled “don’t touch that beach ball!” Hitler kid was the only one that heard me. He turned his head and noticed the floating toy. He gave me the worst shit-eating grin, and doggy paddled his way over to the ball. The whole thing played out in slomo as I tried to get to the other end of the pool before he did. He made slow progress, but I was slower. I watched him get ten feet, five feet, two feet from the ball. Before I could close the distance, he reached out and grabbed it.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Birthday Boy grinned his stupid-ass grin again, then bounced the ball toward his friends. They noticed the plaything too, and began bouncing it between them as well. I was so fixed on the ball, I almost missed what was happening to B. Boy.

Almost.

I turned, and saw he had a worried expression on his face. He was holding his abdomen and grimacing. He started looking at his hands. Birthday Boy was a bit on the larger side, but I could see something was happening with his fingers. 

They were getting fatter, going from hotdog sized to full on bratwursts.

He started to emerge from the water. I thought he was just treading extra hard, but soon his entire upper body was above the surface. I figured out what was happening.

He was inflating. Like a beach ball.

It would have been comical if it hadn’t been horrifying. What was once a grimace had turned into screams of pain. His voice increased in octave. His skin stretched, and I saw blood vessels bursting under the strain. Bruises appeared all over his distended body. His skin became translucent, and I could see muscles ripping and tearing to accommodate whatever gas was filling his cells, his organs losing their place and tumbling around inside of him. I could see the fragile bits of skin that held together the interior tear and rip as everything jumbled up together in  giant ball of innard spaghetti.

Birthday Boy rose up entirely out of the water, and began to float in the air.

I turned to see if anyone else was watching and could help me, but no one was paying attention.

They were too busy watching the other kids inflate.

Every child who’d touched the beach ball was in the process of inflating. Within minutes, half the kids were up in the air being blown about by the wind. All of them were screaming in pain, crying out for their mom and dad’s to save them. Even Hitler kid was asking for his poor parents to get him down.

Birthday Boy’s parents must have really loved their son, because that’s when they got a bit crazy. They began ripping the place apart to find anything they could use to get him down. The mom got her hands on the pool scooper (the thing you use to get poop out of the pool, which I found poetic)  and began swinging it at Birthday Boy.

She swung once, missed. Swung twice, strike two. She finally connected on the third swing.

And Birthday Boy exploded.

I guess there was a sharp edge on that pool scooper, because one second Birthday boy was ten feet off the ground, the next his insides were all over the pool deck. His lungs floated on top of the water, his intestines were draped over the slide like streamers. His floppy skin got flung over one of the deck chairs, leaking a steady stream of blood into the drain, and staining the water red. The mom was covered in her son’s viscera, head to toe. She started screaming and collapsed onto the ground.

That was when Rick called EMS.

It took forever to get all the kids down. They found two trapped up in the trees, and one had hit a breeze so hard they were a full county over. The first aid people made sure to deflate them nice and slow. I think Birthday Boy was the only one that exploded. Officially, at least. There are still three more missing.

The beach ball disappeared while we were dealing with all that. I have no idea where it went. It could have just dematerialized I suppose, but I have an inkling that it’s wandering the forest with the sentient towel. God help us if they find each other. They could take over the world with an army of ballooned forest creatures.

Before the end of the day, the boss printed up a new rule for the binder: 

Rule 587: “No outside toys or inflatables allowed. Stay away if observed.”

It was kind of quiet once emergency services left. We cleaned up the blood, and made sure there weren’t any pieces of leftover bowel in the pool. We closed early for the day at the boss’s orders. As I was leaving though, I noticed something weird.

The Thursday Diver was waiting at the front desk.

It took me a moment to remember what day of the week it was. I checked the time. It was almost four o’clock. Mr. Thursday must’ve been waiting at the front desk for hours.

I tried to ignore him. We weren’t supposed to interact with him outside of taking admission (which we couldn’t do today) but I could feel him staring at me.

I managed to get out the door without glancing back.

As I started up my car, I saw Mr. Thursday leave the facility. He disappeared into the forest. I don’t think he took any established forest path. He just marched right through the brush and  straight into the woods. Then he was gone.

I had never seen that before. I had never wondered where he came from, but thinking about it now made me nervous.

Hopefully the next few weeks will be quiet, this whole debacle was a lot to deal with. To everyone out there who’s a little freaked out, don’t let this one story stop you from visiting. Again, Mirror Forest Pool is a great place. Come here and you’ll see. It’s summer in a bottle, all year round. At least, that’s what it says on the brochure.

If you do come, just make sure to leave the toys at home. For your own [safety.](https://www.reddit.com/r/agoraphobic_archives/)
