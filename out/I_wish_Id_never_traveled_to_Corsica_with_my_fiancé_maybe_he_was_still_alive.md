I remember exactly how excited I was that day. It had been about seven months of planning, contacting the travel company just to make sure nothing was off track.

José told me at least twenty times a week that I shouldn’t forget to take my medications. I discovered at eleven years old that my anxiety could affect various areas of my life, making sure everything was going well was the least of my problems.

I ended up waking up much earlier than my fiancé. He was still twisted in bed, taking up almost all the space for himself. We would leave at six-fifteen in the morning. It was our first international trip... From Brazil to Corsica, it had always been my dream! It would be twenty-two hours to Figari. I was pure ecstasy.

With all the suitcases ready, including my fiancé's, we embarked on an incredible journey. Figari, the administrative area of Corsica, right on the corner of France, was perfect. There was the most beautiful and blue lake I had ever seen in my life. In the shallow part, you could still see the stones covered by green moss because it was so transparent, but as the depth increased, it became impossible to see beyond the navy blue barrier. Indescribable.

We toured the entire island, from end to end. We went through all the convenience stores, bought keychains and mugs, shirts, and other knickknacks. I felt totally like one of those tourists in the movies, oh, how I wish the whole experience had been as full of happiness as it was at the beginning.

While walking, we found one of the local shops that I considered the most beautiful on the island. With a rustic structure, built on almost red-toned stones, I was delighted to see that it was surrounded by kittens outside and one inside, watching from the window next to an elderly woman with white hair and eyes almost as blue as the lake that served as a rest for the eyes.

We entered the store at my insistence, after petting the tabby cat and greeting the elderly woman who seemed so kind, we started to explore every corner of the shop.

As we passed by a collection of island tourist shirts, the elderly woman, the shopkeeper, or perhaps the owner since she was the only one there besides us, was watching us with an extremely friendly smile, as if she was holding back from making friends. I waved to her, and she waved back and returned to her magazine behind the counter.

“This one seems perfect for your sister.” My fiancé held up the shirt to show me. It was white, with a whimsical map of the island's best tourist spots, very colorful and fun.

“Oh, yes. She would definitely love to walk around with a map on her belly.” We laughed together as he put the shirt back. I scanned the entire establishment. It seemed to be a few decades old… The dust accumulated in the corners might be due to the island's sand, the grains surrounded the whole town.

Various masks were hanging on the walls, they probably sold well during the fantasy festival. It was a cultural event that would take place in about two weeks. I really wanted to participate, but since the demand at that time was very high, we decided to come two weeks earlier because we knew there would be little movement, so the ticket prices would be lower.

The masks seemed extremely real, so real that at some point they started to cause me a lot of discomfort. I felt my back shiver when I laid eyes on what seemed to be a child’s face. The expressions, the skin so real made me extremely uncomfortable.

I lowered my eyes, as if it was almost a sign of disrespect, you know? To keep looking at something that seemed so human and scary.

In the corner of a clothing rack, there was a slightly open wooden door. I imagined it was some kind of bathroom, judging by the tiles on the wall. I thought about asking to use it, but I couldn’t find the elderly woman when I looked around. As I got closer, maybe due to a mistake on my part, I thought I saw a child’s figure near the door.

The problem is that the figure seemed to be lying on the floor. Motionless.

Before I could think of anything, the elderly woman mysteriously emerged from a corridor and closed the door. Her friendly look seemed to tremble and turn into something entirely different.

It was a look of anger, something had ignited this feeling inside her and, apparently, I was not welcome there.

“How can I help you, dear?” The scratched and weak voice came from her throat, using an almost indecipherable English, because of her heavy accent.

“Uh, I… was wondering if I could maybe use your bathroom, if it’s not too much trouble.”

“No bathrooms here, dear.” She said, pulling me to another side of the shop. “You make a lovely couple, don’t you? Come, dear ones, I have a space reserved for photographs, what do you think? We can make a fridge magnet for you.” Suddenly, her English seemed to adjust and become much more understandable. Just like her look had changed.

In some way, perhaps by instinct, something in her and the shop started to want to keep me away from all of it. I grabbed José’s hand as soon as I reached him and opened my mouth to refuse, but he interrupted me.

“My mother would love to receive one of these, love. Let’s! Please, it’s a great way to remember this moment.”

I smiled, unable to refuse. I should have listened to my instincts. I should have held his hand tighter and pulled him out of that hellish place. But I wanted to trust, I imagined that maybe it was just my anxiety speaking louder and wanting to stop me from enjoying another great moment in my life.

“Come, dear ones. Follow me.” We, unfortunately, followed the short woman with wavy white hair. The corridor was very dark, sometimes I stumbled over what seemed like a hard cushion. Probably merchandise scattered on the floor.

“Well, let’s start with you, dear. And then, we’ll take his and finally both of you together.” She said when we reached a very bright room. Some poufs in front of a camera. Things were starting to get creepy. I covered my nose as soon as I noticed the putrid smell of the place.

“I actually think we should go back. We don’t have money for three photo sessions, you know?” As I thought about taking a step back, bringing my fiancé with me, she grabbed my hand and helped me sit on the pouf.

“It’s on the house, dear.” She smiled in a way that made me weak. “Can I offer you some coffee, no? How rude of me.” She turned to a coffee pot in the corner of the room.

Honestly, with that smell of rotten meat, I didn’t feel like drinking anything from there. I looked at José widening my eyes, almost begging for help to leave. Unfortunately, he was so entertained with the other pictures that he didn’t even pay attention to me. “Wow… Have you ever worked as a photographer?” He asked while looking at the photos.

“Actually, I started recently. Two or three years ago.” She said while sweetening the cups. I noticed she really went heavy on the sugar, which was unusual. Maybe she knew that Brazilians naturally loved sweets. Since, generally, the French didn’t have the habit of making everything so sweet. “I know it seems strange, after all, I’m not as young as you, but it doesn’t seem like a good idea to die without trying everything first, right, dear ones?” She said while handing the coffee to us.

I was genuinely irritated by the situation. I couldn’t deny being there and the place reeked of rotten people, besides being extremely creepy. It looked like a butcher’s room.

“Here, dear. Before it gets cold.” The smile she gave me was so supernatural that I had to force myself to overlook it. The coffee was so strong that my head immediately started to hurt.

“Don’t you have, by any chance, an… aspirin? I think my migraine is acting up.”

“Sorry, dear. I don’t.”

The last thing I remember before passing out was the sound José’s body made as it hit the cold floor. He was a big man, I was startled when I heard it, but I couldn’t react. Right after seeing my fiancé fall to the ground, my vision blurred, and the pain was so unbearable that suddenly everything was dark.

. . .

Before even opening my eyes, I felt I was completely immobile. Unable to move a single muscle, not even my mouth, which was stitched shut.

I was lying in my own blood if it was indeed mine. The smell was unbearable. Panic started to take over me, tears blurred my vision for a moment, and I tried desperately to scream. I looked for José and found no sign of him, not in the dark.

“Oh, dear. You woke up?” She turned on the light. “Don’t worry, I won’t take long with him. It’ll be over soon.” It took me a moment to understand what she was saying.

Until she threw José’s body beside me and climbed on top of him.

The following scenes were so torturous that it wouldn’t have hurt as much if those cuts had been made on me. She raised a surgical scalpel and outlined his entire face. I thrashed around with all my strength, hurting myself in some parts, feeling my limbs exhausted.

First, she slowly removed the skin. Then, she took a cleaver from her side.

The entire white floor was drenched in blood. I was lying in my fiancé’s blood. His blood stained my hair, invaded my nostrils. At that moment, I wanted to die. I tried to make that wretched old woman hear my pleas, to kill me too, to stop me from witnessing the life being snuffed out and the suffering, the torture of the man with whom I had planned a wedding and a life a year from now.

I closed my eyes when she lowered the cleaver onto José's chest.

The old woman simply stood up and turned off the light again. She left me trapped in the dark, knowing I was lying next to my fiancé. Dead and faceless.

“Be prepared, dear. If the demand for female masks increases at this festival, I have merchandise in stock.”
