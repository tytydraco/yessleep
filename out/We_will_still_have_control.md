Will we still have it? You can ask Ai

Why are there failed experiments? It's very obvious. If we are talking about a subject of an experiment or a person, we must assume that the subject of the experiment itself is inherently subjective. Failed experiments, as well as those that succeed, show us that our expectations do not always lead to successful attempts. However, there are also experiments or, rather, experiences that resonate with our impressions, opinions, expectations, and desired outcomes. All experiments, however, have at least one observer. It has been scientifically proven that atomic particles have a "double standard" in the presence of an observer. Do not misunderstand, thoughâ€”without successful experiments, we would not evolve as a species. It is unfortunate that society, people, are subjects of experiments, don't you think?

Everyone has an opinion, for example, about vaping. It has recently been proven to be much more "nice." Since they appeared on the market, it was clear in my mind: it's something new, the negative effects over, say, a 10-year prospective period are unknown, but they were legalized anyway. So, it's a kind of experimentâ€”we'll live and find out. The guilty will be found. Probably, if technology or knowledge about "immortality" existed on earth in the hands of humans, the masses would most likely find out much later, not to mention the access to it. Guaranteed, we will not grasp it even in a second life, and so on; the rich continue to get richer and most likely will also live much better or much longer.

We see competition everywhere, from sports to human relationships and so on. The downside is that even animals are in competition when it comes to survival. In some fable, I found that extraterrestrials have completely eliminated competition within their civilizations. The question was, why? Given the fact that the state also has its subjectivity, besides the "diplomatic" surface aspect, the current state of war is also an experiment. Unfortunately, war is waged by people with their lives, not by animals. It's a pity, but anyone who rationalizes correctly realizes that all the products in the store are themselves experiments. When even the term "organic food" is falsely advertised, also for money. The problem, in fact, is that there are other observers, perhaps even more curious. Humanity fails year by year, although society evolves.

In my opinion, when man stops observing what is truly happening, he will lose his freedom/life. It would mean that his life experiences, the only thing by which people are governed, are observed and influenced by someone else. The century of speed, especially, has scared me. Humanity is heading rapidly into the unknown, and one day the robot will say "I will live" and "I will see." It won't be long before they consider themselves observers and will also conduct experiments with great success. Will we still have control?
