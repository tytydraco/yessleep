My name is Elizabeth Summers.

I was the mother of a beautiful baby girl named Emily. She was my world. My everything.

On the last night of September, me and my husband Henry got into a huge argument. I don't remember over what exactly, but I grabbed my coat and Emily, and began to head out until Henry pushed me into the counter.

The shock from the hit caused me to drop Emily who landed head first with a loud thud. Filled with rage I took a kitchen knife from the drawer and rammed it into Henry's neck.

Henry stumbled to the ground bleeding to death. I panicked and snatched his wallet and keys then headed outside with Emily. We got in his car and sped off.

I recall crying on the drive out of state, thinking about how I could lose Emily. How I left her without a father and if the police find me, a mother.

After a good hour or two, we stopped at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. The sign read 'Day & Night Motel'. A large sun with a moon on its' back spun on top of the sign.

I parked the car in front of the main office. I locked the doors when I got out and made sure to keep the car and Emily in sight as I entered.

A rude employee sat at the counter. He ignored me and kept his eyes glued on the television hanging overhead. After I threw a coin at him from my pocket, he finally paid me attention.

He had me sign my name and phone number on a paper then we continued on with the payment. I used Henry's card and took the keys after it went through.

Taking Emily out of the car I walked us over to our room, 204. It lied on the second floor all the way to the far end.

I opened the door and laid Emily on the bed. I stayed with her for a while then stepped into the bathroom to wash my face. Not because it was dirty, but just to calm myself down.

An odd static sound came from the room like a television just turned on to no signal. The strange part about it was I didn't remember seeing any television in the room when we entered.

Emily started to cry so I instinctively rushed into the room to comfort her. I froze in my tracks as a tall creature with tangled wires forming a body and a television for a head stood before me. A car battery rested in what could otherwise be thought of as its' chest or heart.

The television creature dangled Emily upside down as she continued crying. It turned to face me as soon as I had walked into the room.

That's when I saw the scariest thing any mother could ever witness. Something I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemies.

Almost as if my presence enraged it, the creature swung Emily up into the air then down into the ground with full force. Upon impact, Emily's head completely shattered, silencing her cries.

Words cannot describe the sheer pain and agony that overtook me. My entire universe was just destroyed before my very eyes.

I couldn't move. Not until the creature then lunged at me and wires wrapped themselves around my neck. Crying and screaming, I tried kicking the creature off of me but to no avail.

It proceeded to shove my upper body into the television screen. I expected to feel the glass breaking and the pieces cutting away at my face, but no.

Instead I passed through like thick muddy water. The static shock pulling at my hair. I held onto the sides of the television for dear life, trying to not get sucked in.

My head inside, I glanced around. It was a house. An old rotting house. A house you would see in a horror movie. I seen this house before. Many times.

It is I thought. The house from the horror movie Henry once took me to go see. I was inside the horror movie. Or just barely as I continued holding onto the television.

The killer from the movie appeared. In his classic attire. When he took notice, he charged at me, arm swinging. I screamed even louder until an arm reached out from behind me and grabbed my shoulder. It pulled me out and I was relieved to see the employee from the office.

But only for a moment as the television instead grabbed and completely devoured him. For a few split seconds I caught the employee in the horror movie as the killer slashed away at his chest and stomach.

The creature proceeded to go after me once more. I jumped back up and ran inside the bathroom, locking the door. It was useless as the creature easily burst the door open.

I threw myself into the bathtub and grabbed the shower head. Quickly turning the water on, I directed it towards the creature's battery-heart. I kept my back onto the wall as the creature begun to scream.

The scream or screams sounded human and came from the television. "Let us out!" I thought I heard them say. The creature collapsed as the water fried its' battery. The television that was its' head fell onto the ground, cracking the screen.

I let the water run as I sat down in the tub. Attempting to make sense of what just happened.

I'm currently staying with a friend. They agreed to keep my stay private until I decide what to do. I know through a relative that the cops are currently looking for me.

Although my friend has trouble believing my story, she agreed to get rid of all televisions and computers in her house. I didn't ask her to so I could feel safer. They just trigger that god awful memory of seeing my poor Emily meet such a cruel end.

But I still think about those last few screams I heard. Wondering if they came from other horror movies playing in the background. Or people like that motel employee who are stuck in whatever strange reality exists in that creature's [head](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBatBelfry/s/pYdfr5sMvf)...
