This morning was like sticking my hand in a pocket full of shit and razor blades. I got up like usual, my tent pole at attention, and strutted into the commode like I do. My bathroom is tiny, so when I take care of myself in the early hours, I recline against the sink and jack it into the shower. I'm an old pro who can crank it with my eyes closed most days. But something was different this morning.

I look down after my release, and there's like tiny spiders all over the tiles in the shower and shit. I mean, first, I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. I thought, well, shit, there's an infestation, and I'll have to swing by Wal-Mart for insecticide. But then, as I'm grinding out my second one, I glance down, and I realize that the spiders are coming out of my dick. Just right through my dick hole. That's fucked up.

Little baby spiders are just running out of my dick and up the walls of my shower. I lose my shit. I don't usually scream like a newborn rabbit. I just take life as it comes, but I watched baby spiders crawl out of my pee hole.

That's when my brain stopped. I started to go over my day like I had missed something. I was just like, wake up, take care of business, cum in the shower, run the water to wash it down so it doesn't get all crusty. It felt like I missed a step, so I kept cranking it.

I was panic jerking. But I watched it carefully this time when it shot out and hit the shower tile.

It was nothing but legs and scuttling little black dots. They were just everywhere, skittering. All up and down the shower.

I was all, “what the hell. That's not right.”

And I look down again, and all over my hands are baby spiders. All over my hands. Just running around as happy as can be.

You don't know how itchy until you have little baby spiders run up and down your hands and private areas, you know what I mean. It's nasty.

I didn't know what to do. I screamed, pumped, and watched them skittering fuckers shoot into the shower, but they just kept coming. No pun intended.

Part of my brain was like, "How's that work?" Are they inside me? How'd they get in there?

I looked down, and what I thought was just the usual tightness of morning wood was not that—I'll tell you that right now—it was much worse.

My sack was swollen, undulating like a possum in a pillowcase. It was unnatural inside that sack. And that's messed-up stuff right there.

So I did the only thing I could do. I got to work, you know. I had to drain the reservoir, as it were.

I kept at it, and I kept at it, and it seemed like no matter how much cum got out, it didn't matter. There were always more spider babies ready to go.

I felt helpless. What the hell would I tell my lady’s. “Listen, Breana, Belinda, and Breana Lee, you can't ride the rocket anymore unless you want a cooch full of creepy crawlies.” Hell no. Who wants to have that conversation?

Dear fucking copay I was going to have to go to the doctor and shit.

I figured they'd have to cut my balls off. I assume that's what's going to have to happen. I'll be one of them eunuchs from the dragon show. Because no matter how much I pump out, they're just more spider babies.

Jesus, Jesus' mother, and Joseph. That's some messed up stuff right there.

If that ain't bad enough, I think, they think I'm their daddy or mama or something. They came running for me. After they hit the wall. After they hit the tile. They just come running for me. Little baby legs just swarm me, swarm me, and try to crawl up my feet. They creep up my legs and try to nest themselves back underneath my undercarriage.

Mostly, I screamed and slapped at the little fuckers. A few times, I punched myself in the groin really hard and tried to get them to fall off. Little baby spider legs kept coming no matter how hard I punched them.

What did I do to deserve this?

I flipped off a nun once. That might have done it. I don't know if she was a nun or a lady in the dark coat, but that might have done the trick. Freaking cursed by a nun to have spider babies in my balls.

There's no way back from this. I'm going to go to the doctor.

Dr. Clemens is going to see those nesting spider babies. She's going to see all that mess where my balls were, and she'll just shake her head.

She'll say, "There's Nothing we can do, Jeb. We're going to have to cut these fuckers out."

Then the next thing you know, I'm growing tits because I can't afford testosterone shots, and everything's going to go wrong in my life.

I mean, I can probably find someone to be into me having no balls and tits because, you know, people are into what they are into. So, maybe it won't be all bad, but I won't get any release out of it. That's just a fact. That's just a gosh darn fact.

So I'm feeling bad, frankly. You know. What the hell am I going to do?

After my brain unfroze, I let the babies nest. I said, "Well, I just have to turn on the water and jump in the shower." And I did.

I hopped in, turned the shower on hot, and the rest swarmed up and down my body, just creepy crawling little legs and scalding water. They were all over my hair and eyes because whenever I shot them out, I shot them out all over the shower stall. I'm not one to brag, but when I cum there's some real velocity.

Anyway, they're all swarming me, but I'm letting the water burn them off. I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to get rid of you little babies," so I start dancing around. The whole time, I'm screamin and dancin'. The whole time.

Because you just can't not scream. All right. At one point, I couldn't see because I was crying. But, you know, that's just something that will happen when you jizz spiders. You're gonna cry.

That's not anything that a man should be worried about. I think if you took any man and were like, hey, listen, you are going to wake up in the morning and start cumming spiders, I think that man is going to cry.

That doesn't say anything wrong about them as individuals. Or anything about themselves other than that they're rational beings. We all understand that spider jizzing is not something that anyone would normally do, you know.

Anyway, the spiders were going down the drain, which was a win for me, and I started thinking—I started really thinking.

Then I say to myself, "Self. These little baby spiders are living inside of me. What are they eating? They're eating nuts, that's what they're eating."

That's when I completely fucking lose it. I try my best to get all those cum spiders out. I jerk, and I grind, and I slap, and I pray. That's when the sobs really started. I was like," Oh my God. Damn. Jesus, please."

I did that soundless ugly cry. It's like when you can't cry anymore; your mouth just opens, and you're screaming, but you can't actually scream. It's like dropping an engine on your foot. It's like that. You know something terrible has happened, but you just can't catch your wind enough to make all the sadness come out.

The spiders started going away. Like, I just kept at it while I prayed to the good lord to make the cum keep coming. I cranked that knob until I couldn't do it anymore. Then I let that scalding water wash them little babies off of me.

Finally I took a look.

It's pretty bad. There's a lot of red down there. I'm alive, but I'm fairly certain Urgent Care will be an unfortunate experience.
