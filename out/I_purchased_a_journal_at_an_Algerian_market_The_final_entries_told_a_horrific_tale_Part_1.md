I travel a lot. Without getting too in-depth about the particulars of my life and career, I will say that my job ends up taking me all over the world. I’ve been to just about every continent on the planet, with the exception of somewhere like Antarctica, and the number of countries I haven’t stepped foot in rapidly shrinks every year. It’s absolutely amazing, as I’ve been able to see and partake in so many different customs, cultures and lifestyles. And one thing I always love to do is purchase a souvenir to take home with me, a sort of keepsake to mark my first time in a new country that I can take down from the shelf and look at when the nostalgia hits me. It can be anything, whether an ornamental figurine, a glass, or a book.

That’s where the reason I’m writing and posting here comes in. You see, a few months ago I was sent to Algeria to help oversee a business deal that a client was involved in. The main dealings had wrapped up, and after a few days of exploring the capital city of Algiers, I decided to take a final stroll through one of the many bazaars I had come to adore perusing in my off-time the day before my flight left back to the States. I’d already had it in mind to find something to buy as a memento, and so I strolled past the vendors selling fruit and other various foods, looking for something interesting. And as I passed a table which was selling various bits and bobs, it caught my eye.

It was an old, leather-bound journal, clasped tightly shut with what appeared to be a belt closure of some kind. The leather looked extremely weather beaten and worn, as if it had sat in the burning desert sun for decades, and the edges of the pages I could see were yellowed with age. My curiosity piqued, I pointed to it and asked the seller about where it had come from. Rather strangely, he seemed wary of saying exactly where and when it had come into his possession, instead only saying that he’d stumbled across it during his travels. My curiosity now firmly in the red zone due to its mysterious nature, I inquired to its price. He had no sooner quoted me a price than I was pushing the money into his hand; it was practically a steal. However, I admit one thing which…unnerved me, to say the least. As I hurried away back in the direction of my hotel, I chanced a look over my shoulder. And found that the man was watching me leave, a strange and almost intense look on his face.

That night, my bags packed and lying in bed, I found myself unable to sleep. After trying to tempt the Sandman for a few hours, I finally gave up, and wanting something to pass the time, I picked the journal up, unbuckled it and opened it to the first page. To my surprise, I found the entries were in English. The journal had belonged to a British explorer and adventurer, whose name, according to the inscription on the back of the cover, was Liam Wentworth. The dates inside ranged from the late 1940s, to the early ‘50s, and I read each page with rapt attention, extraordinary images swirling in my mind as Liam narrated to me expeditions which ranged from continental Europe to Africa. I couldn’t help but smile as the infectious excitement in his writing pulled me further and further into the past, and I almost wished I could be transported back in time to join him.

That was, until I began to read the last expedition logged in the journal.

From the very first entry, I could tell there was something different about this particular journey. Something about the man’s words filled me with an unexplainable sense of unease. And as the entries went on, I felt any sense of excitement and wonder wash away like a flood victim, the initial uneasiness first replaced with tension, then a strange sense of paranoia, and finally, as much as I hate admitting it…fear. A palpable sense of fear and existential dread I’ve never felt before, one which raised all the hair on my arms and, even in the safety of my hotel room, made me turn on every single light, banishing away any shadows in the corner. Especially because the final written pages are stained with a long dried liquid that…God, I still hope isn’t what I think it is.

And when my plane took off from Houari Boumediene the next morning, my window giving me a clear view of the sprawling Algerian desert stretching out away into the distance, I involuntarily shuddered.

For months I was unsure of what to do. I considered taking the journal to a historian or museum to verify its authenticity, but I’m worried that it will be simply written off as a hoax or a forgery. The few friends and acquaintances of mine I have shared a little of the contents with have met it with the same response. “It has to be a stunt. Just something to scare whoever bought it” Worse still, I’ve had some of the worst nightmares of my life, horrible dreams that wake me up covered in a sheen of sweat, even months later.  Finally though, after discovering this website, and more importantly this particular page on it, I feel here would be the best place to share it.

Written below, transcribed exactly as originally written, are all the relevant entries from Liam’s last expedition. I may need to split them up into two parts due to the length of some of them. Let me know what you think of it when you’re done reading. And, if there is any shred of truth to what is written here…as much as it might cost me work in the future, I may never step foot in that part of the world again.

 

***Monday, 23 June, 1952***

*After a four-month rest, another adventure is at hand! A fortnight ago, I received a call at home from a wealthy American, a business magnate by the name of Talley. Apparently, Mr. Danvers had boasted of my qualifications and invaluable help during his expedition to Mauritania at a luncheon with him, and when told of a similar endeavor that the man wished to embark on in the nearby country of Algeria, he instantly recommended me to him. I was already interested when he told me of his intentions, and after he quoted me the fee he would pay, I hastily accepted. The amount of money offered is the kind that not even many film stars in the country receive; indeed, it is triple what Diana Dors was reportedly paid recently for her part in The Last Page. And with my dear sister’s health always in flux, it is an amount I would be a fool to refuse.*

*And so, after much planning and subsequent connecting flights from London, I am now in the city of Algiers, where the rest of our party have assembled. I first met Talley as he met me just outside the airport. A tall, lanky chap with thinning black hair, he instantly struck me as inexperienced with such expeditions. It set me a little on edge, if I may be frank; too many parties have tragically failed due to such sponsors. Yet, as I was taken to a nearby café and introduced to the rest of the team, I felt somewhat relieved at the faces that greeted us. Three of the expedition’s nine members are ones I have worked with before: Soren, a hulking giant of a Dane, Richter, a quiet, yet intimidating German, and Moretti, whose boastful demeanor sometimes hides how brilliant of an leader the Italian can be. Three of the other four, excluding myself and Talley, are people who I’ve heard spoken of in similar circles. Blake is the group’s archaeologist, a fellow Brit and alluring brunette who seems as if she should be on the movie screen instead of here. Corrin is the group’s medic, a bloke who earned the scars on his face from his time in the War. And Samir is one of our two guides, a man who’s wild hair and beard doesn’t seem to match the intelligence that I see behind his eyes.*

*The final member of the group is our second guide, an almost gaunt young man no older than twenty; whose name I was told is Tarek. He did not speak when introductions were given: instead, he merely nodded at us. I find he gives me an uncomfortable sort of aura, but according to both Talley and Moretti, he is indispensable to our ultimate goal. Which is when discussion shifted over to our ultimate aim.*

*In a hushed tone, Talley leaned in and told us of a tale he had stumbled across during his dealings in the area. He had hinted about a great treasure lost in the desert decades ago over the phone, but as I listened to him extrapolate, I felt my jaw drop open. According to accounts, a decade and a half or so ago, a group of soldiers belonging to the French Foreign Legion searching for a safe haven had stumbled upon a fortress built into a vast mountain range. Centuries old, the structure had been abandoned, and after discovering that a pump connected to an underground water source of some kind, the soldiers had set up a base camp, complete with radio and arsenal. They stayed in contact with their superiors for approximately five months, reporting back periodically and requesting supplies. Then, on the sixth month, the fort went silent. No matter how long it was hailed, no one ever answered the radio calls. A reinforcement group had been sent to try and ascertain what had happened to them, but they seemed to disappear into the desert as well. Eventually, all of the men were declared lost in action; it wouldn’t have been the first time that soldiers had met their end on the receiving end of the local’s swords and guns, after all. Fearing further casualties, the fort was declared a hostile zone, and any further attempt to reach it was forbidden.*

*As the years went by, and with the outbreak of The War, the fort’s location and the reports on it were lost in the shuffle, further hampered by the fact that it seemed someone in a high position had stricken it from all maps and public record. But, somehow, after hearing the stories, Talley had used his connections to obtain one of the only remaining maps which marked its location. As he finished, I cocked an eyebrow and asked him how this all connected to what he had lured me here with: the reports of a vast, lost treasure. An almost childish smile spread across Talley’s face. “You ain’t heard the best part yet, my dear boy!” That was when the penny dropped. According to a radio report that the fort’s commanding officer had made, they had found, in the bowels of the fort, a room which, when breached, had revealed a staggering amount of jewels, coins, and other treasures. The exact monetary value it had, had never been calculated, but seeing as how most of the hoard was dated back to the Ottoman Empire, it had to be a tremendous amount. By this point, our sponsor had our undivided attention, and dreams of being forever logged in the history books danced in our heads.*

*That’s when Talley let us in on the most important fact of this expedition. “If we locate the fort and find the treasure was only a tale, or fail to find it at all, you all will be paid the exact amount I quoted you,” he began, his eyes twinkling, “But, if we do find it, each of you will receive an equal share of the treasure, in addition to your name’s forever written as the finders”*

*To say that you could have heard a pin drop amongst us would be a grievous understatement. For a moment, nobody spoke. I was the first to open my mouth. “Yes! Bloody hell, yes!” As if my words had been a sort of catalyst, everyone else quickly piped up with their own agreement. Talley beamed: he knew he had ensnared us, and he reveled in it. He told us that we would board a plane bound for In Sallah the next day; from there, we would continue on in Land Rovers into the desert itself. And with that, he bid us goodnight, retiring with Moretti to their hotel. After a few drinks, the rest of us disbanded as well. And now, here I sit, staring out the window at the rising moon with my pen in hand. I am beyond thrilled. The prospect of becoming wealthy beyond my wildest dreams, of being able to afford all of my sister’s medicine and procedures, to say nothing of my own frivolities and fantasies is intoxicating.*

*And yet. I can’t help but feel a strong sense of trepidation over what I was told as well. The fact that two different groups of soldiers seemed to simply disappear without a trace, it gives me pause. Even though I attempt to push it away, a small whisper of dread climbs over me. I picture the men cowering in the night, guns frantically aimed into the dark as…something moves towards them. But surely, anything that happened to them so long ago, any people who did them harm surely have moved on. Which means we should be perfectly safe.*

*I worry too much.*

***Tuesday, 24 June, 1952***

*I write this entry by the firelight next to my tent, the only thing that banishes away the almost impermeable darkness that stalks the edges of the flickering embers. Early in the morning, just before the sun rose, our team boarded a chartered plane and flew south to In Sallah. There, we found two Land Rovers, paint shimmering and fresh off the production line in Solihull; they had been specially ordered by Talley for the journey. Supplies and enough fuel to last us a fortnight were loaded onboard, and, after wedging ourselves inside the space that remained, we set off in a westerly direction, following the road past towns with names such as In Ghar and Aoulef. Finally, we passed through Reggane, and after a last look back at civilization, we left the road and headed out into the desert itself.*

*Saying that the intense heat would rival the flames of Hell itself would not be much of an understatement. The sun beat mercilessly down upon our vehicles, turning them into saunas, and as we were attempting to conserve our water supply, soon we all felt the first inklings of heat exhaustion. After stopping to quench our thirst quickly, and following the blessed liquid with lunch, we continued on as the sun dipped lower into the sky. As I was riding with Talley, I had the opportunity to ask him about Tarek. The man still gave me a bad feeling, and I inquired as to why he was so important to our expedition. After all, I asked, would simply Samir not make a decent enough guide?*

*It was then that he revealed to me the secret surrounding the man. Tarek was one of few men left alive who had seen the fort with his own eyes. Or so he claimed. He had told Talley of a time as a small boy, traveling through the desert with his father and grandfather, and spying on the horizon, perched atop a mountain range like a sentry, the imposing structure. Both of his elders had warned him away from it, telling him that it was a cursed place. “Load of local superstitious bull” Talley said to me, waving a hand as if to physically repel the words. For my part, I, too, did not believe in such things, and yet, at his words I was unable to suppress the shiver that flew up my spine slightly. It felt…too coincidental, too close to the feeling of dread that fell over me last night. A second thought came to mind, and pushing away the emotions, I asked, with not knowing if the young man was telling the truth, how he could be sure he was not simply luring us into the desert for a sinister purpose. With a small, almost concealed wink, he raised his shirt, revealing a hidden pistol underneath in a holster. He informed me that several others were armed as well, and a shotgun and ammunition were among our supplies.*

*“Liam, my boy, relax. I’ve thought of everything. We’ll be ready, whether the locals have any surprises in store for us, or either of our guides do. Just enjoy the trip in the meantime”*

*I pray that his confidence is not misplaced. We are a long way from where anyone could help us if things were to go belly up. And that isn’t all. I’m the only member of our group still awake. All the others have retired to their tents, or in the case of Tarek and Samir, into the Land Rovers to sleep. The only sounds I hear are the crackling of the fire, and the soft, almost lonely sound of the wind whistling in the darkness. And yet…I can’t help but feel watched. Even though we are certainly the only people for miles, I feel as though eyes are upon me. Upon all of us. It is a feeling that is most unwelcome, and it makes me again wonder about the fates that befell the French soldiers. I find myself shooting looks out into the dark every few lines I write, almost convinced I will see eyes staring back at me from the blackness.*

*As much as I don’t want to, I must retire to my own tent. Dawn will be here soon enough, and we will need all of our strength for the next few days.*

***Thursday, 26 June, 1952***

*After a second day of driving straight and following both the map and directions that Samir tells us that Tarek has given us, as the man speaks no English, we seem to have finally arrived at the base of a mountain range. According to Tarek, these are the mountains in question, and we are not far now, less than a day away. I crane my neck to look up at the imposing walls which rise high over our heads. I’m not a good estimator of such things, but I would not be surprised if the top lies hundreds of feet above us or more. If the fort is real, than how are we to get to it from down here? All questions that will have to be answered soon. For now, though, I will go and sit with the others, eat supper and go to sleep. If we are being told the truth, tomorrow will be the day.*

***Friday, 27 June, 1952***

*It’s real! I find that even as I write these words, I feel I’ll suddenly wake up from a dream. And yet, right there in front of my eyes is the bloody thing! Tarek was indeed telling the truth. And it looks exactly as Talley heard. The structure is perfectly nestled atop and similarly among the mountains, surely built there by some Ottoman architect or soldier with a perfect idea of strategic planning; the fort has a clear view down to the desert where we stand below and is set far enough back that the surrounding land acts as a sort of natural shield. It is the perfect choke point, to say the least; Churchill himself would be impressed.*

*According to the Blake, the style and architecture is indeed indicative of the Ottoman Empire, either Arabic or North-African. The three front turrets rise imposingly above the rest of the complex, their windows dark and unrevealing of their secrets. Surprisingly, and thankfully as well, there will be no need to worry about climbing. Tarek pointed us to a set of steps carved into the mountains themselves. They are fairly steep, but they surely beat the alternative. As it is late, we will make camp here at the base tonight, and in the morning we will pack all our supplies, and make the climb to the fort itself.*

*Finally, I must admit that the feeling I had in the desert two nights ago remains. In fact, it almost feels stronger in a way. But with the excitement palpable amongst all of us, I refuse to let it sour the mood. It will be stored away in the recesses of my mind. Tomorrow, we begin to take a step towards both history, and possibly fortune.*

***Saturday, 28 June, 1952***

*I write from inside the central courtyard of the fort itself. I was correct in my assessment that it would be a steep climb, but aside from a few scrapes among all and a bloody knuckle suffered by Soren, we reached the top uneventfully. From there, we found a path already made, albeit almost hidden by the ever sweeping sands. But the cracked wooden rail that marked the edge of the cliff showed the way. After a trek of about a quarter of an hour, we found ourselves at a gate which marked the outer rim of the complex. The top was wrapped in barbed wire, and an unlocked gate sat half open in front of us. Richter, feeling that we would be better off closing it behind us, walked into a neighboring guard post and lowered a barrier to prevent anyone entering when our backs were turned. Together, we made our way up a steep path to the front of the fort itself. At the front gates, we discovered a relic from the First World War: a French FT tank, sitting empty and half buried in the sand. The turret faced away from us, back the way we’d come, and I wondered both how it had gotten up here, and what it had been put in place for. With a last look at the armament, we pushed open one of the two colossal wooden doors and entered the fort.*

*We found ourselves inside an expansive courtyard that stretched out before us and to both sides. To the right was what appeared to be a smaller courtyard of some sort, embellished with a few small bushes and date palms. Wandering over to it, I found that at the far end of the smaller space was a fountain, a rusted pump set into the back corner. Tentatively, I put out my hand, gathered some water from the fountain and raised it to my lips. The water tasted somewhat stagnant, but otherwise was fine. Reaching out and operating the pump, I found it readily supplied fresh water. Turning, I found Moretti beside me. He smiled. “It’s a water garden. Well then, this solves any concerns of running out of water. There must be an underground lake or river somewhere beneath us” I agreed with him, and after a last look around at the peaceful scene, we returned to the others. After telling them of our discovery, we set our supplies down and began as a group to explore.*

*Aside from the water garden, there were two main buildings inside the fort. The largest building, according to the rickety wooden sign hung by the front door, declared it to be the living quarters, while a second, sunken building was designated the arsenal. After a small deliberation, we chose to enter the main building first. The interior showed that nature had taken its toll on the fort. Beams had collapsed from the upper levels, and sand rose up in small mounds, making us have to navigate around the debris. The rest of the quarters were in much the same condition, though with much more signs of life; pillows, rugs and other furniture were around. There were also plenty of candles and lamps hanging from beams above, all of which we lit as we passed. We located the radio room, which I noted with a pang of unease had been vandalized; both the radio and Morse code machines had been destroyed. Clearly, someone had not wanted anyone to send any messages or calls for help.*

*What made the scene worse, was the obvious signs of struggle which were ever present throughout the whole building. Some of the group didn’t notice, but I saw that Soren and Richter, along with myself, the three who saw the most combat in our lives, did. The spilled chairs, crumpled blankets and broken glass and wood all told a tale; it was one that made the feeling of dread rear its head in my mind. And worse, the feeling of eyes on me was at a feverish pitch. As we made our way through, my head swung about like an owl’s, looking not only into the shadows, but up into the rafters as well. At one point as I brought up the rear of the group, it felt as though fingers had slipped along the nape of my neck, and my pulse quickened, my breathing going shallow as I froze on the spot. Terror filling every fiber of my being, I whirled around. And found no one. All I could hear was the soft creaking of the building, and the whistling of the wind outside. Not wanting to remain alone, I hurried after the others.*

*After leaving the main quarters, and with daylight fading fast, we made a quick pass through the arsenal. Where we discovered a grisly scene. In the fort’s jail, we discovered the remains of a man dressed in one of the old uniforms which designated him as part of the French Foreign Legion. His body seemed to cower in the far corner of the cell, away from any of the bars. Stranger still, Samir pointed out that he had locked himself inside; a set of keys could be seen by the desiccated corpse’s hand. From what we could tell, the man hadn’t died of any injuries either. Morretti surmised that he must’ve either perished from hunger or thirst.*

*We retreated back to the courtyard after, where we set up camp in the water garden. For this, I’m eternally grateful. While the living quarters may offer more shelter from the elements than the tents, I would not be able to sleep a wink inside. I feel constantly on edge after what has been seen today, and I pray to the Lord that, in time, they will fade from memory. And I still feel we are watched. In fact, the feeling is stronger than it ever was. As if whatever is doing the watching is almost directly over us, staring down. I wonder if the feeling has anything to do with the corpse in the arsenal jail. After all, what could drive a man to such terror, that he would rather face a slow death from lack of food and water than it? Perhaps…I hope I never find out. Nor where the rest of the soldiers disappeared to.*

*I hope we can find the fabled treasure quickly and be gone from this place. As much as I love adventure, I long for being back in the bedroom of my home in Maidenhead.*

***Monday, 30 June, 1952***

*Two days have passed since my last entry. We have continued to work to locate any hint of the treasure, but have failed to find any trace of it anywhere in the fort. I am beginning to think it may never have existed. Talley is trying to bolster all our spirits, but I can sense him begin to grow weary. Like the rest of us. That foreboding feeling that has hung over my head like a noose seems to have spread among the expedition; I see it in all of their faces. It increased when we found more signs of a struggle around the fort; fingernail marks etched into walls as if someone were dragged away, spent ammo casings and more. I catch others swinging around erratically, as though they had sensed somebody near them. I caught Samir, Tarek and Corrin huddled together, whispering softly to one another. When I approached, hearing words about leaving spoken, they stood up straight and gave me a strange look before moving quickly away. I also find that Blake tends to stick close to me now; she says it’s because she feels safest with another from Britain, but I know there’s a deeper reason she will not admit. Back in The War, my Sergeant had told me that paranoia is one of the forces that whittle men down the quickest. I do believe he is right.*

***Tuesday, 1 July, 1952***

*We are trapped. During the night, I awoke to hear a thunderous crashing sound, but in the darkness, I didn’t know what it was. When daylight broke, we set out for the steps down to the Land Rovers.*

*We found that, during the night, something had caused a large section of them to give way. Whether it be a crack in the rock which caused a landslide of some sort, it doesn’t matter. The section is too vast to be able to safely jump down from, a gap of over two hundred feet. And without rope, we couldn’t climb down. We are stuck, hundreds of feet above the desert floor, with no signs of people anywhere. Fortunately, Tarek informed us through Samir that he believed as a boy, he had seen a way down, further down the ridge. After a quick deliberation, it was decided that Samir, along with Richter would set out and try and find it. The weapons we had brought were finally broken out from our supplies, and the two men were given a pistol each, along with a small supply of extra ammunition and two torches. They said they would attempt to return at nightfall if they could not find a way down.*

*It is dusk now, and they have not returned yet. I worry that they may have slipped and fallen to their deaths, or worse, may have successfully made it down and bolted. While I may have worked with Richter before, and heard good things about Samir, in a situation like this, even the most rational men can do the wrong things. I-*

*Wait. I thought I just heard something. The silence has fallen again over the fort, but for a second, as the wind had died, I almost swore I heard a cracking sound in the distance. Two, three times. Then nothing. But it sounded too small to be gunshots. It can’t have been.*

*I hope they come back soon.*

***Wednesday, 2 July, 1952***

*Samir and Richter never returned. At dawn, I volunteered to try and set out to find any trace of them. Blake asked to accompany me, as did Corrin, who said if they were injured, they would need his training. So, gathering the medical kit, we prepared to leave, when Morretti stopped us. “I want you to take this” he said. Reaching into a supply bag, he withdrew the shotgun, what I instantly recognized as a Winchester Model 1897. Handing it to me, he also pulled out a box of shells and passed them to Blake, who placed them in her pack. “Be safe, and God be with you” he said. I nodded, and holding the gun tightly in both hands, the three of us stepped out of the fort and, after locating two sets of footprints, set out following them.*

*None of us spoke a word as we followed the trail along, occasionally having to navigate around boulders and past treacherously narrow paths in what I hoped would lead us to our compatriots, our friends. But as we continued on, the footprints seeming to endlessly continue, I began to feel as though we three had, like them, seemingly slipped into an alternate reality where we would forever be trapped, alone.*

*That was when we discovered the end of the tracks. I don’t mean to say that they led to a way down, or even to the edge of the cliff. Rather, both sets came to a halt in the middle of an open space, dominated by low hanging cliff faces behind us. “This…this doesn’t make any sense,” Corrin said as he looked around, “Where in the hell did they go?” Neither of us could answer him, but as I focused again on the tracks, I noticed two small details I hadn’t before. Ones which made my heart begin to beat quicker in my chest.*

*The first was that the footsteps, once so orderly and in rhythm with one another, suddenly began to erratically dance around each other. Almost as if the men had begun wildly spinning around, looking in all directions. The second was the glint of brass I saw almost hidden among the sand. I reached out with one hand and, brushing away the top layer that had settled over it the night before, found myself looking at several spent bullet casings. There were approximately three or four of them, all clumped together as though someone had emptied a revolver on the spot. I picked one up, rolling it over in my fingers. The beating sun had made it almost too hot to handle, but I could instantly tell they were fresh. Wariness and dread began to gnaw at my insides. Something had happened here.*

*That was when I heard Blake gasp.*

*Turning, I found her staring at a section of wall behind and to the left of us, a section which had been obscured by an overhang before. Her face had gone as white as a sheet, and her eyes as wide as saucers. With a trembling hand, she pointed at something, and moaned out three words.*

*“Mother of God”*

*A single smear of blood ascended the rock face. It wasn’t a lot, but it was enough to spike my dread into full blown terror. Quickly arching my neck, I couldn’t see where it would lead to, but was obvious that its owner had been dragged upwards, and in a violent manner. Instantly, I raised the shotgun, feeling my hands go cold and clammy. Blake and Corrin huddled behind me as we all looked around rapidly, both at the overhang above us, and farther down the path. All I could hear was the whistle of the wind, nothing more. And that fact alone terrified me to no end. That whistle. The silence. It all seemed to hold a threatening edge to it now. A prelude to something horrific to come.*

*I motioned silently for the others to begin to back up behind me, alternating the shotgun’s aim between the area above us and in front of us. Trying not to make any noise, we slowly began to move back to the fort. As we retreated, I swear I thought I heard the small pitter-patter sound of pebbles moving. I thought I saw a slight blur of motion just beyond my line of sight. My heart was racing in my chest, and my mouth turned as dry as cotton. In my time during The War, I had bore witness to many horrific sights. Many atrocities. More than once I was sure I was about to die. And I swear on my sister’s soul, that I never felt as terrified as I did in those moments, my hands holding the gun beginning to shake.*

*Despite feeling as though whatever had taken Samir and Richter were lurking just beyond our field of view, we made it back to the fort unharmed. As soon as we were inside, I dropped the shotgun to the ground, and Richter and I found what must have been the board to barricade the front doors, working together to pick it up and slam it into place in the large metal hooks. As we did so, the others raced out from the water garden, demanding to know why we were sealing them inside. Corrin turned to them as we finished, his eyes wild and face ashen in the fading light. “Because Samir and Richter are fucking dead, that’s why!” His use of profanity slammed the words home, and I saw horrified looks cross everyone’s faces. Even Tarek’s, even if he couldn’t understand us that well. Trying to remain calm, I stepped forward and, with as much rational clarity as I could muster, explained in crystal clarity everything we had seen, everything we had come across.*

*As I finished, a deathly silence settled over us all. In those moments, all we could hear was the wind, which had now risen from a whistle into a howl. The sun was beginning to set on the horizon, and it cast eerie shadows over the fort’s courtyard. Nobody dared speak as the implications of our predicament sunk in.*

*Until I began to hear a low whine.*

*For a moment, I was unable to discern where it came from, but as I looked around, I realized it was coming from Tarek. The Algerian looked, if possible, petrified to death and beyond. His face held the expression of one which had just had a death sentence passed on. The whine intensified, and he suddenly began to babble, speaking rapid strings of sentences that I didn’t understand. “What is he saying?!” Talley demanded. Morretti, knowing a little Arabic, raised a hand to silence him and stepped forward, asking a question to the panicking man. In response, Tarek babbled some more at him, and after a moment, I saw Morretti’s brow furrow in confusion. He asked another question and received another panicked response. Talley stepped forward. “What did he say, Alessandro? Please, tell me!” Morretti continued to look at Tarek for a moment, then turned towards us.*

*“I’m not sure, but I think he says that…they are in the mountains. They hunt in the mountains. And they are why his father and grandfather warned him to stay away from here” Suddenly, and without warning, Tarek turned and bolted for the fort’s living quarters. I saw Morretti begin to take a step after him, but then stopped. We watched as the man slammed his shoulder into the door, rushing inside and slamming it shut behind him. Fortunately, we did not hear it lock. After a moment, Talley turned back to us. He took a deep breath. “Alright, everyone. We need a plan” The man’s words seemed to bolster us, and we quickly and quietly began talking amongst ourselves. We decided it was no longer safe to stay outside, and following Tarek’s footsteps, we would shelter at night in the living quarters, barricading ourselves inside.*

*We would also try and repair the broken radio, to try and send a call for help. Blake, in addition to being an archaeologist, was also proficient in repairing equipment. Our plan set in motion, we grabbed our supplies from the tents and moved inside.*

*And now, we all huddle, trying to sleep in shifts in one of the main bunk rooms. Blake sleeps beside me; I can hear her uneasily rolling over as I write. Corrin is doing the same a few cots away. Soren and Morretti patrol the halls of the building with two of our four remaining guns. Talley holds onto the third, and in the meantime, I’ve traded Morretti the shotgun for a pistol of my own. I know I should try to rest; my own patrol shift will be in a few hours. And yet, I cannot. I feel as though my dreams will be worse. Dreams seeing what happened to Samir and Richter, seeing them dragged upwards to a fate I feel it is a blessing to not know. And I’m terrified that if I close my eyes, I will open them to find…something looking at me, half-hidden in the shadows from the dull light of the lamp over our heads, ready to leap and end my existence in a blister of pain and horror.*

*God…God please save us.*
