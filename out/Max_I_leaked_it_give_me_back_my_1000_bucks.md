REPORT TITLE: THE “LIGHT” #1  
CONTENTS: Today has been a strange day. I know this has been going on for 2 weeks now, with the “Stone-man”, but today is particularly strange.  
At about 12 A.M. I was just on watch duty. Nothing strange, just the normal, reading my book under the dim light. Then I saw a light flash in my peripheral vision, just at the window’s edge. At first, I brushed it off as my imagination, then I heard a strange humming, as if it was from fluorescent lights. I looked up. It got louder. Just outside my post- As far as I can remember- There was a dim light up ahead. As a fellow brave Patroller I went to investigate. As I was approaching the light the humming got louder. Eventually the humming turned into a woman humming, and now this was 3 miles into the forest, I was surprised nobody had heard it but me.  
The light got brighter and the sound got louder as I approached. It felt like around three minutes that I was looking at it, then my mind went blank. Just empty to the point that I don’t remember where I was. The light disappeared and for some reason I freaked out, Cold sweat and all that, there was as if there was only one thing on my mind: ‘must find light, must find the light.’  I started running in random directions, no clue where  I was, and it felt like a minute before I spotted my buddy. After that… I don’t know what happened, actually. Turns out, as my buddy described it, I had grabbed him on the shoulders and shook him so violently, screaming something like “where is the light, I need it” and looked like a maniac, that he had to knock me out. Three hours later I woke up and asked him about it.   
Now, It’s been three hours since I regained consciousness, and I still feel dizzy, but I figured while this incident is still fresh in my head I’ll write it in the report. While you’re reading this, senior, I would like to apologize if this story sounded unbelievable, but that’s as far as I can remember. For the part where I heard a humming, I am actually not sure if that came from the nearby jeep if i had accidentally let the engine run, and the woman humming may have been my imagination. Trust me, I wish that this incident was fake. In fact, it felt surreal, but my buddy was a witness. I am too giddy to theorize anything about it at the moment, so I shall just leave it until here for now.  
Ronald out.

There you go, Max! Goddamnit. I hope you enjoy this fucking leak. Now give me my thousand back, as you promised. Damnit, never should’ve participated in your stupid little game. This report was one of the easier ones to hack, since it wasn’t viewed so often, and I stayed up late till 1 a.m. to do it AND post it onto r/nosleep, let  alone create an account, AND figure out how this website works. So read up and enjoy, you freak. Enjoy seeing me getting downvoted despite not having any “Karma” or whatever that is. If I get into trouble for this, you're involved too, buddy. Hope we don't get fired.
