A repeated trope in cartoons I saw back in the day was the quicksand trap- a character would wander into a quicksand pit accidentally and then gradually begin to sink to the bottom, before being rescued. Or something even dumber in retrospect- they would come out the other end of the quicksand like a video game portal.

Neither of those things can happen of course. Quicksand is just sand that's had too much water added to it, meaning that it nearly flows like a liquid. The reality is that quicksand by nature is denser than the human body, as in, it would be impossible for you to sink completely into it. As a matter of fact, because your chest contains your lungs that part would remain buoyant enough so you'd only get waist-deep at most. And it would not be the rapid, within seconds kind you often see in media. 

Why am I telling you this? I mean, after all, while a media trope back in the day, it's not something you'd run into during your everyday life, is it? Why even bother thinking about it?

I thought the same thing. Until that day that is.

I had gone hiking with two friends of mine who I'll call Alice and Jake here. Alice was mainly along with  us because she was dating Jake, and Jake was along with me because we'd always joked about going hiking.

None of us were really serious about this all though, and 'hiking' to us was wandering into the local woods not far from where we worked.

It went about as you'd expect- we had fun until the novelty wore off in about an hour. Jake and Alice took some photos for their Instagram while the presence of mosquitos continued to annoy me.

Honestly I wanted to pack up and go home by about lunch, and in hindsight that would've been a great idea. But, I was a bit too proud to say this and we ended up staying into well in the afternoon.

It was as the sun began to set that we made out way back to where we had parked out cars. And we were almost there when Alice turned her head and stopped suddenly.

"What is it" Jake asked.

"I...I think I heard Lizzie's voice," she said.

Jake frowned. I realized he had no clue who Lizzie was, but clearly Alice expected him to know. He shot me a pleading look.

"Uh, sorry, who is Lizzie" I asked on his behalf. 

"My grandmother," she said.

"That can't be possible though your grandmother's-" Jake began to say before cutting himself off.

Alice didn't seem to be upset by what he had almost said, instead looking puzzled, probably convincing herself that she had just been hearing things when her head suddenly snapped in the other direction. 

"No," she said. "I heard it again!"

She bounded off into a bush without warning. We followed her... until we heard her scream.

The thing about quicksand is that it can appear just like normal ground at first, but then changes to become more fluid as you apply force to it. The more you struggle, the more you sink in. 

Alice hadn't figured that part out yet.

Thankfully for her, she hadn't run right into the patch of quicksand, but rather, caught herself in time so that part of her legs were sinking, but part of her was on dry land.

The problem was that Jake would've nearly ran into the pool face-first (he had a habit of leaping before he looked), nearly guaranteeing his death if I hadn't tackled him in time.

I was rewarded for this by a punch to the face, and then gave one back in return. That seemed to snap him out of it.

"Help!" Alice shouted.

It was almost cartoonish now that I look back at it. Jake grabbed onto her hand and tried pulling her out, to no avail. With the way quicksand works, it really isn't possible to pull yourself- or someone else out. It would be easier to lift a car on your own.

"Relax," I said. "Listen, Alice, what you need to do is wiggle yourself slightly. Very slowly." The slow movements allow water to come back in between your body and the sand, helping you get free.

Of course, this is easier said than done, but Alice finally managed to listen to what I was saying before it was too late.

And it was then that I heard it. My uncle's voice- dead ten years ago. Calling from somewhere on the opposite side of the quicksand- I could reach him if only I dived in-

I snapped my thoughts out of the urge to jump and when Alice was finally free, we made a run for it. We didn't look back and all got into Jake's car, leaving mine alone but I went to go pick it up the  next day.

It was only when we were halfway home did Jake ask, "Did anyone else see them?"

Neither of us spoke, though we knew exactly what he was talking about. 

You see, quicksand can still be very deadly. You could end up dying of dehydration if you can't get out in time, or get mauled by a predator... or drowned given that quicksand tends to occur near bodies of water. The place we were in was very close to a pond.

I know what had caused the voices that we had heard. Out on the other side of the quicksand, in the surface of the pond, we saw several things coming out of the water. Heads that looked almost humanoid. 

I still remember their eyes- they were a dark glowing green. I have no idea what they were, Skinwalkers or some other kind of water demons or whatever, but we never went near that park again.

Now that I write this down, I guess in all honesty I don't really expect you to believe me. But if you are going to take something away from it- it's how to survive if you fall into quicksand.

That knowledge just might save your life one day.
