   His wife, Maybelline, yelled at him to give it up about the Chupacabra. John, holding back tears, replied "honey I am trying to keep us safe. 

   His son, Horace, watched from his upstairs Window. He despised his father, he wanted to live a normal life. He was 32 years old and his dad would not let him out past sunset in fear of the Chupacabra. He lit a cigarette and fell right asleep.

Maybelline, while she was in bed alone she realized something about herself. She realized it never occurred to her that she had the answer all along to end all the craze of the Chupacabra. She called up her cousin, Houston, to get a movie set quality animatronic that would resemble the Chupabra.  
It came within the week, but as the delivery man wheeled it in, Maybelline shook at the sound of John Paul screaming in agony. He shrieked "Maybelline! May----belline! AH! Chupacabra! Get inside! AAHhhh Mayybelliinee-"   
 

  Horace, meanwhile in kitchen looks out while happily sipping on some prune juice. He tells the mysterious man on the phone, "We did it, I think we'll get away with murdering my father."  
Horace waits for a second, then says, "Z. Z, you there?"  


"Horaceeee... AHHHHHh.... Help Chupacabra!"  


Unpleased, Horace responds, "Don't fool around Z. If this works out we'll be in the Maldives, and more importantly, away from my father!" Z, on the other end of the phone breaks in and out before screaming, 

"Horacee its got me ahhh! The Chupacabr-" He then hears his dad, John Paul Jones, in the background scream, "Run! GO to my patio, that's where I keep the weapon. Everyone go inside and lock your doors, this is not a joke!"  
   Z reminds John that he's the only property for miles. John Paul Jones, ignores him, and screams, "Look out! Its right behind you! Run!" Z cries out, "John Paul, this Chupacabra is terrifying I  always thought you were crazy." "It is terrifying, I told you." He ran sideways with a minor limp as he scooted through to the porch area where he kept his weapon. Z barely made it, as his leg was torn off as he slid in by the Chupacabra sharp teeth.  


"AH! AHhhhhh!" Z yelled  


   John Paul Jones smiles and tells him he made it. "You guys passed the test."  
The Chupacabra, his friend Rex who is very aggressive, takes off the mask and reveals the mini saw he used as the teeth. "This is how I got your leg, just so you know."  


Z, yelled, "What the hell I have 1 leg now, this is fucked!"  


Yes but now you know valuable advice for when it actually come-- "Oh my God, Maybelline you are the Chupacabra! No not Maybelline." HE falls to his knees and bellows as Maybelline reveals she had known for years she was Chupacabra.   
   John Paul maniacally in tears, cries out between sobs, "I... was.... hunting... you... the.. who-... the whole time?" He slams the wall  out of frustration.  
Horace storms downstairs, and yelled at his dad. "I hate you, and I hate you made mom the Chupacabra!"  
"GO to your room now!" John Paul screamed while crying maniacally still.  


   Z, on the verge of passing out, says to his friend 3 minutes away, "Please hurry, these people are insane. They are yelling at each other about who's the Chupacabra.  
His friend arrives, and as he gets in the car and fades out, he notices his friend, who was named Zander had no last name that he knew of.  
"Zander what is your last name?"   
"You really don't know? He looks at him with a toothy Chupacabra type grin. He slowly reveals his ID, the last name Chup- appearing before Z screams. Zander tells him his last name is Chuppah. Z is relaxed, and wakes up looking John Paul Jones eye to eye. "You cannot leave, Chupacabra reasons, sorry go upstairs."   
   "Z hurries upstairs before hearing John Paul Jones laugh and say, "He fell for it again!" Maybelline laughing takes off her makeup. She is not Chupacabra. John then tells him he now will take him to the ER. They get in the truck and ride out the front yard, and into the interstate. However, John Paul Jones forgot he hasn't driven in 25 years and his truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, leaving them stranded for 4 days. John Paul knows that's more than enough time for a Chupacabra to come get Horace and Maybelline.. As Z takes his last breaths, he hears John Paul yell in frustration, "Man I wish I had stayed home and protected my family from Chupacabra." He turns and looks at Z with crossed eyes.
