17th May, 2015. It was a warm day, ideal for some exploration. I think I'll go beyond the flowers today. "Never go beyond the flowers" I heard my mother's voice in my head. I had grown up hearing this, no questions asked. Jumping in the creek, picking flowers, climbing  trees...I was free to do anything on the vast property grounds. Except crossing the flowers.We lived in a small cottage on a large estate, mum and I. It got lonely at times, but I had the large grounds to frolic around and it had kept me busy so far. At the cusp of teenage rebellion, though, the urge to venture beyond the flowers, into the dark woods was growing by the minute. What can possibly be out there, after all? An old saying meant to keep children out of trouble. Maybe some wolves, but I wasn't worried. I had seen the Gardner cock his gun and take down the silvery beasts. How hard could it be? 

I slipped out, into the shed and carefully lifted the rifle. The metal felt strangely cold in my hands. I wasn't worried about being seen, mum was never really out back here. There were the grounds that extended for miles around me, the edge of the woods a wall in the distance.  There were pretty flowers all over, it was the peak of summer after all. The flowers, however seemed to end abruptly at the treeline. We never went beyond that, remember? We never went into the woods. Proud of having made my way to the woods, I began looking around, my confidence wavering as I saw the trees up close. They loomed ahead, tall, dark...and somehow, menacing. 

'Come on now, don't be silly.' It was my imagination playing tricks on me. They were trees, ordinary. Just trees, right?  I almost didn't notice him. He blended well into the canopy of branches, and I would not have noticed him had the shadows not moved. He seemed as old and gnarled as the trees themselves, bony limbs and a tangle of wild hair. However, I barely saw how he looked. His eyes...so pretty...I'd never seen eyes like those. Were they blue? Brown? I can't tell you. They seemed to reflect every color of the rainbow, pitch black too, and colors I'd never known. His eyes... Ignoring the dull tingle of fear at the back of my neck, I continued looking in the man's eyes, transfixed. I didn't realise that I took a step forward.  Or another. I barely noticed the dull thunk of cold metal falling on the ground. I was crossing the treeline now, he was leading me into the woods. But his eyes...out of the corner of my own eye, I noticed I could no longer see the flowers. Whatever. I couldn't look away, not now. The man stopped now, a few feet ahead of me. His eyes looking in mine. His eyes....his eyes. They were no longer pretty. They were cold and dark now, lifeless. The spell broke, and my heart was pounding in my ears. He was still looking into my eyes, as a slight smile began creeping up his face. Every fibre in my body seemed like it was on fire, as I made a blind dash for home. The trees seemed to close in on me, footsteps behind me. Any minute now. They got closer. The footsteps, the trees. So close now. So close, that I  could see the flowers. Before I knew it, I was in the clearing again, crumpled among the pretty flowers. Steadying my pounding heart, I dared to look behind me. The woods were tranquil, and I was the only one around. 

At home, I tried to be as normal as possible.  Mum would throw a fit if she found out. I was never going out there again, that was for certain. Eager to put the whole thing behind me, I crawled into bed, exhausted. Waves of sleep lolled over me almost immediately, and I was out cold within minutes. 

I had a rather sound sleep, though something was at the back of my mind. I couldn't remember what  but oh well. I took out my phone to check the time, it was not long before I could go out. My eyes caught the calendar,  the blank squares staring back at me. Today was 17th May,  it seemed like a good day to go out and explore. I think I'll go beyond the flowers today...
