The first time I saw the waving lady was about five days ago.

It was broad daylight, and I was at a train station on my way to work. I was already inside the train, leaving the station, when I looked out the window and saw her.

She was wearing a black dress, black leather shoes, and a black medical face mask. Her long, dark, wavy hair framed her face. The moment our eyes met, she lifted her hand and waved.

There were plenty of people inside the train, so I didn’t think the wave was meant for me.

But when I looked around, no one else seemed to react.

Two days later, I was on my way back to my flat after buying some groceries. I saw the same lady in black standing across the street. When I turned my head toward her, she lifted her hand again and waved at me.

She wore a mask, and she didn’t look like anyone I knew, so I quickly assumed she was waving at someone behind me.

Curious, I looked around.

There was no one.

Not a single person.

Weird, but I couldn’t say she was threatening me. She was just waving from a distance.

Then, just this morning, I was at my office on the second floor. My desk is right beside a window overlooking the road below. If I look down, I can see the crossing.

I saw the lady in black standing there. She was wearing the same black medical mask, but her head was tilted upward, staring directly at the window beside my desk.

When our eyes met, she lifted her hand and waved.

I asked my co-worker Kyle, who sat right beside me, if he saw the woman. His response sent chills down my spine.

“What woman? The crossing is empty.”

He wasn’t joking. On separate occasions, I asked my other co-workers the same question. No one claimed to see her. All of them reacted as if I’d gone crazy, asking why I thought a woman was standing in an empty space.

Shocked, I pulled out my phone and stared at it.

The picture on my phone showed an empty crossing.

I quickly turned my head back to the road below. I still saw her standing there, dressed in black from head to toe, even the mask.

Once again, she waved at me, toward the second floor of the building.

The waving lady didn’t appear in my phone’s picture. Kyle couldn’t see her either.

All day at work, she stayed at the crossing. Every time I turned to look at her and our eyes met, she waved.

When I left the office building that evening, I didn’t see her. I took it as a good sign. But I was wrong.

I hopped on the train as soon as it arrived. I was looking at my phone, scrolling through social media as I walked in and sat down. I didn’t look around.

The moment the train departed, I felt as though someone was staring at me, so I lifted my head.

The train car I was in was empty, except for me...

...and the lady in black.

This time, she wasn’t alone.

There were two other women, wearing exactly the same black dress and black medical mask. They also had the same long, wavy, black hair.

The moment I looked at them, all three turned their heads toward me.

Seconds later, all three of them lifted their hands and waved at me.

Fuck.

I dropped my gaze to the floor, hoping nothing worse would happen.

Then my phone buzzed.

It was Sophia, my other friend at work. She was known for her knowledge of all things spiritual and supernatural.

“Kyle said you saw a woman wearing all black outside the building today? Someone he couldn’t see?” Sophia asked immediately.

“Well, I’m on a train now, and I’m seeing them,” I replied.

“Them?”

“There are three of her now on the train.”

“Are you still looking at them?”

“No, I’m staring at the floor. They’re creepy.”

“Try looking at them now,” Sophia said. “Are there still three?”

“What the fuck,” I muttered. “What do you mean, still three?”

Instinctively, I lifted my head to glance at the strange women in black.

They were still there.

But not three.

There were four of them. They were all staring at me, and then waving at me. At the same time.

Fuck.

“They’re four now,” I whispered in horror. “What the fuck is happening?!”

“Before I explain, Ryan, don’t look away from them,” Sophia warned.

“Why?”

“They increase in number every time you look away and then look back.”

Reflexively, I turned my head again to look at them.

There were five now. Waving at me.

“Sophia, what the fuck is this?!”

“Sisterhood of Death,” Sophia explained calmly. “They are called, intentionally or unintentionally, by the people you’ve murdered throughout your life.”

“Whoa! I’ve never murdered anyone!”

“This doesn’t always mean literally.”

“What do you mean?”

“If you ever treated someone terribly, or bullied someone to the point they killed themselves, it’s considered murder. When they cursed death upon you as they died, they called out to the Sisterhood of Death.”

Immediately, I thought of my high school days—things I’m not proud of.

“The revenge starts the day you turn 25,” Sophia continued. “And I know you just had your 25th birthday five days ago.”

“W-what should I do then?” I stuttered, trembling.

“At some point, they’ll start to multiply until they match the number of people you caused to die,” Sophia replied. “If it’s five, they’ll grow to five before they come to kill you. And it won’t be an easy death. They’ll make you die slowly... painfully.”

I choked.

“Sophia, you have to help me,” I begged.

“How many people have you murdered in the past?” she asked.

“I don’t know, Sophia! I didn’t do it with the intention to kill them!”

“That’s the excuse of all bullies,” Sophia said coldly. “I’ve heard of this happening to more people than I can count. The worst case I knew was someone who had seven. I told them to find their victims’ families and ask for forgiveness. How many women in black are with you now?”

I looked at them and tried to count.

When I had my conversation with Sophia, I completely forgot to keep my eyes on them. Subconsciously, I shifted my gaze from the sisters to my phone or the floor, back and forth. I couldn’t remember how many times that had happened.

I lost count of how many times the sisters had multiplied.

“I don’t know, Sophia,” I said, shivering head to toe. “There are a lot. Twenty... maybe twenty-two...?”

There was silence on Sophia’s end for a few seconds before I heard her voice again.

“You evil lunatic,” she said, her tone flat and expressionless.

Then she hung up.
