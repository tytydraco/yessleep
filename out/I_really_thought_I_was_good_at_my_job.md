It is hard to recall how long ago this story happened; it feels as though it was just yesterday, but also a hundred years ago.  This is the story of a monster, and it all started when my boss had offered me tickets to a local performance at the theater downtown, stating that the agency was investigating an incident at the location.  As I walked into the beautiful location that had accents of 1920’s art deco, I noticed how the architecture felt nostalgically familiar.  The young and costumed worker tore my ticket and allowed me to find my seat, a bit of upholstery foam and a worn red velvet that had seen better days nestled into some rough and unclean plastic that perhaps had not been properly cleaned for at least three years.  I settled in softly.  This piece, written by one of my favorite playwrights, had been performed many times and this was not the first time I had seen it. 

While the show stuck true to the original narrative, I noticed the cast adding extra pieces to the performance.  It added to the already-uncanny vibe of the play.  I had never seen these additions to it before, and I was engrossed in the strange movements of the actors as they sauntered around a stage in a way that I could not have expected.  My hands gripped the sides of my worn seat, my eyes unable to take themselves away from the acrobatics.  It seemed I blacked out.  Passed out, maybe.  Regardless, there is a blank spot between that moment and the end of the show, where the rest of the audience stood and applauded with intense fervor, as though it were the only performance they had seen in their lives.  I woke up feeling as though I had missed something truly amazing.  Something important.  It was hard to remember that I had an assignment.

After the showing, I had decided to spend some time milling about the main lobby area.  It smelled faintly of old popcorn and the carpet had been clearly worn with many performances and audiences.  I noticed the performers were congregating there and spending time with them sounded like a splendid idea.  Actors always seem to have some sense of individuality that is hard to pinpoint outside the theater, but they have always intrigued and endeared me.  At this point, I had almost forgotten what had just happened prior.  I must have just fallen asleep.  This whole show was only a benefit, I reasoned, and a way to complete my next assignment.  But what a benefit it was.  Or at least I thought.

The background actress whom I was supposed to be investigating approached me first, much to my surprise.  The strange post-show theater lighting lit her features in an otherworldly way.  ‘This is just a job,’ I thought as I introduced myself to her and her hungry eyes.  This was not the first time I had seduced a woman, and certainly she did not seem like one to refuse.  My fingers grazed hers lightly, a small shock running up my arm as she did so.  Just electricity.  With just a few kind words, she fell into my arms with a sigh of comfort, and I knew she was mine.  I was so ecstatic with the ease of the situation that I had not even considered the reason it had gone without any struggle.

I put on my best performance of being a kind, innocent, and passionate lover.  Despite not knowing me, she took me into her home without question.  I did not question it either.  She spoke to me of dreams and the future, her coiled tongue spinning false promises like a golden loom.  A home we would inhabit with love and family, ensuring me that every insecurity between us could finally fall away.  The guilt had begun to consume me as her blue eyes nearly hypnotized me.  I could not fail my mission.  But I had never felt love before.  This is what love feels like, right?  At this point I had begun to question the objectives of my mission, as this woman could not possibly be dangerous.  She spent her time helping others with baking and tutoring and other sorts of volunteer work – how dangerous could someone like this possibly be?

I could not forget the task I had been assigned, though.

After a few months, I had begun to start playing out the objectives of my mission.  Once the holidays had begun, it appeared as though she was starting to gain a genuine sense of trust and love for me.  She invited some of her friends to spend the holiday with us in our small home.  I had not made my move yet, but it was clear that the time was just about right.  The more everyone kept drinking, the better the opportunity became.  Her friends were too oblivious to make sense of what was really happening.

There were pangs of guilt, sharp in the back of my skull as I wrapped my large hands around her throat.  She cried out in pain and disbelief, a cry that was not heard by her beloved friends in the other room but muffled by the constriction to her airway.  Loud music made sure that the noises were hidden further.  Since her friends had not heard, it was easy to convince her that she was imagining things.  I truly believed that she believed me, and it was hard to feel terribly guilty when it seemed as though she thought she imagined the entire thing.  She was a better actress than I thought.  I spent nearly a year thinking that I had the power in our relationship.

This year was a year spent in power.  I spent my time doing as I wished, punishing her.  For what, I was not entirely sure – maybe just due to the virtue of being alive.  That was my mission, after all.  Breaking her down into a mere facsimile of who she truly is, all at the behest of an unknown but wealthy benefactor.  The money was too good to pass up - I just was not aware that my target had a mission of her own.

One night, her plan finally came to fruition.  I bent over her, my fingers clutching her neck, angry with her general disrespect and lack of obedience.  There was a tone of purposeful disdain in my voice as I attempted to complete my mission.  “You are nothing.  You are not even worth the force it would take to kill you,” I snarled.  It was then that she changed.  Her face lit up in a way that I had never seen before or since.  The light was not kind.  The light was vengeful.  As though she knew what she was waiting for.  The grin exposed her sharp teeth, and they seemed more dangerous than I had thought.

Her strong jaws gripped my left wrist as I had begun to press it against her throat.  At this point, she knew what I was, and I knew what she was.  I had prepared for this moment.  As she lunged towards my throat, I held up my arms in defense; it did not matter, as she seemed to have more physical strength than I could have ever expected from someone with her small frame.  She quickly overpowered me, and it was clear that my mission had failed.  Her legs straddled my pelvis, her forearm against my throat, as she fed herself upon my blood.  My mission to infiltrate the head of the largest vampire clan on the west coast seems to have failed. 

I felt myself becoming weaker as she drained my blood, her eyes keeping in contact with mine as she absorbed my life force.  Her dilated pupils seemed to absorb every feeling I had, maybe even before I had it.  The intensity in which she looked into my eyes felt like it meant something.  It was not something good.  This was the last time she ever looked at me with any sense of desire.  It certainly was not a desire for my love or affection; however, I do not deserve either.  I wish I had not taken on this mission.

I woke up in the hospital a few weeks later.  She was the only visitor I had, and I knew that it was not with good intention.  I told the hospital staff not to let anyone visit but I am not sure how seriously they had taken that, as I can see her in the corner, in the chair at the leftmost foot of my bed.  I am scared.
