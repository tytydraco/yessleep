It all happened a few days ago, I was cycling home as always when I suddenly heared coughing behind me. I thought nothing of it but then i heard it again, the same coughing. It's cold season where i live so coughing isn't uncommon, but this coughing evolved to something different over time. It was almost like someone was on the cusp of dying.

And then i made the mistake of looking behind me.

There it was, laying on the ground: An almost perfect copy of me. Noone else seemed to notice him. There was something off, well, more off than an exact copy of you on the ground coughing his lungs out. He looked bad, really bad. Almost all his hair had fallen out and his teeth were rotten. His skin was a sickly green and when looking at him you could feel chills all over your body.

I was horrified to say the least.

He started to fade away slowly, like he was decomposing. Only without the flies and rot. You could still see him breathing.

And then, he started screaming, his last breath spent in agony before he disintegrated. Noone else seemed to notice.

The shock was too much, I cycled home filled with dread and unease for what this could mean. I did my normal routine but I was still thinking about the apparition, his deathly screech and the decomposing. I kept quiet through the entire evening and only answered the occasional question with yes or no. I couldn't sleep that night, I kept thinking about him. Until...

And then i woke up. "Damn" I thought "2 AM" and went back to sleep.

And again. "2:40" But this time I had heartburn. "Nothing abnormal" I thought to myself as I took a heartburn tablet. And just when I was about to lay down, I heard it. The screech. But before I could think anything of it, I went back to sleep.

And for a third time, "3:20" But when I woke up, the spectre's bony hands loomed over me, almost touching me. Swiflty avoiding the hand I turned on the lights and wasn't able to sleep for the rest of the night.

The next day i started doing some research, fueled on three and a half hours of sleep and a pitcher of coffee. "College life." I thought as I chuckled to myself. Then I found it, an article describing different cases of Spektertot, first documented in Bavaria in the 1700's by dr. Gerhart Oedenberg. The article described exactly what I saw and had cases of it from all around Germanic Europe, from the southernmost points of Austria to the northen reaches of Svalbard. Anyone could be affected, from young to old.

I had all I needed to know and I went out to get some food. But when I walked past the hallway mirror, I saw it, placing his decomposing hand on my head. I felt myself weaken as soon as i saw it. And I felt it. And my hair started falling out, it was like something from a nightmare, only I was awake. "How?" I thought, as what I tought was a mere hallucination turned out to be real.

I haven't gone outside since, my skin started turning green, as I saw my own name get added to the article. I've started slowly decomposing, but with my last strength I give you this warning: Never look behind you when you hear a sound and you don't know where it comes from.

It's been a wild ride everybody, see you in the afterlife, if I even get there.
