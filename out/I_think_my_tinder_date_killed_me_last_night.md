I know. This sounds impossible. How would I have been killed last night but be posting on Reddit. I get it. But I have no other explanation for what happened this morning. 

I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so bad, I could hardly open my eyes. I realized it was from the blinding, florescent lights over head. I was stiff and cold. That was from the metal slab table I was lying undressed on top of. 

I woke up with a hangover in a morgue. 

I was laid out on an autopsy table with a white, paper sheet covering me. The pathologist wasn’t in the room but the lights were on and next to my table was a rolling tray of various metal instruments that were no doubt about to be used to slice into me. I had a yellow toe tag labeled Doe, Jane. I wasted no time waiting around to see if someone would come back to the room. In the corner by the door, where I assume the pathologists coat was hanging was a plastic bag labeled West Chester Police Department: EVIDENCE with my belongings stuffed inside of it. The clothes I had worn to my date the night before were neatly folded and placed inside. Along with one of my checkered vans, two socks, my black Coach crossbody purse, and my cellphone—which had a new crack through the screen. 

My clothes were absolutely filthy but I redressed myself anyways. I had worn blue jeans and a black sweater—which now were littered with small tears and rips and chalky dirt. My purse had certainly been riffled through. All that was left was a couple of tampons, my go-to lip gloss, and a business card of some girl I had run into downtown ages ago. My wallet and coin purse were gone.

Outside of the autopsy room, the hallway was dark and from the glass doors at the end of the hall, I could see it was still dark out. At this point, I had no idea how much time had passed. All I knew was that I had to get out of there as quick as I could. I hurried down the hall, one dirty sneaker in my hands, padding down the linoleum hallway in just my socks. Just past the examination room on the right was a door that was propped open and warm light was coming from inside. I could hear someone humming softly and the buzz of a microwave warming something fishy. I peeked around the door to see the pathologist with overhead headphones on, air drumming with his back to the door. I took my opportunity and sprinted down the hall and out the front doors. 

The night was cold and drizzly, not at all how the night of my date was. Not to mention that I went out in Lancaster and woke up with my clothes in a West Chester Police Evidence bag. To my absolute surprise, my phone still turned on, albeit smashed to bits. After several seconds of the Apple logo staring back at me, my phone lit up like a Christmas tree with missed calls and texts. Mostly all from my roommate, Bethany. The missed calls started approximately 22 hours prior. 

But, other than the texts from Bethany and a few “You up?” messages from other dating app failures, there was nothing from the guy I had gone out with the night before. I had given him my number and I know I sent him a message when I got to the bar to let him know I had arrived. But they were gone. Inside the Tinder app, I couldn’t find his profile or our messages anywhere. Just a greyed out This User is No Longer Available box that I can’t open. 

I recently started dating after ending a 3 year relationship with my ex, Kyle. I hadn’t done much dating prior to him and thought I’d try my hand at dating apps. I had the basics, hinge, bumble, tinder; even tried my hand at Facebook dating. Most were dead ends. Some ended in an awkward hook up at their cramped studio apartments or sneaking past their roommates door at 2am. I admittedly mostly used Tinder when I was getting antsy and looking for…a short term connection I suppose. 

I couldn’t remember much from who I met up with for my date the night before. I vaguely remember a photo on my screen, a white guy with brown hair. Super specific, I know. I don’t have any memories of seeing him in person either. The last of my memories was me taking a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey sour, and texting the guy I had made it. Next thing I knew I was under a cloth on an autopsy table. 

Now, I’m sure you’re thinking — just look at the screenshots of his profile that you sent to all of your friends! I didn’t take one. In fact, I was avoiding telling anyone I was on the apps or meeting up with strangers. Over the last few months, there’s been several girls in Philadelphia who have showed up dead after meeting up with someone from a dating app. But I’m smart! I carry pepper spray and a taser. I can spot a fake profile from a mile away. And honestly, sometimes I just want a stranger to buy me a drink and call me pretty. So I kept my dating app adventures on the DL. And last night was no different. I told Bethany I was meeting up with a friend and slipped out. She didn’t ask questions and I didn’t give details. And besides, all those girls were hundreds of miles away. If there was a deranged killer on Tinder, I wouldn’t cross paths with him. 

But now, I’m standing in front of the West Chester Medical Examiner’s office with one shoe and I’m pretty sure I’ve just rose from the dead. Bethany answered almost immediately and told me I hadn’t been home in almost 37 hours, give or take. She chalked it up to me hitting it off with someone at a bar and spending the night but she was minutes away from filing a report before I called. She was on the way to the station right then, she had already called and they told her she had to go in person. 

I made it all the way to the bus station before I even thought to consider what I looked like. My voice was horse and dry but I figure if I’ve been dead for a day, probably fits the bill you know. I opened my camera and I literally looked like I rolled out of the morgue. My hair was knotted in the back and had sticky mud in it, I had a busted open wound across the bridge of my nose, and god awful bruising around my neck. 

I was ready to deny this whole deal honestly. I must have gotten roofied and robbed and it was some medical examiners first day on the job. But as I took the bus ride back home, a news alert popped up on my phone.

And you guys, I think it was me. Well, it was supposed to be anyways.
