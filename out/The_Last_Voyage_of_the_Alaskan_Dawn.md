Call me Ike, though that is not my real name. Honestly, with how the last seven weeks have been, I’m not sure if I could ever go back to my real name. The only thing I can say with total certainty is that I am the sole survivor of the Alaskan Dawn. How I found myself on that ship was born through dumb luck and bad decisions. Like a crook doing one last job.



I enlisted in the Marines two years out of high school once I discovered the college wasn’t for me. The late 2010s meant I was going to Afghanistan. It was supposed to be two years active duty and four years in the reserves. It was a good career to supplement me until something I actually wanted to do came around. That was until April 2019, not a full six months into my second year, and an IED went off near my Humvee. I was the gunner, and needless to say, my military career was cut drastically short.



I was thankful to have my limbs, but six inches of steel pierced my hip. Between that and the ravenous concussion, I was sent home early. To this day, I suffer from tinnitus. Took nearly four hours of surgery to remove the steel, but they couldn’t get it all. Some of it was too close to the femoral artery that removing it would probably kill me.



Upon returning home and getting disability, I felt useless. I started drinking heavily. It got to the point that two months before the anniversary of my ‘survival’, I was checked into rehab for alcohol abuse. With COVID, and my chances of getting a real job already low, I went back to the booze. When the world started back up, I was forced back into rehab. That seemed to stick, and I’ve been sober ever since.



So naturally, I replaced alcohol with gambling.



Vice 2 wasn’t as easily forgiven. No help from my parents, and I can’t blame them. When I was 22 and struggling, they wanted to nurse their baby boy. But at 27, they weren’t about the shill out thousands more to fix a different problem. Can’t say I blame them, I didn’t have a job, and all of my disability checks were hitting Fan Duel faster than any real bill I had.



It got to the point where I was banned from Foxwoods for not paying back my debt.



It took me realizing that I would be out of money the same week that my check came in, that maybe it was time to find a job. That was also a problem. Personality-wise, I didn’t want to hump a desk 9-5, but most other jobs required me to stand for hours at a time, which was terrible on my hip.



Next best chance, next to Indeed, was Craigslist. I ignored all the ones that were asking for hitman services; those were all police plants wanting to nab a spouse wanting to whack their significant other. There were a couple other security ads, and then I stumbled on this one.



Security needed for Boat Voyage. Ex-service members only. Pays cash. Seemed simple enough. The description was even more convincing. Easy money and a one-time gig. Pays handsomely. Looking for people willing to spend up to three weeks offshore. Once complete, you will be paid and communications will cease.



At this point, I saw no red flags.



Well, no red flags that turned me off. It was a mysterious person online, and for all I knew, I was signing up for gladiator fights on a cruise, but I had no money in either my checking or savings account, so I was beyond desperate. If for nothing else, I would feel like I was contributing.



I emailed an inquiry. Something simple: how much?



The reply was quick from a clear burner email address, a random assortment of letters and numbers: 2,000 per day. Food and other supplies will be provided. Any other questions?



I emailed back: what is the job?



The reply was quick and unnerving: I see you are from the New Haven, Connecticut region. I can meet you at the pizzeria on State Street, if you’re interested.



My heart sank at the knowledge of my address. I’m sure it was light work for a computer guy to trace an IP, but in no way did I feel any better. However, my math skills dulled my anxiety; 2k a day meant at most I was looking at 28k. A nice nest egg to be back on my feet. Maybe help me get a long-term job.



I simply replied I’m interested.



The pizzeria was crowded. I had two slices and a Coke; I focused on the parking lot. I wanted to see if I could spot the mystery man.



“That’s gonna get cold,” said the man who sat across from me. He had a narrow face. His glasses rested on the bridge of his nose. He wore a Yale street and jeans, looking almost too casual for this.



“How did-”



“C’mon, you’ve been watching the parking lot like a hawk. And you didn’t even touch your pizza,” said the man.



I shrugged and took a pizza. There was still some heat in there.



The man tapped his finger.



“Yeah?” I said with a mouth full of pizza.



“You emailed me, remember. Thought you wanted details.”



I swallowed and moved my plate aside. The man adjusted in his seat.



“My employer is looking for former servicemen; I can assume you are one.”



“Marines.”  



The man nodded. I felt him studying me like this interaction was a trial run. I leaned back and relaxed my shoulders.



“Good. The job is simple. There is a charter based out of California, it leaves in two days. Flight and the two-day stay at a hotel will be covered. Firearms will be provided for you.”



“Firearms, huh?”



“You don’t think we were selecting veterans for modeling, did you?”



I smirked.



“Is this offensive or defensive?”



“You and the others will be doing basic security. Just need to be careful of the cargo.”



“What are we moving?”



“Nothing of your concern. In fact, that’s the perfect segue into the three main rules.”



I took a sip of my Coke.



“Let’s hear them.”



“One, no names. Pick a call sign before you fly out. Two, no questions. If my employer or any of his delegates tells you to do something, you jump to it. And the final one is the difficult one.”



I waved him on; the pizza was calling my name.



“Should the ship sink or in any way fall into peril, you will not issue any form of SOS or Mayday.”



And there it was. The catch. No rescue. Success or death. Not quite the best option. But 28k was a lot of money for someone with none.



“Okay, I’m in.”



The man shook his head.



“Your driver’s license, please.”



“Excuse me?”



“C’mon, the no names is for you guys. I need it to verify if you fit our criteria.”



“Can you do that in two days?”



“It won’t take us two hours.” The man winked.



I scoffed. I took out my wallet, removed the license, and slid it across the table. The man looked and took a picture of it with his phone. He handed it back.



“Good to meet you. You’ll hear back soon.”



And I did. I went home, opened my laptop, and started to pace. After all, I had no money for rent, food, anything. If I got the job, I could negotiate with my landlord. Keep my head afloat until I got something more consistent. Three emails hit in rapid succession. The first was from a clear burner email.



Four words: You’re in. Pack light.



The second was my bank: $1,000 was deposited into my checking account.



The final was from Expedia: my flight to Santa Barbara and Marriott stay were booked and paid for.



For the first time in a while, I felt good.



It lasted until I got into the car at SBA. The flight was fine, barring some turbulence, but the car ride was unsettling. I was picked up by two big guys in suits; the bulges in their jackets were from shoulder holsters. They wore scarves to cover their faces. The worst part was that they were overly professional, opening the door, taking my bag.



While my scary valet pulled away, I watched the city move out the window. When I checked in, I was given a bag, said to have been left for me. When I opened it, there was a Visa gift card and a note.



This will cover your food until you board.



I spent the first day mostly in bed. I ordered a pizza around eight just to have something. California pizza sucked, but I wanted something cheap that delivered. Payment went through fine. I grabbed a soda from the vending machine and enjoyed some YouTube while I ate cardboard pizza with flat Sprite.



The next morning, I got the complimentary breakfast. As I looked for a seat, I was waved over. The guy was medium high but built. He was tan and had a surfer dude haircut.



“Thanks,” I said.



“You here for the mystery gig?” he said.



“What makes you say that?”



The guy laughed. He smacked the table, nearly spilling his tea.



“C’mon, you got bags under your arms, built strong, and you flew in on the same flight I did.”



“I didn’t see you,” I said.



“I was incognito,” he lifted his hands and enacted faux dodges.



“Charger,” he said, extending his hand. I forgot about the nicknames. So I panicked.



“Ike.”



Charger nodded and went back to breakfast. As we ate, we discussed, vaguely, about ourselves. Charger was a SoCal native; he was a Marine Scout Sniper for a few years and found the lack of work that matched that excitement. He took this job because it seemed fun. Can’t say I didn’t agree.



The only negative to Charger was his nickname; he chose it because of his favorite football team. As a Chiefs fan, it was hard for me to associate with a fan of a division rival, but hey, at least he wasn’t a Raiders fan.



“So did you hear any of the rumors?” asked Charger.



“Uh, no, I haven’t spoken to any about this aside from you and the guy who hired me.”



Charger downed his tea; his gulps rang out like church bells.



“From what I heard, this guy is some big shot in the pharmaceutical world, got caught up in some experimental shit.”



“Or maybe we’re protecting some rare earth metal being shipped overseas.”



Charger shrugged. I sipped my coffee. There was a nagging voice in my head telling me to finish breakfast, get an Uber, and promptly fuck off. I had that grand from glasses man, I could swing it. Fly back to New England and maybe try a desk job.



But my curiosity and determination outweighed any fear.



After breakfast, I went to my room and found another envelope. It had my name and full address on it. I opened it, and it was a contract. It was an NDA and the three rules on listed, each requiring an initial.



I will under no circumstances radio a Mayday or an SOS was seared into my mind.



I signed it. Selling your soul was easier than one might think. On the back of the envelope, I was told to put the contract inside and hand it to my driver.



At 2:30, we were checked out. The car took Charger and me from the hotel to the Port of Hueneme. The ride was quick; there wasn’t enough time to think or second-guess ourselves. When I stepped out of the car, my eyes were drawn to the USS Alaskan Dawn. It was a tanker ship, about 600 feet long. What caught my eye was a huge metal structure, about 50 feet tall and wide. I chalked it up to specialty cargo, but it was strange. Most cargo ships utilized the hull space; this seemed to be for a different purpose.



“Three-week sausage party, hope someone brought Vaseline,” whispered Charger to me. I smirked, but I doubted anyone wanted action on the seven seas.  His joke snapped me out of my questions. I reminded myself about the 28k.



And how I wasn’t supposed to ask questions.



There were about 12 of us. We checked in with our callsign and boarded.



On deck, there was a group of men in polos and trousers. Most of us were in khaki shorts, graphic tees, and the occasional ball cap. One guy was wearing a Pink Floyd shirt, which I appreciated. Another was wearing a shirt with Dante from Clerks saying, “I’m not even supposed to be here today.” I couldn’t talk shit, I was wearing an old Alex Smith jersey and camo shorts.



A tall man with thin grey hair walked passed the better-dressed men and turned to face. He was slightly underweight, and his skin wrinkled. He stood hunched. He cleared his throat.



“Greetings, gentlemen, for the sake of personal anonymity, call me Dr. Purple. This is my charter. My vessel. Now, we have received your signatures and NDAs. Henceforth, nothing on this ship happened. Your duties here are to ensure the safety of myself and my team over the next three weeks or so. As discussed before, each day will ensure you a lump sum. If any issues arise, my number 2, Mr. Nantucket, will see to your needs.”



He stepped aside, and Mr. Nantucket, a built man with bright red hair, stood forward.



“I’ll show you around.”



We followed him inside. He showed us the stairs to the bridge. In terms of active patrol, we were expected to rotate in 12-hour shifts. When not on, we could use the recreational room. There was a foosball table, a dartboard, and various board games next to the barracks.  Near the barracks and the hull were weapons cases. Rifles and ammo were stashed there. Food was at 8AM, 2PM, and 8PM with a few vending machines around. All seemed fine.



Along with Charger, I made friends with the two others we bunked with, Jules, a young Black man from Jersey City, and Poacher, a Hispanic guy from Chicago. Jules was in the National Guard, but this was a chance for extra money. Poacher was ex-Special Forces; he didn’t elaborate on which unit he was in. No one asked.



The first couple of days were simple. Jules and Poacher took the mornings. Charger and I took the nights. We usually stood topside and watched the water. By the end of the first night, we were miles from shore.



There was no one left to save us.



Night on the Alaskan Dawn was peacefully terrifying. There was no light on the water once the clouds were down. Aside from the overhead lights, there was nothing to be seen.



Charger and I were on deck patrol one night. There was always a moment, mid-patrol, where we stopped and just looked into the void, between a black sky and a dark sea. Usually, this was when Charger would strike up a cigarette.



“Who do you favor this season?” he asked.



“The Chiefs, duh.”



“I mean, yeah, but after that Super Bowl-”



“Don’t fucking go there, bolt boy.”



We took a beat to laugh, but in that silence, we realized something.



The engines were cut.



We stood and listened. There was no commotion. We willingly stopped. It was three days of travel, and now, we were at a standstill. From this height, we could still hear the waves splashing against the side of the ship.



“I don’t like this,” I said.



“Yeah.”



The rest of that night was uneventful. As was the night after that.



I don’t remember what day it was when Jules woke me up at around 11.



“What?” I snapped.



“Sorry, Ike, we need you and Charger on deck. Two of our morning crew are sick.”



I rolled out of bed and didn’t bother to fix my hair. I smacked Charger’s arm, which dangled over my bunk.



Thankfully, lunch was in an hour, so I could grab some grub before pulling a double shift.



“Make sure those assholes know they owe us one,” I said. Jules waved me off as he went topside.



I headed to the bridge to check the cameras. While it was part of my job, I never got to see the hull during the day. Especially what was going on in the big box.



The main camera guy was Bobcat; he was a good ole' boy from Arkansas. Spoke with the twang to boot.



“Mornin’, Ike, takin’ over for the two sickos?” said Bobcat.



“Yeah, coffee up here any good?”



“You know we ain’t supposed to ask no questions.”



“I thought that only applied to Dr. Purple’s people eaters.”



He chortled at that.



“I know, I know, I’m fuckin’ with you, Ike.”



I poured myself a coffee and drank it black. I peered over the camera and saw a glass box. Dr. Purple and two assistants were in the box. They were doing electrical work or something. All I saw were sparks. The camera wasn’t great.



“They synthesizing somethin’,” Bobcat said. He leaned back in his chair, allowing me a better view. Eventually, the white fuzzy silhouettes of Purple and Co. moved, and there lay a thin body. The thing was still. I couldn’t see any discernible features. I’d have written the thing off if I couldn’t see it breathing.



“Holy shit, Bob, you seeing this?” I asked.



“Seeing what?”



I watched as I saw little nubs start to sprout. I couldn’t hear a thing, but it was clear that it was struggling. The top of the thing began to pop and grow. The ‘head’ extended into becoming a lizard-like skull structure. Flesh ripped away as it went from blank to developed. A long tongue slid out and circled the air. My heart raced.



Pharmaceutical my ass, this was some John Hammond experimentation.



No laws on genetic testing in international waters.



We weren’t protection, we were containment.



The animal grew legs quick, they were thick. The arms were still small, like what a T-Rex’s arms would look like. The head smashed into the glass. Then again. And again. I couldn’t see it, but the thing cracked the glass.



The fourth smash caused the glass to shatter and collapse. My heart raced as that thing stepped out of the container. It beat so hard I could feel it in my ears.



An alarm blared. Lights flashed in the hull. CONTAINMENT BREACH! CONTAINMENT BREACH!



The scream carried across the ship. Bobcat and I stared in disbelief.



“Help me find the door seals,” he said.



We frantically searched the control panel. As we looked, the cameras picked up on the thing moving down a corridor. We heard the gunshots.



And the screams.



I finally found it and turned the key. The echo of doors closing in the hull rung out. I fell to the ground to catch my breath.



“What the fuck was that!” yelled Bobcat.



“I don’t know.”



We made our way down. Dr. Purple was MIA, Nantucket was around the survivors. Three of our security guys were gone. Poacher clutched his arm. I didn’t have to get a close look to see that it was gone below the bicep.



“I need everyone to calm down,” said Nantucket, his New England accent bleeding through.



“Fuck that! What is that?” yelled Poacher. He winced.



“That thing was simply procedural; you have nothing to worry about.”



“Bullshit.” Someone yelled.



“Fuck that.” Yelled another. Nantucket was sweating. He probably didn’t know what he had gotten himself into.



“We, uh, we locked the doors,” said Bobcat.



“The hull seals?” asked Nantucket. He nodded. I stood behind and watched. Nantucket rubbed his stubble. He took a deep breath.



“Okay, I’m not sure how this is going to work, but we need to isolate the thing and make sure it’s dead.”



“It’s sealed off, ain’t that enough?” chimed in Jules.



“No, I, I don’t know.” He walked over to the railing and hurled. He sighed and came back.



“Right now, Dr. Purple is the only one MIA. If you want to go back for the bodies of the dead, I won’t stop you. The hull is sealed off, but I don’t know if that will hold.”



Commotion and debate arose among the survivors.



“Do we have walkies?” I finally said.



Nantucket and the others looked at me.



“A few, mainly for the scientists, but what’s up?” he asked.



“Give me one. We’ll take a few guys in and see what we can do about this thing. Bobcat will take one and be our eyes in the hull.”



“Okay,” said Nantucket.



“I’ll take one too,” said Charger. He stood up.



“Let’s get you boys armed,” said Nantucket. I took the lead, along with me were Charger, Jules, and two other grunts I knew, Frazier and Dante, who still wore his Clerks shirt. It would be enough of a ragtag group to hopefully stop the madness.



Nantucket opened the locker. There were three radios. I took one, so did Charger. We each took a Daniel Defense AR with a 10-round magazine.



Fucking California Compliance.



Illegal experiments at sea were fine, but god-forbid we piss off the ATF.



We each took four mags each. At least carrying 10 rounds was easier than carrying four 30-round mags. I took a Sig Sauer as a sidearm. If I were getting mauled, I was going down swinging. Nantucket passed out flashlights.



“Good luck,” he said.



“Whoever bags it gets a bonus, right?”



“Ask me, you get bonuses for going down there,” said Nantucket. He turned and walked up the stairs. I held the rifle close and waited for Bobcat to chime in.



With a static and crack, I heard him.



“Alright, I’m in.”



I raised my thumb up to a camera.



“Can you see me?”



“Aye, aye, Ike.”



I took a deep breath. This was just another patrol. That’s all.



I spun open the door, and we started walking through. We turned the flashlights on and started our way down the hall.



“IKE, GUYS, BEHIND YOU!”



I turned around. Crawling from the roof and wrapping around the door was the thing. In 20 minutes, it had grown from about 2 feet long to 5 feet tall. It had full arms and could climb. Its pale skin was now steel grey.



It could camouflage.



We raised our rifles and fired. It was deafening. The beast slid down and Frazier by his ankle. He yanked him down with such force that his leg popped clean off. He screamed. It was more deafening than the rifle shots.



The thing lifted its head and burrowed its big jaws into the man’s chest.



Charger fired at the thing’s skull. It only stopped when a round struck it in the eye. It bled from where its eyes used to be. It didn’t roar or react; instead, it grabbed the carcass with its free hand and scurried into the darkness.  



“Anyone else hurt?” asked Charger. I dropped my magazine and reloaded.



“I’m good,” said Jules.



“Me, me too,” said the other. 



I took a deep breath.



We turned on our flashlights and held them close. The only way to the beast was to keep going.



As we reached the end of the hall, the fluorescent lights nearly blinded us when we got in. This was the big box. The sides were reinforced with titanium. The glass cage was shattered. Blood streaked across the floor. One of the scientists lay decapitated, his head nastily bitten off. The whole area reeked of rotting flesh. We searched high and low. Glass shattered under our boots.



“Holy shit!” yelled Jules. We rushed his position. He found a biohazard bin. Inside were easily a dozen, probably more, of the ‘base’. The white thin object was meant to become the specimen. At the top were the ones that got closest. Some had half-formed faces, others limbs. One had half a leg. They all stunk of decay.



“I’m gonna be sick,” said Charger. He found an empty bin and hurled.



The sound of metal crunching came from one of the side halls.



“Jules, with me, you two, stay and see if anyone else here survived.”



I took the lead. Jules was close behind.



“I shoulda never taken this job,” he said. His hands were shaking.



“Neither should I,” I said with a smile. It was fake. My nerves were fried, and my hip was hurting. I had to fight through. Can’t take charge and crap out.



I stopped in front of what seemed like the tail. That thing grew quick. It wasn’t even an hour, and it had an additional limb. I looked up to trace the beast, see if I could see underneath it. That’s when it shook and pulled up.



That wasn’t a tail.



That was its arm.



The top floor of the deck was collapsing.



“Go, go, go, go, go!” I yelled. Jules didn’t take much convincing. We turned around as the deck above us came tumbling down. The door felt like miles away. I dove, losing my rifle, but I landed.



I turned, expecting Jules right behind me.



But he wasn’t.



“Ike, I’m almost there!” I watched him jump forward. I reached out to grab him. Our arms locked fast and firm. That’s when four long grey claws came from the darkness and snatched his torso.



He screamed, and blood squirted from his mouth. With a crunch, we all knew his ribs were broken.



I dropped to the ground with his arms in mine. Charger grabbed his arms, and Dante fired into the darkness.



“Please, don’t let me die like that,” Jules groaned.



“I won’t kid, hang on,” I said.



A single gunshot rang out, causing Charger and me to drop him. In that split second, we only saw where the bullet went into Jules’ head.



The beast roared and dragged Jules into the depths of the boat.



Behind us was Dr. Purple with my Sig Sauer in his hand.  



“You piece of shit!” I yelled. Charger didn’t hesitate; he shot the doctor in the stomach. The doctor fell to the ground. I grabbed the handgun off the floor and tucked it into my waistband.



“Do you know what you’ve done?” choked the doctor.



“I don’t give a fuck,” said Charger. He walked away.



“What is that thing?” I asked. The doctor shook his head.



“You killed me. That means no payment for any of you. That man was a goner; once he was in the claws, he was dead.”              



“Man? He was 19!”



The doctor said nothing. I dropped my boot onto his knee. He recoiled in pain. I got in close.



“What is that thing?”



“It’s a success, that’s what it is.”



I pressed down hard.



“No games, what the fuck is that!?”



“It’s an amalgamation. I wanted to see how certain DNAs interacted and what they formed. This one seemed to be the most compatible.”



“What DNA!”



“Doesn’t matter. I’m dead anyway.”



I punched the wound. He jolted and spat blood.



“Takes a long time to bleed out from a gut shot, Doc.”



He shook his head. His lips were already drying out.



“The base is Monitor lizard, then we started adding. Various species of venomous fish, like the Cuttlefish, squid, we even tried whale.”



“What the fuck is in that one?” I asked less curious and more panicked.



“Monitor, Humboldt Squid, Cuttlefish, Rhinoceros, Sperm Whale, and Human.”



“You put human DNA in there!”



“Had plenty of it,” he said with a sickening grin.



Then I realized something, part whale, it could hear us.



With a loud bang, the ship shook. The thing was still growing. It was still trying to kill everything onboard.  



“Let’s move,” I said.



“What about him?” asked Dante. I watched as the creature’s back broke through the floor. It’s ugly, regrown eye, which was still covered by a thin layer of skin, peered from the crack.



“Leave him.” No one argued as we turned around and left the lab.



Dr. Purple’s screams followed us until a loud squelch silenced them. 



I radioed Bobcat down. When we got topside, the few survivors stood in a semi-circle. Poacher died; white foam poured from his agape mouth. The toxins from the beast infected the wound and killed him quickly.



There weren’t many of us left. Killing this thing was the only option.



Charger explained the situation as best he could. Once he was done, Nantucket pulled me aside.



“If everything you said is true, sinking the ship might be our best bet.”



“Are you fucking crazy? Sink the ship.”



“We have lifeboats. We can escape. Get far enough away and send out the SOS.”



“So much for the no SOS clause.”



“Lennard, Purple is dead; there is no sense in preserving this.”



The slip was fatal. Lennard had to be Doctor Curtis Lennard from Johns Hopkins. I didn’t read much science stuff, but he made a big name for himself during the pandemic. Mainly for his work on rDNA vaccines. He understood the science well. Of course, three years after the pandemic and dozens of conspiracy theories later, he was kicked out of Hopkins and practically blacklisted for ejecting cancer patients with lobster DNA to see how it would help treatment.



Spoiler alert: it made them sick.



Medical genius or mad scientist didn’t seem that far apart.



“How did you end up here, working for him?” I asked.



Nantucket smirked.



“Opioid addiction makes you do crazy things. I needed money for pills or rehab, whichever seems right after this.”



“Makes you feel any better, I took it to fix my gambling debts.”



“Well, I hope we make it to enjoy healthier lifestyles.”



I nodded. Nantucket took a deep breath and walked in front of the survivors.



“Okay, here’s the plan. Ike, Charger, and I will go to the engine room; we’ll overcharge the engine and detonate the ship. That will cause the ship to sink fast and cause a vortex. That thing will likely be unable to escape the ship when that happens. Doctor Anastasia will lead the rest of you to the lifeboats. Each of you take a walkie so we can communicate. From there, we’ll deploy the SOS.”



Everyone nodded.



Everyone understood.



The three was us went down into the catacombs of the Alaskan Dawn.



We kept the flashlights on; there were no lights down there. The hallways felt tight. The foul stench of abomination whiffed through the halls. It got to the point where Nantucket covered his mouth with a cloth. The metal creaked.



Then snapped.



A large column slammed around them. It was the thing's leg. I looked up the hole and saw the torso. The tail went down and entire hallway.



“Run,” I said.  



Our steps began to echo, and that’s when the beast turned around above us. The metal churned as it lifted its leg and maneuvered its way behind us. As we sprinted, it gained on us. The rot from its breath stained the back of our shirts. Its jaws snapped at them. Stopping to shoot wasn’t an option.



“We’re almost there!” yelled Nantucket.



I thought we were far enough from the snapping jaws.



Eventually, it got one of us.



Charger.



His death was quick, one snap, and he was folded in half. It was down the beast’s throat before I could react.



Nantucket held the door so I could get in and then slammed it. The beast rammed into the door, but it could not break it down. As I gasped for air, I heard it retreat. Nantucket had the plan; he started opening up valves and letting gas out.



“Ike, you should go,” he said, flatly.



“What, why?” I asked.



“Only one of us needs to be here for this to go off, and” his voice trailed off. He took a deep breath.



“Before I took this job, I was in jail. Held because I accidentally ran my son over while I was high. He’ll never walk again because of my actions. I don’t deserve a second chance. If you get out, you deserve one. Good luck.”



I said nothing in the argument. I patted him on the back and walked out. I heard the door slam behind me, and I started to ascend from the depths.



I found a lifeboat and boarded it solo. The others already were in the water, floating nearby. I managed to start the boat up and head out.



“Ike, Ike, you okay?” asked Bobcat.



“Copy Bobcat.”



From our lifeboats, we saw the top of the Alaskan Dawn peel back. The beast burst out of the top of the ship. Its upper body was huge. The thickness of his body showed, and its skin was a light bluish grey color. One eye was black and the other, the one Charger shot out, was yellow. One arm snuck out of the hull and snaked like a tentacle.



It grabbed the other lifeboat and squeezed tight. The windows blew out. I heard gunfire come from the boat as it was lifted.



Then the explosion erupted. Fire came out of the rear of the ship. I ducked as shrapnel ripped across the ocean. Metal ripped through the top of my lifeboat.



The Alaskan Dawn started to capsize. Within minutes, the ship, the beast, and the survivors were underwater.



Nantucket was right; the vortex almost instantly and pulled everything under water.



When the ocean was still, I started attempting an SOS.



I was out on the ocean for at least a week. It took a Japanese fishing ship to find me. They brought me back to the country. It took me about two months to recover, and thank god for the Japanese healthcare system being free. My doctor, Tsuneo Miyamoto, told me that if I had been out there for another day, I likely wouldn’t have been able to be saved.



While I recovered, a Navy Master-at-Arms came to my room and gave me a light interrogation as to what the hell I was doing on a lifeboat, alone, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I lied, I don’t even remember if my lie was convincing. Truth is, I don’t know what Lennard’s plan was; for all I know, it could’ve been a government contract. All I knew was that whatever that science was, it was best left at the bottom of the ocean.
