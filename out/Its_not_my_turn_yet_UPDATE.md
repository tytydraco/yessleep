This wont make sense to you if you havent read my first entry: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lt95kj/tape\_2\_your\_turn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lt95kj/tape_2_your_turn/)



  
It has been over twenty-four hours since I posted my last message. I should be dead or at least gone by now. That is what I expected. The night that followed was thick with silence so heavy it pressed against my chest, making it hard to breathe. Yet somehow, I am still here. Still breathing, still trapped. That is not a blessing. It is a curse. Because surviving this long does not mean I have escaped. It means I have become part of something far worse—something that refuses to let go.

The tape labeled “FINAL” is not simply a video. It is a key. The moment I pressed play, the basement appeared on the screen, but it was distorted. The chair was empty. No man bound to it, no crawling thing writhing nearby. Instead, the camera moved of its own accord—gliding with unnatural ease, spinning in impossible angles, like a living eye that sees everything but cannot be seen. The walls bled shadows, long and writhing, stretching toward the camera as if desperate to escape the confines of the tape. Then came the voice. Whispered at first, barely audible, like a breath across my ear. Slowly it grew louder, filling the room until it echoed through every corner, every crack in the walls. The voice hissed, “**You are not done**.” Those words have been ringing in my mind since, a dreadful echo that refuses to fade.

Since then, the house has transformed. It no longer feels like a home. The floors creak and groan in strange, deliberate patterns. Sometimes it sounds like tapping, sometimes scraping, always close—always just out of reach. It feels as if the house itself is alive, breathing, watching. Mirrors no longer reflect me. Instead, the man from the tape stares back with wide, terrified eyes. His face is pale and drawn, silent but screaming in ways that words cannot describe. I catch glimpses of the crawling thing at the edges of my vision—its elongated limbs moving with unnatural speed and grace. But when I turn to face it, it vanishes, leaving only a cold void and the faintest trace of decay in the air.

The plastic chair in the basement is no longer just a chair. It is a shrine to something dark. Fresh scratches cover it now—symbols carved deep into the plastic. I do not know their meaning, but I feel them like burns on my skin every time I look. Underneath the chair, I found a note. It was not written with pen or pencil. The words were burned into the paper, like a brand, jagged and cruel. It read: “You are the next watcher. Do not blink.” I have no idea what being a watcher means, but the phrase haunts me like a curse whispered by something ancient and merciless.

I have tried to leave. I have packed bags, opened the door, stepped outside. But every path I take bends back to the house. The woods surrounding it seem to shift and close in, branches like fingers scraping at my clothes, pulling me back. My phone is useless. Calls do not connect. Instead, I am met with static and faint whispers—voices speaking in a language I cannot understand but that chills me to the bone. At night, the scratching and crawling noises grow louder. They come from beneath the floorboards, moving closer, waiting.

Sleep is a distant memory. When I do manage to drift off, the man from the tape appears in my dreams. No longer bound, he walks beside me through endless, dark corridors filled with those same pulsing shadows. He speaks in riddles, fragments I cannot remember upon waking, but I know they are warnings. Warnings I am too afraid to understand. I wake up gasping, drenched in sweat, with the echo of his wide, pleading eyes burned into my mind.

I am caught between watching and being watched. Between this world and whatever lies beyond the static and shadows. I do not know if I am meant to fight or to surrender. All I know is that the house has claimed a part of me. It whispers to me in the silence, waiting. Waiting for the moment I will finally become like the man in the tape. Tied to the chair, silent and wide-eyed, waiting for the next person to press play and hear the words: “Your turn.”

And yet, I am still here. Still breathing. Still watching. Something inside me fights to hold on, to resist. But the fight is fading. My eyes are tired. I blink less and less, afraid that when I do, I will lose what is left of myself.

If this is my last message, remember this: I did not choose to stay. Something is tethering me here, something older than fear itself. It knows I am still watching. And it knows I am afraid to blink.
