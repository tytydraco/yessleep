Since a few years back I’ve been at random times forced into suffocating silence, but just because I can’t hear anything doesn’t mean it can’t hear me.

Due to recent advents I now know other people are experiencing this strange world I call the further, named after that alternate universe in insidious.

At first I believed I was the only one who was able to enter the further but now I know that just most the people who can didn’t make it past their first visit,

So lucky for you guys you get to get a guide from me a 18 year old comic book guy, honestly if you have anyone to thank for this information it would be my brother his collection of fancy knives, they saved my butt on 3 seperate occasions.

Rule 1 never make a sound during one of these visits except to confirm you’re in the further, most people will try to get their families or friends attention eventually resorting to yelling.

This is suicide and also what I did the first time it happened, I was 16 at the time my brother and I where sitting on are phones ignoring each other until I suddenly couldn’t hear the sound from my phone.

I first thought it was the bluetooth but when I realised it was connected and nothing else was making a noise I tapped my headphone which was still in my ear but to my surprise their wasn’t the familiar thud of the headphone going deeper into my ear.

At thirst I thought I was deaf but them I started talking and realised I could hear myself but nothing else, after some experimentation I learned I could only hear the noises I made and other people trapped in this world.

At the time I was confused and tried to get my brothers attention leading to one of grabbers as I call them to well grab me, these things are like skeleton arms with ears on their palm of their hands, these creatures can appear anywhere dark but are extremely sensitive to light.

That and their ears being damaged by ether a weapon in this case my brothers replica of the knife used in Rambo or a extremely loud sound, this is last resort thanks to rule 2.

 Rule 2 unless you want to be thrown out a window at luckiest or slowly have your vocal cords removed at worst then find somewhere to hide asap.

Don’t worry if grabbers where in the hiding spot before once you hurt their ears with the noise they will go back to whatever hell they came from, my best places to hide from these things is under a bed or table, these things can’t bend down which is why it flipped me out the window because my throat was out of reach.

I call these monsters Larrys because of their resemblance to the monster named Larry from a cheesy horror movie me and my friends watched.

After the first incident happened a started keeping notes on things to test out if I end up there again and how to avoid any creatures that I encountered which eventually became this list.

After a few weeks I thought my first one of these events was just a one time cosmic glitch in the matrix which it would’ve been if it hadn’t spotted me which bring us to rule 3 don’t piss off the mime.

This thing scares the ever loving shit out of me but seems to have no ill intent towards me and no way to get rid of it and it is the thing that keeps bringing me back here.

It seems to latch onto a person and bring them back again and again just to be around them, but creating these rips in the universe also has the side effect of bringing other people in which is what happened a few months ago.

The usual weird stuff happens when one of the events happen where everything went silent and the mine showed up and began sitting with me, by this point I had decided to use the further as way to get in some exercise because of the funny thing it does to time.

So while I was out jogging making sure to be quite with the mine walking along with me, when I heard something, it was a gasp. I darted around to see someone else who was somehow in the further, I turned around to see a girl a few years older then me a school teacher I recognised who had seen me first and came up when she saw me look at the mine.

She had intended to get me a way from the mine not knowing it wasn’t hostile, at least it wasn’t to me as soon as she grabbed me and started to run the mime completely changed his attitude the joyous grin replaced with anger.

I hadn’t been this scared of the mime since I had first discovered it on my second trip, as I was being lead away by the teachers arm she screamed and her hand loosed it’s grip falling from my arm.

Her severed hand hitting the floor with a wet thud I turned to the mime who was miming having a chainsaw, she then fell to the floor sobbing and whaling uncontrollably as a stood there like an idiot as the mime approach the woman who had risked her life to save me.

Then the mime walked towards me and mimed their being a box around me which when I tried to run was their I was trapped forced to watch the woman’s vocal cords be ripped out by Larry before she bled out of the street.

Rule 4 don’t go into malls or clothes shops, this is a pretty simple one and requires little explanation of why it exist, as the clothes dummies are alive and will try to make you scream to get Larry to come and rip out your vocal cords so they can easily take out your inside parts and make them your outside parts while using your lifeless husk as a skin suit.

I could tell you how I now this and it’s because if you go into a mall of clothes store not only will the dummies come to live but so will the shoppers being pulled into the further only to die and have their lives stolen.

It was a while before I could bring my self to go out again after that, but eventually I did and I learned another a horror that I was completely oblivious to, the dogs who meow.

 Rule 5 stay away from them don’t pet them don’t feed them don’t interact with them in anyway, If you do your acknowledge their existence it will be enough to bring them into the normal world, which is not something you want to happen but if it does scream it’ll be quicker that way, I only survived my encounter with them thanks to the mime.

Rule 6 don’t trust anyone you meet in the further, most of them aren’t people and only a few of the ones that are aren’t trying to sacrifice you to a god or something or are dumb and don’t know what their doing and unless you both want to be in a earlier grave I recommended you run from anyone you see.

Rule 7 if you see a watch or calendar that isn’t the time you entered the further walk back to where you were before it’s too late, for this reason is why I keep a watch on my person that shows both the date and time and check it frequently if anything moves on the watch I’ll usually head home and weight to get back.

Rule 8, don’t do any messed up crap like murder or anything like that because the people that die here don’t leave and will be waiting when you come back, and you will be coming back.

Fell free to do whatever else while you wait for the universe you know to let you back in, personality my favourite pass time has been trying all the different flavours of ice cream at McDonald’s, yes before you ask the machine works in the further.
