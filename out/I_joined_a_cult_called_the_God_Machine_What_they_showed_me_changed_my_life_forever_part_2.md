“For the cause, this man gave his life,” Dax said, motioning down to the corpse. “He died for the highest purpose imaginable. To connect human and divine is the goal. If we can succeed, we will save billions from death- this eternal cycle of annihilation.”

A few of the cult members had tears in their eyes, but the rest had emotionless, vacant expressions on their faces. “And like all of us, in the end, we will give the human shell to the Angel of Death, so that the Angel may pass over us and leave us in peace for another night.” Dax turned to a young brunette to his right. “Have you called the High Priest in yet?” She nodded.

“Archon is on his way,” she said haughtily. At that moment, an extremely tall man walked in through the door, one that I had never seen before. He had on a silken, silver-colored robe that seemed to grab light from the room as he walked, causing it to shimmer all around him. But it was his face that was most memorable. I involuntarily breathed in a gasp as I looked at him.

He had multiple surgical modifications to his face and mouth. His lips had been split down the middle, healing so that small flaps of skin hung separated beneath his nose. He opened his mouth to greet Dax, and I saw his tongue was also cut, looking like the tongue of a snake. All of his teeth had been ground down to vampiric points and covered in silver. As if reading my mind, Dax turned to look at me, smiling broadly.

“Archon, this is one of our newest members, Joe Larson,” he said, motioning to me. Archon turned, and I saw even his pupils had been modified to have an upside-down teardrop shape.

“I am pleased to see our movement growing,” he said in a hissing, low voice. I felt almost hypnotized as I watched the split parts of his tongue moving independently. His voice had a quality unlike any other human voice I had ever heard. There were sounds in his words that shouldn’t exist.

I stepped forward, shaking inside, and extended my hand.

“It is nice to meet you, Archon,” I said. Archon grabbed my hand with immense strength. His skin felt like it was on fire, heat radiating out onto my palm. HIs eyes did not turn away from me, but simply observed me, reminding me of a slaughterhouse employee regarding his cattle.

“What do you want, Joe Larson?” he asked me, raising one eyebrow slightly, holding my hand tight and refusing to release it. The heat that radiated off of his body seemed to be growing. I felt extremely uncomfortable. I wanted to yank my hand back and run out of there, screaming like a maniac.

I took a deep breath, trying to control my shuddering body. I kept eye contact with Archon, knowing I could not exhibit any sign of weakness.

“The truth,” I said. He smiled at me, a wicked and sickly-looking gesture.

“The truth,” Archon replied, acting as if the word itself left a bad taste in his mouth. “As Pontius Pilate once asked, ‘What is truth?’” He let my hand go then, stepping back languidly as if nothing had happened. I had the sudden ridiculous urge to shove my hand in my pocket so he couldn’t grab it again.

“Can I ask you about your… changes, I guess… to your face?” I said. Archon looked bemused.

“It is only natural for new members to be curious. Of course, you can ask.

“Humans were never meant to speak Enochian, the language of the angels, the language of the demons also since they were once angels. Many of the sounds used are impossible to vocalize with such weak bodies. Unless, of course, you can alter this shell, this body made of meat.

“I was born a man, just a man, just like you, but didn’t Nietzsche tell us that, ‘Man is something that shall be overcome’? We must do whatever we can to overcome this frail worm of a shell. I have pushed myself as far as I can many times over. The scars of these surgeries are nothing compared to the scars of the mind. I have seen the Angel of Death, seen God. I have called upon the eternal ones, and they responded- greedily. Their appetites are ravenous. Like us, the angels must feed. They love human women, and they love the taste of fresh meat. But what they eat is not what you and I eat, my brother.

“Indeed, it is true that man is something that must be overcome, and I am that overcoming. I do not mind pushing this body to its utmost limits, if it means I can speak to the angels and demons, and even look into the mind of God from time to time.” Archon finished speaking, looking around at the assembled cult members. Many of them quickly averted their eyes. Yet Dax looked at him with reverence and awe.

“Man is something that shall be overcome,” Dax whispered to himself, and I heard the other cult members do the same, parroting the same expression as it went farther and farther out into the room. Then Archon’s lazy, pedantic expression changed, and he snapped to attention.

“Let us begin, then,” he said in a much deeper, gruffer tone. “You two-” he pointed at two random cultists in the corner- “grab Adam’s body. Bring it outside. The sacred fire should be lit. We will all meet in the back in one hour.

“Let us call on the ancient ones. Let us wake up the Angel of Death and give her sustenance.”

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was wandering the hallways. The use of the God Machine had stirred nearly everyone in the complex. It was as if a hornet’s nest had been kicked. People were crowded in the halls, walking to their rooms or talking. A few were even singing, mostly in some language I had never heard before. It sounded like Sanskrit, as if ancient Buddhist chants had been changed and given a low, guttural quality.

Most of the members looked excited, but I saw one woman who looked absolutely terrified. I caught her eye in the hallway near the cafeteria. She looked at me for a moment, then her eyes became downcast. With her blonde hair and blue eyes, she looked absolutely beautiful. If I had to guess, I would have said she was no more than twenty-years-old. I walked up to her, introducing myself as Joseph. She hesitated for a moment.

“I’m Mary,” she said.

“Were you with us when we turned on the God Machine an hour or so ago?” I asked. Her eyes widened.

“Oh, uh, no, I missed it,” she said sheepishly. “I’ve done it before.” She leaned close to my ear. “It was horrifying. I don’t really want to do it again. That *thing* in the machine looked within my heart and showed me eternity. It showed me some ancient world where pyramids floated in the sky and spires rose into the clouds, some place where the angles weren’t quite right and our world’s geometry didn’t apply. I ended up having a seizure and smashed my head on the ground.” Then she leaned back, looking away as if she had done something wrong. I frowned.

“I didn’t like it all either, to be honest,” I said. “That was one of the scariest experiences of my life. If I had to stay there for much longer, if I had to see that eternal thing for another ten minutes, I feel sure I would either be dead or insane.” I shook my head. “I think there are some things humans weren’t meant to see.” She nodded in agreement.

“But we are all required to go to the Angel of Death ceremony tonight,” she said. “Dax gave an announcement. Though, in reality, Archon runs this place. Dax just passes on whatever he thinks Archon wants.” I paused, wondering how much I should ask this woman. She seemed like one of the sweetest and most genuine people here. It was hard to believe she had joined such a cult. I had a feeling if I was going to find out what happened to Chrissy, then I would find it out from her.

“How did you end up in the God Machine?” I asked. She made eye contact, giving a small half-smile.

“Family.” She shrugged. “Archon is actually my half-brother. Though his birth name obviously isn’t Archon. He changed it a few years ago, after some really intense experience with the God Machine that left him in a catatonic state for a few days. He wouldn’t talk, or move on his own, or speak, or anything. We had to feed him through tubes. He just lay in bed, staring at the ceiling like a statue, and when he came out of it, he said God had revealed to him many things, including his new name.” I felt my eyes widen involuntarily as she spoke.

“Holy shit, your brother? You look and act nothing like him!” I said. Just as I felt we were entering into a rhythm of conversation, it was broken by an announcement that rang through the hallways.

“Everyone head out towards the back fire pit,” Dax said. “The ceremony is about to begin. You are *all* expected to attend.” The tinny, echoing announcement spat static for a second, and then died off instantaneously. Mary smiled up at me, taking my hand.

“Will you walk me out?” she said. I nodded, feeling her soft hand underneath mine. It felt so different from when I shook her half-brother’s hand. It didn’t have the feverish heat, the pulsating energy that seemed to emanate from his skin.

On our way, pushing through the rapidly-thinning crowds of people in the hallway, I came to another part of the complex I had never seen before. A poem on the wall, written in calligraphy, caught my eye.

*Impurity eats away at a man*

*Like rust through metal.*

*Without a foundation,*

*His mind falls apart.*

&#x200B;

*Wisdom builds up a man*

*Like strength everlasting.*

*With a foundation,*

*He soars to the heavens.*

&#x200B;

*Life is hard,*

*Filled with suffering,*

*Ending with death.*

*The darkness closes in*

*Around his chest.*

&#x200B;

*The darkness presses in,*

*And it seems eternal.*

*Yet for one who sees truly,*

*There’s nothing.*

&#x200B;

Next to it was a painting of a wide-eyed, skeletal man, his mouth opened in an eternal scream, his body covered in blood. Darkness surrounded him on all sides, seeming to press in on and suffocate the figure.

“Do you like it?” Mary asked me shyly. “I wrote it myself. And I did the painting. I did most of these paintings here.”

“It was very… unique,” I said. “Did you write the other poems around here too?” She nodded. I realized we were about to be alone in the hallway. Not wanting to be late, we hurried out the backdoor, Mary leading the way.

It was beautiful out there. The warmth of spring reassured me, the smell of flowers and grass carried in the soft breeze. A large river babbled, and beyond it, a dark forest stretched to the horizon. The sun had nearly gone, leaving us in twilight and shadows. The cult members gathered in a semi-circle around Archon, who stood on the banks of the shore. A large fire pit stood next to him, shooting out purple and blue flames. We quickly found a spot at the edge of the circle. I saw the dead body of the cult member laying next to Archon.

“The ceremony will begin,” he said. “Anyone who does not wish to see what we have to offer should *leave now.*” Then he turned his back on all of us, straightening, his silver robe sending off luminescent sparks in the darkness. He began to talk, but it was in no language I had ever heard before.

It reminded me, in some ways at least, of Tibetan, but it had a hissing, gurgling quality that didn’t exist in any language I had ever heard. His voice rapidly deepened as he chanted. The fire grew taller, sending out clouds of black smoke and changing from purplish-blue flames to dark gray ones. I watched him, and with horror, I realized something was happening on the other side of the stream.

Where there had been a forest only moments earlier, I now saw an ancient city. The angles seemed all wrong, as if it had been built using a type of geometry foreign to our universe. Pyramids that looked hundreds of stories high blotted out the Moon, and as I watched them, I realized they floated in the air, huge behemoths that resisted gravity as if they weighed no more than a dandelion seed. They looked like they had been covered with shimmering obsidian, reflecting the stars off of their surface. Twisting spires of silver and gold surrounded them. Floating orbs of fire lit the streets, moving up and down gently in the wind that flowed through our world and into theirs.

Archon began to speak faster, and the vision crystallized. But it was no longer just on the farther shore. *Something* was coming towards us.

It was in a blood-red boat, one that looked like it would have been at home in ancient Egyptian times. Archon had stopped speaking, and the cult members were so quiet that not a sound louder than a breath emanated from the group. All I could hear was the subtle splashing of the oars as the strange being in them methodically pulled them back, lifting them up and putting them back into the dark water below. I grabbed Mary’s hand again, feeling a sudden sense of fear and horror overtaking me. I didn’t know what was coming, but it was something I felt should not be here.

Archon got down on one knee, his head bowed as the boat pulled up to our shore. The thing inside got up with twisty, jerking movements, its bones and tendons creaking loudly the entire time. I saw its head had been twisted 180 degrees to face backwards. The skin on its neck was still intact, but it was also contorted. Folds of flesh were stuck in a permanent spiral pattern from whatever catastrophic injury had damaged its head.

“The Angel of Death,” Archon said, so silently I could barely hear him. “She who looks forever backwards.” Even though the being’s eyes were facing backwards, it had no problem navigating its way out of the boat. It moved in an eerie way, first so slow it barely moved at all, then in a blur so fast I didn’t even see its limbs for a moment. Within seconds, it stood next to Archon, putting one skeletal, emaciated hand on his forehead. He looked up in reverence. It hissed something at him in the same gurgling language that he had spoken. His eyes widened in terror for a moment. He tried to pull away, to get up, to free his head from the iron grip of the being. Then, in a flash, it clasped its hands on the top of his head, twisting it around and breaking his neck.

The snapping of bone reverberated like a gunshot in the utter silence of the night. He fell slowly, his backwards head looking in my direction for a moment as his pupils dilated and his mouth fell open, an expression of total fear that would forever be embedded into his surgically modified face.

The Angel of Death threw his body into its boat, causing it to rock and send out waves in every direction. It then bent down and grabbed the other body, the cult member who had died during the God Machine ritual, and threw it on top of him. The semi-circular formation of cult members was rapidly breaking apart. Looks of horror overtook the faces of all those present, and I knew without asking that none of this was part of the ritual.

Turning her body away from me, the Angel of Death looked directly at me. Her eyes were covered in a thin film of blood, her mouth gnashing constantly, showing sharpened teeth and a flicking, snake-like tongue. The rags she wore on her skeletal body blew slightly in the wind, and a smell like rotting tomatoes and putrefying bodies carried on the breeze towards me.

Without even realizing I was doing it, I started backing away, still holding onto Mary’s hand. With a skittering, jerking motion, the horrifying creature began to run at the cult members, and they scattered like cockroaches, running in all directions as death itself approached them.
