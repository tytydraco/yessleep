This happened years ago, but I can feel the icy knot of dread that settles in my stomach as I write this. Nobody will believe me, no matter who I tell. I feel like I'm going insane.

Thomas, or Tommy as I always call him, is my younger brother and, at the time of this story, he was at that age when his imagination ran wild in his little head. He usually said all sorts of weird things, but to me, they just sounded like some sort of harmless fairytale, so I never really paid much heed - until later, that is.

This one night, our mom was working a late shift at the hospital, so I was in charge of taking care of Tommy, making sure he went to bed on time. 
I was sat in the kitchen, hunched over my homework, which I was desperately trying to get done, when his timid voice broke my concentration.

"The man doesn't like it when you leave the window open," he said.

I looked up from my maths equations, puzzled. He stood at the bottom of the stairs in his dinosaur pyjamas, clutching his stuffed giraffe so tightly his knuckles were white.

"What man?" I asked, setting my pen down.

"The man in my bedroom wall," he said matter-of-factly. "He lives there, and he doesn't like the window being left open. He gets cold."

I smiled to myself, thinking that this was yet another imaginary friend that he had made in his mind, but something in the tone of his voice made me hesitate.

"And what does this man look like?" I asked, trying to sound casual.

Tommy hesitated. "Big and tall," he whispered. "He watches me at night."

"Sounds like he's a nice man, if he's keeping an eye on you when me and mom can't." I said, hoping to soothe him. This had happened before, after all. Tommy had gotten himself worked up in the past, becoming scared of the creatures his mind had created.

Tommy shook his head. "He scares me when it's dark," he said, his voice quivering. "His head hangs at a funny angle."

I, for some reason, felt nauseous when he said this. I forced a smile and said, "How about we leave your nightlight on tonight? I'll ask the man if it's okay."

Tommy nodded hesitantly. After tucking him in, I checked the window to make sure it was locked and glanced around the room.

"Hey, Mr. man," I said in a playful tone. "Is it all right if we leave Tommy's nightlight on tonight?" 

The quiet hung in a bit thicker than it ought to, and for an instant, the shadows seemed deeper. I shrugged the notion away, ruffling Tommy's hair. "See? He says that's okay."

Tommy was frowning, but he was too tired to protest. I gave him a goodnight kiss and left the room.

Over the next few days, I couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that settled on my chest. Tommy’s words replayed in my mind. His fear felt too real to dismiss.

A few nights later, while lying in bed, I heard faint scratching noises coming from Tommy’s room—soft, deliberate, like nails against wood. I wanted to dismiss it as the house settling, but deep down, I knew something was wrong.

I began to research the house, an old Victorian home we'd moved into a few years earlier. I mananged to find a decades-old newspaper article about a man named Arthur Dunlop in the library's archives.

The headline read: Local Man Found Dead in Home—Cause Ruled Suicide.

Arthur Dunlop, a man in his late 30s, had been found dead in the house. The cause of death was a gunshot wound, but what caught my attention was the description: "His body was found in a sitting position, with his head at an unusual angle, as if it had been twisted unnaturally."

I felt my heart drop.

The connection was just too chilling to ignore.

A few days later, I sat Tommy down in the kitchen. "Can you tell me more about the man in the wall?" I asked softly.

Tommy clutched his stuffed giraffe tightly and looked up towards the walls, as if checking to see anyone but us were in the kitchen. 

"He's sad," he told me. "He doesn't like being alone. He say that house belongs to him."

Tommy's voice dropped to a whisper as he pulled me close to him, like he wasn't allowed to be telling me any of this. He was acting like it was some big secret. 

"When it's cold, it hurts him. That's why he doesn't like the window open, he'll get angry... and take me into the walls."

I remember how those words sent a shiver down my spine.

That night, I tucked Tommy in, making sure the window was locked and the nightlight was on. I stayed up, listening. Shortly after midnight I heard it once more—the faint scratching. Racing upstairs, I found Tommy sitting upright in bed, tears streaming down his face.

"He's mad," Tommy whimpered. "He's mad because you asked too many questions."

Before I could answer, the nightlight flickered and everything went dark.

The room's temperature dropped drastically, so much so that I could see my own breath, and the wall opposite Tommy's bed started to ripple. 

A hump in the wall began to bulge outward, as if something was trying to press through from the other side. A low moan rumbled as a dark shape materialized, lanky-climbed, hunchbacked, its head swinging loose in an impossible position.

"He is mine!" Came a growling, gurgling voice as the shape got closer. "I shall take what is mine."

"No!" I screamed, grabbing Tommy and pulling him close.

The man's shadowy form loomed closer. The cold intensified, and the air felt like it was being sucked toward the wall. Desperate, I threw the window open, letting a blast of icy wind rush in. The man let out a horrible scream as his form began to writhe and dissolve, like the cold air was tearing him apart.

The room shook, and then everything was still. The oppressive chill lifted, and the man was gone.

Tommy and I never spoke about that night again. The house felt normal after that—no more scratches, no more flickering lights. As Tommy grew older, he forgot the man entirely. I almost did too...

Until tonight.

Tucking my eight-year-old daughter into bed, she clutched her giraffe, the one that used to belong to Tommy, and looked at me with wide, frightened eyes.

"Mommy," she whispered, her voice quivering. "The man in the wall doesn't like it when you leave the window open."
