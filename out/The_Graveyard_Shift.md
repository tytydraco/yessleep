The graveyard shift at Rosewood General was always quiet, almost too quiet. As a night nurse, I had grown used to the stillness, the way the hum of fluorescent lights and the rhythmic beeping of monitors became a kind of eerie lullaby. But something about 3:00 a.m. always unsettled me. It was the hour when the air felt heavier, the shadows darker, and the silence sharper.

That night started like any other. I was stationed on the surgical floor, where most patients were sedated or asleep. The hallways were dimly lit, stretching long and empty in both directions. My only companions were the occasional hum of the coffee machine in the break room and the faint creaks of the old building settling.

At 2:57 a.m., I was sitting at the nurse’s station, finishing up some notes on a patient’s chart, when the overhead lights flickered. Just a quick flash, nothing unusual in an old hospital like this. But then the monitors at the station all blinked off, their screens going dark for a few heartbeats before rebooting. I stared at them, confused. Power outages were rare, and the backup generators usually kicked in instantly.

That’s when I heard it.

A faint, wet slapping sound echoed down the hall, coming from Room 312, one of the empty post-op rooms. It was the kind of sound you’d expect from a mop dragging across a wet floor—or something else, something alive.

I grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the room. My footsteps felt too loud in the silence, and the closer I got, the colder the air seemed to become. The door to Room 312 was slightly ajar, the overhead light inside flickering sporadically. I pushed the door open with my foot, flashlight raised.

The bed in the room was empty, its sheets pulled off and lying in a crumpled heap on the floor. But the wet sound continued, now coming from the corner near the window. My heart pounded as I swung the beam of my flashlight toward the noise.

At first, I couldn’t process what I was seeing. A figure was hunched over in the corner, its back to me. It wore a hospital gown, but the fabric was soaked, clinging to its skin with something dark and viscous. Its shoulders heaved as it made a sickening crunching noise, like someone biting into cartilage. I took a step back, my flashlight trembling in my hand.

“Hello?” I whispered, my voice barely audible.

The figure froze, the crunching sound ceasing abruptly. Slowly, it turned its head to look at me, and my stomach dropped. Its face—or what was left of it—was a grotesque mess. Flesh hung in loose, jagged strips, exposing muscle and bone beneath. One of its eyes was missing, leaving a hollow, oozing socket. Its mouth was smeared with blood, bits of what looked like raw meat clinging to its teeth.

It smiled at me.

A low, guttural growl escaped its throat as it rose to its feet, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a marionette being yanked upright. It took a step toward me, and that’s when I saw what it had been feeding on: a dismembered arm, its fingers still twitching. The arm’s wedding ring caught the light, and I recognized it—it belonged to one of the surgeons who’d been working late that night.

I stumbled back, my flashlight falling from my hand and clattering to the floor. Darkness swallowed the room, and I heard the wet slap of bare feet moving closer. My survival instincts kicked in, and I bolted, running down the hallway as fast as I could. My breathing was ragged, my pulse pounding in my ears.

But the thing in Room 312 wasn’t alone.

As I ran, I saw them—shadows flickering in the corners of the hallways, moving with unnatural speed. Figures emerged from patient rooms, their bodies twisted and wrong. One man’s torso was split open, his ribcage exposed, yet he moved with purpose, dragging a scalpel along the wall. A woman in a bloodied hospital gown crawled on all fours, her head lolling unnaturally as she giggled, the sound high-pitched and distorted.

I made it back to the nurse’s station, slamming the door behind me and locking it. My hands shook as I grabbed the phone, dialing security. The line crackled, but no one picked up. All I could hear was static—and then a faint whisper:

“They see you.”

The lights in the station flickered, and when they came back on, I wasn’t alone. Standing on the other side of the desk was a figure in scrubs. At first glance, he looked normal—short hair, a surgical mask, the standard blue uniform. But then I noticed the blood seeping through his mask, dripping onto the floor in slow, deliberate drops. His eyes were black voids, endless and hungry.

Before I could scream, he lunged across the desk, grabbing me with hands that felt impossibly cold. His grip was like iron as he pulled me closer, and I could see his mouth beneath the mask. It wasn’t human. Rows of sharp, jagged teeth lined his gums, and his jaw unhinged like a snake’s.

The last thing I saw before everything went dark was his mouth descending toward my face, and the sound of wet chewing filled my ears.

When the day shift arrived at 7:00 a.m., they found the nurse’s station empty. The monitors were all off, and the lights in Room 312 were still flickering. No one ever saw me again, but sometimes, on the graveyard shift, staff have reported hearing footsteps in the hallway and faint whispers at 3:00 a.m. They say if you listen closely, you can still hear someone calling for help.

But you should never go looking.
