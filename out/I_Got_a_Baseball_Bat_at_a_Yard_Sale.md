Me and my dad used to go ride around on weekends and go to yard sales. You never knew what you would truly find, especially in rich neighborhoods. Some people let go of stuff for practically nothing. We finally got back into looking.

We recently rode through a rich neighborhood and seen an elderly couple sitting in lawn chairs behind a couple tables. My dad pulled into their driveway.

“Come on boy, let’s see what goodies we come across.”

He got out and gave them a smile and a wave. 

“Morning! How are y’all.”

The old man spoke up after taking a sip from a coffee mug.

“Good morning. Anything you’re looking for?”

“Ah, just looking around.” 

We searched through the tables and area. We seen some nice fishing poles, hats, tools. We bought a handful of stuff. The old man spoke up.

“Young man, do you like baseball.”

I played baseball for my school and enjoyed watching it on tv.

“Yes sir.” 

“Young man, how would you like this baseball bat?” He reached below his seat.

I looked at it. It was an old wooden bat. I’ve bought many of them and either sold them and some never even used. 

“Nah I got plenty.”

“I wasn’t asking if you’d like to buy it. I’d like to gift it to you.”

I looked up and he had a big smile on his face, his wife was smiling too. 

“Come on don’t turn down an old man’s offer like that.”

“Umm….Okay. Thank you.” 

He reached over and handed it to me.

“Now young man, understand this. Don’t let anyone else but you touch it. Your family, friends, no one. This bat is very special. It’s been very good to me….Don’t regift it until told otherwise. And don’t forget, don’t let anyone but you touch it.”

I thanked him once more before tossing it in the back of my dads truck along with other stuff we got. My dad was tickled pink that I got that for free and happy to see there is kind people out there. I couldn’t wrap my mind around what he meant.

“Don’t regift it until told otherwise.” 

We hit up a few more yard sales before tackling a breakfast buffet. My dad always loved doing this at the ass crack of dawn.

“The early bird gets the worm.”

We got home and began loading stuff into his building. I grabbed the bat and tossed it into a corner that had a handful of other bats I probably wouldn’t use. I had a lot nicer ones we came across for cheap. 

Once we got passed the weekend and I was getting ready for school I went to grab  my baseball gear and load up the car. 

I can’t really describe it but I had an Incredible urge all the sudden, like a voice in my head telling me.

“Bring the new bat instead” I tried to push the thought out but it kept coming back until it was all I could think about. I walked out to dads building and swapped out for the new one. 

School went by normal and my friend Susie came by my car before practice. I was grabbing my gear and she was making small talk as usual. Another “voice” in my head made notice.

“She likes you, ask her out.” 

I blurred out that after practice I’d like to take her to a pizza place down the road. She got so excited. I felt good inside too. She was beautiful and a good friend. I had no idea she’d go out with me.

Practice was so weird. I wasn’t that great of a player. I was okay at best and the chances of a college scholarship or MLB wanting me was slim to none. I played in the outfield and caught majority of balls my way. But I was hitting home runs like never before. Every time I was at bat was a huge smack followed by team amazement. 

The next game we had went the same. I was first at bat and I hit more home runs during that game than I did my entire last season. Susie caught up with me after the game and kissed me. I began watching my bat like a hawk too. I remember telling my coach I’d grab my own bat after running to home. I guess he thought it as some special ritual I kept like a lot of pros do.

I remember dreaming that night of me being asked my ever Major League Baseball team to come play for them. Susie with with me and she was ecstatic for me. 

A few games go by and I’m hitting home runs consistently. I began getting offers for scholarships to play in college. Rumors were being spread that a pro team was scouting me too. My parents kept telling me they wanted to me to take a scholarship so I could avoid student loans. I was the popular kid all the sudden.

The last game we had today was different though. We were dominating the other team and I currently had four home runs. Keith walked by me casually at his turn to bat. He reached down and quickly grabbed mine before I could stop him.

“I’m gonna try to get some of this mojo you been blessing us with big dog.” I let out a big yell as if I was going to punch him. 

He froze a moment and had a big, curled up smile. I swear he wasn’t even blinking. He walked past the dugout and towards the gate where the crowd was. All of the others were hollering for him to get back.

“Keith, you’re up. What the hell are you doing!” Coach was red faced and screaming. 

He walked over to where Principal James’s car was and began attacking it. He had a big grin while busting windows, tearing off the mirrors. The crowd was in shock and the team was trying to get to him.

Principle James got to him first.

“Kid! What on Gods green earth are you doing!? You know how much that’s gonna cost. I can tell you that you’ll be kicked off the team and suspended, hell maybe expelled!”

CRACK

The bad swung across his head, knocking him down.  He turned towards everyone. 

“Who wants to play next?” His voice sounded different. 

His parents were running towards him.

“Honey, drop it.” His mom was sobbing.

“Quiet, you old bitch or you’re next.” 

His dad ran up to stop him and he got smacked down too.

The school officer pulled out his gun and pointed it at Keith.

“Drop the bat, kid. Just drop it and put your hands up nice and slowly.” 

He let out a loud and wicked cackle and charged the officer with the bat up.

The sound of four shots going off and his mothers screams will forever haunt me. I won’t be sleeping tonight. 

The bat flew out of his arms and people scrambled. I grabbed it and drove off.

Some officers came by and told me they needed the bat for evidence. The voice came again

“Give them a different one, not me.” 

It was hidden under my bed and I took them to dads building and handed them an old, worn one that looked similar. I’m really scared guys.
