NASA detected an abnormal object slowly moving towards Earth, propelled by an unknown force. A taskforce was established to further study the object. Upon further inspection, it was identified as a massive, deceased entity. The MUCO, or Massive Unidentified Celestial Organism, was deemed a global threat.

June 20, 2026

The United States launched an explosive into the atmosphere, aiming to annihilate the MUCO. However, the explosion barely even repulsed the corpse. A new plan was conceived.

THE MUCO

The Massive Unidentified Celestial Organism is approximately 260 kilometers in length, nearing the size of the US state Pennsylvania. Advanced telescopes determined that the organism has two front appendages with seemingly webbed fingers. The body is long and serpentine, like a lungfish. The tail appears to have some sort of organ laid throughout the back fin, possibly to propel it through the void. It’s head resembles no life on Earth. It does not possess eyes but has a mouth that faintly resembles a beak.

June 22, 2026

The MUCO is now approximately 400,000 kilometers away from Earth. Scientists noted that the tides were affected by the moon’s sudden shift caused by the gravitational pull of the organism. It is predicted that the MUCO will make contact with Earth in less than two weeks. The public was made aware.

Interview with Dr. Beyers, age 57

“What I think of it? Christ, that’s a loaded question. This is more baffling than finding out Greek mythology was real. It’s…”

*Beyers sighs and scratches his head nervously*

“People are freaking out as we speak. It isn’t going to get better, knowing us. Set some time aside to be with family and friends. That’s all the advice I have. If you want to know what that… thing is, I have nothing.”

High levels of cosmic radiation, similar to that of the sun, began emitting from the organism’s soft surface tissue. Nearby satellites went offline. The MUCO is 368 kilometers away from Earth, its speed speeding and slowing randomly.

On the same day, a religion began to form. The Astral Godhand was founded by the public due to mass hysteria. The religion believes in divine selection, claiming that the organism was sent to deliver them to heaven. The Astral Godhand feuded with most other religions. The Catholic Church publicly denounced the Astral Godhand, leading to a massive spike in senseless hate crimes against both parties. Social media was also divided on the topic. Many believed the astral organism was an extinction event, others claimed the government created the lie to control the people.

Interview with anonymous cult member:

*A cult member wearing an orange robe and hospital mask is pulled aside. He appears disgruntled by the sudden disturbance by the rookie press.*

“What is it your religion worships? Do you worship the giant monster as your god?”

*The cult member clears his throat.* “We do not worship the beast itself, though it is a god. We worship the inevitable collision that ends all life on Earth. Only then will we be delivered into the afterlife.”

“So… you want to die?”

“No, we want to get to heaven. Before the calvary arrives on our planet, our sect will get a head start.”

*Interviewer pauses, then turns off the camera*

Change of collision with Earth: 98.53%.

June 25, 2026

NASA determined that the impact would occur in South America. Mass evacuations began almost instantly. Millions of refugees were moved to the United States, causing a national outcry from the citizens. The American president attempted to deny the immigrants entry, but the order was overridden by NATO. Nationwide panic set in. over 10,000 deaths were reported in the US on the first day, presumably due to suicide and murder. Deaths only increased in number.

The sudden explosion of immigrants was catastrophic for the United States. Being unprepared and ill-equipped, the government could not handle the sudden population boom. Fears of mass starvation grew rampant.

June 28, 2026

Mass suicides were reported in North America, presumably members of the Astral Godhand. Canada closed its borders completely after becoming overwhelmed with displaced immigrants. China, Russia, and the United States gave up on launching missiles as the MUCO closed the distance.

June 30, 2026

Many coastal cities were flooded by the tides. The Florida Everglades were completely decimated by the flood. Civilians migrated to areas of high elevation.

July 2, 2026

A liquid began to rain down. The liquid, composed of hydrogen, sulfur, carbon, and oxygen, was likely the blood of the organism. Most of the world was coated in a layer of dried blood. Removal was impossible, as more blood quickly covered any progress. An illness sprung up all over the globe.

The illness, nicknamed “blood flu” spread via liquid surfaces. Upon exposure, a person will experience nausea, lightheadedness, and strained movements. After 2-6 days, the sick person will succumb to the illness and die of exhaustion.

Reported deaths: 2,834,990

July 4, 2026

All jobs were abandoned. Billionaires and government officials disappeared. Streets across the globe were littered with the dying and murdered. A gargantuan silhouette appeared in the sky, blocking out the sun.

July 5, 2026

The dead god had entered Earth’s atmosphere. Social media platforms were swamped by optimistic posts made by the remaining Astral Godhand cult. The MUCO’s head was visible in south Peru. The torso and arms hovered over Brazil and Bolivia. The tail, primarily in Brazil, fell first.

Upon entering Earth’s gravity, the deceased lifeform plummeted towards the ground. 23% of the organism’s body mass burned up upon entry. A deafening groaning sound was reported as the lifeform plummeted to Earth, possibly gasses escaping the corpse.

The corpse collided with Earth in a flash of light. Tsunamis formed across the globe as earthquakes ravaged the planet. South America was quickly pummeled by chunks of flesh and blood. All major cities in the region were destroyed during the impact. Radiation levels increased tenfold. The heat and radiation spewing from the exploding corpse vaporized thousands of kilometers.

The impact caused a massive nuclear winter, blocking out the sun and choking the planet in ash and blood. Religious people claimed that Judgement Day arrived, while the Astral Godhand faded into obscurity after mass suicide. It is unknown what led the cult to suicide. Gastric acids leaked into the Earth, carving elaborate caverns.

The remains of the cosmic entity were spread crudely across the Earth’s crust. Approximately 3 billion lives were lost in the first week.

July 5, 2027

The newly formed organization RUN, or Recovery Unit of Nations, gathered their goal of 10,000 survivors in their headquarters located in France. A large-scale steel roof was assembled over the city to protect the citizens from ash and blood, but oxygen is no longer breathable. North America, South America, and most of Asia is uninhabitable and desolate. The oceans are red and only occupied by massive, whale-sized parasites originating from the MUCO.

RECOVERY UNIT OF NATIONS

RUN was established on December 9, 2026. RUN quickly constructed a base of operations in France using all available materials. Gas masks were quickly distributed to French civilians and refugees. RUN is a democracy, as each civilian has a right to vote.

Interview with Rowan Quinn, founder of RUN

“It isn’t easy, working for the people. Humanity has struggled with food and defense, but we truly got lucky. Every person here wants to live, and I find that incredible. I want to be the best leader because everyone deserves a good leader after what we’ve been through.”

An earthquake ravaged RUN headquarters, nearly destroying the steel roof. As earthquakes continue in magnitude, RUN headquarters reinforced their foundations.

The oceans have been closed after the last container ship was sunk by a titan leech. The new ocean, the Biocean, resides in what was once South America. It is the most biologically diverse place on the planet thanks to the decaying remnants of the MUCO. Although trees do not exist outside of shelters, towering plants similar to them grow from the bloody soil. It is theorized that these plants are tissue remnants. Massive arthropods roam the lands and seas, feeding on decaying matter. Any arthropod detected near the bases are swiftly exterminated to prevent loss of life. Due to radiation, the Biocean is completely uninhabitable to Earth life.

August 4, 2027

The organic biome surrounding the MUCO began to spread. Earthquakes became more and more frequent.

August 10, 2027

The Earth shook for three days straight, before a massive organism emerged from the Earth’s crust. The lifeform originated from the decaying MUCO, presumably its offspring. The lifeform, designated MUCO Minor, propelled itself into the atmosphere via unknown means. A cloud of dust engulfed everything in a 100km radius. Luckily, no civilians were in the area.

August 11, 2027

Using the remnants of NASA technology, RUN located the infant god in its larval stage as it traveled away from Earth.

MUCO Minor

Approximately 50 kilometers in length, the Massive Unidentified Celestial Organism Minor is the parasitic offspring of the MUCO. It is theorized that the MUCO gestated MUCO Minor for years and forced it into dormancy as it died. The offspring likely matured and hatched from the womb of its dead parent. The life cycle of the MUCO is still unknown.

Recovery operation complete. Ending logs.
