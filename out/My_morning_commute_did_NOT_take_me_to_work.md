Monday January 8th 2024 started out just like any other day. The only notable thing was that it was my first day heading back to the office after my employer had shut down company operations for 3 weeks as they did every year during the holidays. The seasonal depression was really starting to kick in now that all the fun was over and we just had another three months of freezing rain to look forward to before summer. Winter used to be my favourite season as a kid but due to climate change it's just become depressing. It hardly ever snows anymore here in the GTA so everything is just cold, grey and damp all the time, today being no exception. 

Traffic on the 404 was actually moving at a decent pace for once this morning despite the weather. I was torn between being happy that I wasn't stuck in the typical morning gridlock and being slightly disappointed that I would actually make it to work on time. As I approached the 401 interchange where the 404 turns into the Don Valley Parkway the rain began to come down a lot harder. The dump truck I'd been following began to slow down, as did the rest of the traffic around me. I could have sworn I heard thunder over the roar of the rain pelting my windshield. "Thunderstorms in the winter time?" I thought to myself. It didn't make sense but then again it was also supposed to be -10 and snowing this time of year not 6 degrees and pouring down rain so I guess anything is possible.

I began pressing down on the brake pedal to slow my car to the speed of the truck in front of me when suddenly my foot slammed into the floor. I immediately panicked thinking I had lost my brakes and I took my right hand off the steering wheel to reach for the emergency brake. When I'd first started driving my dad had taught me a trick where you can hold down the button on the emergency brake so it doesn't lock and you can feather it on and off to slow down if you ever lose your brakes. I was about halfway through executing this plan when I froze. I froze because I realized something. The hand I had taken off the steering wheel hadn't been holding the steering wheel at all, and neither was the other one. In fact I wasn't even in my car. My brain finally caught up to my surroundings and I realized I was sitting in a plastic classroom chair in the middle of what appeared to be a warehouse. I was sitting in the chair with my arms out as if I was a kid pretending to drive a car, except I was actually driving a car, or at least I had been just mere seconds ago. Had I just blacked out on the entire drive to work? I did work at a logistics company but this did not look like our warehouse.

I slowly stood up and looked around the room. All I could see around me were wooden crates and plastic Pelican cases that looked vaguely like military gear of some kind. The only other object of note was a big yellow forklift sitting near the end of the row of crates. I began to walk towards it thinking maybe I could find the operator and figure out just what the hell was going on. An electric hum came from the forklift as I approached it. I don't know a lot about heavy machinery but I assumed that meant it was running. "Hello?" I shouted out into the vast expanse of the building. Only an echo returned. I peaked inside the cab of the forklift and indeed it was on judging by the position of the key and the gauges on the dash being lit up. This meant someone had to be nearby because I'm sure it's gotta be a massive OSHA violation to leave a forklift turned on unattended. 

I called out a few more times but no reply came. Was everyone out for a smoke break or something? Surely a warehouse of this size would be crawling with workers, at least ours was back at the company I worked for. Figuring everyone was out for a smoke break or at the very least, given the early morning, it was probably shift change, I decided to see if I could find an office of any kind to see if anyone could tell me where I was. I had briefly tried to consult Google Maps on my phone but I couldn't get any signal, likely due to being inside a large steel building. I eventually spotted some windows high up on a wall on the other side of the warehouse and figured that must be the office. As I walked towards it I passed another forklift that looked like it had just been abandoned in the middle of putting a pallet of electronic equipment up on a rack. Just like the other one the electric hum and position of the key indicated that it had been left on. A little farther up the aisle there was a golf cart with a little orange blinking light on top of it. It had crashed into one of the metal support columns holding up the roof of the warehouse and front end was completely destroyed. It just sat there light still blinking as I walked past it. What the hell was going on here? Was there some emergency I was unaware of? I was beginning to get the feeling the staff of this place had abandoned it in a hurry.

Eventually I reached a set of metal stairs that led up to an enclosed mezzanine area that I thought had to be the office. I climbed the stairs and opened the door to find the room completely empty. It was indeed an office but instead of the loud atmosphere I was used to at work it was dead silent. I slowly walked through the rows of cubicles taking note of the steam coming off a coffee cup on one of the desks. People had been here recently. The most telling sign of all though was that every single computer was logged in and open on some excel sheets or software that I didn't recognize. I may not have known a lot about forklifts but I did know a lot about office computers. They time out after 5 minutes or so automatically and go to sleep. When you wake them up again you have to enter your password again. If these computers were logged in it meant that their users couldn't have gone far or been gone for long.

Figuring now that something must really be wrong I quickly scanned the room and found a door with a glowing red exit sign above it. I didn't know how I'd gotten here but the people who worked here had clearly left in a hurry and I wasn't going to stick around to find out why. I ran through the office and tore open the exit door revealing a long hallway. I ran down the the hallway towards another exit sign and just kept repeating the process through door after door until suddenly I was blasted with cold air and snow as I found myself standing in what appeared to be a parking lot. It had clearly been snowing heavily but the blizzard was starting to clear and the morning light was beginning to shine through the snow, although the light was extremely dim and I couldn't actually see the sun in the sky yet. Where the hell was I? It hadn't snowed like this anywhere near Toronto or my home in Newmarket since, well, ever that I can remember.

My awe of the snow was short lived however as I heard the door click shut behind me. My heart sank as I realized it was locked and it looked like it had a keycard reader to open it again. I was wearing a light winter jacket over my usual business suit but it was not sufficient for the weather I now faced. I could hear an engine running from around the corner of the building so I began trudging through to snow towards it. My fancy dress shoes and suit pants becoming instantly soaked as I made my way through knee deep snow. My feet stung with the cold but I didn't care, that engine sound meant someone had to be nearby and they could help me. Maybe it was a fire truck or an ambulance and they had come to deal with whatever disaster had befallen this frigid warehouse. Maybe I would find the office staff huddled around it. I should have known better.

As I came around the corner of the building I almost walked straight into a running snowblower. My efforts to stop myself caused me to fall backwards into the snow and I began to scramble backwards to get out of the way of the machine. Once I had gotten out of the way and gotten to my feet I realized that it wasn't moving. My heart sank again as I stared at the large John Deere tractor sitting in front of me. Much like the forklifts and golf cart I had seen inside the machine was just sitting there idling as if it had been abandoned in the middle of whatever its task was. In this case it looked like it was about halfway done clearing the parking lot. "Great," I mumbled to myself. It seemed that everyone really was gone. At least if that thing had been running for a while the cab was probably warmed up and it could provide some shelter.

I approached the tractor cautiously as the large augers of the snowblower attachment were still spinning and I did not want to encounter those again. Once I was safely alongside however, I practically threw myself up the steps into the cab. The warmth of the heaters felt almost burning compared to the cold outside but I didn't care. It was better than freezing to death. I leaned back in the operator's seat and just lay there for a few seconds enjoying it. Then I noticed something peculiar. There were no footprints leading away from the machine. If the operator had abandoned it as recently as the rest of the complex had been abandoned then there should have been signs of them running away. The snow was also letting up and there was no way it had snowed enough in the 10 minutes or so I'd been in this strange place to fill in the footprints. Hell there should have been footprints everywhere if a large scale evacuation had taken place. Something strange was definitely going on here.

For the first time since my arrival however, I finally felt safe enough sitting in that tractor cab that I could survey my surroundings. The snow had now completely stopped and I could see that I was sitting next to a massive white building at the bottom of what appeared to be a giant open pit mining site. Rock walls rose up on all sides with a spiral roadway leading to the top. There was also a massive radio tower on top of the building that must have been at least 100 feet above the surface level. It appeared to be held up by cables running down to the rim of the giant pit. Seeing the tower I foolishly tried my phone again but there was still no signal. I stuffed it back in my pocket and continued to look around. From what I could tell it looked like this was some kind of research facility that had been built into an old diamond mine. My suspicions were quickly confirmed as I noticed a row of white pickup trucks with the words "Summer Island Research Facility" written on the doors and various departments such as security or maintenance written along the sides of the bed. Well at least now I knew where I was, just not where this place was.

As luck would have it there was a much more substantial winter jacket stuffed behind the seat of the tractor and inside one of the pockets was a keycard. With this maybe I could get back inside and formulate a plan to deal with my current situation. I put on the jacket and once again braved the cold and made my way back to the door I had come out of. The light on the door turned green as I tapped the keycard up against it and a loud clunk indicated it was now unlocked. I quickly stepped inside and furiously stomped my feet to try and get all the snow off my shoes and pants. I had a better coat now but I needed to find some boots and snowpants if I was going to go outside again. My new mission was now to find an employee locker room or something where I could find some gear. I wandered up an down the halls finding nothing but empty office after empty office. I was beginning to contemplate my situation more and I wondered if I had in fact rear ended that dump truck back on the 404 and died in a horrible car accident and if this was some kind of purgatory. Even though I had only been here an hour tops at this point my morning commute and even my life back in Newmarket seemed like a distant memory. Was all that even real? Or was this even real? I had no idea how I'd even gotten here and the more I thought about it the more questions I had.

Eventually I stumbled into a lab of some kind. I guessed that this was where the research at the Summer Island Facility took place. There was  lot of science equipment that I couldn't even begin to tell you what it was for scattered around the room and several computer desks all covered in papers. A large whiteboard in the corner of the room caught my attention. It was covered in what I guessed were mathematical equations but mixed in with the numbers were symbols I have never seen before. At the far end of the room was a large glass wall and on the other side of it was a device that slightly resembled a jet engine with the cowlings removed. "Must be testing something for a new fighter plane," I thought to myself but as I drew closer I realized this was not an aircraft engine. The front end where the fan blades would be and the rear where the thrust would come out were capped off completely and what I initially thought were hoses turned out to be thick electrical cables. Every now and then sparks shot out of the machine but otherwise it was completely silent. Had thing thing malfunctioned somehow and that's why everyone left in such a hurry? I was fine so what could be so dangerous. Then a terrible thought struck me, what if this was nuclear and the whole place was irradiated?

I decided my best course of action at this point was to continue looking for the gear I needed then get as far away from this place as possible. While I knew that tractor was still running outside it was slow and I had no idea how to drive a tractor, I needed to find the keys to one of those trucks and get up to the surface and figure out where I was. Luckily for me the locker room was not far from the lab and by some stroke of luck there was a locker open. Judging by the same high-vis winter jacket I had found in the tractor that hung inside the locker this must have belonged to one of the maintenance workers. I took the matching snow pants, boots and gloves out and quickly put them on. Rummaging around a little more I managed to find a hat and some snow goggles as well. I probably looked like I was ready to climb Mount Everest but I guess in a way that's exactly what I was about to do. I found a set of car keys on one of the tables and quickly snatched them up looking them over and noticing the Ram Trucks logo on the side of the key fob. At least it wouldn't take long to figure out which vehicle these were for. So far I had only seen F-150s outside.

I pulled my goggles down over my eyes as I ventured back out into the cold. It was a little brighter out now but it still seemed way too dark for the time of day it should have been by now. I pressed the panic button on the key fob and heart a repeated car horn coming from around the opposite corner to where the tractor was. I followed the sound until I was around the corner of the building and looking at a big Dodge Ram dually truck with a camper in the bed. It was covered in all kinds of antennas and had some kind of radar system on the roof and a big moose bumper with a winch mounted on the front. It had the same "Summer Island Research Facility" lettering on the doors and the words "Mobile Research Unit" written on the camper that sat in the bed. I remember thinking of my coworker James who wouldn't shut up about his overlanding rig, an old Toyota 4Runner with a collapsible rooftop tent. This truck was his wet dream.

I silenced the alarm and unlocked the vehicle. Climbing into the driver's seat I noticed the interior of the truck looked like a police car. There was a laptop mounted to the center console and all kinds of radio and electronic equipment. There was what appeared to be a CB radio overhead which I turned on and quickly flipped through a few channels but heard nothing. I put the key in the ignition and while the big diesel engine wasn't happy about turning over in the cold it did start. I sat there and let the truck warm up for a minute or two before setting off out of the parking area. Thankfully although the tractor operator had only manged to clear the snow from half of the parking lot it appeared as though the spiral road heading up to the surface had been plowed. Even still it was slow going as I didn't want to slide off the edge and plummit back into the pit. 

It took about 15 minutes but I eventually reached the surface and stopped to survey the area. I put the truck in park and got out as if the windhshield was somehow lying to me about what was outside. For as far as I could see there was nothing but snow. Not a single tree in sight and although by this point it had to be at least 11AM and it was completely clear the sun was nowhere to be found in the sky. The only proof of its existence was the dim light coming from over the horizon that was allowing me to see. Was I in the fucking Arctic??? I let out a frustrated scream. What the hell was going on? I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Just hours ago I had been driving into downtown Toronto and now somehow inexplicably I was on the edge of a research facility at the North fucking Pole???

Off in the distance on top of a hill I could see lights in the direction that the road was heading. Maybe that's where everyone had gone and maybe I could get some answers there. I jumped back in the truck and took off down the bumpy road as fast as I could go in the snowy conditions. My excitement was short lived however as I arrived at the lights and realized they were landing lights for a small airstrip adjacent to the facility. I punched the steering wheel in frustration causing the horn to honk. I had heard there were places in the Arctic that were only accessable by plane. If this was one of them and everyone had gone then I truly was trapped up here. I shut the engine off and rested my head on the steering wheel. I'm a bit ashamed to admit it but I had a complete mental breakdown. I couldn't understand anything that was going on and now I was trapped in one of the most hostile places on earth with no way home.

My wallowing in self pity was short lived as I suddenly heard the sound of an approaching plane. I was overjoyed at the sound of this and immediately got out of the truck and began searching the skies for the incoming aircraft. Much like my self pity my feelings of joy were also short lived as I spotted the plane coming low on the horizon. It was moving far too quickly to be a commercial jet or military cargo plane. No there was only one thing that could be and it was a fighter plane. I don't know a lot about the military but they don't generally send fighter planes on rescue missions. At the same time as realization struck me that this was not the government coming to the rescue but rather a coverup for whatever happened here, the plane fired a single missile at the edge of the massive pit. From my vantage point on the hill by the airstrip I saw it collide with the rock wall and explode sending rock and ice flying into the air. Then what I had initially assumed was solid ground began to collapse into the pit revealing itself to be a frozen body of water. Within seconds the pit was flooded and the impact from the wave pancaked the building and sent the communications tower collapsing to the bottom of the newly formed lake. The plane circled around again heading for the airstrip. I dove back into the truck and hoped the white vehicle would blend in with the snow enough not to be seen by the pilot. It did, or at the very least the pilot didn't think it necessary to destroy a stationary vehicle. The plane fired off one more missile cratering the runway and then flew off again disappearing over the horizon. 

I peeked up over the steering wheel as the last few pieces of rock came down denting the hood of the truck. There was now no way for anyone to even land to come save me but that was the least of my problems. Whatever was going on the government clearly didn't want it getting out. If I was found I would probably be shot on sight even though I had nothing to do with it. My best bet was to get as far away from this place as possible and then try to seek help. My only problem was I still had no idea where I was and all I had was this truck. If there were no roads out of here I was screwed. There probably were snowmobiles in that facility somewhere and I was kicking myself for not trying to find one before the facility got destroyed. Out of desparation I opened the laptop mounted to the truck's console and found that shockingly it was not locked with a password. It seemed this latop served only for navigation but that was fine with me as that's exactly what I needed. Even more shockingly it did appear to have a connection to some kind of satelite system and from that I was able to pull up a map and finally saw where I was. 

I was indeed in the Arctic Ocean on an island roughly 30 kilometres from Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories. My heart sank upon this realization. If I was on an island then that airstrip really was the only way in or out. If the base hadn't been destroyed I might've been able to survive up here till spring and found a boat or something once the ice melted but it was gone now and I definitely couldn't survive in this truck. Wait a minute, the ice, that was it! The water was frozen over between here and the mainland if I could make it across then I might be able to find help in Tuktoyaktuk. It was a longshot but I had to try. I quickly took stock of the supplies I had in the truck then checked out the camper sitting in the bed. There wasn't much, just a bunch of unhelpful science equipment, a few basic tools, some shovels, and some extra fuel cans which were thankfully full. I tossed all the science equipment out of the back into the snow and tried to make the inside of the camper look as civilian as I could. There were still beds and basic living amenities in there under all the research stuff so I was hopeful I could make it look like just an ordinary truck camper. I then set to work peeling off the vinyl decals and truck numbers and anything else that could tie this vehicle to the facility. I also removed the patches with the facility's logo from all of the winter gear I had stolen. I needed the laptop and radar antennas for navigation but told myself I would ditch those too once I was in sight of the settlement. I had heard the Dempster Highway had been extended to Tuktoyaktuk in 2017 so it was finally connected to the rest of Canada's roads. I could drive south into British Columbia if I made it there but I had to be sure the truck couldn't be easily identified.

I was impressed with how well the truck handled the deep snow as I pushed my way towards the shoreline. I knew any minute I could get stuck and that would be the end but I kept going. It was nerve wracking pulling out on to the ice and I half expected to just immediately break through. I had seen enough Ice Road Truckers on the History Channel to know to take my seatbelt off and drive slow as to not create a pressure wave and crack the ice so I crept along barely going above 40 kilometres an hour. This was a lot different than Ice Road Truckers though. Ice roads are actually maintained it's not like they're just driving on untamed ice, like I was doing right now. It was bumpy and the I could hear the ice shifting and cracking under me as I crossed over the uneven sections. I was sure I was going to break through but after about 2 hours of driving over the uneven ice I saw the lights of Tuktoyaktuk in the distance. I stopped the truck and climbed onto the roof and ripped off the radar antenna then tore out the laptop mount from the cab and took off towards the town. I contemplated going to the locals for help but figured that would only get me arrested so I only stopped briefly for fuel then took off down the long lonely highway headed south. Bob, the guy who ran the gas station was confused as he hadn't seen me come to town but didn't ask too many questions.

I only made one other stop in Inuvik for more fuel but besides that I made it pretty much all the way to Whitehorse in the Yukon in one go. By this point I had been on the road for almost 24 hours straight and was exhausted and needed to rest. I decided to ditch the truck just outside Whitehorse and walk into town and find a room for the night posing as a tourist. Whitehorse had an airport and I could fly home from there the next day. I found an old logging road to hide the truck down. I contemplated setting it on fire but I knew that would draw too much attention so I just abandoned it in the trees, gathered my things and made the hour walk into Whitehorse. My night at the bed and breakfast there was the best sleep I had had in days but sadly I was woken up early the next morning by my phone ringing. I had forgotten I'd even had a phone since over the past few days it had been all but useless to me.

"Hello?" I sad groggily into the phone. "Mr. Richards this is Sargeant Powell with the Ontario Provincial Police we have been trying to reach you for the past 2 days." Said the voice on the other end of the phone. I immediately stiffened up. "What for?" I asked, assuming I had been reported missing. "About the accident you caused at the interchange of the 404 and the 401 on Monday, you rear ended a dump truck and then swerved into the other lane where your car was rear ended by a minivan causing a 50 car pileup. 11 people are dead and many more were injured. We could not locate you at the accident so you have been presumed to have fled the scene on foot which is a very serious offence." The officer continued. I had almost forgotten that I had been driving to work before all this started. Part of me thought that maybe I had lost some memory or something but from what the cop was telling me it seemed like I had, no that's crazy... There's no way I somehow teleported from the GTA to the Canadian Arctic... But then again that did seem to be what had happened... "Well I certainly hope you have the wrong person officer," I said into the phone trying to regain my composure. "You see, I'm in Whitehorse in the Yukon right now, visiting my aunt," obviously I was not going to tell him why I was really up there, "so if my car was involved in an accident then it must've been stolen." "Is that so Mr.Richards," the cop said in a tone that I could tell meant he didn't believe me. "Well if you have any proof of this I'm going to need it as soon as you return."

Upon landing at Toronto Pearson Airport I was immediately taken into custody by the police. They did not believe my story of visiting my aunt in the Yukon at all but had to led me go as it was a pretty rock solid alibi and all the receipts from my stay there and my flight home. I just claimed I lost my ticket for the flight there. After my release I fully expected my house to get raided by the SWAT team or something and I'd be hauled in for questioning about my involement in whatever happened at the mysterious base but nothing ever came of it. It seemed the police were really only interested in the car accident and the higher levels of government had no idea I'd ever been up there. My insurance reluctantly paid for a new car and everything went back to more or less normal. Somehow my job didn't even notice I was gone so I still got paid for those days and went back to work as if nothing had happened.

The only problem is, now I know that crazy stuff like this is possible. I don't know what the government was messing around with up there or what happened to all the people at that base, and I'm not sure I want to know. Either way knowing that it's possible to just get plucked out of existence and reappear in another place entirely often leaves me sitting awake late at night wondering if and when it might happen again.
