I wrote down my experiences yesterday, and find myself in a strange predicament now. After I heard the bell for the first time, my mind has been playing tricks on me. I am experiencing a phenomena I have never experienced before. 

I have reached my house, but I know I can’t remain here long. I’ve been running on instincts from the moment I heard the bell. That wretched bell has forced me into a position of hiding.  I’m not sure how I know that, but I just know. 

I am rushing, stuffing items away into a backpack. I grabbed spare clothes, food, and some knives I had in the kitchen. I need to find proper weapons; I know they are coming for me. My breath remains calm despite my racing heart, and I feel like I am only an observer in my own body. I should explain some things. 

After I heard the bell, my body became incredibly weak for a few seconds. I almost didn’t believe it when I first heard it. It was soft, quiet, and if I wasn’t paying attention, I feel I would have missed it entirely. Although, after the first few seconds, it felt like the bell rang deep in my mind, in my bones, and through my entire body. 

Now, I’m not entirely sure how to explain being only an observer. I am so aware of myself; I almost feel separate from myself. My mind and my body are not one entity. I am my mind, and my body is an object I control. 

Then, came an immense calm and uncanny sense of knowledge. I became keenly aware of myself, my surroundings, and couldn’t shake the overwhelming sense of impending doom. I knew, somehow, what needed to be done. I bolted after that. 

I am almost finished with packing my items when I hear an almost inaudible click in the hallway. I slowly put the backpack onto my back, and turn toward the slightly cracked door of my bedroom. 

*They’re here.* 

The voice startles me. My internal monologue? Is this because of the bell? Am I able to externalize my instincts into words? Questions race through me but I continue to react instinctively. I crouch down, calculating every small movement my body makes. I can hear quiet voices outside my house, on the east wall of my bedroom. 

“ST637 is confirmed to be inside the residence,” a man whispers. 

“You must capture it, it is imperative that we do not allow it to escape,” a man’s voice comes softly through a radio. 

*It? Is that how you perceive me?* 

What is this? I feel a weight in my body I haven’t felt before, and I shutter, but my body remains calm. Is someone here? My thoughts start to move faster. 

*Focus* 

I feel a jolt in my chest, and turn my head in every direction. The weight is gone. I calm down, and I breathe quickly before focusing my attention back to the men outside. I recognize the voice on the other side of the radio. Howell. Howell has been my boss since I started my job. 

I hear the faint click in the hallway again. I press my bare feet into the floor: six men. All standing against the north wall of the hall, weighing anywhere from 220-260 pounds. 

*Easy, they’ll be coming in on the blind side of the door.*

Stop. My hands tremble for only a second before returning to a fixed state, and I begin moving carefully to the west wall, and listen for their footsteps. My mind protests but my body moves. I start to panic, but my hands don’t show the slightest shake anymore. 

*They are moving with caution, I will hand that to them, but it’s not like they stand a chance when I already know where they are.* 

What is happening to me? My brain feels foggy suddenly, and I begin to panic. Despite this sinking feeling in my chest, my body never reacts, and I continue to listen. The fear builds up in my mind, and I want to say something, but I don’t. 

“They will not enter the room at the same time,” Howell commands on the radio. 

*Perfect.* 

“Of course not, Sir,” The young man replies. 

I can hear at least four of them on the east wall. I suppose that would mean they probably have my house surrounded, making the roof my best getaway. 

The first of six men comes to the entrance, and I can feel his heart racing. He is horrified, and I’m sure Howell hasn’t told him what he’s up against. I’m not even entirely sure what he’s up against, but I react with extreme precision.

My body moves gracefully, perfectly, and accurately. I glide behind the man who’s decided he will be the first to enter. Whether he did that by choice or not is not my concern. I reach up and grab his mouth, my other hand sliding across and gripping his chin. I twist sharply, and lower him gently to the ground. 

I wait for the next men to enter, and dispose of them quickly as well. They enter quickly one after the next, and they are met with my smooth hands around their faces before meeting their end. The last of the six men was taller, which forced me to change my method. 

Upon his entry, I wrapped my arms around his torso, and flip to wrap my legs around his neck. His death would take longer than the others, but he made no sounds. 

I stand up, and begin moving down the hall. The stairwell was just around the living room, and if I made it to the upper floor, I could get onto the roof. I press my feet into the floor once again; Nobody is here. 

I move quickly through the house and onto the roof. Everything is just a reaction.  I can hear the party of men surrounding my home. They have good cover, I suppose. The entire property is surrounded by trees. 

I am crouched on the rooftop. Suddenly, I feel a burning sensation throughout my entire body. I am paralyzed, incapable of reacting despite all of my internal protests. In my mind, I am screaming, thrashing and begging for this feeling to stop. My body doesn’t move an inch. All I have done is react to the world around me, but I don’t feel like I am doing anything. 

I hear the strange voice again. 

*I’m coming for you Howell.*
