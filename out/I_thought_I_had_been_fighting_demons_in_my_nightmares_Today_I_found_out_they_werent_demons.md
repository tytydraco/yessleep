I had struggled with insomnia for years. No matter what I tried—pills, meditation, even exhausting myself with long runs—I couldn’t sleep. My mind refused to shut off. Every night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, waiting for morning.

Then a friend suggested a herbal drink. “It worked for me,” she said. I was desperate, so I gave it a shot.

That night, I finally slept.

But with sleep came nightmares.

I was standing naked on an empty street. The air was cold, making my skin prickle. Streetlights flickered, casting long, uneasy shadows. The city was silent, but I had the overwhelming feeling that I wasn’t alone. Then I saw them.

At first, they were just shapes in the distance—hunched figures watching from the dark. Their eyes glowed dimly, and they made strange noises. My heart pounded. Then one of them moved. Another followed. Before I could react, some were running straight at me.

I ran. I didn’t know where, just that I had to. The street stretched endlessly, twisting into a maze. No matter how fast I ran, they got closer. Their breathing was heavy, their footsteps pounding behind me. Just as I felt one of them reach for me—

I woke up.

Sweat drenched my sheets. My chest heaved. I sat there in the dark, trying to convince myself it wasn’t real.

The next day, I tried to forget. I distracted myself, watched happy things, told myself it was just a dream. But the moment I fell asleep, I was back on that street. Naked. Alone. And they were waiting.

It happened again the next night. And the night after that.

I skipped the herbal drink, but without it, the insomnia returned. The nightmares were terrifying, but at least I was sleeping. So I made a choice: endure the nightmares or stay awake forever.

Then, one night, everything changed.

This time, I couldn’t outrun them. One of them grabbed me. Its grip was ice-cold, its breath hot and rotten against my skin. I thrashed and kicked, desperate to break free. That’s when something fell from its body—a small, sharp razor.

Without thinking, I grabbed it. The demon lunged at me, and in a panic, I swung the blade wildly. It slashed across its head, slicing its ear clean off.

The creature let out a terrible, shrieking wail and stumbled back. The others froze. Then, as if some invisible force pulled them, they turned and ran.

I had found their weakness.

The next night, I didn’t run. I waited. The demons hesitated, shifting nervously. When one finally dared to attack, I struck first, slicing off its ear. The others scattered in fear.

And I liked it.

At first, it was just a way to fight back. But soon, I started looking forward to it. The rush of the hunt. The thrill of watching them cower and flee. Every night, I prowled the streets of my nightmare, searching for demons. It felt good.

Then today, while cleaning my closet, I found a box on the top shelf.

It was heavier than I expected. Dried blood stained the wood.

My stomach tightened, but curiosity won. I set it on the floor and lifted the lid.

Inside, neatly arranged in rows, were ears.

Not blackened demon ears.

Human ears. Some fresh. Some rotting.

I stared at them, my breath caught in my throat. My hands trembled.

I thought I had been hunting demons in my nightmares.

Today, I found out they weren’t demons—just normal humans.
