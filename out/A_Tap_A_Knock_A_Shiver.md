I never considered myself to be the superstitious type; I always thought that I was pretty level-headed and logical. For this exact reason, I did not believe in the supernatural or paranormal, or whatever it is that you call ghosts and ghoulish things of that nature. With that said, life has a funny way of challenging all of your beliefs, and even the strongest of convictions can run aground once in contact with the reality that one’s own senses perceive. I still don’t know what I saw, or I suppose “heard” would be the more appropriate term. Even so, my experience has left me baffled.



It started with tapping - that damnable, incessant tapping. At first, quiet, nearly imperceptible, like a leaky faucet or a crack in the wall of a dam. I’d hear it late at night as I lie down to rest.  


*Tap… Tap… Tap…*



In the walls. Discreet, inconspicuous, unobtrusive - all in high contrast to the Hell that the sound would herald. I once believed - foolishly - that the taps were simply the groaning of a settling house. An aching cry produced by an architectural creation whose own life predates mine. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing to concern myself with or even note. It is only now with the gift of hindsight that I am able to see that this is where my torment truly began. 	Next came the scratching. Light, yet irritating, as if the work of some infernal rodent who found its way between the boards and insulation. Scurrying, the sound of nails on wood. Rummaging and nesting in the walls of my home. I imagined that it must be a squirrel, or perhaps a family of mice. The squeaking that accompanied the newfound nuisance certainly contributed to this line of thought. This all seemed innocent enough, albeit annoying. I didn’t enjoy hearing the scuffling as I tried to sleep, but the noisiness was otherwise harmless.



*Knock*



*Strange. Not incredibly loud. Muffled as if someone set down a glass on a wooden table too quickly. An unexpected noise, but I was too tired to care at the time.*



*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*



I’m jolted awake. Upright in bed and frantically searching in the dark. *Is someone at the door? No, that can’t be right. It’s well past 3 in the morning. Besides, it sounded too close to be my front door.* 



*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*



This time I’m startled to my feet. There can be no doubt of where the banging came from, and yet it makes no sense. *I live on the second floor. How is it behind me? There’s nothing on the other side of that wall but open air.*	I stood cautiously in the dark for what felt like an eternity. I waited for 5 minutes - maybe 10 - I can’t be sure. Adrenaline tends to have an effect on one’s perception of time. However long I waited, I did not hear anything. Not a knock, not a scratch, not even a tap or creak. Silence. Peace. I slept soundly until morning.



*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*



The following night was more of the same. Loud, angry slamming, then silence once I fully awoke. The pattern continued for three nights, and on the fourth the knocking persisted. I no longer slept through the full night. Now, every time I dozed off I was abruptly roused from my slumber no more than 15 minutes later. I was deprived of sleep - irritable and disgruntled. My work suffered, my social life gradually disappeared as I was too exhausted to go out anywhere. I was a wreck. Even when I tried to sleep in a different area of my house the noise followed me. There was no sanctuary for me in my own home. Despite what I had been through, all pales in comparison to the last night that I spent in that accursed abode.



I awoke, drenched in sweat, not to a sound this time. Looking back on the event now, I realize that all was silent. Well, almost all. The sole noise was that of raspy breathing. A wheezing exhale, followed by a wretched gurgling inhale. I attempt to roll over to see the source of the disturbing respiration. Instead, I experience a brand new horror. I’m unable to move. My limbs are frozen in place and my eyes are locked on the wall in front of me. I know something is there, but I can’t see it, no matter how hard I try to break out of my Catatonia.



I feel a cold chill and icy breath on the back of my neck. It’s so close to me that the wet aspiration is mingling with my sweat, and the smell of decay is sickening. I will my body to move, I beg for it to, but it won’t obey. The only response I get is an intense, uncontrollable shivering that overtakes my entire body. I close my eyes and pray. This feels like it could be the end for me, and I don’t even get to see what my assailant looks like - not that its appearance would put me at ease. The horrid noises that the wretch produces would be deafening at this point, had the pounding of my own heart not threatened to take my hearing first.



Despair. Agony. Complete and utter hopelessness. I sincerely hope none of you reading experience these emotions with the same severity that I did in that moment. I truly believed that my time had come, and though I was not ready I was still being forced to meet the moment head on. Those were the thoughts that raced through my mind, until…



*KNOCK…KNOCK…KNOCK…*



Slow, deliberate, ear-shattering. The sound reverberated through my room and echoed in my skull. I then suddenly felt my limbs loosen. Whatever diabolic spell had held me there had been released. I sprang up out of bed and ran straight out of the door.



I have not been back to that loathsome house since, not even to retrieve my belongings. I hired movers and found a new place to stay for the time being. I have no desire to return, even if that home has been in my family for generations. As far as I’m concerned, that detestable estate belongs to that *thing*, and I do not wish to be given a second warning to stay out.
