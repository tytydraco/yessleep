Hey everyone, I don't know where else to turn. Something horrifying is happening to my sister, Samantha, and I'm scared out of my mind.

It all started a few weeks ago when Samantha returned from a camping trip in the woods. She seemed fine at first, but then she began complaining about intense itching all over her body. At first, we thought it was just a bad case of poison ivy from the trip, but it's gotten so much worse.

Her skin is raw from scratching, and she's become incredibly sensitive to light. Deep welts cover her arms and legs, some of them oozing with pus and blood from her incessant scratching. No amount of soothing creams or medications seems to alleviate her agony.

But that's not even the worst part.

In addition to the itching and sensitivity to light, Samantha's eyes have taken on a sickeningly yellow tinge, giving her gaze a strange quality. She often complains of seeing strange shapes and shadows darting around in her peripheral vision, and her once vibrant eyes now seem sunken and hollow, as if some unseen force is draining the life from within her.

Her mood swings have become a rollercoaster of emotions, ranging from intense rage to inconsolable despair in the blink of an eye. One moment she's laughing and joking, the next she's lashing out at anyone who dares to come near her. It's like she's trapped in a constant battle with herself, and we're all caught in the crossfire.

But it doesn't stop there. Strange things have been happening around her. The neighbor's dogs keep barking incessantly whenever she speaks, as if they sense something sinister lurking beneath the surface. And I swear I've seen shadows moving in the corners of my vision when she's nearby.

A few days ago, when she was still coherent, we decided to do some research together, and what we found... well, I don't know what to believe, but apparently the symptoms she's experiencing match up with those of a skinwalker.

As I asked her more and more questions about her trip, I discovered that Samantha had stumbled upon an abandoned house. She'd found an old journal hidden in the attic there, filled with strange drawings and cryptic symbols. Samantha was always fascinated by urban exploration and the occult, so she took the journal back to camp with her. She said she fell asleep with the journal in her arms, and when she woke up the next morning, it was gone.

The situation has escalated to the point where we've had to tie her down. Samantha's unpredictable outbursts and alarming behavior has forced our hands. It was a heartbreaking decision, but we had no choice â€“ our own lives are at stake, and we can't risk Samantha causing harm to herself or others.

Even now, as I sit here writing this, I can hear her muffled cries from the other room, and my heart breaks knowing that it has come to this.

If anyone has any advice, please, we could really use some help right now.
