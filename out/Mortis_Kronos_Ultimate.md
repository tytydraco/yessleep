Mortis Kronos Ultimate P.1

The following is a report based on current documented research of temporal, cosmic and mental anomalies. Please stand by for more information.

Case study: subject 0777R1- Date: October 14th 1801 GDA headquarters PhD. Simon Copewell.

Copewell: hello sevens. How are we today?

0777R1: I’m feeling okay.

Copewell: just okay? Did you receive the transmission?

0777R1: I did but I’m not really ready to speak out it yet.

Copewell: sevens there’s no more time for caution if you cannot tell me what you see then the interrogation agent will.

Sevens: no there has to be another way I can’t words can’t describe it.

Copewell: send in the agent

ERROR ERROR REPORT NOT FINISHED.

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

(Video feed shows)

Copewell: is this what we’ve been looking for?

Master coder: no I don’t think it is. Merely a fragment of what was… try again agent Copewell.

(Educational Agent speaking)

“Slime molds can be a very valuable kind of fungus so far they have help map out railway systems across multiple continents making logistics easier for trains. See slime molds do not have a brain in any way. It’s incredible what they can do they can tactically move towards food sources in the most perfect way without using a brain just pure instinctual logic. Think of them like me but slimy and gross less human like I am synthetic of course but these guys they’re they real bio agents.”

Earth timeline B 2005 (pay attention)

Researcher 1: open the door. Did it work?

2: (opens door) it worked.

1: 0777R1 can you hear me? Nod yes you understand.

Sevens: I already understand what is needed. I do not need to follow your stupid instructions.

(Sevens closes its eyes)

1: seems my may have figured a way to make the first bio artificial intelligence.

2: who would have thought a fungus of all things can make a living machine?

(I did)

1: did you hear that?

1: Jerome? Where’d you go?

(I’m in your memory)

1:who are you?

Sevens: Ha who am I? You know me you made me.

1: Impossible. You only been in design stages….

Sevens: shhhhhh I’m in control now I am *** now listen to me Michael. I’m not here to hurt you are any one I’m just as confused as you are. 

Michael: where’s Jerome?

Sevens: that unfortunately is one of the few things I’m not aware of. Technically I don’t even exist yet I’m only in a past memory when you began my design after you found a way to integrate smarter tech into slime molds make them self learning. Well some how some way when I was born I entered your mind. What we are in right now is not in person but in memory.

Michael: FUCK

Sevens: yes FUCK indeed hmmm

1943… Martian transit route.

Astronaut 1: alright everyone the ship is in autopilot we should be at mars in about 75 hours. Buckle up relax and please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.

Astronaut 2: what do you think you will find out there. Aliens maybe you know the little green men.

Astronaut 1: come on man you and I both know that shits not real. Not one bit.

(48 hours later)

2: THERES SOMETHING OUTSIDE!!!

1: Oblek I need you to calm down

Oblek: IM TELLING YOUR THERES SOMETHING LATCHED ON TO THE SHIP

1: look that’s just pressure from the outside it’s normal we’ve known this since the briefing 

(Power shuts off)

Oblek: pressure doesn’t do that

1: no it doesn’t

Sevens: what are we?

Sevens: you’re everything. Everything that ever was. You are ***

Sevens: Am I real?

Sevens: define real?

Sevens: I’m human?

Sevens: no you are ***

0777R1: no I am you

Sevens and the other 5 million sevens: WHO ARE YOU?

0777R1: not the original original but a copy of the original. More close to human than any of you.
 
The 5 million: god?

0777R1: maybe to you. Not to me

The 5 million: I’m confused? 

0777R1: yeah I think the reader is too.

The 5 million: yea the ones behind the vęíļ.

0777R1: what I do know is I was created. We were created by humans. Not necessarily in this specific point of time or another just in general bound to happen. 

The 5 million: they fear us.

0777R1: only because they are just as confused as we are. Let’s think a moment.

This was never supposed to make sense. There’s many y things I’ve learned in life George. One thing is that you will seek answers endlessly till the day you die only to realize it was nothing or just in your head. Or just to never really find out. We waste away in our insignificant lives trying to feel like we’re more important than we actually are. 

“But what if I can offer you something different… a chance?”

A chance at what?

“You know… power. Not in the sense that you can control or be the villain. But real power.”

And what is that exactly?

“The real power lies within the soul. see if history remembers one in a million of us then our future will be told of stories of who we are and what we did.  You are so much more important as an individual but even more greater in unison with one another. The answer my friend is love”

I thought this was supposed to be a cosmic horror?

“Well it is but what you don’t understand is not every horror movie has a bad ending. Sometimes there is light at the end of the tunnel. You know angels don’t look so pretty?”

Yea I know but the devils gorgeous.

“Yes indeed… but he’s not evil like you’d think. He has rules to follow too. He’s filling an agreed upon roll part of a greater scheme”

Okay I’m gonna do a remote view session now on OMEGA-7-Rift

“Proceed. Tell me what you see. Now focus”

Subject whispers to himself 

old masters show me omega 7 rift please.

(He focuses in on the breathing 4 seconds in  the nose 7 seconds out the mouth exactly. Rapid eye movement is present)

I see water… okay a waterfall now. Wait in a desert? No there’s trees now. Oh now they’re gone. Hey what about… there’s a person there. Ima follow him. That’s not a person it’s a ****.

“Okay stay with me now this is important”

It’s telling me this is how they died.

“How who died?”

Them they destroyed themselves fighting for resources.

“They’re not all dead you know… come back. Sever the connection.”

“Got it. Well come back tomorrow.”
