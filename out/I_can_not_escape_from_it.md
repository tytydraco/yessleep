As I lay in bed, trying to fall asleep, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me. I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just my imagination, but the feeling only grew stronger. I slowly sat up, looking around my dark room. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but I could still feel eyes on me. I decided to get up and turn on the light, hoping that would dispel the eerie feeling. 

As I reached for the light switch, I heard a faint whisper in my ear. "Don't turn on the light," it hissed. "You don't want to see what's in here with you." My heart pounded in my chest as I hesitated, my hand trembling above the switch. Part of me wanted to turn on the light and face whatever was lurking in the darkness, but another part of me was terrified of what I might find. I took a deep breath and mustered up all my courage. I flicked on the light, and to my horror, I saw the figure from my nightmares standing in the corner of the room.

It was tall and thin, with pale skin and dark, empty eyes. It stared at me with a wicked grin, its elongated fingers twitching with anticipation. I tried to scream, but no sound escaped my lips. I was frozen with fear, unable to move or speak. The figure began to move towards me, its footsteps echoing in the silence of the room. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for the worst. But instead of feeling the creature's touch, I heard a loud crash and felt a gust of wind. I opened my eyes and saw that the window had been shattered, and the figure was gone. I didn't know how it had escaped, or why it had chosen to spare me. All I knew was that I needed to get out of that room immediately.

I grabbed my things and ran out of the house, not stopping until I reached the safety of my friend's house. As soon as I arrived at my friend's house, I called the police and told them what had happened. They came to my house and searched it, but they didn't find anything out of the ordinary. They even checked the window, but there was no sign of the broken glass or the figure that had escaped through it. They told me it was safe to return to my house, but I was still too scared to stay there. I decided to stay with my friend for a few more days until I felt ready to go back.

When I finally returned to my house, I was nervous but determined to face my fears. I went to bed, determined to get a good night's sleep. But as I lay there, trying to drift off, I felt that familiar feeling of being watched. I opened my eyes and saw the figure standing at the foot of my bed, its dark eyes fixed on me.

"You can't escape me," it whispered.

I tried to scream, but once again, no sound escaped my lips. The figure reached out and touched my face, and I felt a sudden, overwhelming sense of dread.

As I lay there, paralyzed with fear, I realized that the figure was not just some random monster. It was a manifestation of my own fears and anxieties, brought to life by my own mind. No matter where I go, it will always be there with me, no matter how fast I run, it will always catch up.

I can not escape from it.
