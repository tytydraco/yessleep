[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1haqk26/theres_something_outside_my_window_and_it_knows/)

It’s been a few days, and I’m still alive. The pressure hasn’t been alleviated, I still feel like there’s someone holding a knife raised to the back of my neck mere inches behind me at all times, but I’ve had to continue operating like everything is normal. As of yet, I have no evidence to present to anyone concerning the tangibility of this thing’s existence, and on the chance that I can come out on the other side of this alive, I’d rather not have people questioning my sanity or forcing me into some kind of ‘help.’ Thus, I have resigned myself to the fact that I must live life relatively normally, at least for the time being.

It was really tempting at first to have some dramatic conversations with my family, get in some final goodbyes or parting sentiments, but I held myself back from doing so. The lack of physical harm or any other particularly negative event happening gave me hope that perhaps I wasn’t in immediate danger... but that’s more than likely wishful thinking on my part.

To be honest, I’ve been pretty bipolar on whether or not I am literally insane, which has added to my hesitancy of taking any sort of proactive action. Sometimes, during the day, I’m able to convince myself that I’m just a little mentally unwell, but when night falls, I instantly become a vehement believer that a supernatural or an otherwise otherworldly presence has attached itself to me. I was about ready to fully commit to the angle that my mind is slipping, as I found that alternative to be far less horrifying, when the worst possible scenario for my attempted ignorant bliss occurred: I had another direct encounter with the being, this time leagues more blatant than the window tapping and telepathy I experienced a few nights before. To make matters worse, it was during the day with all the lights on.

It happened in the shower.

Thanks to a pretty optimal finals schedule, I didn’t have to show up to campus on either Monday or Tuesday, and as such, I was taking advantage of showering at home during a weekday, instead of having to use the dorm-room shower that felt dirty even with sandals on. Since things concerning my ‘haunting,’ if you want to call it that, had calmed down in comparison my first encounter (and as said earlier, I was in the midst of gaslighting myself into thinking none of it was *actually* real), I didn’t really have the thought of the being on my mind when I discovered I had the house to myself. My sister was at school, both my parents at work, and I had been the only one allowed the luxury of sleeping in.

The familiar paranoia only began to set in once I had made my way into the bathroom, closing both the main door and shower door only to realize just how isolated I now felt. Our bathroom was small, just a typical square space taken up by a toilet, sink, and shower. I would sometimes imagine what I would do if the house was under some sort of attack, whether it be robbery or a murderous psycho, and I was in the middle of taking a shower. Being naked and comfortable in hot water was one of the most vulnerable positions a person could be in, and I would be especially doomed if a malicious assailant cornered me *in* the bathroom whilst I was in the middle of enjoying a shower.

I miss the days when I concerned myself with dangers grounded in sensible reality, got myself a little worked up over improbable scenarios that technically *could* happen. Now, as I stood alone in the quiet room, the silence only broken by the steaming hot water cascading down onto me, thoughts of an unseen entity from another realm dominated my mind.

It started with the realization that I was utterly alone. Not only was no one else home, but anyone that would look for me should something bad happen were hours away from noticing. Furthermore, I was standing in a closed room with one exit, inside of a container surrounded by glass in that room, on top of everything else. I was very contained and very alone. If anything wanted me dead, now would be the perfect time to strike.

This realization is what prompted the fear to flow through the floodgates and once again envelop my conscience. My breaths began to speed up, to grow heavier as I stared intently at the door that served as the exit and entrance to the bathroom, imagining that just beyond its flimsy frame was the being, waiting for me to let my guard down.

I forced myself to look away; this was the window situation all over again. Obsessing over an outlet to the broader world and convincing myself that something incapable of being understood waited just beyond its borders, harboring nothing but malicious intent. As horrifying as the thought of washing my hair currently was, the idea of closing my eyes and depriving myself of a vital sensory capability while being in such a vulnerable position sounding like a death sentence, I decided I needed to force myself into such an uncomfortable action. Even if something did happen, even if the being made a move while I wasn’t paying attention, then at least I would know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I wasn’t crazy. Besides, what would the difference really be? If I was attacked by a supernatural entity with my guard down or up, I had a feeling the end result would be the same.

Sucking in a deep breath of the steamy air around me, I steeled over my nerves and closed my eyes as I ducked my head into the heat of the steady fall of water. As per usual, I raised my hands to my head and ran my fingers through my thick brown hair as the water drenched it. I could feel my heart beating in my chest as I failed to think of anything but the entity being in the room with me. Deciding I couldn’t take the suspense of my vision being obscured any longer, I threw open my eyes, feeling the sting of water droplets leaping into them, blurrily keeping an eye on the closed door through the corners of my vision.

I should have felt relief upon seeing that the space beyond my shower remained as peaceful as ever. The door was still faithfully shut and locked, nothing was disturbed. The fact that I felt no release in the build up of pressure that was threatening to consume my entire body unsettled me greatly; as such, I decided that I had washed myself thoroughly enough for the day, and it was time to get somewhere less secluded.

As I took a step back, every nerve in my body screamed at once as my muscles seemed to freeze in place.

I had bumped into something standing directly behind me.

The bare skin of my back was now pressed against something smooth, almost slippery due to how flawlessly devoid of any kind of ridges or friction the mass possessed.

*“Would you be willing to trade your life in place of another?”* It’s ghastly, whispery thoughts slipped into my mind as I felt a pair of impossibly smooth hands gently take hold of my shoulders.

Up to this point I had been experiencing shock and panic on a level I had never even so much as neared before, consequently freezing entirely. But now, as the sheer reality of what was happening set in, I panicked in a much different way.

Letting out a scream that was far more real than anything that had escaped my throat before, I lunged forward, crashing into the head of the shower and stumbling back, slipping on the wet floor and landing on my rear. Adrenaline overtaking the pain, I scrambled backward while twisting around, sitting naked and shaking with fear as my back pressed against the front of the shower.

Nothing was in front of me. All that lay ahead was the rest of the empty shower.

I blinked as water continued to cascade down my face, heart racing. As with every other instance, after remaining still and engaging in calming breaths, the panic began to fade back into a place where I could manage to shakily climb to my feet.

There was no denying it anymore. I had made physical contact with it. Something really was stalking me, something that could not be explained by any manner of logic or rationale.

Its telepathic words are still ringing in my head.

*“Would you be willing to trade your life in place of another?”*

I don’t know if my initial instincts were wrong or right anymore. That would have been its perfect chance to kill me if it wanted me dead, and now it had presented me with a second question of a philosophical nature instead of making any sort of proper move against me. Not very indicative of something out to take my life, and if it *was* simply toying with me before my execution… why not get a little more fun out of me? Why barely appear at all? Did it thrive off my daily paranoia and nightly panic attacks ever since it first ‘appeared’ to me? Am I going to die soon or not? Is it going to *kill* me or not?

I guess my real question is should I be saying my goodbyes or not.

I’m too conscious about my public image to get mental help and I’m too distrusting to seek any sort of ‘supernatural expert’ for help either, so whatever the answers to my questions are, I suppose I’ll have to discover them on my own. As long as I keep surviving these ordeals, I’ll keep updating my account concerning this bizarre situation I find myself in.

At least I know now. There really *is* something more out there, some force of the beyond that may be outside of human understanding completely. I don’t know how many more encounters I can survive before my mind really *does* snap, though. I’m already exhausted, feeling only half-alive during the day hours due to what little sleep I get at night. I’m experiencing that feeling of being watched almost all day now, but its strength seems to increase by tenfold during the night.

Speaking of, I think I’ll head to bed immediately after posting this. Maybe I can get some better sleep if I attempt it while daylight is still around.
