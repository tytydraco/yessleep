I never considered myself superstitious. I grew up in a pragmatic household where ghosts were mere figments of imagination fueled by horror movies and tales spun by anxious parents. But as I sit here, trembling while recounting my experience, I can no longer dismiss what happened that night. 

It started innocuously enough. A weekend trip to my uncle's old house in the woods for a little family reunion. The house had been in our family for generations, standing lonely at the end of a long dirt road, surrounded by looming pines and the occasional eye of a curious deer. My uncle, a retired history professor, had filled his home with relics and artifacts collected over decades, each with a story that made the air thick with nostalgia. 

On Saturday night, after the adults had enjoyed their share of wine and stories, the atmosphere shifted. Shadows stretched as if eager to engulf the corners of the room. The group began regaling each other with urban legends and local folklore, tales that seeped fear into the unwary hearts of listeners. That’s when my cousin, Alison, a few years younger than I, leaned in close and whispered about the "Hollow Eyed Woman" a spirit said to haunt the woods surrounding the house. 

“People say she appears if you wander too far,” she murmured. “They say she tries to lure you away, promising you secrets. But if you listen to her, you’re never seen again.” 

Of course, being the eldest (and, in my mind, the most rational), I scoffed and dismissed her tales, but Alison’s eyes sparkled with a fervor that was unsettling. I merely smiled, ruffled her hair, and told her she was being dramatic. The adults moved on, oblivious to the rare chill that had started to settle over me.

After the night wound down and everyone retired, I felt restless. Sleep eluded me, and the atmosphere of the quiet, old house took on a weight that pressed against my chest. I crept to the bathroom, the only source of light coming from a half broken bulb in the hallway. As I returned to my room, I heard a strange noise outside a soft, beckoning voice drifting through the open window like a distant echo. 

Curiosity gnawing at me, I decided to investigate. With every step toward the back door, the floorboards creaked beneath me like the moans of the house itself, growing impatient at this breach of silence. I stepped out onto the back porch, clutching my thick sweater around me as the cool night air bit at my skin.

I squinted into the darkness, trying to pierce the veil of shadows, and that’s when I heard it again a whisper, soft and almost melodic. It drifted from the tree line, weaving through the branches the unmistakable call of a woman’s voice. 

“Come here…” 

I hesitated, aware of the warnings refracting back into my mind. But the allure was strong. It felt wrong to indulge in my curiosity, yet I stepped off the porch and into the garden. The moonlight filtered through the canopy of trees, illuminating an uneven path curling deeper into the woods. That voice how it coiled around my thoughts. It felt like an invitation, perhaps a puzzle waiting to be solved.

The deeper I walked, the more the trees closed in around me, the air enveloping me in stillness that was heavier than before. I called out, trying to make sense of the silence, but all that echoed back was the creaking of branches and a rustle of leaves. Just as panic began to wiggle into my chest, I caught sight of something in the distance a pale shape among the dark trunks, a drifting figure. 

My heart raced. Maybe I was imagining it. Maybe this was just a childish ghost story taking root in my mind. But there she stood, a woman dressed in a flowing white gown, long hair cascading over her shoulders. Just beyond her hideous, hollow cheeked face were two deep, sunken eyes that seemed to swallow all light. 

“Come closer…” The voice was no longer warm; it was a low, rasping sigh, like dead leaves stirring. I did not move. 

Every instinct screamed to retreat, yet there was something in her gaze a hollow promise that I was desperate to understand. “I know what you seek. I can show you everything,” she beckoned, extending a skeletal hand toward me. 

In that moment, the fear that had gripped my insides twisted into something worse a crushing sorrow. I felt as though she were unearthing every remorseful thought I had ever buried, every secret I wished remained undiscovered. Every shameful moment surfaced as I was drawn closer against my will. The chill of the night wrapped tightly around me, each breath pulling me further into her abyss.

“Please, just a glimpse,” I found myself pleading, but whether it was for her favor or my own solace, I could not tell anymore.

I took a cautious step forward, a branch snapping beneath my foot, and she turned sharply, her hollow eyes locking onto mine with a feral intensity. “Follow” she whispered, and again, I was compelled, stumbling after her. I moved deeper into the woods, the underbrush clawing at my legs, the sounds of the night fading as I ventured further into the darkness.

But then, in an instant, she turned toward me, her expression shifting into something I dared not comprehend. “Now now you’re mine,” she hissed, her beauty twisting into malevolence as her figure morphed, becoming a glimmering shadow of despair. 

That’s when I realized I’d lost my bearings. I had no idea which direction led back to the house; I was trapped in a caged forest, and the laughter of the woman turned to howls as the trees closed in around me.

A fleeting terror surged within me, and I fought against the compulsion. I turned to run, heart pounding. I darted through the trees, branches scraping at my skin, but when I turned back, she was still there, the glistening darkness at my heels, her whispers morphing into screams.

I don’t know how long I ran. Minutes bled into hours, my thoughts hacked apart by panic. Finally, I broke free from the woods and collapsed onto the familiar ground of the backyard, gasping for breath. The moon hung hauntingly still above, as if it had known my struggle. 

I stood trembling at the foot of the porch stairs, terrified to look back. I rushed inside, slamming the door shut, my heart hammering to drown out the echoes that lingered in the night. 

The following morning, dawn's light revealed the chaos I had weathered. I recounted my experience to my family, but they laughed it off, attributing it to a youthful imagination running wild. I feigned a smile, heart still pounding and voice trembling, but inside, I was unmoored. 

After the family reunion, I left, but every night since, that whisper stalks my dreams, creeping through the walls, echoing in the hushed breathing of twilight. 

I can still feel their watchful gaze, the dread that lingers like a shroud, swelling within me as I lie awake. Each shadow in my room stretches and distorts into something familiar the reminder of the woman in the woods, with those hollow eyes that promised everything but betrayed me. 

Now, as the sun sets and shadows crawl back into the corners of my life, I wonder if I ever truly escaped. If perhaps, somewhere in the suffocating depths of the forest, a hollow eyed woman waits for me still ready to collect what I owe her for the secrets I was never meant to find.
