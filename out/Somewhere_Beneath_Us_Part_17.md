&#x200B;

In my shallow state of sleep, I could tell that I was starting to wake up. I fought the process, however, and kept my eyes shut, pulling Andi close and relaxing beneath her aura. She was so warm, and her breathing was so steady. Her usual rhythmic heart was beating quite fast, though, and as I breathed softly against her, I noticed her scent was also different. My half-asleep brain wrestled with the concept when, like waking up from a dream, I came crashing back to reality. Andi was dead, so who was lying on top of me? My eyes shot open, and I jolted up. The room was filled with faint blue light from the early morning hours, and everyone was still asleep. Everyone except for Bea, who had just been rudely woken up by my outburst of movement. We both looked at one another with different expressions. Mine was of confusion and guilt. The combination of exhaustion and suppressed emotions had made last night's events a blur in my mind. However, I certainly remembered enough to understand the expressions that she chose. Anger. Sadness. Relief and betrayal. The hurt in her eyes made me feel like the biggest fool on the planet. The part of her that looked relieved made me feel worse, however.

I stared at the floor, avoiding her gaze, then turned forward, resting my arms on my knees. I buried my mouth into them and stared out of the window ahead. I could have been outside of it right now if Bea hadn't stopped me, my hollow husk smiling with false joy and dancing with Hillary. Knowing I had upset Bea made me wish for that fate even more. I was better off dead to them. No one should have to care about someone like me, and I certainly didn't deserve someone like her. Someone who would notice how long I was gone for in the night and get up to look. Someone who would see that I wasn't in the house and come charging into danger after me. When I first heard her calling, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me.

"Joel!"

'Shut up.' I told my brain. I was so tired. Tired of not sleeping and tired of not being okay. I didn't want to hear voices in my head anymore. I didn't want to think at all. I wasn't about to talk myself out of this.

"Joel, what are you doing!?"

I closed my eyes and tried to drown out the voice, but when I felt a warm hand grab my arm in opposition to the cold hand holding my other one, I reopened them. Bea stood behind me, holding onto my wrist tightly with an expression of raw fear in her eyes. The sight immediately sobered me up.

"Bea- what are you, why are you-"

"No! Shut up, come on!" She pulled hard on my arm, but I didn't budge. It wasn't by choice, however.

"Oh, Hi, Beatrice! So good to see you! Have you come to join us as well?" Hillary asked.

Bea stared at her with horror, then tugged my arm again. Finally coming to my senses, I tried to assist her, but Hillary's grip was terrifyingly strong.

"Hillary, let me go," I told her.

She frowned, "But Joel, I thought you wanted to come with us? You said you wanted to come with us."

"No. I don't. I-I didn't-"

Her eyes wavered, and she looked perplexed, "But, Joel, it's so lonely… You could be so happy here. We're all so happy here." She said, gesturing to the dancing figures in the distance. Their dance was methodical and joyous, yet they often stumbled or jerked violently as if it hurt to move. "Please don't leave me. Please, Joel."

I wrenched my arm harder, trying to escape, but Hillary grabbed me with both hands, clutching me tightly. I struggled more, this time fully shoving her with my free hand. Bea followed suit, and together, I finally broke from her vice. However, once she staggered back onto the grass, her expression changed back to a smile.

"Y-you're confused, Joel! You too, Bea. We'll show you, though! We'll show you the hills!"

I backed up to Bea, who once again grabbed ahold of my arm tightly, and together we began stepping backward closer to the house. However, before we could get far, Hillary jerked herself back to her feet, legs standing fully upright before her torso could even catch up. Something we learned very quickly in the house was to know when to run. We turned to do so, and as we did, we could see all of the bodies on the horizon turn in our direction. All at once, they began to sprint toward us alarmingly fast.

"C'mon!" Bea yelled as together we took off back toward the house.

Behind us, we could hear Hillary dangerously close. Her strides were rapid and uneven as if each step wasn't calculated the same as the rest. Yet, despite this, she remained on our heels the whole way back to the porch. We flew up onto the platform without even touching any steps, and luckily Bea had left the door open when she had run out after me. I lunged inside, attempting to pull her in with me, but my body jerked back as she was stopped. Hillary had pounced forward and was currently gripping her ankle tightly.

Bea fell to the floor, her hand slipping out of mine as the crazed corpse began trying to drag her back out. Behind Hillary, all of her 'friends' were almost on the porch. Bea let out a yelp of fear before using her other foot to deliver a heavy kick to the woman's face. It was enough to loosen her grip, and I quickly reached for Bea and pulled her into safety, slamming the door and locking it before Hillary could get back up.

The other bodies piled up onto the porch like a pack of feral dogs, plowing over top of one another and trampling the woman beneath. They cocked their heads and knocked on the glass, flashing artificial smiles as if to convince us they meant no harm. Eventually, Hillary managed to worm her way out from underneath them and stood, squeezing through the group to the front. She, too, smiled at us, her lip entirely split in half on the bottom. No blood was coming out.

Bea and I crawled into the living room away from the awful sight before she looked at me and slowly broke down into sobs. Everything that had just happened suddenly caught up with me, and I felt so stupid.

"What… What the hell were you thinking, Joel?" She whispered between sobs.

I stared at her with my mouth open, ready to respond, but I couldn't get anything meaningful to come out. Nothing I said mattered. The damage was already done. "Bea, I… I don't know what I… I'm so sorry…."

She didn't respond. Watching her cry and hold herself in a desperate attempt for comfort made me feel sick, and I felt tears begin to well in my eyes. What had I done? I scooted closer to her and gently brushed my fingers to her ankle, where she had been grabbed. On her other foot, I could see that blood ran out of her heel. It seemed that one of Hillary's teeth had been a point of impact. I left Bea crying on the floor as I stood and shuffled to the bathroom. I grabbed one of the few band-aids we had and poured some alcohol from a bottle onto some toilet paper. As I went to exit, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My fingers flicked the light switch off, dispelling the awful sight.

Bea winced as I dabbed the cloth to the cut and then carefully placed the band-aid on her. She was still crying, and I just sat nearby, letting silent tears fall from my own eyes.

"I'm so sorry…." I repeated softly, over and over, hoping and praying that she would say something. I needed her to say something. Anything to stop her from crying. "Are you okay?" I said sheepishly. I couldn't believe I dared to even ask such a question.

She just shook her head and looked down at the floor as she tried to muffle her crying, "No, Joel. I'm not. I mean, I am, but you- why? Joel, why would you do that to yourself? To us? To me?"

"I… I don't know. I didn't think-"

"What? That we would miss you? That we wouldn't eventually see your corpse at that window and be devastated? That I wouldn't blame myself if you had actually-" She didn't finish the sentence before another wave of cries overtook her, each one breaking my heart a little more. I slowly reached out my hand and placed it on her shoulder, but she surprised me by fully lunging at me and locking me into a tight hug.

"Please, Joel…" She bawled into my neck, "Please don't leave me… Please… I need you so much…."

I squeezed her back tightly. "I won't, okay?" I cooed into her ear, "I was being stupid, is all. I'm right here now, and I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry…."

As I continued staring out the bedroom window and sorting my memory, I felt Bea's hand grab my arm and pull me back against the sheets. I didn't resist, and once I was lying down, she nestled herself against me, half laying on my chest. I leaned into her.

"I'm so sorry, Bea," I whispered.

She shook her head. "Shhh. Just go back to sleep. We can talk later."

I nodded and closed my eyes, relaxing beneath her aura. Her breathing and warmth were soothing, but I knew that she wasn't sleeping this close out of affection. She was just making sure I didn't try to leave again.

&#x200B;

The catwalk grates below me were hurting my chest as I lay against them, staring down into the dark abyss. I hardly noticed the pain, though. Tears streaked through the grime on my face and slipped from my skin to join in the descent downward. Down the catwalk from me, Ethan leaned against the rails that locked him in place and wept softly to himself, entirely given up on attempting to pry himself loose. I remembered that the Curator had been down the hall next to us before the encounter, and it had almost certainly heard all of the commotions, but I didn't even care at this point. Despite my indifference, however, it never came. We grieved for several minutes, and all was still. I didn't even regain the ability to think coherently until I looked up to Ethan, who was no longer crying. Instead, he looked down into the chasm with a puzzled expression, then, after a moment of thought, began trying to pry himself loose once again. I listened to his sounds of struggles before it dawned on me that I should help. I scraped myself up from the catwalk like gum from the street and shuffled over to him.

My right arm was completely useless and wouldn't move; I didn't even bother to try. Instead, I wedged myself between the bars and pushed with my back and good hand. It took a lot of effort, but eventually, the metal groaned slightly, and the bars parted just enough for Ethan to slip out. He cautiously climbed over the twisted metal, and I held onto him tightly as he did so. I wasn't risking him slipping as well. Once he landed on the catwalk, he looked up with urgency.

"You alright, man? We need to move."

I looked at him with a look of pained confusion, "Ethan… Bea; she just… She's-"

"I know. She just fell. That's why we need to move. If we hurry, we might be able to find her."

Now I was very confused. I figured that he must be in denial, "Ethan, she's not… We aren't going to find her."

"Didn't you hear what that thing said? He told Bea that her room was waiting for her."

"And? I don't know what you're getting at, Ethan. Bea's gone."

"No, Joel. She's not. I was thinking about what you said. About what *It* said. If we're getting lured into our rooms to be trapped there, why would it kill her before she even got there? That hasn't been like the last ones we've been through."

I was slowly beginning to realize that he was making a point, but I hadn't quite figured out what it was yet., "She was, though. It said it put her room at the end of the hall."

"It did, but it was also taunting us. It slipped up after, though. It said her room was waiting for her. That means this wasn't it. And if this isn't it, then that means the real one is down there." He said, pointing.

I now understood his point, but I still didn't know how that changed things. "Ethan, we didn't hear her…" my stomach churned at the thought. "We didn't hear anything hit the ground. That means that fall had to be at least a hundred stores… There's no way that she could have survived, room or not."

"But, Joel, this place has never followed any sort of logical rules. Think about all the rooms we've been through. The ballerina's, the puppets, Daniel's room. They're all meant to trap and torment, not kill. If Bea's room is down there, then that means she's trapped, and we have to go help her."

"How do you know that, though? The ballerina was the only one we've seen so far who couldn't die. I watched Larry get eaten alive, and we both saw what happened to Daniel. People have died in their rooms, Ethan."

"We don't know that Larry didn't come back like the ballerina, though. And we never fully saw what happened to Daniel."

"So, you're saying that they could still be alive?"

"Yes."

"But that's all speculation."

"That's what all of this is! We don't even know for sure if there really is an exit, yet, here we are at the bottom of a death maze still looking!"

"I never asked you to come with me!"

"I wasn't going to just let you go alone! You're my best friend, Joel! I mean, yeah, I came with you because we all heard Andi. But more so, it was because you believed that what she said was true with all your heart. And because you're my friend, of course, I was going to trust that you knew what you were doing! So please," Ethan said, dropping into a softer tone, "Trust me, Joel… Please."

I suddenly felt very small. This whole time Ethan was down here chasing something he didn't even fully believe just because I did. I couldn't help but remember what the thing masquerading as my friend had said about Ethan so long ago.

'Some people are just too loyal.'

He had been right; Ethan was too loyal to me. He was constantly looking after me and sacrificing for me, yet I hardly did anything in return.

"Okay… Yeah, of course. I trust you, brother."

Ethan nodded. "Thank you."

My doubts now aside, it finally dawned on me what Ethan had just suggested, and to be fair, it didn't seem impossible. "Wait, so if Bea is still alive, then Dan…?"

"Maybe. Like you said, it's all speculation. But right now, it's the only thing keeping me going."

"So what do we do then now? Jump down after her?" I asked.

Ethan looked over the railing and down into the endless pit. "I don't know. That may not be the best idea. We don't know how this all works still. We have to be getting close to the bottom of this place, right?"

"Right."

"Good. Then we go deep down and comb every floor for her room until we find it."

"Not to be a downer, but Ethan, she was impaled before she fell. Even if you're right about the rooms but wrong about the immortal thing…."

"Then we'd better move fast."

I nodded, and together, we turned and began walking toward the door. I grabbed the handle and pushed it open, but the area I saw on the other side gave me an overwhelming sense of déjà vu.

It appeared to be a hotel lobby. It was large and vacant, with old pop art rotting on its walls and damp, moldy patterned carpet beneath us. White fluorescent bulbs hummed with life, yet the scene before us was completely dead. No sound. No movement. In front of us was a desk with papers scattered about, and behind it, we could see a dark room that's door was ajar. I squeezed my eyes shut, then reopened them, hoping that the sight was just my mind playing tricks on me. After all, a lot of the rooms looked similar in the house. This was just a coincidence. However, my heart sank when I saw the words written next to the open door ahead.

*‘SAFE ROOM*.’

"No." I declared under my breath, "No. This isn't- No."

Ethan looked at me and furrowed his brow, "What? What is it?"

I stepped into the lobby and looked around. There was no doubt. This was it. I quickly turned, then marched back past Ethan and into the catwalk room. I reached the tangled rails and began climbing over them but winced as I attempted to move my broken arm. I tried again, more carefully this time.

"Joel? Is everything okay? You aren't going crazy on me, are you?"

I dropped to the metal platform then shoved open the rusted metal door. There was no longer the long hallway we had come down before. It was the entrance to a staircase. A staircase I had seen an awfully long time ago. They looked to be a fire escape from some sort of skyscraper.

"Joel?" Ethan called, more aggressive this time. "What's going on."

I opened the door wider and stepped aside to reveal it to him, "Do you recognize these steps?"

He looked concerned that the hallway was now gone but still shook his head, "Um, not really. We have traveled down a lot of them. And we know the house changes, remember?"

"This was the second flight of stairs we came down, Ethan. And that hotel lobby in there? Daniel and I stayed in that room on our first night." I gritted my teeth and kicked the doorframe, "We're back at the damn top of the house!"

Ethan placed his hand to his forehead and brushed his hair back with a sigh, "You have got to be kidding me…."

It was then that I realized something, and my brain connected all of the ever-changing dots. I thought about all of the things that the shapeshifter had said in the time I had known it. About how the flashlight had shattered uselessly against its body, just like the indestructible walls of the house. How it moved through the structure like it was part of it. I thought about the shifting rooms and how we were all being tormented. How they seemed to know our fears and guilts as much as the shapeshifter did. All of the concepts revolved around one common thread.

"I was wrong, Ethan," I spoke. He looked up at me, "That thing, the one that can change shapes. It's not related to the house. I think it *is* the house."

Ethan perked up for a moment in thought. After a second, he nodded. "Holy shit, I think you're right." He looked around the area then continued, "Do you think it did this then?"

"I wouldn't be surprised. It seems to like to torment us. What a great way for it to crush any remaining hope we had." I barely said the sentence with any emotion for how livid I was. I hardly had any energy left.

"There has to be a way back, damn it. I mean, if these rooms shift, there may be a way to shift them again, right?"

"Not if that thing is controlling them. It's going to do its best to keep us as lost as possible. At least until we find our rooms."

Ethan looked to the floor and began rapidly tapping his foot. I could tell he was really hurting. The small glimmer of hope that had just been taken away from him must have been crushing, and with the uncertainty of Bea's life on the line, I didn't know if he could keep up his usual resolve much longer.

'C'mon, Joel.' I thought. 'Do your part for once.'

I walked into the stairwell and took a seat on one of the steps, then began to take inventory. What did we have going for us? After a quick run-through, I realized that may have been a bad place to start. Though we were currently back up at the top of the house, it really felt like we were at rock bottom. The only thing we possibly had going for us was that we really had nothing left to lose, and that was a debatable positive. Otherwise, we were now set back on a six-month journey, with one of our friends trapped in an unknown void below, possibly bleeding out. We still didn't know where the exit was, we now knew that the house was a living thing that could be watching us this very second, and to top it all off, the unavoidable creature that had been tormenting us from the start was still roaming about; the Curator.

Wait a minute….

"Ethan?"

"What?"

"Would you agree that we really have nothing left to lose?"

"Other than our lives? Not really."

"Well, how much value does that hold to you?"

"As of right now, not much."

"I'm glad to hear that because I think I have an idea."

I had always thought the name 'Curator' was an interesting one, but for some reason, I had never really thought much about the implications of it. It roamed the house all day looking for new trinkets and objects, and it also kept us fed and supplied on a regular schedule (even if it was all just a trap). In a sense, it was the 'Curator' of the house itself, maintaining it and keeping a collection of its treasures. The last group must have noticed that when they named it. But what was it doing with all of the stuff?

There was no chance it all went to us; It was scavenging far too much, and we often got very little. That meant It had to be keeping all of its extra loot somewhere. Probably in a place we had yet to see. And the only places we had yet to see were those even further below where we just were. The other thing to note about it was that it traveled fast. And I don't mean physically, although the thing could sprint like a cheetah. I meant that one second, we would run into it on one floor, and then two floors later, it was somehow ahead of us once again. It knew the house incredibly well, and it somehow knew how to navigate its walls as if they weren't even there.

As I explained all of this to Ethan, he stared at me, petrified with nervousness, "What are you implying, man?"

"I'm implying," I started, "That we become part of its collection."

"I'm sorry, what?"

"If we let it take us, there's a good chance that it will take us all the way back down to where it keeps all of the stuff it finds. We could be back to where we were in minutes. You know how fast that thing is. How it manages to be everywhere?"

"Yeah, but there's also a good chance that it kills us and adds our skin to its own. Didn't you and Andi say that it snapped that one guy in half on the first day here?"

"Well, technically, that only happened because Larry and Daniel were trying to shut the door on it, and…." I shivered as the image played in my head again. "If we don't fight it, I think we'll be okay."

Ethan didn't respond but just looked off toward the catwalk room in thought.

"Look, I don't like the thought either, man. Trust me. But this could be our only chance to save Bea. Daniel too, if he really is still alive."

Ethan bit his cheek really hard, then took a deep breath, "Alright, yeah. Screw it. Let's do this. Chances are we die eventually anyways, right?"

I laughed at the grim but accurate outlook, "Yeah. Right."

"And hey, if it does just kill us outright, maybe it'll wear our skin next to one another. That way, we'll always be together, even in death."

I didn't laugh as much as that one, "Great mood lightener, dude. Feeling real' confident now."

We decided that we would do what we always did to summon the thing from downstairs, and that was to make as much noise as possible. It would certainly come eventually, and from there… Well, we would see. Before we began, however, Ethan stopped me.

"Wait, man, we're only a floor below the house. Do you think we should… you know?"

I knew what he was asking. Jan and the others. They were all up there still, just waiting for us to come back. My heart yearned to see them again. To hear their voices. To know they were safe. I knew they would want to see us too, but something stopped me. We couldn't return to them. Not yet. Not without Daniel or Bea. Not before we found the exit. They would never let us go back out after hearing everything that had happened so far, and it would lose them so much hope and morale.

"I don't know if that's a good idea, man. I miss them lots, but we promised we'd come back after finding the exit. We still have a job to do."

He nodded. "Yeah. I agree."

"Although, we can do one thing…." I said, checking my watch. Wednesday. The Curator should have left a basket by now. I pulled out a piece of paper I had in my backpack, and Ethan and I began brainstorming a very quick message:

*Hello, Everyone.*

*We miss you dearly. We're close to the exit. Stay in rooms; house below is trapped. Be back soon, love you all.*

*-Your friends.*

We didn't have time to explain much, and we felt bad about leaving out the circumstances of Bea and Daniel, but the last thing we wanted was for them to panic right now. We made our way up the stairs and into the familiar rooms just below the house. It seemed these ones didn't get caught in the shifting like the others. As we padded through the dark halls, my heart fluttered at the sound of voices above us. The others, laughing and talking about something. I grinned as I imagined Grace telling one of her wild stories while the others listened and laughed along. I froze entirely at another sound, however.

The sudden sound of a baby's gentle crying.

I heard a voice tell the others to give them a moment before they stood up and walked across the floor above. Soon after, the crying stopped.

I couldn't help but tear up a bit. I couldn't believe I hadn't remembered that Jan would give birth while we were gone. It was almost sad to me that we missed it. We were all family, and it felt like we had missed the birth of a new member. I couldn't imagine how scared she must have been to deliver a child in such a dark place with no medical help. But the voice I had heard was hers, and to hear that she was okay alongside her baby brought me some much needed joy. I almost reconsidered going back in, just to see them for only a moment. But now, we had even more of a reason to push forward; that baby needed a future outside of this house. Ethan slapped me on the back and beamed a smile at me. I did the same to him back and laughed quietly with glee. I couldn't wait for when I got to meet them, but for now, we carried on.

Ethan and I rounded the corner of the steps in the lounge room and greeted the dim glow of natural light from above. It was a sight I hadn't seen in six months. We pushed open the cracked door to the yellow room, and it was hard to believe that the haunting place that I had always feared brought me so much nostalgia to see. Andi's blood trail still left its crimson burn in the carpet, and in the middle of the floor, a damp cardboard box had been repurposed for this week's basket. We tucked the note inside and then stepped back down into the darkness, giving one last look to the door that separated us from the others.

Ethan and I didn't say anything to one another the whole way back down the steps, but I knew we were both having second thoughts. We were terrified, and I knew that both of us were just praying that the other come up with an alternative. However, we knew that if we did, someone would have spoken up, and by the time we stepped off the bottom step, no sounds had been made. We opened the door and found that the catwalk room beyond had already changed. 'There goes the plan of trying to jump into the pit instead,' I thought. The room was now an old arcade, where a few machines still flickered and buzzed with strange, off-brand games I had never heard of before. Hallways led off to the sides of the large area, and after a long pause and sweep of the room, making sure nothing else was here with us, I turned to Ethan.

He nodded, and we began.

"Hey, Ethan!" I shouted. It felt wrong, and instantly the sound of my own volume jolted me to my core. I could see my friend wince too. "You see that thing around lately?!"

"What thing?!" He screamed back. "That horrific nightmare from hell?!"

"Yeah, that's the one! The thing with all the skin patches!"

"Nah! Haven't seen it! I wish it would come out, though! I'd love to play with it!"

"Me too! Look at all the fun we could have in this room!"

"Yeah! So much fun! Like this!" Ethan picked up a stool then smashed it into a nearby arcade cabinet screen. The shattering glass may as well have been a gunshot.

"Yeah! Or even this!" I yelled, using the fear-fueled adrenaline within me to shove a nearby cabinet over. It toppled to the ground with a mighty Thud!

"Gahhh!" Ethan screamed, chucking the stool across the room at the wall. It slammed into the surface, leaving a hole in the sheetrock where one of the legs struck.

I went to kick a 25-cent machine over when my brain registered what had just happened. A... hole?

*Tink TINK tonk tink PLINK!*

Our heads snapped toward the hallway where we had heard the sound. Down a corridor lined with stickers of stars and planets, the skeletal head of the curator peeked around the corner, clutching the wall with a bony, skin-patched hand. It had already been close.

"Okay…" Ethan muttered with a shaky breath, "Here we go."

The creature crept slowly into the hall and began cautiously making its way toward us, tapping on the instrument beneath its skin as it went. After it reached the entrance to the room, it stopped and cocked its head, staring at us with curiosity.

"F-Friends?" It squeaked out excitedly.

By this point, I had been close to the Curator more times than I had ever wished to be. However, at least in the times so far, there had always been a filter over my view of it, whether it be darkness, distance, or part of its body being obscured behind a wall. Now there was nothing. Black lights from the arcade ceiling highlighted the massive beast in a ghastly aura. Its bleached patches of skin, skeletal teeth, and eager white orbs glowed sinisterly as it stared us down. Every part of my body urged me to run away, to hide, to do anything other than stand there helplessly.

Nevertheless, I held my ground. This was our only shot at finding Bea. It reared up onto its legs, towering over us, then inspected the rest of the room with caution.

"Don't worry, big guy." I told it with a knot in my throat, "No tricks this time. We're all yours."

It stared at us for a moment, analyzing our every action, before it chomped its perfect teeth together twice. In an instant, it lunged forward, wrapping a grotesque hand around the two of us. Ethan let out a cry of surprise and fear, and I let out a yell of pain as it crushed my disjointed arm into my side. It giggled and squealed with glee as it began barreling down through the hallways of the house.

I could barely breathe with how tight it was holding me, and the panic combined with the radiating pain from my arm was making my heart beat a million miles an hour. The Curator zigzagged down corridor after corridor, clearly on a mission to get somewhere specific. It stopped before a set of rusted steel doors, then reached forward and pried them open with a single finger. An elevator shaft… How had we never seen one in the house before?

The curator adjusted us in its hands, sliding us both into one palm, then began squeezing even tighter than before. I watched my vision blur as my lungs were crushed up against Ethan's back. From the sound of his breathing, he was experiencing the same pain. The curator reached into the elevator's black shoot, grabbed ahold of one of the chords, then pulled itself inside. Rapidly, it began to slide down it like a firepole at alarming speeds. A scream rose to my lips from the sensation, but with no air to fuel it, my vision turned red instead.

Soon the darkness of the shaft blurred with the darkness of unconsciousness, and it didn't take long for the latter to win out.
