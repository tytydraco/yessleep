I always thought I was alone in my apartment. I never heard any strange noises or saw any weird shadows. But that all changed when I moved into my new place. It was a small, cozy apartment, perfect for a single person like me.

The first few weeks were great. I spent my time unpacking and settling in. But then, things started to get weird. It started with small things, like finding items in places where I knew I hadn't put them. I brushed it off, thinking that I must have just forgotten.

But then, I started hearing strange noises at night. At first, it was just a faint tapping, but then it turned into loud banging. I checked every room, but there was never anything there. It was as if the noise was coming from inside the walls.

One night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I was sure I had closed it before going to bed. I checked to see if anyone had broken in, but there were no signs of forced entry.

As the days passed, the noises continued, and I began to feel like I was being watched. I would catch glimpses of shadows out of the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, there was never anything there.

One evening, I was sitting on the couch, watching TV when I heard a loud crash. I ran into the kitchen to find that all of my plates had been smashed on the floor. But what was even more strange was that the shards of the plates had been arranged into a strange symbol.

I couldn't take it anymore. I called a friend and asked if I could stay with her for a few nights. She agreed, and I packed a bag and left the apartment.

As soon as I arrived at my friend's house, I felt a sense of relief. I thought that maybe I was just imagining things, that I had let my imagination get the better of me. But then, my friend showed me something that made me feel like I was going crazy.

She showed me a video that she had taken on her phone. It was a video of me, in my apartment, sleeping. But what was strange about it was that there was someone else in the room with me. A figure, standing in the corner, watching me sleep.

I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't go back to my apartment, but I didn't want to involve the police. I was afraid they would think I was crazy.

That's when I remembered that my uncle was a paranormal investigator. I called him and told him everything that had been happening. He agreed to come and investigate.

When my uncle arrived, he immediately set up his equipment. He had cameras, audio recorders, and even a device that could detect paranormal activity.

We spent the night in my apartment, waiting for something to happen. And then, it did. The room became cold, and the lights started to flicker. My uncle's equipment began to beep and flash.

And then, we saw it. A figure, standing in the corner of the room. It was just like in the video my friend had taken. My uncle tried to communicate with it, but it didn't respond.

We decided to leave the apartment and regroup. My uncle said he needed to do some research and that he would be back in a few days.

When he returned, he had some news for me. He had found out that the building I lived in had a dark history. It was built on an old graveyard, and the bodies had never been properly moved. The strange symbol that I had found in my kitchen was a symbol used in a ritual that was used to communicate with the dead
