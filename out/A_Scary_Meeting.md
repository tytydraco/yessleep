I was with two of my friends that night, when it happened.
I was driving them home, because I was the only one who didn't drink at the party we attended early in the evening 

We were on the road when my friend, Alex felt sick, so I decided to park the car a few minutes on the sideroad and wait for him to get better.

I remember, it was a clear night because of the full moon, high in the sky. The landscape was beautiful.

The beach was close to the road and I could perfectly see it. To the dark grey sand, the bright sea and the big boulder in the middle, not far from the shore. 

But, something strange was on it so I got closer.

At first, I was startled because who in their right mind could sleep on a boulder, half immersed in the cold water of winter, at 3 in the morning.

That's were things got weird. The "thing" looked like a woman at first but instead of legs, she had a strong tail, covered in scales with what it looked like, a skark fin on top of her back. Her skin was grey but with the night, so everything else around me.

She seemed asleep with her head resting on her forearms. 
In the panick, I shouted to my other friend, Mira to put the headlight of the car on, because I wanted to see it better and when I looked in front of me again, so was the "thing".

God, I could never forget it.
She was starring at me, her bottom half lying on the boulder, while she was standing on her webbed hands who ended up with big claws .

Her hair was moving with the wind but they were weird, like snakes but it wasn't realy snakes, I don't know how to discribe it.

She had two big white eyes with no pupils at all or eyebrows and instead of a nose, she had six slits in both sides of her face and her mouth was very small, thin and with no lips.

I was so frightned by her eyes, staring at me, I couldn't move a single bone in my body. 

Then I hear my friends run to me, and before they arrived, she turned on her tail and disappeared into the sea with a loud splash and waves all around and just like that, she was gone.

All this happened in secondes but it was eternity for me.

My friends didnt see anything and I was too shocked to tell them. To this day , they still don't know what happened to me and I didn't tell anybody either.
Nobody would have beleive me and I can't blame them. 
If this would have happened to somebody else, I would never have beleive them either.

And frankly, I didn't want to be called " crazy".
Sometimes I wonder if indeed i'm not crazy but then one day, several month after that night, I saw on tv that a diver was scared to death on the same area. 

Doctors said that he must have seen something really scary.
I dont think it s a co√Øncidence.

Now, I know that I saw a real mermaid and it was not the pretty mermaid Hollywood want us to beleive.

I don't know if she was good or not, I was just so scared. Humans are scared of the unknown and this proved to be true.

Since then I'am scared of swimming. I live on an island so of course there is the sea all around but I don't go in there, I'am still scared and I dont want to see her ever again.

I never returned to that beach because I know what's in there and you would be scared to death too if you ever meet that thing in the water.
