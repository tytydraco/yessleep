The first time I saw her, she was sitting at the edge of the coffee shop patio, legs crossed, tapping the heel of one sneaker against the chair leg like she was keeping time with music only she could hear.

She wasn’t loud or showy—just calm and still, like she owned the moment. It’s hard to explain, but you’d know it if you saw it. Her hair was tied back in a low ponytail, loose strands framing her face.

She’d glance at people as they walked past but never lingered too long, like she was keeping track of the world but wasn’t part of it. She wore a dark green jacket, the kind you keep wearing after a hundred rainy days. It looked like it had seen some things—and made it through.

I’d just ordered my drink and was waiting at the counter when she caught me looking at her. Not a glance—full-on, eyes-locked, I see you seeing me kind of look. I’m not sure why I didn’t look away. I’d like to say it’s because I was bold, but the truth is I just froze. She didn’t smile, didn’t scowl—just raised one eyebrow, like she’d caught me mid-crime and was deciding if I’d get away with it.

I’d never felt so seen.

When my drink came up, I grabbed it and sat a few tables away from her. I’m not slick, so I’m sure she knew I’d picked that spot on purpose.

I’d glance at her, sip my coffee, scroll on my phone like I had something important going on. She’d glance back, tap her sneaker, eyes scanning the street like she was waiting for someone who’d never show up. I’d never been more aware of how much I’d been looking at her until she looked back.

After about ten minutes of this, she got up and walked over. She sat right across from me like it was the most normal thing in the world. No introduction, no “Hi” or “Mind if I join you?”—she just was there.

Her eyes were brown but sharp, like they could cut you if she wanted. Her whole posture said she’d seen this kind of moment before and knew how it ended. She rested her arms on the table and leaned in like we’d been friends for years.

I’m not smooth. Never have been. My brain went blank, and I just laughed—quick, nervous, like I’d been caught doing something I shouldn’t.

She didn’t laugh with me, but she didn’t leave either.

Over the next couple of weeks, we saw each other almost every day. Coffee shop hangouts turned into late-night drives, fries eaten out of crumpled fast food bags, and long walks with no destination. We’d talk about nothing but somehow, it felt like everything.

She’d tell me little pieces of her past—where she’d lived, places she’d been—but never too much. Always just enough to make me want to know more.

I’d text her at midnight just to see if she’d reply. She always did—sometimes with a song, sometimes just a “Still awake?”

And I’d stay up, even when I knew I’d be dead at work the next day, just because it felt like something you’d miss if you didn’t.

Being with her felt like being pulled into the center of something important. Like she’d chosen me for something, and I’d be stupid to walk away from it. One night, I’m at home on the couch, scrolling through random TV channels with the phone pressed to my ear.

I’m catching up with a friend, just talking about work, plans for the weekend, and all that usual stuff. We’re halfway through a conversation about a movie he’s recommending when, without thinking, I mention Easton. I’m halfway through saying her name when she’s right there.

I didn’t even hear her get up. She’s just there, next to me, hand out, palm up. The look on her face isn’t anger—it’s sharper than that. I’m so caught off guard that I hand her the phone without thinking. She’s already ended the call before I realize what’s happening. My friend’s voice cuts off mid-sentence. She’s staring at the phone like it’s about to explode. Then she looks at me. Her eyes lock on mine, colder than I’d ever seen them.

“No one can know about me.”

No one.

Her grip on the phone is tight like she’s ready to crush it.

Her gaze pins me in place like I’m a bug under glass. I stay quiet, feeling my pulse tick in my neck. Something about her posture tells me it’s not up for discussion.

I nod, slow, and she finally releases the phone, her fingers lingering just a little too long. She says if anyone finds out about her, they will come. Just that. Nothing more. Her eyes don’t blink. I ask her who “they” are, but she won’t say.

She looks away like she’s already said too much. She’s quiet for a while after that, and I don’t push it. I’m not sure why, but something about the way she’s holding herself makes me feel like asking again would be a mistake.

Later that day, one of my coworkers says he saw me with a hot girl. He’s laughing, nudging me like it’s a big deal, and without thinking, I say, “That’s my secret girlfriend.” I tell him to keep it quiet, and we both laugh it off, but the second it’s out of my mouth, I feel it. Like I’ve broken some invisible rule.

That night, it’s 2:00 in the morning, and we’re at my place. The only light is from the TV casting blue shadows on the walls. We’re on the couch, her legs draped over mine, and I’m thinking about how lucky I got.

Her laugh comes easy, the kind of sound you feel in your chest, and before I know it, we’re kissing. It’s slow at first, but it builds like it always does with her—this steady pull that makes it feel like the world is tilting toward her.

Suddenly there’s a knock at the door. It’s loud, sharp, and it makes both of us jump. Not a polite, "Hey, you home?" kind of knock. It's slow and firm, like the sound of someone who knows they’ll be let in eventually.

My heart jumps straight into my throat. Easton pulls back, her eyes locked on mine. Her face goes still—terrified, listening for something. Her eyes flick toward the door, then back to me. We don’t move. Neither of us breathes. The knock comes again, harder this time, like a fist pounding against wood.

Her hand clamps over my mouth, and I feel it trembling against my skin. That’s when I realize she’s really scared. Not her usual calm, collected self—she’s terrified.

My eyes dart to the door. Easton’s hand is still on my mouth, fingers trembling, and that’s somehow worse than the knock. Her eyes stay on the door, unblinking. I break away and head for the bedroom, heart hammering. I yank open the nightstand drawer, grab the cold metal of the gun, and check the chamber. Her eyes are on me the whole time. She shakes her head slowly, her face pale, eyes pleading. I grip the gun tighter, ignoring her. I’m not about to be caught off guard tonight.

Her fingers twitch like she wants to grab my arm but doesn’t. Her eyes are locked on mine, silently screaming something I don’t want to hear. She moves toward the closet without a sound. I feel the shift in the air as she disappears from view.

Gun at my side, I walk to the door, every step heavier than the last. My heart’s pounding so loud I’m sure they can hear it. I stop in front of the door, staring at the peephole like it’s a loaded gun aimed at my head. The air feels electric, sharp and thin. I tilt my head, listen hard, but whoever’s on the other side is silent now.

Waiting. I stay still, ear tilted toward the door, trying to pick up even the slightest sound.

A soft scrape against the door—like something sharp being dragged across the wood. My breath catches in my throat. The noise is slow and deliberate. Not the clumsy scuffle of someone brushing past.

It’s slow. Measured. Like they want me to hear it.

The hair on the back of my neck stands up.

My fingers tighten on the gun’s grip, my knuckles turning white. My body’s telling me to back away, to get behind something solid, but I can’t. I’m frozen, every muscle tense like if I move, I’ll give away my position.

Another scrape—higher this time, like whoever’s out there is running something along the top of the door.

I glance back toward the closet. Easton’s eyes are just barely visible through the gap in the door, wide and unblinking. She doesn't move. Doesn’t even flinch. Her fear is its own gravity, pulling me tighter into it. A shadow passes under the door, blocking the faint glow from the hall light. I see it—clear as day—a shift in the light like someone crouched low, right on the other side.

I step back, chest rising and falling too fast now.

The scrape stops. Nothing.

My ears strain for sound, anything, but there’s nothing at all.

The air feels thicker, like I’m underwater. I glance back at Easton. She’s shaking her head. Slow, controlled, like she knows exactly what’s about to happen. Her eyes flick from me to the door, like she’s silently begging me don’t move, don’t move, don’t move.

A knock comes, soft this time.

Not the pounding from before. This one is gentle. Three taps, slow and patient, like whoever’s out there has all the time in the world.

I feel the sweat drip down the back of my neck. It’s cold, but I’m burning up. The knock comes again—just as soft, just as slow. It’s worse this way. It’s so much worse this way. I press my back against the wall, gun raised, barrel aimed at the door.

My thumb rests on the safety. I flick it off, and the click feels too loud. I squeeze the grip like it’s the only thing tethering me to the ground. A voice comes from the other side of the door. Low. Whispery. “I know you’re in there.”

My breath stutters, and I press myself harder against the wall. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even a shout. It was the kind of voice someone would use if they were talking to you through a crack in a closet door. Close. Too close. “Just want to talk.”

The voice is calm, like he’s smiling while he says it.

My chest tightens so hard I can barely breathe. The way he says it, it’s not a request. It’s a statement. Like he already knows how this is going to end.

I want to shout something back, tell him to leave, tell him I’m armed, but the words stick in my throat. My mind is spinning too fast. My whole body is screaming don’t say a word.

I glance at Easton again, and she’s curled tighter into the closet, eyes locked on me.

Her mouth is pressed into a thin line, so tight her lips are white. Her face says everything I’m feeling: Don’t. Move.

The voice doesn’t come again.

I stare at the peephole, every muscle burning from how tense I am.

My arms feel like lead, but I don’t lower the gun. Minutes pass. Five, maybe ten. Long enough that my hands start to cramp.

The silence is suffocating, like the world outside stopped moving. Then, finally, footsteps. Slow. Heavy. They move away from the door. Not rushed. Just... leaving. Like it was never a big deal to begin with.

My breath comes out in one long, shaky gasp. I don't realize I’ve been holding it until I almost choke. I wait. I wait longer than I probably need to. Every second, I expect the footsteps to stop, to hear them come back. But they don't. He’s gone.

I’m still pressed against the wall, every part of me buzzing with leftover adrenaline. My hand’s numb from how hard I’ve been gripping the gun. I’m listening so hard it’s like my ears have their own heartbeat. The only sound is my breathing, too fast and too shallow.

Easton’s eyes are locked on me from the crack in the closet door. She’s still shaking her head, slow and steady. It’s not over.

I’m about to say something—maybe ask her if she’s okay, maybe tell her it’s fine—but then I see her eyes shift. They’re not looking at me anymore. They’re looking past me. Her face goes pale, like all the blood just drained out of it. I’ve seen people scared before, but this? This is something else.

My whole body turns ice cold. I’m afraid to move, afraid to turn around, but I have to. I twist my head slowly, inch by inch, every nerve screaming at me to stop.

The hallway leading to the bedroom is right behind me. It’s dark, except for the faint glow from the TV. The shadows are long and deep, and at first, I think that’s all I’m seeing—just shadows. Just the play of light on the walls.

But then I see it.

A shape. Right there at the edge of the hallway, half-hidden in shadow. Tall. Too tall. Shoulders too broad. The outline of a head, tilted just slightly like he’s looking at me. He’s not moving, but I know he’s there. The shadows don’t breathe like that. The shadows don’t have the shape of hands.

My heart seizes in my chest. I’m frozen, like if I don’t move, he’ll go away. But he’s not going away. He’s just standing there, his head tilting a little more, like he’s curious. Like he’s waiting to see what I’ll do.

“Easton,” I whisper, barely breathing the word. “Don’t move.”

Her breathing changes. It’s shallow, quick little puffs of air like she’s trying not to gasp.

The shape in the hall shifts. One small step forward.

I feel it in my bones before I see it—that slow, deliberate shift of weight. My knees lock, and every instinct in me is screaming to run, but I’d have to turn my back to do that. I’m not turning my back. I’m not.

Another step. I see his foot now. A boot. Scuffed, dirty. The edge of it just barely in the light from the TV.

“I’m armed,” I say, louder this time. My voice cracks. I’m trying to sound strong, but it’s not working. “I’ll shoot. I’m not joking, man.”

He stops. Just stands there, that same tilt to his head like he’s weighing his options. My heart’s slamming against my ribs. I’m sure he can hear it. I’m sure he can hear everything.

“Who are you?” I’m louder now, the words sharp and fast. “What do you want?”

No answer. Just the hum of the TV and the thud of my pulse in my ears. The shape stays there, still as stone, but he’s watching me. I know he’s watching me.

“Leave.” My voice cracks on the word. “Leave now, and I won’t call the cops.”

Silence.

I’m gripping the gun so tight I’m afraid I’ll fire by accident.

He takes another step forward. I see him now—not just the outline. The TV light catches his face for half a second as he moves. It’s blank. No expression. Eyes locked on me like I’m a puzzle he’s almost solved. His mouth is just slightly open, like he’s about to say something but changed his mind.

“I’ll shoot you,” I say again, louder this time.

He’s not smiling, but somehow it’s worse than if he was. He’s too calm. Too in control.

The sound comes next. A knock. Three soft taps, slow and patient, coming from the front door. My eyes flick to it, just for a second. A mistake. When I look back, he’s gone. The hallway’s empty.

I’m shaking so bad I’m worried I’ll drop the gun. My eyes dart back to the closet. Easton’s crouched in the dark, her hands covering her face, fingers dug into her hair. Her eyes meet mine, and she’s shaking her head again. No. No. No.

Another knock. Same rhythm. Three soft taps.

“They’re here,” Easton whispers. Her voice is so small, I almost don’t hear it. She’s staring at me with wide, glassy eyes. “You told someone. You told someone about me?”

Her words hit me like ice water.

“I told you not too...” she whispers.

The knocking stops. My breath catches in my chest, and I’m sure I’m about to hear footsteps. But I don’t.

I’m locked in place, a statue made of brittle bones and fraying nerves. My eyes flick to the closet. Easton’s clutching the doorframe like it’s the only thing holding her together. Her eyes are wild, darting from me to the darkness behind me. She’s watching it too, watching something I’m too afraid to see.

There’s a shift. The faintest creak of weight on the floorboards, the kind of sound a person makes when they’re trying to stay quiet. It’s so close. Too close.

I squeeze the gun tighter. My arms feel like lead pipes, stiff and heavy. Every muscle in my back is taut, pulled tight as a wire. My finger hovers over the trigger, just barely brushing it. I’m not sure I’d have the control to pull it clean. Not with my hands shaking like this.

I’m running through every option I have, every way this could go. If I turn, I’m dead. If I shoot blind, I’m probably worse than dead.

A shift in the floor behind me. The sudden rush of movement. My body moves before my brain catches up. I drop low, twisting to the side, one arm raised, gun already swinging toward him. I’m not thinking. I’m just reacting.

He’s fast. Too fast. A blur of shadow and motion. I see a flash of his face, eyes dark and sharp, mouth set in something that’s not quite a smile. His hand—I see it—reaching for me, fingers hooked like claws.

I don’t hesitate. I’ve got one shot. One chance.

I fire.

The gunshot explodes in the small space, deafening and sharp. The flash of light is blinding, searing the image of him into my eyes for half a second—that face, so close to mine, too close. The impact jerks my arms back, and the recoil shoots up my shoulders like lightning.

There’s a thud. Not loud, but heavy. Solid. Like something big hitting the ground.

My vision’s shot, too much flash and too much fear. I’m scanning for him, waiting for him to get up, to grab me, to—

Nothing.

The air’s thick with the smell of gunpowder and something else. Something sharp and coppery.

My eyes adjust slowly, and I see him sprawled on the floor, one arm stretched toward me, fingers just barely reaching. His face is turned away, but I can see the dark pool spreading under him, soaking into the wood.

Easton’s still in the closet, staring at me, her face pale as a ghost. She’s not shaking her head anymore. She’s just staring.

I’m breathing hard, the gun still raised, barrel aimed right at him.

I’m not moving. Not until I’m sure. Not until I’m certain he’s not getting up.

Another creak.

But it’s not from him.

It’s from the front door.

Three slow knocks.

I’d swear it’s the same rhythm as before.

I’m done waiting. Every muscle in my body protests as I force myself to move, feet dragging like I’m walking through water. I’m at the door now, breath shallow. My hand grips the doorknob, slick with sweat, and I twist it slowly. No sudden moves.

The door creaks open an inch, then two, then all the way.

Nothing.

The street outside is empty. No footsteps, no shadowy figure waiting in the glow of the streetlight. I scan left, then right, but there’s no one there. No sign that anyone had ever been there at all.

I shut the door, turn the lock, and brace my back against it.

My breath comes out in a rush, like I’ve been holding it for hours

I glance back to the living room. The floorboards are stained dark where he fell.

But he’s gone.

The spot where his body was sprawled is empty. No outstretched arm. No twisted face. No body. Only the stain remains, glistening faintly in the dim light.

My throat tightens. I’m walking backward now, eyes locked on that spot, afraid to blink, afraid to look away.

I feel Easton’s presence behind me before I hear her move. Her footsteps are soft but deliberate. When I turn, she’s already pulling on her jacket. Her eyes don’t meet mine.

She’s at the door before I can say anything, hand on the knob, body half-turned like she’s waiting for me to stop her.

“Don’t ever mention my name to anyone again,” she says, voice low. “Or they’ll come for you.”

I don’t move. I don’t say a word.

She opens the door. Steps out. Closes it behind her.

That’s the last time I see her.

No goodbye. No texts. No calls. Just… gone.

Her number stops working. My messages stay delivered for exactly one day. Then nothing.

I want to ask people—someone, anyone—if they’ve seen her.  
  


But I don’t.  
  


I’m too scared.  
  


I don’t even say her name out loud anymore. Not even in my own head.

Weeks pass. I try to go back to normal, whatever that means.

Then one day, I’m clearing out my camera roll.  
I scroll past the usual—screenshots, memes, dumb stuff from work—when I find a photo I don’t remember taking.

It’s me.  
Sitting outside the coffee shop.  
Smiling at someone just out of frame.

The timestamp is the day we met.

I almost swipe past it—  
But then I see it.  
In the reflection of the window behind me.

A dark figure standing across the street.

Watching.
