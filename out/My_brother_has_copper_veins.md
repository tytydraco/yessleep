It started when I first saw my little brother Mason chewing on wires. He was six at the time, and I was ten. Our family was particularly unremarkable, we lived in mundane uneventful suburbia for most of our lives. 

Nothing that might cause any trauma, or cause us to act in any strange and psychotic ways. So it was a bit of a shock when I discovered my baby brother savagely tearing through charger cables and HDMI cords like it was licorice. 

The outer casing of the wires were stripped off with his teeth, revealing the shiny copper innards. He dug the thin, metallic strings out from their shells and stuck them in his mouth and nose.
“Mason! Stop that!” I shouted. 

He looked at me with a judgemental glare, like I had just said the most offensive thing I possibly could. I desperately tried to yank the wires away from him, fearing he might hurt himself. When I finally managed to pry the wires from his clamped jaw and iron grip, he began to howl. 

It wasn't a normal tantrum, it was like he was mimicking an anguished wail, or tornado siren. This habit of his continued for months. No matter how well we hid our wires and cables to various utilities, he would find them and put them in his mouth. 

If we took them away, he would scream. It got so bad that the neighbors would come to our door to complain about the constant screeching. One particular bad incident led to my parents reaching their breaking point. 

It was the middle of the night, and I heard him whispering from his room. I was a restless sleeper, so I would often be awake in the middle of the night when I was younger, and I had never heard him whispering before he began chewing on wires. 

I crept out of bed, and tiptoed down the hall to his room. I pressed my ear against the door and listened. My face wrinkled in confusion when I heard him repeatedly reciting strange phrases. I'll never forget them.

“My body shines like silver for my God above to see.
I trade my blood for copper veins, my soul is electricity.
Lord I shed my mortal form, and take my final breath.
Grant me copper veins, O lord, O God, O prince of death.”

Over, and over, and over. He repeated it, almost like a desperate prayer. Our family wasn't religious, and I don't know where my little brother could have possibly learned such an odd chant. Something else bothered me about it, Mason sounded weirdly… adult. 

Though his voice was definitely still that of a six year old, his cadence and pattern of speech was uncharacteristically mature. He would usually slur his L’s and R’s, he didn't do that here. I stood by the door listening to his whispers for maybe fifteen minutes, just utterly perplexed and creeped out. 

Eventually, I wanted to make sure he was okay, and slowly opened the door.
“Mason? Are you okay?” I asked him in a hushed voice. As soon as I opened the door, his whispering stopped. 

His room was completely silent. “Mason…?” I repeated. His room was very dark, and it was hard to make out what he was doing. He was out of his bed, sitting on the floor near the wall. He didn't respond, he only sat there, completely still. 

I reached up to flick on the light, and my blood turned to ice. As soon as the light turned on, Mason turned his head to face me. There were about a dozen copper wires digging into his face, they dug under his eyes, into his nostrils, and into his mouth. 

The wires snaked out from the wall, where an outlet had been torn out. Call it the overactive imagination of a child, but the wires that connected from him to the outlet almost looked like they were moving, wriggling like worms. 

Blood dribbled lightly out of his bloodshot eyes, which met my horrified gaze. He looked at me with a furious, burning intensity. I was too shocked to scream, or even move. Before I could come to my senses, Mason's eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he gritted his teeth in a pained expression.

“GRANT ME COPPER VEINS!!” He yelled. He raised his tiny hand, and there was suddenly a strange buzzing sound. The lightbulb in his bedroom exploded, sparks shot out from the ceiling. 

The light switch burst with a crackle of electricity, smoke and sparks shot out from the hole it left behind. I squealed and ran, my little legs pitter pattering as fast as they could. The buzzing noise grew louder, and seemed to emanate from all over the house. 

The lights flickered on and off as I desperately ran to my parents bedroom. I tripped on something in the living room, and fell to the ground.
“Mom! Dad! Help! Please! Mom!” I cried. I couldn't move from that spot, I just curled up in the fetal position and began to cry. 

“What the hell is going on??” My father angrily yelled, stomping towards Mason's room. The lights above burst, one after the other. I remained there on the ground whimpering, when I heard my father enter Mason's room. 

“MASON! WHAT DID I TELL YOU?” He hollered. I winced, I've never heard him that mad before. My mother approached the living room and spotted me on the floor, kneeling down next to me.

“It's okay, it's okay…” She said in a quivering, worried voice. She gently stroked my back, and I tried to block out the noises erupting from Mason's bedroom. But I heard.

“No… NO!!!” Mason screamed in an unnaturally anguished tone. I heard a bang, a thud, followed by repeated smacking.
“WHAT, DID I, FUCKING, TELL YOU?!” My dad yelled. 

The buzzing noise stopped, the sparks flying from the exposed wiring in the lights ceased. For a moment, there was complete silence. Then, Mason began to sob. I recognized the sound of my brother crying, he was back to his normal self. 

I don't remember much after that, I remember I stayed home with mom while my dad took my sobbing brother outside, and drove off with him somewhere. After that, my brother's strange habit seemed to stop completely. 

We never spoke of that night, not to each other, not to anyone else. He never chewed on wires, never whispered at night or spoke in a strange way ever again. Apparently my dad  set him up with a “behavioral counselor”, and took him there after school every day. 

I remember feeling very weird about my brother being gone for a sizable chunk of the day, usually I would play games with him or watch him play Zelda (he was scared of the spiders, he couldn't play the game without me or mom in the room). 

He would come home at around 7, and seemed very tired. He wouldn't say much at that time, just headed straight to bed as soon as Mom or dad took him home. On days we didn't have school I got to see him, but he just wasn't himself. 

He was an energetic kid, loud, bratty and attention seeking. Like any normal kid. I don't know if it was the counselor, or the incident with the wires in his face, but he changed. It's like the life was sucked out of him, he didn't play, he didn't seem excited about anything. 

He just hung his head low, went to school, ate at the table and went straight to his room without a word. Every. Single. Day. Years passed, and I tried countless times to speak with him, get a reaction out of him, anything. 

There were only fleeting moments where his shell would crack, he'd laugh at a joke, smile every once in a while. But it never lasted long. He didn't have any friends, apparently he got good grades in school, except for activities that involved working with other students. 

I worried for him deeply, he was my baby brother. It hurts to watch him year after year, sullen and depressed, hardly speaking a word. Eventually, however, when I was nineteen and a year out of high school, and he had just started his freshman year, I heard a knock on my bedroom door.

“Yeah? What is it?” I asked, lying on my bed looking at my phone.
“Hey, can I talk to you, for a sec?” Mason asked. I perked my head up in surprise, this was the first time that I could remember him willingly starting a conversation with me that wasn't “dinners ready” or “mom said mow the lawn”. I walked up and opened the door.

“Yeah, what is it?” I asked curiously. He seemed timid, and couldn't meet my eyes directly.
“Could you- ugh.” He began to ask, clearly embarrassed. “Could you tell me how to… talk to girls?” Absolutely adorable. 

It was a bit odd, but I was glad my brother was talking to me, taking an interest in something. Slowly but surely, his shell was breaking. I talked to him for a while, gave him the best advice I could.

Things like having proper hygiene, being direct and honest, don't make it seem like you're desperate, what things were creepy and what things were romantic, just be normal and be a good person to be around. 

He seemed satisfied with our conversation, and his eyes sparked with an enthusiasm that I didn't see often. I was mostly surprised that he was taking interest in girls, it was the last thing I expected. 

Not to be mean, but if he wanted to get a girlfriend, he would need to make a lot of changes real fast. I thought that the nightmare was over. Everything about the wires, the memory of that horrible night, and my brother's reclusive lifestyle was finally fading away. 

That is, until he brought a girl home. She was staying the night in his room, he had been dating her for a few weeks but Mom and dad didn't know. He had waited to bring her over when they both went out of town, and it was only me in the house. 

It was strange because I never saw mom and dad leave, Mason just said they left while I slept in and didn't have time to say goodbye. His date was a nice enough looking girl, her name was 

Cindy, she was short and a bit odd, the kind of girl who still says outdated things like “Yeah boiiii”. I greeted them at the door, and they immediately went to his room. Whatever, I thought. 

It didn't take a rocket scientist to piece together what I'm sure they were gonna do in there, it's not like I didn't sneak boys into my room on occasion, so I didn't think much of it. 

But what was strange is that I couldn't hear any noise at all coming from his room. And after it began to get dark, I remember hearing something strange. Strange, and chillingly familiar. I was just about to head to bed when I heard it, buzzing. 

The recognizable low hum that reverberated in the house that dreadful night, was quietly sounding from the walls. I immediately went up to Mason's bedroom door and knocked.

“Mason? Is everything alright?” I asked worriedly. No response. “Mason?” I repeated. I tried the doorknob, locked. I knocked again, harder and more desperate. “Mason? Cindy? Please answer me.” I begged. 

Suddenly, silence. The buzzing stopped, and I only heard my own panicked pulse. Then, I heard Mason speak.
“The Lord has granted me copper veins.” He declared. 

My heart sank, hearing those words brought back long repressed memories, I could feel my soul being dragged back to a hell I thought I left in the past. 

What was even stranger, is that his voice didn't sound from behind the door, it seemed to emanate from the very walls of the house, all around me. “Sister. Let me ask you, do you know what they did to me?” Mason asked.

I tried to speak, but I couldn't choke out the words. “That counselor dad took me to, they tried to shock me into being normal. Can you believe that? They electrocuted the abnormality out of me. Or, they thought they did anyway.” He continued. 

My eyes widened. I had no idea what he was put through to correct his behavior. “Do you have any idea how painful that is? Day after day, a million surging flames searing through your body, forcing you to conform.”

“Mason I- I had no idea. I'm so sorry, I tried to talk to you I really-” I began to respond, Mason cut me off.
“That's right Heidi, dearest sister. You were always so compassionate. That's why you'll be spared from this.” Mason appraised. I stepped back in worry and confusion.

“Spared? What do you mean? What are you doing?” I questioned. I flinched when the lights flickered, all the lights. The buzzing returned, louder and stronger than ever.

“Why don't you come see?” Mason invited ominously. His bedroom door opened all by itself. I slowly crept in, and I almost screamed when I saw what was going on inside. 

There were wires everywhere. Exposed copper and aluminum wires sprawling all over the walls and ceiling, spooling on the floor, erupting from the busted open light switch sockets and snaking out of every outlet like mechanical vines. 

My brother stood in the center of the room, wires pouring into his head, only this time it was far worse. Hundreds of wires traveled into his eye sockets, his eyes were no longer visible and streaks of blood traveled down his face and stained his shirt. 

Wires dug up into his fingernails, eviscerating his hands into bloody, shredded sockets to act as plugs for the copper wires to enter. His feet weren't visible, buried beneath the pool of wires. And most unsettling was the fact that the wires were moving. 

They squirmed and wriggled like hundreds of incredibly long worms, slithering and convulsing. Mason raised his bloodied hands and grinned madly. “The Lord granteth you copper veins! Feel the wrath of the Almighty!” He bellowed. 

I was horrified. I walked into the room, and the door was shut behind me. My horror increased tenfold when I saw them. My parents, Cindy, and a man and a woman that I didn't recognize, were all stuck in the wires. 

Half submerged in a web of copper, they writhed and struggled, but couldn't escape. Wires poured into their mouths, they had specks of blood spurting out of their throats and made desperate choking and gagging noises. 

“M-mason… what…what is this?!” I cried. My legs felt like they were melting into the floor, I couldn't do anything but sit there and watch the five struggling victims writhing in agony.

“Divine retribution.” He replied with a chuckle. “My God has blessed me, I am a catalyst for his will. These sinners have committed blasphemy, an attempt to silence I, the vessel of the Lord. And so they shall feel ultimate justice.” He rambled. 

He clenched his fist, and the buzzing noise erupted in volume. Sparks began flying from the wriggling wires, the lights were flashing on and off. Worst of all was the screaming. 

Mom, dad, Cindy and the two other victims were all making bloodcurdling screams. I could see flashes of electricity shooting out of them, burning their skin. Smoke rose from their bodies, and a sickening scent filled the room. 

They twitched and convulsed from the powerful electric currents traveling through them. They screamed and screamed, all I could do was watch in utter terror and disbelief.

“MASON!! STOP THIS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” I yelled. Mason lowered his arms, and the buzzing slowly died down, the lights stopped flickering, and the crackling noise of my parent's, Cindy's and the two strangers burning flesh subsided. Mason frowned and turned his eyeless head to me. “They deserve it.” He asserted. 

“These… crooked and rotten blasphemers, they were jealous of my communion with God! Ever since I was young, I could speak to him. He exists in the wires, yes, he travels everywhere! And he speaks to me, ONLY me.” Mason spat, red frothy saliva dripping out his mouth. 

“Dad tried to beat it out of me, that violent maladjusted piece of shit never could keep his hands to himself. And our cocksucking whore mother just sat and watched him do it! YOU FUCKING ANIMALS!!” Mason howled as he raised his arm once more. 

This time, the wires ensnaring mom and dad tightened around their neck and head, Mom's eyes bulged out of her head and dad started turning purple. 

“When that didn't work, they took me to doctor Peterson's office. But you and your husband aren't real doctors, aren't you?” Mason said as he turned to the two people I didn't recognize. 

“No, you're just two quacks who do experiential medicine on shit you don't understand, because you were too fucking indbred to get a real medical degree.” As he finished, the wires entangling the poor couple tightened, noticeably harder than when they had tightened around Mom and dad. 

They gurgled and spurted blood from their throats, their skin was pressed in by the wires wrapping deep around their flesh. I understood at that moment, doctor Peterson was the name of the “counselor” dad took him to. 

“And Cindy, lovely Cindy.” He turned to the helpless girl he had brought over. “I just think you're annoying. Ha ha.” Mason laughed. I had a hard time even accepting the reality of what I was seeing, how could my baby brother do this? What God is he talking about?

“Mason… I'm sorry. I know these people mistreated you, but you can't do this… please stop, please.” I pleaded, tears streaming down my face. Mason's face shifted, he was now expressionless, and was silent for a few moments. 

The silence brought attention to the pained moans of the five people trapped in the wires. They all looked towards me with haunting, desperate eyes. They sobbed and moaned in pain. Then, Mason spoke.

“Worry not, they will be delivered to my Lord, and through their death they shall be redeemed.” And with that, he snapped his fingers, and the most horrifying sight took place before my eyes. It started with the Peterson couple. 

Wires from the ceiling shot down and wrapped around their necks, lifting them up into the air. Then, the wires from the floor lunged up onto them. They wrapped around their legs, and the wires on the floor and ceiling began pulling them in opposite directions. 

The couple choked out raspy screams as the wires yanked hard on their neck and legs. I heard a grotesque ripping and squelching sound, and blood began staining the torso of the two phony doctors. 

With one final tug, the two burst in a sickening explosion of blood and viscera, they had been pulled apart. The upper halves of the couple lay hanging by the wires on the ceiling, messy chunks of flesh and blood dripped down to the wires below. 

I screamed like I had never screamed before, my every instinct finally kicked into overdrive and I tried to run.
“You are going to witness this.” Mason said as I turned to escape the room. 

I yelped as wires quickly wrapped around my ankles, dragging me back. I was yanked upright, and wires bound my body and head in place. They felt warm, and I could feel a small humming of electricity traveling through them. Wires dug into my eyelids, forcing them open.

“NO! NO NO NO NO! MASON STOP! STOP THIS! STOP THIS PLEASE!!” I begged. Mason grinned, his red stained teeth glistening. He raised his hand, and this time the ropes from the ceiling wrapped around Dad's neck. 

“DAAAAAD! NOOO NOOO STOP IT!!” I screamed so hard my throat began to burn.
“Scream all you want, nobody outside can hear us.” Mason said with a wicked smile. 

Wires from the walls, ceiling and floor all slowly rose, ends pointing at my dad's suspended body. In an instant, all the wires shot into my dad from every angle, piercing his torso, neck, hands and feet, legs and arms. 

He groaned as they penetrated his skin, traveling about an inch into his flesh.
“Let's make this one slow.” Mason stated cruelly. The buzzing noise returned, and bolts of electricity shot out of my dad at every angle. He wailed in agony. 

Sparks burst from his burning skin, he convulsed and writhed as chunks of smoking flesh slid off his body. His eyes popped, pus and blood gushed from the holes they left behind. 

Blood poured like a waterfall from his gurgling mouth. His clothes caught fire, and more and more chunks of burning skin fell off his body. Finally, he stopped convulsing. 

The wires let go of what was left of his smoking, charred black body. The corpse fell to the floor and crumbled into ash. I was sobbing and screaming, snot and tears cascading down my chin. 

There was nothing else I could do. I met my poor mother’s gaze, she was barely cognizant, she just choked and gurgled, I could only assume she meant to get out words but couldn't. Mason snapped his fingers. 

The wires ensnaring my mother tightened, her hands and head were squeezed impossibly tight. Her skin quickly turned purple, her body lumped unnaturally as it was squeezed by the many wires wrapped around her. 

Her suffocated and purple hands slowly began to bleed. Spots on her face bulged out from the ever increasing grip of the wires, her eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. 

I heard a horrible crunching noise, and my mother's face almost instantaneously collapsed in on itself like a crushed soda can. Her bones turned to pieces inside her, and her flesh flopped in a bloody mess on the ground. 

My throat was sore from screaming, all I could do was rattle out breathless gasps as I watched the carnage.
“M-mom…” I whimpered. Last to go was Cindy. 

Mason raised his hand, and the wires wrapped around Cindy like a cocoon, and lifted her into the air above Mason's head. Cindy groaned in pain as the wires twisted, contorting her in a corkscrew motion. Blood dripped out of her mouth and through the wires as she was gruesomely mangled. 

Blood now poured down in buckets, the wires were wringing Cindy like a towel above Mason, who stood there in the crimson shower. The wires finally let me go, releasing my body and eyes. I collapsed on my hands and knees.

“Aww cheer up sis.” Mason mocked. “You were witness to the first of many divine judgements.” Mason stood there, drenched in blood, arms outstretched like a preacher at a pulpit. 

“Live your life, Heidi. God is always with you.” I tensed my muscles, I could feel my heart catch fire. My fear, sadness and grief was burnt away by the rising flames of an indescribable anger. My parents weren't perfect, but they didn't deserve this. 

I clenched my teeth and balled my fists, then lunged at my blood soaked brother. I reached my hands out towards his throat, but with a swipe of his hand, hundreds of wires wrapped around my wrists and waist, then yanked me back and threw me out of the room. 

I crashed against the wall of the hallway, grunting as I slumped onto the ground. Dizzy, exhausted, traumatized, I could barely lift my head to look at my brother.

“This is where we part ways. Sister. Maybe if you had been more open, you could have been a fellow missionary.” Mason lamented. “He might have granted you copper veins.” 

And with that, the wires began to shake violently, thrashing in the air like panicked snakes. The buzzing sounded louder than ever, and I covered my ears. Mason's room filled with a blinding white light, then vanished. 

In a flash, Mason, the eviscerated bodies, and all the wires and blood completely disappeared.
“Mason?” I called out. I forced myself to my feet and entered his room. 

Nothing. Not a speck of blood, nor strand of copper wire remained in the room. All that remained was profound emptiness and silence. I fell to my knees. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what could even be done. 

I sat there on the floor for hours, trying to convince myself that none of it was real. But I had to accept it at some point, the inescapable truth is that I lost everyone all at once. My mother, my father, my brother, are all gone. I didn't call the police, I knew it would just be more trouble than help. 

Even if they did believe me, it's not like they could bring any of them back. It's been a few days since then, and I've been living in this house by myself. My life has been completely turned upside down by this. I was supposed to go off to college in a few months, I was supposed to be a doctor, I was supposed to have a life. 

I have a new responsibility now. I know I can't stay in this house forever, people are going to wonder where my parents went. I'm writing this as a desperate plea, help me find my brother. I know he's out there somewhere. 

That God he spoke of, whatever it is, it destroyed his mind. And now he acts like a puppet on electrical strings. If you hear the electrical humming of a dark and brutal God traveling through your wires, please let me know. 

I will find my brother, and I won't rest until I rip the copper veins from his body.
