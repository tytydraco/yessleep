My dad was, well is, a writer for a few small magazines and the local paper. He’s had a few of his works published but nothing that was ever big. Despite his merger successes he still managed to make enough for us to live in rural Tennessee. A few months ago, during my graduation, my father had an episode. He hadn’t been taking his meds for a while apparently and something snapped. During his episode he ran out into the street and got hit by a car. He’s been in a coma in Vanderbilt hospital for about two months now. Doctors assure us that he’ll recover but that’s not what I’m worrying about.

My dad would always send me the stories he was working on at any given time. He’d just email a pdf asking what I thought. Normally I’d receive about two stories a week but since his coma I hadn’t gotten any, for obvious reasons. But yesterday I got an email from him, a new story. In excitement I didn’t even read it before I rushed to the hospital exited to see him awake. Yet there he lies still. As unresponsive as ever. But the story is definitely from him. I even logged into his computer to see that he wrote it on 09/08/2024. Which would be two days ago as of writing this. I’m going to attach the whole story below for y’all to help me decipher. But even as I’m writing this document I just got another email from him.

Lifetime: By W.C.M

The day was bright and cold. Crip air blew across my face. My children played in the field of snow. I was happy. I had always been happy. How could I not be happy? Reina and Michael were their names, twins at the age of ten. A smile crossed my face as I gazed upon their snowball fight. “How long have they been at it?” Their mother, Jun, asked as she stepped through the sliding glass door and onto the back patio. “About an hour. I’ll call them in for breakfast soon, I’m making french toast.” She smiled and kissed me warmly on the cheek. “Make sure to let me know too.” “I will.” Time passes and the sun stretches ever higher into the morning sky. “Alright kids, time to come in!” I hear their sounds of protest and then the begrudging “ok.” As they trudge through the snow. I turn my back on them and move through the slighting glass door, through the living room, towards the kitchen. I yawn as my fingers wrap around the cold door handle. I turn the knob and the door swings open to a cacophony of sound. “SURPRISE!” Family and friends pack the small kitchen wearing party hats. A cake sits in the middle of the kitchen, happy birthday written upon it. Tears fill my eyes and a smile breaks my tired face. “Y’all are so kind.” I hear escape my lips as I step farther into the room. “Happy birthday sweetie.” Jun said softly as her arms wrapped themselves around me in a tight hug. I hug her back then turn to my children. Reina and Michael, fifteen each. Michael held out a gift “we got this for you dad.” “We hope you like it.”

I looked from Reina to Michael “I know I will.” My hands take the gift and I begin to unwrap it, slowly revealing a lamp. Simple in its construction, almost brutalist in its demeanor, it sat inside the box. My hands removed it from its cardboard prison, allowing me to take in its full simplicity. “We know you’ve been wanting a lamp for your bedside.” Reina spoke timidly. “I love it. So simple but so elegant. Thank you both.” I set The Lamp down and brought both of them into a hug. “You guys are awesome.” “Common dad…” Michale said quietly. I let them go and look up at the rest of the room’s occupants. My heart grew still, my skin grew cold. The faceless crowd stood around me. Skin pulled taught like latex over their featureless skulls. Human clothes draped over their skeletal corpses, hanging loosely as they play acted human nature. Whispered static words oozed from their skulls like words drifting through a broken radio. A scream left my lips, radiating outward in a cry for help. Soft hands came in response. Shaking me from my dreams and back into reality. “It’s ok, everything is fine.” Jun’s soft hands left me. I rolled onto my side and turned on The Lamp. “What happened?” “You were screaming in your sleep again…” I sat up and looked over at her. Jun looked exhausted. Her hair lacked its usual sheen. “I’m sorry…” “did you forget to take your meds again?” “Probably…” I stood up and slowly walked into the bathroom. I flicked the light switch and the warm buzz of the bulb filled the room. My hand reached for a small bottle on the counter and grabbed it. My eyes read the label, Quetiapine. I opened the bottle and let one of the pills fall onto my left palm. The pill went down easy and the warm buzz shut off as I flicked the switch again.

“You need to talk to the doctors again.” Jun was sitting on the bed, her eyes staring at me filled with concern. “I will.” “Promise me. I need you, they need you.” “I promise.” She slid back under the covers and closed her eyes. The weight of my condition heavy upon her. I slid back into my spot and gazed at The Lamp glowing in the dark room. Its simplicity a rebellion against the clutter of life. It didn’t belong here. Its light didn’t belong here. It was from another world, it has to be. My eyes watched as the physical tendrils of light stretched like daggers into the ethereal darkness.The Lamp was wrong. I closed my eyes and the light fought around me as I was unable to confront the incomprehensible reality that stood before me. My eyes opened, filled with tears, the coffin but a few feet away. “I’m so sorry for your loss.” A gentle hand patted me on the shoulder as the static words buzzed in my ears. I was too shocked to notice. How did it happen? How could it happen? Why did this happen? The questions raced inside my head. Yet for all their persistence one fact stood alone in its permanence. I would never see Michael smile again. His eyes would stare blankly into the void of nothing named death for evermore. My body trembled in shaking sobs as the waves of pain crashed over me. My lungs took in air but I did not breathe. I could not breathe. He could not breathe. Such a simple thing, air. Such a simple thing, to breathe. Such a simple thing, to stop breathing. Such a simple thing, to die. Air filled my lungs again, inflating them. New life was given to me, maybe it isn’t so simple to just die.

My eyes danced around the room, searching for some comfort in the tears. They rested on Jun. Sitting alone in a chair. Back straight, staring forward resolute. I made my way through the rows of chairs. Whispered apologies slipping from my lips as I made my way across the field of people that separated us. “I’m so sorry I’m late.” I whispered as I took the empty seat next to her. “It’s ok, you only missed the big speech from the dean.” “And I’m ok with that.” My hand slid into hers and I squeezed it gently. My eyes turned towards the stage as the graduates began to walk across it. Pride filled my chest as Reina stepped into view. She had accomplished so much. “I’m so proud of her.” Jun said as we clapped loudly. “I know you are.” We continued to clap until Reina left the stage and vanished from view behind the crowd of people. My eyes drifted back to the stage to watch the students I would never know graduate. Today was a magical day. The names blurred together and my attention drifted. My eyes traced every detail of the stage and all its ever shifting contents. People tall, people short. People thin, people wide. Some older, some younger, they all drifted in and out of shape and form. And then I saw it. On a table near the back, The Lamp. No, no, not The Lamp. A lamp, similar but not the same. My eyes left The Lamp and I tried to push the thought away. The Lamp. The Lamp that was given to me. He gave it to me, they gave it to me. I knew that Lamp. Every line, every bolt, every imperfection from years of abuse. I could see it all from here.

It was The Lamp. But what was it doing here? The sound of the clapping hands faded, a door closed. Footsteps,The Lamp turned on. Its daggers of light sprung forth ready for combat with the darkness. A rhythmic beeping blazed around my ears. A steady tone in its perfect permanence. “Honey, are you ok?” The buzzing words oozed into my mind. My eyes swung to my left, a Flesh Skelton mimicking spousal concern beside me. Long fingered tendrils reaching out to touch me. “It’s ok, everything is ok.” The words rang, seeping into my skull. I fell out of my chair and onto the sidewalk, slamming my head against the concrete. It took me a second to get my bearings. How did I get outside? My eyes danced around trying to process how I got outside. But as I took in my surroundings I realized that being outside was not my problem. Flesh Skeletons filled my view. Their movements no longer human. They moved in stop motion, skipping through space in tiny movements. Fear clenched me. I ran. My feet pounded upon the street. The sun blazing down upon me. The rhythmic beeping all around me. I dashed through an intersection. I was close to home, close to safety. Blinding pain filled my body. Legs crumpled. Ribs shattered. Arms twisted into geometric patterns I had never seen before. The pavement lay beneath me. Blood pooled around me, who knew I had so much. My eyes stared upwards into the light of my Lamp. In the sky it hung, drifting over as I lay immobile. The ever present beeping whispered in my ears. I knew it, it had always been there. I had always been here. The Lamp had always been up there. The long fingered hand gently touched me.
