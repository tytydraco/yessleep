I want to begin this post by saying that if you treasure the life you live and want it to remain so, stop reading, I now know things I wish with everything I am that I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve only rallied to write this after weeks of drinking emptying my stomach onto my once perfect linens and drinking more, however if you are to take my warning seriously and even slightly waver in reading further take this one thing, please for the love of your god and all you hold dear I beg of you if you have any compassion in your soul to never have children.

From the outside looking in the planet mars is just a mass of red dust that scientists say is ‚Äútotally habitual, trust me, we‚Äôll have this locked down in like 20 years‚Ä¶trust‚Äù. However for my research sect there wasn‚Äôt anything more fascinating, complex and multi-layered than this planet we so lovingly called ‚Äúthe lady‚Äù(inside joke) we all dreamed of the opportunity of getting our grubby little mitts on samples collected by the once top secret rover ‚Äúthe indomitable‚Äù, samples or ‚Äúlady parts‚Äù that helped us understand the geometric makeup of the lady üòè one of which was sample B - 9 - 2 A series photographs taken from A compressed multi-facet probe shot into the lady by the indomitable. These photos transmitting pixel by pixel onto our head geologist Adam‚Äôs computer monitor was easily the highlight of my year, the photos themselves were completely incomprehensible to my untrained eyes but seeing Adam light up like the Apollo 1 tragedy and yell to everyone else in our lab ‚ÄúWE GOT MOTHERFUCKING ALIEN RUINS!‚Äù Will with out a doubt be the happiest I can ever say I will have ever been. 

What the probe had photographed wasn‚Äôt actual alien ruins but instead A instance of indented tectonics preserving a layer of rock for a estimated 3 billion years, A geological oasis that could give us our first real insight of what the lady looked like when she still had water in her, Adam reeeaaallly jumped the gun but nevertheless this discovery left everyone ecstatic, days went by where talk of any other project was completely mute. To build a probe to dig into and properly photograph the oasis wouldn‚Äôt be anything we hadnt done before, the previous probe found it on complete accident, we only know it found it because we can tell its sensing was thrown off when it stopped digging through solid rock, slipped out and into the pocket containg our oasis. That probe technically had still been taking pictures but they werent the kind that would work in a big empty space without light, not to mention it probably broke its camera hitting the floor of this pocket. 

All we had to do was build another probe this time with a proper none geologic camera with a flash affix it to the next rover we send out and launch it in exactly the same place and angle, easy enough. 5 years after all the hype of the initial discovery died down our submission to add our probe containing 5 years of  our blood sweat and tears to the new rover being rocketed out to the lady, ‚Äúthe promise‚Äù was accepted. 8 more months elapsed as the rover was double and triple checked, sent out and floating through space before it made touchdown roughly around the location of the indomitable when it sent out the original probe capturing B - 2 - 9. This new probe‚Äôs purpose was to capture what the inside of the pocket looked like, no one believed it was a alien civilization, however this area realistically would have traces of ancient life in the form of fosils at best and psedofossil chemical patterns left from plants at worst, or nothing, there could have been nothing. 

As the photos were transmitted through million of miles of space slowly gaining a readable resolution on the same screen I looked at all those years ago I couldn‚Äôt help but feel A little scared, scared that this wouldn‚Äôt have amounted to anything, scared that Adam and the rest of our team had acted on a whim, then the first pictures came into focus, a blurry mess cataloguing the probes descent as it fell from the pockets opening slowly toward the ground, they came into focus as the computer loaded, pictures of impossible structures designed from materials that seemed wrong to look at, they came into focus as the computer loaded, hundreds black silhouettes painted these structures, they came into focus as the computer loaded, A massive monolith came into view as the probe swirled through air, it had writing on it, symbols that repeated over and over again, Adam paused the feed, A moment of intensive consideration washed over the room as the whole department saw one of the lines of text repeated millions of times across the titanic slab, the language was not human but its meaning was clear as day. I‚Äôve prayed every day that we interpreted it wrong. Although it wasn‚Äôt on a human the look of fear was unmistakable, although it wasn‚Äôt on human hands the act of prayer was unmistakable, although it wasn‚Äôt on the human body the act of death was unmistakable, although it wasn‚Äôt on the human mind the look of solitude was unmistakable and although it wasn‚Äôt of human creation the shape of a bomb was unmistakable. 

I wish we all interpreted this message differently but when Adam voiced his interpretation jokingly no one challenged him, i‚Äôve never heard a room so quiet, not in my own home, never in nature and not during my mothers wake. There had always been a theory that the red dust littering the lady was caused by one last great martian nuclear war eroding mountains, buildings and all traces of life, hell its a cool idea to someone billions of years its senior and if that was all we confirmed i‚Äôd be happy, unfortunately we learned why they did it. From our collective interoperation of the monolith, this was no war, it was a purposeful eradication of their species from their own volition a eradication that left nothing but a warning to any other sentient species, I don‚Äôt know how they figured it out but if they were willing to end their whole race than they must‚Äôve been certain, ill describe the final portion of the message so you can come to your own interpretation if theres any hope at all you don‚Äôt come to mine. 

Someone alive. 
Someone dead. 
A deity pushing someone away. 
Someone‚Äôs body decomposing. 
The mind is all that is left. 
The mind surrounded by darkness. 
The mind alone forever.

I‚Äôm scared, for myself but also for everyone i‚Äôve lost and care for, they don‚Äôt deserve this, I hope the martians were wrong, no one deserves this fate, life was a mistake.
