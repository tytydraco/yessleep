When I get sleep deprived, auditory hallucinations are the first indicator that I really need to get some rest. I first noticed it when I was about seven or eight years old, when me and my friends would compete to see who could stay up the longest. I would start to hear more in the room than just the group of obnoxious kids in the room and the blaring speakers powered by the Xbox.

When my body hits that wall, that numb feeling of my senses being submerged underwater, every part of my mind and body drooping heavily; that’s when the sounds begin. They start simple, a knock at the door, footsteps matching my pace just around the corner. Within a few hours, I start to hear the voices. It was never anything more than a “hello” over my shoulder or my even my name being called out from a distance.

It's gotten bad once before, during finals week my sophomore year of college. I had to stay up studying and finishing projects, all while working evenings as a prep cook at a small market on campus.

I’m not sure how long I was up, but I had been hearing voices for days. It got to the point where the line between sleep deprivation and reality began to blur. I normally could distinguish between the hallucinations and those around me, the voices in my head sounding slightly muted, almost compressed. This time, however, they got loud and clear, and I couldn’t tell if I heard something in my mind or my ear.

While dicing some chicken I nearly had a conversation with myself, responding to a “Hello, Mark!” and a “How are you?”. My manager saw me react to nothing and came over, noting the fatigue in my face and the slouch in my shoulders. He told me he’d take over and I should use the evening to get some sleep. I went home, ignoring the pitter patter of footsteps following me on my walk, and fell asleep immediately.

Something similar is happening again, the voices have come back, but this time its different. I’m suffering from a wave of insomnia. It’s been years since I had exams or deadlines or grades to worry about, so I’m not sure what’s causing it. I’ve tried melatonin, I’ve stopped drinking caffeine, and yet despite feeling like a bag of bricks, I just can’t get any sleep.

I think I’ve been awake for at least a week and a half, but I’m not totally sure. I’m still going to work, maintaining the front desk at an ER, and I’m still going about my day normally. I almost don’t even feel tired anymore.

When the voices started, they were normal. I walk past an open door and hear a beckoning “hey hey” from the darkness. I tell a leaving patient to have a good night and hear “You too, Mark” from behind me. I head off for lunch and hear those feet dragging behind me.

I understand these are normal symptoms of sleep deprivation, I’m sure some of you have experienced it to some degree. But a couple of days ago, something changed. The lines completely blurred; I can only be for sure that what I’m hearing is a hallucination if I am completely alone in a quiet room. They’ve started to become so real, not just in perception but in feeling.

Simple phrases have become whole sentences as well. “Where ya going? Can I come with?” when I’d leave for work. “I know you’re busy, but I need you to take a look at something over here” from the dark empty linen closet across the hall from my desk.

I chose to ignore it all, I don’t want to get caught looking crazy in public, so I don’t respond to anything unless I see a person speaking the words. But yesterday, I lost it. I was cooking myself dinner and from the living room I heard a loud sniff and then, “Fix me up a plate too while you’re at it”.

*“Shut the fuck up and leave me alone”* escaped me before I could think. A desperate plea for quiet.

Somehow, it did in fact leave me alone, for roughly 8 hours or so. The silence was deafening, I didn’t realize just how accustomed I had become to the noise.

I took advantage of this peace, despite feeling uneasy, and thought I might try and finally shut myself down.

That’s when I heard quiet giggles from the bathroom. I’d never heard anything like that before, and I ran to make sure nobody was in my apartment. My heart was racing, my face burning, as I rounded the corner and swung myself into the bathroom and towards the light switch.

It stopped abruptly as soon as I stepped over the threshold, and the door slammed behind me. Did my shirt catch the handle? Did I slip and knock the door with my foot? Was there a strong draft in here?

“You know it was me” rang in my ears, filling my skull and forcing me to the ground.

I closed my eyes for a second, focusing on nothing and trying to clear my brain. I stood up, straightened myself, not submitting to my crazy imagination. I round up some courage and walked back to my bedroom.

Since then, the voices have altered, they’re less frequent, but are mostly these mind-numbing shrieks. It sounds like someone is screaming right into my ear, I can almost feel their lips pressing against me, their spit hitting my neck. They are mostly quick, but some have lasted a whole minute, filling my head and making me feel hollow.

A couple times I’ve heard a loud bang in the other room, and have walked in to see a book or plate fallen off a table. Did I put it too close to the edge?

About an hour ago I decided I have to keep trying to sleep, it’s the only way out. Finally, I started to drift away, happy to know that this was coming to an end.

Just as I was about to release my annoying companions, I felt something grip my arm, sending me upright in bed. Did I bang it on the nightstand? I’ve been known to twitch a bit when falling asleep. There’s a deep purple bruise on my forearm now.

I’m not really sure what’s going on, but I think this overwhelming sleep deprivation is causing me to go insane. Is there anything I can do to finally get some sleep, or at least get rid of the foul noise in my head?
