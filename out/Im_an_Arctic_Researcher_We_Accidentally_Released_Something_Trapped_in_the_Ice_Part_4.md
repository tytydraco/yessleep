**June 21, 2021**

The realization that we were ticking time bombs weighed heavily over us. As the howling winds subsided, I felt compelled to break the eerie silence. I turned on the radio, and the static-filled airwaves filled our shelter. After a few adjustments, I managed to reach Outpost Aurora.

"Outpost Aurora, this is Noah Kalluk. Do you copy?" I called into the radio. After a moment of heart-pounding silence, Dr. Andersson's voice crackled to life.

"Noah! We've been trying to reach you. Are you and Becca alright?" She sounded relieved to hear us.

"Sonja, we're alive," I said, "but we're not exactly alright. We're holed up in a makeshift shelter after...an encounter."

The hesitation in my voice must have conveyed the gravity of our situation, for Dr. Andersson's tone became serious. "What kind of encounter?" she asked.

I took a deep breath before delving into our harrowing ordeal with the Ijiraq.

Dr. Andersson was silent for a long time, taking in the incredible tale. "That's...I don't know what to say. But we've had our own troubles here. The effects of the gas are becoming more pronounced. Symptoms are worsening. We're preparing for an immediate evacuation."

Her words sent my heart racing. "What about the Inuit communities?" I asked, concern gripping me.

"We're attempting to contact as many as we can," she responded. "Now, listen carefully. I've already radioed for an emergency evacuation of the outpost. The helicopter is arriving tomorrow at 0600 hours. We're pulling out as soon as it arrives. I urged you two to get back to base as soon as you can."

I glanced at Becca, who had been listening intently. She looked pale but nodded, indicating her agreement.

"We'll head back to base as soon as the storm lets up," I assured her, then added, "Be careful. If our theory about the gas is correct, its effects are much more than just physical."

There was a pause on the other end before Sonja replied, her voice filled with grim resolve. "We'll keep that in mind. Stay safe, you two, and hurry back."

—The journey back to Outpost Aurora was a grueling test of our endurance and sanity. The sled dogs, once full of vigor and enthusiasm, had started to behave oddly. They howled at the barren wasteland and growled at unseen threats, their eyes vacant and terrified. The potent stench of the gas seemed to be getting to them. As much as it filled me with dread, we had to press on, for the alternative was unthinkable.

Upon nearing the outpost, we were met with an unsettling silence, broken only by a plume of smoke ascending from the storage area. The site resembled a ghost town, devoid of its former liveliness. The once bustling scientific station was now unnaturally silent and desolate, nearly blending into the frozen, monochromatic landscape.

Dread coiled in my stomach as we approached the source of the smoke. Our worst fears were confirmed: the snowmobiles and the snow cat that were once neatly parked in storage were now reduced to a destroyed and smoldering heap.

Becca kept a firm grip on her rifle, her eyes darting around the surroundings. I could see her breath quicken, her gloved fingers turning white from the pressure she exerted on the weapon. I felt the cold handle of Katak's knife in my hand.

"I don't like this," she whispered.

“Yeah, I know what you mean…” I muttered.

Cautiously, we made our way into the main building, our flashlight beams cutting through the oppressive darkness. We were met with a sight that will forever be etched into my mind. We froze in our tracks as the light fell upon the gruesomely mutated bodies of our colleagues.

Their bodies were grotesquely melded into half-human, half-animal monstrosities. Fur sprouted from their skin in patches, their limbs elongated and clawed like a polar bear, and some bore the spiraled tusks of a narwhal protruding grotesquely from their distorted faces. Their eye sockets were empty, a dark void where a spark of life should have been, echoing a now all too familiar cruel fate.

Becca stifled a scream, her hand flying to her mouth to suppress the horrified gasp that threatened to escape. I felt a wave of nausea wash over me, bile rising in my throat. The sight was monstrous, a scene straight out of the darkest of nightmares.

Our hearts pounded as we sprinted through the dimly lit, eerily quiet corridors. Our destination was the radio room. If we could reach it, we could send a distress signal and hopefully get the help we needed. When we finally reached the room, our hopes crashed. The room was a wreck. Wires hung from the ceiling like entrails, sparking erratically. The radio equipment was shattered, smashed to pieces. The air was filled with the acrid smell of burnt electronics. Everything had been methodically and thoroughly destroyed.

The room was filled with an unsettling, almost hypnotic, murmur. It took a moment for our flashlights to find the source. Dr. Andersson was slumped over the radio console. Her skin was a mottled, bluish-gray, waterlogged and bloated, giving her the macabre appearance of a corpse fished from icy waters. Her clothes were sodden, clinging to her form, while strands of hair plastered to her face and her open eyes stared blankly, a chilling resemblance to a drowned victim's final gaze.

Her throat moved rhythmically, producing an awful semblance of speech. The last words she ever said to us echoed throughout the room. "Stay safe… You two… And hurry back…"

Her vacant eyes stared blankly at the radio console, her hand still clutching the receiver as if her final act was an attempt to call for help. It was a chilling sight. The site director was dead, yet her body kept broadcasting her final utterances, like a macabre puppet show. It was clear that there would be no contact with the outside world.

Becca was the first to move. She approached Dr. Andersson slowly, a look of profound sadness on her face. She reached out and gently detached the receiver from Sonja's rigid grip. The distress call ceased abruptly, leaving us in an eerie silence that hung heavy in the air.

"She lured us here... No help is coming…" Becca whispered, her voice shaking, the enormity of the situation crashing down on her.

"We can't stay here," I declared. Although neither of us wished to linger, we needed to gather supplies.

We scavenged through the base, gathering what we could carry. The infirmary provided us with essential medical supplies. The mess hall offered canned goods, dehydrated meals, and water. In the equipment room, we found survival gear - thermal blankets, flares, extra clothing, a compact camping stove, and an ice ax.

As we cautiously navigated the labyrinthine corridors, I voiced the question gnawing at me. "Why us?" I asked, glancing at her. "Why are we the only ones who haven't transformed?"

"It doesn't make sense," I muttered, thinking out loud. "We were exposed to the gas before most of them. Why haven't we turned?"

After a long silence, Becca broke the quiet with a theory. "Maybe... maybe the gas affects those who have been at the base longer," she suggested, her voice barely a whisper.

I looked at her, taken aback. "What do you mean?"

"Erika was the most senior member of the station. She's been there the longest," Becca explained. "It would explain why she was the first to be affected."

I nodded, slowly understanding. "And since I'm the newest member, that would make me the last to be affected."

"Exactly," she affirmed, but there was a hesitation in her voice, a reluctance that I couldn't ignore.

"So, Becca," I said, stopping to face her in the dwindling light, "how long have you been at Aurora?"

"I’ve been here for… a couple months," she confessed under her breath.

“A couple months?” I asked, surprised.

Suddenly, everything fell into place: the details I had overlooked before. Her low rank at the base, her social isolation...

“You’re a rookie, aren’t you?” I finally said.

"I’m not a rookie," she protested weakly, "I'm just... not as experienced as the others." Her gaze flicked up to meet mine, an uncertain smile playing on her lips.

“I worked in the oil and gas industry straight out of college. It was good pay, but I hated what I was doing. I jumped at the chance when I saw they were looking for someone with drilling experience to work at a climate research station,” she desperately tried to explain.

I studied her face in the dim, cold light, her words echoing in the icy, harsh silence.

I sighed, reached out, and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "What does it matter? We're all each other's got," I said. "And I don't think I could ask for a better partner in all of this."

Becca gave me a weak but appreciative smile. "Thanks, Noah," she said, her voice barely audible over the howling wind. "I feel the same."

We stood in the harsh chill for a moment, united in our struggle for survival.

After gathering everything we needed, we left Outpost Aurora behind for good. The imposing structure, once a hub of scientific discovery and now a place of horror and death, loomed in our rear-view as we set off into the wilderness. Our destination was unclear, but we knew we had to keep moving, away from the memories that haunted us and towards the slimmest chance of safety.

**June 22, 2021**

The following day was the most challenging yet, testing our resolve and shattering the last bits of normalcy we held onto. The huskies, our reliable companions and our sole means of transport through this icy hellscape, began to succumb to the poison that had invaded their bodies. They couldn’t even stand anymore, let alone pull a sled. Their fur started to shed rapidly, revealing unnatural growths and deformities that seemed to writhe beneath their skin.

Their pained whimpers and growls echoed throughout the snow-filled air, a reminder of the horror we faced. Their once sparkling eyes were now clouded over. The sight of them suffering was heart-wrenching. These creatures, who had once bounded through the snow with joyous abandon, were now crippled with pain and fear.

Becca was visibly distraught. She spent most of the day tending to them, desperately trying to alleviate their suffering. But the more time she spent with them, the more she seemed to realize the grim truth - there was no coming back for them.

I found her kneeling in the snow beside the dogs, her face pale and her eyes red from tears. "Noah," she said, her voice breaking, "I... I can't let them suffer. They deserve better than this."

I knew what she was implying, but the thought of it filled me with dread. "Becca... are you sure? Maybe there's still a way--"

She shook her head, cutting me off. "You've seen what this...thing does to living being. I won't let that happen to my dogs."

Her determination was clear, but the pain in her eyes was heartbreaking.

I offered to help, ready to share this unbearable burden with her, but she refused. She shook her head, a hollow look in her eyes. "They're my dogs, Noah," she said. Her voice was strained but resolute. "I should be the one to do it."

There was a finality in her voice that brooked no argument. With a heavy heart, I nodded.

I said my goodbyes, thanking each dog for their companionship and strength, for carrying us across the endless expanse of ice and snow. I gave Becca a supportive squeeze on the shoulder before I stepped away.

I retreated to give her some privacy. As I walked away, the harsh wind bit into my skin.

Then came the sounds that echoed across the frozen landscape - the gunshots, four in total. Each one was a piercing reminder of the cruel reality we were living in.

After what felt like an eternity, Becca walked towards me, her face devoid of any emotion. Her eyes, however, betrayed the immense grief she was feeling. As she wiped away the last of her tears, I saw a hardness in her gaze that hadn't been there before. "Let's keep moving," she said, her voice hollow.

\-----We spent the early morning hours studying the weather-proof map. A compass indicated our direction and also acted as a paperweight. The situation was grim. Assuming every village in the area had been devastated by the gas, the closest human settlement was the town of Utqiagvik, almost 100 miles away. Even in the best of conditions, the journey would be arduous. On foot in our current predicament seemed utterly impossible.

The truth was unavoidable. We were isolated, alone in the vast, frozen wilderness, our only lifelines erased by an unseen force we were only beginning to comprehend. A profound silence settled over us, as we stared at the map, the enormity of our predicament sinking in.

As we sat in silence, I noticed Becca tracing a route with her finger, her brows furrowed in concentration. I looked at her, a glimmer of hope igniting within me. "Becca?"

She turned to me, a determined look on her face. "I used to work on an oil rig, not too far from here," she said.

She pointed out a spot on the map, a little dot off the northern coast of Alaska. "It’s about a 30-mile journey northeast of here," she explained. "We'd have to kayak there. We can hug the coast. It’ll take two, maybe three days. If we’re lucky, we’ll run into one of the rig's crew boats."

Her proposal was a risky one. Kayaking through Arctic waters was a dangerous proposition. We would have to navigate the freezing, unpredictable ocean.

“I don’t know about this… Who knows how the gas has affected sea life. Hell, a rogue wave could plunge us into the icy waters,” I expressed my doubts.

"We don’t have many choices," Becca replied, her voice firm. "We can either try for Utqiagvik and likely die of exposure and exhaustion before we reach it, or we take a chance on the rig. I know the second option is risky, but at least there’s a chance."

I looked back at the map, my eyes fixated on the tiny dot representing the rig. The weight of our decision hung heavily in the air.

Finally, I met Becca's eyes, finding a look of frightened determination. I nodded, "The rig it is, then."

**June 23, 2021**

Our two-person inflatable kayak felt like a tiny speck on the vast, endless sea, dwarfed by the towering icebergs and the shadowy mutated leviathans that lurked beneath the water's surface. A chilling wind whistled through the desolate landscape, the only sound other than the rhythmic splash of our paddles against the cold water.

In those hours, the line between night and day blurred, the sun never dipping far enough to plunge us into darkness. Time became measured in strokes of the paddle and the rhythmic rise and fall of the ocean.

We made slow progress, taking turns paddling and resting, stealing moments of sleep when we could. We nibbled at our rations, preserving what we could for the uncertain journey ahead.

On the second day, a light drizzle soaked us to the bone, the biting cold gnawing at our fingers and faces. As we huddled around the map to determine our bearings, I noticed Becca shivering beside me. Her face was pale, her lips tinted blue, and her speech was slightly slurred.

"Becca, are you alright?" I asked, my voice barely audible above the howling wind.

"I'm fine, " she insisted, but her chattering teeth betrayed her.

It was clear I need to get her out of the cold and fast. Searching the shoreline, I spotted a dark recess in the cliffside. "We're going ashore," I declared, veering our kayak towards the land. Becca didn’t argue, her strength sapped by the relentless cold.

We managed to pull our kayaks onto the rocky shore, the land a welcome reprieve from the icy waters. The cave we found provided some shelter from the wind, its mouth wide enough to prevent the buildup of snow.

Once inside, I turned my attention to Becca. I removed her soaking wet outer layer and wrapped her in a thermal blanket.

I pulled out our compact camping stove from the supplies, grateful that we had it. A fire would've been ideal, but in these conditions, it was next to impossible to start one. The small, portable heater emitted a soft glow as I ignited it, its heat radiating into the cold cave.

Next, I removed her gloves and snow boots, inspecting her extremities. My heart sank at the sight of her fingers and toes: white, hard, and numb, with a waxy appearance - all signs of frostbite.

Using the first aid kit we scavenged from the outpost, I carefully cleaned and bandaged her frostbitten digits. Trying to reassure her, I said, "It's not too severe. You'll recover."

We huddled together under the thermal blanket to conserve heat. Becca slipped in and out of consciousness, her body fighting the hypothermia.

In her delirious state, Becca turned to me, her blue eyes clouded with confusion and fear. "Noah," she murmured, her voice barely a whisper. "Can you... Can you sing for me?"

"Sing?" I was taken aback. The last thing I'd been expecting was a request for a song. But, maybe in her confused state, she was seeking some comfort.

She nodded, her gaze unfocused. "Something in Inuit," she requested.

I thought about what to sing to her. I remembered as a child, I'd stubbornly resist sleep until my mother returned from work, gripped by an irrational fear that she wouldn't be there when I awoke. To calm me, Grandma Anuri would sing an ancient Inuit lullaby, a song about the undying love between the moon and the sea, about their eternal dance and infinite patience.

Clearing my throat, I started singing. My voice echoed softly in the cave. The lullaby, which I hadn't sung in years, flowed out in a gentle rhythm.

"Ilati qaangiutsaaq, Taqqiq, taqqiq ukiurpaaq..." "The moon shines brightly, the moon, the moon watches over..."

My voice grew stronger with each note, the lullaby's story of strength, love, and resilience reflecting our circumstances. Becca's eyes fluttered closed, her face relaxing slightly as the song washed over her.

I watched her as I sang, the portable heater casting a soft glow on her pale face. The lullaby seemed to bring her some peace, her shaking lessening a bit as she leaned into me, her head resting on my shoulder. Her breathing started to sync with the rhythm of the song, slow and steady.

It was a long, nerve-wracking night. I tried to stay awake, keeping a watchful eye on her and praying for the best.

\-----I woke to the dull gray of early morning, my body stiff from the cold, and the warmth beside me missing. I shot upright, looking around the small space of the cave.

"Becca?" I called out, my voice bouncing off the stone walls.

No response. The cave was empty, save for the remnants of our meager supplies. My heart pounded in my chest as my gaze landed on the thermal blanket discarded on the hard cave floor.

I stumbled to my feet, grabbing the flashlight and scanning the cavern. There was no sign of her.

Rushing outside, I found a set of bare footprints in the snow. Each impression was stained with a speck of crimson blood. Becca's clothes were scattered along the path, torn and soaked with fresh snow. I followed the footprints, my stomach churning as I collected her discarded garments.

The trail led me away from the cave, winding along the icy shoreline. The morning light cast a pale glow on the icy landscape, but there was no sign of Becca. My breath misted in the cold air as I followed her trail, the only indication that life still existed in this barren, frozen expanse.

A sense of urgency pushed me to move faster, though the biting cold protested against every step. I knew exactly what this meant. This was paradoxical undressing, a known phenomenon of late-stage hypothermia. The person, in their confused and disoriented state, feels an intense sensation of heat and starts to undress, often leading to their demise in the freezing temperatures.

The blood stains in the snow grew fainter and then disappeared entirely, but the footprints continued, their direction unwavering. My mind was in a whirl, but I didn't have time to dwell on it. I knew what I had to do. With a determined stride, I started to follow the footprints, praying that I wasn't too late.

After what felt like hours, I saw her in the distance, a fragile silhouette against the white expanse. Her bare skin was almost the same color as the snow, tinged blue in the morning chill. Her auburn hair, once neatly braided, was now a wild mess of strands whipping in the biting wind.

"Becca!" I shouted, my voice a desperate echo against the icy desolation.

She didn't turn around. She staggered, barely upright, as she continued her aimless journey through the snow.

As I approached, the wind carried fragments of a haunting melody to my ears. Becca was muttering, almost singing, in fluent Inuit, a language that just days earlier, she barely knew two words of.

“Ijiraq paalliguqsiksanikka…” “Ijiraq, you come in the night…”

“Ullulluni pivalliannginnartut…” “Filling our homes with terror and fright…”

“Tuqqaqsiksauni tuqvitaqtuksamikka…” “Your cold empty eyes peering deep within…”

“Ajulqartaaalu niqauliakpaktut…” “Your wickedness lurking in the darkness…”

“Putitugait pivallianiarutikkut…” “And we can do nothing but watch…”

Summoning every ounce of courage, I stepped forward and gently turned her around to face me. The sight that met my eyes was worse than any nightmare I could have ever imagined. Becca, once the epitome of strength and vitality, stood in front of me resembling a frostbitten corpse. Her once vibrant blue eyes were replaced with empty sockets, from which emerged squirming tendrils that undulated in the cold morning air. Her face was a canvas of jagged lines and fractures, resembling the intricate tattoos we had discovered on the ancient mummies at the drill site.

In her hand, she held a scalpel from the med kit, its metallic surface gleaming ominously under the weak sunlight. She raised her hand, the scalpel glinting menacingly. She stared at her other hand with an unnerving fascination. I watched in horror as she positioned the scalpel over one of her fingers.

"Becca, no!" I cried out, but my plea was drowned by the howling wind.

Suddenly, she brought the scalpel down to her hand, severing one of her frostbitten fingers with a chilling efficiency. The sound of flesh being cut open echoed ominously in the frigid silence, a horrid, squelching noise that was both wet and grating, reminiscent of a butcher carving a slab of meat. There was no cry of pain, no reaction to the gruesome act she was performing on herself.

As the severed digit fell to the snowy ground, an overpowering stench hit me, an unholy blend of decay and brine that reminded me of rotting fish left out in the sun.

She continued the gruesome task with a grim determination, each slice of the scalpel followed by the horrible thud of a finger falling onto the snow.

And then, the horror compounded. The amputated fingers started to wriggle on the icy ground, transforming into tentacled monstrosities that writhed as if taunting me with their grotesque existence.

I racked my brain to make sense of what I was witnessing. The old tales of Sedna, the Inuit sea goddess, echoed in my mind. Cast into the sea by her father, her fingers were cut off as she tried to cling to his kayak. As each finger hit the water, they transformed into sea creatures. This was like some twisted parody of the legend.

Becca cocked her head towards me, the tendrils in her eyes pulsating with a strange, unnatural rhythm. A haunting smirk played on her lips, a perverse mockery of the confident smile I had grown accustomed to seeing. She raised her mutilated hand to me, her thumb and forefinger forming a sinister beckoning gesture.

Her voice, when she spoke, was a haunting echo of the woman I had known. “Qaniqsiutitagmit…” "Join us…"
