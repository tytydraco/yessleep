I don't know where even to start because there is no beginning. My name is unimportant as I don't want any of this. I just woke up, looked over, and had two phones (My iPhone 13 and what can only be described as a brick that can text). And of course, it's not anyone's phone that I know of. I live alone with my two cats and I, am not a very popular man so I don't have much foot traffic in the apartment either. I thought that I could look through the phone and find more information about whos or what it was but nothing. No contacts, no messages, no SIM, nothing. I just thought that I could keep the phone as a burner for a bit, because why not? But unfortunately for me, I did get a text on that old phone.

"Where am I?"

That was the first text I got. I didn't respond because how was I supposed to? I thought at first it was just some joke. I texted my friends to see if they knew anything about the phone that appeared but none of them had even the sliver of an idea on what was happening. I thought "Ok, maybe that was it. Maybe that was a text that was automated or something just to get me to respond."

"Please"

That was the second text that received. This one made me feel weird. I thought that i could just ignore it at first and go through my days with a new phone but i couldnt.

"Please"

"Please"

"PLease"

PLEASE

I couldn't take it anymore after the forth time.

"Home" i sent back.

"Home? Where is home?"

"Home. Where you are."

"ok, i guess this is home."

I didn't like how fast the other party accepted my response,

"Where are you?" I asked

"Home" they responded.

I stopped responding after that. Theres no reason for this to continue after that. And it didn't. A week had passed then i got another text.

"Where?"

"Dont you mean where are you?" I responded.

"Yeah, i guess."

"Well where are you?"

If i hadn't asked that question then i wouldn't have to post this. I just wanted to know. I was curious.

"\[REDACTED\]"

"How do you know that address?"

"It's where i live"

"No, no, i live there."

"Im in the apartment right now."

"Theres nobody here. Except me."

"Im in the kitchen"

"There's nobody here. Except me." I repeated.

"Im in the kitchen" They repeated

When i went to investigate the kitchen i didn't see anything. The fridge was still there and the stove and everything but i could not wrap my head around what the texts could be saying. Then, i walked towards the fridge. I couldn't. I stopped in my tracks. I looked at the fridge then down at the burner phone.

"What are you doing?"

I stop, look at my phone then to the other.

"Please leave"

As soon as i left the kitchen it felt like a metric ton of pressure were released. I looked back and I almost froze. I thought that I left the kitchen but I'm right back at the fridge. I looked down at my phone and there it was, almost on cue.

"Youre turn."

I looked at the opened fridge and nothing had changed. I looked back down and I saw that the texts were both sent at the same time. I just chalked it up to being me losing track of time. I just moved on.

"Im going to sleep."

"OK!" I sent back.

It was like I was texting an old friend at this point. I just went over to my computer and started typing this. In the end I just need help. I don't know what to do. Im going to be up all night responding on this thread. I don't want to go to bed. I don't want to check the phone anymore unless I get a text. I will update in the thread. Hope anyone and I mean anyone can help me here.
