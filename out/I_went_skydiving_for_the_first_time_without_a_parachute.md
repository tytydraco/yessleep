I am a 24-year-old male, and I have a girlfriend; she is 23 and convinced me to go skydiving. I always hated the idea of jumping out of a plane, but she somehow got me to do it.  
  
The day we went, everything went well. We barely had any traffic and arrived there in just 30 minutes. The pilot checked everything and let us on the plane. There were 4 other people with us.  
  
We reached the height of 10,000 ft (3048 m), and the first guy jumped out, doing a backflip (I wouldn't even do that if my life depended on it). The second guy did a dive, and the third did a jumping jack. Now the only other woman jumped; she just jumped normally. Then my girlfriend jumped, turned back, and yelled, "Wooohooo, so much fun!" Now it was my turn; I just jumped and closed my eyes.  
  
Everyone was supposed to pull their parachute; they all did, except me. Realization struck as I noticed I was still carrying my backpack, not a parachute. I screamed, but they didn't hear me.  
  
I remembered what to do in such a situation: aim for soft things like snow, hay, or forests, then position yourself upright and prepare for impact because your feet and legs will take the whole fall. Before that, cover your head and organs. I put the backpack on my head and my arms around my body to protect my internal organs. I was preparing for impact, thinking about what would happen if I didn't survive. I tried to recall all the happy times in my life.  
  
I remembered what I wanted to do still. The impact came; at first, it didn't hurt, but then I started screaming. I found myself in the middle of a forest, somehow alive. I think I landed on a lot of grass, but I still couldn't believe it.  
  
I shouldn't let the scream come through as I pulled off the backpack; I saw many shadow-like creatures staring at me. They had red eyes and looked dead serious. Then everything went black.  
  
When I woke up again, I was tied to a sign, and many of these shadowy things stood around me. I begged them to help me, but they just stared at me with their eyes wide and bright red.  
  
I was sobbing now, saying, "Please help me! My legs are completely broken. I jumped from a plane without a parachute. Please help me!" Out of nowhere, another one of these beings came and said in an echoing voice, "Ohh, but why did you do that?" It was really confusing because it sounded distorted. I answered, "You can speak?"  
  
It answered, "Only me; I am the leader, and we want to help you." My body still didn't feel the whole pain because I was still in shock. It said, "Is the pain already there completely?" I answered, "No, fortunately not." Then it struck me, and I felt the whole pain. I screamed in agonizing pain, "AHHHHHHH." It said, "Oh, now it is happening." I was crying and screaming. It said, "Hey, you will die, so stop that whole screaming thing." Then it touched me, and everything went black.  
  
I woke up feeling different; the pain was gone, and the leader said, "You are one of us now!"  
  
I ran to my home, and I was faster than usual (probably because my legs weren't broken anymore). I looked through the window and saw my girlfriend crying. I went into the house and went up when I heard her call the police and lock the door. Whatever I was now, I was not the same, and I just blacked out.  
  
I woke up with my girlfriend lying on the floor, and she was dead. I just don't want to hurt any more people, but now the police is here, and I am feeling dizzy. I guess whatever they think awaits them, they are not ready for "It."
