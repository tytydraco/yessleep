In my small city, there’s a abandoned theater just right off the main street. I discovered it by just exploring the town and noticing a broken window, i assumed some other teens broke into it to explore it.

 I called my girlfriend because she loves abandoned places and i told her about this one, she brought her friend which lets call kayla. 

We go in and it seems like a chill untouched place, it looked like some people attempted to renovate it as the second floor ceiling was entirely ripped off.

 The fire extinguishers were last serviced in 2014 so thats when we assumed it was abandoned. We explore the giant basement which had a indoor tennis court thingy along with showers. But there was a weird part about it, there was this table which was long and had a giant concrete slab on it. 

We thought it was strange but we left later after, We left through a door that could only be opened through the inside. Me my gf and kayla came back a week later and noticed it was still opened, When we walked in we all noticed footprints that weren’t there before. 

We know because we all had nike shoes with the signature af1 design at the bottom. We looked around the first floor and kayla noticed that one of the rooms had a human poop on the floor, It looked like it was fresh like it wasn’t dried out or anything.

 All three of us head to the basement and we walk around, We see this 6’10-7ft sillouhette and we all run to the back of the basement. the sillouhette was near the only steps entering the basement blocking us.

 Im 5’10 and this thing is atleast a foot taller than me from a far perspective. Then we were all huddled together and could hear objects getting thrown around the corner. We said yolo and ran out, A pool noodle was thrown at me while i ran up the stairs. 

But we were stupid enough to stay in the building, Me and my gf walk around upstairs kayla wanders off.

 20 minutes later she goes missing, We spam call her and we couldn’t find her until we walked up the stairs leading to the roof and we find her passed out laying on the rooftop. 

A folded paper towel was sitting on her mouth and we both carried kayla down until we exited. We walked her to a grass opening and set her down, She wakes up about an hour later and apparently she got chloroformed by whatever this thing was.

a few months later i went back alone and walked around, i felt like something was following me. everytime i stopped walking i heard a creak from below, Not like a floor creaking, like someone is walking in the floor below you creaking. i quickly ran out and as i was running away. I heard the door slam shut. 

People may say it was a squatter, But what squatter doesnt have trash laying around. What squatter is 7ft tall? What squatter has access to chloroform??

 What kind of squatter sleeps on a concrete slab.
