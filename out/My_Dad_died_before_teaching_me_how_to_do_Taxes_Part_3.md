# The mouse is gone. I’m not sure where it went or if it will survive.

After Elizabeth sent me to bed, I lay awake staring at random videos on my phone trying to decide if I should make a trip to my dad's house or not. We had spent the majority of the evening arguing over this.

Elizabeth felt that since we had sent him out there by himself, we should at least check to make sure he was okay. I pointed out that he was a professional and could handle these situations. I figured he probably just didn’t feel like checking back in with his work after dealing with my dads house.

She agreed that I was probably right but that there was also a chance that he had gotten hurt and couldn’t get help. I mean, I agreed that it was possible, but I just didn’t want to deal with it. I told her she was free to go look for herself, but I was going to wait and see if he got back to me later.

I clicked my phone off and laid it on my nightstand. Then I turned my lamp off and snuggled under my blanket. A rustling came from the box next to my phone and I remembered I had the light on to keep the mouse warm. I didn’t feel like turning it back on through and figured he would be fine for the night. I turned over and let his occasional rustle lull me to sleep.

‘Thuummp’

A thud somewhere in my house woke me. I sat up in bed and turned my light on, glancing around expecting to see a cat or raccoon had somehow broken in. There was nothing disturbed as far as I could see. My next thought was Elizabeth maybe falling and getting hurt.

I hopped up and stumbled out to the living room which was quiet and also undisturbed. Elizabeth lay peacefully on the couch, sleeping. I did a quick walk through and circled back to my room wondering now if I had just dreamed the sound.

Back in bed I looked at my phone, it was a little past 4am and I didn’t think I would sleep much longer. I decided to hop on my pc and play a little Tarkov. It was my favorite game. Elizabeth used to watch me sometimes. Once she said it reminded her of a ‘Professional Organization Game’ The point being it was teaching you how to organize. I found this description funny and spot on.

None of my friends were online so my drive to play was short lived. It was better with 2 people at least. I switched over to Farming Simulator but grew bored pretty quickly. Finally, I gave up and went to the kitchen in search of food.

It was now around 7ish, and Elizabeth was up when I walked in. She was holding a cup of coffee and nibbling on toast. I decided to join her and got my own cup of coffee and toast to nibble on.

She was quiet and I knew why. Mornings were not her favorite and she often had an attitude after awakening. Her problem was she didn’t realize it and thought she was fine but everyone around her would describe her as very angry.

She told me that it bothered her because she honestly felt fine in the morning and didn't notice her own attitude and anger, so she was bewildered to find that people saw her that way. So, she chose to stay quiet until she felt fully alert and awake to avoid any altercations.

“How is the mouse?” She asked quietly. She had asked every day so far but this morning I had not checked on him yet.

“I don’t know, I have to go check.” I said and turned to the sink to get a little water.

Elizabeth pulled a cracker from the box on the counter and followed me to the bedroom. I picked up the box and placed it on the bed for us both to peer into. I reached for the gauze pads I used for blankets and found the space empty. My eyes darted across the whole box several times trying to locate him.

“He’s gone?” Elizabeth asked.

“I…Uh…Well, yeah, seems so.” I stuttered.  “He must have gotten better and climbed out of the box.”

Elizabeth picked up the box and started towards the trash can with it but something in me said no. “Wait! Wait! Let’s keep it just in case he comes back up in the house still unwell.”

She looked at the box and then me and shook her head but brought it back over to my bed. Maybe she didn’t understand, I didn’t either, but I still felt protective of the mouse. I needed a place to keep him if he came back up.

“It’s sad, Felix, that you would care more for a mouse than a man.” Elisabeth tsked.

It was like a punch to my gut. Her words knocked the wind out of me as they sank in like knives. I wanted to lash out and say something hurtful, maybe call her a bitch but I didn’t. I held my tongue.

She was right. Here I was worried about the wellbeing of a mouse. That I technically tried to kill with my trap in the first place, and not the man inspecting my dad's death scene. I needed to get over myself and start acting like… An Adult.

“Okay! Okay! We can go here in a few. Just let me chill for a minute, Elizabeth.” I said through clenched teeth. I was still agitated by her words and just needed a moment to deal with it alone.

She left the room, closing the door behind her and I laid back on my bed. I closed my eyes and just breathed deeply in and out. I opened my eyes and let my head relax to the side. I was now looking through my slightly ajar bathroom door. The lights were off leaving the room dark other than the light from my room.

I just stared straight ahead towards the wall for a while. Then I started to feel weird, like something was wrong or out of place but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The feeling grew worse and then I saw it.

I was staring into two white eyes. My lovely brain had first tried to explain them away as lights in the bathroom, but I became more aware and as I did the eyes grew larger it seemed. I sat up in bed still staring at them and I felt my heart begin to race. Its pounding was becoming loud enough to hear in my ears.

I raised my hands but instantly lowered them unsure of what I planned to do. My breath caught in my throat as I realized they were growing in size because they were coming towards me. I scooted back on my bed up to the wall as they passed the threshold of the bathroom to my room.

I needed to run and get away, but I was paralyzed with fear. I didn’t know what it was or what it wanted but I felt my life was coming to its end. They paused at the edge of my bed, floating there like two white orbs. They rushed at me, I blinked as they made contact with my eyes and then they were gone.

I felt violated and wrong. Whatever it was had gone through my body and read all my secrets. Knew everything there was to know about me. It had taken all MY information and left.

Elizabeth walked in moments later and I described it to her. She thinks I am just stressed and had a waking nightmare. I want to believe her, but I really don’t. I have no idea what's happening anymore. I am terrified of everything now.

Despite my oddly terrifying experience, I still had to go with Elizabeth to check dad's house. She insisted it was the right thing to do and I had to agree. So, off we went to my dear old dads.

There were no vehicles parked outside, this was a good sign as I doubt an exterminator would show up on foot. They have too much equipment to haul around to be walking to their jobs. This eased my worries.

Once again, I paused when going to open the door. Elizabeth took the lead this time and I followed her in. The house was just as it had been before. I couldn’t see anything moved around or messed with in any way.

Elizabeth led us straight to the closet but stopped short and stared at the knob. I figured like me she was worried about what lay on the other side. I recalled all the little eyes staring at me before she pulled me out. I couldn’t tell if my feelings were messing with the memory, but they had appeared hungry. Hungry little eyes, instinctively I shivered at the thought.

She reached out slowly and twisted the handle pulling the door open. Quickly she flipped the light switch right inside the door and the room lit up. There were no bodies at the bottom of the stairs. The blood stains remained as they were before and everything else seemed fine, though the cabinet was open, and a jacket was hanging out.

I recalled Elizabeth hanging a jacket up before and closing it, so this meant someone had indeed been down here since then. Elizabeth backed up and I made my way down to fix the jacket. As I did this I kicked something up on the floor I had not noticed before. It was another piece of paper like we had found before. Same writing style and doodle of a rat; ‘Meat The Rats’.

I thought we had taken it home with us, but I must have been wrong. I folded it up and stuck it in my jeans then continued to put the jacket away. When I turned back around, I glanced at the hole beneath the stairs and saw four little eyes peeking back at me. ‘Yes, hungry eyes. Very hungry eyes.’ With that thought I rushed back upstairs and shut the door.

“Have you checked your dad's room for any clues to the rats?” Elizabeth asked. I shook my head and headed down the hallway towards his room. I hadn’t been there since before he died. Usually we hung out in the living room or went out to eat when spending time together.

His room was a lot like mine, as in bare. He had his bed, nightstand and lamp. A dresser and a desk for his own laptop which was dusty looking so he must not have been using it for anything.

Elizabeth walked over to the nightstand, flickered on the lamp, and opened the drawer. From where I stood at the foot of his bed, I could see a hunting knife, scissors, and medication. She picked it up to examine and stated, “Blood-pressure” before laying it back down.

I turned to his dresser and opened the top drawer. I riffled through socks and underwear and came up empty. It was the same for the next 3 drawers.

After searching his desk and finding nothing I decided to check his closet just in case. This is where the fun begins.

I opened the door and saw he had just a few things hanging off to the left side. The right side was bare, but the floor had a blue bucket with a nylon string stretched across the top. In the middle of this string was cheese.

The bottom of the bucket was littered with crackers, cheese, and bread pieces all torn up. Why was this here and what was it? Did my dad do this or the exterminator? It looked like it could be a trap so that rats would climb in, but the sides would be too slick for them to crawl back up. There were no rats in it though. Also why was it in my dad's closet and not the basement where the rats were?

Then I noticed a hole behind the bucket in the wall. The rats must be trying to move into the house, so the bucket was here to catch and deter them. I needed to get in touch with the exterminator and see what his plans were.

Elizabeth thought it best to just leave it and go home. We could call the exterminator again and ask him about it.

On the way home Elizabeth kept glancing at me while driving. I ignored it but wondered why. Did she want to talk now? Did she think I was crazy after the incident I had before? Did she miss me? I wanted to know but it's not bad enough to ask yet.

Elizabeth called the exterminators and left a message to call us back. I guess all we can do is wait until they get back to us. I’m not sure how long that will be or how long we should wait before finding another one. I mean they gave me thirty days to figure something out and I’m no closer yet.

Maybe it would be best to let them condemn it. I don’t know. I feel like this is all too much of a mess for a twenty-one-year-old to have to figure out. Plus, the weird shit that keeps happening! Those eyes that violated me… They took something from me, but I don't know what. I just know it was wrong on so many levels.
