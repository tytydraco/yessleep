I arrived at work [three days ago.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11neogc/i_took_a_shortcut_to_work_no_one_else_is_here/) I’m still here. The doors locked from the outside and the staircases are a mindless spiral to nowhere. I have been through a lot and I don’t know how much more of it I can take. Still this place needs to be documented. The public needs to know what happens here. So please bear with me.

I spent the first night huddled in a conference room with a desk jammed against the handle. A small window in the center of the door was my only vantage point into the dark room outside. Shadows played tricks over the water coolers and other crap on the shelves. The lights went out at ten. I guess my mind used sound to fill in the gaps. 

The creaks and groans of an unknown electrical system mixed in with the still unidentifiable female voices that snaked through the pipes. At one point, I heard footsteps. Then two people talking. Then there was a visceral shout so real that it almost got me to break camp and investigate. Then silence. 

The temperature dropped below freezing. I could see my breath. I found some jackets in the back and used them as blankets. It’s an eerie fucking feeling wearing someone else’s clothes. Especially not knowing the owners or their story. The fabric smells like mothballs and the leather stinks like decay. But warmth is warmth and frostbite is the last thing anyone needs to deal with when they’re trapped.

My cell phone battery died. So that part’s just fucked. This story is coming to you live and uncut from a piece o’ shit Linux from who-the-hell knows when. The keys are sticky and the monitors are covered with a thin layer of dust. But there’s hundreds strewn about. They all still connect to the Internet, albeit very slowly, so might as well put one of them to use. Midas whale, as my old coworker used to say. 

Ah. That’s the other thing. Jamie was here. 

I woke up in the morning to a panicked knock. The commotion pulled me out from my hidey-hole and into the general ‘bullpen’ of the office desks. I looked into the glass hallway and caught our esteemed head of accounting about to put his fist through the divider. He laughed when he saw me. I never liked Jamie. But I can’t tell you the relief of seeing that old rat fucker’s worried wrinkled face. 

“Open up.”

I thought he was there to say the prank was over. I thought he would say we’re going home. I ran over and pulled open the door like a host at a party. He collapsed at my feet in a heap. There were scratches on his face. Blood decorated his blazer. I pulled up a rolling chair and helped him sit down. I tried to speak before he cut me off. 

“How long have you been here?” he asked. 

“Two days.” I answered. 

“Did you take the tunnel?”

The question made me mad. This man made more money in a day than most did in months. He needed the shortcut? In his sixty thousand dollar car? With the heat blaring, the gas tank full, and two ten dollar mocha-motherfucker double fisting both cup holders? I digress.

“Yes.”

“Yeah. Me too.”

I disappeared into the men’s room to find some gauze. Our old office kept bandages along with mouthwash and other common toiletries. This one was the same. I came back and found Jamie splayed across a desk with a pant leg rolled to the top. A long gash slipped down from his thigh to his calf. He grabbed the gauze out of my hand and gingerly dabbed at the wound.

“Did you come in through the pool?”

The thought did occur that this could be a test. Another part of the prank. Something set up by the building or the sick fucking things who ran this little mind game. I didn’t like the barrage of questions or the rushed way in which he asked. I didn’t like anything about him. I think he sensed it.

“I’m sorry, we have to trust each other, son.”

“Why?”

“Because it’s us against them.”

“Who?”

“The thing you saw in the pool.”

I found it hard to argue with that point. I let my guard down after a while. I showed him the conference room. I told him about the jackets and the women crying and the windows to nowhere. He told me about the Station.

“Capital S if you want to write it down.”

According to Jamie, the Station is a long tunnel with a number of different chutes lined up along both sides. Think of it like Grand Central with dumbwaiters instead of trains. Each terminal can take you to a different place. Some of them lead to different parts of the Office. Some of them lead home. Some of them lead Down. 

“Picking is a gamble. There’s nothing to distinguish the chutes. They’re all identical. You just have to jump into the one that looks like home and hope for the best. That’s it.”

Jamie has made it to the Station on three separate occasions. His most recent trip sent him here. 

“Right at the Goddamn beginning.” 

We spent the day trading stories. I didn’t have much to offer. Jamie did. He claimed to have been stuck in the office for almost two full weeks. He spoke about demons and entities and bugs and termites and predators. He opined often about another guy, a maintenance worker named Emanuele, and how they got separated upstairs. He hoped he was still okay.

“The tunnels in the Big Room,” he grunted. “Avoid those fucking tunnels.”

I nodded like that was something which made sense. I didn’t necessarily believe him. The entire day felt like a fucked up fever dream. I think it just felt good to talk to somebody else about it. 

“Where do you think we are?” I asked at one point. “What is this place?”

“Hell,” he answered without missing a beat. “But I’m still holding out hope for purgatory.”

“Hell wouldn’t have such a clean carpet.”

“The snacks aren’t bad either.”

We got the idea to try and build out some defenses for the upcoming night. The lock in my conference room would help, but might not be enough for the patrollers, according to Jamie. We needed something sturdier. I took my new friend to the back offices. We explored for a while until we found a particularly off the path private office which connected to a bathroom. 

“Double locks,” Jamie approved. “Better to have a fail safe.”

The lights dimmed at their usual time. We gathered chips and water bottles and hatched a plan in the glow of computer monitors. I wanted to find a way out right then. Jamie wanted to wait.

“You don’t want to travel at night,” he insisted with a hand on my shoulder. “They eat at night.”

We agreed to take shifts. I would take first lookout while Jamie slept in the bathroom behind a double lock. I brought over my makeshift bed from the other night while he got comfortable. Jamie looked exhausted. The circles under his eyes had circles. I think this must have been his first real shuteye in a while.

“Wake me when you need it,” he offered. “Don’t be a hero.”

The lights cut at ten. He fell asleep soon after. I stayed vigilant at the desk post. We kept the shades drawn. I didn’t risk looking outside. There was some movement. A chair fell over. The pipes vibrated with the rush of fresh water. But nothing else happened. 

I woke Jamie a few hours later. I let him know of the developments. He thanked me and told me to use the jackets as a pillow. I laughed and asked if he fluffed it for me. Then I went to bed. I don’t know for how long.

‘

I woke up to a ringing in my ears. The bathroom door was unlocked. The private office outside was silent. The ringing pulsated until it slowly faded away altogether. A bird call took its place. 

I got up and rubbed my eyes a bit. I still couldn’t see straight with old contacts. I pushed back the door. A shape was standing on the desk. I could tell right away that something wasn’t right. The shape was looking back at me. It didn’t move. We stayed that way in silence for a second. 

It was Jamie. And he wasn’t wearing any pants.

“Whoa. What are you doing man?”

He stared at me in the dark a little while longer. He was an old man with wrinkles and nakedness did not do him any favors. He got down from the table slowly. He put his clothes back on, one button at a time, and smiled. I backed away into the exit. 

“Relax,” he laughed. “Come over here little buddy.”

I turned at the handle and felt it stick. 

“What are you doing?” I repeated.

“Nothing.”

My heart stopped in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. 

“You can trust me,” he advanced. “Remember?”

“Okay,” I retreated. “Where are your clothes?”

“I didn’t want to get them dirty,” he answered. “Or wet.”

His eyes flecked with color.

“You’re not Jamie,” I offered. “Are you?”

The silence hung in the air like a bad smell. I kicked at the door. Jamie waited. I kicked harder. He looked hurt. Like actually offended. I actually thought maybe my paranoia got the best of me. 

“I told you,” he giggled. “They only eat at night.”

His jaw unhitched. The door unclicked.

I ran.

‘

I’m safe now. Still stuck, but safe. I won’t say where. I think it might be better that way. The computers could be bugged. The cameras could be recording. My plan is still to get to the Station. I don’t know if it’s real or if I’m dead or if anyone is even able to read my rant into this old ass workstation. 

But if you are - 


Please know that the executives at White Valley International are responsible for holding people here. I don’t know how many. There could be dozens of us. Hundreds. I don’t fucking know. This place is an enormous cavern with no easy way out. I am located at the Follaton City branch. I have a family in nearby Sillica. My dad’s last name is **********. Please let him know I’m okay.

The Executive floor is three levels up. I have to go through them to get home. There’s smoke in the hallway. Someone up there will not stop screaming. The voices are getting louder - angrier, more excited even. There’s a rhythm to it, almost like a chant, and I think something is happening. I think I’m running out of time. I have to try. I won’t survive another night.

If you don’t hear from me, well, by now you know why.

I’m sorry, Dad. I love you so much.

Goodbye.
