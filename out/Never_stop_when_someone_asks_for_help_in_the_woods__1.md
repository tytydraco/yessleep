I was never the type of guy who believed in the paranormal. I live in a small town in Oregon, surrounded by forests, and my life follows a simple routine—work, home, a beer in front of the TV. But something happened two months ago, and I still can’t explain it.

It started when I was driving home late at night. The road cut through a dense forest, and my truck’s headlights sliced through the fog. That’s when I saw something strange—a man standing by the roadside. He was tall, thin as a stick, dressed in ragged clothes. The weirdest part was that he was holding a sign that read: "HELP. MY BROTHER IS IN THE WOODS."

I don’t like getting involved, but this was unsettling. I slowed down and rolled down my window.

"Are you okay?" I asked.

His eyes were wide open, as if he was in shock.

"Please... help," he croaked. "He's in there... something took him..."

I didn’t know what to do. It was dark, and the radio had just mentioned the disappearance of several people in our area. I shouldn’t have stopped.

But I did.

I turned off the engine, grabbed my flashlight, and followed him into the woods. The air was thick, humid, and carried a strange smell—like rot. After a few minutes, we reached a small clearing where torn, dirty clothes were scattered around, covered in what looked like dried blood.

"Where’s your brother?" I asked.

The man looked at me and smiled. Too wide.

I realized I had made a mistake.

Then I heard a sound. It wasn’t a human voice—more like something trying to imitate one. From deep in the forest came a slow, distorted cry: "HELP ME... HELP ME..." It sounded like a recording played at the wrong speed.

I stepped back, but the "man" mirrored my movement as if he was copying me. That’s when I noticed his feet weren’t touching the ground.

I ran.

I sprinted through the woods, my flashlight bouncing in my hand, my heart pounding. Behind me, I heard something moving—not footsteps, more like leaves rustling, as if something was sliding through the trees. I burst onto the road, jumped into my truck, and turned the key. The engine roared to life on the second try, and I floored the gas pedal.

I didn’t look in the rearview mirror. I was afraid of what I might see.

When I got home, I locked every door and checked all the windows. I couldn’t sleep. Every sound seemed suspicious, every branch tapping against the window made me shudder.

The next day, I told my neighbor. An old man who had lived here all his life, he looked at me seriously.

"You saw it," he said quietly. "The one that mimics people."

"What?" I asked.

"That thing... it's not human. Sometimes it appears by the roadside, sometimes it cries for help in the woods. You must never stop. Ever."

After that incident, I avoided that road like the plague. But one night, weeks later, I woke up to a strange sound. It sounded like someone standing outside my house. "HELP ME... HELP ME..."

I approached the window, unsure if my mind was playing tricks on me. Under the streetlight stood a silhouette. The same one from the roadside. It was staring straight at me.

I closed my eyes for a second, and when I opened them, the figure was gone. Still, I could feel its presence lingering for long minutes.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat on the couch, gripping a kitchen knife. Every little sound made me jump. Eventually, dawn broke, and I felt a brief moment of relief.

But when I stepped outside, my heart nearly stopped. On the ground, right beneath my window, someone had carved large, clumsy letters into the dirt: "I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU."

A few nights later, I heard a sound at the door. This time, it wasn’t a voice. It was scratching. Persistent, insistent, like something trying to get in.

I reached for the shotgun I kept under my bed and slowly approached the door. The scratching stopped. I held my breath, listening.

Then something slammed against the door with immense force. Once. Twice. Three times. The wood began to crack. A scream tore from my throat as the door finally gave way, and something tall, thin, and inhumanly fast burst inside.

I fired. Once. Twice. Three times. Finally, on the fourth shot, something changed. Large, black holes opened in its skin, as if its body was collapsing inward. It let out a horrific, metallic shriek before disintegrating into something that resembled thick, black smoke.

I collapsed onto the floor, shaking. The creature was gone, but its stench still lingered in the air. I knew one thing—it wasn’t a final victory. I knew it would come back someday.
