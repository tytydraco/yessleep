Hey everyone, I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. So I’ve been talking to this guy for about seven months now, and our relationship has been quite the rollercoaster. We started out really well, but then he ghosted me out of nowhere. I was pretty hurt by that, but then he came back and apologized, saying that he got scared because of our different religious beliefs. He told me he didn’t know how to handle the situation and admitted that he wasn’t as serious about me as he had claimed to be at first. That was a tough pill to swallow, but I appreciated his honesty, and I thought maybe we could work things out.

However, it didn’t take long before he disappeared again. When he returned for the second time, he said that he had realized he did me wrong and kept insisting that I was his ideal partner. He seemed genuinely remorseful and expressed a desire to make things work between us. I wanted to believe him, so I gave it another shot. Things went well for a bit, but once again, they took a turn for the worse. This time, he said the reason it wasn’t working out was that he felt like I wasn’t giving him enough time and attention. I’ll admit, I’ve got a busy life, but I thought we were doing okay in that department. Still, I decided to make an effort to prioritize him more, hoping that it would make a difference.

And here’s where things get frustrating. Now that I’m giving him the attention he claimed he wanted, it feels like he’s doing exactly what he accused me of doing. He’s either too busy or doesn’t respond to my calls or texts in a timely manner. It’s like I’m putting in all this effort, only to be met with silence on his end. Whenever we do talk, he has a list of excuses for why he couldn’t get back to me, ranging from work commitments to personal issues. I understand that life gets hectic, but it’s hard not to feel like he’s just making excuses at this point. It’s been incredibly confusing because his actions don’t match up with his words. One moment he’s telling me how much he values me and wants us to work, and the next, it feels like I’m being sidelined.

I’m caught in this cycle of him leaving and returning, and I’m beginning to question whether I’m being strung along. Part of me wants to believe that he’s sincere and that we can overcome these obstacles together, but another part of me wonders if I’m just being naïve. I’ve tried discussing these feelings with him, hoping for some clarity, but his responses are always vague and non-committal. It’s like he’s keeping me in this emotional limbo, and I’m not sure how much longer I can handle it. I’ve invested a lot of emotional energy into this relationship, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth it. Am I being too patient, or am I expecting too much from him? Should I take his inconsistency as a red flag and move on, or is there still hope for us? I’m really torn here, and I’d appreciate any advice or similar experiences from those who’ve been in a similar situation. How do you know when it’s time to let go, especially when someone keeps coming back into your life, making promises that seem to lead nowhere?
