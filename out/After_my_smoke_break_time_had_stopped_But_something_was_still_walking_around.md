It was an ordinary Wednesday morning. Mid-winter, still well before Christmas, but the office was already deep in its usual off-season lull. Since our company’s busy period was in spring or early summer, by now only Christmas songs were playing, and our days mostly consisted of goofing off.

Then came 11:25 — my usual pre-lunch bathroom and smoke break.

I smoked quickly; it was cold outside, and no one wanted to stand around too long. I was the only one who ducked into the restroom, while the others headed back to their desks to watch stupid videos.

Nothing out of the ordinary happened — it was just another simple Wednesday.
Until I stepped out of the restroom.

The coworkers I'd just been smoking with were still standing in the hallway. Dressed in winter coats and hats, one of them was halfway through opening the door — frozen mid-motion, as if time itself had paused.

They were just standing there. All of them… frozen stiff.
At first, I thought they were joking. Maybe they’d seen some meme and were trying to prank me.
But as I walked closer, it all started to feel weirder. Four of them were standing in the doorway, completely still. None of them even twitched. Nothing.


"What the hell are you guys doing?" I asked with a half-laugh.


But no one answered. They just stood there, completely still.


"Guys? What are you doing?"


Still nothing.
I reached out and grabbed one of my coworkers by the shoulder, gave him a shake.
It felt like I was trying to move a mannequin.
That’s when I started to freak out a little. What the hell was wrong with them? Had something happened? Were they sick?

No matter who I spoke to in the hallway, no one reacted. Their faces were frozen, staring blankly ahead — like prisoners of the moment.

Panicked, I hurried into the main office. I had to tell someone — something was wrong with the others.
But as soon as I pushed open the door to the large open workspace, I froze again.
No one moved. No one spoke. Not a sound.

It felt like I was trapped inside a model room. No one in the office moved — everyone was frozen. They stayed in whatever position they were in when time stopped. The monitors were still on, everything kept working as normal… only my coworkers looked like mannequins.

I rushed into my boss’s office, hoping maybe he was different. But no — same deal.
He sat there, bored expression on his face, leaning on his desk — not a single muscle moved. He was completely frozen too.

That’s when I really started to panic. Only one logical choice remained: get out of here. As fast as possible.


I bolted toward the elevator, nearly knocking over one of the coworkers frozen at the entrance. I jabbed the call button over and over — nothing. It was like the button didn’t even exist. There was power — the screen was lit — but the elevator didn’t move.

Alright, plan B: the stairs.

I ran to the stairwell, but the door wouldn’t open. I yanked on it like a lunatic — nothing.
Locked? Or was it broken just like the elevator?
What the hell is wrong with this place? And why am I the only one still moving?

Next idea: the window.
Even if I couldn’t climb out — we were on the seventh floor — at least I could try to signal someone. Or... something.

I hurried between the rows of desks. My coworkers were still just sitting there — motionless.
Not a single part of them moved. Their frozen eyes stared blankly into nothing.

The window wouldn’t open either. I pulled and twisted the handle, but it didn’t budge. It felt like someone had sealed it shut.

I stood there, clutching my head in frustration. The office had never been this quiet, this calm — and that only made it more disturbing. I was terrified, and I didn’t understand a single thing about what was happening.

Outside, the snow had started to fall.


I slumped down into my chair at my desk, hopelessly.
I tried all the company phones — nothing but silence. Even my own mobile showed no signal at all.
What the hell happened? I just went out for a smoke and a quick bathroom break, and now it seems like time itself has stopped. And me… why didn’t I freeze like the others? And more importantly: how the hell am I going to get out of here?

That’s when I heard a loud thud from the far back of the office, somewhere behind me.
I jumped up instantly — both excited and terrified. Was someone else here after all? Or maybe the others were starting to wake up?

But no. There was no one there.
Everything and everyone was still exactly where I left them — some sitting at their desks, others frozen mid-action by the printer.
Outside, the snow was still falling, and since the clock had slipped to 4 PM, darkness was slowly beginning to creep in.

I should be heading home soon. But I highly doubt I’m going anywhere today. I just hope help is on the way. Surely, someone will notice when an entire floor of people doesn't show up.

That’s when I noticed — still standing next to my desk — that one workstation was empty.
But the monitor was still on. If I remember right, that’s where Sandra sits. A kind, middle-aged woman. She always brings muffins at Christmas. We had coffee together just this morning. And now — she was gone.

Could that thud have been her?

Cautiously, I hurried over to her desk. It was just a few rows down. No sign of Sandra.
Her chair was knocked over, and her cat-themed coffee mug lay on the floor — the last bit of her drink spilled out across the tiles.


“Sandra?” I called out, loudly, hoping she was still nearby. “Where are you, Sandra?”


But no reply came. Just the same graveyard silence as before.
The hum of the machines was the only sound — until the fluorescent lights suddenly began to flicker.
And then it happened — the thing I’d feared most. All the lights went out.
Outside, it was nearly pitch black. Massive snowflakes drifted down slowly, almost majestically.
Inside, the office was plunged into near darkness.
The overhead lights were dead, but the monitors still glowed, casting a grotesque, cold light across the quiet room. My coworkers’ frozen bodies looked even more disturbing now, faintly illuminated in that ghostly glow.
It would’ve been better if they were at least working. Or talking. Or if I could hear them breathing. But there was nothing.

Then I heard it — The door to the supply closet at the back of the office creaked open.
Every part of me wanted to run. But… where?

I crept back to my desk.
Of course, I immediately banged my shin on the corner of a table and knocked over a small trash bin in the dark. But at least there… I felt a little more comfortable.
It was my desk. My spot. 
I stared at the supply closet door. There was only darkness beyond it. No movement. No sound since it had opened.

Maybe it just stayed ajar. Maybe a draft pushed it open.
But the windows didn’t open either… So what did?

And then I saw it— The horror. 


I just stood there, frozen —Like the others around me. But I… I was still conscious. Still very much awake.

In the corridor between the desks, a strange figure was shuffling toward me. 
It looked like a dried-out corpse: its skin was pure white, clinging tightly to its bones. Its face was sunken, eye sockets dark and hollow. It had no mouth at all.

But its bony arms were so long they reached the floor, ending in huge, knobby fingers.
From its hunched chest, smaller skeletal hands dangled forward – reaching, twitching –
and these tiny hands moved as if they were playing invisible piano keys in the air, or searching for something unseen.

I couldn’t move a muscle. I didn’t scream. I didn’t throw anything. I didn’t even try to hide.

I just stood there in my stupid shirt, staring as the monitors’ glow lit up the grotesque figure, inching ever closer to my desk.

It was almost upon me when, with a sudden instinct, I ducked down and crawled under the desk. I don’t know what drove me. I don’t know why I thought it was a good hiding spot —
but at the time, it felt like the only one I had.

My coworkers’ frozen bodies still sat in place at their desks. It was all absurd — at least, as much as I could make out in the dim light.


Then, in the blink of an eye…the creature was right there. Standing at my desk.

I saw its massive, bony feet — the nails were like knives. Its body was tall and gaunt — so skeletal, it seemed to stretch all the way to the ceiling.

I crouched under my desk, holding my breath.
Damn cables dangled around my neck, and between my bag and the chair, I barely had space to fit.
But the creature didn’t notice me. It just stood there… waiting. 
Maybe for me. Maybe for something else.

Then it moved.
Its enormous hand rested on the head of the man who sat behind me — Pete.
Pete was the guy in the desk right behind mine. A brown-nosing little machine — no one really liked him. But even so… I didn’t want to see what that thing was about to do to him.
I trembled as I waited to see what would happen.

The monster simply squeezed Pete’s frozen head…then tipped him out of his chair.
Pete lay on the floor — staring at me.

I didn’t make a sound.

The creature reached down, feeling for Pete’s body. With its long, skeletal fingers, it grabbed hold of his face — and dragged him away.

It turned and headed back the way it had come, shuffling slowly, just as before — pulling Pete’s paralyzed body behind it.

Only one thought flashed through my mind:
I have to get out of here.


I sat trembling beneath my desk, listening as the grotesque creature shuffled across the office carpet.

What the hell was I supposed to do now? There was no way out — none of the exits would open.
From under my desk, I could see clearly in the nighttime gloom: outside, snow was falling in heavy sheets.
Had time stopped out there too? Or was life continuing as usual?

Cautiously, I crept out from under the desk — just enough to look around.

The creature was now shuffling near the opposite end of the office, far from the supply closet. Pete was no longer being dragged behind it — I had no idea where he’d been left, or what had become of him.

The thing just wandered slowly, and the tiny skeletal hands hanging from its chest were twitching, pawing at the air, as if searching for something.

I couldn’t stay in the same room with it. It was only a matter of time before it found me.

I had one chance left: sneak into the lobby again —try the elevator or the stairwell door one more time.


The creature was still at the far end of the office. I crawled slowly on all fours, inching my way toward the door.
I made it surprisingly far, right to where my smoking buddies had been frozen.

One of them still held the office door open — so I slipped through easily. The lobby was dark too. The elevator wasn’t even lit.
I rushed to it and jabbed the buttons —nothing. None of them worked.

Then I turned toward the stairwell door — and out of the corner of my eye… I saw it.

The creature was there. Standing in the doorway — at the office entrance, looking out.
It was staring at me with those sunken, empty eyes.
It knew I was there. It wasn’t shuffling anymore. It ran. Straight at me.

I yanked the door handle, but it wouldn’t budge. It was locked. This is where I’m going to die.

But then… as the creature’s thundering footsteps shook the floor of the lobby,
I saw it: the light was on in the restroom.

With one desperate leap, I sprinted over, jumped inside, and slammed the door shut behind me. I darted into one of the stalls and locked it tight. The monster smashed through the restroom’s main door.
I was gasping for breath, crouching in the stall, trying to stay as silent as I could — but the thing knew exactly where I was.
It started pounding on the stall door. Its massive hands slammed against the metal,
making the entire room tremble. The door bent inward — it looked like it could burst open at any second.

There was nothing else I could do.
I screamed. Screamed from pure fear.
And then… a familiar voice spoke.


“Matt? Matt, are you okay in there?”


At first, I didn’t even notice. 
The creature’s pounding had stopped. The stall door no longer shook. There was silence.
Calm. Familiar. Just like the restroom always used to be.

And then someone spoke again from just outside the stall where I was hiding.


“Matt? Is that you in there? What the hell are you doing?”


I was terrified.
My shirt was soaked with sweat, I was shaking like a leaf. With trembling hands, I opened the stall door. It creaked slowly outward — and standing there was a familiar face.
Dave.
My friend. The guy I always went out for a smoke with. The same guy who, just a moment ago, had been frozen in place by the hallway door. Now he was standing there, staring at me with suspicion, holding a coffee mug.

I was crouched on the toilet seat, drenched in sweat, pale as a corpse, and shaking uncontrollably.

Slowly, without saying a word, I climbed down. I stumbled out of the stall, staggering toward the door. Dave didn’t say anything — he just looked at me like I’d lost my mind.

I staggered back into the office. 
Everyone was back in place. Some were working. Others just chilling. The clock said 4:30 — half an hour left until the end of the day.

Dizzy and disoriented, I started looking for the ones the creature had taken.

The chair behind my desk was empty. Pete’s stuff was gone. No picture of his dog. No stupid motivational calendar.

Dave and a few others stood behind me, staring, confused. What the hell is wrong with me? Suddenly, I spun around like a madman and whispered:


“Where’s Pete?”


No one answered.
They just looked at each other, puzzled — as if they didn’t even know who I meant.


“Dave,” I said, stepping closer. “Dave… where’s Sandra? Muffin Sandra. You know who I mean.”


Dave just shook his head.


“Matt… there’s no one named Sandra who works here.”


I looked around, panic rising in my chest.
What the hell is going on? 

And then one single thought filled my mind.

I need to get the fuck out of this place.
