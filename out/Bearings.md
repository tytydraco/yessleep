A ball bearing follows me. A single ball bearing, a small metallic sphere. Everywhere I go, I spot the ball bearing. The first few times I dismissed the sightings as a mere coincidence. Then I began justifying the sightings with pitifully innocent reasons. “Maybe a surge in ball bearings manufacture, maybe humans have collectively decided they dislike friction”. But that would explain some consecutive sightings. Maybe sightings for a week. Two weeks. A month at best. The ball bearing has followed me perpetually for two years now.



I don’t remember the first time I saw the ball bearing, it must have been inconsequential. It disliked rolling. It never rolls into my sight. I look at a place and it is just there, sitting on a patch of level surface. Rolling would make it appear less menacing I think. Do level surfaces exist everywhere? They are the ball bearing’s home. After I have spotted the ball bearing, I can do whatever I want with it. I may take it and roll it away. I may drop it and see it bounce with sharp, sonorous “pop” sounds. I can throw it very far away. And it goes away. Then I can finally sit peacefully at that location, a restaurant, a bar. I can work on my laptop peacefully. I can look around assured that the ball bearing won’t be staring back at me. My eyeballs feel light and free. 



Soon I would leave the location. And the ball bearing would stay hidden for a while longer, lulling me into a sense of false safety. “It is gone perhaps”, I would think. I would sit on the bus and head back home. I would take a nap. And I would wake up, my sight blurred for a few moments. In these brief moments of solace, I did not remember the ball bearing existed. But as my eyes refocused, I would see the ball bearing glistening on a level surface. Every single time. It would just be sitting on a level surface. Its garb of innocence was shamefully obvious.



It exists for other people too. They can also spot it. Kids would pick it up and roll it about, or throw it away even. Teens loved to kick it. Middle aged men enjoyed staring it at blankly. Sometimes, the inertia of the bus itself would make it roll away from my sight. But the kids, the teens, the men were all at peace. They were not haunted by the ball bearing. The ball bearing had not come for them. It came for me. 



Telling friends and family was not too helpful. Even when they could hear the dread in my voice, they would say “it is just a ball bearing, how is it scary?” Scary? It was absolutely dreadful. I had once tried to blindfold myself for an entire day. I did not see the ball bearing, but it made its presence felt. I would reach for something I kept on my table and my fingertips would touch the cold metallic round skin of the ball bearing. It would sometimes fall from nowhere onto the floor, close enough that my ears would shiver at the crescendo of popping sounds as it bounced towards me. The ball bearing is a bastard.



However, I would be lying if I said it was menacing at all times. Sometimes I would find it sitting  woefully on a level surface. And I would attempt to transfer it onto another level surface. Perhaps a surface better suited for a ball bearing of such stature. Perhaps I desperately wanted to befriend it. “This is what the Buddha would do”, I would tell myself. An act of kindness towards the perpetrator. In return, the ball bearing would tell me that I was stupid. The surface I thought was level had a subtle slope. The ball bearing would begin rolling mockingly. I thought the ball bearing was telling me “if this surface was level, I would materialize on it you moron”. The ball bearing was ungrateful. But I soon realized that it was the ball bearing’s idea of banter. The ball bearing had an ironically pointy sense of humor. Nevertheless, I was alarmed by the lack of level surfaces around me, along with the sheer abundance of surfaces that were slightly sloped and appeared level to humans.



One night after consuming too much caffeine, I had a chilling epiphany. Despite the heatwave, I felt cold drops of sweat crystallising on my brow. I realized that everytime the ball bearing revealed itself to me, I was always surprised. As if it had woken me up from a good dream. I realized that the ball bearing only showed itself to me when I had forgotten about its existence. “I mustn’t forget”, I told myself. If I remembered the ball bearing, I would not have to see it physically. That would solve all my problems. I saw a distant ray of hope, hope of me having a normal life again.



I did not see the ball bearing for many weeks following the night. I had put up small pictures of metallic spheres around my house, so it never escaped my memories. It was working fine until something happened. Something quite interesting. I wanted to see the ball bearing. I wanted to destroy it I think. I knew melting it never worked, maybe I could use a hydraulic press? Maybe I just wanted to pick it up and roll it. Maybe even lick it. I had never licked the ball bearing. After the amount of time we had spent together, that felt like a shame. Or maybe I just wanted to say my goodbyes. It had been by my side for quite long after all. I wanted to see it one last time. But how do I meet the ball bearing again? How do I forget the ball bearing? I ripped the pictures of those metallic spheres from the walls.



One’s reflection on the flat mirrors is a construct. If the first person who saw their reflection saw it on a spherical surface, we would perhaps be combing our hairs on hemispherical mirrors protruding from our walls. While we would still see each other standing upright, our sense of self would be spherical. It would be quite perfect. I wanted to see my reflection on the silken smooth skin of my ball bearing. I longed to meet it again. It would tell me how I was really supposed to look. If I met it again I would never let it go. I would just keep it with me. I would keep it so close. But I could not stop thinking about my ball bearing.



I cannot get my beautiful ball bearing out of my head. I have, on more than one occasion, touched myself to the thought of it. We take roundness for granted. It can be so peerless, so elegant and so intimidating at the same time. I like to imagine my ball bearing on my lap while I listen to jazz. I would touch it if I felt lonely and it would be warm. I would touch it if I felt lonely and it would be cold.

Some days I would hurt in the mornings because I could not hold my ball bearing close to me. I wished I could feel the metallic softness of my ball bearing as it rolled on my naked body. I would wax myself so body-hair did not stop its march. I would love to feel it against my groin. My beautiful ball bearing was much too far from me.



As I spent more time holding the memories of my ball bearing close, I understood it was never menacing in the first place. It just wanted to be loved. It just wanted to be seen. It just wanted to be touched. The thought of the ball bearing showing itself to someone else now would often keep me up at nights. I had bought many ball bearings, all the flat surfaces of my house were filled with round metallic pellets. But none of them, not a single one of them was my ball bearing. They rolled differently. They did not go away and return again. They were lifeless. They were a pitiful mimicry at best. 

Maybe I did not deserve my ball bearing. I had not done much in life anyways. I had not loved it when it mattered, what good would crying do now. The ball bearing must be with someone who loves it so much more than I was capable of. I should perhaps make do with these imitations, and keep my ball bearing alive in memory.



My beautiful ball bearing met me in a dream last night. I wish I slept a little longer.
