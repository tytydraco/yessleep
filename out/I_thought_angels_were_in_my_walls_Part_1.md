I was never really religious. I was raised catholic, same as my mother, and her mother; grew up going to church, singing in the back row of the school choir, but it never really sunk in for me. The only time I understood the fear my mother felt was leafing through her yellowing children’s bibles. The idea of those angels, with so many rolling eyes and golden bodies, being able to see me. My brother would make fun of me for it, but I hid under the covers every time I read them so those colourful paper angels wouldn’t see me look at them in fear. 

I stopped attending church when I moved away to university.

When this all began, I believed my dingy apartment was infested with rats. The place was cheap, and already had a serious mold problem.  I began to wake up in the night to scratching in the walls. I called my landlord, who called exterminators, who came in and went with no help. Nothing was ever caught in the traps I put out, and for a while I thought maybe I had some sort of overworked student psychosis until my friend Rebbekah suggested we move to the library study rooms. 

As someone who couldn’t afford another place so close to campus, I began to just try to live with it, as any other student would. It was after I came home from my home town, after the anniversary of my brother Daniel’s death, that it switched from rats to angels. I don’t know why I thought it, most likely a mixture of grief and sleep deprivation, but once the thought entered my head it never really left. In the moment it made sense. It was simply my own actions catching up to me, and they were preparing for my judgement. 

Maybe that little thought in the back of my head was why I let Brandon stay on my couch. Brandon, who had fought with his girlfriend. My tall, rat-like, coworker who always spoke too loudly and far too long. And maybe a part of me felt guilty for wishing his girlfriend would leave him already, even if I didn’t say it. Maybe it was because he reminded me of my brother. Maybe I thought it would make me a good person. Whatever it was, now Brandon was lying on my thrifted, once strawberry red, couch with my $15 dollar mink blanket. 

“Well, goodnight. Just wake me up if you like get cold or need something. The rats can be a bit noisy but- They don’t really do anything.” I stood like a stranger at a party in my own living room. 

“Alright. Glad I won’t wake up with some rat running over my toes then.” Brandon tossed the blanket over him. “Can you turn the lights off on the way out? I dunno where the switch is.” He was scrolling through his phone as he spoke. 

“Sure. Night.” Flicking the lights out, I left the room. 

Lying in bed, I listened to the rats scurrying through the wall. They seemed a bit livelier than usual. Perhaps they knew someone else was in the house. But if I really was being judged, it could wait until morning.

The sun awoke me. It gently shone through the thin curtains against my eyelids. I lay there a while, basking in the quiet, soft awakening. Part of me hoped that Brandon had made up with his girlfriend in the night so I could enjoy my peaceful morning. 

Eventually, the assignments in the back of my head drove me out of bed. Quietly I shuffled up, and down the hall to the lounge. I pressed the handle softly, toeing open the door to avoid potentially waking Brandon. 

Peeking in, the room was dimly lit. The sunlight was shining through the curtains, leaving the room in a warm haze. The couch was empty. Stepping in, I quickly glanced around. Perhaps he had gone to the bathroom, or to raid my kitchen. I picked up the mink blanket that lay in a heap next to the couch, quickly folding it into squares. Propping the blanket onto the back of the couch, I saw it. Some dark puddle was pooled on the couch cushions. It was dry, already having stained into the fabric, and a rich colour. 

“Brandon?” The name echoed dully through the room. “Brandon? Are you okay?” Not even the rats made a sound. My chest became tight as I tried to calmly search the apartment. The bathroom door was open and empty. *Maybe he really did make up with his girlfriend in the middle of the night.* The front door was still locked, as I left it. 

“Brandon?” The kitchen was clean, just the same dishes drying from last night’s dinner. My shoulders cradled my jaw as I wandered back to the lounge. He was just gone. As if he had vanished into another world. The dried blood stared back at me. My breath was coming shorter and shorter. I could see my eyes wide and glossy in the black reflection of his cellphone sitting on the floor. What could have happened? Surely, rats couldn’t have done this. That was absurd. The front door was still locked, all the windows closed, and I had slept like a baby all night, and Brandon was just gone. The glowy haze felt suffocating. I stared into that bright light streaming through the windows, as if that inky black spot would just vanish like he had if I tried hard enough. My eyes slowly drifted up with the sunlight. I could only think in colourful fading pages. 



I don’t know how long I stayed stuck there. My limbs were heavy. Black spots flickered through my vision, swimming through the golden light. Black spots, black spots. Brandon did not appear from any corner of the room as I waited. The haze lifted eventually. My body ached as I stumbled through the dark room. Quietly I changed clothes, brushed my hair, packed my bag, and left the apartment. I locked the door on that dark spot in my living room. 

I was an hour early for my lecture. The wind was cold so I waited in the hallway for the current lecture to finish. Occasionally some harried student or self important tutor would wander by, but they paid no mind to me. I stayed huddled from the cool draft against the wall, cupping my hands in front of my flushed face like some victim. Where I sat, the oil heater dug into my back but I didn’t feel the need to move. It was too much effort to move my leaden limbs anyway. 

Thankfully, the lecture room cleared soon enough. Students flooded out in streams, a wave of chatter and bodies. Managing to stand, I was shuffled against the wall further as wired young adults and scruffy book bags brushed against my arms. As they dissipated off to their flats and study rooms I finally moved through to the theatre. My class wasn't for another half hour, but the room didn’t have a draft like the hall did. The quiet was disconcerting after the morning. I kept expecting to hear the scuffle of rats that I had grown used to. If they were even rats at all. *Don’t think about it.* But the sparse silence of the theatre didn’t leave much for me to think about instead. I glanced around at the posters littering the walls. *Looking for participants! Study in anxiety amongst young adults.* A diagram of the muscle structure. *How grief effects you.* A poster for a guest lecture on head trauma. *Free lunch for all students. Meeting at First Church on Knox Street.* The desk suddenly became much more interesting. The grain flowed right. A knot near the top edge to my left. Three chips on the edge, two next to each other, one on the other side of my body. A darker patch in a blob-like st- 

“Marnie!” I jumped back. Rebbekah appeared at my side. “Ah! Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. Real focused on that table huh?” I glanced back down at the table. I could no longer find the stain. 

“Uh, sorry just” Shaky breath out. “Lost in a daydream I guess.”

“Okay.” Rebbekah flopped into the seat next to me, immediately spreading her stationary all across the table. “Man, I totally did not watch the last, like, four lectures so who even knows what this is about.” 

I couldn’t tell her if I wanted to. Rebbekah didn’t seem like she wanted to find out anyway as she immediately launched into a lengthy story about a man she had met at a party over the weekend. I stayed silent, watching her speak. 

Her curly maroon hair bounced every which way as she spoke, exaggerating every word. Her hands swung wildly, painting an abstract picture of this mystery man. The faded cord bracelet Daniel had given her bobbed on her wrist. Every time she spoke, she became completely lost in her own words. It was one of the reasons I just listened. The other was that I couldn’t stop her even if I tried. 

Even as class began, the lecturer’s words seemed to only be a breaker between her story. Soon I too found myself pulled into the world revolving around this claiming to be 6’4 man and his escapades amongst the very cramped house party. 

As she spoke and spoke, the events of this morning became more and more like a dream. He probably did leave in the night. Probably left his phone in the rush. The room was dark and it was early. 

As we walked out of the stuffy lecture theatre, It felt like nothing had ever happened. Rebbekah pealed off towards the library and the rest of the walk home was spent quietly. 

Arriving at the door is what snapped me back into the horrors of the morning. I hesitated to unlock it. Maybe if I never go in, it never really happened. My fingers began to hurt as the keys cut into the cold flesh. The keys seemed to jingle so loudly as I swung open the door. *Nothing happened. Brandon left last night. Just go inside.* I stepped in quickly and shut the door behind me. Walking briskly through the house, I went about putting away my coat, dropping my bag onto the bed, and taking off my shoes. *Shower, shower sounds good. Warm up.* I grabbed a towel from the edge of the basket and wandered through to the bathroom. My eyes skimmed past the yawning entrance to the living room. 

The shower was just what I needed for both my nerves and chilled skin. Warm steam seemed to flow right through my throat and lungs, soothing and gentle. Soaking in the heat, I began to feel the goosebumps fading and my fingers gently ached. The sound of the water pattering against the shower floor was a comforting background noise. *Wait*. Beyond the white noise of the water was a sound. Scratching. *Just rats.* Relieved, I went back to scrubbing through my hair, foamy trails slithering down my face and forcing me to close my eyes. I tried to ignore the scratching, to pretend it was just another layer of splashing water. My hair fell in a thick sheet as I rinsed it under the stream.

“C-n yu trn mmm” Whatever noise it was murmured under the water. I quickly opened the shower door. Goosebumps rose over my arms. The water splashed loudly on the plastic floor and the walls scratched and creaked, but I couldn’t hear any intruder walking through the hallway. 

“Can you turn off the lights-“ Brandon’s voice was right outside the door, sounding like the very night he vanished. I nearly smashed into the floor stumbling up out of the shower. Swinging open the door, towel clutched around my body, I was faced with an empty hall. 

“Brandon? Brandon, where have you been?”  My breath was catching amidst whatever was stirring in my chest. 

“Brandon?”

“Can you-“ His voice had moved towards the living room. Swinging open that door led to yet another empty room. The blanket still lay folded on the couch from this morning. Brandon’s phone, lit up with notifications, still lay unmoved on the floor. The only signs of life were my own wet footprints leading into the room. 

“Brandon? Did you go somewhere last night? I was worried- There’s blood on the couch.” The room remained cold. There was no one here. 

“Can you turn the lights off on the way out?” It was as if Brandon was standing right behind me. I yelped, stumbling forward. Whipping around, only the empty hall was behind me. The rats scratched more fervently. 

Oh God, there was no one there. 

I raced out the room, slamming into my bedroom and flinging shut the door. 

I scrambled into the corner, heart pounding through my ears and eyes. Something continued to blabber outside in Brandon’s voice. *Oh Mary, full of grace.*  I found myself praying out of sheer instinct, years of following my mother’s church shoes. *God please, is this some kind of punishment? Please, I’ve tried to be good. I didn’t mean it.* 

“Gl-d I wnt wk p” Whatever it was was suddenly outside my door in the hall. 

“Please stop! I don’t know what you want!” I managed to whine out a plea through my fervent prayer. The angels in the walls scratched harder and harder, as if trying to break out and drag me away. My eyes were watering now, and every fiber of my body stood on end as if it had its own electrical current. *Hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary.* 



For a long time I stayed crouched in that corner; long after whatever was taunting me stopped speaking. By the time I moved, only my hair was still wet. The angels continued to scratch in the walls, and I felt them watch me in my closed off room for the rest of the afternoon. 

I went to work that evening in a daze. I sleepwalked into the gas station. The fluorescent lights shone as cold as the AC, which was far too cold for the brisk fall air outside. Despite the overstimulating reflective surfaces and goosebumps crawling up my arms, it was better than being at the flat. 

Alone at the counter stood my coworker, looking more than ready for the shift change over. 

“Hey. How’s it going?” She was leaning on the counter amongst the candy bars and stacks of takeaway cups. My feet carried me towards the staff room. 

“Good. How was your shift?” It was more of a mumble that came out of my mouth than anything. Still, she followed me with her eyes before following me to the back. 

“Uh fine. Quiet for a Tuesday. I mean, I wouldn’t know. I was just covering since Brandon didn’t show; I don’t normally work today.” She shrugged on an obnoxiously red raincoat. My tongue seemed stuck to the roof of my mouth. 

“I mean he’s probably just pulling a sickie like usual.” She glanced at me. “Are you okay? You look kinda pale. Please don’t say you’re sick too.” I felt sick. 

“I’m alright. Just didn’t sleep well.” It didn’t seem like she cared past that. 

“Okay then, see you. Try not to fall asleep.” And with that she walked out of the store. Mechanically, I put down my bag and wandered to the counter. 

The rest of the shift seemed to disappear before my eyes in a vortex of thoughts. Over and over the events of the day flickered through my mind with an unending list of questions. 

*Why are they watching me? Why now? I never meant for anyone to get hurt.* Over and over and over. *Why did Brandon have to suffer because of me? Are they watching me right now? I’m a bad person. I did this. I deserve this.* 

Customers occasionally shuffled in and out of the store. Not a single face comes to mind thinking back. 

*Dear God, I’m sorry. I’ll try harder. I’ll be better. Just tell me what to do to make up for it.* 

As the sun set, the fluorescent lights glow made it seem as if the day would never end. Anxiety crawled through every muscle like every test I’ve ever taken. But I didn’t know when this one would end. If it ever would. 

I managed to fight my way out of my head enough to close the store. Sitting in my car, waiting for the warmth of the heater, I was frozen. I didn’t want to go home. Home was where they were waiting; awaiting my judgement. Behind that door there was still a black stain in my faded red couch. 

A loud, obnoxious, default ringtone was blaring from my pocket. Digging it out I was met with a smiling picture of Mum. 

“Hello?” 

“Hi sweetie! I was trying to call you!”

“Oh. I was at work.”

“All day? Joking! I know you’re so busy with your study and friends!” I only have one friend, and she wasn’t even mine to begin with. My Mum thinks more highly of me and I am not inclined to burst her bubble. “I just wanted to call and see how you were holding up? I hadn’t heard from you for a while.”

“I’m fine, Mum. Just been busy.”

“How was your exam? That um… lab one.” It was Anatomy 304. 

“Ah, it went alright. Didn’t do as well as I wanted to.” Or as well as I needed to pass that class. 

“Well you tried and that’s what matters. I’m proud of you for even getting in!” I did try, and I did fail, and it’s a community college with a 90% acceptance rate. The words still stung at my eyes. Her standards have lowered since Daniel. 

“Thanks. I might have to go. I’m just in my car right now.”

“Okay. Well I’ll call you later in the week. I love you.”

“Love you too. Bye.”

“Bye, sweetie.” The silence in the car felt heavier. My Mum couldn’t know what I had done, what I had caused. My phone clicked onto silence. I turned on my headlights, hoping to anything but angels that they would lead me away.

I unlocked my front door with trembling hands. I had already heard the skittering before I pulled out my key. Coat away, bag unpacked, shoes off; I gathered my courage. I made a plan in my head.

“Hello.” It came out a whisper. I didn’t know what else to say to them. They didn’t respond other than some slight scratching. I moved shyly into the kitchen, afraid to breathe. Pulling out cereal, I poured it into several bowls. *What am I even doing.* Taking the bowls I placed them around my flat. One next to the TV cabinet, one next to the toilet, a bowl in the entry way and on top of my closet as close to the hole in the ceiling as possible, and lastly one next to the couch. 

I don’t know what I expected; maybe to feed them, appease them. My mum did always say to offer guests something to eat. I found myself lighting candles in the living room and digging out the dusty bibles my Mum gave me when I moved out. Not quite having figured out what I was doing, I just stacked them on my coffee table. When I stepped back, my home looked like a strange funeral. 

“If you need something… Just say. I’ll try to be an okay host.” My voice faded out at the end, feeling silly talking to the walls. Heat flushed my cheeks for a moment but that icy black spot only a foot away drove me back to the reality of it all. I crept back to my room, once again an intruder in my own home. 



For the first time since I left home, I prayed before bed. I had never once prayed for friends or good scores, though maybe I needed to, but right now, I prayed for forgiveness. I somehow fell asleep after praying that I would wake up a better person. 

I woke up feeling unrested. My sheets had wrapped around me in the night and my joints ached from the battle. I fought my way out of bed as the cooling sheen of sweat left me uncomfortable. 

The angels shuffled quietly through the walls as I walked through to the kitchen. The room was hazy and golden, like every other morning, but the chill still crawled over my skin. Over breakfast I tried to research what was happening to me. *Angels seen IRL. Do angels exist? How to live a virtuous life. Am I going to Hell?* Most of the videos were obviously fake, glaringly full of bad photoshop and worse acting. A few promising leads led me to fanatic christian blogs but all their claims of angels and miracles were only anecdotal at best. It seemed that this was my burden to bear. 

With my head clouded in articles and the burning loneliness of my situation I headed out into the brisk morning to try and grapple with it all. The cold air numbing my face was a perfect distraction for my muddy head. Something about the physical sensation of the cold just helped pull me back to the here and now. I don’t know where I planned to go, but I just kept walking further and further from the crowded apartment. 

I must have done it unconsciously, but I arrived at the steps of a small local church. Just a tiny building, a metal cross over the doorway and rough off white concrete with chipping paint, and sparse trees littered in thin gardens around it. A few lone cars sat in the carpark, windows foggy, but I couldn’t see anyone inside. I hesitated on the stairs. Who better to discuss this with than a priest, but it had been a long time since I had stepped foot in a church. This wasn’t a place I belonged anymore. Yet neither was my own apartment. Or my childhood home seven towns over. *Do I belong anywhere anymore? Do I deserve to belong to anyone anymore?* Before I lost my courage I pushed through the heavy door. 

The church was wide and empty, despite its small size. The only person I could see was an elderly priest standing at a side table. He was pushing through a bible with the gnarled fingers of one hand and making notes to a sermon with the other. He didn’t look up as I entered, but I felt him acknowledge me anyway. Somewhere deeper in the church I could hear someone, *or something*, moving around. It was so quiet I felt as if my breathing was disturbing the peace. I shuffled in and let the door swing shut behind me. For a moment I just stood there in the doorway, unsure what to do. A small confessional booth caught my eye. As if afraid of being caught, I softly walked over to it and slipped inside. 

The hard wood was uncomfortable but it was comforting to be hidden away from it all; a facade of protection behind the carved walls. The wood on the other side of the divider creaked as someone sat down next to me. We sat there quietly, just breathing. I brushed down my dark blue coat as if I had to appear presentable. Or maybe it was just in a way of delaying the conversation; of building my confidence. 

“Forgive me father for I have sinned.” My voice was hushed, afraid of breaking the awkward serenity of the church. “I’m sorry, I don’t remember how this is meant to go.”

“That’s quite alright. Just tell me what’s haunting you.” His voice was raspy, possibly a smoker’s, but had a strong, almost posh, undertone. 

“I think I’m being judged.” My breath shook as I forced out my confession. He hummed quietly in contemplation. 

“We are all being judged. Do you think you deserve it?”

“Yes.”

“Why is that? You are here to be forgiven are you not? To be forgiven you must first be judged.”

“I think…” I paused and let his words hang over me. “I don’t know if I can be forgiven. I think it’s in my nature.”

“We can all be forgiven, my child. Otherwise there would not be a single angel in Heaven.”

“Then why are they watching me? I prayed for forgiveness.”

“Who is watching you?” He coughed slightly next to me. It may as well have been a gunshot. 

“I don’t know. Angels, I think. Maybe God through them.”

“There is a comfort in having them watch over you, even if they may be the eyes of judgement. Just let them guide you; they will tell you if you are on the right path.” I couldn’t force out how I had already been punished. 

“Thank you, Father.” I could feel my eyes start to well. “Am- Am I forgiven?” He shuffled a little. His voice was closer to the divider when he spoke. I could see his silhouette through the carved wood.

“Of course, my child. Be at peace.” I rose unsteadily, and fled the church before a tear could fall. 

The cold wind outside made my eyes water anyway as I made my way home again. In my chest, I knew my forgiveness wouldn’t change anything, I was being judged for everything to come just as much as my past sins, but it made me feel lighter. Just a bit.
