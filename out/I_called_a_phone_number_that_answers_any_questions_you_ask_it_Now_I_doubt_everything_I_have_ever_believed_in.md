Imagine, just for a second, that you were me:



You always thought of yourself as being a very special kind of person, someone truly meant for greatness. You believed money and fame were just around the corner, patiently waiting for you. You spent your twenties desperately searching for your life's quintessential purpose, convincing yourself that you would find it somewhere along the way. You dreamed of Oscars, Grammys, and championship belts, so you sweated, bled, and sacrificed, believing it would all pay off at some point. Your insignificant self trapped in a constant chase for meaning.



Despite all the pain and isolation, those periods of your life were often your happiest. You thrived in the pursuit, living off this fragile sense of direction. But sooner or later, things always seemingly fell apart. When the pages you had frantically written in the past suddenly seemed cringeworthy and uninteresting. When you felt that once-vicious fire inside you flickering again. When the comedic senselessness of your commitment overtook everything you once believed in. That’s when you knew it was time to move on again. This is who you are, continuously jumping from obsession to obsession, always searching for the thing that will finally make you feel whole. Music, literature, academics, sports—you tried it all, leaving it behind only to find your next big fling. Until you're suddenly in your thirties, having wasted the supposed potential that once made up your entire identity, with nothing to show for it.



Now, imagine you are walking down a busy street, on your way home from a job that really deserves no form of description, and you see an ominous flyer floating right into your hands.



**"Looking for answers? Call the number below!"**



Don’t tell me you wouldn’t have at least considered it.



Of course, I wasn’t stupid enough to actually expect some form of rainbow-colored unicorn to pick up the phone and tell me next week's winning lottery numbers. But what did I have to lose? My years of hopeless wandering left me with no real friends or partners. I spent my time in constant loneliness, either trying to achieve the momentary goal I set for myself or looking for the next big thing I could put my everything into. At worst, I would end up dialing the number of some sort of sex hotline and get an unreasonably expensive phone bill. At best, I would have finally found the solution to all my problems and insecurities. So I set up the call and nervously waited, secretly praying that some mystic entity would come and free me from my never-ending mediocrity and blinding nihilism.



Beep.



Beep.



Beep.



"The hell am I doing here?" I moaned, letting out a small sigh.



The time spent longingly staring at my screen slowly convinced me that I was acting like an immature teenager. Who in their right mind would pick up a flyer like that and actually try to call? Isn’t this paranormal bullshit just some laughable distraction for me?



With my finger already hovering over the end-call button, a robotic voice suddenly addressed me:



"Welcome! One question per customer. Processing your answer could potentially take some time. You may state your question in any living language recognized by the *Ethnologue: Languages of the World*.“



"What the fuck," I whispered, frantically trying to get my breath under control, picking up my trusty iPhone 8 that had fallen down the stairs in the process.



I was sure that this was just some sort of elaborate AI a reckless prankster set up. I knew I would probably feel like an absolute idiot in about five minutes. But what rational human being would decide to hang up now? Who wouldn’t at least try to get an answer?



"What am I really destined for? What is my life’s ultimate goal, and what do I have to do to achieve it?“



The response came almost instantly.



"We have received your question. We will now process it and get back to you soon. Thank you for your patience," the same monotonous voice as before replied. "Our customer service department will take care of you while waiting."



Customer service department? What the hell is this place? Did I unknowingly become a participant in some sort of sick game show? Was the CIA conducting an illegal mind-altering experiment? Or was this really some form of magical call center? I didn’t really have time to contemplate though, as my stream of thought was suddenly interrupted.



„Collin, are you there?“ 



„Ah shit.“



It seemed like my father got home early. 



„I’m here, baba,“ I shouted through the house. „Where are you?“



He would usually come to the living room right away, but despite the fact that his voice appeared suspiciously close, he was nowhere to be seen.



„You know where I am, silly. I am right here,“ he bemusedly responded.



„What do you mean right here, I am alone!“ I chuckled, while checking for potential hiding spots under the table and sofa. „Baba, this...this is such a lame prank, you got a walkie-talkie in here or something?“



„You know where I am, Collin, don’t you?“, my father provocatively pointed out, his voice just a bit more demanding than before.



I was now scanning our entire living space, frantically running up and down the stairs. Even though I hadn’t fully realized the gravity of the situation yet, my body was already in full fight-or-flight mode.



„You hiding somewhere, pops?“ 



Everything seemed blurry at this point. The heavy thumping of my heart drowning out any sort of coherent thought.



„No, no, Collin, it’s far simpler than that. I’m sure you have already realized what is actually happening, right? I mean, my special little boy should have no problem figuring this out.“ His voice grew louder and louder, accentuating his words in ways that seemed unnatural and comedically exaggeratted.



Upon hearing his speech, I was feverishly walking around in circles, hyperventilating while desperately trying to come up with some sort of logical explanation. But my father was right. This entire time, I knew what was actually happening. I just wasn’t ready to accept the fact that my most horrific nightmares seemed to confirm themselves.



„Are..are you really—“



„Yes, that’s correct, my boy. I’m inside your phone!“ my father proudly declared, almost screeching at this point.



That was it. My body seemed to have reached its breaking point and apparently decided to hit the reset button. I felt I was about five seconds away from passing out. I could almost hear the blood and cortisol rushing through my veins, the living room seemingly spinning in a thousand different directions. When looking down at my trembling hands, I noticed that I inexplicably started to cry, as an inevitable sense of dread started creeping up my spine.



"What is happening to me?“ I whimpered under my breath.



Immediately, about a million different memories started shooting through my head. Years and years worth of time spent together suddenly being released all at once. My dad teaching me how to ride a bike, accompanying me to my first baseball tournament, scolding me for my unwillingness to learn Chinese. The man to whom I promised I would one day dedicate statues and museums. The man to whom I could never prove just how much I could accomplish. It was undoubtedly my father speaking through the phone to me.



It seemed like all that I previously believed to understand stopped making any sort of sense. I was an infant again, frightened and fearful of everything around me . Eagerly trying to hold on to whatever sense of security I still had, by trying to convince myself that this was all some sort of elaborate dream. Until the robotic voice from the beginning of the call brought me back to reality.



"Congratulations, the answer to your question was found!“ it triumphantly declared.



And all I could do was listen, as my supposed father continued to rip my world in half.



"You have no greater purpose in life, Collin," my dad coldly stated, speaking in a manner that I didn’t even know was humanly possible. Calculated and bold. Like a machine that was desperately trying to pass the Turing test.



"It seems that you were born to die. Destined to one day turn into meaningless dust. The current human population stands at 7.4 billion. The total number of humans that have ever lived is approximately 100 billion. You are merely one of them. Not born to stand out. Not born to be remembered. It is estimated that your existence stops in circa 40 years. You will be completely forgotten in about 60. An insignificant specter of life that will vanish in an instant. We advise that you enjoy it while it lasts."



Beep.



Beep.



Beep.



Fuck.



I mean, I obviously don’t believe that some form of god just magically appeared to prophesy my future to me. But I guess I’m just really confused right now. Has anybody here had similar experiences? How did they create this AI that could replicate my father's voice, and what can I do to change my supposed future? And if there really is no way out, how should I continue to live my life, knowing that I was never actually meant for true greatness?
