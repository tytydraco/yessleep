I'm not exactly sure how I got here. One minute, I'm going to sleep in my apartment like always. Next, my eyes open to a dark small room, almost like a closet. A door is on one wall, but it doesn't look like a closet door. It almost looks like a front door, of a house. You know, the ones with the squares? But no window on it. I can't quite make out the colours, my eyes are adjusting to the dark as best they can. The handle of the door is round, can't tell if there is a lock, just the doorknob. I’m sitting on carpet, unsure of the colour but it feels like an office carpet. Not very comfortable, more made for function than anything. I'm wearing my pajamas that I wear to bed, nothing in my pockets, no watch because I don't wear it at night.

I get up off the ground and stand on my feet. Was I drugged? Did someone kidnap me? No, that can't be right. I live alone, unless my dog did this which I highly doubt. I mean, I do live in an apartment building, but I don't have any issues with neighbours. Nor are there any creepy ones, at least that I'm aware of. Well, unless you include 308, but I think they are some stoner kids living with a parent. I don’t know, it’s usually a couple of teenagers who always seem paranoid and one older woman. Maybe it’s a sex thing? A Sugar Momma? Ugh, I don’t want to think about that right now. I go to open the door, and the knob turns but doesn't open. I try pushing, pulling, lifting, but it doesn't budge. That's strange, maybe it's stuck? Or maybe it is locked and I'm in danger?

Some time passes, I'm sat on the ground just listening, waiting. If someone really has brought me here, there must be a reason. Eventually, they will have to show up and explain, right? But what if I'm a target, a victim? Maybe I was taken by some maniac who plans on sacrificing me? Is human sacrifice still a thing? Or is that just in movies and shows? Can’t be real. Either way, I can't keep waiting. I decide to call out "Hey! Anyone there? I'm stuck in this room!". Silence. I bang on the door and continue calling out. The stillness of the air is my only response.

Dread creeps over me. Why is someone doing this to me? Am I the only one? Is the room soundproof? That must be it. It makes sense if you kidnap people to put them in a room no sound can escape from. But, if I am to be killed, it's not in this room. It might be dark, but there's nothing else in this cramped space except me and this door. Wait, what about a light switch? I feel my hands along the walls in hopes of finding anything different. The ceiling isn't out of reach, so I try there too, hoping for a light source. But I find nothing. Everything feels flush and smooth, definitely purpose-built. It really is a small space, with nothing besides a door. What is going on? What about a toilet? Am I expected to shit on the floor? This feels so inhumane.

Panic starts to set in. I'm going to die here. I've been kidnapped, and whoever did it wants me dead. They don't even have to kill me, they can just wait it out. What kind of sick and twisted individual would do such a thing? Or, is it more than one? Is it a group? How should I know? I just want out! I can't stay here! Life was going well enough for me, I’ve been seeing Abigail for a few weeks now, my job had a management position open in the office above me that I applied for, and I get on well with my family and friends. Why is this happening to me? Did I do something wrong? Did I upset the wrong person?

All of a sudden, I hear it. Voices. From past the door, maybe in a different room? They aren't loud, so not too close by, but close enough that I can get help! "HEY!" I shout out. I bang on the door, the walls, anything to get attention. "PLEASE! HELP ME! I'M TRAPPED IN HERE!" I continue banging and banging. The voices continue talking, and even some laughter. I can't quite make out what they are saying. "PLEASE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN HERE! DO YOU WANT MONEY? I'LL PAY, JUST PLEASE LET ME OUT!" I plead and shout for what feels like 20 minutes. The voices carry on talking and laughing, my cries go unheard. Or are they ignoring me? Did they put me in here? Are they responsible? Those sick bastards! I start ramming my body against the door, hoping I can break free. I ram a few times, then try kicking the doorknob. Anything, I have to try anything to escape. I don't understand why they won't help me. Can they even hear me? How can I hear them if they can't hear me? I exhaust myself with trying to break the door open but only hurt myself in the process. The voices eventually fade away, who were they? My right arm and shoulder hurts and my foot aches from kicking. I sit back down and just sob.

My mind continues to wander. How could someone have kidnapped me? They must have broken into my apartment, but I would have woken up from the sound. Also, the dog wouldn’t just let someone break in. Well, maybe they would; Prince is only a small Pomeranian after all. Probably piss himself and hide. They must have knocked me out or drugged me. Maybe before? I did go for a drink before going home, but I only had two drinks in a local bar. I saw the bartender make them, no one else could have spiked them. Unless it was the bartender? Fred. But why? I had been a loyal customer to him for years. I mean, maybe only a few times a month, and not spending too much, but I never caused him problems. He even tells me his terrible jokes, and calls me Toby (short for Tobias). But if it isn't him, then who? And when? Is he working for someone else? I just don't understand.

I decide to try and peer under the door, it's not a big gap, but I might see something. I lie as flat as I possibly can, but my legs bend upwards against the wall, there just isn't enough space. But it's enough to look under. Darkness. Just. More. Darkness. I can't make anything out. No movement, no lights from anything electrical or powered, and no noises. Nothing. Just more nothing. What is this place? It feels so intentionally designed. Who would build a dark, soundproof murder basement? I suppose serial killers and psychopaths would. Am I in more danger than I thought? But if so, wouldn't someone have come to check on me by now? I don't know how much time has passed, but I can't continue freaking out. There has to be a way out. I have to be somewhere. Even in the middle of nowhere, I can escape.

But how? I've tried calling for help, I've tried breaking the door open with what I have, and it doesn't budge! How much time has passed? If only I had my phone, then maybe I wouldn't still be trapped in here. Trapped. I keep saying trapped. Am I really trapped? I mean, I fell asleep in my apartment, then woke up here. Maybe I'm not actually awake? Maybe this is just a dream. A weird, claustrophobic dream. Yeah, that makes sense! I shouldn't be freaking out, I should try waking up! I smack my face. It hurts, but I'm still here. I smack it again. Stinging pain, but still trapped. How else can I wake up? Just keep telling myself it's just a dream, and to wake up. Wake up. Wake. Up. WAKE UP!

I'm sat back on the ground. Tears are rolling down my face. I don't think this is a dream. I don't think anyone knows I'm gone. I don't think anyone is coming to help me…

Okay, deep breaths. I’ve got to not give up all hope. Think. What about the walls? The floor? I’m not in some concrete box, right? I stand up and begin knocking on the walls, seeing if anything sounds off. Hollow sounds would be weaker points, right? I tap and I tap. And sure enough, one spot on the wall opposite the door sounds hollow! Okay, let’s not get too excited. I take off my shirt and wrap it around my hand. Okay, let’s see if we can damage this wall. I wind up a hit, and suddenly I hear it. Whistling. I freeze. I don’t like it. It’s chilling, calm, pleasant sounding. It must be who is behind this! I’m frozen in place, a bead of sweat rolls down the side of my face. The whistling gets closer, louder, I can hear footsteps now. Sounds like not everywhere is carpeted. The whistling stops. I hold my breath.

A light switch flips in the other room. Enough light is creeping under the door! I can see my little prison! The walls are a dullish grey colour, I turn around, and the door is a dark green. The footsteps continue, I slink to the floor, back against the furthest wall from the door. I look up, grey ceiling, plaster perhaps? I eye the floor, light blue carpet, definitely makes me think of an office space. I turn to face the door, and I spot it. Two dark shapes in front of the door. Whoever it is, is standing in front of the door. Is this it? Am I going to meet the culprit of my kidnapping? Sweat drips from me as I’m panicking as quietly as I can. Do I talk? Would that be wise? Is that what they want? Why am I here? Who is this? I’m so fucking scared. A jingle of keys breaks the silence. This is it. I’m going to die. Unless I can fight him? Her? What if they aren’t alone? I can worry about that after breaking out of here. I quietly move my legs, I rest a hand on the ground to help myself up. They cough. The hand that I’ve wrapped my shirt in, I wind it back. The moment the door opens, I’m throwing the first punch. I’m not staying here. I’m not dying here. Not without at least trying to escape.

Moments pass, no other noises can be heard. Come on. Come on! Open the fucking door! What are you waiting for? You KNOW I’m here! You PUT ME IN HERE! Just give me the chance. I’m getting angry, so very angry. “Come on you Fucker!” I shout out in rage. More silence. I look down, the shadows are still there. They haven’t moved. Still just past the door. I give the door a kick, “OPEN THE DOOR YOU FUCK!” No response. “What do you want with me?!?” Just more silence. Wait, it’s faint but, it sounds like scribbling. Are they… taking notes? What is this? “Why me? What could you possibly want from me?” I plead through the door. The scribbling stops. They begin walking away. That’s it? What were you writing? Am I just another victim to you? What the fuck is this? I drop to the floor and peer while the light is still on.

The other room is bigger, the walls are a clean white. The floor looks smooth, not carpet. Concrete? Tile? I can’t fully tell. My eye darts around, looking for the person who walked away. I see no one, there is a large opening on the right side, looks like it leads to a hallway? Otherwise, the room is empty. What is this place? The light turns off. Is the switch further away? Maybe more than one? Remote controlled? Could be an app, that’s a thing these days. Damnit! I wish I could leave this fucking room!

I feel so empty. Why? Why did I deserve this? I'm so sorry to whoever I wronged, but I don't think it was bad enough to deserve this! Please. Someone. Just, anyone. Open the door. I need help. I don't understand, and I'm so tired. I'm so so tired. I can't think of anything else to do. Maybe I should just rest, and wait for whatever comes next. My vision begins to drift off…

No! I can’t fall asleep! Who knows what will happen? I have to figure this out. I have to escape. I can’t just die here! But what am I supposed to do?

Wait… the wall! The fucking wall! I turn and face the hollow spot I found before. I knock on the wall again, just to make sure I remember. Sure enough! It sounds hollow! This might be my only option right now. I throw my fist against the wall. It feels sturdy, but not very sturdy. I think… I think I can break this. I throw another fist, then another, and another. My hand hurts, but I can do this. I throw another, and I feel the wall bend a bit. Wood? I run my other hand along the spot, and it doesn’t feel flush anymore! Hope. I have hope. I punch again. The wall makes a snapping sound. I must be breaking it, I can’t stop now. I throw another, and with one more my hand goes through the wall. Oh my god. I did it. I pull my hand back and try to break the opening more. A sliver of light can be seen from above. It illuminates pipes, electrical cables, and some insulation. If I can make the hole bigger, I think I can squeeze in there! I begin pulling at the opening some more, trying to make any leeway, when suddenly a shriek ricochets within the space. I freeze and listen. It sounds… close. Scratching can be heard against a different wall. What the fuck is this place?

A hissing sound startles me. I start to feel lightheaded. Is that… sleeping gas? No! No! I can’t fall asleep! I collapse to the floor, hoping to avoid the gas as much as possible. Then the sound comes from the room next to mine. Fuck! I can’t escape! What am I supposed to do? The sound continues hissing, and I begin to smell something off. The gas is in the room with me, it’s only a matter of time. I try to ram the door again, then I try to throw a punch at a different wall. My vision is getting hazy, I’m slowing down. The gas must be kicking in. I slump to the floor, and my breathing slows. What’s going to happen to me? Is this just some kind of game to them? Like that SAW movie? But I haven’t been told anything. I just know… they’ve taken me… Wherever this is.

When I wake up… I’m getting some answers
