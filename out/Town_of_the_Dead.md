We walked along the train tracks I can hear the cans rattling around in Georges bag. 

I looked up to Jett who was cautiously pointing his bow loaded with an arrow around ready to shoot it if needed. 

I feel a slow calm come over me. At least I have a small group now, I remember when I was alone in the beginning those weeks of being stranded in my apartment were the most alone I had ever felt in my entire life. 

I look over to a very wary Jett and smiled. Finding a random person had changed that. Making my odds to survive whatever hell we were living in that much stronger. 

See I'm pretty sure, my little town was the only place on earth that had zombies.

At first, I thought it was the entire World, but no it was just us.

We knew we had been left stranded by the government a long time ago. Only waiting and biding out time until it finally ran out. Until we became one of those things too.

I remembered how it had felt, back then. In the beginning.

I stared up at my ceiling the screams outside kept waking me up. 

It had been a few weeks since my personal hell had started. I guess technically it was everyones personal hell. Half the population had to be dead already, or was it un-dead already... 

I sneer at the idea, I don't know.

I don't know how to feel.

Why am I even thinking about this. 

I hear a crash and loud stomping feet above me. Must be my neighbor above me getting attacked. 

I need to leave I was running low on supplies. I look over to my last two granola bars and three chip bags. The dim lighting of the night moon shining through my curtains and onto the snacks. Like they were on display for the last food preserved on earth.

I sigh.

I had no more clean water, this was a disaster through and through. I'm going to fight like hell til the very miserable end I will not die without a fight. 

I hear more struggling and screaming above me.

I feel my conviction resurface. I slowly close my eyes forcing myself to sleep. 

A giant bang at my door was my alarm clock. I shot up reaching for my kitchen knife, holding it at the ready watching my door shake with the force of whatever was behind it. 

I can feel myself shaking but if I wanted to survive this I had to stay calm. 

Then my worst nightmare happened the door came crashing in swinging off of its hinges knocking over my desk and cabinet in the process. 

A giant man zombie stood there I felt my shaking hands quivering and sweating, the blade slowly falling from my nervous grip. This was how it was going to end. I made eye contact with the bloodshot red eyes of the giant man. 

He opened his grotesque mouth of blood and sharp teeth with his missing tongue. Then he screams at me like I'm the problem, I suddenly think back to hugging my mom gently and her patting my back. Another flicker of a memory of me playing games with my friends online laughing and telling bed time horror stories. 

I feel a single tear come out of my right eye. This is it the end of my short lived life. 

I can't help but wish for more.
More memories more time. 
Just more.

The man lunches at me and I tear the bed sheets off of me pulling them into a ball to push between the two of us. 

He slams into me laying me out on the floor all grit and muscle on top of me. With only a layer of thick bed sheets In between us. I was full on crying now, I felt like a sad loser but I couldn't give up I had to make this count. 

I readjusted my grip on the knife and with as much force as I could I shoved it upwards into the skull of the monster. 

Down came a pour of blood and other parts that should be neatly tucked into a human face not falling all over mines. 

I closed my eyes and mouth trying to not let it seep into any part of me. 

I Shoved and shoved until the big man rolled over and fell onto the ground beside me. Thankfully he was unmoving. The strong urge to barf hit me hard in my gut. And I did just that all over my attacker. 

I wish I hadn't I had just threw up the last of my food for at least a week. I was officially running on E and I hope that if I were going to be eaten the next couple of days it went quickly. 

I got up I could still feel my legs wobbling unsteadily. I grabbed my last food snacks and shoved them into a carry away bag. I grab a small water filter I had from boy scouts years ago, and a canister in case I found some water. 

I grabbed my only two weapons a kitchen knife and a baseball bat. I put the knife in my bag holster. 

I'm alone. 

I looked around my old apartment I know I won't be if I leave. There's more out there. 

There has to be.

I'm really going to miss this place and the fun I had. My college friends were amazing. The amount of nights I had spent just hanging out with them and eating pizza. The thought saddens me. I walk out cautiously. 

Apparently not cautious enough because one of them must have spotted me it comes running down the hall. I run as fast as I can heading down the flights of stairs I lived on the second story thankfully the stairwell wasn't that long but the hinges were broken on most of the doors and it just kept running at me. 

I needed to hide. 

I still had that guys face juices all over me. I think back to an old zombie movie I watched once where someone put zombie blood all over them to try and blend in. 

I'm not sure if that will actually work or not. 

Maybe I just needed more of their juices. 

Gross why am I even thinking about this. 

I run over to a gate and hop it seeing no way forward. Only to look back and see the zombie use the unhinged door next to the gate. 

Why didn't I see that. 

Gosh I need my calm back I feel my panic set in As I'm almost met in the face with a arrow if it hadn't been for a slight slip of my feet, I would've been a goner. 

I looked up and saw a man holding a bow and arrow shooting with precision. 

Except I wasn't sure if he was shooting at me or the zombie. 

I dodged the other three arrows tearing through the air and all three hit the zombie head on. 

I heard the man say "Headshots all day." I would've laughed if I weren't freaked out by being chased and being shot at. 

I looked back at the fallen zombie and then back to the curly haired man with green eyes. 

"Hey, dude did I scare you!" I look up I guess he wasn't trying to shoot at me he sounded pretty friendly. 

"Yes" I state as he started to laugh waving me over. 

I remember how happy I was to be talking to someone after three weeks of being alone. 

"You ok you're staring a lot." I look away from Jett and up at George our newest companion. 

He doesn't seem very fond of me.

Maybe it's because he realizes I have a giant man crush on his best friend or maybe he was a rich snob from the get go it's really hard to tell sometimes. 

Though I actually think he might just be hiding something. 

I really want to find out what. 

"I'm not staring." 

George moves over to Jett and whispers in his ear.

 "Stop." Jett laughs like he thinks George is being absurd. 

I bet he is too. Hmm. 

We make it to our destination basically unharmed. 

You see we get Internet reception still, we can browse the Internet, we even get electricity still. For some reason they hadn't turned any of that off. I could watch and post as much as I won't, but that was only a one way street. Almost like a firewall was in place for this town.

I couldn't receive messages, I could only send them.

Though it seemed like the government could care less about our water, that was turned off a while ago. We've been blending all kinds of fruits to take their water.

Putting out buckets for when it rained. The whole nine yards anything to maintain positive water levels.

Then I think back to our windmill farm, on second thought it might've been the windmills still giving us power. 

Either way when we got inside to our hideout we checked for creatures and when we found none, we got to getting comfortable. 

Or as comfortable as you can get while also still being on guard, less something tries to attack. 

I walked over to Jett who was sat swinging his feet off of the top of the balcony. We looked down at the beautiful, nature all around us. 

We were in some kind of Inn or at least the remnants of one. 

"Hey, how are you this fine morning?" I say, pretending to put on a country accent. 

He side eyed me. 

"I would've been fine if I hadn't heard that horrible accent." He laughed, I let a quick nose snort out. Then I joined him on the balcony edge. 

"See anything yet?" He nodded towards something. 

I looked over and saw two of those zombies sprawled out on the floor by some bushes. 

"Great shot." I smiled

"Yeah..." He said trailing off. 

"Hey Bozo's do you want some cheese?" Came a povish accented voice. 

We both looked back to see George holding up some very ripe cheese. 

"Aw gross." I could smell it before he was even out the door. 

Jett put his hand over his face covering his nose. 

"Come on, I heard this kind of cheese is supposed to stink, and it tastes better the more aged it is."

I looked to what George was holding. It was a white slab of cheese that looked almost like a cake.

"Wait, isn't that cheese supposed to be carefully taken care of with a temperature controlled room and with proper air ventilation?" Said Jett, like it was obvious. 

He nodded at Jett "it was in proper conditions it wasn't even touched, still sat under the same situation which I'm assuming was the proper way to take care of it."

George looked back to it, like it could solve all of our issues. 

"I'm all good." I said they looked at me, " me too." Said Jett.

"Fine I'll try some." George said as he stuck his finger in the cheese pulling out some of it, then he pulled it to his nose smelled it, licked it, and then he ate it.

I choked at the sight gross dude.

He started choking and coughing and he held his throat.

Me and Jett immediately got up running over " ARE YOU OK!"

"WHAT'S HAPPENING!?" 

followed by stupid laughter from George.

"I got you, you guys thought I was dying from cheese poisoning, how moronic."

I rolled my eyes walking back over to my perch.

Jett laughed and then somehow got talked into smelling and eating some of the cheese. He declared it delicious, but stinky.

I nodded as the two continued eating the cheese.

Wow, that's disgusting.

I walked over " give me some." 

George held it towards me, giving it over.

" If we're all going to be poisoned and die then at least we'll do it together." I said.

Jett smiled. I'm guessing he was happy that George and I seemed to be getting better at not hating each other.

Honestly I wasn't entirely sure that issue wasn't over with just yet.

I put my finger in and scooped out some cheese, I smelt it coughed at the smell. I have no idea why I smelt it, like the smell would be any better, than it was before.

I licked it but I didn't taste anything.

Then I plopped it in my mouth and began to chew. I froze up as the sour dairy taste hit me. Gross it tastes like old sour cream.

But I could totally live through the taste. I kept eating and then swallowed.

I looked at the other two and they just stared back looking for confirmation.

" It's not too bad."

It looks like we had found our dinner, of course we would regret it soon after.

A lot of bathroom go's, seven rolls of toilet paper and a towel later we were all sat around groaning every two minutes.

" It was worth it." Said George in the corner.

I felt a pang come up from my butt to my stomach. "No, it totally wasn't." I said groaning.

I heard Jett let out a groan from outside on the deck as, I heard the ending scream of a zombie and the sound of his bow.

"Never a dull day huh" I say looking to George.

"No, especially not with you around" he almost sounded accepting of me. 

Even though a few day's ago I'm fairly certain he gave me a thinly valed threat, about being Jetts friend and staying too close to him.

I sighed at the memory.

"Can't you do something that's not incredibly stupid." Said George sprinting beside me.

"NANNANANNA!! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"

"Oh, real mature" me and George are running from the thing behind us while Jett gives us cover from up above in the house. 

"Just hurry up and stop nagging grandma" I say sarcastically and out of breath. 

"Well it wouldn't be chasing us if you hadn't dropped a can that loudly." 

"It slipped" 

I heard a dramatic gasp "it did not, you literally threw it into the bag filled with other cans, were you expecting it to sound like a feather. Sorry to break it to you, but a can on can sounds like a heavy metal band." 

"Please George not while we're being chased by a monster. "

"Fine" gosh I hope all rich people aren't this annoying. 

I wipe my face of sweat and throw my cargo bag over the fence. I grab onto the henges and lunge myself over falling on the dirt hard. 

I hear George land before me. I immediately scramble up and grab my bag and keep my fast paced run up. 

I hear the screeching coming closer and then a loud dying 'hlchhh' as the creature finally goes down at Jetts arrows expense. 

I run to the door and hold it open for George as we rush in. I immediately get to locking and binding the door. 

Huffing like a madman. 

"What are you? an idiot?" I look up at George shaking his head at me like he couldn't believe my existence. 

"I Said I was sorry I wasn't expecting it to be so loud, ok." 

He storms off dropping his cargo. I sigh heavily and shake my head trying to let the air flow back into my nostrils. 

I hear footsteps approaching I look up into green eyes. 

"What made George so mad?" 

I roll my eyes at the mention of Georges name. That guy has been a pain ever since he showed up. 

To top it all off Jett seems to have some weird soft spot for him too. I sour at the thought. 

"He's got his rich pantaloons in a twist" I say sarcastically. 

I see Jett make a confused and cautious face. "Yeah" he says it like he didn't know he was speaking. 

I sigh again, he looks me in the eyes carefully watching me like I was a scared animal. I sure felt like one, I hated being chased by those things it always made me panicked for days after.

 I couldn't tell Jett that but I'm pretty sure he could tell somehow anyways. I felt like I couldn't really ever hide anything from him, it's one of the main reasons I regarded him as a close friend with a lot of respect.  

"You ok?" I shake my head yes, but I can feel my palms quivering. He looks down at them and then back up at me. 

He slowly walks over putting his bow on his side strap. 

He holds his arms open for a hug and I silently accept. Feeling a large warmth engulf me, as I slowly close my eyes. I know the world has gone to hell outside but at least I had a friend, someone who cared.

The hug deepens when we put our heads on each others shoulders as he rubs my back comfortingly. 

"It's ok, we're all ok." I smile in contempt at the words.

We pull apart and look each other in the eyes. He smiles at me. I can tell he was just trying to comfort me.

"Hey" I see an angry looking George in the corner we both look over. Jett walks over to the forgotten cargo on the floor getting some cans out and ready for dinner. 

"Hey, yourself" said Jett snarkily. George looked less angry than before. I wonder what his beef was with me. 

"Very clever" said George folding his arm.

Jett laughs softly. 

"Let's eat corn boys" says Jett like that wasn't, last night, or the night before that's meal. 

I shake my head as he walks off carrying a bag of food and random junk that we could consider our snacks. 

George looks at me with annoyance written all over his face. 

"How's it going?" 

He looks like he wants to ignore me. "You're real buddy buddy with Jett aren't you?" I shake my head yes, annoyed already. 

"Yeah we did just spend majority of a year in an apocalypse together." I say sarcastically.

I see Georges eyes twitch and a sigh. "Well back off now." He says like he was chastising a dog. 

"Excuse me." I say "You may be." 

I rolled my eyes why's he being so sassy. "Why're you acting like I'm the bad person here."

He looks up with a downturned snarl like an upset kid. 

"I just was alone for a better part of a year in an apocalypse, I'm going to miss my best friend ok."

"Our" I say trying to make it obvious that Jett was both of our friends. 

We look at each other with snarls. 

"Hey!" We here from the kitchen. "Can one of y'all come over here and help set up a second pot for beans." 

George looked over in the direction that Jett was. 

"I'm coming."

We looked back at each other. 

Why does this feel so annoying. 

I rolled my eyes as he walked out. Maybe it's because Jett seems like he likes George more than me. 

I was the runt of the group after all. The youngest, Jett sometimes treated me like an over protective brother or mother, it all kind of depends on the situation. 

Later on that night came the threat..

 I remember being sat around the fireplace. Doing a night watch when.

"would you ever give him the opportunity?" 

George looks back over to me. "No" I rolled my eyes. This guy was all talk no play. Why?

Was it because he was a narcissist?

"I don't care what he says I can't trust anyone." 

"Is he the exception?" 

I stare at Georges angry expression "yes" 

George had woken up in the middle of the night, during my watch shift to tell me he didn't trust me. 

I feel like me and Jett have known each other forever even though we only met during the apocalypse. Yet his bestie feels cold and angry, the complete opposite of Jett.

Which I guess is what I was like in the beginning of this all too. Cold and angry, scared and sad, y'know all of the usual stuff. 

I shift at Jetts soft snore that makes me look back at his sleeping face, he slept on peacefully while the vibes in the room turned more and more wrong.

"It's commendable I think... How you've turned him into a pile of putty." 

I look back up into intense dark eyes. There was a sense of vengeance in those eyes like I had done something wrong and I will be slain for it. 

"Putty? What do you mean?" 

His accent feels a bit sinister when he talks all vague like this. 

"He was always a workacholic, a hard ass, a stubborn guy." He stops abruptly shaking his head like he didn't get where he was going with this. 

"What I'm trying to say is.. he's hugging you and comforting you like he's known you all his life and I find it despicable."

I furrow my brow because what is he even talking about. 

"Despicable? Why exactly?"

"You did something didn't you to make him act like that to a complete stranger. I thought he was smarter than that. To trust some random. To let them in, to be so weak." 

He shook his head like he thought Jetts decisions were dumb. 

"Well excuse me but I'd consider us pretty close. I've known him for the entire year what do you think we were doing during that? 

twiddling our fingers? 

we're friends"

HA! He laughs obnoxiously I hear Jett shift a bit. 

"As if" this guy is in denial.. like a guy that didn't get his favorite toy at the shop.

Let him be I'm so tired. 
I sigh.
"Since you're up, do you want to start your watch shift so I can sleep?" 

He looks a bit annoyed.
"fine, go nap, I'll watch over" 

No I didn't trust him but I also was incredibly tired. The next problem will show its face soon enough. 

I sighed remembering how my last thought had been of my life before. 

Well.. 

I look over to George he managed to not get us dead, so that's a win in my book. 

I still didn't trust the guy as far as I could throw him.
