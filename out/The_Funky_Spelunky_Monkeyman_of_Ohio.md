My name is Jim Toad. I am the sole survivor of expedition 10-9-7. The government will try to hide the truth,  to cover it up, to keep the public unaware of the horrors I, and my brothers, experienced in the windsor cave system. I’m here to break that silence. This is the real story, unfiltered and uncensored.

It was a blue-bird day on June 26th, 2010. I had always been into spelunking, and frequented many cave systems throughout the wonderful state of Ohio. I never dreamed about doing those crazy ass right crawls that you see on YouTube. The only caves I go into are big, and cavernous. I didn’t see any danger there, at least at the time.

I was a licensed tour guide in the Windsor cave system, which has since been cemented off. Until expedition 10-9-7, I had never seen anything unusual. But one day I was chosen to take a group of tourists through the tunnel, a normal day at work. 
The moment our group walked in, I felt something was off, like something g was…watching us. I shrugged it off, but the feeling never really went away. 
Everything was going as it should have been going, until around 10 minutes into the tour. That’s when the shit hit the fan. 
The opening of the cave collapsed, and it blocked off the only pathway in and out of Windsor cave. I radio’d up, and the guys above said it would take around  3 or four hours to clear all the rubble. We had to wait it out until then.

It was around that time our first member of the expedition went missing. He was a young guy, and we only noticed when we did a head count. We started yelling his name, hoping to find him. What we did find, was something akin to a torture chamber. In the far corner of the tunnel, was his head. Dismembered, lacerated, and next to him was the rest of his body. 
We heard a chimp-like noise coming from the far side of the cave, getting closer with each shrill screech. We had to hide somewhere. At that point, fight or flight had taken over, and I chose flight. I’m still ashamed of what I did, but I just jumped behind a group of rocks, hoping to shield me from whatever that thing was.  I still can’t live with the guilt, knowing I left the other people to die, but if I hadn’t jumped behind those rocks I would have been another victim of the thing. 

Finally, there it was. Standing at around 7ft tall, hairy, and ugly as a bitch. It had claws like 4 inches long and razor sharp. It was horrendous. It had black, beady eyes, and facial features like a gorilla, though its body structure was pretty tall and lanky. Most of all, it stank. Like death, and rotten flesh. 

The thing went on a spree, slashing left and right. I saw one guy get his throat torn out, and another gutted like a fish. It was unstoppable. This spree continued until every other member of expedition 10-9-7 was dead, sliced to ribbons. 

After it was done with its murderous craze, it left, along with some pieces of meat. I must have sat there for an extra hour before the entrance was opened, but it felt like days. 

When I got out, everything felt like a haze. Nobody believed what I saw, but the few guys that went in to inspect the murder scene never got out, either. At that point, they just sealed off the Windsor cave system, never to be entered again. 


I hope that son of a bitch Monkeyman starved to death in there. If not, I hope he’s still trapped. Who knows the damage he would cause if he got out. I don’t even want to imagine it.
