The wind made a low sound in the winter stiff grass of the cemetery. My mother, sister, and brother stood in the cold beside the new earth and I stood with them. We did not look at each other. We looked at the hole.

My father, who had been the warrant for our lives was in that hole, and we were what was left. Four shapeless things set to motion by some old and forgotten custom because the man who gave us shape was in the ground and whatever part of us that knew the right way to stand or breathe was down there with him.

The ride from that place was quiet. My mother (Eleanor) sat beside me and her hands were knotted one on top of the other in her lap. In the back my sister (Clara) had listed against my brothers shoulder (Thomas.) He stared out at the passing dark with the stone face of a boy playing at manhood and I could feel his gaze on the back of my neck from time to time.

We arrived home. The air was choked with the baked meats and pale casseroles of the neighbors, a sick kind of charity that no one would touch.

A woman from next door was speaking. Mrs. Gable. “Eleanor you must eat something. You will need your strength.”

My mother smiled. “Thank you Carol. You are too kind.”

I could not stand the sound of their whispers nor the weight of their pity. 

They looked at us like we were relics of a sudden and common tragedy. 

I would not be one of them. 

I had to leave.

“Mother,” I said. “I’m going to take a drive, just to… clear my head”

She turned her dark eyes on me. They were old eyes. “Leo perhaps it is best you stay. The hour is late.”

“I wont be long,” I said. “I just need some air.”

Clara looked up. “Well, don’t go too far Leo.”

“I wont.” I put my hand to Thomas’s shoulder as I passed.

I woke the engine and pulled the car from the curb and left behind the house with its false piety and its wilting flowers. I had no destination. I just drove. I pushed the car out onto the blacktop and the tires screamed on the turns. 

The houses fell away to fields and then the fields gave themselves over to the woods, a dense and unbroken wall that ran along the old state road. Here I thought I would find a silence I could stand. For some miles I did. Only the engine and the wind that tore through the open window.

The sun was going down in the west and it bled across the sky in violent hues of orange and deep purple. Its beauty was an offense and a blasphemy. The world had no right to such colors when my father could not see them. I pushed my foot to the floor.

And then the engine choked. It coughed once and then again. The steady hum of the motor tore itself into a rattling gasp. The car shuddered and bucked and I wrestled the wheel and guided its dying weight to the gravel shoulder just as the engine quit altogether.

I tried the crank. 

It gave a lone dry click and then nothing. 

I sat there for a long time with my hands gripping the wheel. 

The colors bled out of the sky and left it a bruised and draining gray. I was stranded. On a road that went nowhere, flanked by a black and serrated wall of trees. Miles from a town that was awash in my own sorrow. The last of the sun died behind the treeline and the dark seeped into everything.

And it was in that quiet that the sound came. Drifting from the absolute black of the woods. It was low and it was lonesome and it was the slow aching voice of some stringed instrument.

I believed it to be a cello though I could not say for certain. I sat in the car and listened to it and knew nothing else.

For a long space of time one part of my mind spoke reason. I would have to be a fool to walk into the woods at dusk on an empty road. Thomas would have called me so. My mother would be made sick with the worry of it. And yet, I would have to be a fool to also sit in a dead car. 

The road was empty of other travelers. There were no houses here. There was only me and there was the sound. I reasoned that it was a man and that a man might help me and I pushed open the door of the car. The music was made clearer. It was a tune of impossible sadness. It called to me.

The trees were old, and thick black pines stood like skeletons against a sky draining of its light.

"Hello?" I said.

The cello did not stop playing. 

It only beckoned me onward into the coming dark.

I do not know how long I walked on that soft bed of pinefall but I broke through the trees and into a clearing and I stopped. The thing I saw was wrong and it was right all at once. In the center of that small glade on the trunk of a felled tree sat a man. He held a cello before him and its wood shone with a deep and secret light and he drew the bow across its belly with his head bowed to the work. He was still save for the measured slide and return of his arms. 

The clothes he wore were dark and finely cut and they had no place in such a setting. His hair was the color of a crow's wing and his face was a bloodless pale. He played out the last of the phrase and the final note hung in the air like a soul loath to leave its body and then it was gone and there was only the low hum of the forest night. 

He looked up then and his eyes found me in the gloaming. They were dark and they were deep and there was a great stillness in them as if my coming there was a thing he had been waiting on for some long time.

"Lost, little bird?" He said.

I cleared my throat of a sudden thickness.

"My car," I said, and gestured with my hand back toward the road I had left. "It broke down on the service road. I… I heard your music."

"Ah," he said. A smile touched the corner of his mouth. "It does tend to carry on the evening air. Forgive my lack of a formal concert hall." He set the bow to rest across the strings. "It is a dangerous thing to wander into these woods after dark."

"I was hoping you might have some way to get a message to town," I said. "Or know of a nearby house with a telephone."

The man stood and I saw that he was tall and slender and he moved with a litheness that was not entirely natural. 

"There are no houses for miles," he said, and his tone was soft and I thought I heard pity in it. "And my means of communication are rather more... esoteric. My name is Julian."

"Leo," I replied.

He took a step from the log and I took a step back from him. There was a warning in the deep part of me. He saw this and he stopped and the smile did not leave his face.

"You are burdened, Leo," he said. And his dark eyes looked not at me but into me as if he could see the hollow ruin in my chest. "I saw it on you the moment you stepped into my glade. You carry a heavy weight. A loss…"

The truth of his words struck me dumb. As if he had reached into my skull and pulled the thought from me.

"My father," I whispered. "We just buried him this afternoon."

"I am truly sorry," Julian said, and the words sounded true in a way that nothing else had. "There is no pain like it. The world keeps turning, foolishly, maddeningly, and you are left with an amputation in your soul."

He took another slow step toward me and this time I did not move. 

"What if I told you there was a way to soothe that pain? To quiet that part of you which knows only how to grieve?"

I blinked at him. "What are you talking about? Nothing can do that but time."


"Ah, but time is a crude, clumsy surgeon," he said. He stood now no more than an arm’s length from me and I could feel a coldness coming off him. "It dulls the wound by piling scar upon scar, burying the fresh ache under a heap of smaller ones. But it never truly heals it. The pain remains." He tilted his head like a curious hawk. "I offer something more profound. A release. A gift that rewrites the very nature of suffering. It does not erase the memory, but it cauterizes the wound forever. The hurt will become a thing you observe, like a painting from your past, but no longer a blade twisting in your gut."

His words were a dark gospel sung to the raw and weeping wound inside of me. That part of me that clawed for release was now stronger than the part that counseled fear. I only wanted the pain to be over.

"How?" I asked.

Julian's smile widened and I saw his teeth in the twilight. They were very white. "It is simple," he whispered. 

And his hand rose and came to rest upon my shoulder. The cold of it was a shock. His touch was absolute and I knew I could not move from that spot if I tried. His other hand rose and cupped my jaw and he tilted my head to the side.

"This will only sting for a moment," he said. "Then, the healing begins."

Before my mind could make sense of his meaning he leaned his head to my neck. I felt a sharp and piercing pain, a pain of two points like hot needles driven into my flesh. A gasp was torn from my throat but no cry would follow it. 

A great and sudden weakness flooded the vessel of my body and the world upended itself. The dark trees smeared into streaks of black and the last of my grief and my fear dissolved into a rushing dark. 

The last thing I saw was the darkness of his eyes as he looked down upon me. And in them I did not see malice. I saw what I took to be a terrible and profound pity.

I woke to the steering wheel pressed into my chest. A gray and cheerless light seeped through the glass of the car windows. It was dawn. And the memory of it came back to me. 

A pale face. 

The touch of a cold hand. 

A pain like two spikes driven into the flesh of my neck. 

I sat upright with a winded gasp and my own hand flew to my neck. My fingers found two small hard knots on the skin, like the bites of some strange insect, but I knew in my soul they were not.

I was in my car where I had been. The door was shut. There was no sign of the man Julian, and there were no tracks in the dirt but my own leading to the dark wall of the woods. I did not know if it had been a dream or not.

My body felt… strange to me now. The hollow ache of grief had been muted. I knew the fact of my father’s death but I did not feel the weight of it. And in place of that weight there was a high and terrible alertness. 

On pure instinct I reached for the crank and gave it a turn. The engine caught and tore itself into a living sound, a sound of greater power than I had ever known it to possess. I put the car in gear and I fled that cursed stretch of road.

The familiar streets of my town were different. The clatter of a milk wagon down a side street was like a gunshot right next to my ear. The smell of coal smoke from a chimney a block away was like a black powder in my lungs. The world came at me, an assault on the senses. It was too much.

I pulled the car to the curb before the house and I killed the engine. I stilled myself for what was to come. I saw the curtain in the window twitch and then the door was thrown open and my mother was on the porch. The black funeral dress was still on her. She had not slept.

"Leo! Oh, thank God, Leo!" She came down the steps in a rush and her arms were around me as I stepped from the car. "Where were you? We were beside ourselves! Thomas was just about to go looking for you with Mr. Gable!"

I held her. And through the thin black cloth of her dress I could feel the frantic beat of her heart. I could smell the life on her, the heat of her blood in the veins and the salt of her skin, and some new and ravenous thing woke in the pit of me. I pulled back from her as if from a fire.

"I'm sorry, Mother," I said. "The car… it stalled on the old service road. I must have been more tired than I thought. I fell asleep waiting for someone to come by."

She put her hand to my face and its warmth was a brand on my cold skin. "You're pale as a sheet. And you feel so cold. You come inside this instant. I'll get some coffee on, and there’s leftover ham."

The thought of coffee made me sick. And the image of the ham, of its pink and lifeless flesh, sent a gorge rising so powerfully that I had to clench my teeth to hold it down.

"No, Mother, please. I just… I need to lie down. The exhaustion just caught up to me, I think."

Inside, my sister Clara was at the foot of the stairs and the worry on her face gave way to relief. And Thomas stood in the doorway to the sitting room. His arms were crossed over his chest and his eyes were hard and they questioned me. "Where'd you go?" he asked.

"The car broke down," I said again. And I pushed past him toward the stairs. "I’m fine."

But I was not fine. The house was full of their life, of their heat and their breath. I went to my room and I closed the door on the sound of them. I leaned my back against the wood. And a hunger I did not know clawed at my gut. It was not a hunger for any food I had ever eaten.

I stumbled to the small mirror over the washbasin. The face that looked back at me from the silvered glass was my own and it was not. The skin was tight across the bone and it held the waxy pallor of a corpse. But it was my eyes that held me. They were still blue but there was a new darkness swimming in them, a depth that had not been there before. 

And the pupils were blown wide like an animal’s. And as I stared the man in the mirror parted his lips. And my tongue, of its own volition, went to my canine teeth. And found that they were longer. That they were sharpened to a point.

A great dizziness washed over me. The memory of the man Julian. *It does not erase the memory, but it cauterizes the wound forever.* And the grief was far and distant. But in its place he had put this thing. This cold alertness. This revulsion for food. This awful and unholy hunger. He had given me his gift. And I ran my trembling fingers over the two perfect punctures that lay hidden beneath the collar of my shirt, and I knew. The cost of curing the soul’s grief was the soul itself. I was no longer Leo, a son and a brother. I was something else entirely.

The days that followed were a new kind of hell. I stayed locked inside of my bedroom with my curtains drawn tight against a sun that held a searing malevolence. The pale light that trespassed through the gaps itched and burned my skin.

My family in their grace and their ignorance respected what they took to be my exhaustion. They left trays of cooked meats and bread outside my door and the food went untouched until my mother would retrieve them hours later with a small sigh.

And the hunger grew. My own stomach was a place of disgust for the food of my mother’s house. When Clara would knock and her clear voice would pass through the door it was a torment. 

When I heard the sound of my brother Thomas in the hall, the sound of his hot thrumming life was a tremor of want that went through my whole body. 

I stayed in that room not for myself but for them. For what I had become viewed my family not with the love I knew but with a cold and terrible calculus.

"Leo, please," my mother said through the door on the third night. "Let me in. Talk to me. Doctor Hanes said he could make a house call. Are you ill? Whatever it is, son, we can face it together."

"I am fine, Mother," I called out to her. I was coiled on the bed, my fists clenched to whiteness. The drum of her heart through the thick oak of the door was a lure I could not long deny. "I just need rest. I will be down in the morning."

But on the fourth night the hunger was a tyrant and my body screamed for what it now needed. I knew if I stayed within those walls I would lose what little purchase I had and commit a horror that could never be undone. When the last of the light had gone a fever came upon me and all reason was ash. I had to be out of that house. I had to feed.

I slipped from my room and I passed through the dark house and it made no sound to mark my going. The floors that had groaned my whole life beneath my weight were now silent under my feet. I passed down the stairs like a draft of cold air. I unlatched the front door and I went out into the night.

The moon was a high cold eye in the darkness and it bathed the world in a silver light that was more true to me now than the sun had ever been.

I did not go to the woods. The nature of the thing I was knew that the herd was in the town. I stalked the edges of it and I kept to the black shadows of the alleys and the stone walls of gardens. And every sense was a fire in me, alive to the night and what it might offer.

And then I heard him. The unsteady scuff of his bootheels and a slurred and tuneless song. A man who had come from the side door of Connolly's Tavern, too deep in his cups to navigate the main road. He was a tramp I knew by sight. He stank of cheap whiskey and sour sweat and beneath it all was the rich copper scent of his blood and it was a call to the deepest part of me. I took him in the narrows of the alley behind the butcher’s shop. He was fumbling at his trousers with the slack jawed confusion of the drunkard. He saw me step from the ink black shadows and he squinted his eyes.

"Hey, what you... what you want, boy?" he slurred.

I gave him no answer. 

There were no words for this.

I crossed the space between us in less than a second. One hand clamped to his mouth to quell his cry and the other pulled his head to the side and the vein there pulsed against the night.

The world went red.

There was the brief terror in his eyes and the panicked thrash of his limbs and then a gurgling sound as the hot iron taste of his blood flooded my mouth. And it was a benediction and a damnation in a single instant. The relief was ecstasy, an explosive charge that silenced the agony I had carried for days. The flavor was life itself. Rich and deep and true. It stilled the beast in me.

When the fever passed I fell back from him. The man slumped to the stones. His eyes were wide and they saw nothing. A small dark trickle of his blood had run down his chin and his neck was a ruin. The cobblestones were slick and black with him. I looked at my own hands. At the front of my shirt.

A great wave of revulsion crashed over the calm of the predator. And the boy named Leo was there again, staring at the work he had done. I had killed a man.

I fled into the dark, trembling with a foul mix of satiation and a loathing for myself that had no bottom. I found a horse trough blocks away and I washed myself in the cold clear water.

When I slipped back into the sleeping house the silence was no longer a refuge. It was an indictment. I was the wolf in the fold, a monster cloaked in the skin of their son and brother. The new and terrible keeper of Julian's awful and bloody gift.

"I insist."

My mother said the words in the hall. I had crept from my room for a glass of water and she stood there waiting for me. The light from the downstairs lamps was a hostile glare that made me squint my eyes.

"We will all have dinner together tonight," she said. And her arms were crossed over her chest. "At the table. As a family. The Gables sent over a fine roast, and Clara baked a loaf of bread. There will be no more of this hiding in your room Leo. Your father would not have wanted this."

I could not argue. "Yes, Mother. Of course."

Her face changed. The hard lines of her resolve softened. "Good," she said. "Six o'clock. Thomas will be home from his part time stocking work then. It will be nice. We will get back to normal."

Normal. 

The word was from a language I no longer spoke.

At some minutes to six I came down the stairs. And the smells that rose from the dining room were horrible. The rich scent of roasted meat, a smell I had once coveted, was now the perfume of cooked death. The yeast and wheat of my sister’s bread was like the smell of dry dust.

They were all there when I entered. Clara gave me a small and hopeful smile. Thomas looked at me and his usual suspicion was held in abeyance by his mother’s will. My mother sat at the head of the table near the steaming dishes and her face was lit with the brittle triumph of a woman who had wrested one small victory.

"Leo! Come, sit," she said, and gestured to my seat across the table from Clara. "I will serve you a plate."

"Thank you, Mother, but I can serve myself," I said. 

I placed onto my plate a slice of beef so thin it was translucent. I took a single boiled potato. A sprig of green parsley. I sat. The life that came from them, the heat of their bodies and the rhythm of their breathing and the low thump of their hearts beating just beneath the skin, all of it was an agony to me. The hunger that had been sated but two nights before stirred in the pit of me, a sleeping wolf roused by the proximity of the flock.

"It feels so good to be all together," Mother said. And she began to speak of the weather and of the goings-on at the parish. Clara spoke of a book. Thomas said nothing. He only watched me from over the rim of his glass of milk.

I took up my fork. I nudged the potato. Forcefully, I lifted it to my mouth. The moment its mealy substance touched my tongue my body rose in revolt. My throat closed like a noose and a hot bile climbed my gullet. I forced it down with a swallow of water.

"Clara, this bread is simply wonderful," Mother said. "Leo, you must try a piece." The basket was passed to my hands.

I took a piece and I tore a small corner from it and put it in my mouth. All I could think of was the man in the alley. All I could remember was the glorious and terrible torrent of his life.

"Is something wrong, Leo?" Clara asked. "You look as though you've eaten a lemon."

I pulled my lips back from my teeth in a thing that was meant to be a smile. "No, not at all. It's… delicious. I think perhaps my stomach has shrunk from not eating properly these past few days."

Thomas set his fork down and the sound of the silver on the china was a sharp report that silenced the table. He was looking at me.

"You haven't swallowed a single bite, Leo," he said. "I've been watching you. You just move it around the plate."

"Thomas, that is enough," Mother said.

"No, it's not," he said. And his eyes never left my own. "Something's wrong with you. You're always cold. You never go out during the day. Your eyes look... strange. And you haven't eaten a real meal since the day of Father's funeral. Don't lie and say you have. We can all see you haven't."

A great silence fell over the room. The ticking of the clock in the hall was the only sound. My mother stared at my brother as if he were a stranger to her. And Clara’s gaze went between us and her bottom lip began to tremble. All of them looked at me.

A low pressure built behind my canines. 

My hands below the table had taken the napkin and were twisting it into a knot. 

I had to leave. Now.

"I don't feel well," I said. I pushed my chair back from the table and its legs shrieked against the polished wood of the floor. "Thomas is right. I'm not hungry. Forgive me."

I did not wait for their reply. I turned and fled from the light of the room and from their living faces. I took the stairs two at a time. I shut the door to my room and I locked it and I collapsed against the cool wood of it. My body trembled with the thing it held inside me. And from downstairs I could hear the sound of their voices. Muffled and urgent. My mother's reprimand. My brother's hot defense. My sister beginning to cry.

The lie was cracking.

A week passed in that house and it was a week of coldness. I became a ghost in my own house, a creature of the upper floors and the deepest hours of the night when I might slip down for a glass of water from the tap.

My brother's suspicion was a wall between us now, and my mother’s love was fear.

The hunger in me had been fed. But it was a patient beast. It was coiled and it was waiting. And a thing stronger than the hunger rose in me now, a need that drove me from the house. A need for answers.

What was I? 

And what were the laws of this new and cursed earth I walked upon?

There was only one who knew.

That night, when the house had fallen into a sleep that was not restful, I went out from it. The car answered the crank. It did not fail me now. I drove the miles of dark road back to the place where everything had changed. I parked the car on the patch of earth where the man I was had died. I went to the wall of the woods. The path to the glade was not a memory in my mind but now a new instinct in my blood.

"Julian!" I called to the darkness. "I know you are here. Show yourself!"

There was no sound. I stepped into the trees. The branches that reached for me I broke with a strength I had not owned before.

"There is no point in hiding! You did this to me. The least you can do is explain!"

"Such impatience," a voice said. It came from directly behind me. I turned and he was there. Julian, leaning against the great trunk of an oak. "Patience is a virtue of eternity, Leo. You must learn it."

I did not have the time for his philosophy. 

"What did you do to me?" I said. "What am I?"

He pushed himself from the tree and walked toward me through the gloom. "Is it not obvious?" he said. "I gave you the gift I promised. I have made you like me. Immortal. Strong. Keen of sense. You are untethered from the sluggish, inevitable decay of your kind. We are predators at the apex of the world, beings of the night." He paused. "Or rather, you are a confused fledgling who blundered through his first feed like a clumsy animal. I heard of your work in town. Very… enthusiastic." 

A cold shame washed through me. "He was a person," I said. 

"He was sustenance," Julian corrected. "Cattle have names, too, I'm sure. You mustn't get attached. Sentimentality is the anchor that drowns our kind. It roots you in a world you are no longer a part of."

"My family… I cannot eat. The smell of their food makes me sick. And when I'm near them… I feel..."

"The hunger," he said, and he nodded as a scholar does at a simple axiom. "Yes. Their beating hearts. The sound is louder to a newborn like yourself. It takes a discipline you do not yet possess to live beside them without seeing a meal. It is a skill, I confess, that I myself have found little use for."

"But this, this is not a life," I said. "I am a prisoner in my own home. The sun…"

The amusement left his face. "Ah, yes. The great Tyrant Sun," he said. "That is the one true law. The price for what we are. You are right to hide from it. Direct sunlight is death, Leo. A swift and ravenous death. Avoid it as you would the very eye of God."

“So that’s it? I'm condemned to the shadows forever? To hide from them, and starve for…"

"For blood," Julian said. "Say the word. You must accept what you are. That is the only path. You crave the essence of life. Red blood. Human blood. Your life is measured now from hunt to hunt." He stepped closer and the unnatural cold of him washed over me. "I chose you, Leo, for the great darkness I saw in your grief. I thought to grant you a life where such pain had no purchase."

"You did not cure my pain, you made it eternal!" I said to him. "I will lose them all, my mother, my sister, my brother, and I will still be here when they are dust. Your gift is a curse."

A strange and knowing sadness touched his lips. "Perhaps," he said. "Or perhaps you have not lived long enough in its shadow. A century from now, when their faces are but a painless echo, you will see the mercy I have given you." His words were the words of a madman. "Now, go home, fledgling. Learn control. Your family is your first and greatest trial. Live beside them. And we shall see if you are a shepherd or only a wolf. The choice, as they say, is yours."

He turned then. And he did not walk into the woods but was consumed by them, the deep shadows pulling him back into themselves until he was gone. I stood alone in the moonlight. I was chilled not by the air of the night but by the terrible and lucid knowledge of what I had become. He had given me the laws of my new life, and a challenge. To control the beast. Or be devoured by it from within.

And so I went out into the night to do the work that must be done. I took to the lonely roads between our town and the next. The drunks and the tramps of my own streets I left to their miserable sleep. Their disappearances were too close to home. instead, my hunts were for men who traveled alone, for farmhands returning late from a distant field. Julian's cold catechism was my guide. I learned to be a clean and silent predator. The bodies I gave to the deep woods and the earth took them without comment.

But my brother was not a man for illusions. He had our father's eyes and our father's unwillingness to abide a lie. The sickness I had claimed as my shield had grown thin with the passing weeks. He watched me. And he knew the man I had been, and he saw the wrongness of the thing I had become.

He chose his time. One night when I was coming from my room to go out upon my hunt. To take a drive, I called it. Mother and Clara were abed. He was waiting at the foot of the stairs. A shadow standing in the greater shadow of the hall with his arms crossed over his chest. He barred my way.

"Out for another drive, Leo," he said.

"Yeah, the night air helps clear my head," I said. And I made to step around him.

He did not move. His eyes, so like our father’s eyes, held mine. "I do not believe you," he said. "Mother chooses to believe. And Clara is too afraid not to. But I do not. I have been watching you. Since that night."

"Nothing has changed," I said.

"Everything has," he said. And he took a step toward me. The living heat of him rolled off his body in waves and the coiled thing in me stirred. "You are stronger. I saw you move that heavy crate of Father's old books in the attic last week like it was nothing. I remember it took both of us to get it up there. And you’re colder. Mother touched your arm this morning, and she said it was like touching marble." His voice went lower. "What happened on that road, Leo? What was done to you?"

I tried to keep my voice flat. "You are letting your imagination get the best of you. I am only grieving."

"This is not grief," he said, and he shook his head slowly. "Grief makes you weak. It makes you cry. It makes you need people. You... you are the opposite of that. You avoid the daylight. Where do you go every night? Tell me the truth, Leo.”

"There is nothing to tell," I said. "I am handling my grief in my own way. And I would appreciate it if you would stop keeping watch on me like I am a criminal and let me live in peace."

He stood there. "You are not him," he whispered. His eyes fell from mine. "I do not know who you are. But you are not my brother."

And with that he unbarred the way. He stepped to the side. The small war he had been waging was over and he had lost. I passed him by and I opened the door to the night. I could feel his eyes on my back, the eyes of a stranger. I knew as I went out from the house that the last door to the man I had been was now closed and barred forever.

The quiet dread my brother had harbored began to seep from the walls of our house and bleed into the very soil of the town. The disappearances of lone men, scattered by miles and weeks, began to spread to the public. At first it was whispers over fence posts, then a low murmur in the general store. Then, the matter was made ink and given a name in the *Creek Valley Ledger*.

"Another Traveler Vanishes on County Line Road," my mother read aloud one evening. Clara’s hands were frozen over the bright colors of her embroidery. Thomas stared into the fire place. I stood half swallowed by the shadow of a velvet curtain.

"Authorities issue warning," Mother went on. "Travel after dark on the less frequented roads is ill advised until this… this rash of 'unexplained incidents'… has been resolved. They suspect wild animals. A bear, perhaps, or a cougar."

In the charged stillness that followed her words, I felt the shift. Three sets of eyes, a silent and unified inquiry, turned to me, the family’s nocturnal traveler. The animal they spoke of stood among them, cloaked in the skin of their son, their brother.

In that moment, a terrible clarity descended upon me. My presence in that house was no longer a comfort but a slow and creeping contagion. My deceptions, my spectral comings and goings, my very unnatural being had not just cut the fabric of our family; the predator I contained was now casting a long and bloody shadow upon the world they inhabited. To protect what remained of them from the rot I carried within me, I had to excise myself from their lives.

It was the final and only act of love the monster I had become was capable of.

That evening, I did not retreat to my room. I remained among them, a silent witness to a life I was already outside of. I watched my mother in her chair, her nimble fingers mending a pair of Thomas’s socks. I watched Clara at the desk, the glint of lamplight on the pale gold of her hair as her lips moved silently, forming the words she composed in a letter to our aunt. And I watched Thomas, who sharpened a small pocketknife with a whetstone. He never looked at me, but I knew he felt my gaze.

I committed every detail to the long, empty vaults of my memory. 

The gentle slope of my mother’s shoulders. 

The nervous way Clara tucked a stray wisp of hair behind her ear. 

The hard calluses on my brother's hands. 

I was burning these memories into my endless mind, a final, perfect memory of all I was about to abandon.

Hours later, when the house lay in the absolute stillness, I made my preparations. I had packed nothing. My old life required things. My new one required only me. 

I took the small amount of money I had. In my room, a hard knot formed in my throat. 

I took up a pen and on a single sheet of foolscap, I composed my last lie.

*Dearest Family,*

*I must go away. There is a sickness in me that I cannot cure by staying here, a restlessness in my spirit that will do more harm if I remain. Please, do not try to look for me. Do not grieve for me. Think of me only as having set out on a long journey. I know you will not understand, but know that I am doing this because I love you all more than words can say.*

*Yours in memory,*

*Leo*

The ink was not yet dry when I laid the note upon my pillow. I slipped from my room and stood for one final moment in the upstairs hall. Their heartbeats, a steady, tripartite rhythm of life, was the last true music I would ever hear.

I descended the stairs and went out into the night. I did not take the car. I would simply walk. I would walk until the sun became a threat on the horizon, and then I would find shelter and wait for the darkness to grant me passage once more.

And that all happened in 1918. 

That was the last time I ever saw my family. 

The world went on. It remade itself and remade itself again. Quiet towns became loud cities.

I learned to live in the spaces between. Chicago. New Orleans. San Francisco. New York. I never stayed long in one place. My face did not change and people, in time, would notice.

I was once a watchman in a factory that built weapons for a war my brother may have fought in. 

I was once a bartender in a jazz club full of smoke. I served liquor to men and women who thought their lives were endless. Their beating hearts told me a different story.

I became the predator Julian had envisioned. Clean. Quiet. Untraceable. I learned to hunt other predators. The brutes in back alleys, the swindlers who fed on the hope of others. It was a rule I made for myself, a small thing to keep the man I had been from turning to dust inside me.

But my family did not turn to dust. My curse was a perfect and unforgiving memory. Their faces did not fade. The final quiet evening in the sitting room was a scene I could not forget. I learned that love did not require a beating heart, and grief did not scuff or wear with the passing of years.

As time went on I began my search for them, I dug through the dry archives of counties and the records of men. I peered into the lit screens of microfilm, and later, swam in the great black ocean of the internet.

I found it all, piece by agonizing piece.

In a society paper from 1925, I found Clara’s wedding announcement. She had married a doctor from Philadelphia. There was a photograph, a grainy black-and-white image. She was beautiful in the style of the day. She looked happy. I hoped the man was a good man. I hoped he made her laugh. I wondered if she ever spoke of her brother who was lost.

One night in the archives of a Midwestern city, I found the name of my brother. It was on a list of men who had fought in the Second World War. *Thomas Alden Croft. Private First Class.* He had survived. He was the man our father would have wanted him to be.

The decades passed like the turning of a page. It was the 1950s. On a buzzing microfilm screen, I found the notice of my mother’s death. Eleanor Croft, 1878-1952. An obituary. *Beloved mother of Clara Bellweather and Thomas Croft… Preceded in death by her husband, George, and her son, Leo, who disappeared many years ago…*

The year is 2025. A six lane highway is in place where the service road used to be. Cars move at a faster speed, their passengers are lost in small, glowing screens. I stand at its edge.

When the sun is a final red smear on the horizon, the ache begins. It is not the hunger. I cross the manic highway, slipping through the river of traffic like smoke, and enter the quiet of the woods. Some of the old trees are still here.

I come out into the town cemetery. It has grown in the last century, a creeping city of stone that has swallowed the fields. I walk past the new graves. My feet know the way to the old section, where the marble has been worn soft and blind by a hundred years of rain.

I stand before a simple family plot, marked by a cross of graying stone. My heart always feels as if it tries to beat here. I kneel on the cool grass. My eyes do not need the light to read the names.

I touch the first stone.

*ELEANOR CROFT*
*BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER*
*1878 - 1952*

A long life. She had seen her grandchildren. I hope they were a comfort to her.

Next to her lies my sister.

*CLARA BELLWEATHER (NÉE CROFT)*
*A LIFE FULL OF GRACE*
*1902 - 1988*

She saw a man walk on the moon. Did she tell her children a ghost story about the pale brother who walked into the night and never returned?

And Thomas. Brave, honest Thomas.

*THOMAS ALDEN CROFT*
*A DEVOTED HUSBAND AND FATHER*
*1904 – 1965*

He died too young. The war had perhaps taken its payment late. Or life had. He had been a better brother than I was given the right to be.

Then there is the last spot. A marker for my father, his dates ending just before my own story began. And next to it is a wide and hollow stretch of green earth. There is no stone for me. The boy named Leo Croft had simply vanished. This empty ground is my only monument. I am forever here beside them, and forever gone.

This is all that is left of the boy who grieved for his father one hundred and seven years ago. My grief is not gone. It has been made pure and eternal. Julian was wrong. He did not cauterize the wound. He encased it in amber. The pain of their loss is as it was in the first moment.

The moon is high now. My lone shadow falls long across their graves. I am alone now. For all the time that is left. The hunger, the hunt, the life in the shadows, that is not the curse.

This is the curse. This vigil. This memory that will not fade. This is the horror. To be a living monument to a dead love, haunting the graves of my own past. 

Forever.
