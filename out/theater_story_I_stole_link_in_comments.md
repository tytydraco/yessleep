After working as a janitor (at a *haunted-as-fuck* movie theater of all places - but that’s another story) the absolute *worst* part (aside from disembodied voices calling your name, seeing things out of the corner of your eye, etc) was cleaning the women’s bathrooms.

Sorry ladies, but you’re goddamn animals when youre alone in a bathroom stall.

And those sanitary boxes? *jesus. Goddamn. FUCK*.

I am desensitized to *a lot* after scrubbing those toilets and wiping down those bathrooms

**edit**

Because I should elaborate on the theater, this is from an earlier post when I addressed this:

When I graduated college, I moved back home and got the job as a morning cleaner at the local movie theater (shift 4AM - 10 AM) The guy who interviewed me was a scruffy guy named Jeff. I remember he asked me the typical questions, if I was OK with working weird hours, cleaning up vomit, etc. What struck me as odd was the last question he asked; “do you scare easy?” I kinda laughed and said no.

The job was pretty easy, all things considered; throw this away. Mop that. Scrub this. Take out the garbage. You’re by yourself for a majority of the shift, so we were allowed to bring our iPods with us. The theater was large, its layout was shaped like a T, with the lobby and bathrooms in the stem, the smaller theaters on the left and the larger, IMAX screens on the right. Running above the theater hallway was the projection area, an equally long hallway with a couple of small offices and all the projector equipment. If you were the first to arrive in the morning, you had to go up a winding staircase and turn on the lights in all the theaters. It wasn’t a big deal, except with all the lights off, the building can be as Jeff once described, ‘a little creepy’. The projector area was full of promotional materials, including a sea of cardboard cutouts from all the movies that have played in the theater. Sometimes the theater manager would have giveaways and the staff could take home some of the items. Pretty cool, but when the lights were off, it looked like a sea of people in the hallway. Another part of our job was to meet with the day manager, who looked a little flustered when he explained to me that women were complaining about a tall, lanky man in a suit that had been following them from theater to theater, sometimes into the bathroom. 

The last several months, several had come to the front desk, describing a 7-foot tall man in a black suit, complete with bowler cap, walking slowly after them. A few times even the police were called. Teenagers that worked the day shift referred to him as "The Tall Man".

We had 12 theater rooms total, but theater 5 was the worst. Nobody wanted to clean it out. When I first started, I was fairly naive about what was going on, and I didn't understand why Jeff was apprehensive about Theater 5 and kept assigning me to clean it out. What made Theater 5 unique was that it sat behind the bathrooms in the lobby, so to get to the sitting area you had to walk down a long hallway before reaching the screening room. Being that far back you were the most secluded, especially when it's 4AM and the only other people you're with are on the other side of the building. People cleaning there would complain of nosebleeds, constant headaches, and a feeling of being watched. Theater 5 always gave me an uneasy feeling, like I was being watched. One day, I was sweeping out garbage from under the seats when I hear footsteps. Someone running. I look down at the front of the theater, and I catch glimpse of a little blonde-haired boy turning the corner into the long hallway. Immediately, I threw down my broom and chased after him. I ran down the hallway and out into the lobby, where the kid had disappeared. I walked further into the lobby and saw Jeff outside the front entrance, smoking.

"Who was that kid?" I asked. Jeff looked at me, for a moment he was confused, and laughed. "So you met Charlie?" Charlie was another entity customers complained about. On several occasions, they claimed a little blonde haired boy was running up and down the aisles in the theater, causing all kinds of noise and ruckus during the movie. Of course, it was in theater 5. When an usher would come to apprehend the child, he’d be gone. The female staff affectionally named him, "Charlie", after his resemblance to the character in Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. Charlie was also responsible for knocking several cans of garbage over, misplacing things, making our janitorial duties a pain in the ass. We used to theorize that he was the son of The Tall Man, but the two were never seen together. It took that experience for Jeff to admit that “some people have seen and heard some things”, which was his way of saying the theater was haunted. I found it odd, considering the theater was relatively new…it was built in the 90s, on some wet lands. According to some people that lived in the area, the property was owned by a family who sold it off back in the 1980s. There was no evidence of foul-play, it wasn’t an indian burial ground. It was just a weird place where strange things happened.

I got more, but Reddit mobile is being really weird and not letting me post more. 🙄

**edit**

Because I’ve been asked to elaborate further, and (one of the events) what finally drove me to quit:

The theater basement was used for storage. I’d give a better description but that’s as much as I know, I never went down there. I remember that Jeff gave me a couple of bags and told me to drop them off in the basement. I said I didn’t know where that was. He pointed down the hall. “Last door on the left," he replied. I started walking and he stopped me. “Don’t go down there by yourself,” he added. “There’s a lot of shit down there and I don’t want you tripping over anything.”

This morning it was Jeff, myself, and a co-worker named Trevor. Trevor was on the other side of the building cleaning out a theater. I could hear his leaf-blower running (we use them to blow popcorn out of the theaters) I didn’t want to bother walking across the building to grab him. Jeff walks out of the lobby to have a smoke. I’m by myself at the far end of a dark hallway. I open the door and I’m looking at a long staircase that drops into darkness. I flip the light switch to my left. There's only a flickering light at the bottom step. Nobody ever went down there to fix it.

I heard a door open from the lobby. Jeff hadn’t returned, I’m just hearing things. I look back down the staircase. I’m about to descend when I hear a voice from the bottom of the steps. “Hey!” It’s a low, raspy voice. I pause. “Hey, c’mere!” it says again. There’s a shadow bleeding in from the bottom of the staircase. I can’t tell what it is, but it’s definitely a person. “Hello?” I call down. I don’t know why I did, I know that I’m the only person on this side of the building. I know that there isn’t just some person hiding out in a dark basement. At this point my heart is pounding and I’m starting to sweat, because I know this isn’t normal and I’m experiencing something that shouldn’t be happening.

“you gotta to see this! come here and look!” it says again. The voice is a little louder.

It sounds like someone with a cold. The shadow is bleeding further into the bottom of the steps. Whatever’s down there is coming closer. I toss the bags down to the bottom of the steps, turn off the light and walk back down to the lobby. Jeff is walking back inside. I tell him about what happened. He almost looks irritated when I tell him I was going to go by myself. “Nothing here is going to hurt you,” he said finally. I will never not be shocked at how casual he was about this whole thing. Later on, I told Trevor about what had happened. We went back to the steps to investigate, and when I turned on the flickering light, the bags I had thrown were gone.
