Hello, I am Mary, and I am a huge fan of hiking. It honestly has been my stress reliever from all the stress I have at work. Because of the pure tranquility of the woods. With all the animals and flowers and trees. So now you know that I should probably tell you why I'm writing this.   
  
So, it all started today as I was driving out to a forest I've never been to before. It was quite a long drive due to how far it was. And once I reached the opening, I began to notice just how big and dense it was. I saw a few watch towers.  
  
So, it took a few hours to find parking. And once I parked, I noticed that it was just me and one other car. It was black and had tinted windows. I didn’t think much of it because I doubted I'd ever come in contact with this person. And I began to hike a dirt trail.  
  
From what I could notice the trail was only indicated by Hula hoops on the dirt floor. I was confused by this as I was walking down the trail. But suddenly my attention to the Hula hoops was broken. When I heard what sounded like Hula Hoop being moved! I looked around thinking that there was someone behind me! I could not see anything.   
  
I just chalked it up to some animal tampering with it. And continued down the trail. As I kept waking, I could continuously hear the beads inside the Hula hoops jingle. And so, I shouted out “Is there anyone there?” There was no response and I stopped hearing the Hula hoops.  
  
As I kept waking, I needed to look behind my back continually! After a few hours, I felt safe enough to continue walking. After what felt like hours, I began to notice that the sun was setting. And suddenly the unease came back!   
  
So rather than continue to walk the trail I began to head back. Unfortunately, as I was walking back, I found out what the Hula hoop noise meant. Somebody removed the Hula hoops! This made it harder to tell where the trail was.  
  
So, I was lost trying to find my way to my car. And unfortunately, it became night!! So, I took my phone out of my pocket and turned on flashlight mode. And as I kept walking through the woods and shining my light out to see if there was anything following me. I heard a twig snap!  
  
Suddenly I started running around trying to find my car. I found a shed. As I went inside, I noticed that it had a shelf containing the Hula hoops from the trail. I then heard footsteps from outside! As they kept approaching, I began to fear who they were. Then the door opened!  
  
Just then I saw a man in a forest ranger suit. He asked me “What are you doing out here at this time of the day?” I told the man “I got lost trying to get back to my car!” the man then said to me “It’s dangerous to be out here in these woods, especially since the recent disappearances!”  
  
Suddenly my heart stopped. And I started thinking about that black car and how the driver might have been following me. So, I asked the man “Can you walk me to my car?” the man told me “Tomorrow I will, so right now let’s head back to my watch tower!”  
  
And so, as I was following the man we began to have a conversation. I asked him “What’s your name?” He told me “It’s Kevin!” and after a few minutes we were at the tower. Kevin told me “I have to get some supplies from the shed so why don’t you go up the tower before me!”   
  
So, Kevin then walked into the shed next to the tower. As I was about to head up, I noticed something. There were other footprints from other women going up the tower with Kevin but only Kevins were coming down the steps!   
  
I suddenly realized that if I go up these stairs I am never coming back! So, I turned off my phone's flashlight and ran into the forest. I kept running and hitting trees in the dark for about a while before I felt safe from Kevin.   
  
I turned on my flashlight. But this time I made sure to dim down the light. And kept walking. After a few hours of walking, I found the parking lot. I felt safe thinking I could drive away and leave this forest behind. But then I noticed something. There was a man inside my car!  
  
I ran away from my car knowing that my one salvation was taken away. I am currently hiding in the shed with the Hula hoops. I've barricaded the door with a shelf holding the Hula hoops. I’ve called the police. But I doubt they’ll make it in time!   
  
I am scared of what Kevin is going to do with me. And honestly, the worst part is I don't think he will make my suffering quick. I just hope that if the police do find my body, they can at least arrest Kevin. But I doubt that! This might be the last thing I post so goodbye!
