Let me be clear, he’s not stalking me. He’s watching, like how you might absent-mindedly zone out while watching TV. I don’t even think he’s looking at me, it’s more like he’s looking *through* me. Sometimes I wonder if he sees me at all.

He’s always standing there. Mouth agape, drool dribbling down his chin, eyes unfocused and glossed over.

No matter what room I’m in, as long as there’s a window, he’ll be looking in from the other side. Even in rooms where I could have *sworn* I closed the blinds I would return to find them completely open, exposing me in full view to him.

I have no idea why he’s started doing this. I just moved into this place last month, and up until this point, everything had been great.

I even introduced myself to him the day a couple of days after I had settled in. He seemed like a perfectly normal man from my brief visit; I brought over some baked goods and we chatted for a little bit.

He introduced himself as Mr. Hollis. In between bites of cookies he explained details about his life, such as how since his kids all moved out and his late wife’s passing he’s been living alone for a while. I sympathized with him and genuinely thought he was a sweet old man.

Nothing about him was off in any way, and I remember leaving feeling glad all of my neighbors had been friendly so far.

It just makes no sense why he’s doing this.

This started about two weeks ago, I think. I work from home, and my desk is set up right in front of a large window that faces his living room. I usually keep my blinds open to let the sunlight in while I work.

I didn’t even notice him until I got back from the bathroom. Hell, I have no idea how long he was there before then.

My body became numb and my heart stopped, frozen in place the moment I spotted him. He stood right in front of his open window, eyes not quite locked onto mine. My panicked reaction was to close the blinds and run off to another room, but of course, as I turned the corner I saw him staring through that window as well.

I wave at him. I shout. He never even shifts his gaze to look at me. It’s like I’m not there at all.

It never seems like he’s actually looking at me. It’s always near me, or past me. I look around but I can never see what he could possibly be so invested in.

Even while I’m typing this now I keep looking up, and through the small gap in my broken blinds I can see him standing there. It’s like a taunting reminder that I still need to get these replaced.

I’ve tried putting curtains up, sheets, *anything*, but I don’t think it stops him from watching.

The other day I just wanted to open my window for a little fresh air while I worked. I’ve had the window to my office covered for the past week, so I was hoping he was busy or wouldn’t notice me taking it down. I think I’ve been more paranoid not seeing him.

I peeked behind the bottom corner of the fabric, pulling it up as little as possible just to take a glance outside. Of course, he was there.

I tested this a few more times, and no matter what window I did it at, he was on the other side. It’s like he somehow just knows where I am in the house.

After that incident I’ve just kept the curtains open again for peace of mind. It makes me feel safer when I’m able to see him.

He hasn’t changed his clothes in the past two weeks. I don’t think he even moves other than to follow me around and stare. It even looks like he’s soiled himself, and his eyes are completely bloodshot.

I’m honestly getting really freaked out at this point, and borderline angry. I really don’t know what to do. I’m thinking about confronting him tomorrow and seeing if he’ll at least talk to me or give me some kind of explanation for what he’s doing.
