“If you feel scared while you’re dreaming, stay in that dream.

If the fear ignites your skin, wrapping around your throat while you blissfully dream, stay asleep.

If you hear a noise that wakes you up out of your control, keep your eyes closed.

If you hear footsteps that you can’t place, keep your eyes closed.

If you feel something touch you, no matter what it feels like, keep your eyes closed.

If something speaks to you, even if you recognize its voice, keep your eyes closed.

Closed eyes until the crest of the sun shines through the window.”

I have had these words engrained on my mind for the last few days, since I awoke to my worst nightmare realized.

My beloved Bobby.

My perfect, kind, sweet fiancé. Who never hurt a fly.

My wonderful Bobby laying next to me, eyes open in terror, mouth fully opened in a silent scream. Staring at the ceiling.

I screamed when I awoke to him and saw his state, I cried and checked his pulse. Crying out his name for him to come back to me.

“Bobby! Bobby! Wake up! Don’t leave me, please don’t leave me here alone!”, I sobbed.

Once the police had come and asked me a million questions, and the coroner had collected his body, the police asked me one more thing.

“Is there a camera?”, the officer asked me.

“We have one in the living room that faces the kitchen, it’s wired to our phones.”, I responded, wiping my tears with my shirt sleeve.

“We will be needing access to that,” he said, clicking his pen away, “Just to check on some things.”

“You mean.. to check if I somehow killed him with something from the kitchen?”, I asked, rage filling my eyes.

“We have to rule it out Miss, don’t take it personally.”, he grumbled.

Once the officers had cleared out of our home, he turned to me once more.

“And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry for your loss.” He said with a frown.

Then he was gone.

I couldn’t sleep a wink the next night. After calling everyone we knew, and delivering the bad news over and over while fielding questions I couldn’t answer, I was exhausted.

Exhausted but wide awake.

I couldn’t sleep in our bed, that was our bed. I couldn’t smell Bobby there.

So I made myself a spot on our couch.

I put on a show, and tried scrolling through my phone when I saw I had a new email.

It was the detective assigned to Bobby’s case, who asked to see the footage from last night.

I sighed, and opened my camera app.

I exported all the footage for the last 24 hours and sent it over with a highly unsatisfying woosh.

I couldn’t bring myself to look at it.

I couldn’t see us cuddled up on the couch together, laughing while watching a movie.

I couldn’t take more pain.

Once the tears began to flow again, I locked my phone screen and left it on the coffee table.

I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, until I finally drifted off.

I dreamt of me sitting in a lonely bus station, I seemed to have no destination as I watched people get on and off their buses and go on their way.

I sat still, watching the passengers, when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise.

I turned around, and found no one watching me. Actually, the station in my dream had emptied, but the feeling had stayed.

I kept looking backwards, looking for the cause of my paranoia, when the color of the bench I was sitting on turned from blue to pink.

Oh, I’m dreaming.

I watched the colors, and wished I could say goodbye to Bobby. When my cellphone rang.

It was apparently in my pocket, and I held it up to my ear.

I hit answer, but the phone continued to ring loudly.

“Hello? Hello?”

I hear muffled words through the dream phone.

And a familiar voice.

“Bobby? Bobby???”, I asked, in a new panic.

His voice was muffled, mixed with static, and the ringing.

But I could make out a few words.

“Don’t… Wake… Close.. Eyes!!!!”

The ringing from my phone grew louder and louder, and I felt myself waking up.

“Why??”, I screamed into the phone.

“It’s.. Not… Me..!”

I feel myself fading more and more from the dream.

“What’s not you??”, I scream.

“It’s…. WAITING!”

My eyes shot open.

In my delirious state, I looked around my dark house, then at my coffee table which held my traitorous phone ringing loudly.

My brother calling me back, after his night shift.

I swipe the call to answer and run my hands through my hair.

“Hey Jay….”, I mumble.

After another tearful call, I put my phone back and lay down on the couch again, putting my hands over my face. Sighing deeply.

Then I hear it.

A soft clink of glass.

I freeze, hands still over my face, covering my eyes.

Another soft clink.

My breathing turns harder, and I know my hands have started to tremble.

I then hear footsteps walking towards me, a low growl emitting from the direction of my kitchen.

I stay frozen.

“Babe? Babe, are you here?”

Bobby.

I start to cry in relief, and begin to move my hands when Bobby’s words from my dream haunt me.

“It’s.. not.. me!”

I freeze again.

“Baby, there you are. It’s me, wake up baby, oh I missed you.”

I still don’t move.

My dream felt so real, maybe I am dreaming again, and if it’s really Bobby he will still be here by morning.

“Babe? Come on..”

I feel cold hands grip my wrists, tugging lightly to pull them off my eyes, but I hold strong.

“Move your hands. Now.”, Bobby’s voice demands.

The cold hands grip me harder, trying to yank my arms down, but I hold on.

That’s not my Bobby. Bobby has never spoken to me coldly and he would never grab me like this.

“Move them or I will take my time with you too.”, his voice seethes at me.

Too.

I’m sobbing, but I keep my eyes covered, my hands violently shake.

And for hours, Bobby insults me, yells at me, pleads with me, bargains with me, just to move my hands.

But I don’t.

After it was quiet for a while, I felt the warmth of the sun start to rise through our window.

I shakily move my hands down, and find no one there.

I whimper, because I wanted to be wrong.

I get out a piece a paper and write down every lesson I learned that night, and that whatever this thing is, it most likely took my Bobby.

I’m tucking the piece of paper into my phone case for safe keeping when I get a call from an unknown number.

“Hello?”

“Hello, this is Detective Michaels. I’ve been working Bobby’s case.”, a gruff voice answers.

“Oh, yes. Yes, I’m here. Have you found anything?”, I ask, wrapping my blanket around my shoulders.

“Well we analyzed your living room camera, and we found Bobby. He woke up at about 2am and walked to your living room, he just stood there for a few minutes facing the wall. Then, he turned and went back to your room.”, he said, I could hear his pen scribbling something down through the phone.

“Okay..”, I tell him, willing him to keep going.

“And the coroner got back to me just a few minutes ago, and we can clear you off this case from their findings.”

“What did you find?”, I ask timidly.

“Well.. it appears Bobby had a type of heart attack in his sleep..”, he continues.

“A heart attack? He was perfectly healthy!”, I snapped, still protective over him.

“This wasn’t.. It wasn’t a health thing, Miss. It didn’t go on the official report..”, he paused, and lowered his voice into the phone, “I’ll tell you what the coroner told me, and she said it’s just what she thinks but she’s never seen something like this before.”

“Please tell me.”, I demand.

“She said.. She said that with how Bobby’s face was, that he saw something. We don’t know what.. But…”, he trailed off.

“But what?”

“She says she thinks he was frightened to death.”

I pause.

“That’s not possible.. that’s not real. That can’t happen..”, I mutter into the phone.

“It can.. It is rare, but not impossible.”, the detective corrects.

I’m silent, what could Bobby have seen to.. to… I can’t even think it.

“And Miss.. a word of advice.”, Detective Michael whispers.

I’m silent.

“All I’m saying, is that if my partner was scared to death right next to me, and it didn’t even wake me up, I would only think of one thing to do..”, He says, while rustling a piece of paper in the background.

“What’s that?”, I ask.

“Move. Sell your place, go far away. And pray to whatever you believe in that it won’t come looking for you next.”, he explains.

“But Detective.. what if it already has?”, I ask.

He’s silent for a moment.

“Well, then I’ll start praying for you too.”
