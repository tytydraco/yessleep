“You know when you look around laying in your bed, in your room that is filled with nothing but darkness. You sometimes see a shadow or someone. We often blame out imaginations of curse ourselves for even thinking such stupid thoughts.

But what if… what if i told you all that it was true? The shadows you see do exist they-“

“Ashley”, as i was typing the text i hear a sound from outside the bathroom. No no no please no. I put my hands on my mouth and close the phone. For a moment everything is still… very very still. The last thing i hear is just the click of the door as it unlocks.

This all started 6 months ago, after my mother’s funeral, I was desperate, alone and depressed. My father wasn’t the most attentive. One day after coming home from school i sit at the computer, searching for ways to talk to my mom one last time, after about 30 minutes of browsing the internet, I come across ouija… I know I know… typical freaking horror story. But in my defence i didn’t know that it… would… give birth to this horrible horrible creature. 

I order the ouija board, after some time it arrives and that night i sit in the dark, alone and light the candle in my bed, I circle around the board with the chip once. “Mom, are you here?”, i wait for a minute. “Mom? You here”, i repeat. After a while i hear nothing, i see nothing, i feel nothing. I put the plank chip on goodbye, the second i do it flew towards a corner of my room. I look at where it is and… it’s completely dark, but it’s almost as if i can feel someone? 

“Mom?”, I whisper, the second i do, I hear someone smack the sweatshirt that is hanging behind the door. My feet move on their own and i run outside the door. Once out, I chuckle, not knowing whether i should be happy or afraid, my mum was back. The woman who gave birth to me was back.

I walk inside again, my steps purposeful and careful, I open the door to my bedroom and turn the lights on, with my heart ready to come out of my mouth any second. The room fills up with light and… nothing. I see no one but the plank chip on the ouija board was on hello.

Wait. I’m sure i did put the chip on goodbye rather than hello. Why is it on… hah must be the wind. What else would it be. I take a look around while holding my breath when i see nothing I put the ouija board under my bed and get in bed to sleep.

At midnight i’m woken up by the sound of the front door opening, i’m pretty sure it’s just dad. 
Still sleepy i put my blanket over my head- wait a minute. Wide eyed i stop in my tracks. Even if i want to move i’m too terrified to move. I… it must be my imagination right? There is no way a 7ft dark figure is standing in the corner of my room. No way right? I try to reassure myself. I stay like this for a while before gaining enough courage to check. Slowly I put my blanket down and let my eyes adjust to the dark, there was nothing. 

Or atleast I thought so.
