I guess this must be the right place to ask for help. no coffee nor redbull has worked so far

 it's not like I'm narcoleptic, it only happens at night, at the correct hours, eight willing or unwilling continuous hours of sleep. Recently i realized I had never tried not to go to sleep before, my mom didn't let me go to sleepovers or long trips without her. I used to be very tidy, very clean, I would go to bed all by myself at ten, even in college. Not anymore. 

I work for a Swedish furniture company, the prototype people send me the boxes and one of any versions of the instruction manual, I build them in my medium size apartment filled with other furniture. I'm their model customer. I take detailed notes of difficult or confusing moments, add any suggestions for fixing the issue and why it's important. It’s a meticulous and demanding job; every extra twist of the screwdriver is noticed and archived.  

It’s usually a piece a day, then I do the same with the disassembly, that usually takes half a day and I ship them back alongside the folder or binder with the analysis. I can usually do and undo three big units a week. But not always, not this time. The designers must've been a young group, sons of bosses toying with psychotropics and a Memphis group - new age revival. Grotesque colors, mismatching sides and even a bloody new packaging. They wanted me to “experience” the making of the bookshelf; they wanted me to “put my own creative input” and said something about “modular” nonsense.  

This diabolical shapeless mess cost me the day, I didn't even finish the bookshelf and next in line was a night table and a bureau, i could not take it. I had a drink for the first time since New Year's Eve and collapsed on my sofa, even the thought of dismantling that clownish thing was daunting. I left it as it was, got myself something to eat and left the dishes for tomorrow me to handle, I remember that, i never do that, i was tired and stressed and fuck fuck fuck fuckfuckkfjñnlgffdsl 

Those dishes, they were fucking clean and dry in the morning.

It was a weird experience, confusing mostly. I continued with my day but could not get it out of my mind. I knew, I know I didn't wash them, is there someone here?  

The bookshelf was somewhat finished I guessed, it didn't look like a finished thing but I had no more pieces left. The bureau was worse, way past my schedule and still hadn't finished most of it, now the screws and planks were everywhere. I used to be very tidy, very clean, everything in a bag or colored box. Now a mess of screws, hinges, doors and pommels in my carpet, in the “bookshelf”, in the balcony... I had another drink and left it all there, like Nero left Rome after the fire. 

In the morning, as if no work was ever done, the bureau was boxed, not a splinter, not a nail nor nothing where I left it; it was all in the now sealed shipment box.  

I stood looking at my livingroom for what felt like hours, trying to explain, trying to have the strength to set foot in the living or the kitchen. I was sure there was someone here and was messing with me, I kept looking at corners and shadows, trying to catch something. I was going to catch the intruder, so I set a trap, I left both dirty dishes in the sink and the condemned bureau scattered in the room, I drank some coffee and waited behind a plant, my phone recording behind a vase.

Again, as if no work was ever done, the bureau was boxed, the dishes clean, my phone charging beside me and I in my bed in pajamas. No video from yesterday. I was livid.

Two red bulls and a spy-cam I bought with same day delivery, dirty kitchen, dirty living room, i also took a shit and didn't flush. Last time i checked the time it was 23:07, i fell asleep and again, everything clean, the spy-cam in a box with the return sticker printed and ready to be refunded in the app. I was not livid anymore, i was terrified and my toilet was shitless.

help me not to fall asleep again.
