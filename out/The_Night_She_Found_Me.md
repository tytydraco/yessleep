The air in my cramped little apartment felt off that Tuesday night, thick with a weird unease that stuck to my skin. It was just past midnight when the storm outside killed the power, plunging the city into darkness. My phone, laptop, even the fridge’s hum, all gone silent. I cursed my cheap landlord under my breath as I groped for a flashlight, stubbing my toe on the coffee table in the process. That’s when I heard it: a faint rustle, like dry leaves scraping the pavement, coming from the living room. I told myself it was just the wind rattling the windows, but my gut twisted with doubt.

Growing up, my uncle used to spin wild tales about Nyx over campfires, his voice shaky with a mix of fear and awe. He’d describe her as a shadow-woven goddess, stalking the night to snatch lost souls. I always rolled my eyes, figuring it was just his way of spooking me after too many beers. But as I limped into the living room, the cold hit me like a slap, and that rustling turned sharper, more purposeful. My flashlight shook in my hand as I swept it around, landing on the curtains swaying despite the closed window.

Then I caught her reflection, or thought I did. A woman stood behind me, her shape a swirling mess of shadows, her eyes like bottomless pits. I whipped around, heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat, but she was gone. The rustling stopped, replaced by a low hum that buzzed in my chest, pulling me toward the corner where the darkness seemed to breathe. I should’ve bolted, but my legs felt like lead, rooted to the spot.

The shadows pulsed, and there she was—Nyx. She was beautiful in a way that made my stomach churn, with sharp cheekbones and a smile that didn’t touch her hollow eyes. Her hair flowed like liquid night, and her gown writhed like living shadows. In her hand, she held a glowing orb that pulsed with the hum. “You’ve called me,” she said, her voice soft and melodic, wrapping around my brain like a lullaby I couldn’t escape.

“I didn’t!” I stammered, stumbling back, but she glided closer, the orb floating toward me. It felt like my soul was being yanked out, memories flashing, nightmares from when I was a kid, that time I got lost in the woods, the panic attacks I’d tried to forget. I clawed at the air, desperate, and then the lights flickered back on, flooding the room. Nyx hissed, dissolving into smoke, but not before whispering, “I’ll return when the light fades.” The orb vanished, and I hit the floor, gasping for air.

The storm had passed, but that hum stuck with me, a creepy reminder of her words. Since then, things have been off. The lights keep flickering, and shadows linger too long. Last night, I found a footprint in the dust by my bed, too small to be mine, with weird claw marks. I’ve been Googling Nyx nonstop, digging through old forums and dusty books, but it’s all scattered bits, some say she’s a night guardian, others a soul collector. One guy online swore she leaves a cold spot as a mark. I checked today, and sure enough, there’s one by the window where I first saw her. It’s growing.

I’m a mess, hands shaking, barely sleeping. I’ve been keeping the lights on, but the bulbs burn out fast now. Last night, I woke to that hum again, louder, and saw her silhouette in my doorway. She just stared, those eyes drilling into me. I haven’t slept since. I’m thinking of ditching this place, but where do you go when the darkness follows? The landlord ghosts me, and my neighbors act like I’m crazy when I mention the hum. Maybe she’s got them too.

I’m writing this as a heads-up, a desperate shout into the void. If you live alone and hear a hum during a storm, don’t check it out. Lock your doors, blast every light, and pray she skips you. If you find a cold spot, run. Because once Nyx marks you, the night doesn’t let go, and I’m pretty sure she’s got me in her sights.
