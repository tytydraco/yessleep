For a little context, My name is Noah, and I have just received a letter from the mother of my best friend who supposedly committed in the summer of '91. The reason I say supposedly is due to the amount of questions I have concerning what led up to his death, and the letter that I have just been sent.  


This morning I received a text from my best friend, Elijah's, mother, confused and accusing me of hiding letters that her son sent to me before he passed away. I had no clue as to what she was talking about, as up until the news of his death, I hadn't heard from Elijah since at least the year prior. She sent me the letter (imgur link below) over text, and asked. I read over them, realizing they were addressed to me, and asked where she had found them. She said that while she had been cleaning through his room to renovate a place for her brother's grandkids to visit, and found the paper stuck in the grate of the air vent.  


After reading the letter, I'm concerned that there might have been something foul surrounding Elijah's death.

1. Elijah was never diagnosed or suspected to be any type of schizophrenic or any other mentally ill title, which is why it's extremely jarring in the first place that he committed in general, not to mention the letter.
2. During the time, Elijah was in high school and going through a rough spot with money, which is why I'm assuming he couldn't afford to send letters over a couple states to me. We were best friends though, which makes me extremely worried that he didn't even attempt after these dreams out of possible paranoia.
3. Elijah was an all A student with an extremely bright future ahead of him. For him to suddenly do what he did with no rhyme or reason, plus this letter popping up, it only leads me to believe that something might have happened regarding these 'dreams' to cause him to do such a thing.

It could just be a gut feeling, but I really don't think that this letter coming out all these years later is a coincidence. We were as thick as thieves, and I doubt that something as simple as money troubles would prevent him from getting this letter to me. I also have a feeling there might be more than Elijah's mother is letting on to, which I will try to ask about soon enough.  


Also just to add, I'd appreciate any advice regarding this phenomenon or any other related things that could provide context. I'll be driving down to Elijah's old place in the next few days to see if I can find anything else out about this. He was my best friend, and it just doesn't feel right letting this be the last thing spoken about him. I'll try and update if I find anything, but I'm not all that tech savvy, so bare with me. Thank you again.
