Hello there, I’m writing this about 10 years after this story takes place but I thought I should share it here because it was recently brought up at a family dinner. My family and I were sitting around the dining room table, we usually talk and banter around dinner time as it helps us connect as a separated family (My twin brother and I live out of town and my other siblings are in and out of boarding school). My brother had brought up a story about that time one of our cats went missing and turned up pregnant 2 weeks later, we all thought he was a boy so it was a funny little anecdote. However, that story must’ve stirred a memory in my dads brain as he turned to me and went,”Enid, remember that time you saw Milo after we put him to sleep?” My stomach flipped at the sudden memory, “Yeah…freaky…”, I said slowly. 

Milo was our long-term cat, he was grey and we got him before I was born. He had died suddenly when I was 9 of kidney failure, I remember mourning his loss terribly. Milo had a funny temper to him, he was selective about who he liked and who he really liked. He would scratch and claw people that would walk past him but we just attributed that to him trying to get attention in the worst way possible. I loved that cat with all my heart, he would sleep on my bed and I had the responsibilities of feeding him. But, when Milo came back something was strange, like something subtle…but definitely there.

I remember that day well, my mum came into my room and put her hand on my shoulder, “Milo didn’t make it…”, and I cried and cried. Following his untimely death, we had him cremated and put his boxed ashes on a shelf with the other pets we had lost throughout the years. About 2 weeks after Milo's death I was starting to calm down, I had grown to accept that Milo was dead and he wasn’t coming back. My family never filled that space that Milo left, and I find it strange, not the lack of a new pet to scramble over but over the convenience… that space that was left felt filled. I remember feeling the same presence I did at night. I could sometimes feel the pressure of a cat on my bed or soft purrs as I drifted off to sleep. At the time it was a comfort but now I know it was a horrible precursor. 

It started at night, usually later after my parents had tucked me into bed, I would see him jump onto the bed and curl up by my feet. It was so real, it was my cat. I would stroke his fur and feel his purrs. The first time it happened I cried, I felt scared and confused but in my head I rationalised that it was the ghost of my cat saying goodbye, because I was 9 and that seemed logical. Eventually it became a routine. Mum and Dad would tuck me into bed and eventually Milo would jump onto the bed from seemingly nowhere, curl into a ball and sleep. By the time I would wake, He’d be gone. 

As the nights persisted Milo would lie closer and closer to me and every night his time for appearing would be earlier and earlier. It got to a point where my parents would turn off the lights as they closed my door and Milo would be there, standing so close to my face staring at me. At that point he began to speak to me. Telepathically. 

The first thing he said was, “would you like to visit me and the other cats sometime, like how I visit you?”. His voice sounded like a stacked whisper of different voices gently bouncing back and forth in my brain. Still, he stood there staring and I began to notice his dull eyes. They were darker, and smaller and almost completely covered by some form of cataracts. Yet, for some reason the idea of visiting Milo and “the other cats” seemed inviting, I imagined myself, for a moment, in a heavenly cat world seeing other cats. I remember feeling… excited. Like I was special, that I would go places no other little girl had gone but as I was about to answer Milo vanished, like I had just blinked him away. 

The following night was the same, Milo offered to take me to the other cats but left before I could answer. At some point I remember there was a time when Milo wouldn’t show up. Sometimes I’d just see a glimpse of him under my dresser or behind my large dollhouse, just watching. Usually he would vanish when I noticed him or when I tried to patt or “psp psp” him onto the bed. I do, however, remember the night he spent behind my dollhouse staring at me, he had stayed staring even after I tried calling him onto the bed and after I tried to blink him away. 

Eventually I had fallen asleep still feeling his gaze and I was partially awake at a point in the night to feel him standing in his usual spot on my bed staring at me, this time without saying a word. When I look back on that night I realised that Milo was looking at me like prey, like a small vulnerable creature, something far weaker than himself. 

I remember keeping Milo a secret from everyone else, I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be the only special girl who got to go where no other girl has ever been. I think, just maybe, if I had told my mum or my dad, Milo probably would’ve stopped and left forever… and I remember not wanting Milo to leave again. I remember accepting him as he was, and just being so grateful for his presence again. 

The next night was the last time I saw Milo. The routine carried on as it did the first night. Mum and dad came to tuck me in and after they had turned off the light and shut the door milo had jumped onto the bed. He had curled up into a ball by my hip and purred. At some point I had fallen asleep and Milo had woken me up, it was still dark outside. He stood next to my shoulder and asked, again, if I wanted to visit him and the other cats. I responded. I said yes, but this time instead of blinking him away as I always did, he stayed. Milo jumped off the bed and turned his head back to look at me. He didn’t say anything but I knew to follow him. 

We walked out my room, through the hallway, down the stairs and into the kitchen. Our back kitchen door leads to the open street where we park our cars and it’s kept locked at night with a key we keep in our spice drawer. At this point I knew Milo wanted to take me outside, So I opened the drawer, took the key and slowly unlocked the door as to not make a sound. 

Closing the door behind me I was hit by the chill of the cool night air. Milo walked, weaving in and out of my feet, eventually sitting beside me. I stared out at the road as the occasional car drove past, I had never been outside like this by myself before and it felt oddly exciting. 

I looked down at Milo as he faced the road, “I’ll show you how to visit.”, he whispered at me and slowly made his way to the road. I walked with him too, although I kept myself curbside. He walked onto the middle of the left lane and flopped down onto the road. I felt my nerves jolt as he whispered “It’s so easy…”. At that point I could see headlights in my peripheral, and could hear the engine of a car and at that moment my heart dropped. Milo was still lying in the road, waiting. 

Then it happened, The car drove over him, I turned my head away from the scene but I heard it all. The squelches the cracks of bone and flesh, and the impact of Milo under the tire. Part of me thought that if I looked I wouldn’t see what was left, as Milo was a ghost cat, but I turned and saw a flat mess of red. I ran inside, slamming the door, not even locking it behind me and ran straight into my room. I was frantic and panicked. I got into my bed and under the covers, heavily breathing to myself. Then I heard him “You didn’t do it? You didn’t visit”, I looked up from under the covers and saw him, whole, as he was 3 minutes prior. He stood on the edge of my bed and I felt myself being consumed with fear. 

My dad must have heard the commotion of the outside-kitchen door slamming and me running to my room as he had opened my bedroom door. Milo vanished assoon as he turned on the lights. My dad looked at me, I was shaking, hyperventilating and had pissed myself out of fear. He stopped and asked if I was okay. I don’t remember how I responded and I don’t remember what happened a few days after the incident, but Milo never came back. I never spoke about it until I was about 11, I was so scared nobody would believe me. Although after my dad found me covered in piss and freaking out, I was sent to a multitude of doctors and psychologists. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD and it was assumed that I had been assaulted yet, obviously, there was no evidence to support that claim. Doctors also wanted to consider schizophrenia, exploding head syndrome and even autism. My family was left with no answers to my behaviour and doctors left it as anxiety. Although everything fizzled out when I slowly reverted back to normalcy. I still struggled to sleep over the fear of seeing Milo again but he just never showed up. 

Oh, and if you’re wondering about the road kill, I had made my dad check the road from his bedroom window to see if a cat got run-over, he was confused but obliged as maybe he thought clarification would soothe my nerves. He came back to my room and said that there was no sign of an accident. 

2 years later and I felt far removed from the anxiety and stress of Milo, so I told my therapist the story and she encouraged me to tell my parents. I only told my dad. After that I got a late stage diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia and started taking antipsychotics. 

Fast forward to the present day and now I’m rehashing the entire story to the rest of my family. I asked my dad why he never told mum or at least another sibling about the Milo incident and he said, “I didn’t want to freak them out.”, confused, i added, “but it was just a hallucination, why would it freak them out if it wasn’t real?”. Dad paused, and I reconsidered my response. 

“Enid, that night, a cat was run over.”
