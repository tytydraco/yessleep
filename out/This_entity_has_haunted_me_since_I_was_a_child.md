(A Brazilian story) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· 

When I was just six years old, my family moved to a city in the countryside. From the first day we visited the house before purchasing it, we noticed something strange. It was full of yellow and white candles scattered throughout the rooms. The saleswoman looked uncomfortable, as if she wanted to tell us something, but kept it secret. We thought it was nothing important.

We moved. The house had seven bedrooms, and mine was a long way from my parents'. In the first few days, everything seemed peaceful, despite the constant burning smell and the feeling of being watched. I chalked it up to my childhood imagination. But soon things started to change, especially with our animals.

Our dog looked terrified. Whenever we approached, he barked desperately and looked as if something was hiding behind us. At night, he wouldn't stop barking, which led my mother to give him away. I was sad, but I still had my aquarium with fish.

Over time, the fish began to jump out of the aquarium. We put up a screen to prevent it, but the next day, the screen appeared out of place, and the fish died. My parents thought it was strange, as no one touched the aquarium. This continued until all the fish were dead.

We tried to ignore the events and move on, but the last month in the house was a real nightmare. One night, I woke up to go to the bathroom. The window in my room was closed, and the street light illuminated the room. When I sat down on the bed, I saw the silhouette of a tall man standing at the foot of the mattress, watching me. Fear paralyzed me. I went back to bed, pulled the blanket over my head and started screaming for my mother, but no one came. I continued screaming until I wet the bed with fear.

The next day, I asked why no one had heard my screams and told them what I had seen. My mother got goosebumps. She confessed that she also saw strange things: shadowy figures and, some nights, she felt as if someone was hanging her. But, thinking it was just imagination, he never told me. After that, I stopped sleeping alone.

After a few weeks of upsetting events, we decided to move. It was then that the neighbors told us the truth: a murder had occurred in the house, and the previous residents practiced black magic.

Even after the change, the torment did not end. I kept seeing strange figures, I had nightmares and bouts of sleep paralysis. I was never able to completely free myself from that presence. She was always there, watching me, bringing chaos into my life, like a shadow that would never let me escape.

The apparitions got worse when I became depressed at the age of twelve. I've always heard that evil spirits take advantage of people's fragility to attack. It makes sense: it's easier to torment someone who is already vulnerable and hide your presence as if it were just another problem the victim faces.

At this time, I spent most of my time at school or at home sleeping and cutting myself. I felt immensely tired, and whenever I lay down, whether day or night, something strange happened. The mattress dipped slightly, as if something was climbing on top of me. It was as subtle as the touch of a cat's paws. However, whenever I got up to check, it stopped immediately. The times I tried to ignore it, the sensation got worse: something heavy lay on my back, immobilizing me completely. I couldn't move a muscle, much less open my eyes, but I knew I was awake, fully conscious.

The episode that marked me the most, and that made me fear sleeping for many days, happened one morning. I felt something pull my foot so hard it almost dragged me out of bed. My heart raced, and, overcome with panic, I jumped out of bed to run away. But as I reached the door, I felt an invisible force pull me back. Before I could react, I was thrown against the bed and, as if on command, I immediately blacked out.

After that, I decided to force myself to stay awake. I started drinking excessive coffee, listening to loud music on my headphones and avoiding going to bed as much as possible. Still, things didn't stop. I saw the bedroom door opening on its own, dolls falling off the shelves for no apparent reason, and clothes slowly sliding to the floor when I was distracted. These phenomena seemed to just wait for the right moment to torment me. Things only started to get better when my depression eased. It was then that I asked myself: was this entity the origin of all the evil I felt?

Today, I no longer see anything, but I still feel its presence. It's as if it's lying in wait, waiting for me to weaken again so that it can restart the psychological terror that marked my childhood. I still get scared at night, but somehow I can deal with it better now. Still, I can't help but wonder: Will he ever really leave me alone?
