Even as a six year old, I was smart and could easily survive on my own. Everyday I would come home from school( all alone), eat what was left in the fridge, clean my room and do my homework. After I’ve done my Chores I would always go outside and play with my friends or the dog “Schinken” who was the nicest dog in the world. As I looked outside, I noticed that nobody was there but it wasn’t strange. The weather was bad and the sky looked so grey that it could rain any minute.But even Schinken wasn’t outside( he is a stray dog) which was really weird.



 But not even the bad weather or the strange absence of everyone could stop a small little girl like me from going out and having fun. After five minutes of running down the stairs, I finally made it to the yard . Even though there was nothing happy about a sandbox and a slide that we all were too afraid of to use( I heard there were ghost under it), I actually felt pretty nice. Nice but boring. 



I really didn’t know what to do, so I decided to just stand by the slide and look at the ground. After ten minutes of daydreaming , I got woken up by a weird sound. It was not a sound that a human or an animal could make. It was not talking, screaming, meowing. It was just a sound. But even though this situation was everything but normal, the six -year -old me wasn’t scared. I was still in a good mood and a little curious about what I was hearing . And as I looked at the Source of the Sound I saw them. And even though I met them for the first time, I understood that these were not humans, animals or monsters, just them. There was an it with legs and arms like ones of a marionette and white skin. There was an It with missing eyes and no real skin . There was an it with a mouth like a fish and limbs twisted as if they were broken. And even an it with white skin and a hole for a mouth.



 They were all smiling. And I smiled back, saying:” hello!” They continued to smile and after five minutes of looking at each other I decided to dig in the sand box, so I said:” I will play in the sandbox” and started my work. At first nothing much happened but after some time I saw something hidden in the Sand. As I continued to dig it up I finally saw what that was. First I dug up a paw, then a tail and after two minutes I saw Schinken. “Oh, hello Schinken”, I said “Schinken?”This is when I understood why the dog wasn’t answering.



 And as I looked at my paranormal guests, I understood that they weren’t smiling.I was very fast for six year old so I managed to run to my Flat in ten seconds and close the door on all keys. As I looked out of the window I noticed that no one was there. No one except the dead dog who was once called Schinken. After some years I’ve kind of forgotten about the incident, life moved on and so did I.



 But one time I was sitting in my Flat looking outside. There was no one but a small girl… who was talking with the air. And after five seconds of looking at nothing , the girl decided to go to the sandbox. But no she did not find a dead dog or even start digging in it. She just looked at me and smiled. I already knew that smile.
