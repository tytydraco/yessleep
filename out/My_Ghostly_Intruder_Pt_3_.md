 To get caught up with me finding out I'm living with a little demon. I heard someone scream, I ran to the back to see the girl with long black hair staring at the teen as he moved my pencils around drawing a pentagram on my wall. 

She had her mouth covered in horror her face looked paler than it should have. I walked over, "are you kidding me?" I say to the teen clearly messing with the woman. 

She looked on the verge of passing out. 

The others soon arrived in my bedroom. "What happened?" Questioned Amber "What did you do to her?" Questioned Billy. 

"WOAH, woah, now!" I say frantic that the situation was about to probably spiral out of control if I didn't stop it. 

"I didn't do anything to her, she screamed and I was just the first to arrive." I say feeling defensive.

We looked back to her and then she shakily brought her hand up and pointed at the pentagram, and the teen that was sat beside it. 

I saw Amber raise an eyebrow "The kid did that?" She said without missing a beat. 

Now I finally got to feel the slight enjoyment of not being the only 'crazy' one in the building. Everyone looked at her spooked. 

"The boy?" She said like it was obvious. "He's sitting right there." She pointed at him like she thought they were messing with her. 

I started laughing, and stopped quickly as she gave me a warning with her eyes. 

"What are you laughing at?" 

"They can't see him." I stated, I saw a moment of confusion pass over her face before she nodded. 

"Nevermind, guys continue what you are doing and ignore the floating tools." She said like this wasn't weird.

They all looked at each other clearly still freaked out. She walked out waving for the kid to follow her. He got up smirked at me and ran out to follow her. 

The group looked at me. "Y'know I never got everyones names." I started trying to calm down the energy in the room. 

"Uum.." said the woman with long black hair "I'm Lena" she said then the other red head next to her said "I'm Casey." The guy nodded "Billy" I nodded back at them. 

"Cool." Everyone seemed a little uncomfortable so I tried to move things along again. 

"Y'all can take a break if you'd like?" 

They all started walking to the front of the house and sat around on the floor I heard the two girls whispering franticly to each other. Billy just kept staring around at the walls, like something was going to jump out at him and he'd have to punch it back down once it tried to. 

I walked over "Does anyone want shakes?" I say trying to make everyone feel less on edge. "

Then I heard a shout from the back "YOU'RE LYING!" I'm guessing Amber and the ghost teen were talking about his deadness. 

The group looked behind me, which I guess was because of the abrupt shouting. Then I saw Billy and Lena start to get scared and pale again. 

"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?" Questioned Billy now frantic.

I shook my head, it sure was easy to get these people worked up. "It was probably just Amber talking on the phone with someone." 
I say ... Trying to dust off that wrinkle from my pants. 

"NOT AMES! WHATS THAT!" I spin around and see a giant black and purple spiraling hole opening in my roof. 
 What the...
I scream a quick pathetic "EHH!" I hear a slight laugh from someone behind me. How could they find anything funny at a time like this. 

"KID! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!" 
I say with the sound of an all authoritive dad.

The kid screamed back, "WHY!" Like the true teen he was.

I shook my head and waved my hands around frantically gesturing to the giant black hole looking thing opening in my living room roof. 

"WHY'S A GIANT BLACK HOLE OPENING IN MY ROOF!" 
This weird pitched noise starts to form from it, almost like a balloon popping in slow motion I grab my ears. 

The sound continued not deterred by my hands over my ears, I can hear growls and screams this weird beeping noise what sounds like my own voice screaming "WHYS A GIANT BLACK HOLE OPENING IN MY ROOF!" But it sounded like it was being replayed through an old recorder.

A random bout of manic laughter rang through the hole next , followed by another old conversation that sounds like it was being replayed through a old recorder "Who can even tell the difference?" I didn't recognize the voice.

Then I heard someone singing "Jimmy Johns... I got a locket in my POCKET! JIMMY JOHNS!" The voice was deep and gutteral almost gut wrenching, it made my head hurt and ears pop.

Then I heard this sound, like a fully grown whale falling through my floor and BOOM! out came something weird, from the black hole.

I stared confused as the group behind me gasped in unison. 

"What the hell.." I whispered breathy, I didn't even realize I hadn't been breathing that whole time.

The portal, black hole looking thing zipped up shut making a loud 'ZZZZPp' noise as it did so.

I paid it no mind, the thing before me confused me a lot, though.

A man, I think, with two heads and two hands, and little horns on each head. I could see through him and from the heaving breaths behind me I'm guessing they could see the corporal being too.

He had blonde hair on both heads and a pair of dark rimmed glasses covering each eye. He wore very baggy clothes, he looked like an outside street dealer.

At least he probably fit in more than me around here.

"Woah, Jett was right, you are a loser." Said the deep voiced creature in front of me. I could now see the creature has a suit case with it.

"OH, NO, NO." I said exasperated, 
out came the teen as he jumped up and hugged the creature and the thing took him in with welcoming arms.

The group behind me got up from the ground slowly, I didn't hear anymore heaving so something was better about the situation at least.

Then came Amber walking out from the back slowly staring up at the now very weird unfolding situation.

"This is my bud, Johnny John" said the teen all light hearted like he didn't just give someone a panic attack and put a black hole in my living room and then close it, probably taking a years worth of my hearing along with it.

"Great" I say annoyed.
