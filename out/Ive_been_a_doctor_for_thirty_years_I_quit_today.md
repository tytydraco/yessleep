At the very outset, I must apologise. I am not very familiar with this platform, but I talked to my son, and (after a good few hours of refusing to believe me), he thinks I should go on the internet with my story. As a warning.

We didn’t have all these computers when I was young, and word still travelled just fine, but I guess the world has changed.

Up until today, I was a doctor.

A damn good one, if I say so myself. I have the biggest goddamn ENT practice in the next five states, and I’m proud of it. I was, at any rate.

Now, I’ve just lit a cigarette on the final, smouldering chars of my degree. It’s a whole load of bullshit anyway. No man who’s seen anything like I’ve seen would have any faith left in those “authoritative” medical textbooks.

It all began, you see, at exactly half-past ten, when the private line at my upscale Sector V clinic began ringing. If I had been just a little bit luckier and a little less stupid, I would have ignored it, like on any other day. I have strict principles. I don’t take appointments after nine, and I don’t see patients after eleven. It’s how I kept my marriage intact.

You didn’t disrespect my clock. If it was urgent, too bad. If it were an emergency, find someone else. Everyone who worked with me knew that. I was a goddamn superspecialist. I was not going to run around on midnight calls like some junior resident.

That’s why my secretary ignored the line the first time. And the second, and the third, even though the ringing somehow grew louder each time. Then, just as I was planning to call it a night, my chamber intercom clicked and turned green: the line had been patched through.

“Ranjana!” I barked through the door to my chamber, “I’ve told you not to—”

“I didn’t!”  She appeared at the door, nervously tugging at her skirt, eyes wide. “It didn’t even ring this time. I don’t know how it got routed to you!”

“You must have hit the wrong button!”

Even as I said it, I knew it was unlikely. Ranjana had been with me for eight years. She didn’t make mistakes, let alone stupid ones.

“Well, since it’s already here…” I moved to press the button to receive the call, but before I could, the speaker crackled to life of its own accord.

“Dr. Sharma, Dr. Sharma, can you hear me?” The voice was staticky, flickering in and out, like we were not over a landline but on a satellite phone in the middle of a rainstorm. There was so little fidelity that I could hardly tell what the person on the other end sounded like.

“Yes, hello? Hello?” I said the second ‘hello’ a little louder, hoping to cut through whatever strange interference was plaguing the line. I didn’t even know why I was trying so hard to break my own rule. I suppose, even after all these years, I am a professional first.

“Alright, we’re through.” They were talking to someone on their end. Now that the line had cleared up slightly, I could tell it was a man. “Dr. Sharma, I hope I’m not bothering you too much, but we have someone we would like to get checked out. As soon as possible.”

I sighed. As expected.

“Look, mister…”

He didn’t volunteer his name.

“I don’t take appointments at this hour. If you need to come in, call us in the morning, and my secretary will give you a date and a time. I must warn you, we have a backlog.”

“This is an emergency, doctor. It positively cannot wait.”

“Then you should have set an appointment earlier. Call my office tomorrow, please. Good night.” I moved to cut the line.

“It’s very urgent. Are you sure I cannot persuade you?” The voice on the other end was polite, even deferential, but there was a hint of steel behind it that stayed my hand.

“What kind of urgency?” I said, despite myself.

“It’s a… close friend of mine, you see. Nothing life-threatening, but he seems to have completely lost his voice. Perfectly alright otherwise, but he’s completely mute.”

“Mute?” I asked, some forgotten curiosity rising within me. “Do you mean his voice is broken? Hoarse?”

“No, doctor.” There was a sting of triumph in his tune. “He’s completely silent. Not a peep. As if he didn’t have a mouth at all.”

“And nothing else wrong with him?”

“Nothing. Healthy as a horse.”

“Then I see no reason he shouldn’t be able to wait until morning.”

“Ordinarily, you would be right. But there are urgent events he has to attend that require him to be able to speak. We need him seen tonight, and there’s no better doctor in the city than you.”

I rubbed my forehead, raising a quizzical brow at Ranjana. She shrugged helplessly.

I had never broken my rule. On the other hand, the case was…

“Money’s no object, if that’s your concern.” His tone was light and breezy, almost dismissive, as if he couldn’t believe that was even in question.

“Is that so?”

“What’s your consultation fee, Dr. Sharma?”

I opened my mouth to answer, but he cut me off.

“It doesn’t matter. All you need to know is it’s more money than you’ll see in your life for seeing a walk-in patient at a clinic. Significantly more.”

Despite myself, I bristled. How cheap did he think I was?

“It has six zeroes,” he added helpfully, as if reading my mind. “All of that for one single consultation. It shouldn’t take a skilled professional like you more than fifteen minutes. What do you say?”

“Sir…” Ranjana whispered, her tone some mix of warning and trepidation. I silenced her with a knowing look.

She wasn’t wrong. Something in my gut told me I was being paid to see something no one else would. But I told myself it didn’t matter.

Fuck curiosity. Curiosity is for students. I was a professional. I just had to diagnose a mute man and go home with enough money to build a second house in Goa.

“Your friend must be really desperate,” I said, trying not to blurt out my shock.

“We need this solved. With minimum delay. Off the books. Are you in or are you out, doctor?”

Looking back, that is the moment any reasonable man should have walked away. No one gives that much away for, essentially, peanuts. If they are, they are usually buying significantly more than what you think you are selling.

Instead, I looked at the clock.

Ten.

I still had an hour before I had to get home, technically. Before my wife started cribbing.

How long could it take?

“Fine,” I said tersely. “When can your… friend come in?”

I could almost hear the smile in his voice. “Oh, don’t worry about it, Dr. Sharma. My friends are already there.”

Right on cue, I heard the clinic door swing open. The line clicked and went dead on my desk. Ranjana read my glance immediately, rushing out to greet them. There was the sound of heavy boots against hard floor; three or four of them, by my guess. But there was something else, right alongside them. A chill that settled into the room as the door swung closed, prickling up my spine. Out of habit more than anything else, I check the air conditioning. Still at the usual settings.

I rose from my seat, an inexplicable, heavy sense of foreboding coiling around my heart. Telling me I was making a mistake. Telling me to send them away.

I ignored it. The money was too good.

The fucking money.

The first one that caught my eye was the leader of the pack: a man with a browned, metallic complexion, hair slicked back expertly into a part my own grandmother would approve of (may she rest in peace). His suit looked remarkably expensive: the kind that would burn holes even in my pockets, which I supposed explained the willingness to pay. Even as he approached me, his mouth splitting into a perfectly rehearsed smile, the air in the room began to grow pungent with ozone. Like the calm before a thunderclap.

Flanking him on either side, a few steps behind, were two others, one male and one female. Unlike their companion, they were dressed almost too casually: ratty, sagging t-shirts and faded jeans. Their faces were uncovered, but every time I tried to focus on them, my eyes would instantly slide off and onto something else, like slipping on black ice. Even what few details I could glimpse dissolved almost as soon as they entered my mind. All I could comprehend was an ever-shifting mirage, an unsolvable puzzle where their visage should be.

Standing between them was another man; a foreign tourist, by the look of it. He was wearing a faded and stained sky-blue shirt, a silver cross glittering darkly on his collar. His dirty-blonde beard was long and unkempt, matched by the mop on his head. Though he was able to stand by himself, his forehead was slick with sweat, his eyes half-lidded as he tried not to nod off.

“Dr. Sharma.” The man in the suit approached first, wearing a well-rehearsed polite expression as he extended his hand. “Thank you so much for seeing us at such short notice. I want you to know we are all very grateful.”

“You must be—”

“We are the associates your caller mentioned, yes.”

I took his hand. “I thought he said you were friends, mister…”

“Elias.” His grin did not waver, his grip firm as he shook. “You can call me Elias. And yes, he does like to think of us all as friends, doesn’t he? But, just between you and me, I prefer to keep it a little more professional.”

“I see.” Well, no use getting involved in that. Instead, I crossed over to the man they had dragged in. “I assume this is your patient?”

“What gave it away?” Elias chuckled at his own joke, adjusting his suit. “Well, where do you want him, doc? We can wait outside, or take a walk, if that’s what you want.”

After escorting him all the way here, they were just fine with leaving me alone with their ‘friend’? Nevertheless, working would be easier without three people breathing down my neck and asking questions.

“You can step outside if you want,” I said, diplomatically, “but I would appreciate it if we had the room.”

“Understood.” Elias nodded. “People, let’s give the good doctor his space.”

“I’m stepping out. Got to smoke,” the man said.

As an ENT specialist, I hated smoking. As a chain smoker myself, I sympathised perfectly. Besides, I had something else to worry about.

He’s just spoken. No doubt about it. However, even though the sound passed through my ears and I remembered every word he had said, I already had no recollection of what he sounded like. Not a single detail. Not a pitch, not a cadence. Not even the language.

There was a gaping void in my memory where his voice should have been.

“You sure you can handle this, doc?” Elias asked, his eyes slightly narrowed as he read my expression. “You look a little flustered. Long day?”

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, reflexively. Admitting fatigue was a bad idea, commercially and legally, in my profession. “I can take him from here.”

“Can I go?” the man asked again, urgently.

“Go ahead.” Elias gave me another smile. “We’ll be outside, Dr. Sharma. Just in case you need anything.”

Then he walked over to their patient, patting his cheek like an affectionate father. “Don’t worry, kiddo. He’s the best doctor for the next five states. If anyone can fix you up, it’s him.”

A few seconds later, we were alone. Wordlessly, I gestured to my patient to take a seat.

“What’s your name?”

It was more for politeness’ sake than anything else, though it would be nice to know if the muteness was merely psychological.

No answer. Predictable.

“How long have you been in India? You don’t look local. Did you come here on holiday?”

The questions were more to fill the silence than anything else as I rifled around among my tools. I caught Ranjana’s eye through the door. She had taken her seat at her desk. Whatever else, she was ever the professional. Something unspoken passed between us, a language cultivated over the years.

*Keep the equipment running. Just in case.*

They were paying good money. Obscene money. The implication of that was clear.

I had to find an answer. No matter what.

Now that we were alone, I was beginning to notice more details about him. His breaths were coming short and shallow, chest heaving like a pigeon’s, though he didn’t look very distressed by it. His blinking was out of sync, the left eye a few moments late to blink.

And the smell. I had a faint memory of it from my medical school days. A smell I found so disconcerting that it was the single most important factor for me to pick medicine over surgery.

Old, stale blood.

I frowned, mind racing to find explanations even as my hands gathered the necessary equipment. The asynchronous blinking, shortness of breath… Vasovagal response? Nervous issues? Maybe he had tried to take some shoddy drugs at some obscure village music festival? Common enough in Arunachal or Meghalaya, and the tourists always passed through Bengal on the way back. The dealers knew this. But the smell…

A sharp rap on the window.

Both of us jumped at the sound. The man’s eyes followed mine.

A jet-black crow was perched on the windowsill outside, head turned to the side to look straight into the room. Its eyes were big, too big for any bird of its kind I had seen, pupils round and… aware. Intelligence glinted behind them. Almost as if it had been waiting for me to look, it deliberately rapped its beak on the window again, and then again.

I could not understand what it wanted. To come in?

A clatter drew my attention back to my patient. His resigned demeanour had been replaced with a strange, unnatural excitement. His eyes were wide as he stared at the bird, breath coming ragged and fast as he shuffled to get as far away from the window as he could without getting up.

The fear in his eyes was raw, animal. Whatever that thing was, he knew it.

It knew him.

I looked back at it. It met my gaze head-on, its baleful eye growing and growing and growing until it swallowed the whole room. I was a speck of dust before its massive pupil, its glare boring into me.

Cold waves ran through my body. It was scanning. Thinking. Questioning.

And I did not know how to answer it.

Seconds stretched into hours, my muscles petrified before the intensity of this little bird. And then, before I knew it, the moment passed. It cawed once, as any other bird would, spread its wings, and disappeared into the darkness outside.

“Doctor?”

The voice pulled me back to the door, where Elias’s head was sticking through the crack.

“Everything alright? We heard a little commotion.”

“The… the bird…”

“The bird?” Elias did not sound incredulous. Rather, he sounded a little irritated, like he had just been informed of the arrival of an unwelcome guest. “Is… this bird still there?”

“No…” I caught myself before I could get more upset. “Well, never mind. It’s alright. We were just a little startled. I will begin with the examination now.”

Elias gave me a polite smile. “Of course, Dr. Sharma. Once again, if you need anything…”

He left the implication hanging, closing the door behind him.

The man was still wide-eyed, craning his neck to look beyond me. Confirming if we were truly alone. I understood the feeling, but I could not have him fidgeting for the rest of the inspection.

“It’s gone, sir. Please, try to sit still.” I raised the inspection table to the appropriate height. “I’m going to make a physical examination of your throat now, just to see if there is any visible problem. Is that alright?”

He hesitated for a second, and then nodded.

“Okay. Good.” I snapped on my gloves with practised ease.

I first started outside, palpating his neck. There was no obvious inflammation or irregularity. No swelling, no bumps, no excessive throbbing or heat.

In fact, there was little heat at all. His skin was cold, like touching a sheet of metal left in snow overnight. Even the thin sheen of sweat was almost ice-cold, seeping through the gloves and numbing my fingers.

This cold, and still sweating? He did not look uncomfortable, but even so.

The man on the phone had said he was ‘healthy as a horse’. Either he had been grossly misinformed, or he had been lying to my face. That was expected to a certain degree. But this…

I shook my head. Better to concentrate on what I could control. There did not seem to be any external evidence of inflammation, tumours, or infections. Nothing that was serious enough to be noticed through the skin, at any rate. I needed to have a direct look to rule it out fully.

“Open your mouth, please, sir. As wide as you can go.” I grabbed a torch and a tongue depressor from my tray, clearing a visible path.

Despite the harsh light, his pupils remained unmoving, refusing to contract even though he was clearly uncomfortable with the brightness.

“You can close your eyes,” I whispered, concentrating on his throat.

He needed more than an ENT specialist to see him. I was half-tempted to call up a few of my friends for a referral, but I had been asked for discretion. Whether that extended to other medical professionals, I did not know, and I did not want to risk finding out the hard way.

When people were willing to pay that much, it wasn’t just about privacy. Losing the money was the least of your concerns. Disobeying instructions could land you in a ditch. Or worse.

Even under direct inspection, his throat looked perfect. Too perfect. Not a single blemish, aberration, or benign growth. Not even minute scarring from wear. It was… immaculate.

It looked like my patient had walked straight out of the ideal diagram in my anatomy textbook.

No real person’s body looked like that. It was as if he had never spoken, caught a cold, or even coughed too hard in his entire life. How old was he? Above twenty, at least? That was impossible.

I flicked off the torch, trying to keep my confusion from my voice. “You can’t talk? At all?”

The man shook his head.

“What about sounds? Can you sigh? Cough? Shout?”

The man blinked. He hadn’t tried yet.

“Why don’t you go ahead and try to cough for me, then?” I hoped he knew what coughing was, given the pristine condition of his throat.

He nodded and coughed lightly. It sounded normal. No gurgling or scratchiness. That ruled out mucus buildup, though I hadn’t seen any in the first place.

He coughed again, a little harder this time.

“It’s okay, sir, you can stop now,” I said, reaching for my next instrument.

He coughed again, doubling over this time.

“Sir?”

His coughs grew in intensity, until he was shaking and thrashing in place, each retching cough wracking his whole body with spasms.

“Ranjana!” I called out, straightening him up. “Water. Now!”

As he coughed, something black and viscous began to pour out of his mouth, bubbling with intermixed spit and mucus. It came without relief, first in nasty globules and then in a thick stream, staining his shirt and splattering onto the floor.

The smell of blood lingering around him intensified, until I was forced to cover my face with my sleeve to stop myself from gagging. This close, it was joined by others: the raw smell of over-burnt incense, the pungent odour of burning hair, and sickening mildew.

Then, just as suddenly, it stopped. He gasped, taking long, shaky breaths, looking at the tar-like substance now covering the floor and his clothes.

“It’s alright. Happens more often than you’d know,” I lied. “We’ll get it cleaned up.”

He nodded slightly, clearly not believing me.

“Well…” I had to press on, if only to finish up in time and get back home. “Why don’t you drink that water, and then I’ll take a direct look at your larynx?”

Ranjana, true to her usual punctuality, arrived within a few seconds, face fixed in studied disinterest.

She lowered the tray with a glass of water before my patient. He drank in grateful, needy gulps, eyes darting about in some mixture of shame and feat.

We stepped aside, giving him his privacy as best we could.

“What’s that mess, sir?” she whispered under her breath.

“It all came out of him.” I leaned against the wall, crossing my arms and trying to study him without glaring.

“That much?” She looked, wide-eyed, at the floor. “Is it blood?”

“No.” It wasn’t. That smell didn’t come from the sludge. It was coming straight from him, oozing from every pore.

“Then what is it?”

“I have no idea.”

She glanced at me, surprised. It was the first, and now probably last, time she had heard me admit I did not know something.

“We should get a sample of it. It’s contaminated now, but it’ll have to do. This needs to go to a lab as soon as possible,” I said, falling back into the safety of professionalism. “I think we’ll need to see this patient a few more times.”

She nodded. “Yes, sir.”

Even as I looked at it, the thick, gelatinous globules wriggled against the floor, refusing to stay still. As if they were trying to crawl away. As if they were alive.

Yes. I had never seen something like this before. And, the gods help me, I never wanted to see it again.

The man finished his water, looking around for a place to set the glass down. Ranjana took it from him, flashing a measured smile of hospitality.

“Are you ready to continue?” I asked, trying to make my voice as gentle as I could. “We can take a few minutes.”

He shook his head.

“Very well.” I crossed back over to the tray, keeping up the appearance of control. “Now we’re going to take a direct look at your larynx. Your voice box, that is.” I held up my laryngoscope, letting him take a look at it as I got it hooked up to my monitor.

Normally, I didn’t bother. But the more upper-class clients liked the show. The illusion that they knew what was going on.

“I’m going to insert this through your nostril and down your throat. You may feel a little uncomfortable, but it will pass. It has a camera that will allow me to take a direct look at your vocal folds, see if there is anything physical going on.”

When he didn’t protest, I fell back into practised procedural ritualism, administering a light topical anaesthetic before guiding the tube in through his nose. He made a half-hearted attempt to sneeze but stayed otherwise still as I watched the video feed. His nostrils looked normal, with no inflammation or mucus present to signal an infection.

In less than a minute, I was through, reflexes and experience taking over as I deftly entered the throat and proceeded downwards towards my destination. The pharynx passed us by, looking as pristine and perfect as it had visually.

Just a little more, and I would have the vocal folds in sight.

As I rounded the last fold, a crackling sound sent ripples of distortion through the monitor feed. The sound grew, like miniature lightning inside the machine. Then, the feed cut out, replaced by darkness.

I frowned. This machine wasn’t anywhere close to giving out like this. It was less than a year old.

No. The monitor hadn’t turned off. It was still powered. Responsive.

The laryngoscope was transmitting its feed just fine. It was merely looking at nothing. Perhaps just the torch had given out?

Then, the darkness began to shift, vague outlines melting out from the black void. Shifting. Moving.

The vocal folds? No. That looked nothing like a larynx, even from what little I could see.

I fiddled with the controls, trying to get the torch working again.

Unfortunately, it did.

The light flicked on, bathing the patient’s throat once more.

Right before the camera, a black, bulbous mass writhed, tentacle-like projections wrapped tightly around the tissue. It had no features whatsoever, except for the occasional tar-like bubbling sending ripples across its undulating surface.

No features, except a mouth.

A wide grin, human-like teeth jutting straight into the camera.

Its eyeless stare began climbing, back up the fibre-optic. Terrible instinct crawled on my skin like a warning.

It breached the monitor, somehow, looking through something that could not look.

It was looking.

It was looking at me.

With a cry of surprise, I let go of the laryngoscope, staggering back, almost tipping over my chair in the process. It almost slipped out, dragging roughly across the soft tissues of the throat and nose before the man caught its heavy end with a strangled grunt of pain.

I panted, skin flushing with heat and adrenaline. The AC was still humming, but I was sweating like the room had turned tropical. My skin prickled. My shirt clung to my back.

I stared wide-eyed at the monitor. The feed had actually cut out this time, only to flick back on a few moments later.

The camera was looking straight at the man’s larynx. A normal larynx, except that it was too perfect. Too clean. Like everything else in there.

Like something was disguising itself with the ‘healthiest’ image it knew.

“Doctor?” I heard Elias’s voice from outside.

“I’m fine!” I called back, staring at the image. “We’re fine.”

No. Not a single trace remained of anything out of the ordinary. I wiped the sweat off my face, rubbing my eyes. Was it fatigue?

Had I been sleeping too little after all? Maybe bingeing those shows every night wasn’t a good idea after all, no matter what my wife said.

I fixed my patient was the firmest stare I could. “What exactly happened to you? Tell me. Leave no detail out.”

He looked at me helplessly.

I grabbed my pad and a pen from the desk. “Write. I need your history. Can’t make a diagnosis without it.”

He nodded, taking the pen from me. I flipped the pad to a blank page and held it out. He touched the pen to it and scratched the first line.

Then, the pen clattered from his shaking grip, followed shortly by the pad as they landed in the black mess on the floor. He cried out in pain, cradling his hand as the fingers shook and contorted, bending backwards until I was afraid they would tear themselves out of their sockets.

If he hadn’t been so young and (mostly) fine up till now, I would have pegged him with palsy on the spot.

Something nervous, then. It had to be.

It had to be something else. Anything else, other than what I had seen.

“Never mind, then. There is one last test we have to do.” I retrieved the appropriate machine from the tangle in the corner. I would have to have a word with the cleaner about organising that. “An electromyography.”

He gave me a quizzical look. Some things never change.

“It will let me measure electrical activity in your muscles.” I quickly withdrew the laryngoscope, wheeling it away with perhaps a little more urgency than I had to. “I have a suspicion that your problem is related to nerves, since I can see nothing physically wrong.”

Well, that was a lie.

“Your vocal folds may not be getting the correct signals from your brain. Or any signals at all. That might be why you can make sounds, but no complex speech.” I held up a hand to forestall the next question on impulse. “It’s minimally invasive. Don’t worry.”

It wasn’t about the money. Not anymore. I needed to know I was sane.

I showed him the electrodes. “I just need to insert these into your throat externally.”

He sighed, his expression resigned. He did not believe I could help him. To tell the truth, I wasn’t sure either.

But he made no move to refuse, so I continued. This time, I did not administer any anaesthetic. I needed the electrical activity to be as clean as possible. Just in case.

As soon as the monitor flicked on, my questions were both answered and increased. The electromyogram was dead. Completely dead. Not a hint of electrical activity present anywhere.

It was never completely dead. That would mean…

“Can you try to speak?” I asked, just to make sure. “Humour me.”

He strained. Still no activity on the display. I sighed, moving to switch it off. Weird or not, I had my answer.

Then, the graph moved. Within seconds, where there was nothing before, there was now frantic activity. Lines and spikes going everywhere and nowhere, erratic and impossible. Nerves could not carry signals like this. Every hint of medical knowledge I had went against it.

And yet it was happening. A miniature thunder cloud was raging inside my patient’s throat, painting the monitor with hints of its power.

The lights in the clinic flickered, as if the electricity was overwhelming the circuitry, travelling back through the computer and into the room around me. I rose from my chair, opening my mouth to say something.

With one final, blinding flash, every light in the room detonated, sending sprays of glass everywhere. I ducked, covering my head with my arms as small shards pattered against my clothes. In an instant, we were cast into blinding darkness, the ghostly glow of the electromyogram the only source of any illumination.

Someone banged on the door, trying to open it. It did not budge. In the darkness, I felt something moving along it. Something heavy, holding it in place with its bulk.

The monitor continued flickering, casting dancing shadows that shrouded more than they revealed. I looked at it again, despite every instinct screaming not to.

“That’s not…” I murmured. “That’s not how it works. Neural impulses don’t transmit—"

The spikes were converging, melting into each other. Forming something coherent.

Forming words, scrawled across the screen with impossible physics.

THE. PRICE. IS. PAID.

LEAVE. IT. ALONE.

HE. IS. MINE.

I wanted to look away. Everything in me screamed not to, my legs begged to run, but I stared, transfixed, like a lab rat watching its own autopsy.

Then, the letters were melting, crashing into each other, twisting and rolling.

Stretching into a smile. A ghostly, terrible smile, drawn in impulses.

A sharp crack split the air. It came from my patient.

Something was dragging its way out of his mouth, jaw breaking out of its hinges as it was stretched impossibly wide. His eyes lolled back into the back of his skull, the cornea glowing with an eerie light as his tormentor revealed himself. Its long, serpentine body uncoiled, black and slippery, growing in girth every second as it dragged itself along the floor, along the walls, along the ceiling.

Surrounding.

Suffocating. Drawing ever closer.

Then, it was facing me. The head of the beast smiled, its body pulsing everywhere around me. I was in a room made of it, any hint of my clinic long since gone.

Its mouth split into a grin. Then, it opened, and the thing spoke.

Its voice was deep, gravelly, sending tremors of weakness through my legs.

“You are wasting your time, doctor. He has sinned, and he has atoned. There is nothing for you to heal. It is late. Go home. Be with your family.”

The threat was clear.

Before it decided I couldn’t.

With a crash, the door burst open. Quicker than I could blink, the monster withdrew, like a rubber band snapping back into place as it crawled back into its host. His jaw snapped back into place just as torchlight from the doorway blinded me.

Elias and his companions shone their torches into the room, flicking from me to the patient and then back again. Beyond them, the lights of the waiting area glowed with their usual pleasant, dim light.

“Are you alright? Sir? Sir!” Ranjana pushed past them, stepping gingerly over the glass on the ground as she hurried to me. “What the hell happened here?”

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t, my voice betraying me as I slumped into the nearest chair, shying away from the probing light of the torches.

“Dr. Sharma?”  Elias frowned. “Are you injured?”

I managed to shake my head.

“And your patient?”

I looked up as the torch flickered on his face. He did not look afraid. No, we were far beyond that. He was numb, catatonic, eyes as wide as they could go as he stared out into nothing.

Barely breathing.

But he was alive.

Elias hummed in approval. “Well?”

“Well?” I said slowly.

“What’s your diagnosis, Dr. Sharma? Or did you forget what we were here for?”

I buried my face in my hands. “After everything that just happened… That is your first question?”

“Well, you look fine,” the woman said, crossing her arms.

Of course. I took a shaky breath. “I… there was… There’s something inside him. I can’t… I can’t solve this. It threatened me. It came out of his mouth, and it threatened me. It knew me. It knew everything. It said… he had sinned, and he had to atone. It was… Gods, it was…” I looked up, no longer able to hide my vitriol. “There’s a monster. A monster. That’s my diagnosis, sir. Your patient has, or is, a monster.”

Ranjana’s expression was openly terrified now, even as she used her handkerchief to wipe the perspiration from my brow as well as she could.

“A monster,” Elias repeated, his expression neutral.

“A monster,” I snapped, no longer caring.

I didn’t want the money. I wanted… I didn’t even know what I wanted.

This wasn’t science. Or medicine. It was mythology. It was madness.

I just wanted… needed to get out of here.

“Well, that makes sense.”

“What?” I jolted, unable to keep the surprise from my voice.

Elias sighed, flashing me another one of his easy smiles. In the light from his torch, he looked ghostly. Foreboding. “I’m afraid we haven’t been entirely truthful with you, Dr. Sharma. This appointment… it was more of a second opinion. We needed to be sure. Absolutely sure that it wasn’t simply medical. We needed you to make sure.”

“You… knew…?”

“We have had an experience with the pathology, yes,” he said evasively. “And now, we know that the… entity you saw is to blame. Thanks to you.”

“You put my life in danger, without telling me anything, so you could ‘make sure’?” I said, bile and anger rising together up my throat with every recollection of that smiling electromyogram.

“Well, you are a smart man, Dr. Sharma. Surely you didn’t think we would be paying you that much simply to stick a camera in someone’s nose?”  Elias chuckled. “Besides, we were sure, reasonably sure, that it would not harm you. Not unless you kept pushing. You, wisely, did not.”

I opened my mouth and then closed it again.

“Well, our business here is concluded, Dr. Sharma. And look at that!” Elias pointed a finger at the clock in the lobby. “Right on schedule!”

Eleven. On the dot.

The bastard knew. He knew when I went home.

They had been watching me. Scouting me.

“You…”

“Your wife,” Elias interrupted, his grin growing a little sharper, “would be distraught if you tarried any further, doctor, as would be your beautiful children. And there is little that causes more delay in getting home than asking the wrong questions. Some of those delays could even be permanent.”

I glared at him. But my mouth snapped shut.

I believed him.

“Leave your office unlocked, and the key on your desk.” He resumed his easy-going tone. “Our cleanup crew will be along shortly. Nothing leaves this room, doctor. Not material, and not words. Understood?”

I nodded.

“Then we have no quarrel.” Elias bowed to me before turning to his soldiers. “Pick our preacher up, will you? We’re leaving.”

As his men slid into motion, the lights flickered again and went out. For a second or two, we were in absolute darkness. When they came back on, the men were gone, as was my patient.

It was as if we had been alone all this time, except for the mess they had made of my clinic.

The only lingering sign of their existence was a nondescript black briefcase, placed deliberately on Ranjana’s desk.

“Sir?” she whispered. This close, I could feel her shaking in fear.

“Go home, Ranjana,” I breathed, struggling to my feet, the aftereffects of adrenaline making my breathing choppy. My heart thundered like a struggling petrol engine in my chest.

I was getting old. Too old for this. I saw that now, all at once.

“Sir, I…”

“Go home,” I repeated. “Go home and go to sleep. Forget this ever happened. And for the gods’ sake… tell no one.”

Without waiting for her to comply, I stumbled over to the briefcase, marshalling every ounce of willpower to prevent my legs from collapsing like jelly.

The locks were keyed to 000. Unlocked. The clasps snapped open as soon as I touched them. Beneath the smooth lid were neatly tied bundles of rupee notes, two thousand each, stacked to fill the entire space inside.

I could estimate at a glance. There was enough to fulfil the promise. Maybe more.

On top of the pile, there was a business card, blank except for a phrase in neat handwriting.

*Do not pursue this.*

After that, it was all a blur. The next thing I knew, I was closing my car door, walking up the stairs to my house. I dreamt up some answers for my wife somewhere along the way, though it was difficult to explain the briefcase in my white-knuckled grip. Even now, I can see it. In the corner.

Waiting.

Trust me, I’m going to use the money. I’m not that stupid.

But as for the rest of it, I’m done.

Done believing in the lies we stretch over the mouth of the world and call truth, because it’s convenient.

Everything we think we know is a veil. I understand that today.

And what’s on the other side? I don’t care to know. I don’t want to know.

But I do know this.

I’m going to burn every medical textbook I have tonight. Maybe have a little bonfire too, while I’m at it. If you’re a doctor, I encourage you to do the same.

Why? Because that thing I saw in the room is the truth. The only truth of our world.

Everything else?

Lies.

Elegant lies. Well-dressed lies. Authoritative lies.

But lies.

It’s all [lies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/)
