I was 13 when we moved to Ashfield. In the summer of ’97, the bulls won their back-to-back championship, Oasis released their third album, and I thought girls were stupid. I still remember the smell of beer and sausages entering my room through the window. Mom was a big fan of inviting the neighbors for a grill party every Sunday, honestly I hated it. She forced me to play with the neighbors’ children to “socialize “. They were weird. We did not share one common thing. I wore Jordans, they wore church shoes.

 

 I had one good pal, his name was Jimmy. We were the troublemakers of Ashfield. Why am I telling you all of this? For a specific reason, Jimmy found something in my garden that would change my whole life. What he found taught me a valuable lesson. Even dark desires want to be fulfilled.

My mom called me to help her to set up the wooden table we had that stood in our garden.

“Mike, stop listening to his rap music crap of yours and help your mother.”

I rolled my eyes, luckily she did not see that or she would have spanked me so hard I would not have been able to sit for 3 days. I loved my mom, but she was tough. It was not easy for her, raising me alone after my dad died in a car crash.

 

I entered the garden, wearing baggy shorts and my bulls jersey, she wore her favorite summer dress.

“Mike, I told you many times to stop looking like a thug. Why can’t you dress normally like the other children?”

“The other children are boring.” I went to the kitchen, I grabbed the plates, forks and knives. When I went back to the garden I saw, mom was talking to our Neighbor Mr. Jenkins. I hated his guts, he always smelled cheap after shave and cigarettes. He always flirted with mom, and she did it back. One day I can remember hearing strange sounds from Mom’s bedroom. Jimmy said they had probably sex, I did not believe it.

“Hey Champ, how are you today?”

“Good.”

My mom slapped the back of my head. She wanted me to be nicer to our neighbor. I did not care.

I never understood why he always called me champ, only my dad called me like this. Maybe this was one of the reasons I hated him so deeply. 

I thought my day was ruined but then I heard Jimmy shouting from the other side of our fence.

“Yo, my mom allowed me to take Rex to your party.” Rex was his German shepherd, the best dog in the world. I opened the door for him. We dapped each other up, and I patted Rex.

“Mom, can we and Jimmy go to my room and listen to music?”

“Sure my dear but the dog will not enter the house.”

 

As we entered my room, he pulled something out of his pockets.

“I stole the cigs of my dad, lets try them. They must be good when all the adults are smoking them.”

“I don’t know, my mom is gonna kill me when she finds out I smoked.”

“Come on, don’t be a pussy. Even the lover of your mom is smoking cigs.”

I pushed him hard, “He is not the lover of my mom, dickhead.”

“Whatever, let's smoke one.” He lit the cigarette, he tried it first. I can only remember how bad they tasted. Me and him were probably coughing for five minutes after that. I never touched a cigarette after that. I knew I did something wrong, but the feeling of doing something forbidden was fun. The little rush we got doing stupid things only we knew about made It worth it. We opened the window and sprayed some cologne in my room to hide the smell of the cigs, in hindsight very stupid because every adult would still smell them immediately but we were kids.

Rex was barking at something in my garden and it bothered the early guests that arrived. My told Jimmy to come down and to calm down his dog or bring Rex back to his home. We both rushed down, to see what was going on with Rex. He was in the back of the garden, barking at the ground. As we arrived he started to dig a hole. I panicked because my mom would have definitely killed me if she would have seen that.

“Tell Rex to stop or I am going to die.”

“Calm down, let me handle this.” Jimmy always had this calm attitude when things went wrong and I admired him for that but in this moment he pissed me off. First the cigs and now the hole, I felt like he really wanted me to be in trouble. Jimmy calmed down Rex but he was suspiciously quiet. Normally, Jimmy never shuts up. He called me over. I saw a small hole and between the mud and dirt was a little black box, nothing was special about it.

“Why is there a black box buried in your garden?”

“I don’t know, maybe the previous owner buried it.”

“We need to see what’s in there.”

I took the box and tried to open it, but my spaghetti arms were too weak.

“You need a key, dickhead.” was Jimmy’s smart ass response.

I went to my mom with the box, I thought maybe she knew something about it. She was talking to Jenkins, both were really drunk and very touchy. It made me sick to my stomach, I saw a knife laying on the table. My first instinct was to drop the box, grab the knife and cut Jenkins open like a pig.

 

But before I could finish my murderous fantasy, someone grabbed me by my arm and dragged me into the living room. It was Rebecca, but I always called her Becky.

“What do you want from me, Becky?”

“Nothing, but you looked like you wanted to kill someone so I got curious.”

“None of your business.”

She pointed at the black box that I was still holding in my hands. Becky was like every other girl, simply annoying.

“Again, it’s none of your business. Go to the other girls and play with some Barbies or something.” I always played it cool around girls, Jimmy told me that's what they really like. She came close to me, I could feel her breath. I thought she would kiss me so I closed my eyes. She whispered in my ear.

“Everyone in Ashfield knows your mom is fucking Jenkins.”

I got taught to never punch a girl, mom told me this. It was weird because I saw my dad sometimes slapping my mom but I respected it. At this moment I did not care if she was a girl, I wanted to smash her head in with the box. I opened my eyes but she was gone already.



Later in the evening, I was laying down in my bed, reading some comics. Jimmy left long ago and only a few people were left at the party. I could not sleep, it was hard to sleep when people were talking loudly and listening to this disgusting country music.

I was thirsty, so I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. When I went past my moms bedroom, I could hear some noises. I opened the door but only a little to get a peak. I saw Jenkins fat back and he was on top of my mom.

“You like when i fuck you like this you dirty whore.”

“ I bet i fuck you better than your husband.”

My whole body was shaking, Jimmy was right. She was really having sex with Jenkins. Tears formed in my eyes from anger. I stormed into my room. The black box was standing on my desk, looking at me. It was weird, the box was closed the whole day but when I entered my room it was open. I went to the box to see what was inside. It was a picture, a picture of a corpse. A woman's body lying in a bed, she was naked.  I turned the picture around and with red letters it was written.

“Kill her.”

I put the picture back into the box, I thought it was one of Jimmy’s pranks. I laid on my bed but what I saw in my mom’s bedroom did not leave my mind. I cried my eyes out from anger, I wish she and Jenkins would die. I could not take it. I took my backpack and I wanted to run away, I did not know where to go. I simply wanted to leave.

 

Again, the box looked at me, I decided to look at the picture for the last time. I recognized something in the picture, the blankets and pillows next to the corpse looked like the one mom had. It clicked for me, the picture told me to kill my mom. I started to shake from anxiety, my head was spinning. I wanted to vomit, but then I remembered what I saw.

 

I went to the kitchen, to get the biggest knife possible. I had the picture on my pockets, I was still unsure but everytime i started to doubt, I remember Jenkins fat back moving up and down. I went back to the bedroom of my mom. Slow and quiet steps, I prayed that Jenkins was still there so I could kill him too. Again I slowly opened the door, he was not there but mom was sleeping. With every step I took closer to my mom, my determination to kill her grew, it was growing witch each step.

 

I stood next to her, I carefully removed the blanket, she was laying there naked. Her Breasts fully exposed. I could smell his cheap aftershave on her. I started to stab her, I was in a trance. She screamed but out of reflex I stabbed her in the throat and then she sounded like she was drowing. I stabbed her till my arms gave out. My upper body was covered in her blood. She was a bloody mess. I took the picture out of my pocket, she looked exactly like the woman in the picture. She was the woman in the picture.

 

I felt relieved, I did not even process what I did. I cleaned myself up, and went to Jenkins House. I broke into it, and I entered his bedroom. I did not kill him, I placed the knife in his hands and went back home. I called the police, and Jenkins got arrested.

 

That all was 28 Years ago, Jenkins is still in prison. From time to time I look at the picture. After I killed my mom, the red letters disappeared. There was a new message on the back.

“Good job, Champ.”
