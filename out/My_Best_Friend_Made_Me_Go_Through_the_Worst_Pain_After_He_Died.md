Cluster Headaches, they call them the worst pain a human can experience. A deep, stabbing agony behind a single eye, a pain scale 9.7 out of 10, the kind that drops grown adults to their knees and makes them pace in circles like wounded animals. That’s what they say the worst pain is. They’re wrong.



The worst pain in the world isn’t physical. It’s losing your best friend—and then having that same best friend make you suffer after he’s already dead.



They tell me I have schizophrenia. “Hallucinations. Trauma response.” My therapist says it like he’s reading symptoms off a checklist. He told me writing everything down might help. So that’s what I’m doing. I’m sorry if this feels disjointed. I don’t have the energy to write it all in one sitting. Even thinking about it makes my head throb.



I met my best friend in the late ’90s. I think it was the summer of ’98. I can’t be bothered to remember exactly. We were seven or eight, two bored kids dragged out to a campground in the middle of British Columbia.



We met at the swimming hole. The water was a dark, murky green. My dad sat on the small, rocky beach, cracking open a beer like he always did. I remember the hiss of the can, the way he squinted at the water, the smell of sunscreen warming on my skin. I was waiting for it to dry so I could swim without getting yelled at. I had been in the water for maybe ten minutes when I saw him—another kid walking toward the swimming hole, barefoot, smiling like he already knew me.



“Hi! I’m Jackson. Want to play Marco Polo?”



That was it. That one sentence. Jackson became my best friend. Our dads hit it off too. Beer tends to make friendships fast. They’d sit together in the evenings, laughing, bottles clinking, while me and Jackson ran around the campsite like wild animals.



If only things had stayed that simple.



The day before his 26th birthday, he was murdered. They found his body mutilated on what should’ve been his birthday. The birthday where he told me he planned to propose to his girlfriend of ten years. He told me the week before that if he ever died, I needed to play a voice message he sent me for her. He told me not to listen to it unless he died. He handed me the ring and asked me to give it to him at the end of the party so he could propose.



I did what he asked. I played the voice message for her and gave her the ring.



She cried. She sobbed until she couldn’t sob anymore. Her voice was raw when she choked out:



“Why did he want you to do this?”



I stood there for a good thirty seconds before I managed, “...because he loved you too much to express it in front of you.”



Saying that was a mistake. She collapsed into screaming sobs until her throat literally bled.



I left not long after. She went to the ER, but I honestly forgot what happened after that. I went home and made some food—pretty sure I just microwaved leftover pizza or something. After that I threw on some shitty Adam Sandler rom-com. I fell asleep watching it. Netflix must’ve autoplayed, because I woke up to a horror movie.



I was about to go back to sleep when I heard something from the living room. A notification from my phone. I must’ve left it out there when I went to my room.



I went to check it.



It was a text from Jackson’s number.



It was a video.



When I pressed play, I started crying. It was someone swimming in a swimming hole. The water looked the same murky green it did that summer in ’98. The video was taken from the trees. Then I heard someone say something. It was subtle, but I knew what it said.



“Hi! I’m Jackson. Want to play Marco Polo?”



At first I thought it was Jackson’s dad recording it—until the camera panned to the beach.



And then I saw Jackson’s dad sit beside my dad and crack open a beer.



That wasn’t Jackson’s dad.

And whoever took this video had been stalking us for over seventeen fucking years.



I’m tired. I’ll tell you more later. I’m too fucking tired right now.
