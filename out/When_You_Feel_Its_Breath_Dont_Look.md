There was only one rule in this town: *when you feel it's breath, don't look* a rule that had been there since the very beginning of time and a rule I had followed effortlessly my entire life. Every night, when the clock struck midnight, everyone could feel the breath, *there*, at the back of their neck. 


Nobody knew where the rule came from, it was always spoken in hushed tones and frightened whispers, especially from the elders of in this town. I used to think that this was only just a fabricated story created to scare sense into absentminded children-- until the first time I *felt* it. 


That cold, steady exhale that brushed against the back of my neck, rising every hair on my skin and washing over me with a dread I could never shake off. It was never visible, but it was undeniablely real, like a cold drawling blanket being wrapped around everyone who dared seek solitude inside this town. 



And those who dared look towards the cold, but heated breath pushing against the back of their neck, they'd *never* be seen again. People had just-- disappeared, or they were still there... *But not entirely there.* There eyes that had previously been filled with life became hollow, dark-- a glaze covering their eyes, a blankness that just stayed inside their eyes, an emptiness that had swallowed up the light. 



Perhaps that was why me, alongside many other townsfolk, *never* looked. Who was I to know that *tonight* would be different. 


Me and my friend, Sarah had spent hours inside my living room. Sitting on the couch next to eachother, laughing and reminiscing over old memories and just talking for hours on end. And for the first time in a while, I felt the warmth her company provided and not the coldness that the breath provided. 


“Remember when we tried to prank your older brother?” she asked with a grin. “You put shaving cream in his shoes and we ran off, only for him to catch us and chase us around the yard for an hour?”

I laughed, my mind instantly going back to that day. “I swear, he was more mad about the mess than the prank. He didn’t stop complaining about the shaving cream for weeks. He even found some in his socks the next morning.”

She chuckled, shaking her head. “That was the best. Honestly, I think you got more creative with each prank you pulled. I was the brains, but you were the one who took it too far.”

I rolled my eyes, nudging her playfully. “You always act like I was the mastermind. You were right there with me, laughing the whole time.”

She grinned, giving me a knowing look. “Yeah, maybe. But you *did* put the shaving cream in his shoes.” 


I laughed, shaking my head from side to side. "Hey, at least I didn't end up exploding my oven when trying to make my own pizza." 


Sarah stared at me for a few moments, scoffing loudly. "You know, at least I *tried* there's nothing wrong with taking a little risk."

I laughed again, but something about the conversation started to shift. A slight tension hung in the air, a tension I couldn’t ignore. I had been trying to shake off the weight in my chest, the tightening of my nerves as the clock ticked toward midnight, but it was impossible to ignore now. The air around us was heavy, cold, almost suffocating.

I glanced at the clock on the wall. Eleven fifty-eight.

I could feel it—the breath. That cold presence, waiting just behind me, just like it always did. I felt my skin prickle. My heart began to race. It was coming.

I tried to focus on Sarah’s face, tried to keep my mind on our conversation, but it was no use. The moment was drawing near, and the dread I felt was almost overwhelming. My hand clenched into a fist at my side, and my body tensed.

Sarah was still talking, oblivious to the change in the air. She was animated, her face alive with excitement from our memories, but my thoughts were elsewhere. Every second that passed, the tension grew.


"Alex. You know you don't need to focus on *it.*" Sarah's words cut through the panic rising inside my chest.


Somehow, I could feel it starting to fade away. *For the first time in forever.* "I know, but it's hard not to. I mean, have *you* ever been able to ignore it?" I replied, although my voice was soft, not the usual fear that entered my voice when it was close to midnight. 


She stared at me for a moment, before she let out a small sigh, nodding slowly. "Only recently." She replied, a nonchalantness inside her voice. 


I could feel my face slackening for a moment, my jaw almost dropping to the floor but I got a hold of myself. At least the company kept me distracted. I felt comfortable, not *scared.* "How?" I immediately questioned, a curiosity flooding throughout me. 


*And then the clock struck twelve.* 


I froze. My body went rigid as I could feel, that recognisable coldness stringing inside the air. It enveloped around me, it's cold arms a heavy, unshakeable pressure all around me. But even as I could feel each tremor of the freezing breath cascading upon my neck, I never once drowned in the fear that usually wracked throughout me. I focused on the one thing that grounded me, that made me feel comfortable. *Sarah.* 



"I got used to it. I mean if you *don't* look, what's the point in being scared by it?" Sarah said after a few moments, shrugging her shoulders lightly. 


I paused for a few moments, only to mull over her words inside my head. As I did, I too could feel the breath on my neck starting to numb, because I simply started to *ignore* it. "Yeah. Your right." 


At my words, Sarah let out a soft laugh, standing up from her place on the couch. I watched as she walked over towards the window, her glittering eyes looking out into the moonlit, peaceful street. 


And then, what she said seemed to change everything. 


"Alex," she started, her voice barely above a whisper. "What if we just looked? What if we just... Broke the rule?" 


I could feel the panic threatening to bubble inside of me, the breath against my neck starting to feel more immense-- heavier, but somehow I pushed it down. I focused on the one thing that was *real.* Sarah. 


"We can't, Sarah. We know what happens when you *look.*" I replied to her immediately, my voice growing stern. 


She only seemed to scoff, her gaze still fixated on the window. "I know, but that's just the thing, isn't it? It's *always* going to be there. So what's the point in shutting it out?" 



At her words, I could feel my heart start to sink. A gnawing feeling inside my chest, constricting, as if something was burning a large, gaping hole through my entire body. 


"Don't be stupid, Sarah." I started to speak, the rising panic I previously felt clear inside my voice. "Whatever you do, don't look. Please, just don't look--" 


But, she didn't listen. She never did, she was just like the child that she always was. Curious. And I couldn't do anything as I watched-- eyes widening with horror, as she turned to look over her shoulder. 



*And then, her eyes landed on me.* 


In that moment, everything seemed to slow. Slow, as I watched her eyes dialate with pure horror-- widen, the light inside her eyes extinguishing in a flash. She stood, *frozen* in place-- staring...




At me.




*Not at the breath, not behind me. At ***me.*** And in that moment, the truth wracked throughout me as agonising as the first time I felt the breath.*



***The rule that had always been inside this town, was a rule that had always been about me. That breath, had always been...***



***Mine.***


*And perhaps... This is a warning to you.* 


***When you feel my breath, don't look.***
