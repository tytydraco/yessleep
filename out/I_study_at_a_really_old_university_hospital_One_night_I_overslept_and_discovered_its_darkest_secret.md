It's dark and raining outside. I'm typing all this inside a car, hoping that nobody will notice me. Praying that this is a safe hiding spot at least for this moment, at least until I let everything that happened off my chest. I need at least one other person to know before it's too late.

To give you a backgrounder, I'm a 2nd year med school student at possibly my country's oldest university, definitely one of the oldest universities in Asia. I won't give  any names to protect the innocent. But it goes without saying that my campus is haunted. Forget the prestige, or the fact that literal national heroes studied in this university. Mention its name to anyone in the country and they'll ask if you've ever seen a ghost.

I prided myself as a woman of science. I've had countless night classes and 8pm dismissals even in pre-med. I never saw a ghost, not once. What I did see, however, is something worse. Something no one should ever see or have to go through. It shouldn't have to exist, period. Even if an evil few disagree and say that it's for the greater good.

So I went on with my life, made friends and had a few boyfriends, loved some teachers and hated a few, and dreamed of becoming a successful orthopedic doctor in the near future (although my parents wanted me to take pediatrics or obstetrics instead). Med school was a ton of pressure and highly competitive, with fewer and fewer students returning each term, but what was new? Except for that one night class when we all entered the lecture hall to find an unfamiliar prof waiting for us on the platform.

I'll never forget the look on his face -- unnaturally pale and pasty, a smile as wide and forced as a clown's. "Mr. Romero is undergoing investigation by the university's authorities," he explained between his teeth, still smiling. "In the meantime, I'll handle this class." My friends and I glanced at each other, a little unnerved but at this point we just wanted to get it over with and return to our dorms. In particular, I was so exhausted that I didn't get to recite much that day. I was also pretty bummed because I liked Mr. Romero and his way of teaching. Even if he had a tendency to question the university's archaic religious policies. Or its current stances on politics. Or the ongoing corruption within the admin. 

In lectures, Mr. Romero had the tendency to go off-topic. Whenever he caught himself, he always said the same thing: "Everything is connected." Then he'd go back to his lecture on nerves and tissues.

Still, as upset as some of were with the substitute arrangement, we weren't really surprised about it. We just hoped that Mr. Romero wouldn't get fired. Other professors who "asked too much" ended up getting called by the admin. A few students were victims of this as well, and they'd never show up to class or lab again, presumably expelled.

And so for the longest time, I thought I wouldn't see Mr. Romero again. Until tonight.

My friends and I were on our way back to our dorms after class when I realized that I had left my canvas bag under the desk at the lecture hall. "You can get it tomorrow, Rafaella," my dorm mate Olive said. "Besides, it's been raining hard lately. You don't want to get caught in the rain."  I considered for a moment; it was typhoon season after all.

We had just passed by the Main Building of our campus, which was just a road away from the med building. A little lore on this building: It's really old, it has gargoyles and statues carved on the roofs and walls, and for some reason -- no one know why -- its top floor is sealed off to the public. No classes are held there. All stairs leading to that floor are blocked off. Even the elevators don't have a "4" button to prevent people from going there. Just floors 1 to 3.

"We're not yet far off, " I told my friends. "I'll catch up. You guys go ahead." Thunder rumbled and brought with it fine droplets of rain. I groaned. I really wanted to get my canvas bag because my umbrella was in there, and I didn't want to waste my money on another umbrella that would get lost, forgotten or stolen again in the future. Also, it was almost 9 and the janitors would be cleaning the lecture halls anytime soon.

"I'll follow you," Nathan said. Olive smiled knowingly and the others began teasing him. Even though I knew Nathan had a crush on me, I saw him as nothing more than a friend. I hurried to med school building before he could follow and before the rain worsened.

By the time I found my canvas bag, the building was almost empty and the lights of other classrooms in the hallway were going off one by one. The last classes were getting dismissed. The rain outside worsened as well, all of a sudden, sending torrents of downpour that I knew would flood the lower-lying levels of the campus. I groaned, realizing that I had chosen the worst pair of black flats to navigate that possible situation, but it had been sunny in the morning.

"Never mind," I thought to myself, settling on my seat in the lecture hall. It was so eerie to be alone but I didn't believe in ghosts and I knew that it would be much worse outside. Maybe I could use a bit of rest. I yawned and folded my arms on the table and slept, setting my alarm to 20 minutes.

I didn't know then that I was being watched. That there were footsteps from the hallway and that the whispers I soon heard came from people who had just entered the room. For all I knew, these were just part of a dream. 

Then the alarm sounded and I woke up to a dark room that smelled like rotten meat...or worse. I've handled cadavers in med school. I thought I was used to smell of death. But this wasn't just death, it smelled like something or someone was actively dying, decaying. And in the darkness all around me were cries and moans of pain. 

I scrambled to my feet. 

I tried to stay calm. I knew that I was no longer in the lecture room. For some reason, I was still holding my phone. I turned on my flashlight and saw myself in a dark hallway. One wall was made up of windows half-hidden by thick railing. I peered outside and had to blink twice. I wondered if I was still dreaming. The windows overlooked four stories below, to a courtyard garden....that of the Main Building.

Then I heard rattling. Three knocks coming from a door. A rescue?

Deep voices. Including the substitute's. "If it works, at the very least, some part of her will be here."

Another voice...a female. Someone I couldn't recognize. "And if it doesn't?"

"Then she'll end up like Romero."

Footsteps and flashlights, lines of light that fell upon walls and revealed horrors that almost made me scream out loud, but that would give me away, I hid behind an empty bookshelf, hoping to blend in the shadows as the two "teachers" inspected the room. But not before I captured evidence against them.

Shielding me from view on the other side was a torso.

Yes, a torso. The rest of the body blended in the wall.

As the flashlights danced around the hallway, I caught more body parts. An arm jutting out of the floor, a hand swaying in painful, jerking motions. Legs and feet with missing toes embedded between the wall and floor. Shapes of faces under the paint, their experessions filled with agony. Still with my phone in hand, I hid behind the half-bodies and other obstacles -- a chair here and there, other bookshelves, some nearly-broken tables -- and followed closely behind as the two paced the room. Trust me, I caught everything on video. The body parts still jerking and moving, attached to the ceiling, walls, floor. The sounds of eternal torture, people forever stuck between life and death. And then, snippets of answers. My substitute professor and his colleague were apparently using the bodies of "subversives" and patients who had no family to miss them as test subjects for experiments on teleportation.

"But I can't tell if this new arm over here is hers."

"It's her skin tone."

"Something tells me it's not her."

"If it's not her, we've succeeded at last."

I stayed long enough until I saw what I needed to see. I used the flash in my cellphone camera, knowing fully well that I was finally blowing my cover. But that was Mr. Romero's head sticking out of the wall, offering me a small, sad smile and a word of advice that I was going to take regardless.

"RUN!"

I dashed down the hallway. The professors, more familiar with the terrain, sprinted after me. Or, tried to. Some of the arms yanked their feet and they had to struggle to break free. The man broke free first, but tripped over another leg while another half-body jutting from the nearby wall reached out to pull his hair until he fell backwards.

Meanwhile, I was getting closer and closer to the door, wondering how on Earth I was getting out of the building if every entry point to the 4th floor was sealed off. Turns out I didn't have to worry.

I opened the door and in the blink of an eye, I was at the lobby of my dorm. Nobody else was there. It was late but the lights were still on, and in a moment, the security guard came out and greeted me with a smile.

"It's quite late, Rafaella. But you're dry, thank god. I'm glad you didn't get caught in the rain." 

Thunder rumbled outside. The wind and rain howled. I ran up to my room, charged my phone, and checked if everything was there.

Nothing but ten minutes of blank, mute nothingness. And the picture I took of Mr. Romero? One long black rectangle that didn't show anything even when I changed its brightness in an app.

I knew I couldn't go back to school.

I closed my eyes and when I opened then in a second, I found myself in my car, which was in the parking lot across the hospital.

Their experiment on teleportation worked for the very first time, it seemed, with me. I am slowly learning to navigate this power. All I had to do was close my mind and will myself to be in a different place. I must admit that it was an amazing power to have, something I could also use in bringing the truth to light.

But at what cost?

At what cost?
