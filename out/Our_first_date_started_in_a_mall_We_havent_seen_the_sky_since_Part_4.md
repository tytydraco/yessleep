“What if we just live here?” 

Rav asked one day as we were towelling off. We had just finished showering in one of the mall’s many bizarre fountains—this one had a marble statue of the Greek mathematician Euclid. He was holding an abacus which sprayed [water](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ke1l3i/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_havent_seen/).

“Live here? In the **infinite mall**? Are you joking?”

“I know it's not ideal,” Rav dried his beard, he hadn’t shaved since we got stuck. “But so far it's been able to supply everything we need. Food, clothes, water.”

“Rav, no. I can’t even picture it as a joke. Living here would be awful.”

“It’s just a hypothetical question. Would it be so awful?”

I changed into my cargo pants and flannel. We often brought up philosophical debates, it was a nice way to make it feel like we were still in school. But I couldn’t abide by this one.

“Even as a hypothetical, it's a no. I miss living on Earth. I want people to be around me again. Family, friends, anyone. I want normalcy.”

“For sure, for sure, and I would obviously *rather* have that. But you can at least still have *some* of things via the internet.” He pointed to the iPad on our backpacks.

He wasn't wrong. Despite being trapped in this bizarre dimension, our cell phones still had service. I could still message my parents and even my friends. I could even technically be taking online courses right now.

“Maybe if we accepted that we’re sort of *castaways* inside this infinite mall—” Rav put on his hiking pants and shirt, “—we could relax our constant need to move. And just focus on… you know, ourselves.”

“Rav.” I grabbed an elastic band and used it as a scrunchie, collecting the hair away from my face. “I’ll focus on myself, once we find a way out of here. I’m not spending the rest of my life trapped in this mall. That’s ridiculous.”

I pointed at Euclid’s marble, dour-looking face.

“I am *not* getting used to this.”

\*\*\*

But that conversation stuck with me. 

Weeks passed. Rav and I explored the dark hallways of the ever-expanding *City Center Mall* and kept finding more of the usual fare: food courts, clothing stores, nail salons, art shops, toy stores…

Some of the mall plazas were nicer than others. Some had indoor gardens full of flowers. One even featured a small pool across from a martini bar.

*Would it be that bad if we settled down in one of these places? For A week or longer?* 

Each day, our focus was to explore further, to search for an exit, which I knew was the right approach, but more and more… I was starting to see Rav’s point.

The goal had been to reach the part of the mall that was poorly rendered. Everyone in our group chat thought the same thing: ‘*somewhere on the disintegrating fringes there will be an exit!’* 

But we had found those fringes. And there was no exit.

We came across *Wolmort’s, Brgr Kngs,* and ∀pple stores full of warped iPhones and chairs fused with ceiling lamps. But there weren't any real exits inside these places.

Instead there were cracks within walls oozing more of that same silver *non-material* that killed Prof Ed. Our brightest minds from Groups B and C would try new approaches to interacting with the silver ooze. And those same minds would attempt to inscribe various math ‘*exit’* formulas onto the ooze as well.

Nothing yielded results.

The non-matter killed anyone who dared touch it, and the only math equation that actually worked was the one for duplication (which Rav and I had forbidden each other to use).

It's as if the harder we all tried, the *less* likely we were to find an exit.

The possibility of escape felt like it was approaching closer and closer to zero.

We had travelled over 140 miles away from the center, almost three full months of perpetual walking.

 I was ready for that week off.

I was ready for respite.

And then, we found it.

*The library.*

\*\*\*

It was massive. 

It took up the entire north wall of the mall plaza Rav and I entered. Instead of several floors of commercial mannequins and furniture staring back at us, we could see window after window full of mahogany bookshelves, shiny wooden globes, and reading desks.

There were actual *lights inside* too. 

Not some awful ceiling fluorescents or lamps, but actual *candles.*

We entered slowly and cautiously, soaking in the architecture that looked elegantly carved from maybe two centuries ago. The word “Victorian” came to mind.

Splinter groups B and C were actually the first to discover the libraries. In fact, it was from their encouragement that we ventured further out and discovered ours. 

It appeared that there was perhaps a colossal, continuous **Library Ring** around the mall on all sides (at around the 155 mile radius mark).

Our splinter groups had just reached different sides of it.

\*\*\*

Rav and I ate our lunch in a reading area next to the library’s foyer. It felt so nice to be seated in a hand-carved, warmly lit room surrounded by natural wood hues. 

There was even a small fireplace at one end, keeping the temperature cozy.

Somehow, all of the flames were perpetual. The candles were everlasting and *brighter* than ordinary candles, illuminating large hand-painted portraits throughout the walls. 

Just when we thought the mall would go on forever, we encountered this strange, 18th century relic building.

*Was it going to be another 155 miles of library now?* 

*What did it mean about this dimension’s layout?* 

Rav and I excitedly pointed with our sandwiches, discussing the possibilities. I accidentally sent a large piece of salami flying to the floor—and that’s when I heard someone clear their throat.

"Und wer sind Sie?“

Our conversation froze. Rav and I turned to see a tiny pair of tiny spectacles staring at us. Tiny spectacles sitting on the nose of a slightly greying, mustachioed man with a pipe clenched in his mouth. He leaned against the doorframe, eying us suspiciously.

Rav spoke first. “Uhh… excuse me?”

The man blew a small puff of coal-black smoke “Ah. English. I see.” 

His tiny, perfectly circular glasses made the rest of his head look overly large. His dark, stygian suit matched the black leather shoes which strode towards us calmly.

“Willkommen. I am Schrödinger. And you are?”

We both put down our sandwiches.

“Ermm… I’m Claudia.”

“I’m Rav...”

He stared at our massive camping backpacks that lay haphazardly on the floor. Then he inspected our 7-Eleven sandwiches as if they were alien creatures.

“You wear strange uniforms.” He gestured to our hiking clothes. “Not academics, surely?”

Neither Rav nor I knew where to start.

“Uh.. well technically, we both are students, yes.”

Schrödinger looked directly at my face and puffed from his pipe. “Forgive me, Fräulein but intellectual pursuits are a little ill-suited to feminine temperaments. Don’t you think?”

“I... ” words tripped on themselves in my throat. “What…?”

Then the man pointed his pipe at Rav. “And you, a Hindu. I’ve studied some Oriental metaphysics too. Is that what you used to arrive here?”

Neither of us knew how to react. Eventually, Rav gave his head a shake. “Wait a minute. … Are you *the* Schrödinger? Erwin Schrödinger?”

The man took a step back and exhaled a large puff of black.  “I am the one asking questions. How did you arrive?”

Rav and I stood up from the table. The vibe felt pretty threatening.

“We got here some three months ago.” I pointed outside the window beside us, out towards the darkness. “We walked in. From the mall.”  

“*Mall*?” It was like he had never heard the word before. He gestured to the front entrance nearby. “You came from *there*?”

“Yes. Uh. From the steps outside?”

“You’re telling me…”  Schrödinger held his pipe above his head, as if nursing a headache“...You *strolled up* the steps and entered *Der Mathemandelsring* without an invitation?” 

Rav scratched his neck. “I mean… we were forced into here. It was kind of against our will, we don’t mean any—”

“—Only inducted theoreticians may grace these halls!” Schrödinger pointed with his pipe accusingly. “This is not some luncheon hall.”

Rav shot me a worried look. 

“Sorry, sorry. We are both students.” He quickly grabbed one of our napkins and wiped our crumbs off the parlor table. “We were just looking for a dining area. I’m a theoretician too though. I study Applied Math.”

Schrödinger adjusted his glasses—they now reflected the fireplace’s flames.

“You? A theoretician?”

“Yes.” 

“Who brought you? Von Neumann?”

“No. I… We brought ourselves?”

Schrödinger shook his head. I could see his face was getting flush. “We do not allow for loitering drifters here.”

“But hold on…” Rav unfolded a piece of paper from his pants. It was our own duplication formula (to be used in emergencies only). He held out the complex equation as evidence.

“I can read all of this. In fact, I wrote all of this. I’m a mathematician too.”

Schrödinger took a step towards us, and  examined the creased paper.

*“We could also just leave,”* I whispered to Rav.

Rav squeezed my hand back.

“An interesting solution to *Banach-Tarski,”* Schrödinger tapped at the page. “So you know a bit of math.”

“I do.” Rav smiled, trying to appear cooperative. “In fact, I would love to learn more. We’ve been trying to find a particular formula on our journey. An escape solution. Maybe this library could be of some use to—”

“—And since you have not been properly inducted upon your arrival here—then *I* shall be your officiant.” Schrödinger exhaled a large dark puff at our faces.

He went to unfurl an enormous scroll from the ceiling, which was covered in dense math.

“*Der Mathemandelsring* is a sacred place. You are familiar with the entrance exam, no doubt.”

Schrödinger produced a fountain pen and began to add Greek letters on the giant paper. His wrist whipped back and forth, ending with a flourish for the final stroke.

The air stirred with reverberation. 

A gigantic wooden crate appeared beside Schrödinger. A large brown box.

“Using all of the Arithmancy at your disposal, you must *overcome my equation,* young applicant.”

“Sure…” Rav looked at me, holding his paper out and grabbed a marker from his pocket. “So this is like a math test?”

Schrödinger used his pipe to tap the side of the large box.

“Surely you’ve heard of my *cat.”*

The front wall of the box fell forward, revealing a massive black *jaguar.* It awoke from a long-coiled slumber.

Adrenaline hit me from the mere sight of the animal. It was enormous. 

The cat yawned and stepped out of the box, exposing large, shining fangs. Its yellow eyes darted between Rav and myself. A low rumble came from its throat.

“Woah. What? This *cat* is your test?” Rav backed away,

“Yes.” Schrödinger resumed smoking his pipe. His puffs stretched into long black whisps which appeared to flow *into* the cat.

“Your exam begins now.” 

The cat hissed, and pounced toward us.

We scurried behind a reading desk. 

The whole place had rows of reading desks like a classroom, but they weren't very tall, or obstructive. 

We watched rather helplessly, as the jaguar leapt from desk to desk and flanked us.

“Her name is Vanta.” Schrödinger followed.

The car leapt onto a desk closer to us. For a split second, I saw the cat fall onto its neck in a brutal misstep. But then that reality flickered away. The cat instead glared ferociously atop the nearby desk. 

Rav reached into his breast pocket and pulled out the revolver. “Back away! Back!”

As soon as gun’s barrel aimed at the cat, she hopped away and slinked behind a desk.

*She’s seen guns before.* 

“Quick! Now’s our chance!” I pulled Rav. We scrambled out a side exit.

\*\*\*

With the door slammed shut, we found ourselves inside a massive library hall. Bookshelves reached almost two stories high. Tall rolling ladders installed everywhere. We ran down the closest aisle, carefully looking over our shoulders

“Your Glock handy?” Rav asked.

I could feel the small pistol’s weight shuffle under my flannel. I had really hoped I wasn't going to have to use it … but this was life or death.

“Yeah.”

When we reached the far end of the aisle, I pulled out the handgun, and undid the safety.

Nothing had followed behind us. But that didn’t mean shit. I remembered learning about cougars from camp once. Their paws were cushioned so you couldn’t hear them sneaking, and they'd stay low to the ground so you couldn’t see their shadow…

“Okay,” Rav said, swallowing lumps. “If it's just the panther. I think we can take her. Don’t aim for the head, just the center mass. Body shots.”

I nodded and watched the ceiling candelabras swing as something jumped from one to the other.

The cat was prowling atop the bookshelves.

“Don’t rush.” Rav whispered. “Wait til she gets closer…” 

The yellow eyes glinted, I could feel Vanta singling me out. She wanted to pounce down on the smaller, more vulnerable human. I lined up my iron sights, and tested holding the trigger…

*BLAM!*

The top bookshelf exploded into splinters. 

The cat slipped off and landed back-first onto the ground with a *CRACK!*  

Then Vanta *flickered.* Suddenly she was standing upright, as if landing perfectly.

“Get back!” Rav fired two rounds. The cat flickered out of existence again.

 The marble ground sparked from the bullets. 

The cat reappeared, totally unharmed.

“Oh good.” Rav said.

Vanta took a leap towards us. I closed my eyes and fired. 

*Rrreeeeooow!!”*

*THUD!* The cat fell right before me, I could see her wince from a fresh bullet wound on her shoulder. She hissed and began to flicker in and out of existence like an old projector.

My gun followed her tail until she scampered behind another aisle.

“How did you hit it?” Rav grabbed my hand. He dragged us back.

“I don’t know! I just shut my eyes and… I don’t know!”

We backed up a small set of steps.

“Shut your eyes?... “ Rav squinted, digging around his memory. “Of course!”

“What?”

“Observer effect!”

We ran into the open center of the library where we could see all the bookshelf aisles behind us. We both scanned for any signs of the predator.

“Schrödinger’s Cat is both alive and dead," Rav said. "She won’t be just one or the other until someone observes her — until we collapse her quantum state.”

“But we *have* been observing her. In fact, there she is.” 

I pointed to a distant bookshelf labelled *Geographia,* where black shadow was prowling behind book spines.

“Yes, and because we keep watching her, I think her “alive” state is able to recrystallize over and over…

“So she's …  permanently alive?”

“As long as we keep looking at her.”

Her head poked out one of the aisles. Her whiskers rose up as she *snarled.*  Then she pulled back into the shadows and crawled away.

“I think if we close our eyes while delivering the killing blow … then she might actually stay dead.”

I had trouble keeping a straight face. 

“We’re supposed to kill this cat … without looking at it?”

“Yes. And we can’t look at the remains either.”

We heard the scrape of her feet around the edges of the library. She was running outside of visibility, circling around the bookshelves behind us.

“Well we sure can’t see her now!”

“Yes. But because she was last seen alive, she will stay alive.”

Her running quickened, I saw her tail whip behind a series of antique earth globes. Each one spun as she bolted past them.

“Rav. This is fucked!”

“Here, grab.” 

He ripped out a page from a book on a shelf.

Still aiming my gun, I grabbed the page he gave me. It was a map of some lake.

“Once the cat comes close. Hold the page out in front of you.” He demonstrated, holding another page against his eyes.

I briefly did the same. The parchment was thin enough for me to barely see the outline of objects ahead of me. “If you can’t see her when you shoot her, she’ll stay dead.”

“I see.” I said. And then thought: *this if fucked.*

We both followed the creaks of the cat as she slithered between bookshelves. She would growl, throwing her voice and bouncing it off the walls behind us. She knew what she was doing.

We backed up to a large reception-looking desk which Rav helped me stand on top of. I would cover us from higher ground. Rav stuck to the floor.

“Psst!” Rav pointed at an antique book cart, loaded with books. I saw it jostle for a second. 

Then it startled to travel in our direction

“What the…”

Behind the rolling iron wheels, I saw a pair of paws. *This cat was smarter than I thought.* Vanta pushed the cart in our direction and came prowling behind it for cover.

“Here we go.” Rav ran to one side of the wheels. “Cover me!”

I held my gun steady.

Briefly, I tried lifting Rav’s paper over my eyes. But it was too opaque at this distance. I threw it away. 

Then the cat leaped out. 

Rav squeezed his eyes and fired. 

The cat howled with injury. She began to flicker. 

Then the cat flickered her wounds away, and stared at me, *the last observer.*

“Fuck!” I lined up my shot and fired.

I shut my eyes and fired twice more.

“Shit!” I said.

“What?!”

“I think I got it!”

“Coming back!”

“Coming back?”

“Running towards you!”

“Who? The cat?”

“No, me!

“Can I open my eyes?”

“No!”

In what might have been the longest moment of my life, I kept my eyes closed and his behind the  desk.

I heard Rav’s footsteps clomp towards me, and I *thought* I heard the scampering of paws.

“Is it behind you!?”

“I don’t think so.”

“I hear its paws!”

“No! Claudia, *do not* look this way!”

I covered my face, and cradled myself, holding my breath. Rav’s arms found me and spun me to face the wall.

“You can open your eyes now, just don’t look behind us.”

Rav and I were both behind the wooden desk and staring at a shelf of books.

“Did you see it die?” I asked him.

"I did. But then you shot it?”

I swallowed a guilty rock. “I think I was still ‘observing’ it. So I fired again.”

“So did *you* kill it?”

“I don’t know. Did it follow you?”“No. I didn’t sense anything.”

“But I heard some scampering.”

“Are you sure it wasn’t me?”

“I don’t know. Let’s just… wait.”

And wait we did, for what felt like an eternity. We held each other, facing the wall, not looking back, as if we were Orpheus and Eurydice. I kept imagining the stealthy Jaguar creeping up behind us, waiting for the perfect moment to leap onto our heads.

But it never came.

After we counted two hundred Mississippi's, Rav stood up and carefully left our hiding spot.

He lifted his arms and walked out backwards towards the center. Nothing attacked him.

I sensed a powerfully strong tobacco-smell mixed with burning tar. 

Then came a scoff.

“Well I guess that's one way to do it. You’ve vanquished Vanta.”

Rav froze in his steps. I saw him tentatively turn his head.

“Yes. You may both look this way. I've boxed her up.

With the utmost hesitancy I turned around to see Schrödinger standing between the book cart and a wooden box that appeared on his left.

His pipe was clenched in his teeth. His arms were crossed brusquely against his charcoal three piece suit.

“You were supposed to use *Arithmancy*. And yet you did not use a single formula. What a shame.”

Rav wiped a pool of accrued sweat from his forehead. “What? I thought we just had to overcome your… cat.”

“Anyone can shoot an animal with a boorish revolver. What a pathetic aptitude you’ve shown.”

Rav scratched his beard. He unfolded our copy equation from his pocket once more. “I can still duplicate myself if you want. We understand how math works in this worl—”

“—No, it's too late now.” Schrödinger waved his hand. “The test is over. You have failed to demonstrate any mathematical ability.”

“No. Please.” Rav waved his hands until they came together in a small prayer. “There's got to be another way. Another chance.”

“No second chances. Your exam is a failure. You must leave.”

\*\*\*

Because of his ability to summon *boxes of jaguars*, we didn't push our luck with Schrödinger.

He very cordially guided us towards the entrance we came through.

Although definitely a little saddened that we couldn't see more of the **Library Ring,** I was just happy to leave with our lives.

“This door will soon become locked for you, and you may never enter again.” Schrödinger pointed at the exit foyer. “Respect the rules of *Der Mathemandelsring*”

Rav seemed to acquiesce with a glum nod.

When we opened the door and looked outside, I could see that the oblique darkness of the mall was gone. Instead, we saw overcast clouds over a *well-manicured lawn?*

“Wait what…” I said, astounded. “Where are we?”

Schrödinger furrowed his brow. “ Fraulein, that is outside. And that is where you will go.”

“But this isn't where we were before.” Rav stared with wide eyes. “Is this… are we in America?”

For some reason this really made Schrödinger laugh. His mustache danced a little on his face.  His yellow teeth shone. ”No, you are not in *America.* And you are not allowed back inside. Auf Vederzen.”

He waved at us until we left. The door was shut tight, I could hear locks being put in place. 

There was a cobblestone road up to this library, and I could see two old horse-drawn carriages parked around a sort of thoroughfare. Birds flew above us, cawing and landing on distant trees. 

It was the widest open space we had seen in months. 

“Where are we?”

I checked my phone. 

I still had reception.

\*\*\*

Everyone was dressed in breeches and dresses, all woven from wool and linen. 

They must have been groundskeepers or landscapers part of the estate, they all eyed us with open curiosity, but kept their distance.

We were too afraid to talk to anyone at first, so we walked out a bit further and watched the **Library Ring** shrink behind us. Though out here, it was no longer a ring at all. Just a large building, made of stone and glass windows. You could mistake it for an old church.

Walking out further, we came across something hard to grasp at first. It honestly felt like I was looking at a picture from a history book. 

It was an old European village.

I saw an assembly of cottages, cobble roads, dogs and children running about, hooting and hollering as if they were re-enacting a Charles Dickens novel. There was even a bell-tower in the distance.

*“And whose might you be?”*

It was a boy. He came to us running, rolling a metal wheel with a stick like it was the best thing in the world. *“Youse just came from the library, eh?”*

Rav and I both turned to each other and took a deep breath.

\*\*\*

The village was called **Yore.** 

At first, everyone stayed away from us, which made it awkward. They would gawk at our clothes, whisper to each other, and never return our waves of hello. It’s like they thought we were ghosts or something.

But in a few short hours, the village children kept visiting us, and when the fact spread that *we came from the library,* everyone's opinion quickly changed.

We were given proper handshakes, and treated as ‘educated aristocrats’.

“The library always brings prosperity.” A man pulling a cow said.

They gave us a warm meal at the town tavern, and allowed us to stay at the local inn, where we got our own dedicated room. I offered them a Bulgari necklace as payment which they happily accepted. 

“Please, stay as long as you need, honorable librarians.”

\*\*\*

By day two, we had gotten to know the barkeeper downstairs, who introduced us to the sheriff across the street, who took us to visit several farmers down the road, who showed us where we could harvest fresh vegetables for ourselves. 

There was an abundance of crops this year.

Everyone was astonishingly nice, no one seemed all that bothered by the mud caked on their roads, or the pallid greyness of the sky … things just were as they were.

\*\*\*

Our days in town move by fast, and I had to be selective with how often I turned on my phone to record these entries.

On our third day, Rav and I went for a trek outside the town, just to get a sense of the landscape. We had planned to finish some of the last of our snacks from the mall on a long hike.

We had barely walked a mile out, when we came across the same old library we left the previous day. And then past the library, we *looped* back into the town.

No matter what direction we went into, the fields full of ankle-high grass would always send us back to **Yore**.

It’s like we were inside some kind of enclosed universe.

When Rav and I made this discovery, we both sat down in the grass field.

We held each other. And teared up. 

There were no words. But we both felt the same kind of sadness.

We still were not free.

We were inside something even more miniature than the mall.

\*\*\*

Our batteries were running low, and we knew we couldn’t recharge them anywhere here. 

We sent abrupt farewells to any of our friends and family still communicating via our phones. And we sent farewells to our group chat with splinter Groups B and C (though they both had both gone unresponsive after entering the Library Ring).

Maybe there was still some specific equation that could still get us out. 

Maybe there was a math test we could take to try and get back in the Library…

But somehow both Rav and I could sense we were officially *very* far from home. 

Wherever we were. We were going to be here for a while.

\*\*\*

That night, we camped out in the field.

There weren’t any stars that came out at night, the low-hanging grey cloud appeared to be a perpetual feature, but nonetheless, we laid in the grass and said goodbye to our old lives.

The all-dark sky slowly swallowed away our past.

\*\*\*

But, just like with everything, time passes. Emotions wane. After a week, we learned that **Yore** was *not* like the mall. 

We found ourselves sitting in at the town chapel each morning, just like everyone else, taking comfort in the feeling of being around living people.

Whereas the **infinite mall** had been dead, and soul-sucking, **Yore** was at least alive, moving, and breathing.

Rav and I joined the group of farmers and helped with the crops. 

We were given proper, rancher clothes, and got down on our knees and palms, digging up the potatoes by hand. 

We even helped peel and cook them at the town hall kitchen. There was a communal dinner every night.

It felt a little disingenuous to be trying to distract ourselves like this. Rav and I both knew the lives we had before. Our former dream of escape…

But the more we accepted that this could just be a prolonged break—A prolonged ‘vacation’ for ourselves—the easier it was to embrace life as it was now.

We both longed for some inner peace.

\*\*\*  
\*\*\*  
\*\*\*

Many months have passed since settling in **Yore.**

This digital version of my journal will have to be laid to rest.

I’ve used this as a historical record for our time in the mall, but it's since evolved into my own diary of events which I’m writing on paper now.

I’m sending these words while I still have bars on my phone, while using up the final juice of my last spare battery.

To whomever finds this story, you should know that Rav and I are perfectly content here. 

Just yesterday we had joined a crew of landscapers tidying up the grass around the sacred library. We were pulling weeds outside the thoroughfare when a boy beside us pointed at the library’s front door.

It had opened briefly to let out some black smoke, then closed again within a moment.

Rav and I watched the door. For a moment we even contemplated rushing at the latch with our spades and rake in an effort to try and pry it open.

But then the urge passed.

Rav offered me some berries he’d collected from a copse nearby. They were juice and sweet. “Forget the Library, forget the mathematicians. Our lives are our own now.”

A warm breeze filtered through my hair

I held his hand and gave it a squeeze. *“Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not.”*

“And what philosopher is that? “

“Epicurus” I said.

“Is he the one who loved food?”

“No, that is actually a misattribution. He liked food but only as a simple pleasure, not as an indulgent luxury.”

Rav ate a berry. “Right. So it sounds like he would definitely be approving of our situation right now.”

I thought about what other Greek philosophers might say about our current circumstances. *Were we inside some kind of Plato's cave? Were we just deluding ourselves to stay sane?...*

I brushed some dirt off my pants and gave a long exhale.

“I don't care what the philosophers think. I have you. I'm happy with you.”

He looked at me carefully, as if to check if I was joking. 

“You mean you're still not sick of our very long first date?”

I shook my head.

We both kissed.

At some point later we’d find a way back into the library. But not for now. Not anytime soon.

\*\*\*

After calling it a day, we went back to the village.

They were putting on a play in the town square that afternoon. A community theater rendition of *Hamlet*. We were both excited to see how they would pull off the *“to be or not to be’*’ scene. 

“You think they'll use an actual skull?” Rav asked.

“Even if they do…” I squeezed his hand. “... I’ll still only see it as a carton of expired [yogurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/).”
