For those of you who have joined Timber Creek, welcome! I’m Cassidy, a freshly graduated senior, and also the person who’s going to save your dumbass from dying before your first assignment is due. You see, I have no reason to help you, but… When I first got into Timber Creek, the mystery of it all almost made me lose my mind. I sympathize with you younglings, therefore, out of the kindness of my heart, I am giving you a little help. Don’t take it for granted though, I better get a “Cassidy is a heaven sent angel” as your picture day quote or something, but anyway, let’s begin shall we? 

If you got into Timber Creek, it’s because of one of two things. Either you’ve been a failure in life, and this is your parent’s last resort to getting you on track, or you're a psychopath who loves the thrill of possibly getting murder by a shapeshifting janitor. Whatever it is, you’re here now, and there’s a lot you need to know before you start getting comfortable. I won’t promise a smooth, adrenaline free couple of years, however what I can guarantee is by the end of it, you will get grades that would be otherwise unattainable. That’s the trade-off, survive Timber Creek, and you’re assured a 4.0 GPA, you have my word for it.

Now, Timber Creek has a list of things that could possibly cause you a slow, painful death. I will do my best to inform you on a few of them. Starting off with the many entities that roam the campus. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Gabriel (The Shape Shifting Janitor)***

Since I already brought old Gabe up, why not begin with him. Gabriel is the Janitor of Timber Creek. A damn good one too if I might add. The amount of bloody messes this man has had to clean up is impressive considering how spotless the campus usually is. Gabe is one of the more forgiving entities. He likes to be left alone, and you’ll find a hard time getting in his way. Mostly encountered in the bathrooms, you can also find him mopping the cafeteria, gym auditorium, and the school halls, however if you do end up seeing him in the last one, I’m afraid it might be too late for you. He only cleans the halls after hours, and if there’s one thing you should take from this entire document, it’s **NEVER** be in Timber Creek after hours. Gabriel takes his job very seriously, and it is of the upmost importance you respect that. Avoid wet floor signs at all costs, if you see one, walk the other way. In the unfortunate event that you do place a muddy foot on a freshly cleaned tile, get on the floor, close your eyes, and cover your head. You’ll hear footsteps surrounding you, maybe even feel a few heavy stomps on your legs and back. **DO NOT** react. That’s just Gabe trying to get you to look at him, which is what we’re trying to avoid here. He might also attempt to shift into teachers, and order you to get off the ground. Or even other students, and viciously make fun of you for being a scardy cat. Ignore all of it. It is crucial you remain calm and composed. You’ll know it’s safe to get up when you hear him grab the wet floor sign, put it in his squeaky mop trolley, then walk the opposite direction to where you are. Hopefully it won’t be long enough for you to miss your next class, just be grateful you didn’t get mauled to death.

***Andela (The Bathroom Ghost)***

Andela is the ghost of a child that is known for haunting the school bathrooms. She’s also one of the less problematic Timber Creek Entities. You’ll encounter her frequently, so get used to it. When you walk into the bathrooms, you have a chance of seeing a small, pale girl standing at the end of the room, facing the wall. She’ll have long blonde hair that reaches the floor and a plain white gown. Don’t panic, just go attend to business as usual. You can’t leave if you see her, she’ll follow you out, and I can guarantee you won’t make it back to class. For all the guys out there, I’ve heard Angela may also stand behind while you’re using the urinals, which I’m guessing can be a little awkward, so it’s best you avoid them altogether. If you’re in a stall, and you hear knocking, look underneath the door, if you see her gown, stay in there until she walks away. Angela may also try to speak to you sometimes. For your own sake, don’t acknowledge her. She’s known to tell stories, ranging from her abusive father to simple things like what her favorite kids show is. Just do what you’re in there to do and you’ll be fine. Oh, and one last thing, the only time it’s acceptable to run away from her, is if you walk into the bathrooms, and she’s facing you instead of the wall. Get ready for a chase because she’s a lot faster than she looks.

***Leers (The Demon Classmates)***

Every class has at least one leer. What’s a leer, you might ask? Good question. Leers are demons who play the role of a classmate to try enticing you into forming relationships with them. They will be the greatest friends you’ve ever had, but little do you know, these creatures are just very efficient predators. They make you comfortable, have you trust them more than anyone else, then when the times right, they’ll rob of all your senses. Leaving you incapable of smelling, seeing, feelings, tasting, and hearing. It’s quite cruel, and almost always unexpected. However, don’t be too shaken. You can still make normal human friends without fearing for your safety. So long as they’re able to drink a glass of lemonade without gagging (Which are provided at the cafeteria for $1.50). I know, it’s an odd weakness to have, and you might be thinking, “I’ll just test everyone before befriending them.” But, oh no, it’s never that simple, is it? Remember when I said *“almost always unexpected.”* You see, leers are master manipulators. I know people who’ve been well aware that their best friend's a leer, and still refuse to push them away. Leers know the human mind more than any licensed psychologist could. They know what makes us happy, what makes us feel comfortable and wanted. They know your insecurities, and they know exactly how to make you feel like they aren’t there anymore. Not to mention how each one of them looks like they came straight out of the twilight films. Hell, I’m pretty sure the prom queens for the last 8 years have been leers, they are just so god-damn perfect. So be weary, you must resist the temptations. Once you know who the leer is, make sure you stay as far away as possible. All it takes is one conversation, and you're done for.

***Libitina (Timber Creek’s Principal)***

To run the hell on earth that Timber Creek is, it’s only understandable that they left the reincarnation of Lucifer in charge. Imagine Miss Trunchbull, but ten times worse and with demonic fangs plus crimson red eyes. That’s Principal Libitina for you. Now, avoiding any interactions with her is easy, just follow the policy book that you’re given at orientation, don’t be a nuisance, and most importantly, **DO NOT** touch the flowers by the school gate. Miss Libitina is a massive gardener, and she hates when people mess with her plants. There’s a lot that will happen to you before the teachers are forced to send you to her office, but that is basically a death sentence. Miss Trunchbell had only one medieval torture device at her disposal. Principal Libitina on the other hand has a dungeon filled with them. Including (but no exclusive to), things like the Gridiron, which is basically a massive grill…for people of course. As well as the Thumbscrew, which squishes your thumb through the turning of a screw, self-explanatory. Her dungeon is also said to have a pit full of venomous snakes that many students have been thrown into, but the validity of these aren’t confirmed. Miss Libitina doesn’t have a high survival rate, so in honest terms, no one really know what happens to people who end up being on her bad side. Just be on your best behavior and pray she doesn’t catch you scribbling on the desks or something.

***I shall now get into the places that you should be careful around in Timber Creek, of which they are many. So take what I say next as gospel and STAY VIGILANT.***

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***The Pool***

Timber Creek has a massive Olympic sized swimming pool by the field. It’s gorgeous, and for those of you who will join swimming club, you will have a great time using this facility. However, if you do go into the water, you’ll notice how there's a massive metal cage blocking off the last ten meters of the pool. It’s there for a reason. The end of the pool is hard to describe. Many have theorized it’s a portal to another parallel universe, or even one of Miss Libitina’s fucked up side-experiments. But as it goes for most things in Timber creek, we just don’t know. If you swim right up to the cage and look through to the other side, you won't be able to see the end of the pool. It looks as if you're staring into a massive ocean, infinitely long and infinitely deep. The illusion only works so long as you’re underwater, once you breach the surface, the pool looks of normal size. Sometimes you may even see large shadows looming in the distance. A friend of mine once saw a great white shark the size of a blue whale, another saw a colossal, eel like creature, rubbing against the cage. It really does your head in because you know physically nothing of that size should be able to fit in there, but they do, and it’s fascinating. Occasionally, massive squid tentacles may poke through the gaps in the cage, just be careful, you **DO NOT** want to be yanked by one of them. Other than that, the pool is pretty chill honestly, just don’t forget to bring a pair of googles, and look where you’re going.

***Gym Showers***

There’s not much to this one, just don’t use the last stall. It pours blood instead of water. If you see someone walk out of there that you don’t recognize, leave the premises. That’s right, go to the front desk and ask for a sick slip, then go home. You’ll be followed all the way back, doesn’t matter if you’re walking, driving, or taking a fucking helicopter. You’ll be followed. Once you’re home, lock yourself in and stay in there till the next sunrise. Fun story though, one of the guys in my class used the shower as a dare, he ended up killing his own mother when he got home…well okay maybe not so fun story. But you get the gist, last stall = big no no.

***The Well***

Next to the field, right at the very end of the school where the boundary walls are, there’s an old well. It’s surrounded by a little picketed fence and the only place there that has dead grass around it. It’s been a little school tradition to hop over the fence, and try to throw something you cherish into the well. From what I heard, it’s the classic, grant you a wish type B.S. It might be true because a lot of people have done it, but it’s not as easy as it may sound. You see, the well is…well, simply put…alive. It breathes. You can hear and feel gusts of wind flowing out it’s mouth if you look into it. Be extremely cautious. The well is known to put people in a trance. Either making them think that a loved one is trapped in there, calling for them, or even just showing them something that would make you want to lean a little too far. If you do fall for its tricks, the bricks will shift, causing you to lose balance, and you will plummet god knows how deep into the abyss. A teacher once told us that the well leads you right down to hell, and anyone who’s fallen into it is now burning for the rest of eternity. Spooky fucking shit, so moral of the story, don’t risk your life for a stupid wish.

***Janitor’s Closet***

The Janitor’s closet is the old room right next to the music hall. This is supposedly the place where shapeshifting entities like Gabriel are born. It reeks, smelling of old meat, and has this…bone chilling aurora about it. I just can’t put it into words. Now and then, the door is left open by Gabe, and you can catch a glimpse of what’s inside. The entire room looks like the inside of a mouth, red, meaty and extremely damp. It’s said that if you were to walk in there, you’d see things that our minds aren’t even capable of comprehending. That room also houses a number of disease carrying bacteria. One student, who got lost and accidentally walked into there, thinking it was a classroom, ending up giving every single person in the school whooping cough. Each student had to be quarantined, and the school was closed for a good few months. That room has some bad juju going on, and it’s in your best interest you steer clear from it.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, you’ve made it to the end, hopefully still enthusiastic about your first year in Timber Creek. I have left out a lot of other potential dangers as I still have college applications to worry about, but if you guys really want to, I might consider sharing some more secrets. Not to mention my own weird and wacky experiences in Timber Creek, like the time I had to run away from blood hungry vampires in the detention room. Oh, and the other time when I had fallen asleep in class and woke to the school being closed, just to find all my teachers sacrificing animals in the middle of the field. There’s a lot to talk about, and I’m willing to divulge, but for now, best of luck with your studies you rascals, signed with love, *Cassidy*.
