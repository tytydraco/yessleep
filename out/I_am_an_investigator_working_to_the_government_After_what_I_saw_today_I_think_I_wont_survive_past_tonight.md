At first, I didn't pretend to accept the job offer, however, I was in dire need for money due to me being a single parent. They offered to pay me 40 dollars an hour. I was suspicious at first, however I ended up accepting.

I got hired, and they assigned me to go into an old abandoned house 40km away from my location. It was on the middle of a local forest.I thought of giving up, however, they already hired me and I was already paid.So, it began. I started my car and drove to the location.

When I arrived, I saw that the house was much older than what I thought. It was maybe 150 years old. I left my car and picked up my work material. I entered the house as the door seemed to be already open, like if someone entered there first.

 I needed to do some work upstairs, so I grabbed my lantern and my work items and headed there. The stairs were creepy, like if they were going to fall apart at any moment. I finally reached upstairs, and I saw a lot of cobwebs.

 I started searching through the 2nd floor the evidence needed when I heard something walking in the 1st floor.I started panicking, dropped my work items and grabbed my lantern. I didn't notice but it was already night. I immediately felt like I was gonna die. I was meant to grab a weapon to self-defense but I forgot. So, all I had was my lantern and work items.

I started heading downstairs with my lantern, trying to not make a sound, and, to confirm my horror, I could see a very tall shadow on the corner of my eyes. I would now start running through the house seeking to see an exit or a basement where I could hide in. Lucky for me, I found the basement. I quickly entered and put everything in there against the door to stop the figure from entering the basement. However, I figured out that that was not gonna hold for long, so I started thinking of a plan.

Eventually, I would start searching through the room seeking an exit, however, to my worst nightmare, I would find none. My only option is now stay for the night and pray to god that what is against the door will be able to hold. I start panicking as I heard something smashing against the door at 1 am.

 I started searching the room for a weapon, and to my luck, would be able to find an old pistol, maybe from the 1920s. It had only 3 bullets on it, and I think it was used for hunting. And, due to being old the door gave up and a 3 meter tall figure snuck itself into the basement. I shot him 3 times, where only once I was able to hit him, however it was enough time for me to return to my car.Now, the figure is persecuting me back home, and I am sure that if he is able to reach me, I will not survive.
