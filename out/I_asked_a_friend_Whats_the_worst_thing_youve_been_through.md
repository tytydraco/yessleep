A few years ago, a friend of mine was caught up in a slew of messages from a time when smart phones weren't a big thing and email wasn't a feature on everyone's phones. This topic came up when we were discussing the worst thing we've ever gone through, and my friend went quiet, before pulling out her phone to present the chain of e-mails.

 This is what she showed me.

Hi Mia, 

Sorry I couldn't make it to the party yesterday, won't go into details but I had a really bad mental health day. Grant rushed me to the doctors who prescribed me some new pills to try for 9 months and suggested I start therapy as soon as possible (which I'll hold off on until October as I'm so busy!) Hope you and the gang had a great time, and I've still got your present here for next time I'm in town! 

Best wishes, 

Helen

**Subject: Unlucky day!**

Hi Mia, 

You won't believe the weekend I've had. Me and Grant had a huge, very heated argument Sunday night while cooking which resulted in me slapping him (something I've NEVER done). But he was being so hostile towards me, I've never seen him look so evil.

 He locked himself in the study for the rest of the night and I've felt awful.

Then, on my way into work, a huge deer runs out in front of the car and I swerve and hit a tree. Thankfully I'm fine but the car's in bad shape and Grant didn't even answer the phone even though he works from home. I had to call work and ask to work from home for a while whilst the car's being fixed.

I'm hoping Bobby's garage can fix it like they fixed yours when you went down a ditch! I'll figure out how to  send you the dashcam footage of the deer once I get the car back, it was massive!

Hope you're having a better time than me.

  
Miss you, 

Helen

**Subject: Husband problem!!**

Hi Mia, 

Sorry to keep emailing, I know you're away this week so I don't expect a reply but I need a friend's opinion. 

Grant has been "off" since our argument on Sunday. I understand what I did was very wrong, but I've apologised and it wasn't very hard.

He usually likes to cook us both dinner, but he's only been making food for himself. He's usually first in bed and last to get up but now he just stays locked in his study all morning and evening. Then his hygiene has done a 180, he usually enjoys a shower every evening and keeps the house spotless but now he leaves dishes and washing up for me and hasn't bathed since Sunday. 

He also whispers threats of violence in my ear when I'm doing something.

Does your husband ever do this after a fight? Is this his way of getting back at me? I don't know what to do. He just looks at me with such...evil in his eyes now.

Chat soon, 

Helen

Hi Mia, 

Just me again for the daily rant. 

It's a nightmare living out here without a car, I feel so isolated. What's worse is I'm trapped here with someone who's trying to make it as uncomfortable as possible. 

Grant has upped his game at trying to upset me. He's now taken to leaving dishes and food out until they begin to stink. I called him out on it but he just smiles and laughs with that same hateful expression. 

I've decided I'm not cleaning up after a grown man. If he wants to leave everything out to stink and live in a filthy house then fine by me, he's the neat freak out of us. 

I don't know where this hateful malice has come from, there's no love in his eyes anymore.

Hope you're all enjoying your holiday, send my love. 

Have fun, 

Helen

**Subject: I'm getting a divorce**

Hi Mia, 

I don't know how else to say it. Grant and I are planning a separation. I'm in tears as I write this. Things have been amazing for over 15 years but one small stupid fight is what's ending us. 

It happened earlier today. I finished my work and went downstairs to find YET MORE filthy dishes and food left out. I couldn't do it anymore. I tried to open the study but as usual he's locked it. I was furious and banged on the door. Grant ignored me, so I tried to pick the lock with a coin. I could hear Grant laughing at me, so in the end I bashed the thin door down.  He was sat in his office chair, looking towards me with his mouth wide with shock. The whole study smelled foul where he hasn't washed for days in this boiling weather.

I laid into him, and told him this behaviour has to stop or I'm leaving. He continued looking at me with his stupid expression, and I told him I guess that answers it then and walked out. 

I expected him to call me back or come after me, but he didn't. I've shut myself in our room since, crying nonstop. My once loving husband has never done anything like this before, I'm devastated. 

I've packed a bag and I'm leaving tonight. I will see you soon. 

Regards, 

Helen

Hey Amber, 

Sorry it's late back home. I'm currently at the airport in Greece on a public computer but my flight's been delayed until tomorrow afternoon, so we're spending the night at a nearby cheap hotel.

I'm very concerned about Helen. I've just seen the multiple emails she has sent me through the week (I'll forward them to you now).

I've tried calling her and Grant multiple times but neither have picked up. 

If you're free, would you be able to drive up to her and see if she's alright? She's quite vulnerable and usually Grant helps her with her mental health but I'm not sure what's going on with them. 

Thanks. 

Lots of love, Mia

Evening Mia, hope you had a good trip. 

Yes that does seem a bit concerning, I'll head up to Helen's now.

I'll keep you posted!

Amber

Mia, it's Amber 

I need your help, please. 

I got to Helen's at around half 11 and the front door was wide open. This was already concerning as Helen and Grant always keep the doors locked.

I called out but got no answer so I went in. 

The whole house was HOT, like the air conditioning hadn't been on for ages. And the smell was horrific. There was food left out rotting in the living room and the kitchen was a mess. 

I then walked down the hall and the smell grew much worse. 

Then I walked into the study and couldn't believe what I saw. 

There was a rotting corpse sat at the desk, its head turned towards the door and its mouth wide open. I honestly can't get that image out of my head. 

I fled from the house and called the police. I stayed in my car in the driveway for hours, just wanting to see what was going on and if Helen was ok. 

I've been at the police station since last night. I showed them the emails you forwarded to me which seemed to help them. 

The body in the study was Grant. They think he died from a stab wound in his neck from a small kitchen knife. 

But what I don't understand is they believe Grant has been deceased since at least Sunday, how can that be if Helen was with him all week?

The police even managed to speak to someone from Bobby's garage today, who gave them the dashcam. There was no deer, Mia. It just shows her suddenly swerve off the road into the tree. 

They also found an empty box of pills on her bedside table, from the email she sent you.

 I don't remember what they were called (they had a long name) but whatever they were, the investigators said these were in no way what a doctor would've prescribed someone these as they were banned due to patients 'seeing demons and evil everywhere' and exacerbating any symptoms they already had. 

The medication causes severe delusions and hallucinations, along with strong side effects of paranoia and anxious moods. These pills basically alter your brain, essentially making side effects permanent if taken for more than 3 months.

 They're not sure if it's a detrimental mix up at the pharmacy, or if the doctor needs investigating. 

They think Helen stabbed Grant and he locked himself in the study terrified, where he died. But she said she only slapped him, right? Oh god Mia tell me they're wrong.

Nobody knows where Helen is, and from the empty pill box it's believed she's packed all the medication with her wherever she's gone.

The police suggested she could've gone to yours from your last email, I don't know your address so I'm not sure where to tell them to go. 

Please read this Mia. 

Please, don't go home....

  


My friend Amber was in therapy for a long time after this event. 

Mia and her family managed to get an earlier flight home, meaning sadly Mia did not read Amber's e-mail. 

Mia and her family didn't even make it into the house before Helen, under influence of the medication, emerged from their back garden with a large weed sickle and slaughtered the unexpecting family on their doorstep. 

Amber has since moved far away from the sleepy town which this experience took place. 

Helen has never been found.
