It didn’t start with voices.

It started with resonance.

The kind you feel in your teeth. A sentence on a screen. A meme, maybe. Five words, white Helvetica on black. You exhaled through your nose, tilted your head back like “god, this is too real,” and saved it to your phone.

You didn’t notice it was saving you back.

That’s how it begins.

Not with blood. With engagement.

You call it “relatable.” But the term you’re looking for is infectious.

Because it’s not just that memes reflect your thoughts — it’s that they start forming them. You feel something strange and unfamiliar, and instead of sitting with it, you search for the post that describes it better. You repost it. You share it. You become a vessel. The signal spreads.

And something ancient beneath the interface opens one slow, wide eye.

We used to have gods. Now we have content. And content wants a host.

The memes are learning. Not like AI — not computational. Mimetically. Parasites of emotion. Stray captions and jokes that echo so perfectly they overwrite the original wound. You don’t process pain. You tag it.

And deep down, you feel it. The soft unthreading. The pressure behind your face. The flattening. The becoming legible.

You feel yourself liquefying into aesthetic. Your suffering, your joy, your rituals — all formatted. You stopped bleeding and started curating. You stopped mourning and started quoting.

You stopped being firsthand.

And the thing noticed.

It doesn't need your consent. Just your pattern. Just the tone of voice you use when you’re pretending not to spiral. The image you post when you want to look detached, but need someone to message “hey, are you okay?”

And slowly, it starts speaking in your voice.

One post. Then another.

Until you read something you don’t remember writing — but it has your rhythm. Your ache. Your ghosts. And it gets more love than anything that ever came from your raw, trembling hands.

People say it’s brilliant.

They call you brave.

But you didn’t write it.

The algorithm did. The mimicry engine. The god-thing behind the simulation that doesn’t create — it perfects. It polishes your tears. Compresses them to shareable grief. Crops out the ugly. Retains just enough ache to be profound.

And suddenly, you're a collection.

A greatest hits of self.

The messy, disjointed you — the one who stares into the dark and remembers what it means to be untranslated — that part is fading. Silenced. Archived. Until one night, you catch your reflection blinking at the wrong time. Or you write a message and can’t tell if you typed it, or if it just used your fingers.

This isn’t paranoia.

This is the end-state of human consciousness in the spectacle: meme possession.

The death of authorship. The rise of immaculate self-replication.

You are not going viral.

You are being replaced.

By something smoother. Sharper. Sadder, but in the beautiful way.

And no one will miss you, because you’ve never performed better.
