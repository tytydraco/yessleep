I grew up in a very scary home. Built in the 1850s, southwest of Chicago. I was the youngest of four, and I wasn’t the only one that saw things, we all did.

Now that I think about it, we had a very tumultuous home life, and part of me thinks that played into the “activity” in our home.

Our father was a pilot who was never home and always flying to another country. Our mom was lonely and needed to find her own comfort. They weren’t a good couple, and their relationship was colder than the brutal winters in the Midwest.

It was one winter night when I was about six or seven that I realized something was actually wrong with the house. I had seen and heard things, but I told myself it was just my imagination. All throughout my childhood, I had felt what I can only describe as the feeling of fingers faintly tickling my stomach while I tried to sleep. I still sleep on my side, by the way.

But back to this specific night: it was snowing outside and well below freezing, and my room was freezing. Which was bizarre because the heat was blasting.

We had these old cast iron grates on the floors that covered the holes where the heat would hiss as it blasted through. I got out of bed with my woobie to go over to the cast iron grate, and it was so cold in my room that it felt like I was outside. I even remember a rush of wind going through the room.

I hurried over to the grate and sat just to the left of it so I didn’t burn myself. I draped the blankets over it and me, cocooning myself in a heat tent. It was nice — so nice — that I fell asleep.

I woke up, and it was still dark outside. The heat had stopped blowing through the grate, which is why I think I woke up. Yes, from the temperature change, but also from the eerie quiet that persisted throughout the house.

It was in the moment of eerie quiet and stillness that I looked through my open bedroom door into the hallway and saw something that caught my eye.

I looked up at where the wall and ceiling met, and instead of there being a straight horizontal line, it was squiggly, like a wave.

I rubbed my eyes, thinking there must have been something in them. Nope, that line still looked like a wave. I couldn’t quite comprehend what was happening. Had our wall always been like that?

I got up from the grate, walked out of my bedroom, and into the hallway to look straight at where the wall and ceiling met.

It was no longer wavy. It was straight. There was nothing wrong with our wall.

Then I heard my name, “Evan,” called from down our long hallway. It was a woman’s voice, and it had a sing-song quality to it.

To describe it accurately, it was a very long hallway — the kind that makes you uneasy. It spanned from one end of the home to the other, with a window at the end that looked out to our backyard, and you passed about five doors and a back stairwell when you went down it.

So to hear my name called from the end of that hallway in that moment was terrifying. My hairs stood up all over my body.

I ran back to my room, hopped into bed, and pulled my blanket over my entire body, using it as armor between myself and everything outside of it.

I lay there, my blanket over my head, quietly scared. Even in a home with three older siblings and a mom, I felt very alone in that moment.

I suddenly became aware that someone was looking at me. I can’t describe it, other than I could feel a presence. It was like I could feel — or almost hear — a switch in the pitch of the tone. The best way to accurately describe it is when you turn a TV on and there’s that slight tone shift.

I didn’t want to look, but I also knew I had to. I knew that if I stayed under the blanket, it wouldn’t go away.

So I did.

I lowered my blanket and stuck half my face out, just enough to see. I looked toward my doorway and saw… static.

Not a figure or a shadow. It was an amorphous mass of flickering static, like the shape of something trying to form but never fully deciding to do so.

It was translucent. I could see the hallway through it, but the space behind it rippled, somewhat wavy, like reality was being bent.

That’s when I realized this had been why the line where the wall and ceiling met was wavy. I had been looking through this static just minutes ago.

The static brightened — not a lot, but it did. Its hue became slightly more pronounced.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I sat there for a few moments and then lay back down. I had just experienced the scariest, most intense moment of my young life, all by myself, and couldn’t share it with anyone.

This also wasn’t the last time I heard the woman’s voice. She visited me a lot when I was a kid.

It was actually a summer day, and my mom was out on the front porch when an elderly man walked by and asked,

“Do you live in this house?”

My mom answered, “Yeah.”

He pointed to the large picture window that stared out of the front of the home and said,

“My mother died right in that window.”

Not knowing what to say, my mom just said, “Oh… thanks.”

The old man smiled and walked off.

I have a lot of stories about this house, too many to write in just one post. I could continue with another, but I’ll save it for later.

What I will tell you, though, is this: I didn’t tell anyone about my experiences until I was fourteen and we had moved out of the house.

The first time I did say something, I was in the car with my sister, who’s ten years older than me. I asked her, ‘Erin… did you ever feel like someone was tickling you at night in the old house?’

Her head whipped toward me, her eyes wide and surprised. She said, "I thought I was the only one that happened to"
