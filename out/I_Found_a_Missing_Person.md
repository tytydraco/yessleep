I was stirred out of sleep by a strange chanting noise coming from my backyard. When I cracked my eyes open in a groggy haze, I noticed strange shadows cast against the moonlight spilling through my cracked window. Alarmed, I turned around and saw her.

It was hard to make out her face in the darkness, but she was wearing the same clothes she had on in all the faded missing person posters strewn around town. In the flesh and peering through my window, there was an element to her that the posters failed to capture: a sort of thousand-yard stare uncommon in high schoolers.

When she realized I was awake and looking at her, there was no change in her demeanour at all. She just kept staring with the same blank expression, her hair dripping with what I thought was sweat.

Emma Davidson had been missing for long enough to end the city-wide manhunt, long enough for even the local news stations to lose interest, long enough for most of the missing person posters to peel off their poles and blow away in the wind.

Yet there she was, in my backyard at 2:00am. I called the police, threw some clothes on, and went outside to check on if she was okay.

Illuminated in the moonlight, I was able to identify some characteristics I couldn’t see when I was busy being scared shitless in my room. For example, her hair was dripping with blood, not sweat. In fact, her entire body was covered in fresh blood. She was also skinny. Far too skinny, as a matter of fact. It made sense she wouldn’t eat well for the time she was missing, but the sickly skeletal structure of her body was beyond anything I had thought possible.

She was still staring into my window when she vomited, swayed, and fell to her side. I couldn’t in good conscience leave her out in the cold, especially not when she was soaking wet, so I carried her into my living room while we waited for the police. The odd thing I noticed when I was carrying her was that, in spite of the blood, she was completely unharmed. There wasn’t so much as a broken nail anywhere on her body.

For several minutes, Emma failed to regain consciousness. Her sleep, however, was clearly troubled. She would intermittently kick her legs out and croak a plea for help, but I thought it best not to wake her.

When the police finally arrived and knocked on the door, she was jolted awake by the sound and started panicking. She looked into my eyes with the purest fear I had ever seen, and said these exact words:

“It killed Isabelle. She’s in the woods. It is in the woods. Please help me.”

The rest of her speech was too incoherent to make sense of. She was shepherded into the back of one of the police cars and driven off to someplace. I got the distinct impression that she would never recover from this experience, but I was snapped out of my introspection by one of the officers asking me questions, notepad and pen in hand.

“So,” he started. “You’re telling me Ms. Davidson woke you up with the murmuring? From your window?”

“Yes, officer,” I said.

“What was she saying?”

“I don’t know, officer.”

“Uh-huh.” He was unconvinced. I could tell as he scratched something into his little notepad. “And why is she covered in blood?”

“I don’t know, uh, officer.”

He looked at me with a weird expression. I think there was some kind of bureaucratic fury behind it, but I’m not a body language expert.

“Sir,” he said, “If you cooperate this whole thing is going to go by a lot easier.”

“I’m telling the truth.”

He sighed and pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose.

“Do I have your permission to search the premises?”

“Sure.”

I barely had time to get the word out before the officer muscled past me and into my living room, where he immediately got to work tearing through all my belongings in an effort to find… something, I guess. His slightly kinder partner took over the process of questioning in the meantime.

“Were there any disturbances in the area you remember hearing before you went to bed?”

“Uh, no, I don’t think so.” Bad Cop moved toward my bedroom. “Could you tell him to be careful in my room, please? Some of the stuff in there has sentimental value.”

“Uh-huh.” Good Cop wasn’t listening; he was too busy writing something. “Are there any weapons in the house we should know about?”

“I don’t think so? I mean, I have knives in the kitchen.”

Good Cop scratched something into the notepad. I felt like I was in The Twilight Zone. Bad Cop moved out of the house and into the backyard.

I gestured toward Bad Cop. “Yeah, that’s where I saw her. I can show you guys where she threw up if you like.”

“That won’t be necessary,” Good Cop assured me. “Would you mind going through the details one more time?”

I gave him what he wanted, and he appeared to be satisfied with my answers. He was heading back into the police car when Bad Cop returned from the backyard. He was holding his pistol, and immediately upon seeing me he took a rigid stance and started yelling.

“Sir, put your hands where I can see them! There doesn’t need to be anymore violence tonight!”

It took me a moment to register what was happening, and Good Cop (now partway into the police car) also appeared to be confused.

“Sir, I’m not going to ask you again! Put your fucking hands in the air!”

As I obeyed his instructions, I noticed that Bad Cop’s earlier expression of a sort of bored anger had been replaced with one of pure terror. His face was pale, his voice was cracking, and his hands were shaking as he held the pistol in front of him in a vice grip. He looked more like a terrified child than a big strong police officer, and he clearly tried to make up for that with the volume of his voice.

“You’re going to jail for a real long time, you sick fuck,” he said as he cuffed me. “A real long time.”

He threw me in the police car so hard I banged my shoulder pretty hard against the doorframe. From inside the vehicle, I could see the two officers’ lips moving. Bad Cop looked to be frantically explaining something to Good Cop, and I could see the latter’s expression turn from confusion to horror as Bad Cop continued to speak. Eventually, Bad Cop stepped away to make a call and Good Cop got into the driver’s seat of the car.

“What happened?” I asked.

“You have the right to remain silent, everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of…” he launched into the full spiel, and I was sat there dumbfounded the entire drive to the station.

I spent the night in a holding cell, and stayed there until the next day when I was being interrogated by a forensic investigator.

I figured I was probably going to prison when I saw who it was. Forensic investigators in Canada (or anywhere else for that matter) generally don’t get famous, but I like to watch crime videos and documentaries so I recognized the guy’s face. I’m not going to say his name, but he’s well known primarily for getting confessions from three very prolific, very famous Canadian serial killers. I figured if they were willing to bring him in, on one day’s notice, to talk to me, I was fucked.

The forensic investigator read me my rights and immediately got down to business. This was uncommon for him; usually he started by making nice with the suspect. I didn’t know if it was a good or bad sign that he didn’t even bother trying that with me.

“Do you know an Isabelle Burton?”

“No.”

That wasn’t the answer he wanted, I could tell. He didn’t say anything else, just stared at me silently in a way that compelled me to elaborate.

“Actually, I heard that name. Emma told me.”

“Elaborate.”

“Yeah, right before the police came. Emma told me that ‘it’ killed Isabelle and ‘it’ lives in my backyard. I think. I don’t remember; it was an eventful night.”

He looked confused. I felt like an idiot wasting his time with ghost stories.

“I’m sorry, what is this ‘it’?”

“I don’t know. It’s probably not real.”

“Then why mention it?”

“I don’t know. I’m just trying to tell you all the information.”

The forensic investigator sighed and took a slow sip from his coffee. He was watching me intently, waiting for something. I didn’t know what. Eventually, he produced a yellow Duo-Tang and began thumbing through the papers contained within. He pretended to be casual as he explained the situation.

“The truth is, we found human remains in the woods in your backyard.”

I couldn’t think of anything to say. To accentuate his point, he pulled a photo from the Duo-Tang and placed it on the table with forced nonchalance.

The first strange thing I noticed about the photo was the ground. The dirt was saturated with something. I didn’t know what, but the ground was black, slick, and wet. As if reading my mind, the investigator chimed in.

“That’s blood. Look up, in the trees.”

I obeyed, and immediately wished I hadn’t. I saw a tangled mass of human flesh tied up in the branches. I couldn’t make out which body parts were which, as the photo was in remarkably poor quality and the remains were scattered at least twenty metres off the ground. At first, I didn’t even know what I was looking at, so I looked to the forensic investigator for guidance.

“That’s Isabelle.” He paused to correct himself. “That was Isabelle. You mind telling me how she ended up twenty-five metres above the ground, in what is practically your backyard?”

I spoke desperately and without thinking, which was a big mistake.

“Maybe, uh, the window woman did it?”

“The who?” He was losing patience.

“Emma. Maybe she killed Isabelle, cut her up, threw her in the trees.”

The forensic investigator was actually stunned for a moment by my ridiculous hypothesis. He sat up straighter, as if his very intelligence was threatened by my idea, and continued.

“Don’t lie to me. You lie to me, you go to prison. I’m your one chance at a normal life, and you are blowing it. Do you understand? This is your last chance. How did she end up in the trees?”

“I really don’t know, maybe it was-“

“You’re telling me a malnourished high schooler was able to rip apart a human being, after being missing for months, and throw her thirty metres up into a fuckin’ tree?”

“She was covered in blood, it’s the only logical explanation!”

Something snapped in the investigator.

“No. I don’t think so. I think it’s a little more logical that the able-bodied twenty-something sitting in front of me is a fucking deranged psychopath. Maybe he cut Isabelle up. Maybe he threw her up a tree. Only, even that doesn’t make any sense, because how did she even get up there?!”

He was out of steam by the time his rant was over. He sighed deeply and rested his head in his hands. His next words were almost a whisper, almost as if making up for his loud outburst earlier.

“Emma confessed. She confessed to the crime. But, between you and me, it’s bullshit. It’s all bullshit. And I was hoping you could put some of the pieces together here today. But you can’t. Maybe there are some forces at play here we can’t comprehend.”

He paused, deep in thought.

“Maybe there are,” he continued, “And if that’s the case there is absolutely nothing I can do. You’re free to go home.”

He kept his word; I was free to go. Emma wasn’t, however, and she got life in an institution for the criminally insane. Her confession was almost completely nonsensical, and it made no physical sense, but the evidence of the situation was too damning to let her off the hook. It was a big news story, and the Davidsons were a mainstay on television for the next couple months. They were always weeping about how their little girl was incapable of such a crime.

The worst part is, I think they’re right. I think she was incapable of such a gruesome crime. I think the wrong person got punished, and I can’t even begin to imagine what that means.
