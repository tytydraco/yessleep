Part 1: Conquest  
“Dad!” I called from down the hall  
He continued to stare into the the mirror in the bathroom  
“Dad!,” I called again “The phone!”  
“Right.” he sighed, coming back to reality with each rub of his eyes   
“Right!” he calls back “I got it, finish getting ready!”  
“I've been ready, Dad!” I called back with a laugh  
During this time, not long after I had turned 13, I was still so naive. Some people would have called me slow, but I just had trouble picking up on certain social cues, causing me to have trouble starting and maintaining conversations. I was essentially an outcast, and not in the cool and mysterious way. I was lame.

  
“Who in the hell calls this early on a school day?” my dad asked himself as he rounded the corner into the dining room, grabbing the receiver with one hand and gently unhooking the keys from the rack and sliding them into his pocket with one swift gesture.  
“Hello?” a voice crackles through the receiver “Hello, is this Ronald Nash?”  
I could hear through the phone as I came into the dining room.  
“This is Ron,” he replies “what can I do for you?”  
“Yes this is Catherine from the RootHill Veterans Association,” she spoke, more clearly now that the call had fully connected.   
	  
“should we be expecting you at any of the meetings this week?” she asked.  
“Oh I don’t know about this week,” his dad lied, rather quickly to note “kinda booked, y’know, kid and work.”  
“Well, it felt like we had some breakthroughs last week,” she continued “the other guys are concerned about you, Ronald.”   
“Oh, I bet” he said through a false smile “I’ll try and make it next Friday, okay?” he feigned empathy through gritted teeth.  
“Y’know it's not just the guys,” Catherine said “I miss you too, Ronald.”  
“It’s Ron,” he noted, “I’ll see you Friday.”   
It took a moment of deliberation before he had gently set the receiver back into its cradle, with both of us knowing full well that he wouldn’t be in on Friday. His father had noted that he wasn’t a fan of sitting in a circle and listening to men his age drone about a war they hardly fought and reminisce over limbs that got blown off minutes into a mission doomed to fail from the beginning, it just wasn’t his cup of tea, so to speak.    
“Behind you, Pa.” I said as I sidled past him and hurried toward the counter.  
“Make some toast,” Dad said, “need a quick breakfast before we go.”  
Already two steps ahead, I grabbed the bread from the box and tossed a couple pieces into the toaster before making a u-turn around the dining table to grab the Jelly from the fridge, a nice, boxy new Fridgidaire courtesy of dads new promotion.  
“Apple or Grape?” I asked from behind the door of the fridge  
“I’m feeling Grape,” he fibbed  
“Apple it is.” I chuckled.  
“Oh you little bastard,” he quipped “I’ll wallop you for that one later.”  
“Spread your own jam, man.” I countered  
	  
“It’s jelly, you damn fool.” he said  
“Ha, damn fool.” I laughed  
We finished our breakfast and walked to the front door, Dad grabbing his denim jacket from the rack and tossing me an identical, albeit smaller one. For my dads thirty-second birthday I had gotten us matching jackets with the money from my paper route, the backs of said jackets being stitched with the phrase, “Rock On”. A term I had picked up from the radio and found quite amusing.   
“Are we taking the truck?” I asked  
“Bingo, buddy.” he answered, twirling the key-ring around his middle finger  
The truck in question was a 1972 Dodge Pickup W100, turquoise. It was my baby, despite the fact that the car didn’t belong to me, nor was I old enough to drive it. Dad had bought the truck almost brand new with only twelve-thousand miles on it for $4,250 cash. After some fiddling with the radiator and some adjustments to the transmission, most of which was done by myself as I had the smaller hands, the truck ran like a beauty and sounded like a beast, when pushed hard enough.

  
After a short drive up to the school I stepped out, giving dad a quick hug and running up to meet my friends as Dad pulled away to run the daily errands. Typically Main street was bustling at this time, filled with wives dragging their bored husbands to pick up bread or milk, the men pausing to gander at the magazine rack when the misses weren't looking.

  
I slapped a few high fives and headed through the push doors into the cool halls of eighth grade, definitely not the coolest kid there, and unaware of what would happen in the weeks that followed after this day.

  
After a long day of learning and goofing off, one of those more than the other, me and my friends were out in the school yard playing basketball.  
“Me!” I threw my arms up “Pass it to me!”  
The taller boy ducked around the others blocking the hoop, tossing the ball to me, as I then tossed it up to the hoop, allowing him to sink the winning dunk.  
“Aw, no fair” one of the other boys said “Cam can’t even dunk, who let 'em play?”  
“Your just mad a shorty beat you, Marc” the taller boy jeered  
“Nuh-uh, Ty,” Marco grunted “your mother.”  
“Shut up.” Tyler said, tossing the ball back and walking to the bench.  
Tyler was taller than most kids his age, making him naturally better than the others at basketball, and I liked playing with him because he let me set up some sweet dunks. Although most of the other kids made fun of Tyler for being Jewish, I thought his parents were cool, and they let me stay the night sometimes. So we were basically best friends, along with Marco, who was more of a decent pal.  
“Nice game, chick.” Tyler gave me a slap on the shoulder. Since Tyler was 14, a whole year older than me, he made a point to berate me for it.  
“I ain’t no chick, guy.” I said as I tossed Tyler an apple juice from my lunch bucket.  
“While I ain’t your guy, buddy.” Tylers playful retort punctuated by the swift catch of the bottle.  
Tyler and I had been friends since I’d moved to the town, with Tyler having been held back purposefully by his parents due to them believing that not going to pre-school stunted his learning. Tyler of course believed this to be “bogus”, but he respected his parents too much to say so.  
“I got some magazines, wanna check em’ out?” Marco came up to us.  
	  
“Quit lying, Marc.” Tyler said   
“Yeah,” I added “where would you get any mags anyway?” I Asked  
“I ain’t lying,” Marco grunted. “I overheard my pops saying he was going to stock the shop with ‘em, but they haven’t left the box in his closet.” he confided in us.  
Marco’s father Giuseppe ran the corner store and bakery on Main street “Barone Shoppe & Bakery”, or more so he ran the store while his wife, Lucia, ran the bakery. Marco was Italian but raised in the states, his parents were brought up full Italian and showed it in the way they spoke and carried themselves. All the kids in town would go to the store to get candy or little cakes from Lucy, but most of them stayed to watch her in the kitchen. It was no secret that everybody found her attractive, she was a stunning deep-toned woman with lovely long legs.  
“What's your dad need nudie mags for,” Tyler chuckled, “what with your mom being so hot and all.”  
At this I spat my apple juice all over the pavement of the recess area, doubling down with laughter as Tyler smacked my shoulder and giggled helplessly. Marco, however, was not nearly as impressed, standing there with his brow furrowed and fists clenched.  
“Fine,” Marco spat, “guess I’ll keep these babes to myself.” he opened his worn leather jacket to reveal a magazine stuffed in the inner pocket with the golden word “Hustler” printed on the front, patting it gently with a smug look on his face.  
“Woah.” Tyler stopped and looked in awe.  
“Aw, no way.” I said, having never seen one that wasn’t covered in dirt with multiple pages ripped out, giving the opposite effect and leaving most to the imagination.  
Since school was out for the day and dad would be expecting me back by 4:00, we had roughly an hour and a half to hang out together. Tyler, typically being the one to call the shots, decided for the group what to do.  
“I know a spot.” he said, standing up to his impressive height. “Come on.”  
And with that, we followed him out of the recess area and into the streets, Marco unlocking his bike from around the lamp post and me climbing onto the back of Tylers pegs. Riding up the street, young and free, with nothing more on our prepubescent minds than the woman adorning the pages of that book.

  
What I hadn’t known at the time was that hours before, the former manager of the plastic manufacturing plant my father had worked at had just left town, setting up another domino in this story that I hadn’t even registered. If we hadn’t been where we were, maybe if we had just stayed on that school yard till dark and went home like usual, I probably wouldn’t be recounting this to you now. I’ll be keeping interruptions to a minimum from this point on, but I have one final outside piece of information to give a little more context to this story.

  
Although I put most of this together from what people in the surrounding area had heard or seen, I believe this account to be accurate. 65 year old Oswald Baler, former plant manager and father, never made it to his destination that Friday. His car was found blown up on the side of the highway a 100 miles out from our town of Roothill with his corpse still inside. The only person in the surrounding area to have noticed anything off was a farmer who owned the fields surrounding the state route.

  
According to the farmer, he had begun locking up some of his livestock for fear of rain, as the sky had suddenly darkened and become quite overcast. According to weather reports of that day, rain wasn’t expected till the following week. The farmer had stated that the air seemed to fill with a loud buzzing sound, like the kind one would hear during the summer, when the cicadas are out. He had seen a car in the distance stopped by the side of the road, and a man standing beside it looking up. He had followed the man's eyes to see a darker spot in the already shadowed clouds, stating that it had been about the size of a house. He had told police that the car had seemed to start on its own, with the engine rumbling so loud that he could hear it from his front porch. Suspecting something shady, he ran inside to get his camera, and while rummaging through his closet he heard a loud bang, “Like a bundle of dynamite” is how it was quoted in the police report.

  
Upon rushing outside he saw only the bent, flaming remains of the vehicle. The buzzing had stopped, and he had pointed his camera to the sky to try and capture what he believed had been a freak lightning cloud. The sky had lightened up however, and the spot in the sky had seemingly disappeared. Upon looking up and down the road, the farmer captured an image that most believed to be a fabrication, a hoax, and a downright lie. Moving down the road from where the car had been heading was a large black circle above the clouds, drifting in the direction of the town of Roothill, on a day where the wind was still, and no sound pierced the surrounding area.

  
Most called the man a crazy UFO conspiracy theorist, but the man had never claimed anything extraterrestrial had occurred that day. He said the buzzing came from inside the object, which he called “the hole”, and that it was a sign of the apocalypse. He claimed that blood would rain and the skies would tear open. He claimed that doomsday was upon us.

  
The man in the car was Oswald Baler, my fathers former boss. He was driving to Ohio to see his newborn grandson. His daughter tried to call into town when he hadn’t arrived as scheduled. But no calls went through, and they wouldn’t for a while. Although the world is still very much not in ruin, and the events of what happened during my stay in Roothill are mostly lost to a few conspiracy forums and old news outlets, I figured I would let you know what really happened, how the town of Roothill, Alabama was nearly lost to time.
