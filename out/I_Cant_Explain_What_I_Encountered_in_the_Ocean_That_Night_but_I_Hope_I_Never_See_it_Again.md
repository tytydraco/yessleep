The ocean has always been an important part of my life. I was born in a beach town, and I will probably die in that exact same town, or if I can’t, at least one similar to it. The sea gives me energy; it gives me the strength to continue during my lowest lows, and it makes my highs soar that much higher.

The only thing that matches my love for and admiration of the ocean is my intense and total fear of it. Its vastness terrifies me to my core, and the thought of what lies within its endless depths has kept me awake on many a sleepless night. The ocean is beautiful and fascinating, but it can also crush you with a single flex of its mighty suggestion. There is truly not a force on this Earth that is stronger than that of the sea, and no matter how hard we try, we’ve never been able to fully master Poseidon’s unforgiving domain.

Despite this fear, or maybe because of it, I like to spend as much time in and around the ocean as I possibly can. I learned to surf at a young age, and spent several years as a beach lifeguard during high school and college, but now that I’ve grown a little older and my body has become a bit more brittle, I’ve resigned myself to less demanding ways of appreciating the majesty and wonder of the sea. A few times a year, my brother Tommy and I like to take his boat to a little island an hour or so offshore where we do things like fish, scuba dive, and camp out beneath the stars. I cherished these trips of ours more and more as we grew older. We got through a lot of rough times together by going on our getaways, and I wouldn’t trade my memories of them for the world.

When Tommy called me in tears, barely managing to tell me about how his wife had blindsided him with divorce papers, I knew what needed to happen next.

We got up early that following Saturday and headed down to the marina, where we loaded up my brother’s boat with all the things we’d need for a full day and night on our island. The morning started off a little foggy out on the water. Going was a bit rough for the first stretch of our ride, but the fog burned off fairly quickly as the sun began to rise, and by the time we arrived at our destination, we were looking at nothing but clear blue skies that matched the shimmering water beneath our hull. It was going to be a good weekend; both of us could feel it.

We disembarked from our vessel onto our usual beach and got to work setting up our camp. It was pretty bare bones; mainly just two sleeping bags and a fire pit dug out in the sand. We only bothered using a tent if the weather was going to get extra cold overnight, and seeing as this particular trip was in the middle of a particularly warm summer, we felt confident that our sleeping bags would suffice.

Once our camp was in place, we each gathered up our fishing rods and foldable backpack chairs, and, with the tackle box in my brother’s hand and the beer cooler in mine, we made our way to a nearby jetty. We traversed the length of the loose stone structure and set up our fishing site at the very end; it was the perfect spot to cast off our lines, and thus it had become our primary spot to reel in some big ones over the years. With our lines in the water and our butts in our chairs, we sat there for the rest of the morning, occasionally entering into brief conversations but mostly listening to the soft sound of the tide lapping against the jetty. The salty smell of sea brine found my nose on every gentle whisper of a breeze, which I often washed down with another sip of beer. I recall thinking a number of times about what a paradise this place was; it almost made me forget about that massive gray elephant taking up so much space on the jetty.

We hadn’t talked about my brother’s divorce since the night he told me about it over the phone. The subject felt like a raw nerve just waiting to be bumped, and it created a strange degree of tension between us that I wasn’t used to with him. I knew he’d bring it up if he wanted to talk about it, but part of me didn’t know if we’d be able to return to a feeling of normalcy until we got that much-dreaded discussion off of our chests. In the meantime we continued to converse about things of very little consequence, both of us clearly aware of the thickness in the air around us despite the easiness of the warm summer seabreeze.

“Not a lot biting today, huh?” Tommy eventually said.

“Yeah,” I agreed with a nod, because he was right. As a matter of fact, we had been there for the better part of two hours by that point without either one of us getting a single catch. It was as if all the fish in the ocean were avoiding the little patch of water surrounding our lines.

“I guess what they say about there being plenty of fish in the sea isn’t true after all,” he said with a forced, almost ironic chuckle. “Not good news for me, huh?”

“You don’t need to worry about that right now, man.” I swallowed a casual sip of beer in an attempt to keep some levity to the conversation.

“It’s hard not to,” he said. “In fact, it’s all I’ve been thinking about since the other night.”

I placed my beer back into my chair’s cup holder and turned to look at him now, giving him my full attention. “None of that matters while we’re here,” I said. “All of that shit is miles away from us. So don’t let it get to you, okay? Don’t let it spoil our good time.”

He shot an annoyed frown at this. “Sorry, bro. I didn't realize I was ‘spoiling your good time’.”

“You're not,” I said quickly. “What I meant is to not let it spoil your *own* good time. I’m having a blast out here. The weather’s perfect, I’ve got a cold beer within reach, and I’m spending the weekend with my brother.” I smiled. “What else could I ask for?”

He kept frowning for a few more moments, but this quickly changed from one of accusation into one of guilt, then finally gave way as a weak smile broke through. “I guess not much, huh?” He paused. “Sorry, man. I didn’t mean to take this crap out on you.”

“Don’t even worry about it,” I said.

“No, I'm serious. You went out of your way to spend time with me this weekend and I’m over here being a dick. I’ll knock it off, I promise.”

“You know I’m here to talk about it if you want to, right?”

He nodded. “Yeah, I know. And I will eventually. But it’s like you said: all of that shit is miles away from here. That’s a problem for when we get back to the mainland.”

“Alright,” I said, “but we can talk about it here too if you change your mind.”

“I know,” he said again. “Thanks, bro. It means a lot.”

We remained silent for a while after that. The rest of the morning passed by in a pleasant lethargy. We never wound up catching any fish, but we didn’t need to; the ritual of the whole thing was more important than its result. In the afternoon we gathered up our things, returned to our camp, and threw on our scuba gear for a dive. Once we were fully equipped and ready to go, we waded our way into the warm water from a nearby shore and slowly submerged ourselves beneath the gentle surf. Visibility was excellent; bright sunlight trickled down through the azure sea and granted our eyes access to upwards of fifty feet in all directions. We swam our way to a small kelp forest about 300 yards offshore that we liked to frequent during our trips to the island. The forest was typically home to a plethora of aquatic life that Tommy enjoyed taking videos of with his underwater camera.

I say “typically” here, because on this particular occasion, the forest was completely deserted. The closer we got to the forest, the more it dawned on me that the kelp itself appeared to be the only living organism for miles. We could see no fish swimming about, no aquatic life skirting between the stalks of kelp. My brother and I stopped a couple of yards from the forest. We shared a concerned glance, both of us knowing what the other was thinking despite our inability to conjure words underwater. Sea creatures don’t abandon their homes like this for no reason; and seeing as this particular forest appeared to be as healthy as ever, and as it had been positively teeming with life during our last visit a few months ago, the only explanation that I could come up with was that some sort of predator was making the local wildlife nervous and causing them to hide.

My mind immediately turned to sharks, and I felt myself  involuntarily shudder.

I quickly glanced all around us, looking for the would-be hunters. Tommy, seeming to have a similar thought, did the same; his camera swirled in his hands as he twisted all about in search for any potential attackers. Neither of us saw anything. I thought briefly about turning the dive and going back to shore, but decided against it. Tommy had shown no indication of wanting to turn around, and I wasn’t about to be the killjoy. I wondered if maybe the local sea life was merely hiding just out of sight, and wanting to investigate the forest further, I used hand motions to indicate my intention to my brother and together we began our swim into the waiting ecosystem.

We lowered ourselves into the grasping, swaying tendrils of the kelp forest. Our visibility quickly dropped in here; the space was murkier than the clearer waters outside, and our vision was largely obscured by the undulating curtain of brown and green. I scanned the forest for living organisms, searching for anything that might have been hiding amongst the algae or behind the rocks on the seabed that I couldn't have spotted from my earlier vantage point in the open ocean. I found nothing. The forest truly was an aquatic ghost town. Its usual inhabitants were nowhere to be seen, which meant they all either up and left… or they were forcibly removed.

I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my ears; an indicator that I hadn’t properly equalized. This was strange, seeing as these types of pain usually came with the added pressure of lowering to new depths, but I had been near the bottom of the kelp forest for a good minute or so at this point, which meant any discomfort should have made itself known by now. I used my thumb and index finger to pinch my mask over my nose and tried to breathe out through my nostrils — a common method to equalize and relieve pressure while diving. My ears didn’t pop; the pressure remained, and it continued to  grow worse. I tried again, with similar results.

Soon the pain was becoming unbearable. It was as if some unhearable sound was threading its way through my ears and repeatedly slamming against my screaming brain like an angry, vengeful wave. I looked at Tommy, hoping to indicate to him that I needed to turn the dive, when I saw that he evidently shared in my agony. He had dropped his camera, which now dangled from a cord attached to his wetsuit, and had both hands pressed firmly against his ears. We shared an agonized look as our ears burned with this new pressure. Both of us indicated that we wanted to turn the dive, but neither of us began our ascent. The ache that I felt in my head was now rattling my entire body, preventing me from moving, and I was certain that Tommy found himself in a similar state. It felt like my brain was about to dissolve into messy soup within my skull and escape from my body through my eyes, my ears, my nose, my mouth. At this point I welcomed such an outcome; I looked forward to that sweet promise of relief.

Suddenly the unbearable pressure subsided, and the pain quickly started to fade. My brain stopped screeching with its unspeakable agony, and the entire ocean went quiet. I glanced at Tommy; he too looked to be past his own paroxysm of pain, and was already scooping his camera back up into his hands. We met in a confused stare for several long moments, the only sounds shared between us being our loud, mechanical breaths, and the gentle flutter of bubbles escaping from our regulators.

I heard the rushing sound of disturbed water coming from behind me. I turned around just in time to see the last few bubbles of momentum vanish out of existence. A stalk of kelp rustled gently in the murky gloom. Looking beyond it, I thought I could see more stalks moving unnaturally as if something was disturbing them, but it was hard to tell in that darkness.

Tommy and I shared another glance. Despite his face being largely covered by his mask and regulator, I could see the concern that lived there; I’m sure my own countenance conveyed similar feelings. We both motioned to turn the dive at the exact same time, and together we made our way out of the kelp forest and back toward the island before beginning our ascent to the surface. I expected to feel relief when the forest’s murk was replaced by the clearer waters of the open ocean, but no such sensation came. Instead I couldn’t shake the growing feeling that we were being watched. I glanced back at the kept forest as we swam away, half-expecting to see something there looking back at me, but there was nothing. Or at least I thought there wasn’t; some more unnatural movement amongst the stalks, as if something were retreating deeper into the kelp, worked diligently to convince me otherwise.

Relief and I finally united when I was back on dry land; even so, I was careful to keep a good distance from the water while my brother and I doffed our scuba equipment. Only when we were both stripped back down to our bathing suits and sitting on our chairs back at camp did we finally discuss our experience in the water.

“What the hell *was* that back there?” I finally asked, unsure how else to begin the conversation. “I’ve never felt anything like that in my life.”

“Agreed,” my brother said. “I just thought I couldn’t equalize at first, but then it got worse.”

“What could’ve done that to us?”

“In the ocean,” Tommy said, “probably about a million things. Maybe a boat passed overhead and caused some kind of shift in the pressure or something.”

I didn’t much care for that explanation, but I allowed it to ride for now and moved on. “What do you think that thing that swam by us was?”

Tommy shrugged. “I don’t know. But whatever it was, it had everything else down there scared shitless. All of the other animals were hiding.”

“Hiding, or worse.”

My brother nodded. “Yeah.”

A familiar thought came to my mind, one that felt much less sinister while on dry land than it had dozens of feet underwater. “You think it could have been a shark?”

“Maybe,” he said, “but if it was, it clearly wasn’t all that interested in us. It took off pretty quickly.”

“I guess so,” I said. “Or maybe it was still deciding what it wanted to do with us.”

“It’s possible,” Tommy said. “I guess we won’t know unless you want to go back down there.”

I shook my head. “We only brought one cylinder each, and both of ours are below half. I think we’re done diving for this trip.”

“Yeah.” Tommy and I sat in silence for close to half a minute before he spoke again. Realization dawned upon his face as he once again turned to look at me. “Neither of *us* saw what was down there with us, but I know something that might have.”

He stood up from his chair and walked to retrieve something from amongst our drying scuba gear. When he returned, he held his camera in his hands. “It’s possible I captured whatever it was on *this*.”

I stood up and walked over to my brother, and together we watched the video playback from his camera’s viewfinder. Tommy fast-forwarded through our long swim to the kelp forest as well as our first moments within it, but allowed the video to play at normal speed just as we were both overtaken by the sudden agony in our ears. Video Tommy lost his grip on the camera, which twisted and floated through the water with its lens pointed toward the seabed. As it continued to record, I noticed small rocks on the ocean floor gently trembling with some unseen force as young stalks of kelp shook with an enthusiastic dance. Light clouds of sediment shook to life and slowly fell back to their resting place.

“What do you think is causing *that*?” I asked, pointing to the disturbance on the screen.

“I don’t know,” Tommy said. “Probably the same thing that was rattling our skulls. I’m still wondering if it was a boat going by.”

“You really think a boat could have done all that?”

My brother shrugged. “I’m just throwing out ideas.” 

Our on-screen agony appeared to come to an end, and Tommy turned the sound back on just as his video counterpart picked up the camera. Video Tommy held the camera lens pointed in my direction as he and I shared our confused stare (he clearly was not intending to actually film me; this appeared to simply be the most comfortable position for him to hold the thing while not actively attempting to record anything). The whoosh of bubbles and disturbed water rushed through the camera’s speaker. A moment later I was turning to look in the direction of the sound; as I did, Tommy’s camera was able to see past my torso and into the shadowy kelp beyond. I turned back to look at him, which was when the two of us noticed the concern in each other’s faces before we silently agreed to turn the dive.

Tommy rewound the video to a few seconds before the sound and hit “play”. The same scene played out, but this time he paused it as soon as my body turned to reveal the kelp.

“Look at *that*,” he said, pointing to a spot between the stalks.

I looked more closely at the viewfinder and squinted my eyes. At first I couldn’t make out much amongst the murk and gloom of the kelp, but soon a shape began to form in my vision: the shape of a tail fin disappearing deeper into the darkness. It appeared to be either dark green or blue, but the poor visibility of the water, itself made even worse by the translation of the video playback, made the color difficult to distinguish.

“Maybe it was a shark after all,” Tommy said.

I shook my head. “The tail is horizontal, which means it has to be a mammal.”

“A dolphin, then?”

“Could be,” I said. “The color seems off though, but that could be a trick of the light.”

“I’ve heard that dolphins can use sound waves to stun their prey,” my brother said. “Maybe it got nervous, so it did something similar to us so it could make its escape.”

“Maybe,” I said, “although I’ve never heard of a dolphin doing something like that to a human before.”

Tommy turned off the camera and tucked it under his arm. “Well, I guess we won’t ever know, seeing as the next time we go diving down there, it will most likely be gone. Turns out it was harmless anyway, so I guess it doesn’t really matter.”

“I guess so,” I said, but I didn’t feel nor sound very convinced.

Nevertheless, we allowed the conversation to come to an end. My brother put his camera away and we prepared a campfire, which we then enjoyed for the rest of the day. Our conversation, guided by the compounding effects of alcohol, drifted between a few different topics throughout that afternoon, but they all steered well clear of Tommy’s impending divorce. I doubted he’d bring it up again until after we’d gotten home, but I made sure to not allow myself to get too drunk just in case his own inebriation took him over the precipice of that subject. By the time night fell and we had enjoyed our dinner of beans and hotdogs cooked over the fire, we were both thoroughly exhausted by the day’s activities. The night was decently cold without the sun to stave off the drop in temperature, but we barely noticed this fresh chill by the time we were tucked within our sleeping bags and drifting off into deep, restful slumber.

I awoke in the middle of the night to find our camp had been swallowed by a heavy fog. Sitting up slightly, I looked over to Tommy’s sleeping bag and saw that he was gone. It only took me a few quick moments of groggy searching to spot him a few yards away, partially silhouetted in the haze, walking away from our camp and toward the gently shifting tide of the nearby sea. Assuming that he had gotten up to take a leak, I lowered my head back to my sleeping bag’s cushioned surface.

By the time my eyes had spotted the other silhouette waiting for Tommy in the surf, my brain had already started to whisk me off to sleep.

I vaguely remembered the presence of this figure in the morning, but I immediately wrote it off as a hallucination of my half-unconscious mind. Upon opening my eyes, I saw that Tommy was back in his sleeping bag. I was always the earlier riser of the two of us, and so I wasn’t surprised when I had to wait close to an hour for him to wake up before we got started with our day. I spent that time in quiet contemplation, relaxing as I listened to the sound of the nearby waves. Wisps of the night’s fog still lingered in the air, but it had largely burned away by the time my brother finally returned to the waking world.

Over breakfast he told me that he had dreamed of a beautiful woman singing lovely, enchanting melodies to him all night long. I listened to this in the polite-but-less-than-interested way that most people listen to others recount their more mundane dreams, but in the back of my mind I was secretly worried for him. He was not even officially divorced yet and he was already having fantasies about other women coming to his rescue and resuscitating his poor, broken heart. It was clear that the separation process was going to be difficult for him; I predicted many, frequent trips to our island in the near future.

We spent our morning relaxing on the beach until the early afternoon came, and it was time for us to depart. We considered going for a swim before leaving, but our experience in the kelp forest the previous day had us anxious about reentering the water outside of a vessel; whatever Tommy had captured on camera had not necessarily been hostile in the moment, but we didn’t want to take our chances that it would have a change of heart if we entered into its domain again. So, after a few hours of enjoying the morning sun, we broke camp, returned all of our things to Tommy’s boat, and began our voyage back toward the mainland.

I didn’t know it at the time, but my brother would never step foot on solid ground again.

The start of our trip home was unremarkable. Tommy piloted the boat while I sat with him at the helm. He mostly focused on his task while we talked about nothing in particular, and only offered me the occasional glance to signify that he was still invested in our conversation. Our journey back to the mainland should have only taken an hour or so, maybe less if we really punched it. The trip should have been completely unremarkable.

But then the fog rolled in.

It returned with a swiftness that bordered on sentient purpose. One moment I glanced out of the helm and witnessed clear skies and open ocean as far as the eye could see; when I looked again I found that we were suddenly surrounded on all sides by that hungry blanket of gray. If Tommy, who had kept his gaze ahead for our entire trip home thus far, had noticed the encroaching layer as it had formed, he hadn’t said a single word about it.

I stepped out of the partially enclosed helm and looked around at the suffocating curtain. “Where did *this* come from all of a sudden?”

“I don’t know,” Tommy said, his gaze switching between his boat’s control console and the gray haze ahead of us, “but it’s messing with our navigation. I’ve never seen fog do that before.”

“Think we should wait it out?”

He thought about it, then shook his head. “Nah, I think we’ll be alright as long as I’m careful. It should pretty much be a straight shot back to the mainland.”

“Alright,” I said, “but if you’re ever not sure, just kill the engine. We’re better off not wasting fuel running around in circles out here.”

And so we continued on through the swirling fog for the remainder of that long, quiet hour.

And then for another one.

And another.

The day passed quickly, but at the same time seemed to crawl by with agonizing caution. The promise of dusk loomed overhead, its particulars lost to the fog, but its presence was announced all the same by the increasing darkness that seemed to slowly leak straight out of the ocean itself. Not once did the mainland ever manifest out of the disorientating haar.

“I think we just need to call it for now,” I eventually said as night continued to settle over the sea.

My brother, who had been gradually slowing our forward momentum for the last hour, finally brought the vessel to a complete stop. Though the engine continued to idle, the silence that rushed in to fill the space once occupied by the roaring boat felt eerie and unnatural after hours of listening to such a loud, constant sound.

“I don’t get it,” Tommy said, his voice suddenly too loud after hours of compensating for the boisterous engine. He adjusted his volume as he went on. “It should’ve been a straight shot. There’s no reason we shouldn’t have hit land yet, even with such poor visibility.”

“Maybe we weren’t going as straight as you thought we were,” I said.

“That’s impossible,” he said. The growing frustration in his voice was easy to perceive. “I’ve been paying close attention and I’ve made sure not to drift off course.” He looked at the surrounding fog. “And what is up with this stuff, anyway? Why hasn’t it burned off yet? And why is it messing with our navs like this?”

“I don’t know,” I said in response to all three questions at once, “but there’s no use in trying to fight it. This stuff will probably be gone by morning, and we can get our bearings then. But for now I think we should call it.”

“I guess we don’t have any other choice, do we?”

My brother killed the boat’s engine and dropped the anchor. The silence that was kept at bay by that last hum of noise suddenly swarmed us with suffocating intensity. The only thing that fought back against that overwhelming quiet was the gentle slap of the breathing ocean against our vessel’s hull. We moved from the helm to the deck, where we each sat on our own bench on opposite sides of the vessel (he on the portside, I on the starboard) and enjoyed a meal of canned food and bottled water in silence. Neither of us felt like talking; it was as if the fog that drifted all around us sapped us of our energy, and thus robbed us of any desire to communicate. To do so would simply require too much effort.

Another hour or two, or maybe even three, passed. I didn’t bother checking my watch, and it was difficult to perceive the passage of time while trapped within that fog. I sat on my bench, looking out into the gray, doing my best to try and see through that hanging cloud of condensation. My eyes only made it a few feet before they were lost in that great wall of swirling smoke. It was as if the fog had completely swallowed our vessel, and we were forever trapped within its world of malicious moisture. The only place my eyes could wander where they could see anything at all was to the water below; peering over the gunwale, I looked down into that vast expanse of ocean beneath our vessel, once a shimmering blue in the daylight but now a glassy sheet of endless obsidian in the absence of the sun. Much like the haze, the dark depths of the ocean were largely impenetrable, with my gaze barely making it below the water’s surface before it was completely lost to that inescapable realm of black.

But despite the poor visibility, I was certain that I could see something moving beneath that threshold of brine.

I frowned, taken aback by the sudden suggestion of motion where I expected to see only passive darkness. I shouldn’t have been surprised to see something moving under there — despite our experience on the island, the ocean was filled with aquatic life that had certainly been passing beneath our vessel all day long — but something about what I was seeing now felt concerningly out of place. It was as if the thing shifting beneath the surface somehow wanted my attention; as if it was hoping I would spot its unnatural rhythm. I felt oddly enticed to lean over the gunwale in order to get a better look. Placing my palms against the top of the barrier, I cautiously stretched my upper body out of the boat and toward the inviting kiss of the water. 

I could see the movement more clearly now; I didn’t have a doubt in my mind that there was something swimming all around down there, effortlessly gliding through those endless volumes of water like a bird skirts through the sky. I didn’t know how deep that something was — the almost mirage-like darkness made it difficult to perceive distance — but one thing I knew for certain was that it was getting bigger. It was rising toward the surface — and I was startlingly eager to meet it when it arrived there.

“Screw this.”

My brother’s sudden, frustrated words ripped my gaze away from the water; my fascination with what waited below the surface was immediately forgotten. Turning to look at him, I saw that he was already standing up and making his way toward the helm. I also forced myself to my feet and met him in the middle of the deck. “What are you doing?”

“I’m starting this thing back up,” Tommy said. “I can’t just sit here anymore.”

“I thought we agreed to wait until morning.”

“Yeah, well this is driving me nuts,” he said. “I can’t just wait around for this fog to clear. We don’t even know if it’ll be gone by morning at this point.”

I frowned at him. “We don’t have enough fuel to be wasting it like this, Tommy. You’re only going to get us more lost.”

“I’m *not* going to get us lost,” he said, the tension in his voice rising. He was quickly sounding more strung out and frustrated than I had ever heard him before. “I *know* I was going in the right direction. We have to be near the mainland by now, and I’m not going to stay out here all night if the marina is only a few minutes away.”

“I don’t think we’re as close as you think we are,” I said, “and I don’t think you’re getting us back to the marina tonight.”

My brother scowled at me. “So what, you’re saying that I can’t do it? That I’m not man enough to get us home?”

His words stunned me. He had never spoken to me before with such accusatory malice. I needed a few moments to gather myself before I responded. “Of course not, Tommy. That’s not what I’m saying at all. What I’m saying is that we’re in a bit of a jam here, and we don’t need to go and make it worse.”

“It’s *my* boat,” he said curtly, some of the anger calming from his voice, but with that sharp edge still present. “If you don’t like what I do with it, then you can *swim* back for all I care. But I’m starting it back up.”

I offered him a pleading look. Fog drifted in the air between us, partially obscuring us from each other. The condensation didn’t look to be dissipating any time soon; in fact, it appeared to be getting worse. “I think that’s a very bad idea, bro.”

Tommy didn’t bother responding to me. He made his way into the helm and approached the boat’s command console. I considered trying to stop him, but chose not to. I knew there would be no reasoning with him until he learned his lesson the hard way, and I wasn’t about to risk coming to blows with my brother when he was in such an agitated state; to escalate his anger would not do either of us any good.

It turned out that my intervention wouldn’t have mattered after all. Tommy attempted to turn over the boat’s key in its ignition, but the engine refused to come to life. It sputtered and turned with a lazy half-effort, then fell silent as Tommy released his pressure on the key. I approached the helm and he turned to look at me, confused. “What’s wrong with this thing? Did *you* do this?”

“Tommy,” I said, getting annoyed myself now, “I’ve been sitting out on the deck this entire time. How could *I* have done anything to your boat?”

“Then what’s the matter with it? Why won’t it–”

If he ever finished his sentence, I didn’t hear it. His words were suddenly lost behind the harsh dissonance of a sharp, screeching groan that started low but quickly rose in volume. The sound, which echoed off of the water and resembled the melancholy song of a whale or, eerily enough, the agonized trumpet of an elephant, came and went briefly, but it was powerful enough to set my entire head on fire. Both Tommy and I were forced to cover our ears in a desperate attempt to block out the fresh, agonizing pain. Relief flooded my skull when the sound came to an abrupt end, and silence once again prevailed.

“What was *that*?” I said, sharing a look with Tommy. He only offered me a dumbfounded frown in response.

I rushed back onto the deck with my brother following quickly behind me. Another terrible moan swept across the sea, and struck my head with such force that I nearly fell to my knees in agony. When the second anomaly had passed, I hurried back to the starboard gunwale and looked out toward the sea. The fog stared back at me, its moving curtain of gray almost seeming to taunt me in my helplessness to overcome it. 

My eyes, almost as if drawn there by some unseen force, returned once more to the ocean. I saw that same something lingering under the water again, only now it had come significantly closer to the surface, so that I could just barely begin to piece together its features. The thing was hard to make out, but I could’ve sworn that its slender, squamous body looked bizarrely human-like — even almost *feminine* — from beneath the murky ripple of the swaying ocean. What looked like long, unruly strips of hair stretched from the top of its head and gently undulated just below the surface of the water. It stared up at me with a pair of bright, saucer-like eyes for only a brief, almost imperceptible moment before it quickly darted beneath the boat, instantly disappearing from my view. Despite the rapidity of the creature’s flight, the fragile surface of the ocean remained completely undisturbed. The last thing I saw of the figure was the blue-green hue of its scaly, fluttering tail.

I immediately turned on my heel in an attempt to rush to the opposite end of the vessel, but I was stopped when another low, lonely cry began to vibrate my entire body. This time I actually did fall to my knee, where I remained dizzy and incapacitated for an unknowable length of time. I finally managed to heft myself back to my feet when that cry came to an end, and my swimming brain began its painful recovery.

I barely made it half a step before the sight on the other side of the boat stopped me in my tracks. Tommy stood in front of the portside gunwale, his back facing me, his visage partially lost behind thin strips of fog. Beyond him, rising out of the water barely two yards from the vessel, was a slender, dark figure that was itself entirely silhouetted behind the gray curtain of condensation that continued to smother the air. Its hair-like tendrils continued to flow and twist as if they were still submerged in water, despite the top half of its body having completely breached the sea’s black, glassy surface.

I vaguely heard myself mutter an expletive in disbelief. My brother didn’t seem to notice.

“Get away from that thing, Tommy,” I managed to croak, my voice coming slowly. I took a measured, cautious step toward my brother. “Get away from—”

A devastating wail seemed to rise out from the very maw of the ocean and slam into our vessel with the unfathomable strength of Poseidon Himself. I immediately tumbled to my hands and knees; as I fell, I became certain that by the time my body hit the deck, I would be dead. As it turned out, I would receive no such mercy; instead I slammed into the hard surface with a terrible crash and fell into a frenzy of terrible, unspeakable pain. I wanted nothing more than to crumple onto my side and cover my ears with my useless hands, but instead I somehow managed to force my red, sweating face to once again look toward Tommy. My brother, unaffected by the vomit-inducing screech that had all but robbed me of my very essence, continued to face the silhouette that stared at him from the swirling haar.

“Tommy!” I bellowed with whatever voice I could find. “Get back, Tommy!”

“She’s singing to me.” My brother’s quiet, distant voice somehow managed to reach me despite the concentrated nastiness that occupied my ears and mind. He sounded calm, as if he were at peace; certainly more at peace than I had heard him in a long time. “Her voice is so beautiful…”

“Don’t listen to it, Tommy!” I begged. “Please don’t listen!”

I don’t know if he ever heard me. Instead of answering my plea, Tommy climbed up onto the gunwale, so that the only thing that stood between him and the haze-drenched sea was one short, insignificant step. The figure in the fog continued to cry; it continued to sing.

The last thing I saw before my mind gave out was my brother taking that one final step over the edge.



When I awoke the next morning, the fog was gone. Gentle, young sunlight trickled down from the cloudless sky above. It didn’t take me long to realize that I was alone on Tommy’s boat; my brother, as well as the thing that sang to him, were both gone. I considered immediately throwing on my scuba gear and jumping into the water after him, but I thought better of it. I doubted he would be anywhere near the boat, and to so needlessly put myself at risk wouldn’t have done anything to save my lost brother. In the end I made my way to the helm and attempted to start the engine. It sputtered for a few seconds like it had the previous night, but, much to my surprise, the vessel actually managed to come to life. Everything seemed to be working like normal, including the boat’s navigational systems. Conjuring memories of Tommy teaching me how to pilot the watercraft, I carefully raised the anchor, and after taking some time to familiarize myself with the controls, I took off in the direction that I hoped would lead me to home. I couldn’t find my way back to the marina, but, much to my relief and surprise, I managed to make it to the mainland in under twenty minutes. I had never been so happy to be out of the ocean and back on dry land in my life.

The coastguard never found my brother, despite searching for him for weeks. His death was officially ruled an accident; a demise brought on by a sudden, panic-induced mental breakdown that caused him to hallucinate, and ultimately to jump into the water to his doom. I, thankfully, wasn’t the person who had to break the news to his kids and would-be ex-wife, now widow. I don’t know that I could have handled such a responsibility. I’m not sure I could have stomached giving them the official explanation of what happened.

I never told anybody the truth about that night. In fact, this is the first time that I’ve ever put this story into words. It’s taken me a long time to get to this point, but I’m hoping that by sharing this story, it will help keep others safe. I hope it will give potential victims of whatever it is that we encountered out there on the water a chance to escape from it with their lives.

It took me a long time to go back into the ocean after what happened. Years have passed since then, but I still think of that horrible night every time I’m near the water. The ocean’s sweet melody has been forever tainted by my experience that night. I can no longer listen to it without being reminded of a different, more sinister song — one that I would much prefer to keep trapped deep within my memory of my brother’s last night ever spent at sea.
