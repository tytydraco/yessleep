If someone held a gun to my head and forced me to describe myself, “nice” wouldn’t be the first word I’d use. It would be slouching a few adjectives back, peeking out from behind “I-will-happily-stab-your-mother-for-a-promotion” and “self-serving-to-a-fault”. I mean, what else do you expect? Toss a bunch of power-hungry Ivy League investment bankers into a thirtieth-floor Manhattan glass-front view with the promise of mansions and seven-figure salaries, and you see what happens. My motto has always been this: be an asshole. Get your work done. Stab those backs and take the credit, which all worked pretty well if I do say so myself... until that damn management position opened up.

Associate.

Translation: an experienced monkey supervising the cub monkey analysts, but a chance at some real money for once, and damn if I didn’t want that new electric-red Aston Martin DB11 coupe with the clamshell hood and the custom leather seats. Talk about pulling some serious tail. I could picture it—I’d entice a pack of cocktail-soaked blondes from one of the high-end clubs in Brooklyn with the promise of a nightcap at my place. They’d mutter a “no” but then see the Aston and their eyes would light up with lust. *Wow, this is your car? Sure, your place sounds great.*

The only problem was Cliff Baxter, my knockoff-suit-wearing boss and his annual review. He broke my heart, said I needed to develop my “soft skills” before he’d consider me management material. *Brad*, *you have a lot of potential. No one works harder than you, but you need to learn how to play in the sandbox with the other kids first.* God, I hated his metaphors. Why couldn’t he just say it? Tell me straight that I needed to take it easier on all the fragile millennial egos Gorman and Gorman loved to hire? Well, I decided, if it meant a shot at Associate, I would do it. I would clench my teeth and bite my tongue... and it only cost me everything.

\---

I’d picked up Cliff for a morning presentation we had downtown. A potential corporate divestiture with a hefty commission; big stuff. If we landed it, Gorman and Gorman would profit nicely. I had pulled up to an intersection near Columbus Park—Cliff’s review still stinging fresh in my mind—when I spotted the bum on the corner. An old war vet. *Here it is!* I thought. *My chance to show Cliff I really am a nice guy.* He’d been droning on about the day’s laundry list, muttering about the presentation and some tweaks we’d need to make to the cash flow model, but I wasn’t listening.

My eyes were on the bum.

He had a fog-gray beard tickling his belt buckle, so thick it looked like an apartment complex for bedbugs. He was clad in a set of mangy army fatigues, hems tattered, with a faded American flag stitched to his shoulder. His lower right leg ended in a stump, his pants roped off below his knee. Next to him on the sidewalk sat an overstuffed canvas backpack. When he spotted me looking at him, his mouth split into a checkerboard of missing teeth. He looked wolfish. I almost sped off, but he gave me a friendly enough wave. He tossed aside his battered sign (*SPENT ALL MY $ ON CARDBOARD-N-MARKER)* and crutched his way over to my window. I lowered it, instantly regretting my decision as a cloud of nicotine and BO rolled into the car.

“Spare a few bucks there, cap’m?” he asked, leering first at me then at Cliff, who hissed at me to keep driving.

“Sure can,” I replied in a suitably concerned voice, ignoring Cliff and digging a twenty from my billfold.

The man’s eyes brightened. He snapped it from my fingers with frightening speed... and paused, a strange look rolling over his sun-damaged face. He grabbed my wrist and cried, “It’s you! It’s *really* you, right here in the bloody damn flesh!” He jerked my door open and flung me out onto the sidewalk. I tried to rise, but he squatted directly on my chest, horrifyingly strong as he leaned over and yanked something from the backpack. It was some sort of—my eyes widened. *Jesus*, *no* was all I could think when I spotted the saw blade glinting cheerily in the sun.

“Been waiting for you for a long, *lonnggg* time, junior,” the man said, firing up the saw with a terrifying *whu-whu-whu-eee!* “Don’t be scared now. You’ll be fine! Right as rain after this. Your old man always was.”

Before I could open my mouth to object, he slammed my head to the cement, and my vision ignited with stars. I was vaguely aware of him spinning around on top of me. Cliff appeared through the open door red-faced, screaming as the bum cut into my shin. A brittle snap lit the air, the sound of bone splintering—*my bone.* I howled and bucked against him. It was no use; the man was a bull, pinning me down with his thighs and cutting, and cutting, and cutting until—with a final meaty *pop!*—my leg severed.

And the pain—the indescribable, ungodly pain...

I looked down to a river of blood, and my burnished leather oxford twitching beneath the pant leg of my custom-fit Burberry suit. People scattered in every direction, the scene descending into chaos. “Oh my God!” someone cried. “Call the police! Call nine-one-one!” A plump woman in a flowered dress snatched up her child with a scream, quick to cover his eyes. Briefcases hit the sidewalk. Purses. There were shrieks. More frantic cries for help. My head lolled to the side in time to glimpse a bald construction worker rushing the bum from across the street, a sledgehammer in hand.

The bum spotted him and scrabbled spiderlike for my still-twitching appendage. “No! No! It’s mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!” It was like he thought the guy was about to steal it for himself. And then the strangest thing happened. The vet rolled up the pant leg of his army fatigue to reveal a scarred stump, onto which he jammed—literally jammed—the bloody end of *my* stump. I blinked once, thinking, *this isn’t happening, this isn’t real*, as his flesh twined with that of the severed shin’s, the bones grinding and snapping into place.

A thought crashed through my skull: *what in the actual fu—*

*---*

“—are you *doing,* Nelson? Have you lost your goddamn mind? Get up already.”

My eyes clicked open. I groaned and squinted up at Cliff, who was standing over me with his blue power tie flopped out over his ample gut.

*Oh, God, my leg*. I jerked upright and reached for my shin which was...

Right. There. Attached below my knee and perfectly formed as if nothing had happened. No pants though, no shoe, the skin a smooth baby pink. I flexed my toes, new ones I supposed. They worked perfectly, the lingering pain from my last gout attack gone. I glanced at Cliff with a hard blink. “Wha-what happened?”

Cliff frowned. “‘What happened?’ Seriously, Nelson? Listen, a guy like that has it hard enough without you harassing him. A veteran, even. You should be ashamed of yourself, jumping out of the car like that and scaring him. This is *not* Associate behavior, Nelson. Not. At. All. Now get back in the car. We’re holding up traffic.” It was true. I could hear the horns wailing away, people streaming past us on the sidewalk without a second glance like nothing had happened.

Because, apparently, *nothing* had.

I struggled to my feet and dug the keys from my pocket. Cliff snatched them out of my hand. “Nope, I’m driving. You’re off the presentation, Brad. I can’t have you acting—” He waved disgustedly at my bare leg “—*looking* like that in front of a client. Christ.” He straightened his tie. “We’re going to have a long talk about proper behavior at Gorman and Gorman when I get back. A long talk.”

I nodded, still dizzy, and got in.

\---

A quick visit to Brooks Brothers and I was back in the office, freshly clothed and freshly shamed. I made my way to my desk and flopped down, pulled up a PowerPoint, and stared at it. Bar charts and graphs. Good camouflage. (I’m working everyone. Brad is a hard, hard worker.) But my mind was gone, drifting. It had all seemed so real, so... vivid. No way I had imagined it. No freaking way. I could still feel that saw biting into my flesh, could still see the blood spurting in a bright arterial red from my shin.

My phone buzzed. “Brad,” Ashley the receptionist chirped in her singsong voice, “there’s... uh, someone here to see you.”

“Be right there.” I pulled myself upright, thankful for the distraction, and strolled down the oak-trimmed hall past the other peons pecking at their keyboards, heads down, grinding away. Hit the lobby. Stopped. My jaw unhinged. He was right there, leaning over the desk and chatting with Ashley. The guy from the street. The war vet, his greasy scalp shining. And not just him. Some other guy in a black and gray camo tank top, half his head wrapped in a bandage and drawn mummy-tight over one eye. He had an arm flung on the desk and the other... well, there wasn’t another. It was missing just as the vet’s leg had been missing; *had* being the operative word. His shin, *my* shin, was right there attached to his knee, his foot still wrapped in my leather oxford and working just fine.

*Time to go,* I thought, about to bolt. No way I was staying here, hell no. But Ashley spotted me before I could move. She smiled and fluttered a perfectly manicured hand at me.

“Heya, Brad.”

I froze. She waved again harder—a what-the-hell-are-you-doing kind of wave—and both men turned my way.

My throat glued shut.

The vet flashed his patchwork grin when he spotted me, his pal, the Mummy leaning in and muttering, “That him?” The vet nodded and shouldered past him, appraised me like I was a long-lost frat brother, like he hadn’t just hacked off my leg with a surgical saw a few hours earlier. “Brad, my boy!” he said with a smile that climbed to his ears. “Good to see you, again.”

I took a step back. I wasn’t even sure how the guy knew my name.

“Whoa,” he said, raising his hands. “Whoa.” He gestured at my leg. “You’re fine, ain’t cha? Just like I said?”

And I was—physically speaking… mentally not so much.

“I—uh. How’d you find me?” I asked.

The man’s hand shot into his pocket and returned with a business card. “You gave me this, remember? Out on the street? Told me to swing by later today.” Brad G. Nelson—Analyst. Gorman & Gorman Capital, the card read. It was mine, but I had most certainly not given it to him. And there was no way in hell I’d asked him to swing by. It must have fallen out of my sport coat on my way to the cement. I’d brought plenty along for the presentation.

“Look,” the bum continued, “if this is a bad time, we can always come back later.”

I started to nod—yes this was a terrible, terrible time—but he glanced back at Ashley and said, “Brad here said your shop was going to donate to the Amputee Veterans Association. A sizeable donation. It’s a big, big help, let me tell you. A big help. A lot of soldiers out there need as much assistance as they can get. A lot of families.”

The Mummy grunted in approval.

Uh... what? My mind struggled to keep up.

Ashley’s eyes went large, her lips forming a perfect pink O. She turned my way and shot me a gleaming smile. “Bradley, that is *sooo* sweet. My uncle served in Iraq. Did you know that? I told you that, right?” She aimed her perky breasts back at the vet. “Thank you both for your service. You men and what you’ve sacrificed for our country... it just means so much.”

“It ain’t nothin’, ma’am,” he said with a quick grin. “Just doing our duty.”

*All right, that’s it*, I thought, suddenly pissed at the way she was looking at him. This guy doesn’t get to amputate my leg, stalk me to work, and then lie about a charitable donation to the hottest girl in the firm. I wanted her to look at me like that, in awe, not at some deranged back-alley bum who cuts off people’s legs for kicks. I stormed forward, my finger out and jabbing. “Listen here, buddy, I don’t know what your game is, but I’ve had just about enough of your—”

“Now,” the vet said to the Mummy. The Mummy’s hand clamped over my wrist and slammed it to the desk. The vet wrapped his arms around my chest. They felt like steel bands. I fought. I jerked and thrashed, but I couldn’t move, couldn’t free my wrist from the Mummy’s grip, couldn’t break from the vet’s arms. What was it with these homeless guys and their crazy strength? I worked out five times a week. I could knock out three sets of 225 on the bench, no sweat, but I couldn’t fight off a couple of vagrants?

“Hold him down! Hold him still!” the vet spat. Then the saw appeared. That damn saw. Again. Twice in one day. Lucky me.

It buzzed to life.

Ashley screamed.

The saw split my arm at the elbow, the blade slicing through tendons and bone like butter. A spray of blood misted Ashley’s face and her sweater. She stared at me, her eyes wide and blue through all the red. She blinked and screamed again louder. Me along with her. The Mummy clutched my severed limb with a shaking hand and nearly dropped it.

“Hurry!” the vet ordered. “Get it to your arm while it’s still fresh!”

The Mummy smashed it to his elbow, and once again, I was staring at one of my appendages melding to that of a stranger’s. The man’s good eye widened, and he looked at me flexing his... *my* fingers in wonder. “Thank you. Oh my God, thank you.” He was crying, tears of gratitude streaming down his dirty cheeks, looking at me like maybe he wanted to reach out and give me a solid bro hug.

I was crying, too. But not from gratitude. From pain—pain like liquid fire. I would have passed out, except my stump née arm wouldn’t let me—that’s how bad it hurt. I looked down at it and was dumbstruck to see a stem growing from among all the grizzle. The shoot of a small plant. But it wasn’t a plant. It was (and I still can’t believe I’m saying this) a brand-new arm.

An infant arm at first. Then a toddler’s. A six-year-old’s ready to head out back and toss a baseball around with Dad. It grew with such an alarming speed, I was worried it wouldn’t stop. But then it did. I stared at it stupidly, made a fist with my new fingers. It was an exact replica of my old arm. Except pinker. Bloodier. And the pain was gone. Totally gone. In fact, I felt pretty decent, all things considered. Enough to remember I was pissed. Super pissed. I rushed the Mummy and shoved him to the floor. He clutched his new arm to his chest and scuttled back against the wall, eyeing me like I wanted to snatch it back from him.

“Hey, take it easy, man,” he said, glancing down at the arm as if he might sing it a nursery rhyme or two. “No reason to get rough here.”

*Seriously?* I thought. I’d show him rough, all right. I’d show him just how rough I could get. Before I could, the vet grabbed my shoulder and spun me around.

“Listen, bud, you need to calm—"

I hit him straight in his stupid grin mouth. *Take that!* I thought righteously as he grunted in pain. He flinched back and fingered his lip, held up an arm like I might do it again, which, of course, I was going to, repeatedly. I planned on beating him until I could no longer recognize his face.

“Brad! Stop it! What are you doing?”

I turned toward Ashley with my fist hanging midair. She stood with her hands on her hips, shaking her head as if she’d just caught me masturbating. Worse, the commotion had brought several of Gorman and Gorman’s finest into the lobby, all of them looking at me in disgust. One of them, Pete Webstock—a pasty-faced kiss-ass weasel—actually grinned at me then drew his thumb across his neck with a nod toward the elevator. I followed his gaze to...

Cliff. Freaking. Baxter. His face tomato red, his eyes blinking, taking it all in.

“What in the hell is going on here?” His gaze flicked between me and the vet and then toward the Mummy, who was still cowering against the wall, then back to me. “This your work, Nelson?”

“No, sir. I—”

“He hit him, Mr. Baxter,” Ashley said, cutting me off. “These two nice men stopped by to share some information on their charity when Brad... he, he came over and shoved one of them and then hit the other one!” She sounded like she was about to cry.

“It’s true,” Pete added. “I saw it all.”

“No you didn’t!” I cried. “Are you kidding me?” I gestured at the blood dripping off the desk, puddling on the floor. “Please, Ashley, tell him what happened!”

“Apologies, folks,” the vet said. “Didn’t mean to cause any trouble here. We’ll show ourselves out.”

“Gentlemen, wait,” Cliff said striding past me with an outstretched hand, which the vet hesitantly took. “I’m so sorry for this. Please stop by tomorrow at your convenience, and I’ll be more than happy to cut you a check.”

“Uh, yeah. Okay. Again, sorry for the trouble.”

“Me too,” the Mummy echoed.

Cliff glared at me. “No trouble at all.”

“Wait,” I said. “Can’t you see the blood? I mean, just look at all this blood!” I glanced frantically around the room in search of an ally. “Didn’t any of you see what happened? They cut off my goddamn arm!”

“Enough, Nelson,” Cliff said. “Get your things and get out.”

\---

Outside, I took a final shuddering glance back at 101 Franklin Place gleaming in the late afternoon sun then slumped down the sidewalk in a daze. How had this happened? I was supposed to become a titan of Wall Street. A captain of industry. All I’d wanted was to matter, unlike my father, who’d Mom told me was a nasty drunk with a mean disposition and meaner fists. He’d run away before I was born. I swore I’d never turn out like him.

And, until now, I hadn’t. I’d studied my ass off and graduated with honors from Yale followed by a Master’s in finance at Brown. I’d spent years working overtime at Gorman and Gorman, eating Cliff’s shit like it was cake. And now I’d lost it all to two looney-bin street bums with an amputation fetish? That damn question hit again, hard: had it happened? Really? No, of course not. My worst fears had come to pass. I’d cracked. I’d one-hundred-and-fifty percent cracked. *Face it, Brad*. *You’ve lost your ever-loving mind on this one.*

Box in hand, I trudged toward the parking garage. I knew where I needed to go—straight to the nuthouse, find some swanky country retreat in the Hamptons where I could sip a few Arnold Palmers until I got my shit together. Maybe call Mom if I got around to it, which I probably wouldn’t. By the time I reached my car, it seemed like a pretty good plan.

That’s when something smacked the back of my skull.

\---

So that’s it. That’s how I got here. And by *here*, I mean a gas-fume warehouse somewhere in the meatpacking district. I’m pretty sure I’m close to Hudson Bay. I can hear the boats gurgling past at night when all the bums are gone and it’s just me and the cage and my bowl of dog food. *Yum.*

Bums, bums, bums. I don’t call them that anymore. Oh, no. They don’t like it. They prefer I salute and refer to them by their former ranks: Sergeant. Captain. Corporal. Whatever. I do it, but I still think of them as bums, although it’s hard to do much thinking anymore, what with the daily amputations and all.

The vet filled in the missing pieces one lazy afternoon a few weeks later with the air stinking of brine from the bay. Apparently, my old man never left my mom. He was swiped somewhere near Fort Harrison. Some black box operation to support the troops. *Shit, kid. I only knew him ’cause I got swiped, too. Only I wasn’t the one stabbed with all the needles like your pops. Nah, I was on the other end of the experiment. Saw them cut off your old man’s arms a few times. I got tossed before I got my leg from him, though. I never could stay off the sauce long enough. Anyway, your dad, he escaped at some point. Word is the dumb bastard got drunk and went straight home to plow your mom. They drug him back again and used him up before I could get re-enrolled. You’re his spitting image, lemme tell you. You got his eyes.*

I got his eyes. It’s what landed me in this mess. Pure dumb luck. Oh, and get this, there really is an Amputee Veterans Association. Something I wasn’t too happy to find out about because, ta-da, it’s me! I’m the charitable organization, just like good old Dad used to be. Every day, I’m forced to service a line of grubby, disgruntled veterans looking for handouts, said handouts being my appendages, of course. Days and days of ungodly pain and limb regrowth, rolling around in my cage like an abused dog.

So, yeah, I guess you can say I’ve accepted my fate. There are worse things than helping those who’ve sacrificed so much for our country, though I’ll admit the work-life balance sucks. But—*hey!*—at least there’s some real job satisfaction here, unlike investment banking. At least what I do matters now. Not everyone can say that about their career. And besides, they’ve given me a name I quite like. It almost sounds like I’m a superhero. *Their* superhero.

They call me the Limb Farmer.

Sometimes, I dream of escaping, or I used to, anyway. Not so much anymore. There’s no point to it. No one would believe me if I told them. That’s the other thing the vet said. You had to be in the trials to remember the amputations, something about the nanobots in my blood mixing with the air to wipe bystander memories—America’s tax dollars hard at work!

Still, I can't help but hope. The vet passed out after a bender last night right in front of my cage, close enough for me to snag his phone. That's what I'm using to post this right now. The battery is almost dead, so this is my only shot. If you live in New York, I'm begging you--call the cops and give them this phone number. Here, I just looked it up. It's 555-555-3245.

Please help me. You're my only shot of getting out of here. I gotta go now. The vet is waking up. I hope you can do me a solid and lend me a hand...
