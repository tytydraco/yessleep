Good night dear readers.
I have shared this story many times in person or in discord and every time I’m told it’s a crazy story and recently I was made aware of this subreddit and told it was a story worthy enough to be posted here. So here it goes.

On the summer after I finished high school, i finally didn’t have responsibilities in my life, I could post-pone picking a Uni/College to go to and could just rot. I was 18 now and wanted to stay at home and play games all day, especially SIFU, i was trying to get the true ending without dying (by the end i did get it btw), so i decided “sleep? Who needs sleep? Sleep is for the week!” So I proceeded to purposely stay awake in order to grind away and master SIFU.

All I did was play games all day while my parents were at work, then when they arrived they usually made me stop, and then after dinner time i resumed playing and played deep into the night, however i knew if my parents came down the stairs at 7 am and saw me playing they would be furious, therefore, from 6:30 am till 8 am i switched the tv from PS mode to regular cable and then turned it off and then i went downstairs to my room, where for that duration of time i stayed awake. How i hear u ask? By torturing myself. For the duration of that 1:30 i put myself on the cold hard floor instead of the bed to purposefully be discomfortable to not fall asleep, i did a bunch of other things like being on my phone and having an ice cold pack in my head, but anyway for the next 5 days thats what i did during that time and the rest of the time it was playing games on my PS.

At first not sleeping made me, well, tired and also it made me “see” things in my peripheral, it was more like a figure that every time i tried to directly look at it it vanished, next days i heard whispers, like full on conversations happening behind me of my classmates except i couldn’t clearly hear a thing, and ik, how could i have not connected it was weird for me to hear my classmates at my house in mid summer? Idk< i wasn’t noticing important things at the time. Then i started to have these moments where i “watched” myself go about my day like it was a normal thing to be in “third person”. And dont get me started on how the mirror me wasnt, yk, mirroring me and it creeped me out.

But now heres the thing, after the 5th day I actually stopped being sleepy, I went the next 4 days without even WANTING to sleep, not a single Z felt desirable to me. And if u are wondering, no, the figure, the murmurs, the third person and the mirror did not disappear (unfortunately) but the tiredness? It totally did..

Heres what i think happened at the end of the 5th day. I genuinely think I tricked my body into thinking “ok ive tried to make him tired so he sleeps but he refuses to do so, so maybe theres smth idk about that he does and its urgent we remain awake, so im going to stop trying to fight it and actually help him stay awake”, i tricked my body it was some sort of life or death level of importance situation and it switched gears to keep me alive.  And by the end of the 9th day i think my body was like “ok its been a while and nothing bad has happened i think we are finally free to rest and we are in the clear”, mind u that after the 5th day I actually said fuck this and wanted to sleep but couldnt thats how i found out i couldnt sleep even if i wanted to. So on the 9th day when i had long stopped playing and being uncomfortable on the floor i went to sleep without realizing and apparently slept an entire day and my parents tried to wake me up for dinner but couldnt. 

Im no sleep expert, that theory of me genuinely making my body force itself to stay awake is just that, a theory, A SLEEP THEORY!….
If anyone can explain it to me I would be much obliged . Tyvm
