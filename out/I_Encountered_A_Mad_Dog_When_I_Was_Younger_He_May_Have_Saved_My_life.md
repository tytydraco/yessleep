I needed to mature fast after my mother passed away. My father took me and my little brother in. I was the one who got us ready for school, walked him to the bus, and every morning I would get to class on time. Planning meals with a limited budget was tricky. I made sure my little brother always had at least two meals a day. I wish it were three but the money simply wasn’t there. Due to scarifies my body didn’t grow properly. I was thirteen but appeared to be nine.  

My father was rarely home. That suited me. One night he packed us in the back of his truck. It smelled terrible. I knocked aside fast-food bags jealous he was eating something we rarely got. This drive was different. He didn’t tell us where we were going. My brother was only six but he was smart enough not to ask questions. We drove for a long time. I felt sleepy but refused to drift off. Was he finally tired of us and decided to dump two poor kids at our aunt's house? I dearly wished that was what happened that night.   

He parked outside of an old rundown apartment building. I carried my sleeping brother as a pair of men outside eyed us. An urge to run started in the back of my mind. Soon I was being forced inside, the hallway reeking of old cigarette smoke. The walls of the long hallway were stained over the years and trash littered the ground. My arms burned from the strain but I refused to let go of the only family member I cared about.   

We were led inside a dark room. Two men waited for us smoking in chairs across from a couch. I was shoved towards the empty seat. Carefully I put down Noah. He slept like a rock unaware he was no longer in the truck. I sat down next to him holding his small hand and studied the room. Aside from a table and the chairs, there was no furniture. I’ve never seen the other men before. My father appeared stressed. It was a new expression on his face.  

“Are they good?” He asked the two men.  

The younger one nodded towards the older man lighting another smoke. His grey hair was pushed back out of his face. I didn’t see his expression well in the dim light until he leaned over to study us. My skin crawled with his eyes on me. I swallowed hard fearing the real reason why we were there.  

“Good enough.” He said in a deep voice that sounded like he had smoked a pack a day since he had been born.  

The other man called for someone to bring in a bag from the other room. It landed in front of my father’s feet with a heavy thud. The zipper was half undone so I saw stacks of bills inside. A piece of paper was sticking out of the bag. He snatched it up quickly signing the bottom. My mouth grew dry. I knew what just happened. The man I once called a father had sold us. I was too scared to even protest. The room swam. This couldn’t be happening.   

“There. Signed. I’m out of here.” He said and dropped the paper to lift the bag.  

“Thank you. Oh, also one more thing.” The younger man said making my father pause.  

With one swift motion, he pulled out a handgun and then fired once. A body collapsed to the floor. The sound woke my brother who started to tear up. He was confused and scared in a new place. But I was glad he didn’t see what I just did. The person who brought in the money walked back into the room again to retrieve the cash. My heart was beating out of my chest as I stared down at the lifeless body of the man who had just tossed us away.  

Laughter started to fill the room. The smoker sounded like he had just watched the funniest thing he ever saw in his entire life. Within seconds we were grabbed by another stranger to be dragged away. We struggled, screamed, and cried. Our efforts meant nothing. We were manhandled into a small apartment with the door firmly locked. No matter how hard I pounded I could not get it open. I cursed my small body and I cursed my father. He got himself killed and now no one could save us.  

Noah was crying hard. I needed to focus on him. I couldn’t do anything else. He was confused not understanding what just happened and I couldn’t explain it to him. I guided him to the small bathroom to get cleaned up. I didn’t dare risk using the dirty tub. Instead, I found a somewhat clean cloth to wash away his tears with warm water. Noah always acted much younger than he was in stressful situations. He was lucky that no one bullied him at school and he had a lot of friends. He kept asking me when our father would take us home. I had no answers and couldn’t even think of a lie.  

There was a somewhat clean bed out in the main room. I checked it over for stains before I let him lay down for a while. We could do nothing but wait. I did look around for anything I could find to use as a weapon.   

Back then I vaguely knew what an older man would want with a child. Bile rose to my throat with those thoughts. I would rather die than let anyone hurt poor Noah. He had already gone through enough in his short life.  

The door opened a few hours later. My brain had already thought of a thousand different horrible possibilities. I decided to be the one to make the first move. I charged at the man, teeth, and nails out. Latching onto his arm I tried doing as much damage as possible. He didn’t even flinch. He easily took the back of my shirt collar to lift me off my feet and place the rabid child at the foot of the bed. He looked at his scratched arm with a raised eyebrow. In his other hand were a few bags of fast food.  

“Good effort. Here, I got some Happy Meals for you two.”  

He offered the food but I refused. Noah woke up from the noise and crawled behind me. I knew he was starving but smart enough to take anything from a stranger.  

“I’m not going to eat that. You drugged it so you could do who knows what to us.” I snapped.  

He still held out the bags while putting a hand on his hip. He wore a button-down dress shirt with the collar undone and grey pressed pants. If it wasn’t for his unkempt hair, I would have assumed he had a somewhat respectable job.   

“I don’t need to drug you two to do anything. You’re tiny. Like bugs.” He raised two fingers in front of his eye pretending to squish us.   

I scowled hating how true his words were. As a sign of good will he reached in the bag to pull out a burger. He ate it in two bites trying to prove he hadn’t drugged the meal. I can’t explain why, but I accepted the food. There was something about his expression and tone that made me trust him. He appeared so much different than how he acted in front of the others. I should be weary of him considering he had bought us. And yet I let Noah happily eat the offered Happy Meal. He sipped at his milk offering me some. I refused knowing he needed it more.  

“What are you going to do?” I asked as I picked away at the fries.  

“Nothing you assumed I was.” He commented.  

I narrowed my eyes trying to see if he was lying. But what was the point of making us get our guard down? He was right about easily being able to overpower two small children.  

“Finish your dinner, then we’ll talk.”  

I watched him find a chair on the other side of the room to sit down. He flipped through some old newspaper to read passing the next few minutes. It was nice to have a full meal in my stomach. It would help me face whatever was going on. Noah soon fell asleep again. It had been a long time since he last got to eat so much. I made sure he was comfortable then got off the bed to face the stranger.  

“What’s your name?” I asked him trying to sound like an adult instead of a child.  

He had his chin on his palm, his grey eyes studying me in a way I didn’t like. For a moment he appeared old. Not just like the middle-aged man his body was but something far greater than anything else I’ve ever come across.   

“Graves.” he finally said.  

“Lame.” I replied rolling my eyes.  

He laughed not offended by my comment. For some reason I felt like if I asked questions, he would treat me like we were equals. I rarely came across adults that listened to my questions let alone gave answers.  

“Why did you buy us?” I got down to the most important part.  

“Your father was in deep with a little gang. They wanted to use my services to take care of a rival leader problem. I cannot act unless I am given permission by a human and if I’m paid for my work. I asked for a child or two. Your father just so happened to have just the thing. He was fully paid fair and square.” he shrugged speaking as if he was talking about the weather and not what led to my father’s death.  

I huffed with my arms crossed.  

“Ok, but why do you want some children? Are you going to like, eat us?” I said sounding brave but deep down praying that wasn’t the case.  

He paused and then reached into his pocket to pull out a Happy Meal toy. I had noticed one missing. It wasn’t my main concern so I didn’t bring it up.  

“I wanted this. But do you know how embarrassing it is to get the toys when you’re not buying the meals for some kids? I swear the workers just know. I could never live it down.”  

I stood stunned at his answer. He must be joking. He had to be. Was my father really killed over a stupid rivalry and a small hunk of plastic? He had never been a good man. I never expected him to change his ways. No, I wanted to be the one to ruin his life. To see him rot for what he had done to us. It felt like he had gotten the easy way out. I shook my head needing to put that all behind me to address a different important point.  

“Are you...?” I started but found it impossible to say the next few words.  

Somehow, he understood what I wanted to say. A slight white light came from his pupils as his face sank deeper into darkness. This man was not human. That fact should have been hard to accept yet I did so right away. He still had plans for us and I dreaded what those could be. I was scared of him. It felt like the eyes of some ancient beast were staring in my direction. Suddenly I found it impossible to speak. My body froze when he stood from the chair. With three steps he shortened the distance between us, his hand out to take hold of a scared prey.   

I simply could not move. Everything happened in slow motion. In a hard movement, he grabbed my arm and tossed my small body aside. Sprays of blood came from his chest as a clawed hand exploded out of his flesh. He was tossed across the room, landing in a heap in the small closet.   

My heart was beating like a jackhammer when I saw the next threat. It wasn’t even remotely human and it didn’t try to hide behind a mask like Graves. It rose from the floor coming out inky black shadows that appeared. The body looked to be an ever-moving body of a centipede with human arms. Each hand had clawed fingers perfect for ripping apart flesh. The face had been stolen from a long-ago victim. The flesh was crudely stitched over a horrible insect shell. When it spoke, the mouth stayed shut but the cheeks moved as if it needed a tongue to form words.  

“Little one, little one, come to me. Let my hands feel your flesh. Let my mouth taste your blood. Come join all the others in my stomach.” It said sounding far too serene for a creature with such a gruesome appearance.  

I took a few steps back trying to think of what to do. This thing may reach Noah before I could. I might make it to the door and freedom if I gave up my sleeping little brother but could I live with myself after? No, I could barely stomach the idea. I needed to buy time.  

“What... are you?” I asked voice shaking as much as my shoulders.  

“A protector. Protect from death for little child flesh. Easy deal. Good deal. Tasty for me. Now, come here.”  

It waved so many hands trying to get me to come closer. I shook my head cursing my small body yet again. I needed to think of something and fast. When I refused to go to the creature, it came to me. It sprang to life, all those hands so close to pulling me apart. I screamed for help praying a higher power answered.  

The man who answered my plea was someone I thought had died in front of my eyes. Graves got between us and punched the creature so hard in its face that it crashed into the drywall on the other side of the room. His wound healed leaving his clothing bloody and torn.  

“Sorry, Little Missy. I’m old, it takes me a minute to get back up.” He said with a small wink over his shoulder.  

I felt my face grow hot. My hair was short and I wore boy clothing. I didn’t have any feminine traits however Graves saw something most didn’t. The creature recovered appearing more annoyed than injured.  

“Nasty, nasty. No fair. No deals were made. I listened. You cannot harm me. The human has not permitted you.” The creature hissed.  

My muscles tensed again as worry flooded my system. Did I have enough time to make a deal with him before this monster attacked? A smile appeared on my savior's face that shocked a bolt of fear down my spine.  

“I only need permission to kill humans. You're a monster like myself so it’s all fair.”  

He took a step toward the creature. It curled its large body inward the head darting around looking for a way to escape. It started to make promises, deals, anything to make Graves back off. The shadows that the monster lived inside turned on him. The room grew dark around us as countless glowing eyes appeared. Each pair of white specks belongs to the dead. Half-rotten animals emerged from the shadows, their mouths showing teeth ready to feast.   

They paid no attention to me as I rushed over to pick up Noah. He was limb in my arms which worried me but he was alive. I needed to feel his warmth while being surrounded by countless dead. They all fell on the monster at once. Dark blood came from it as each arm was ripped away. It cried for mercy that did not come. Graves watched his face twisted in a way that made him appear like a beast. His form started to warp as dark grey smoke poured out from his back, dark rotten faces flickering inside the mist. Slowly he was transforming into a creature more terrifying than the centipede the dead was ripping apart.  

“You? What is this? How??” The monster cried out looking for answers. It paused struggling as if someone spoke the answer. “Mad Dog? No, no! Free me! Do not take me! I have done nothing to you!”  

The air in the room grew harsh. It was as if the room was closing in on itself. Over the screams and sounds of the dead creatures, I heard random shouting coming from downstairs. Faint gunshots came that soon got louder and louder. Something terrible was happening in this entire building. I found it hard to breathe. My lungs closed up as my body thought I was a moment away from death. The man in front of me was not the same person who brought two scared kids dinner. No, he had become something far too dark to understand. If Hell was real, this may be what it was like.  

I wanted to leave. To go home no matter how terrible it was there.  

“Graves...” I said in a weak voice.  

I could barely see the man he was before underneath the monster that was taking over. This beast was enjoying making the other monster suffer. He had the power to ensure not even death could give it a release.  

“Dad...” I broke my voice almost lost in all the noise.  

The monster in front of me caught the word. He turned, the dark expression disappearing from his face. For just a moment, his appearance was different. He looked human. The tiredness from before disappeared leaving a gentle expression behind. He said a word that I didn’t understand. Something sounding long forgotten. Maybe a name. All at once he switched back to being Graves. He raised a hand causing the dead creatures to drag away the monster somewhere else. The sounds of the fighting outside the room were still going on and getting louder.   

A large grey wolf appeared, the fur covered in dirt and blood. Half the face had rotten away exposing the skull with two glowing white eyes. Oddly enough, I wasn’t afraid of it. Or when Graves walked over to lift me Noah on the back of the beast.   

“What’s going on outside?” I asked holding onto my little brother tightly.  

“The leader of this building hired that monster to protect them. But the cost became too steep. It started to demand more children to consume, so they turned to me. He hired me to kill the leader of a rival gang, as you know. I did so, but only killed the leader. I also let slip that I was taking care of a certain pest that had given them so many problems recently.” He explained with a lazy smile on his face.  

He planned this. All of it. He used us to lure in a monster and to, what? Have some people kill each other? For what purpose? Did they piss him off in some way?   

“Are you... a good person...?” I said wondering what would happen to us now.  

“Of course not. I did not kill that monster to save future victims. I took it down because it disrespected the dead. Simple as that. The same goes for all these people tonight. Some of them are like you. They were poorly raised without any chance of having a better life. If given the right opportunities they might have become something better. The good, the bad and the monsters are all my prey. All of these humans disrespected me by wasting away their precious lives. I don’t care about the reasons why.”  

I let the words sink into my brain. He sounded like a monster and acted like one. Who knows how many people he’s killed. And he was the reason why my father was shot dead that night. But still...  

“You drugged the milk.” I said and nodded towards Noah.  

He laughed realizing he had been caught. Even monsters can have an act of kindness once and a while. Because of that, my little brother would not have to see the horrors of that night.  

“I’m still a nasty creature. We need to get you out of here. I had hoped to do so before the fight broke out. As you know, I can’t kill humans unless I get permission and paid. So, I can’t protect you kids.”  

I looked at the door trying to hear how bad it was outside. There were still bursts of gunshots. We could risk leaving but we may catch a stray bullet.   

“I can make a deal with you.” I offered.  

“Pretty horrible of me to let a little girl have blood on her hands.” He commented.  

Yes, it was. By asking for his help, he might need to kill someone so we could get out safely. If there was a God, he may condemn me for this. I didn’t care. I would do anything for Noah.  

“I don’t have anything to pay you with...” I pointed out.  

Since I was sitting on the back of the wolf, we were at eye level. For a moment, that kindness returned to his face. He reminded me of my father when I was younger and when Noah was first born. For a short while he had loved us only for that to be taken up by his greed.   

“I’ll protect you two until you get to your aunt's place in exchange for one thing. Little brothers can be annoying. In the future, he’ll do things that will drive you up the wall. But promise me that no matter what, you’ll still love him.”  

Tears came to my eyes. I nearly broke down. I needed to be strong for a little while longer. I nodded, agreeing to his terms. He waited until I rubbed my eyes of tears then turned toward the door. His beast-like form returned. He wasn’t the kind person who saved us. No, he was a creature that was about to take joy in ripping apart anyone who threatened us.  

The wolf burst through the door. It was hard holding on and Noah at the same time. It was a tight fit. The wolf carrying us smashed through corners, taking out parts of the building and knocking aside anyone we came across.  

It burst through the front doors, glass, and steel exploding into the street. We moved much faster once we were on the road. It was still dark outside yet the few cars we did see didn’t notice the undead creature racing past.  

We stopped in front of a house I’ve seen a handful of times near daybreak. The wolf laid down to let us slide down its back. I carefully put Noah on my back. I nodded a small thanks to the creature. It returned the gesture and then ran down the street with an insane burst of speed.  

I knocked for a while until my uncle answered the door. He was half asleep stunned to see children he didn’t recognize at first on his porch. After he let us inside, I started to learn that they had been looking for us. They wanted to adopt us after my mother died but my father took us away for the government checks. Finally, things appeared to be getting better.  

Over the years, I realized Graves was right. Little brothers could be a handful. Noah didn’t remember the events of that night so the trauma didn’t have any weight on his life. No matter what kind of trouble he got in I was still thankful I had him. I didn’t need to put any effort into keeping the promise I made. I simply would love him no matter what.
