For anyone that missed yesterday

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/e372mjAIR1



I can't tell if you guys are cold as ice or just looking out for me, but wow, leave the guy? 

Honestly though, probably the best decision.  I was debating on telling you this, but hey, who else can I trust. 

I wasn't completely honest with you guys in my last post. I did really hope for that guy to take care of this problem, but I had some other…feelings about the situation. 

I don't know why, but watching him get hurt made me giddy, energized, and I have no idea why. Was I a sick bastard before this? Something from my creator? Something else? No idea, but it makes me want to remind folks , essentially I'm a sentient weapon. And I'm somewhat scared I have less control over my actions than I think. 

Another major devolopment, it's 2024!? I know I should have picked up on this earlier, but I type this stuff randomly late at night , using every sense I have to avoid getting caught. 

I knew I missed some time, but I was thinking we were in the late 90s by the startup bios information in the computer. But 2024? 

I don't have memories about the guy I was made from, but I do have knowledge of basic world facts and a handful of trivia. This all ends in about '93. 

I have no clue if this means anything, but why such a long gap? 

Other than that errata, I'll tell you how my little trip outside the home went. If you are pressed for time the cliff notes version is, it was odd. 

For everyone wondering about the hero, he's still alive, barely. I spent a couple days trying to write a note or something to slip to him, but God,  these hands I have are not made for detail work. Illegible doesn't begin to describe the scrawl I made. 

So I decided it was time for a little trip outside the house. Some of you had a few good ideas for intermediate equipment till I get the trunk open, and the first step in that is doing a little recon of the area. 

Luckily there is an easy way to the roof from the attic , so getting out didnt require too much effort. Getting down, was a bit harder, but the old lattice on the back wall held my weight with only minor protest. 

Looking around though…wow. I'm going to have to explain. 

My creator has cut corners making me, but has put in enough safeguards to at least make sure I get a chance to get my mission, twisted as it may be, done. 

What I saw when I looked around were large swaths of my vision taken up with what looked like massive black  infinitely extending stalactites , stalagmites and webs of all shapes and sizes. Blocking streets, houses , and even just random paths. 

A competent creator would have been able to give me various extra senses, or organs to make sure I wasn't seen, or captured. Mine…chose a quicker and dirtier route. 

Those voids represent the lines of sight and hearing of things likely to take umbrage at a sentient doll. They pulse and shift , showing whatever spell is driving them is not very exact. And I physically cannot cross them. 

I see a moderately clear path to a home I can actually see and decide to make my way there. I make my way there in a series of jerking,  non ergonomic movements, avoiding thin webs of void by ducking, twisting and contorting myself in ways no human could. 

As I look into the distance I notice more and more void until the horizon is just a vantablack sheet. I'm guessing I have a maximum range of some form. 

I take a moment to think how disturbing my movement would look should anyone be able to see me. Not that I'd make a very comforting sight walking in any fashion. 

I easily climb the  fence leading into the back yard, I hear no one in the home and I start to crawl my way up to the garage, hoping to find some tools , or a firearm I could take back to begin a stockpile. 

I must have been too concerned with wedging my way between the sight lines , as I only noticed the heavy breathing once it was 25 feet away. 

A thick built bulldog easily matching my 90 pounds stands there growling. I have no time to think about the situation as it charges me. 

I force myself through the void webs as fast as I can , the dog inches behind me. And I almost make it to the fence before it clamps it's massive wizard sleeve of a face onto my leg. 

No meat in there thankfully, and for all her faults the creator did give me enough reinforcement to deal with something like this, it's not going to be removing any of my parts. 

That being said, leverage, momentum and I'm guessing steroids are letting it toss me around like a, no pun intended, ragdoll.  

Intentionally or not, it starts to slam me against the fence. That, hurts in a hurry, I feel the shock in the fleshy parts of me as I'm slammed over and over again into the solid wood. 

Animal lovers skip ahead a couple parapraphs . 

I try and get one of my blades out, but find out they must be more mechanical than mystical. As I get slammed into the wall the mechanism that retracts them keeps engaging , making them next to useless. 

So instead I go caveman, no tools, no mercy. I reach out, and sink my ceramic fingers deep into the dog's eye. They might not be made for caligraphy, but they do this kind of work just fine. 

My momentum tears the eye from its socket and the dog howls in pain,  launching me in a high arc over the fence followed by a thin spray of dog blood and ocular fluid. The void webs hit me as hard as any real obstacle and I go on a spinning, erratic path, bouncing and tumbling as I land. 

I try to stop myself but I'm in a supremely uncontrolled landing , going down a hill judging by the fact I seem to be gaining speed instead of losing it. 

I can't get my bearings until I slam to an instant stop against a massive tree. I'm physically fine, but have no idea where the hell I ended up besides quite a ways into a scraggly forest. 

I look around,  trying to find a way back to my attic , but between the trees and the void webs , I can see just about nothing past the treeline. 

I attempt a series of frustrated cursing, it's  expressed as a series of gurgles , growls and clicking noises. 

I pick a direction and begin to walk, figuring , even at my stature this forest cannot be that expansive. The branches and litter are thankfully less of a pain in the ass than the void webs, but being 3 foot something and mostly head doesn't make for an easy time navigating undergrowth.  

I hear something in the distance , muffled noises, leaves rustling, branches breaking. My original idea is that I've found a couple of folks engaged in a semi public tryst. Thinking to follow them out after their congress I make my way toward the sounds.  

What I saw was most certainly not folks getting ready to bang. 


2 sentient things stand in front of me after a few minutes of walking toward the noises. 

1 is a rather non descript man, mid 20s , curly hair, and trying his best to scream while being held by the face by the second entity. 

It stood 9 feet tall, lanky, pale, with clear red claws that would give hunting knives feelings of inadequacy . It's face looks long and featureless at first, but as I look close its features are just moved significantly low on its face. Eyes starting where a mouth would be, and a thin massive set of lips starting right below its neck. 

It wore a torn and faded brown suit that covered maybe halfway down its limbs, and left vast swaths of its pale flesh exposed. As it moved, it appeared to leave smoke trails, but instead of dissapating , it fell , snow like to the ground. For some reason it reminded me of cotton candy. 

"The hell? " it says in a suitably dark and breathless voice. It's head turns 180 degrees to face me. 

"For the love of… are you a golem or a homonculus?" It asks me. I fall to the ground doing a perfect imitation of a normal doll, albeit too late. 

"What? I just watched you do that.  I know you're alive." I stay still for another couple of moments, bluffing. "For the record, I'm embarrassed for you ." He finishes. 

I give in,  standing up and brushing myself off. 

"Golem, I think." I say walking over. The man the massive creature is holding starts to scream louder as he sees me enter his already fatal situation. 

"You think? What kind of answer is that? Is there a chunk of flesh in there, and if so is it human?" He seems a little annoyed but not aggressive. 


Something hits me. 

"How did you just understand me?" I say accidentally avoiding his actual question.

"How did I not? You have a bit of a construct accent, but it's English. Seriously though, you have some human chunks in there? Kind of time sensitive here." He says, gesturing to the man he is holding. 

"Yeah, brain, eyes, some muscles, about 90 pounds ish worth." I say tenatively. 

 "For Christ's sake…well first off that makes you a homonculus, not a golem. Which makes what I'm doing here just fuckin useless." The elongated creature puts the man down. 

"Okay buddy, you are probably the luckiest person on earth. You see that little guy? He just made eating you useless to me. I could kill you, but honestly it's a time waster at this point. So I'm letting you go. Now if you get any cute ideas about telling folks about this, or coming after me, I want to show you something that will make you think twice before taking that course of action." At this point the suit wearing thing grabs the man's arm and twists, the bones splinter and pop out at random angles in a burst of fat and blood. 

The man screams for a second before the creature puts it's face inches from his, silencing him simply by placing one razor sharp crystalline claw on the man's lips . 

"You humans have short memories, and chances are after a few months you'd have done something stupid. But remember how this felt, how easily I broke you, but more importantly, after you eat this," the creature produces an old looking hard candy in a red and green wrapper. " And your flesh knits itself better than any surgeon could, remember that is the least of my power. I don't need to rend you, I could tear your body and soul apart from across the fuckin world if you piss me off. Now, run!" It finishes roughly shoving the man away. 

The man doesn't look back, and within a few seconds is lost within the forest. 

"So, what brings you out here ruining my dinner? Name's Kaz by the way." The creature  says taking a seat on a fallen tree. 

I know this might not have been the smartest thing to do, but I told him the entire story, as much as I physically could anyway. He could probably destroy me if he wanted to, and didn't seem to desparate for details so I figured I could trust him. 

"Okay, and after all that your plan is  to try and, what , be some kind of nice guy? Why?" Kaz says amused and shaking his head. 

"Why not? " I say, as a choking cough. 

"The fact you literally run on killing innocent folk? See if you were a golem, you could screw off , go set up a donut shop in Alaska with the right plan. But you, you've been given a little more energy than your job requires, but after that, barring some maintenence,  you burn out if you don't get some notches on your blade. And in your case they need to be innocent, and preferably kids." Kaz lights up a cigarette. "Which is ironic considering the dumb ass legends centering around my breed. " 

"I'll cross that bridge when i come to it. Besides stature, nothing stopping me from taking out the things in my house." I say with unearned confidence. 

"Someone was listening to a podcast when they made you weren't they? I got no love for malignant though, that's the big things that priest is bringing in. What he is? God, no idea, probably just some try hard human who is fuckin around with the void. But if he thinks he is going to control those things forever, he's an idiot. 

I don't want to get involved, but I have some advice. 

The guy in the basement , we call them heroes , they are mysterious , but they tend to have just a little touch of the void themselves. Explains that leg of his, probably made it himself.  You want to buff up? Kill him and kill him slow. 

And, take this, meeting place for our kind, the Flea Market. If you can't find something there for pest removal you just didn't bring enough to trade. " he gives me a gold card with an adress on it. 

" Can I ask you for one last favor . A ride home, for lack of a better term?" I say raising my hands like a toddler. 

He sighs as he picks me up, we both remain silent as he drops me into the backyard of the house I'm tethered to for the next decade. 

A quick climb and I'm back into the attic doing my best to remove the dirt, blood and debris from my clothing. 

I barely get 5 minutes before I hear the screams of multiple people from the basement. 

I'm beginning to know every twist and turn of the vents, and am down , silently, and quickly enough to see the giant malignant drag two people into the room where the hero is still tied to the chair,  clinging to life. 

The bishop follows close behind, a massive rotten toothed grin spreading on his face. 

"You thought i wouldn't go looking for your backup kid?" The bishop says shaking his head. 

The two people look to be in their mid twenties, twin buff guys dressed in camo pants and black shirts. They are badly beaten , but still alive. 

"We're sorry man, he came up outta nowhere. " the one on the left says to the hero. 

The bishop cracks one of his tentacles like a whip and a massive strip of flesh is flensed from the chest of the twin that spoke. 

"I'd say shut up and I'd make this easier, but I won't.  Talk again and I go after that mother of yours in Hammersmith you think is safe. 

Choir boy, you've been here before haven't you? Two friends, you helpless, me having the time of my life. But you thought this time would be different,  you and your special leg." The bishop laughs long past the point of humor. 

"I'm not dead yet. "The hero says staring at the ground. 

"But you know what's coming, and that's even better. 

So, same choice as last time. Do you do it or I do it?" The bishop slowly draws out this sentence as his rictus grin spreads further than humanly possible. 

"Same answer as last time, go fuck yourself, with a side order of, you better kill me. You wood boot, horse meat eating, tulip fucker." The hero says, his gaze never leaving the floor. 

"Thought you would have learned by now . Very well, but you get to watch."  The bishop says as the giant malignant walks behind the hero. 

It yanks his head upward, and with 2 massive fingers pulls back the hero's eyelids until drops of blood start to drip from the torn sides. 

The bishop starts to chant in a language that speaks to that eldritch , unatural part of me as he walks to stand in front of the hero, one of the twins on either side. 

As he begins to chant louder I can see horrific , bulbous forms start to strain from within the twins stomach , they double over but are held aloft via forces I cannot see. 

The twins bones start to snap and deform, creating spines, hooks and horns. The men are crying at this point, and amazingly, still trying to apologize to the hero. 

Their fluids pool on the floor and start to run in rivulets to form twisting, looping symbols that beg me to join in the slaughter.  

As his chant reaches a crescendo the bishop rams his hands down the throats of the twins. Jaws buckling, throats tearing, eyes straining to stay in deformed skulls. He yanks his hands backward and in a spray of gore and grey swirling mist both men are violently turned inside out. Their bodies hit the ground with the wet thump of dead flesh. 

But not for long. 

Slowly the twins rise, reborn as horrors of raw muscle and bone shards, leather organs wrapped around them like armor, their eyes though, they retain a scared , panic stricken look. 

"Same as before choir boy. You couldn't do it, so I did. And now , not only did you lose 2 friends, I got 2 friends." The bishop says as the twins move behind him. 

The massive cherubic malignant lets the hero's head fall. I hear nothing, but I see tears falling as freely as the blood hit the floor. 

I realize at this point one of the twins is looking directly at the vent I'm hiding in. I have no idea if it saw me, or could communicate this fact if it did, but I scuttle as fast as possible back to the attic. I am in no rush to find out. 

And that leaves me here, a couple days later, and with a building anxiety at this happy group kicking in the attic door. 

A lot to digest, I know. But what do you think?

Should I accept my fate to be a killing machine? Or should I spit in the face of cold reason ? 

And do I check out this "Flea Market" , how much can I trust Kaz?
