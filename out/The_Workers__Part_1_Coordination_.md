The drive out to the suburbs seemed longer than thirty minutes, but we’d made it to the house before R’s timer went off. 



We all stepped out onto the street and R called out the time on her watch. 



*90 seconds.* 



As we waited, I walked to the front of the van and looked around at the street and houses nearby. I was surprised to see the state of the home, wondering how the woman inside had been able to accumulate so much *stuff*. 



Bulging white trash bags dripping with dark sludge, broken furniture, and garbage covered the brown lawn. 



I heard R call out again. 



*60 seconds.* 



As I turned to walk to the back of the van where the others were, I noticed a middle aged man standing in the front yard of the house to the right. He was hunched over, watering a sad display of dying flowers next to his porch. 



“It’s a good thing,” He called out at me, scratching his stomach through a greasy tank top that might’ve been white at some point, “That bitch has been ruining the neighborhood for years.” I smiled and politely nodded towards him, while he continued to stare at our van. 



*30 seconds.* 



“You can smell her fucking filth from the street,” He muttered, flashing me a smile made up of yellow and cracked teeth before bending over to spit onto the ground. 



Finally, R’s wrist watch timer went off, the shrill beeping yanking me away from the man as I walked back to the others. 



Glancing at my watch I noted the time: 2:03pm. 



It’s always impressive how accurate the time frames are. 



“Get over here and help me carry this shit,” C yelled and I rushed over to him. 



R was smoking the last bit of the cigarette she had lit on the ride over here, leaned up against the hoarder’s mailbox. C already had his hazmat suit pulled up over his work clothes and thick rubber coverings over his sneakers. R’s gas mask swung in her hand and she rolled her eyes at me. 



“Put your suit on, kid,” R said, tying up her blonde hair as she stepped into her own suit, “This place is gonna be a shit show.” 



“Of course,” I muttered, struggling to pull the thick plastic material of the hazmat suit up over my trousers and shirt. 



They’d both laughed at me when I arrived that morning, in my suit pants and tie. Not a great start to the day. But Kenny had told me to make a good first impression with the senior crew, so I was fine with a bit of hazing and light joking on the shift today. It was expected. 



Once I was dressed, C hoisted another duffle bag onto his shoulder and R stubbed her cigarette out on the asphalt. Before we made our way into the house, at the sight of R and C tugging the straps on their gas masks to tighten them, I did the same. My skin was already sweating underneath the plastic of the mask, the hard edges digging into my face. But still, it was a better alternative.  The stench just outside of the house was so strong it made my eyes water even behind the mask. Once we entered the house, it was even worse. It took every ounce of my willpower not to retch at the smell that encapsulated us as we entered the house. It almost felt like smoke or some sort of smog with how it seemed to cling to me. I struggled to follow behind R as she led us through the towers of boxes and trash bags. Even the floor was covered with dirt and trash. R opened a door and shoved her way through into the living room and I filed in after her. 



The corpse sat limp in the middle of the room. 



Her body was huge, taking up almost the entirety of the oversized armchair she was sitting on. She was naked and her skin was white and almost blue-tinted, veins huge and plump just underneath the surface of the clammy skin. And the smell was worse. It was like the sour bile you hack up after a night of heavy drinking and greasy food. I gagged and C laughed again, hitting me on the shoulder with an open palm before taking my duffle bag from me. 



“You never get used to it,” He said, unzipping the bag and pulling out a large blue tarp. I took one of the tarps from C and helped him set them up around the body. 



Though, to be honest, I wasn’t sure how much protection the floor really needed. 



As we moved away I stepped in something slimy that smushed underneath my boot and I cringed. Even worse, I unfortunately remembered the fact that I’d never read anything about a pet dog or cat on this woman’s file. 



“How long has she been dead?” I asked, shocked at the state of the corpse. This woman seemed like she had been rotting for weeks. Her skin was loose around the bulging flesh, like the furry skin of an overly ripe peach. A gentle press with one finger would be enough to tear it, letting you pull strips of the stuff off from the moist flesh. 



R stared at me blankly and I felt my face flush with embarrassment when I realized what I’d just asked. 



“She died at 2:03. Obviously.” 



C laughed at me again as he pulled another pair of gloves over his current pair. 



R unzipped her bag and pulled out a collapsible saw, one of the new ones the Department had just rolled out, and snapped the pieces together easily. She turned to look at me and something like annoyance or maybe apprehension flashed across her face for a moment before she smiled, pointing the other end of the saw at me. “You gonna help me do this?” 



I grinned before I could remind myself not to and stepped forward, gripping the other end of the saw excitedly. 



“*Aw*! No fucking fair R,” C whined, throwing his hands up in the air, “You’re gonna let him help cut?” 



“Shut up,” R walked over to the body and began positioning the saw over one of the woman’s enormous arms, “I’m the leader of this shift and I’ll decide who does what. Now grab a bucket. S was on my ass last week about wasting blood.” 



C grumbled to himself before he crouched next to the body. He held a bucket up underneath where the woman’s arm was and glared at me. I looked away, staring at the woman’s bloated face and dirty hair. Up this close I could see the mold and white maggots that littered her hair. The squirming bugs moved the hair, rippling across her scalp making her hair move like she was standing in a light breeze.



We sawed through the shoulder and armpit, cutting through a thick layer of yellow, shiny fat before reaching the pink muscle below. I watched R as we worked, tiny sweat beads forming on her tan skin as her ponytail swished behind her. She looked serene, as if there was nowhere else in the world she would rather be than here in this dump. 



My mask started to fog from the exertion and my hot breaths, but soon enough we’d sliced through to the bone. R pushed the saw towards me faster, yanking it back to herself just as quickly . Once we sawed through the bone the rest of the flesh was easy to cut. 



When she broke through the last remaining bits of skin I rushed forward to catch the arm, before lowering it down onto the tarp. When I stood back up R was looking at me again. But this time surprise blossomed behind her teeth and eyes as I wiped away a bit of blood from my cheek. I said nothing and let the strange exchange fizzle out as we worked on the rest of the body. Kenny had told me that morning that this was going to be an exciting job. Usually, we didn’t need to cut or saw the corpse into pieces. Not unless we couldn’t lift them. I made a mental note to buy him a drink next time we were out as thanks for getting me on this job. 



It took us another hour of cutting until we had severed the woman’s arms, legs, and head from her torso. C grabbed the other machine from her duffle bag and I watched as she set it up. I had only ever seen the CDF-56 in the classroom, so I was excited to be able to actually use one. 



“Here,” R said, handing me the long metal hose as she flipped the activation switch on, “Do the stomach.” I complied and shoved the tube down the womans’ mouth and throat, sliding it past her sternum and into her stomach where it sucked out the remnants of her last partially digested meal. When I pulled the hose out of her mouth I wiped it off and handed the contraption back to R who moved around to crouch at the other end of what remained of the body. 



C cleared the two amputated legs away from the body so R had room to work. I watched as she slathered a glob of lube onto the hose before sliding it through the folds of the womans’ exposed sex. R pushed the hose up into the corpse as she sucked out the remaining blood and phlegm from the vaginal canal and uterus. Once she was done, R removed the bloodied hose and lubed it up again before sliding it inside the anus. I cringed internally. The hose was a good three inches in diameter and would've been a painful stretch if the corpse was alive. R sucked the remaining fecal matter out of the woman before C turned off the machine. 



Now we were finished. 



I wrapped each of the limbs in tarps while C and R walked the buckets of blood back to the van. 



As I carried out the last arm, I struggled to make my way through the hoard and almost tripped before I finally made my way out. I walked to the truck and stopped when I heard C speaking excitedly to R. 



“- you mean it Frida? You *really want to*?” 



“Yes, just… just be quiet, okay? I really don’t want this to get out - it’ll only work if we keep this *private*.” 



R stopped talking suddenly and I forced myself to continue around the back of the van, acting like I hadn’t just been eavesdropping. But something in C’s lingering gaze made me think he had realized I’d heard. We placed the tarp wrapped body pieces into large medical waste bags. Some sort of dark liquid pooled in the bottom of the bags as I helped R hoist them into the crate, but thankfully none spilled out. 



I moved to step into the back of the van, not expecting either of them to give up the padded seats up front. But before I could, R reached out and gripped my elbow. 



“Come sit up front with me.” She said, her smile turning more genuine when C groaned in annoyance. He’d already been at the front of the truck and as I traded places with him, I couldn’t help but notice the way his eyes gleamed when I walked by. 



“...fucking stupid,” He muttered under his breath, “making me sit with that fat bitch’s body…” 



I chose to pretend I didn’t hear him, and quickly hoisted myself up into the passenger seat as R started the van. 



“Buckle up back there,” R ordered and C flipped her off through the rear view window. As we drove off, I couldn’t help but notice how *quiet* the van was. We were driving at least 60 mph down the deserted road yet I could barely hear the hum of the engine. I guess I shouldn’t really be surprised though, the Department have always produced high quality tech. 



It would take less than 30 minutes to get back into the city center with  fast R was driving. The crumbling, dull plaster houses and dead lawns slowly faded away into vast fields of black sand and rock as we left the suburb behind. 



It was nice to have a reminder of home so present in my current life. When I’d first accepted the reassignment to work in the City, I’d been worried I’d never see the dirt again. But even now I could almost smell that familiar sour stench: some mix of sulfur, wet earth, and rot. I smiled as I stared out the window, watching the black land rush past us. Part of me wanted to ask R to roll my window down, but I didn’t. 



“Have you ever been to a Drop-Off Center?” 



It took me a minute to realize R was talking to me, and I shot her an embarrassed half smile. 



“Uh, y-yeah, yeah. I’ve been to a Drop-Off Center before.”  I cringed as I stumbled through my sentence, continuing,  “I’ve only been to the one’s on the outskirts of the City though. Back home there was a Processing Center two towns over that I visited on school trips a few times when I was younger. But they wouldn’t let the kids see the Drop-Off area. Never been to the Center downtown before either. Well, I guess I *have* been downtown now but before I got reassigned I’d never been-” 



“*Jesus Christ*. Okay, I get it.” R snapped, cutting me off and I couldn’t even pretend to be offended, thankful she’d stopped my rambling. 



We sat in an awkward silence for a few moments before R spoke again. She must’ve taken pity on me, that or she was bored enough to entertain my conversation rather than finish the drive in silence. 



“Where did you say you were from again?” She asked, tapping some rhythmic beat onto the steering wheel with her fingers. 



“Novork.” 



R pressed her lips together and made an inquisitive noise so I continued, “It’s mostly a farming town - about a 3 hour train ride from the City. West of the Quad 2 I think.” 



“Damn, last I heard the City trains were up to 400 mph. Your town’s pretty far.” She grimaced, “You’re really from the middle of nowhere, huh?” 



I laughed. It wasn’t the first time someone had said that since I’d moved here. A good amount of people I’d talked to had never even heard of Novork. Not unless I mentioned its proximity to tower 43. 



But even then, tower 43 hadn’t been active in decades. 



“Is it on the outskirts?” 



“Pretty close,” I said, trying to relax in my seat, “It’s about 3 miles from tower 43.” 



I looked up and caught R gazing at me. She seemed to study my face for a moment before turning back to the road. 



“Does everyone there also have the…” She trailed off, gesturing to my face.



“What do you mean?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. I don’t know why I was trying to play coy, but most people weren’t so blunt as to outright mention my face and her question made me defensive. 



“The marks,” R deadpanned, “Don’t play dumb, I’m not trying to be mean. Genuinely. I just want to know, I’m curious.” It was a lost cause by now, and I sighed as I turned to look back out the window, catching my partial reflection looking back at me from the wasteland. 



Three thin black lines spread across my face, all converging from one point at the bottom of my earlobe, where a needle had been injected all those years ago. They faded the further they spread, disappearing into my skin after about four inches. My mother always used to tell me how lucky I was to have gotten *three* marks. 



There was one time, years ago by now, when I had stood in front of the bathroom mirror at my childhood home readjusting my tie before my graduation ceremony. My mother had been standing behind me, fixing the collar of my jacket and smoothing my hair. 



“You look so grown up.” She’d said, smiling as she stroked my shoulder, “And so handsome with these.” Her other hand reached up to press against my cheek, thumb sliding along the top line that stretched from my ear to just above my eyebrow. “You know, your father only had two lines,” Her voice was so soft, almost inaudible in my memory but those words stood out to me. I nodded and squeezed her hand reassuringly. Her smiling face reflected back at me from the mirror, soft wrinkled skin, brown eyes, and one thick black line from her temple to her chin - straight down her face. 



“It’s not as common anymore, not everyone does it,” I explained, pulling myself back to the present moment. I kept my eyes fixed on the landscape passing us by as I continued, “It’s mostly just traditional families who still follow the practice.” I glanced over at R and the grimace on her face spurred me on, “I mean, it’s really not that crazy. You don’t get injected without consent. And besides, my grandmother used to tell me how all the outer cities had a version of the tradition. Novork is just old school.” 



“Ugh, I guess,” R shuddered, “I just can’t imagine having that shit inside of me. Especially not in my face.” 



“It’s revered in Novork.” I snapped and R seemed to catch on to the finality in my tone. She didn’t bother to apologize but she seemed to acknowledge my request for silence and I was thankful for that. 



I sighed in relief when I could finally see buildings approaching. I knew I shouldn’t be too offended at R’s curiosity, but I didn’t want to talk about my face or give R the chance to probe deeper into my past. I wasn’t even sure if people in the City knew about our - and I certainly wasn’t about to enlighten anyone. 



“Did it hurt?” 



“Not really,” I shrugged, “Getting my primary immunizations every year hurts more.” R seemed to consider this and thankfully let the topic go, switching the radio on as we drove into the City. 



The concrete buildings were a welcome relief after spending all day in the suburbs, and at this point I was eager to finish the job and be done with the day. There’d been a sale on gin that morning in the employee canteen and I was praying there would at least be a bottle or two left for me to grab once we’d finished. 



Within a few minutes we pulled up to the Drop-Off Center, and the second the van stopped C swung the back doors open and jumped out onto the tarmac. 



“Thank god we’re here,” He yelled as R and I climbed out, “I mean for *real* \- I can’t fucking believe you made me sit back there with that *thing*.” 



“Don’t be crude,” R snapped, and my skin tingled with goosebumps as I watched their bickering. C shrugged and pulled his pack out, lighting a cigarette before passing it to R. She took it without a word. 



“Come on,” C muttered, gesturing to me, “help me pull the crate out of the van so we can be done with this shit.” I stepped up into the van and walked around to hold the back of the crate, filled with the bagged limbs and flesh we’d collected. 



“Don’t just push that shit out,” C called, as he started to slowly roll the crate down the ramp, “This thing is heavy.” 



“Alright.” I said, grunting from the strain of trying to slowly roll the crate down. I was doing my best to hold at least some of the weight as C eased it down the ramp. Eventually we got it down, and R handed the half smoked cig back to C. 



“Alright you’re off. We’ll finish up here,” She said, nodding at C as he grinned at her words. 



“Fuck yeah. See you at the bar in Quad 4 tonight?” 



“Maybe,” R said, waving C away dismissively, but I could see the hint of a true smile curling at her lips. 



I said nothing and we both grabbed a handle on the back of the crate and pushed it over to one of the conveyor belts. There were a few other groups hanging around the Drop-Off Center and two workers in green standing next to a large opening in the side of the center where the conveyor belt slipped out of sight and into the darkness. 



R and I made quick work of unloading the parts from the crate - tossing the plastic wrapped pieces onto the conveyor belt alongside the other workers. 



“Damn, never seen a part that big before,” The man across from me said as I struggled to push the last piece onto the belt, “Don’t throw your back out on your first day!” He and another worker laughed and I resigned myself to silence as I watched the pieces we’d collected slide into the Center, ready to be processed. 



“I’ll wrap up and get the crate back to the van,” R said as we walked away from the belt, “I gotta archive our work from today with the guys in the bay anyway.” I thanked her and she shrugged, tugging on the collar of her shirt to scratch at the skin below. Something shimmered in the setting sun. 



And then I saw it. 



A thin chain of sparkling silver lay around her throat. 



She didn’t seem to notice that I saw the necklace and waved me off, turning around to walk back to the van with the empty crate. 



My feet moved on autopilot as I walked across the street to the bus stop. I tried to convince myself it had just been a trick of the light but I couldn’t forget the sight of that shimmering silver chain. Looking down at my phone, my thumb hovered over the call icon for a moment. Rationally, I knew I should call the report line and tell them what I had seen. I didn’t owe R anything especially at the expense of my own safety. 



I pocketed my phone, rubbing my hands together for warmth  as I waited for the bus. The temperature had dropped since the sun had fully set, and I was thankful when I saw headlights pulling up the street. It was only a ten minute bus ride back to the office and I was confident I could get in, grab my bag from my locker, and get out with time to get to the canteen before it closed. 



The bus was empty except for an older woman sitting alone up front. I scrolled through my phone, opening up various apps and games before closing them and repeating the process. Once we reached the edge of Quad 2 I stood up and stepped over to the door. The bus hissed quietly as it came to a stop and I stepped out into the night, the street silent besides the sounds of my steps. There weren’t any restaurants or bars in this Quadrant so the streets were heavy with silence. 



Most of the clearance protocol to get into the building was automated, so I went through the routine of swiping my employee card, having my eyes scanned, and giving a blood sample via a finger prick before being granted access. 



Inside I was met with the muffled sound of hushed voices and shoes padding softly across the carpeted floor. Most of the offices on this floor had their doors closed, but some were cracked open. I walked past them quickly, head down and watching my feet take one step after the other. 



It sounded like there were a few people in the locker room but I couldn’t see anyone when I entered. I stepped out of my work boots and slid the oxfords I’d worn this morning back on. Boots back in the locker, jacket and bag pulled on, close the locker - 



I stopped dead, my breath caught in my throat. 



The voices were closer now, just on the other side of the lockers. I stood still, barely breathing, and listened.



“... did you talk to her today?” 



“... yes … I know that it depends on getting… *stop*, let me talk-” 



“You guys are being so … we don’t have time to argue about this!” 



“... Colin … talk to her or not? What did she … will she do it?” 



“Frida said yes … has to be next week…” 



My head was buzzing so loudly that I couldn’t hear anymore of what was said. 



*Frida*. 



I’d already heard that name today. 



One time I could excuse but now I felt a chill run down my back as my mind re-played the moment I’d heard C call R “Frida” earlier today. 



I took a short step back from my locker as my ears started to ring, head no longer buzzing but now pulsing with sharp pain. 



*We aren’t supposed to know each other’s names.* 



At this point, I didn’t care if the people on the other side of the lockers heard me, I slammed my locker shut and sprinted out towards the exit on the other side of the room. Once I was out of the locker room I turned and stumbled towards the staircase. I almost slipped on the last stair but finally I was outside the office, panting and gasping in the cold night time air. I don’t really know why I ran, but thankfully my headache had simmered down and the ringing stopped by the time I got outside. Something wet dripped from my nose down my face and I looked down to see a drop of red hit the dark pavement. I rubbed under my nose and when I pulled away my hand was smeared with blood. 



I glanced back at the office building and wiped the back of my hand on the inside of my dark coat, cleaning it the best I could. 



That made two violations in one day. 



First the necklace and now the name. At this point if I didn’t report this incident I would be putting myself in danger. The laws are different in the City, even a passive bystander could be tried if they were aware of the crime. 



But I still couldn’t bring myself to pull out my phone. 



Warm blood continued to ooze from my nose, cascading over my lips and chin before dripping to the ground. Not knowing what else to do, I started to make my way home on foot and prayed silently that the cold air would wipe my memory of today’s events. 



My nose didn’t stop bleeding till I got home. 

... --- ... 





... --- ... 

Three days later  I finally remembered what had happened in the locker room. 



The assignment I’d been on with R and C needed a lot of paperwork filed and I was stuck handling it all. Sitting in a cramped, stuffy cubicle, halfway through my fifth stack of forms, the memory suddenly hit me.



I jolted in my seat, back straight, shoulders tightening. My hands clenched uncomfortably as my breath caught in my throat. 



*Frida*. 



With hindsight, it’s surprising to me that I wasn’t more concerned with the actual contents of C’s conversation with R and the strangers in the locker room, but at this point the chill that ran across my skin was from the realization that I knew her name. 



I gripped the faux leather arm rests of my chair and dug my fingernails into the soft material as I tried to force my mind to move past *that* name. 



But the more I tried not to think about it, the more it burned into my mind. 



I still had another two stacks of forms to get through but I couldn’t sit in the stale office air any longer. The buzzing fluorescent lights over my head felt like they were burning the white parts of my eyes. Before I could talk myself out of it, I jumped to my feet and grabbed my briefcase, storming out of my cubicle. 



*Breathe. Regulate yourself.* 



Most of the cubicles around me were thankfully already empty, no one around to hear the staccato *huff - huff - huff* of my nervous breathing. My fingers clutched the handle of my briefcase tightly as I made my way through the maze of cubicles towards the elevators. Once I stepped out into the common area, I forced myself to slow down. There were still enough other workers here that I needed to get myself under control. I was already playing a dangerous game letting that name bounce around my head. It wouldn’t do me any good to set off more suspicion by sprinting frantically through the lounge. 



Stepping in front of one of the elevators, I noticed my hand was shaking slightly as I reached out to press the DOWN button. I snatched my arm back and stuffed it into my pants pocket. My other hand still gripped my briefcase handle hard enough I could feel my fingers starting to go cold from the lack of blood flow. 



I watched the screen displaying the levels the elevator was descending as it made its way to me, and bit down on the inside of my cheek to keep myself from tapping my foot as the numbers slowly descended. 



*70 . 69. 68. 67. 66.*  



Suddenly my phone rang. I jumped as it buzzed in my pocket, playing a quiet chiming sound as I fumbled to grab it. 



“Hello?” As soon as I answered I realized I hadn’t even looked at the caller-ID but thankfully the voice on the other end was immediately familiar. 



“Renat! I’ve been trying to call you all day! Guess you forgot about our plans for tonight but I’m not letting you get out of it man. You *owe* me for getting you a place on that job in the suburbs. That was not fucking easy-” 



“Kenny.” I interrupted, massaging the bridge of my nose as I tried to come up with some excuse to get out of our plans for drinks tonight, “I’m sorry I forgot, but I’ve been in the filing office for *ten hours today*. I just want to get home.” 



The elevator dinged and was empty as I stepped on. 



“*Renny*,” He drawled mockingly, “I’m already at our spot and I have a whiskey on the rocks slowly melting on the bar for you.” 



I sighed and knew I was beat - and from the way Kenny laughed as I ended the call told me he knew the same. It wasn’t like I had an early morning tomorrow, and I really did owe him. 



The elevator came to a stop in the lobby and I started to make my way out of the building. There were a few people milling around and the usual number of security guards posted up in pairs at each of the doors. One of the guards caught my gaze as I headed towards the doorway. His eyes were dark, sunk deep into his face and outlined in shadows. I kept eye contact for a second too long and he narrowed his eyes at me. He scanned my face, looking for…something. But before he could find it, I hurriedly pushed my way through the exit door, leaving him and the assault rifle strapped to his chest behind. 

... --- ... 





... --- ... 



“Well, it’s about damn time! I was starting to get bored- *Jesus* Ren, you look like shit.” 



I couldn’t help but laugh at Kenny’s observation as I slid into the seat next to him. 



“Thanks, Ken, I’ve always prided myself on my looks,” I snorted, grimacing as he slid over what must have been - at some point - a whiskey on the rocks. There was a puddle of condensation around the bottom of the cup that slid with it, and the watered down amber liquid inside threatened to slosh over the rim of the cup. At the look on my face, Kenny rolled his eyes and waved the bartender over, ordering another drink for himself and for me. 



“It wouldn’t have melted if you’d been here on time,” Kenny laughed, but I could see the mild annoyance behind his eyes. 



“Look, Kenny,” I started, running my finger around the rim of the cup, “I’m sorry, I really am. I didn’t mean for time to slip away from me.” Kenny turned to look at me, raising an eyebrow expectantly. “Here,” I pulled my wallet out from my jacket and placed a $50 bill on the counter of the bar, pushing it over to him, “this rounds on me.” He grinned and snatched the bill off the table. 



“*Aw*, Renat, you really know how to treat a guy!” He turned, batting his eyelashes at me, “You’re forgiven.” 



“Thank God,” I muttered, reaching for my new drink to hide my smile behind the glass. We talked for a while, though it was mostly Kenny monologuing at me about his office’s watercooler drama while I nodded along. After making our way through another round of drinks, Kenny finally asked me his burning question. 



“*So…* how was the job? Best one you’ve been on yet, right?” 



My grip on my glass tightened, and I tried to keep my tone casual. 



“Yeah. It was great. Thanks again for getting me on the team for that.” 



I looked over at Kenny, hoping my half-hearted response would satiate his curiosity. Just from the look on his face I could tell Kenny wasn’t impressed. 



*Fuck*. 



“Just great?!” He exclaimed, signalling to the bartender for another round before turning back to me, “I get your ass on a level 5 job and all you can say is ‘it was great’? Come *on* man, I want details! Give me the juicy shit! I heard she had the biggest parts that have come through in the last year, that is way more than just-” 



Kenny’s voice trailed off in my mind even though he was still talking, waving his hands emphatically as he spoke, but I couldn’t hear anything besides the high pitched ringing that echoed inside my head. I watched his lips move, forming abstract shapes my mind couldn’t process as words. A thin dribble of spit fell out of his mouth, slowly sliding down his chin before it dripped onto his shirt. 



 All I could think about was the way that silver chain had laid around R’s throat. 



“-he*llo*? Earth to Renat?” I flinched when Kenny’s sweaty hand landed on my shoulder, jolting me out of my thoughts. I looked up at him, tensing at the look of genuine concern on his face. 



“Renny? … *what’s wrong? ... you okay*?” My head was pounding, one part of me still trapped inside my head while the other desperately tried to pull me back into the present moment. 



“I have to go.” I shrugged Kenny’s hand off of my shoulder and grabbed my bag, hands shaking as I pulled a $50 bill out of my wallet and slapped it on the bar. “Here, to pay for the drinks.” 



“Renat, wait! You already gave me cash-” The rest of his words were drowned out by the conversation and music surrounding me as I stumbled towards the exit.
