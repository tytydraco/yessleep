Have you ever wondered how the characters of a book feel about their author? What they think when you pick the path they walk? When they suffer the ends you choose? What if they could make you think twice? These thoughts flow through your head as you type out one of the most brutal scenes in your new book. The damsel in distress is being tortured for information. Information too dear to release. So as a result of her refusal to speak, she is put through some heinous activities that would make any reader spill their guts. But your okay with it, because this is the way you intended this to be. 

As you type, you start hearing tapping on your window. Praying it's not some hooligan pranking you, you walk over to the window. As you peer through it, you see nobody outside. You open the window to feel the breeze on your face. It's a windy night, and there is a beautiful tree that is showing signs of the Autumn season taking effect. It must have been a branch blowing in the wind, tapping against the glass. 

With your conscience clear, you close the window and go back to typing out the scene. But as you start typing, you notice something. A set of text that you don't remember typing reads "Please stop". Did you type this? You don't remember typing it, but you must have and momentarily forgot it while looking out your window. You delete the text and continue the story, the hero has infiltrated the facility where the damsel is being held, but is facing heavy resistance. The torture methods become increasingly unbearable for the damsel, the hero doesn't have much longer to save her. When the hero finally makes progress, you recieve a call from a friend in Discord. You answer it looking to take a brief break from the typing. You converse for about an hour about games, anime, your story, and the strange little incident. Your friend says that's wierd, and to not stay up too late, and hangs up to let you finish. 

You switch back over to the document to continue the chapter, but you see another set of text, "It hurts". Second time tonight, what the fuck is happening right now? You must be getting tired, but you were hit with inspiration, and don't want to let it go just yet. You hit backspace, get rid of the text and continue. The hero plows through the enemy forces and reaches the torture room, where the damsel is in terrible shape, fatal wounds everywhere, and it looks like her torturers were in the middle of "finishing" on her open wounds. After the hero slaughters the sick fucks, he holds the damsel in his arms. What comes next is an emotional scene where the two confess a love for eachother, but you have one outcome in mind. As you type out her dying words, you hear a knock outside your room. 

You almost want to ignore it, but something takes hold of you and guides you to the door. You don't wanna open it, but you still put your hands on the doorknob, and twist it. What you were expecting to be the scariest thing you'll ever see in your life turns out to just be an empty doorway. No one is there. Feeling sleep deprived, you shut the door and go back to finally finish the chapter. And to your dismay, another set of text has been typed, "Don't do this". You're filled with terror, anger, and absolute madness, as you start smashing the backspace, but instead if the text going away, it continues. "I have been through enough". Your hand continues, "You sick fuck". You try stopping your hand, but you notice that you can't move your other hand. It's constrained to the arm of your chair with a belt. The text continues, "Look what you've done to me". Your hand is just holding down the backspace like it's a weight, producing an ASCII assortment that looks like the bloody, mangled corpse of the woman in your mind. But then it stops at the words "I can see you..." as you hear the thumping of feet quickly approaching behind you, immediately stopping at your back. 

You know you shouldn't turn around. You know what's behind you. She beckons you to turn around, like many times before for you to take your medicine. So you turn from the corner you hide in. Both your arms are now constrained in a straight jacket, as your eyes meet the room you have been in since you released your book and showed your true nature. As she administers the drug, you feel your mind slip back into your nightmare, as the padded walls turn to drywall, and furniture starts coming into view. You're back at your desk, and your typing a chapter with a torture scene in it. 

Some characters deserved better, but you wrote them that way, and now they have written you.
