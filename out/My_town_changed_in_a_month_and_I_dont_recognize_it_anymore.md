I swear I’m not crazy. But I’ve been watching my town change, and it feels like I’ve been thrown a hundred years into the future.

When I was a boy, the streets were dirt, and children played stickball till dusk. You could hear the crack of bats and the laughter of neighbors from one end of Main Street to the other. Farmers sold eggs and apples at the roadside. Horses clopped past, wagons rattled, and the tallest building in town was the library, three proud stories with stained-glass windows on the top floor.

Everyone walked. It was the simplest thing in the world. To the bakery, to church, to the grocer. You could greet half the town just by strolling two blocks.

But then, all at once, things began to change.

The first week, the dirt roads were scraped smooth and covered in black stone. The footpath under the maples, the one we all took to the market, was plowed under. “Progress,” the mayor called it. The market itself was rebuilt farther away. Nobody minded, except me, when I realized the walk was twice as long.

By the second week, the road had doubled, then doubled again. Yesterday two wagons could pass side by side; today six roaring lanes of machines shot past. Crossing felt like standing before a firing squad. A boy named Samuel didn’t make it across. The drivers only blasted their horns, as if he had no right to be there.

The buildings changed next.  
The library had once had colored glass windows on the third floor. I remember climbing the stairs with my father. But one morning it was only a squat brick box, flat and windowless. Margaret’s house lost its second story overnight. People just shrugged.

And then some buildings didn’t just shrink; they vanished. The post office. The drugstore. The old theater. One evening they were there. By morning, the lots were flat, striped in paint. Nobody even mentioned the loss.

Main Street didn’t mourn either.  
The family businesses went under, one by one: the tailor, the bakery, the toy shop. I thought there would be grief, but instead people smiled. They said, “It’s fine, there’s a bigger store twenty minutes away.” They said it like it was good news, like it made things easier. Even the shopkeepers, faces pale in their empty storefronts, forced stiff little smiles and nodded as if it were all for the best.

It was the smiles that unsettled me most.

The corner store went differently.  
I woke one night to see a crowd standing outside it. They didn’t shout. They didn’t argue. They just pressed their hands to the brick. The walls creaked like something alive under strain. By sunrise the store was gone. The ground was smooth and black. Mr. Alvarez was gone too. When I asked about him, people turned their faces away.

Even the houses began to twist.  
Where there had once been little walkways leading from front doors to the street, the paths bent sideways overnight. Now they lead only to the driveways. Step out your door and you’re steered straight to a car. The houses themselves seem to drift back a little farther each night. Ten feet. Twenty. In some cases you can barely see them from the street anymore. Voices don’t carry that far.

And the lawns keep stretching.  
I remember when Mr. Dawson pushed his mower while whistling, and Mrs. Henson swung her scythe like her father before her. The yards were small, the work quick. Now they look like fields. Nobody mows on foot anymore. They ride little machines across endless grass that wasn’t so big yesterday. From a distance, the riders look like toys circling endlessly.

The children are gone too; not gone, but hidden.  
They used to play stickball in the street, chalk lines drawn across the pavement, shouts echoing through the block. Now, whenever an engine sounds, mothers rush out and yank them inside. Doors slam, curtains snap shut. The way the street empties reminds me of an old Western, right before a gunfight. Except this happens every day.

The strangest moment was when I was walking home one evening.  
I saw the Dawsons on their porch. When they noticed me coming down the street, they froze. Mrs. Dawson clutched her husband’s arm. His face was tight with fear until I came close enough for him to recognize me.

“Oh,” he said, almost laughing. “It’s only you. We thought it was somebody else.”

They didn’t say who. But the way they hurried inside after, shutting the door tight, I knew. Around here, anyone walking is treated like a danger.

I tried walking toward the edge of town last week, to see if the farms were still there.  
Mr. Whitaker used to sell apples and eggs from a stand by the road. My kids loved his fruit. But when I reached the spot, there were only neat houses and driveways. No barn. No stand. Not even a fence post. A man watering his lawn frowned when he saw me lingering.

“You’re lost,” he said flatly. Then he turned, and his garage door closed behind him.

And my friends are changing too.  
James once walked everywhere with his daughter, pointing out the old shops. He was the kindest soul I knew. But the first time I saw him behind the wheel, he nearly struck me in the crosswalk. He didn’t wave. He didn’t apologize. He leaned on the horn and sped so close I felt the heat of his engine. That wasn’t James anymore.

By the fourth week, I was the only one left walking. The streets roared with iron and smoke. The trees were gone. The porches were empty.

Even the old dirt path to downtown has been erased. Where it once began, a new sign stands: NO TRESPASSING. THIS MEANS YOU. I could see downtown just across the grass, close enough to touch. But I couldn’t reach it.

And now it’s at my door.  
This morning the sidewalk was gone. My steps lead straight into twelve lanes of traffic.

If I want to eat, I’ll have to try to cross.

I don’t know if I’ll make it back alive.

The strangest thing is that everyone else seems happy.

If you ever hear construction outside your window, if you ever wake to find the street wider than it was yesterday, don’t stay. Run.
