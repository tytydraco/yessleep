From all vantage points my situation seemed bleaker than a junkie's promise.

Never mind. I dared take a look-see in my bathroom mirror.

Surveying last night's damage, I said only, "Fuck." But, in my own defense, it had a fair bit of starch in it.

Normally, I'd ask you to excuse my français, but not today I won't. And for at least a few reasons.

Reasons I won't beg nobody's pardon at the moment:

1. I'm from Brooklyn and if you can't handle a few F-bombs peppered across this cursed wasteland I call my situation, well, now might be a pretty good time to take advantage of the copious Exits.

Still here? You brave. Or psycho. Back to the list:

**2.** I'm a licensed PI, and, since early last week have been in mortal jeopardy thanks to my BF.

"BF," aka, "Butt Face," and coincidentally, the source of the Satanic Scourge I seem to be staring down.

Yep, Satan is here and now this very today. Satan has come garbed in the cloak of a uniquely difficult case, and client, also known as two curses for the price of one, that may, or, may not, prove the death of me; or, worse.

To wit, my messed-up mug. This time yesterday, well, I wasn't exactly a specimen, but my reflection wasn't turning people to stone either.

I spit another tooth into my hand. Pantomiming a 1970s vintage Dr. J hook-shot, as I did with all non-recyclable refuse, I faked left, pivoted right and hooked. The bicuspid arced towards the wastepaper basket on the kitchenette floor. A hush fell over the arena.

The shot looked good for a second, and then, then it missed, bouncing off the metallic rim.

I tracked the tooth for two quick hops before it disappeared out-of-bounds, under the baseboard heating panel of the small one-bedroom apartment I've lived in for 25 years.

Wiping away some blood from my lower lip I took a look around.

"I've been here too long," I said to the big empty room. My voice had a slight lisp to it.

I heard the wind whipping from my corner-facing bedroom. It seemed to say, "vooooooooooooooooooooooodooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.........." before Dopplering away into an anticlimactic infinity.

I rented a studio in a very old building in a very old part of Brooklyn. The building's capstone had been laid to rest but a decade before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria plunged Europe into demonic trench warfare lasting approximately as long as a frat-boy's folly. I only mention it because both my great-grandfathers perished in those trenches.

**3.** Somebody left a parcel on my doorstep.

**i.** Contents of said parcel?

**a.** 1 headless chicken and;

**b.** a small bottle of cane syrup

**c.** a corncob pipe full of what looked like spectacular weed buds and;

**d.** some pocket change; 2 quarters, 1 nickel and a penny to be exact

**e.** 1 folded up bloody note on line ruled paper.

The note read, in what I guessed was chicken blood, as follows:

*Limen balenn nan – o an n rele lwa yo.*

*Sonnen ason an – rele Papa Legba.* 

*Nan kafou a, o nou angaje.* 

*Papa Legba – louvri baryè pou lwa yo.* 

*...*

I looked at the wall. My Felix The Cat shifty eyes wall clock informed me it wasn't even 10 AM.

And here I was full of no-caffeine, hands stained with fowl blood and not an inordinate amount of cortisol.

A minute later, back in the bathroom mirror, I wasn't having any more luck than I did with the mystery box.

Black eye. Contusions decorating my cheekbones. My nose was broken. Again.

A broken nose didn't bother me. Wasn't my first party with a pushed-in proboscis, so I knew it wasn't too serious. Just looked awful.

That, and to be perfectly frank, I wouldn't be winning any beauty contests anytime soon; even under the best of circumstances; cosmetic or otherwise.

What really bothered me was the job I had agreed to last week wasn't working out well for me and to add insult to injury the damn chicken blood wasn't coming out in the rinse.

This whole situation was starting to creep me the fuck out. Seriously.

It was now additionally proving injurious to my peace, emotional stability, and confidence to ever eat popcorn again.

I spit some residual blood and another tooth in the sink. Easy come. Easy go.

I carefully cleaned up the rest of my face using a wet and warm soapy washcloth, some peroxide, and then finally, some anti-bacterial ointment I dabbed on carefully with a cotton swab.

While the last of the bloody water was circling the drain my phone played the beginning of That'll Be The Day by Buddy Holly.

I gazed into my phone's face. Looked better than mine, well,  except for the shitty text message. Butt Face! Hereafter referred to as, "BF" for the sake of brevity.

"Drop your cocks and grab your socks," the text read. Subject ETA: 20 minutes."

...

Okay. Here's the deal.

Up until last summer, I had been working as a consultant since before Covid, doing security for a large org headquartered in midtown Manhattan, which proved, in the end, to be threatening my perma-smile.

And I, being a mouthy sort of fellow, did what mouthy fellows often do when middle-level manager types try to tell us the piss they are attempting to inflict upon our heads are little more than happy summer raindrops.

What I'm trying to say is I'm between jobs somewhat often.

We, in the business, call it being on the beach.

And, sadly, that metaphorical beach is where my tale takes a wrong turn at Albuquerque.

That's where, Butt Face (real name \[redacted\]), BF, I mean, comes into the frame.

BF is my college roommate and best frenemy. I call him Butt Face, because from 2010-2015 I did the time warp again. When I returned from outer space sans Major Tom, BF was the first person I visited.

"Why are you staring at my face," BF asked in a not-too-friendly manner as he packed a bong hit for old-time's sake.

I remember looking closer at his visage. Something was way different. Way off, one might say.

"There's something different about your face. I'm trying to figure it out."

"Oh! That?"

An odd sort of smile I had never seen him crack in any of the over thirty years I had known him appeared. I can't say it didn't make the sweat running down my spine turn to icy teardrops. He looked like he won something. Something he didn't realize might not really be a prize.

And that's when I kinda realized in my gut I had lost my bestie. Lost him right to the evil deity of stupidity.

It was his face. That's what was all shitty.

Round. His face was round. Circular. Like a fucking cheese wheel.

It used to be triangular, more like a cheese wedge. In fact, in college BF had been a fairly good-looking guy who received attention from some of the ladies of the eighties. You know, wingman stuff that's too embarrassing a detour so just scratch that on second thought.

What happened to his face? Only this

BF had a few not un-large swaths of adipose tissue, also professionally referred to as, "butt-blubber," surgically transplanted in his face; cheeks, forehead, under the eyes, and chin. I felt like that emoji that's trying not to upchuck lunchtime's chicken chimichanga.

BF looked nervous. Nervous like someone slipped the Goodnight Moon bad acid in their cheese smoothie. I looked at his hands as he jabber-jawed me. They seemed to be trembling.

The other thing that changed in five years was BF's economic situation.

BF had finally failed up after decades as, well, as a bum.

Yes. It was astounding. In my absence, he had failed Up, up and away, into his next start-up venture.

This was the kid who borrowed from everyone in the dorms during our college years. Borrowed from everybody and paid back exactly zero dollars and cents. His pool of lenders was forever facing severe drought and yet that never discouraged his pathos.

And now, he had magically metamorphosized into some kind of butt-faced tech bro. And now he was offering me a chance for work. No, not just work. Embarrassingly high-paying work.

I felt the weed hit me just right. In my head I heard Robert Palmer sing:

Said the fight to make ends meet

Keeps a man up on his feet

Holding down his job

Trying to show he can't be bought

\-Every kind of people

...

I turned BF's offer down.

"You sure dude? That's a lot of fucking knish we're talking about here."

"Yeah, I'm sure," I said feeling none-too-sure.

We had already been in business once during the 90s doing a start-up distributing comic books. I still have thousands of copies of Youngblood #0, Turok #0, and Plasm #0 with the Chromium Foil costing me way more than zero just for storage. Yet, I just can't let some things go. Sort of like letting go of your youth and your oldest best friend.

The bankruptcy I endured after our first venture also seemed to outlast the sparkle that had once made me want to be BF's pal back in college. Boy, things sure do change as time goes by.

Yes, they do. Not only was the man's face rounded up to the highest whole number but the twinkle in his eye that was once bright, if not mischievous, well, now it seemed necrotic with a grayish and hungry evil. Predatory.

It was like, there my oldest pal sat. Right across from me. No social distancing here. But he wasn't him. But if he was not him, who was he now? And where had he gone before? All that investigating and weed smoking was making my head hurt.

So, there we were, in his apartment facing the park, doing bong hits and reconnecting but really not.

It looked like my friend. I mean it did then again, not quite. But like I said, I had been out of circulation for a nickel bid and didn't really recognize the lay of the land upon my return.

What threw me upon my reemergence ten years ago was people walking around the city texting. It was like the zombie apocalypse had begun and I somehow had missed the memo.

Hell, I never even bothered with social media in the first place and never texted anyone before 2015. What's wrong with an old-fashioned call, anyway?

Of course, as a PI, that is where almost all the action is now. The DMs, I mean. Satan, too.

*The devil's in the DMs.*

Anyway, I'm only telling you this because after I quit my consulting job and wasn't succeeding in picking up any new clients my attitude started to adjust. As I watched my bank account get ready to crawl under a duck's ass I thought about tech bro's butt-faced offer and whether it was bogus.

Yep. There was a text from BF offering me mega-gainful employment.

And, like the Taurus I am, I turned him down again.

"But why, bro? You busted."

"It doesn't really sound like something I'd be interested in."

"Suit yourself, dude."

...

Fifteen minutes later BF was in my crib. I was drinking Starbucks from a paper cup he brought.

"Dude," I said. "Bum rushing me ain't gonna make me take the job. I appreciate the joe and your enthusiasm, really dude, but it just doesn't sound like a good time."

His fat face creased into a look of disappointing disapproval.

BF turned, starting to leave my crib, his hand about to unlock the front door when I said, "Yo, brother! Fuck your job but I'll take your money and tag along just for kicks and giggles."

...

The Job

BF was having an issue with one of his hires.

The hire in question was the new CIO for his startup, "Genetic Illusions, LLC".

The cold rain pecked at my neck like maybe my chicken did in his headful days.

I turned up the collar of my raincoat and adjusted my fedora.

"There she is," BF said, hunching against the elements.

I snapped a photo. Then a few more.

She was dressed in a man's business raincoat. She was hatless and carried no umbrella. She had thick red hair. She walked hurriedly north, down Union Street, her narrow shoulders hunched against the slanting rain that was threatening to morph into sleet. I felt the temperature dropping down as the wind tried to bite through my coat as I crossed the Gowanus Canal.

"Okay, Archie. Now I just need you to do what we discussed," BF droned for the 99th time.

"I wired 10% into your account last night. The rest when the job's done. Should be a breeze for you, Cassanova."

A sleet pellet hit my eye. I rubbed it with the back of my hand.

"Okay. You can beat it, now."

He looked like he was going to say something then changed his mind. I thought about changing mine too but then I thought about my bank balance threatening to self-harm. So, I said nothing, too.

BF said, "Well, then I'll let you get to it," and he did.

Alone in an alcove I spied the lady move. She was about 5' 4' and was wearing black leather boots with 3" heels that made her about my height. I didn't say I was tall. I only think tall thoughts.

I followed her to a corner bar in Boerum Hill called, "The Iron Horse Factory".

I'd like to say she played hard to get. But it was easy. Easy as a Sunday Morning in The Slope.

...

Two Weeks Later

I ducked the vase. It made a loud shattering sound and rained shards down on the floor. And my vacuum had just gone on the fritz too.

I looked at Susan in horror.

She looked back at me the way a wolf looks at your picnic basket.

"BUT I LOVE YOU ARCHIE!!!!"

It seemed that BF had not given me the whole story. About his startup. Truth was his mother arranged it so he'd be taken care of after she kicked. She knew he was a lifelong couch potato, so she prevailed upon her wealthy lover, Irma, to set BF up in her Silicon Valley son's hottest new BioTech startup.

What they hadn't counted on was BF suddenly decided to go from the silent role everyone expected him to embrace to some foreign, new persona to pair with his new fat moon face. He was now tech bro b-boy. Not a wrinkle to be found on his 55-year-old cheese face.

Yes, that's correct. After decades of willful sloth, BF had not only had cosmetic surgery and hired a team of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to help him make up for lost time on the couch playing XBOX.

With a vengeance BF dug into the DSM assisted 24/7 by the best and brightest in the field. He had a vision. He had decided, like any tech bro or sis might, that he, alone, could cure the mental health of our nation. He simply needed to do one simple trick that wives hate. He, in his own manic words, "needed to date the DSM" to evaluate their latest genetic biologics.

Now I was studying compsci back in college and I didn't know the DSM from DMT. But it turns out that's the *book of crazy.* This BF character had gotten it in his head that he was going to surround himself with what he called, "Cluster B-Girls," until he found the genetic remedy to once and for all end the battle of the sexes due to personality disorders. He gushed this all out while he furiously washed his hands in my sink for what was going on minutes.

BF was going to prove everybody, including is 84 year old mother wrong. He wasn't a slacker parasitical Gen-X'er pretending Stan Lee was Shakespeare. He was Butt Face Tech Bro Boy ready to make them chromosomes dance to the music.

**BF Makes His (Genetic) Mark**

A genetic biologic that would pacify and regulate the borderline. A chromosomal therapy that would bring hot empathy to the narcissist. That would make anti-depressants a thing of the past. A therapy that went to the heart, genetically and with the assistance of nanobots, to make HAPPY the NORM.

"How's it working out," I had asked him.

"New CIO is jamming us up. Holding us back. I can't get out of the contract either. I need you to get something on her, bruh."

So, I did. She had a history of mental health issues. I think it was because her career military and religious father had left her mother for a hirsute plumber named, Javier when Susan was in the fourth grade. That was the time she confided in me on her memory foam pillows that she had begun her lifelong fascination with pulling the wings off of flies.

DAYS LATER

Endless sex. Alcohol. Weed. Telling of life stories. Her dad blowing a judge. Her mom moved in with some guy with pink aviators and sharp creases in his Sergio Valenti designer jeans. No time for a little girl. A little bad-tempered redhead who was a biter. Who pulled the tails of cats? Who had an IQ off the charts? Who went on to get a Ph. D. in genetic engineering before she was thirty.

Who charmed my dumb college friend BF? Who got an ironclad contract with a poison pill? Who was threatening to blow the whistle? But, on what?

I blocked what seemed to be the fiftieth punch that rained down upon me.

"I hate you love you hate you love you hate you love you-"

It did seem to be a thin line, indeed.

And then something odd happened and that is why I wrote this.

I saw a demon in her eyes. From the inside. Peering out. Windows to the soul? All I know is it had hideous boils that festered with bitterness, envy, and uncontrollable anger.

"I'll KILL you then myself!!!" she screamed.

She punched down at my face.

I saw a golden mist congeal into a halo over her head.

The demons behind her blue eyes looked to the left. They looked to the right. But not in a wonderful cat way like Felix. More like in a screw your head around 360 degrees Exorcist way.

Then they cursed me to hell. She cocked her head. To the left. Then to the right like someone who had pool water in their ear.

"HATE-LOVE-HATE-LOVE-HATE-LOVE-HATE-LOVE-HATE-LOVE-HATE-LOVE-HATE-LOVE-"

This time I let her hit me. And then I let her hit me again. I didn't even feel the blows until I vaguely registered that we might be passing The 400 Blows mark.

Well, that's where even I draw the line.

Only, I didn't have to. She began to sob. Her arms hanging by her sides at an awkward angle as she straddled me.

"Don't go away and leave me!!!!! I'm sorrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy."

I think she was all punched out.

And she confessed to a felony she had never told anyone about before.

...

Later that night, I told BF what he could do with his job.

His reaction was not quite what I had expected.

He laughed. And then he laughed more. At me.

"She's product, bruh! A fucking bot! A clone! A troll! A genetic copy that's hijacked, well, that's a trade secret. Now seriously, I need you to stop fucking around. And don't forget, we can freeze your accounts, sue you for non-performance and a lot of other heinous shit the golden rule gives us the power to do."

His face was pure evil. I didn't know this person. Or this planet. Clones. Chickens. Hoodoo? Please.

...

Back to Reality

...

I looked back at my phone. "Drop your cocks and grab your socks," the text read. Subject ETA: 20 minutes. PS- That Starbucks you drank the other day has an LSD genetic hybrid variant so if shit feels weird, well, just know it's not wearing off anytime soon, bruh. And maybe we can do something about your crow's feet next week, Arch."

***20 Min Later***

And there she was. Her hands were manicured. As if she didn't ground and pound me for 12 rounds last night. A happy to see me expression on her pale freckled face.

"Wanna take a bath?" I asked.

Private Investigator Tip #23: Cleanliness is next to Holiness

Her face got electric bright. Like a phone that hurts your eyes in the middle of the night.

"Sure, sure, sure-"

"Can you run a bath, and I'll be right along?"

"Sure, sure, sure-"

About ten minutes later, with the CIO in the tub, I was ready.

My vintage 1940s toaster on a very long vintage 1950s extension cord I had picked up as a pair at the local thrift shop.

I opened the bathroom door. She had pulled the Superman cape shower curtain closed. Anticipation is everything.

"Anybody home?" I asked.

"Maybe," she giggled.

"I can come back later on the horse I rode in on."

"NOOOOO!"

The Superman cape flew in the wind. And there she was naked as the day she was spawned.

She smiled like the Scylla and Charybdis, her eyes taking a walk all over me until she noticed the toaster with no bread in it. Before she could mouth the words, "What the F-" I let gravity, electro-magnetism and Calgon take her away.

Her eyes turned red. Her whole being began to shake. My jaw almost hit the I have to wash my gross bathroom floor.

Sparks came out of Susan's orifices followed by steam and the stench of Ground Zero.

"My evil!!!!! Evil!!! Eeeee-villlllllllllllllllllll"

And then her whole fucking face exploded from the inside making her head expand like a lung before retracting. As her exploded face retracted wires and goop protruded from her ears, nostrils, and mouth. And then she just froze in an L position and stayed there saying a whole lot of absolutely nothing.

That's when I heard Buddy Holly again. And, of course, BF had texted again.

BF Text: ***Status update?***

Me: Wire the fucking money degenerate. And then lose my digits.

I felt something break deep inside. It was time to get off the grid.
