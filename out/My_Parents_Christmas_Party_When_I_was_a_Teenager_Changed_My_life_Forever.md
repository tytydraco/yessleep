  

I woke up with the mild tingling still on my cheeks. 

Ugh – it had started from last night at my parents’ Christmas party, when that old hag Aunt Bliss kissed me firmly on the cheeks, planting her clumsily-lipsticked lips with a loud smack. “Look at you, you handsome devil!” she had shrieked, already three sheets to the wind on free party booze- “I can remember you running round in diapers- or without, as was often the case HAHAHA!!”

I tried to push her off me, glowering at my mom for forcing me to attend this stupid party with their stupid relatives. Like why. Why did I have to be there? I had always been creeped out by Aunt Bliss – something about her eyes and mouth- and she never ever gave me any decent presents, but I didn’t ever remember her being so touchy and kissy. 

I wiped off her spit from my cheeks, and even though I tried to do it surreptitiously, she noticed and took offense. “Are you wiping off my kisses?!!” she yelped.  “Don’t you dare do that, you little demon! here, I’ll just give you some more!” and she lunged at my face again, SMACK! SMACK! I can still remember the feel of her fleshy gross lips pressing on both my cheeks. 

“Those are some kisses you can’t wipe off!” she shrieked drunkenly.  I stumbled away from her as politely as I could, and escaped to my room shortly afterwards, feeling nauseous from the feel of her lips and also all the food and alcohol and body smells and sounds in my parents’ living room. I thought I could feel my mother’s anxious eyes follow me out, but when I looked back, she was tossing back another drink, cackling with Aunt Bliss and her brother my Uncle, another old disgusting geezer- ugh. 

Paying no attention to me. Fine, I thought to myself, I’ll go up and maybe choke on my own barf, that will teach her to ignore her own son for the sake of a stupid party with her goddamn horrible relatives. 

Aunt Bliss’s kisses burnt on my cheek. I scrubbed and scrubbed with my most expensive exfoliator, and my whole face was angry flaming-red, old acne scars appearing to glow. I tried to muffle the sounds of the party floating up, and the burning in my face dying down to a mild tingle, I eventually fell asleep. 

But my face still felt tingly when I got up. I knew I was going to break out- Aunt Bliss’s disgusting mouth was probably infected- I grabbed my phone and zoomed in on my face on the camera.

Yup, three small red spots had already formed on each cheek, exactly where her lips had touched. I burned with hatred for Aunt Bliss- and for my mom for making me attend that party and meet her relatives. She knew how sensitive my skin was- my long struggle with acne. Tears of frustrated pain and rage pricked my eyes. A breakout just in the holiday party season. Great. I zoomed in closer. 

The red spots on my face were moving. 

I leapt up from bed and rushed to the bathroom. It was quite early, and my parents were fast asleep in their drunken stupor- only dead silence coming from their bedroom. 

I stared at my face in the brightly-lit bathroom mirror. 

The red spots visibly swelled before my eyes, changing colour to neon-lime-green. All the rage I had been feeling melted into a bottomless fear. 

They didn’t grow larger than regular pimples, but then they burst open. 

Out of each pimple, a tiny green worm the length and shape of a needle protruded outwards, lifting itself upward from my face, but still firmly attached to my flesh. 

Three on each side. 

My face, my whole body was numb, as I stared hopelessly and helplessly at the parasites, intertwining and curling into each other, waving their terrible thin tiny bodies. 

I looked closer in the mirror, my nose almost touching the chilly glass, and the worms too, slithered on the glass, leaving a trail of greenish slime. They had no eyes, but they opened their tiny mouths, their heads splitting in two, and I could almost see their sharp sharp tiny teeth, and I knew they were terribly hungry, and I needed to feed them soon, before they continued feeding on me. 

I jumped at the sound of knocking on the bathroom door. “Darling, are you ever going to come out?” my mom called shakily. 

“Just a minute!” I called back. 

I grabbed some pimple patches that I kept stored in the bathroom, ripped them open and stuck them over the worms, kind of forcing them down back into my face. These were the expensive translucent kind, and I knew with an application of foundation, they would appear almost invisible.  

I went out. My mom was so hungover she could barely focus. She pushed wordlessly past me and slammed the door closed. I knew she would a while. 

I could feel the worms slithering around frantically under the pimple patches- they didn’t like been stuck down inside. My fear slowly gave way as I started planning.

I quietly stepped into my parents’ bedroom. The smell of stale booze and vomit filled the morning-dark air. My dad was faintly snoring, sprawled on their bed in a very uncomfortable looking position. 

The worms were squirming on my face, and I wondered how long the pimple patches could hold them in. 

His bare feet stuck out from under the blankets. I looked back down the corridor, the bathroom door was still firmly closed. I pried off the pimple patches, and brought my face close to his feet. 

The six worms slithered out from my skin, and attached themselves to his toes. I could feel them pulling at my skin as they sucked and sucked greedily. My father muttered in his drunken stupor, but didn’t move. 

They were tiny things after all, it didn’t take long to satisfy them. They were done in less than a minute, I think, letting go of my father’s feet and curling back on my face. I thought about affixing the pimple patches on them again, but then thought, why should I?

I heard the bathroom door open, and fled into the safety of my own bedroom, locking the door behind me. 

I lay back on my bed, held up my phone to my face, and examined the worms, now curled up in three tiny perfect green circles on each cheek, half in and half out of my body. 

My little wormy pets. I touch them gently. I think I’ll be very happy with them. Aunt Bliss has finally given me a nice Christmas present.
