My name is Cillian Davison. You might have heard of Cedric Millard’s death, but only I and a select few know what truly happened. You see, in the year 2005 Cedric Millard joined my band.


It was called Deadbeat, fans and critics would describe our sound as post-grunge, but truth be told we didn’t give a flying fuck. The lead-up to Cedric joining as our drummer was messy, to put it lightly.


It all started in March of 2005, when our old drummer Jared Pryor left the band without much notice. One day he simply didn’t show up to the studio, and in my inbox lay an email stating he had to leave for personal reasons. I’d never been close with Jared, and to be honest he had always been the band’s weak link—deep down I think he knew it too. So I never bothered to ask any follow-up questions. Nothing against the guy, but he wasn’t worth my time. Instead my bandmates and I, desperate for a replacement, resorted to the internet, scouring semi-local music forums to post our ads on. In the end, RockersofSeattle.com was where we found our success.


In early May, I—being the one who posted the ad—got a private message on the website. It came from a user called manicmillard298, and read: “Hi Cillian! My name is Cedric Millard, I saw your post, and I’d be glad to try out. Do you have a date in mind?” The message stood out, it felt almost overly formal, but what weirded me out the most was his usage of my first name. Yes, it was in my profile name, but still, it felt… wrong. Under that message was another one, it housed a MySpace link along with some text, “Here’s a video of my playing.”


Below it another message appeared, it held nothing but two symbols—a colon and a parenthesis—together forming an eerie smiley face.  A shiver ran down my spine as I clicked on the link, and it pulled me into Cedric’s world. His crappy webcam showed a grainy video of a mess of a room. It was only inhabited by Cedric, and his worn down drumkit, and somehow I could almost feel the smell of sweat and beer through the computer screen.


What the video showed me made the decision undeniable. Three days later Cedric arrived at our studio, and it didn’t take long until everyone agreed that his skills far outweighed his quirks.


Cedric’s talent rivaled that of even my favorite drummers, with merely five years of experience he already played on a level close to Danny Carey and Mike Portnoy. We didn’t have to think about it twice—Deadbeat had its new drummer.


Something I always admired about Cedric was his constant striving to improve. He was never satisfied—after finishing a crazy drum solo, or writing the drum part for our next hit, he didn’t relax, proud of his work, instead he immediately asked what he could do to improve. His behavior didn’t worry us, at first, but instead we gladly welcomed it.


Cedric’s appearance was weirdly refined, he wore the usual “grunge-attire,” worn out band tees, ripped jeans and Converse sneakers, but there was an out-of-place precision to it. Everything looked orchestrated—down to the last, minute detail. Each tear on his jeans looked tediously planned out, and his band tees looked washed out to perfection. His aesthetic seemed almost… fake. Like he’d just recently adopted the style, and tried his absolute hardest to replicate the photos he had seen. Like he was trying to fit in, be someone he actually wasn’t.


I returned to his MySpace page, trying to find an old picture of him, but there was nothing. Even the video of him drumming, which had been there a couple of days earlier, was deleted. His about me section, previously empty, now hosted five lonely words, “Drummer for the band Deadbeat.”


In my mind a scenario played out: Cedric, after getting the tryout, happily trotted to his nearby clothing store. Well there, he carefully picked out several items, based on the reference photos he had found online. He paid for his new clothes, smiled politely at the cashier, before walking home and tinkering with them until they perfectly resembled his references.


For the second time Cedric sent a shiver down my spine. Something about him—maybe it was his perfectly messy hair, or maybe it was his black, smudged eyeliner and its contrast to his pale face—just freaked me out. It all felt like a facade, an elaborate attempt to make us believe he was one of us, even when it felt so obvious, at least to me, that he wasn’t.


The rest of the band quickly accepted him, Lynn and Scott were never as cynical as me. I think they were just too relieved to have found a replacement, a fill-in for Jared, that they looked past all of the red flags, even when they were waving in their faces. In a sense I didn’t blame them, still don’t, especially when the replacement was someone as good as Cedric fucking Millard.


I can assure you my band was good enough without Cedric. Scott on bass, Lynn on guitar, and I on vocals had always been the core of the band—we didn’t need Cedric. Yes, we had our first big break shortly after he joined, yes, many people chalked it up to his skill, but they were wrong. I have never met anyone who works harder than me, and I won’t just stand by and watch the credit to my life’s legacy get taken by some fill-in. By some nobody.


Of course these were all things I said behind his back, after all my bandmates would practically lynch me if I drove Cedric out of Deadbeat. At night Lynn would sit, worriedly listening to my rants about him; she’d tell me I was being ridiculous, maybe I was, before giving me a kiss and heading to bed. Worst of all was the looks I had seen Cedric give Lynn. I know she noticed it too, those light-blue eyes, the disgusting craving in them, but no, “Cedric is too important for the band!” no, “He didn’t mean anything!” I loved Lynn, but she was too naive. It was cute sometimes, but in times like this I hated that aspect of her. I didn’t feel threatened by him, oh no, I doubt that man had scored even one date in his entire life, but I truly did feel disgusted. Those depraved eyes… like a starving hyena that hadn’t seen food for days.


Scott shared Lynn’s sentiment. Part of it might’ve been his open-mindedness, and his disdain towards conflict, but it really did seem like he too saw no problems. I would often see him trying to make small talk with Cedric, but it was clear that he struggled to break past his cold gaze. We all did, Cedric was a very reserved person. It didn’t bother me, fuck if I cared about him besides our music, but it visibly bothered Scott. He was one of the most social people I knew, and to see him time and time again try to engage with Cedric, only to be shut down, was hard to watch. I knew it hurt Scott, somewhere deep down, even if he couldn’t admit it. You might think I’m some super-empath after hearing that, but you’d be mistaken. Scott was a very emotional guy, and it didn’t take a damn therapist to see how he was doing—but being my friend I of course asked him about it. He’d just shrug it off, “It’s fine, really,” and that was that, I didn’t keep poking.


Please excuse my rambling, just been a while since I last thought of it all. It still nags at me, you know?


Even after all of the “drama,” which my bandmates said was just baloney, Cedric had managed to weave his way into the band. I certainly couldn’t say I liked it, but at the end of the day it was what was best for the band. What was best for my band—and that mattered more than anything.


During the following months I—sorry, we—would go on to write our biggest song ever. Chances are you’ve heard it: Only Fools was, and still is an undeniable classic. I could say things like it changed the game, and that it inspired many generations of musicians, but that would be lying. ‘Cause the only thing my biggest song is remembered for is Cedric Millard’s fucking drum part. If only the media knew a thing or two about music they’d realize that yes, the drum part is brilliant, but so are my raw, groundbreaking vocals, but so is Lynn Phillips’ legendary guitar solo, and so is Scott Canavan’s near-perfect bassline. I could rant about it for hours, and I certainly have, just ask Lynn, but this isn’t the time for that.


The song was part of our second studio album, Godforsaken. The entire album was a huge hit, and it seemed like Cedric’s drumming was the final push we needed to bring our already great line-up into stardom. It pains me to admit it, but I’ve got to give it to the guy, his drumming was freaking awesome.


To my surprise, the writing and recording process went smoothly, even with Cedric in the equation. He still had his oddities—and I still loathed them—but as time passed they seemed to somewhat mellow out. The googly eyes he’d give Lynn were still there, but they had less intensity, and happened far less often.


Instead rock-solid beats filled our studio. Don’t get me wrong, the guy was practically my nemesis, but I had almost started to understand what Lynn and Scott saw. His drumming didn’t just suffice, but it full-on rocked. I couldn’t understand it, Cedric Millard’s drumming cannot be done justice with mere words. The most complex beats looked like second nature to him, and polyrhythms he made look like Weezer. I could not understand it. That was until one day I got a glimpse into Cedric’s own home.


After wrapping up in the studio Scott suggested that we do something, hang out for once in a while. I think we finished recording the song Running Out that day. Lynn was immediately up for it, which made the answer obvious to me, so Cedric was the only one left to answer.


“Sure, I’ve got nothing better to do,” Cedric murmured.


“How about we go to your place Cedric? If you don’t mind, of course. None of us have actually ever seen it,” I quickly added, unable to hide my almost morbid curiosity.


Lynn turned her gaze towards me, and in her eyes I saw something. Hesitation, irritation, but hidden beneath that… fear? I glanced at Lynn, confused, before Cedric interrupted our staring contest. “Works for me. Don’t get your hopes up though, it’s really nothing special.”


That was a huge fucking lie; well—it depends on what Cedric meant by special. His two-bedroom apartment was squeaky clean, and certainly not the same rugged mess as I’d seen in the old MySpace video. On the outside it looked pulled straight out of an IKEA-catalog, but to the keen eye, my keen eye, there were several clear anomalies.


Cedric lived in a wholly unremarkable neighborhood. I would specify its name, but to be honest there was nothing about it to remember. What I do remember is what was inside of his apartment.


Cedric fumbled with his keys for a bit before opening the door to his apartment, and I couldn’t help but notice his keychain. First of all there was his pentagram keyring, it caught my eye, but at the end of the day the man did play in a grunge-band. Second of all he had a surprisingly high amount of keys, as he struggled to unlock his door they rattled, like a cobra hissing at its prey. I couldn’t wrap my head around what he could possibly need that many keys for—I tried to shake it off, but maybe it was an early hint of what was to come.


Well inside Cedric led us to his living room. He instructed us to sit down on the gray, plasticky sofa, before excusing himself, “I’ll be right back, just need to fix something.”


The first thing I noticed in the room was the fancy flat-screen TV; it looked mighty expensive, and I couldn’t help but wonder how the hell Cedric had afforded it. Along with a DVD player, it rested on a brown, wooden TV stand. It held two shelves beneath it, and they were crammed full with DVD’s. The text was blurry, both faded and covered in fingerprints, but I could just barely make out the names of some of the times biggest grunge-bands—Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and even TOOL, which weren’t even grunge. Intrigued, I walked up to the collection to further inspect it. “Something catch your eye?” Scott jokingly said.


“Not really, just wanted to get a closer look,” I answered, feeling almost exposed—like I’d done something not allowed. Embarrassed, I ripped out a couple of DVD’s, trying to briefly finish what I started. The titles were all of the same nature—an interview with Danny Carey, a Soundgarden concert, Live at the Garden with Pearl Jam, the list went on and on. Confused, I put the cases back, reaching for another handful. More of the same. Not just live recordings, but interviews, documentaries and even behind-the-scenes footage. I quickly scanned the shelves, and all of it was the same.


“What the hell,” I muttered under my breath, this wasn’t just fandom, this was full-on obsession. I quickly tried to compose myself, though a single cough gave my facade away.


“You alright?” Scott asked, genuine worry in his voice.


“I’m fine,” I answered, trying to hide my unease, but it was pointless.


“You sure? You look a bit pale,” Lynn lightheartedly added, although I could sense a tad of true worry in her voice.


I shrugged it off, kissing Lynn before telling her she shouldn’t worry about me.


Lynn looked me in the eyes, and for a second I could see her worry poking through her facade—but then it was gone. Lynn always knew when I was lying.


From Cedric’s living room I could see the kitchen, the hallway and what was presumably his bedroom. I knew that the bathroom was through the kitchen since Cedric told us, but that wasn’t where he had vanished to. There was actually one more room in Cedric’s apartment.


Before I tell you about it, I first need to mention his bedroom. While Scott and Lynn were making awkward small talk, I quietly excused myself.


As I walked towards his bedroom my eyes drifted down the hallway. At its end a door stood, lonely and imposing—menacing in every sense of the word. A big padlock lay on the floor before it, and the door was tightly shut. The door didn’t just intrigue me, it demanded my attention, but first I needed to investigate Cedric’s bedroom—an opportunity like this was not one to pass up.


Cedric’s bedroom seemed plain enough. Its white walls and laminate floor were awfully mundane, and the beige XL bed in the corner wasn’t any more interesting. “Nothing of note here,” I thought, but then my eyes fixed on the drum mat occupying the room’s other corner. On it stood a cardboard box and a drum pad, and behind them on the wall, a drumstick holder rested. It was absolutely crammed full of drumsticks, most of them rough and chipped. On the mat there were several pairs of drumsticks too, all of them completely broken—someone had clearly been practicing a lot.


What was even weirder were the contents of the cardboard box—the parts of a drumkit, covered in a layer of dust, and completely disassembled. Cedric had clearly been practicing here, so why was the kit packed away neatly in a box? The answer presented itself underneath the carton; a small sticky note, barely making itself visible. I gently picked it up, careful to not leave any traces. “Invest in soundproofing, dick,” the note read, written in a shaky but seemingly firm handwriting. My heart raced as I carefully slipped the note back underneath the cardboard box, making sure to leave half of it visible, just like I had found it.


I discreetly left the bedroom, my stomach in knots. What I had found in there wasn’t small by any stretch of the imagination, but the door tugged at me. The promise of something more, something even wilder hiding behind that door.


As I made my way towards the last room the image of the padlock slowly got clearer. That thing wasn’t just big—it was fucking huge. It was the type of lock you’d see on the outside of a storage container. The thought I’d had since the first time I saw Cedric reappeared, only this time with even more footing. “What the hell is this dude hiding?”


As I inched closer to the door an immense presence grew. I wasn’t sure if it belonged to the door, or something on its other side, but whatever it was wrenched my guts. A drop of cold sweat ran down my forehead, into my eye, as I noticed the door gap—the latch of the lock was visibly engaged. Almost scared, I wondered what he could possibly need two locks for, but the same thought as earlier interrupted me. “What the hell is he hiding?”


The pressure had grown almost unbearable as I stood mere inches from the door—I was sure Cedric was in the room, but the presence I felt couldn’t possibly be his. Nothing human could emit such a dreadful aura. As my heart raced fast a different question popped into my head, “What the fuck is he doing in there?”


Unable to stop myself I placed my hand on the doorknob, feeling almost as if the overwhelming presence was calling me, absorbing me. It was ice cold. A shiver ran down my spine and I felt almost glued stuck to the doorknob. I wanted to rip my hand off it and run—run to safety—but my body wasn’t responding. I felt my arm start to pull on the doorknob, defying every survival instinct in my body, but then the door opened from the inside.


“What are you doing, Cillian?” Cedric asked, his face as dead as a statue. I froze in place, the presence was as strong as ever—I could almost feel it leaking from the godforsaken room. A smell also leaked from the room, metallic, rotten, dead. Mentally I stumbled backwards, while physically I remained stuck in place. There were no actual tangible threats, but the feeling was undeniable. It was like nothing I’d ever felt—it felt like I was going to die.


“You okay, Cillian? You look awfully pale… and sweaty,” Cedric said, interrupting my panic. The words were all correct, what you’d say to someone who seems unwell, but the tone felt so, so awfully wrong. He spoke with the same cadence as always—like his mind was in another place, uninterested, bored.


I snapped back to reality, hastily muttering, “Yeah, sorry, just wanted to see where you went, but kinda zoned out.” It felt as if we were in court; Cedric was the prosecutor while I was the defendant. I wiped the cold sweat off my eyebrow, desperately trying to compose myself.


“Alright, let’s not keep the others waiting now,” Cedric said, toneless as always. What he didn’t know, and I didn’t know either until the worst day of my life, months later, was that I had caught a glimpse of what was inside the room.


I don’t believe in God, or any religion for that matter, but what I saw in that room must’ve been some kind of hell.


Not long after, Cedric got evicted. One day, a couple of weeks before our America tour, he arrived at the studio with all his stuff packed into his car. Both the trunk and backseat of his car were filled with boxes—the same kind as I had seen at his apartment a month earlier—and they were neatly packed to the brim with his stuff. One box was filled with dishes, two were filled with disassembled furniture, and even the box with his drumkit was there.


But there was another box too, at first I thought it was just filled with books, and yes—there were a shitload of books—but not only. Not only did the books have weird names—The Book of Shadows, The Grand Grimoire and The Book of Oberon are some of the titles I remember—but there was more in the box. Candles, incense, and even the large padlock which had once hung on the damned door. An immense wave of deja vu came over me as my eyes once again locked onto that hellish lock, and a shiver ran down my spine. A pearl of sweat formed on my forehead as the memories washed over me; the enormous presence, that foreboding feeling, and the certainty my life was going to end—right there.


I instinctively took two steps back from the car, my head felt light—like my knees had given out and the ground was eating me whole—and the edges of my vision blurred. As I plummeted towards the ground Cedric carefully caught me, breaking my fall. His grip was tight as a vice, and his fingers dug into my side. His hands were so very cold, it felt like a corpse was holding me. “Are you alright?” Lynn worriedly asked, shattering my trance. I stumbled out of Cedric’s firm grasp, mumbling a weak “Thank you.”


Lynn helped me inside the studio, gently guiding me onto the teal couch. All I wanted was to rest, to act like nothing had happened, but the blunt question shattered any fragment of denial I still held. “What happened?” My eyes fixed on Lynn, I wanted to tell her everything; the apartment, the locked room, and that unbearable presence, but I couldn’t find the words.


“What has been up with you lately?” Lynn asked, her tone shaped by frustration. I could tell that this was the straw that broke the camel’s back—the culmination of irritation and anger that had been building up for weeks. “Ever since we visited Cedric’s apartment you haven’t been yourself!” she bluntly exclaimed, and truth be told she was right.


Ever since that night—since that encounter with that cursed door—I hadn’t been my normal self. Starting the first night home after the visit I had a nightmare. A nightmare that would repeat every night for weeks, against my will replaying what I would later know was what I’d seen in that doomed room. My lack of sleep leaked into the day. To the frustration of my bandmates I was unable to focus—and to Lynn’s growing anger I couldn’t give her the attention I knew she deserved.


“What is with you and Cedric? Why can’t you coexist?” Lynn yelled, there was soundproofing in the studio, so no one would hear. Something changed in Lynn’s eyes, slight, but noticeable, before she asked, “Are you jealous of Cedric? Is that it?”


Lynn stormed out of the studio, leaving me alone with my thoughts and with my pain. “FUCK!” I screamed. A visceral, primal scream—I couldn’t keep my anger inside anymore. Tears formed in my eyes, they raced down my face and inevitably landed on my white sweatshirt, coloring small patches gray. A thought grew in my head, I tried to drown it, kill it, but when the first fragment of it had formed it was already too late. “It’s all Cedric’s fault.”


According to what my bandmates later told me Lynn went directly to her car—tears streaming down her small, round, face. She ignored every confused yell and shout Scott made, and well inside she drove away. That was the last time they saw her. I doubt she even looked back, not that I would have.


“Until you get better, we are over,” the message read. I didn’t respond. The text felt like a bullet, sinking my heart deep into an inescapable, dark abyss. Neither did I cry—I just sat, staring into the soundproofing’s ever-repeating pattern, listening to the clock tick by. Time felt as if it was standing still, and my mind was completely empty except for one thought, “Everything was fine until he entered my life.”
