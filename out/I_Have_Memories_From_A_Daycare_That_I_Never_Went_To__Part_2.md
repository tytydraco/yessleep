I called my mom to ask if she remembers anything about me spending time at Mrs. Rand’s house during the summer of our year in Wisconsin. 

“Mrs. Rand… Mrs. Rand… no I really don’t recall any lady with that name. Did she live by us?”

“Yeah,” I said. “She lived like… right by us. In a white house.”

“White house… I really can’t remember. It was such a long time ago and we didn’t live there for long.”

“Well do you remember if I ever went to a daycare at all that summer? Like, even just a couple of times?” I asked. 

“No, no. Nothing like that I don’t think. We didn’t go on any trips that year where we didn’t bring you. I mean, you would play with a couple of friends outside a lot but I’m pretty sure that’s it.”

That confused me even further. I don’t really remember having too many friends in Racine apart from the few I would see at Mrs. Rand’s. 

“Okay. Thanks mom.” I said, hanging up the call. 

I don’t really have any more answers than before, but I have more memories. They’re really all I have to work with at this time. There’s no one that shares these experiences with me. At least, no one I can talk to about it now with. I’m an only child, neither of my parents seem to have any idea what I’m talking about, and I never saw any of the children outside of the daycare. Except for Cory somehow. I had met him before my first day at the daycare somewhere, but the memory isn’t scratching its way free for some reason. 

The next notable thing in this rough timeline I remember must have been a couple of weeks after my first day there since I knew the kids a bit better. There was Lucas: short, pale, and blonde; Jasper: tall, dark with black curls; and another girl I had met: Sarah. She was tall and tanned with chestnut brown hair. She was a bit older, too. Older than all the other kids really. She must have been eleven or twelve. I remember thinking that was weird at the time since that’s when I thought you could kind of be trusted to be home alone a bit more. It's the age I was when my parents started leaving me at home a bit more, anyway. 

The weather was getting nicer outside as the spring rains became less frequent which means we could all start playing some games in the fenced in backyard which was great since there was a wooden jungle gym complete with a swing set. Up until that point we had to make do with either board games or Cory’s odd idea of action figures. There had been an old Mac computer in the upstairs common area, but it was always on this weird page that showed some sort of CCTV footage of an empty concrete room with no door and a flickering, fluorescent light. When I asked Jasper if we could play any games on it he said no.

“It only shows this screen,” he told me. “You can’t exit out of it or open a new tab or nothing. I tried to turn the screen off one day but the button didn’t work. Things just busted.”

“Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?” I asked. 

“Can’t find the power cord. It’s like it goes back into the wall or something.” he said. 

It freaked me out a bit at the time but as soon as we weren’t cooped up inside everyday I mostly forgot about it. 

We were in the backyard one day playing a game called ‘*Lava Monster*’. I’m sure it has a bunch of different names for different people but it’s where everyone gathers in different places on the jungle gym or various places that are off the ground. Whoever is the so-called ‘lava monster’ has to try and tag someone else restarting the game with them as the lava monster. The catch is that the monster can’t open their eyes when they’re off the ground, making their attempts to tag someone a grabby, dangerous mess. If a player is on the ground and the monster sees or hears them they can yell: “the ground is lava!” and that will count as a tag. 

Lucas, Sarah and I were all on the jungle gym staying away from Jasper. He was the lava monster for the round after Lucas tagged him in the previous one. Us three were growing a bit relaxed as we watched Jasper target another kid who was playing. I think his name was Ethan. Since Ethan was the odd man out being secluded on top of the swing set, Jasper had deemed him the easiest prey and was working out the best way to reach him. Casual conversation had started between us three as we watched the scene. 

“How come you chose to play with us this time, Sarah?” Lucas asked. “You always sat alone watching us before.”

“I don’t like playing when Cory is.” she said sheepishly.

“Why not?” Lucas pressed. Sarah paused before answering. Like she was trying to order her words right.

“If he gets you by saying the ground is lava, it really burns you.” she said as casually as one points out a cloud. 

“No way.” Lucas said immediately. Tall tales were as common among us as they are among most children and it was as fun to vehemently defend them as it was to spread them. Despite this, Sarah simply nodded her head at Lucas and looked back to the scene of Ethan and Jasper. Most of the time when a child isn’t believed it becomes their new life mission to prove it true, but Sarah just nodded Lucas her answer and moved on. Like it wasn’t something she wanted to talk about. 

I couldn’t really call her a liar. Whenever Cory was playing the game with us he never really relied on getting people on the ground. He would always go after them on the jungle gym. He was the best at the game and his rounds would never last long. He always seemed to know where everyone was, even with his eyes shut. 

I glanced over to Cory. He was on the deck, talking with Mrs. Rand. The conversation looked odd. It wasn’t the way a kid and an adult talk to each other. It was like two adults having a weird, calm argument or something. Cory was wearing a grimace talking at Mrs. Rand and she was staring forward, nodding occasionally. Her face was painted in her signature sadness. It was as if she didn’t want to meet his eyes. 

“Hey, why are you so dirty?” Lucas said, pulling me back into the game and the jungle gym. He was looking at Sarah. I remember being a little upset with him in that moment because even at that age I knew that was a rude question to ask. I had to admit though, she was *filthy*. Her hair was greasy and slightly matted and dirt clung to her skin and under her nails. Her clothes were a bit faded and worn and they even looked a little too small for her.

“The showers don’t work here.” she said to him.

“Why don’t you shower at home?” Lucas asked, a tone of judgement in his voice. 

“I haven’t been home in a long time. The door isn’t there anymore.”

“What door?” I asked.

“The front door.” she said. “It isn’t there for me anymore.”

Lucas and I looked at each other not knowing what to say. I think we silently agreed that Sarah was just weird and left it at that. More time passed as Jasper failed to reach Ethan. I remember he was just attempting to climb up after him, his eyes clamped shut, when something above the tree line caught my eye.

“What’s that?” I said. It looked like a tower of some sort but it wasn’t right. All of the towers and skyscrapers I had seen by that point were made of steel beams and reflective windows, but this one looked like it was made of houses stacked on top of each other. The different colors of siding making up each layer. A beige set of shingles rested on the roof that topped the structure. It was uncanny to look upon. An overly tall house in the distance, the bottom of it obscured by trees. It had to be five or six stories high. 

Lucas craned his neck to see where I was looking. Sarah knew immediately.

“That’s where the wax people are.” she said, keeping her apathetic tone. 

“What?” I said, confused. “Wax people? Like… like the ones in museums?” Me and my parents had been to one such place in Keystone, South Dakota a couple of years back when we were visiting the Black Hills, but the tall house didn’t look like any museum I had ever seen. 

“Kinda.” Sarah said. “But I think these ones are real people that put wax on their skin, cause they move and stuff. Sometimes they come over here and we all have to go in the crawl space. I don’t think it's happened since you two have been here.”

Again, Lucas and I just stared at her and then at each other. I was forming my next question on my lips when Ethan suddenly jumped down from the swing set to get away from Jasper’s flailing hand. He bolted to the fence and hopped up on it before Jasper could yell ‘the floor is lava!’. 

Jasper was after him quickly, running to the fence to try and tag him. Ethan swung his body to the other side and clung to it, avoiding the ground as much as Jasper. When he did I heard Mrs. Rand scream as she shot up from her chair on the deck and ran down the stairs.

“You have to stay inside the fence!” she sobbed as she sprinted to Ethan and Jasper. Seeing her in this state immediately pulled the two out of the game and Ethan scrambled back inside the fence saying “Sorry! Sorry!”

When he hopped down Mrs. Rand grabbed his arm as well as Jaspers and backed them all away from the fence. Tears were streaming down her face by this point. When they were backed away twenty feet she released them and collapsed to the ground, shuddering. Ethan and Jasper took some steps away from her and froze, not knowing how to react. 

“So, how are you liking it here?” Cory said, right next to me. I jumped a bit but he didn’t seem to notice. I never even heard him climb up here with us. I must have been too focused on the commotion with Mrs. Rand and the other kids.

“Uh… it’s good.” I said. Cory’s face turned up in a smile, scrunching the scar tissue up in that way that always made me wince. He began to laugh in the shrill tone he always used.

“It is! It is good! You’re right!” he laughed, moving away and using the slide of the jungle gym. 

Oh, god… I think I remember how I met Cory. I just remembered it now, as I’m writing this. Remembering his high pitched cackling knocked something loose, I think. 

This must’ve been before I ever went to Mrs. Rand’s since he already knew me on my first day. My mom took me to a park near our house. I remember I wanted to go to the one at the school but it was being worked on or something, so we had to go to the only other close one. It was adjacent to a bike path that ran through the woods and was far more humble than the one at the school. Just a couple slides and a set of swings if I recall correctly. When we arrived, there were a couple other kids with their parents, but the only one that isn’t a faceless blur in my mind is Cory. 

He looked just as he did at Mrs. Rand’s: white t-shirt, blue jean shorts, pale skin, pale blue eyes, a shiny bald head, and that pink scar that ran down his cheek. He wasn’t playing on any of the playground equipment like the other kids. He was just standing off to the side with his hand extended out. I must’ve walked up to him at some point because I remember asking him to play some sort of game with me, but he just stood there staring at me, holding his hand out. After not too long I reached my own out and clasped hands with him. He smiled and shook my hand excitedly. When we let go of each other he began prancing around and laughing that awful laugh.

“Now you’re in the weird!” he said to me as he hopped around. “You’re in the weird! You’re in the weird! You’re in the weird!” 

I remember I laughed as he did it but when he kept going I stopped. I tried to talk to him, to ask him what that meant, but when he just kept going and going I left him and went on the slides. He pranced and shouted like that up until I was getting ready to leave with my mom.

“What a happy little boy!” she laughed, looking at Cory. “I wonder where his mother is?” 

If Cory’s mom was there, I didn’t see her, and I watched him prance and yell the whole time we walked away, his small, bobbing figure getting smaller as we got further. I can’t believe I forgot about that. God, it’s all coming back to me now that I’m writing it out. I kind of wish it wasn’t.
