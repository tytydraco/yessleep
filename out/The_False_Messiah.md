I might as well adress all of your concerns before I tell my life story to you. No I do not have "red horns", or a tail in the shape of a pitchfork. I did not shapeshift into a serpent, nor am I a "fallen angel". The Devil you humans

read about and throughout all your folklore isn't me. Yes all that stuff happened; A serpent did persuade the first woman, named Eve, to eat the Forbidden Fruit. But I did not do it. No, what if I told you, that the God you so pray to,

is a false one at that? And he has forsaken my name for eons. No my name is not Lucifer, nor is it Hades. Hell, even in you human's folklore, I do not exist! I, in your stories, your mytholgy, am best represented by "Zeus". 

Yes, the greek mytholgy told, while not false, was hugely misinterpreted. Alot of religions, tend to be a unique take on the gods afterall. Now as you can see, I am not a buff man with long hair, wearing a toga. But the lighting

abilities are a shared thing between me and him. I am the King Of Gods afterall. For simple namesake, you can call me Orasil. As my true name would shatter your mind. 

I am not a typical god, no you see, I created many gods, and many of them, you humans created these characters in folklore based on them, over the milennia they visited your world. My son, for instance, who you call Loki,

is pretty accurate to the mythos. A trickster. A caniving prince of darkness. But he wasn't always that way. This is where things start to come together. Long ago, before time even was a concept, when the heavens were the

only place to call home, there I was. Along with many of my sons and daughters. One of my sons, who you call Thor, had an idea. What if he could create a world? A world with organisms, a world full of life. I chuckled at

this thought, and confronted him. I asked him "What could you possibly do with this creation? This little project of yours?". He got upset, and told me down best he could, "Father, with due respect, it's more than just a project,

this could change everything. Everything we know about the universe, even you don't have all the answers." I look at him, and he's not wrong. I was the first, but I didn't create this existence. I am as oblivious as every other being

in this vast cosmos is. I allowed him to do his little hobby. Thor would spend, in your measurement of time, nearly 4 months of nonstop work on what we came to learn "Earth." Safe to say, I was impressed. Loki, being the older

brother, teased him at first. Loki wondered what Thor could possibly even begin with this little project he created, and how this could make the superior god. I told Loki that's enough, and to leave him be. I patted Thor on the

shoulder, and told him I was proud of him. He gave a smile and said thank you, and continued working on his project. Little did I know, that what I allowed to be created, would be my destruction. Thor would place 2 humans onto Earth.

He would create light, and dark. He created what you would know as the "Garden Of Eden". And he placed "The Tree Of Knowledge" onto that garden. Often times, the others would check on Thor's little creation, and take turns meeting

Adam and Eve. One specific goddess, one you humans don't know of, Ena, went down to Earth. She, in your terms, would be the Goddess Of Envy. She was jealous of Thor's little creation. She knew she couldn't surpass what he did,

and, in a heat of rage, placed The Forbidden Fruit onto the Tree Of Knowledge. She then went to Thor, and in his sleep, sent him into a state of dissociation. He transformed into the serpent, and tempted Eve to take a bite

of the Forbidden Fruit. This would release all of the sins known to mankind. And it forever changed the planet Earth. When Thor awoke, he was in a rage upon learning what he had done. He found Ena, and nearly beat her to death.

It took Loki to snap him out of it, and Thor, too angry to even be near any god, took his project, and left what you call Heaven. I did not see my son for millions of years. I searched throught the cosmos, every galaxy, every

universe, for him, but alas, he was always one step ahead to never be found. I punished Ena by creating a realm, and sending her into the deepest pits of what is known as "Hell." It is not the same as told in the stories, though.

Humans cannot access it, as it her own torment. The afterlife you humans have is nothing more than a flash. Yes, reincarnation is real. My son hated the idea of only one go at this vast, unique world. But knowing humanity could

not know divinity, he made it to where you couldn't remember your flash of the afterlife. And as you aged, your past life would fade away, but there is a chance physical markings would remain on your new body. Your soul, for instance,

has lived thousands of lifetimes, under different names, under different genders, under different morals. You may not know who you used to be, and you never will, but it is all just a loop afterall. Anyways, centuries would pass

before I'd see my son again. Thor would visit my throne, and he'd look vastly different. He'd tell me the stories of him sending himself down as a human, named Jesus. He'd tell me of the Greek, the writing of The Constitution, 

of all of humanity up to the most recent of that time, the 1980's. He'd tell me of the music, the style, the politics. Thor was fascinated by the way humanity grew, and even though he was saddened by his crucifixtion as

Jesus Christ, he was happy to see that a fraction of humanity recognized his true goal. He departed from me, saying he would see me again when an insane thing happened. Some time flew by, and he returned. 

But not the same. He was rough. Cold. He looked like he been through, as what humans call it, hell. He told me that humanity has become a cancer. Something that he could not control anymore. He told me he needed my help.

He wanted to reset his project, see if he could fix things. I told him I couldn't help, as it was his duty as their god to do so. He shouted at me, saying I was a lazy king, and cowardly for not taking any action.

I asked him what is the matter with him, and how dare he speak to me that way, and he just groaned. He said he was tired of the "same old bull shit". He looked at me, and asked, "Have you ever wondered if somebody

overpowered you?" I looked at him, astonished. "No." He chuckled, and suddenly, chains were around my neck, around my legs, my arms. I couldn't move. He had the higher authority. "You know, for so long, I always wondered, why

were we equal to you. Why weren't you more powerful, despite being the KING OF ALL GODS?! Then I realized, we have no limit. We just never tested it." I begged him to stop, but he wouldn't listen. He grabbed my throat and

forced my eyes onto his. "Father tell me, when you see me, what do you see? Your son? Or your replacement?" I couldn't speak. It was not my son anymore. It was something, demonic. That's when it all came together.

Ena, despite being in Hell, still had her ways of manipulation. I peered into Thor's mind, and saw the truth. She asked Thor to Hell, to rekindle their relationship, and become true brother and sister again. He obliged,

and she took hold of his soul. She cursed him, with this twisted version of what he once was. She decided if she couldn't have his creation, then no one can. He shut me out, and gave me a choice. "I can either wipe you

from existence. You'll never see the heavens, the beautiful cosmos again. Or you can help me reset this world, and in return, I'll give you a place. Something to be." I chose the latter. I watched as he grabbed Earth,

and twisted it's form. Neon colors petruded from it, and next thing you know, it was nothing. Then he grabbed a single speck of color, and twisted it into a new Earth. He rewound the same events as prior, but with one

difference. He became the serpent. He brought sins into this new world. And I, now known as Lucifer, was cast to blame. I sat in a prison, under the Earth, for milennia. While the same events repeated, I sat under in torment.

My other children, have hid away from Thor, as he took over Heaven. Ena, at this point, could be with him, I do not know. All I know is that one random day, a gateway opened up to me. I walked through it, and ended up here.

You are the only person who can even believe me when I say that there is divine chaos here. And I send a warning that I'm hoping you can ripple. Do we have a deal, father?.
