This all started a few months ago. It was really small things at first, like stuff that anyone could dismiss as nothing, and I did, at first.

There was light tapping on the walls in the middle of the night, and I would notice things being displaced around the house (I'm extremely forgetful, so it wouldn't be a surprise it I was the one misplacing them).
Pretty quickly though the tapping became more focused and happened during the day. It actually sounded like someone was using their fingers to tap on the walls, and it would seem to be coming from just around the corners in the house, as if someone was standing there just out of view. Of course as soon as I would get up to investigate it would stop immediately and nobody would be there.

But my breath was taken away the night that I finally saw something. I was on my bed, watching TV when I heard the tapping again. I looked at the source of the noise, almost getting used to it by now and not really being fazed by it. However, just as I looked over, I could see what looked like a black silhouette with these huge eyeballs with black pupils, and as soon as I spotted it, it backed up around the corner disappearing from my sight.

It all happened so fast it was kind of hard to really figure out what I saw, but I remember my heart absolutely sinking when I saw it. For a few seconds I couldn't move, but I finally gathered up the nerve to get up, and I couldn't find anyone in the house. I searched literally everywhere.

Then the craziest thing happened, nothing at all. For about 3 or 4 weeks, nothing odd happened in that house.
I didn't hear the tapping, nothing was misplaced. I started to feel somewhat normal again. I somehow rationalize that whatever it was, since I finally noticed it, perhap V decided to stop. At the time it made sense to me that I wanted to mess with me, and since its cover was blown, it had to move on.

But I was so wrong. All of the sudden one night, I was on my laptop doing whatever, and I heard the tapping again.

Just knowing what I saw the last time I looked, I couldn't bring my self to look in the direction. I was frozen. It stopped after a few seconds, but I was on edge the rest of the night, and truly from then on I was constantly nervous.

Before I knew it things were getting truly out of hand. The TV would turn on in the middle of the night with max volume. I would hear footsteps walk, and sometimes run down my hallway. It wasn't long before I started to see it again. It was popping up more and more, sometimes out of the corner of my eye, and sometimes right in front of me. I was going to bed every single night as a sweaty nervous wreck. One time I even caught it peeking over the foot of my bed at me while I was trying to fall asleep.

It all came to a boiling point the day before yesterday. I had already seen the thing about 4 or 5 times in the last few hours, and I was shaking, in a more anxious state then ever. Then finally, after all this time, I heard it speak.

I felt a cool, no, a freezing cold breath on my cheek and simultaneously I heard a whisper in my ear "I'm here"
I couldn't take it. I bolted, heading towards the door, the only think I could think to do was run. It was just pure instinct to stay alive at this point, but as soon as I started running, I felt it gaining on me. It was right on my heel and I mean as close as it could possibly be. I ran outs into the street, and before I knew it, I was face down on the concrete, bleeding all over. I looked up to see a truck stopped in front me, and a man getting out to check on me.

It was about that time I realized what had happened. The last thing I saw before blacking out was that thing peeking outside my window, looking at me.
I'm in the hospital now, luckily the damage wasn't tremendous, but I do have quite a few bruises, cuts, and an overall shitty feeling. I'm going to be in here for a little while.
