The solitary figure staggered along the trail. Every few steps, he would sway and veer into the brush to either side, or pause, hands on knees, head lolling, before forcing himself on.

The sentry called an alert as soon as he saw the figure solidify from the heat-haze, and recognized his uniform. A wagon was dispatched, a medic riding shotgun. After giving him a canteen, the driver and medic together lifted the man into the wagon, then turned around and rode at full gallop to the fort.

“Begging your pardon, Colonel sir!” The private snapped a credible salute from the doorway. The gleaming brass plaque on the open door next to him read ‘Col. Thomas Aloysius Morden.’

The owner of the plaque and the name inscribed looked up from his desk. Bluish smoke wreathed his head, curling up from the pipe clenched between his lips. He took a draw from it, and clouds billowed from his mouth as he answered. “Speak, soldier.”

The private shifted his balance from one boot to the other. “Well sir, the squad you sent out to harass the savages….”

Colonel Morden’s chair creaked as he leaned back. “Ah yes,” he recalled, “Lieutenant Galloway’s men. I take it they send news?” He held out a hand in expectation of something written.

“Um, not as such, sir,” the private hedged, face twisted in distress.

Colonel Morden frowned. “They took losses?” he demanded, eyes turned downward toward his desk. “That doesn’t make sense. That village wasn’t supposed to have any fighters.” His gaze snapped up to the private again. “How bad is it? Did the Lieutenant survive?”

“Doc Thorogood thinks you ought to come see for yourself, sir,” the private blurted. “He’s in the infirmary with the survivor.” His eyes bulged as he realized his own slip.

“Survivor?” Colonel Morden roared, springing to his feet with such force that his chair skidded back to fetch up against the window-sill behind him. “One survivor?” He rounded his desk and stormed toward the doorway. “Out of the way, private!”

The private dodged to one side as Colonel Morden quick-marched across the compound to the infirmary. “Thorogood!” he roared. “How is he?”

“Doc” Thorogood straightened and turned. His mutton-chop sideburns made his already wide face look spherical. “Exhausted,” he answered. “Dehydration, exposure, I’m not sure what else yet. I wouldn’t have called for you except he insisted.” He held up a hand. “But go easy if you want answers. He’s this close,” he held up a thumb and forefinger just barely apart from each other. “Push too hard, and we could lose him.”

“C-Colonel,” the soldier groaned. He tried to push himself up onto his elbows, but one arm refused to cooperate. “Colonel, I m-must report.” Though his eyelids sagged with fatigue, intensity burned in his eyes.

“All right, son,” Colonel Morden soothed. He slid a chair next to the cot and perched on it. “Take your time. What happened to the rest of your squad? To Lieutenant Galloway? Was it an ambush?”

The soldier shook his head. “No, sir,” he wheezed. “Wasn’t any resistance at all. Nobody to resist.” His gaze shifted to one side, features twisted in confusion. “No fighters. Just women, children, and old folk.” He looked up at the colonel. “Wasn’t there supposed to be armed resistance, sir?”

“Never mind that,” Colonel Morden counseled. “Did you carry out the mission?”

The soldier stared at Colonel Morden, sick realization in his eyes, then nodded slowly. “Yes, sir,” he confirmed. “Every Indian in that village was killed.”

Colonel Morden’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Well,” he grumbled, “there’s that, at least. Now, um, what’s your name, son?”

“Sutton, sir,” the soldier supplied. “Private Sutton.”

Colonel Morden nodded. “So everything went well at the village,” he summarized. “Was your squad ambushed on the way back?”

Private Sutton opened his mouth to answer, when his eyes flew open wide, focused on the infirmary’s open doorway. “No!” he screamed. “No, not me!” He floundered on the cot, legs flailing as if to gain purchase, to curl himself into a ball. “It wasn’t me! Please!”

Both the colonel and the medic turned to stare at the empty portal, then back at the panicked man on the cot. Private Sutton now had his legs tucked up against his chest and his head buried between them, arms wrapped over his head. He rocked back and forth, making small mewling noises.

“Private!” Colonel Morden shouted. He grabbed Private Sutton’s shoulder and shook it. “Pull yourself together, man! What happened to your squad?” Despite repeated demands and shaking, no further answers came forth. With a disgusted snort, Colonel Morden shoved the private hard enough to roll him onto his side, and rose from his seat. He turned to “Doc” Thorogood with a scowl. “Let me know if he starts making sense again,” he commanded, and stalked from the infirmary.

“Corporal Chavez!”

“Sir!” A swarthy whip of a man interrupted the tune he strummed on a guitar and sprang to attention. All conversation in the barracks ceased. Other soldiers not currently on duty looked up from their books, letters, or games, drawn by the urgency in their commander’s voice.

Colonel Morden locked his eyes on Corporal Chavez’s. “Corporal, you are to assemble a search team. We need to know what happened to Lieutenant Galloway and his squad, immediately.”

“Sir, yes sir!” Corporal Chavez snapped a precise salute. He waited until Colonel Morden turned and strode from the barracks, then turned his eyes to his fellow soldiers. “I need four men,” he announced. “Volunteers, or do I have to pick?”

An hour later, five horses and riders trotted from the fort. At Colonel Morden’s order, the gate, normally left open, swung shut behind them, the bar thrown. The sun had passed zenith, but several hours of daylight remained.

Harold “Doc” Thorogood sat at his desk, quill in hand. In front of him sprawled the infirmary log, Private Sutton’s condition the latest addition. The nib of the quill bent a little too much, and a blob of ink dripped on the page. “Doc” swore and reached for the blotter.

Thomas Aloysius Morden poured a dollop of whiskey into his coffee, the only thing that cut through the acid. Then he packed a fresh load of tobacco into his pipe, and reached for a match.

Horses in the stable snorted and shuffled nervous little dances in their stalls. “Easy!” urged the stablehand. He patted the nose of an especially frantic gelding, and reached in his pocket for a bit of rock candy.

Corporal Ernesto Chavez pulled on the reins with one hand, while he raised the other to signal a stop. He leaned forward in his saddle and squinted against the afternoon sun. “Think we found ‘em,” he murmured. He studied the landscape a moment more, then clucked at his mount and tapped heels to flanks. They rode on, into a shallow bowl that became a pond in the wet months.

No horses remained at the scene. No carcasses – either they were captured, or ran off on their own. Vultures hopped about, intent on what the coyotes had left. A sick-sweet stench hung heavy in the air, thick also with flies. Bedrolls lay in orderly fashion around the remains of a fire, lumpy and torn.

“Madre de dios,” Chavez prayed.

“Damn savages,” opined another soldier as he pulled alongside. The man’s jaw worked, and he ejected a thick stream of tobacco-stained saliva. “Ambush, sure enough. Took ‘em while they slept.” He turned his face toward Chavez. “Burial detail, Corporal?”

“A moment.” Chavez dismounted and dropped the reins. His horse complained, but she was well-trained; she stood where he left her. Vultures squawked and hopped clear as he picked his way among the bedrolls. He found Lieutenant Galloway’s hat next to one of the bedrolls closest to the coals, but had to guess that the remains in the roll were his. He continued his circuit of the campsite. “Seventeen,” he counted, “eighteen, nineteen….”

Chavez spun and sprinted back to his horse. “Bury them,” he ordered. “Bring back whatever effects you can salvage.”

The chewing soldier stared at him. “Yes, Corporal,” he acknowledged. “But where are you going?”

Chavez did not answer, but snapped the reins and gave his horse both heels. Dust billowed in his wake as he galloped in the direction of the fort.

Smoke rose like a beacon, thick and black. Chavez kept pace as the burning fort rose over the horizon. Shouts and screams came to his ears, though they dwindled as he came closer. He drew his pistol as he rode through the open gate, cocked it and took aim.

Private Sutton, smeared in soot and blood, bent over “Doc” Thorogood, busily sawing at the man’s scalp with a knife. “Saanii!” Sutton screamed. “Alchini!” He repeated the words with each stroke of the knife, while the medic screamed and flailed.

Chavez’s shot entered through Sutton’s left eye, and exited with the back of his skull trailing behind. Chavez leaped from his horse and jogged across the compound, pistol ready though he felt sure he had killed Sutton. “Doc!” he yelled, as he knelt next to the bleeding man.

“Doc” pressed both hands over his scalp, as if by doing so he could force the flopping swath of skin and hair back into place. “Crazy,” he whimpered, “he went crazy.”

Chavez shrugged off his jacket and wrapped it around “Doc’s” head. “Come on,” he urged, looping one arm under “Doc’s.” “Get you to the…” He looked around, and spotted the inferno that was once the infirmary. “Where’s the colonel?”

“Doc” staggered to his feet, most of his weight on Chavez. “Dead,” he slurred. “All dead. He wouldn’t stop, just kept on….” He jerked, back arched, mouth agape in a voiceless scream.

Chavez glimpsed movement behind them. He released “Doc” and spun, and stared into Sutton’s remaining eye. Sutton grinned at him, and yanked the knife from “Doc’s” back. “Saanii,” he growled, “alchini.”

Chavez had spent time among the Indians, enough to gain basic command of their language. He blinked as he translated Sutton’s words. “Women. Children.”

Sutton lunged, and Chavez drew his saber as he spun clear. He put aside the question of how the man still moved, whirled in a circle and put all the strength of his shoulder and torso to whip the blade at the back of Sutton’s neck. The edge bit and continued through. Sutton staggered a few drunken paces forward, as if to chase his head which bounced and rolled in the dirt. He dropped to one knee, then sprawled, a dark puddle spreading from his neck.

Corporal Chavez stared down at Private Sutton’s body. His gaze drifted further, to where the man’s head rested on its side, remaining eye open and staring. Motion caught his attention, and he snapped his focus to the gate of the fort.

Women.

Children.

Old people.

They stood in the open entry. They stared at him.

Chavez dropped to his knees. “I’m sorry,” was all he could offer.
