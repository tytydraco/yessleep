I know it's cliche to say "I SWEAR TO GOD GUYS THIS STORY IS TRUE" but I do want to clarify that this did in fact happen to me about a month ago.

So I have two dogs, and they tend to need to get up once or twice a night to go out and use the bathroom. Since I normally stay up pretty late, my parents rely on me to let them out. One night at about 11, my mom comes up to me and says "Hey OP, I just let Lucy (one of our dogs) outside, and I'm going to bed. Can you let her in in about half an hour." I gladly say sure, and go back to the movie I was watching (not that it matters, but the movie was Lupin III: the Last Job.)

As I'm finishing up the movie, I hear a distinct scratching sound. This wasn't cause for concern, as Lucy is still fairly young and doesn't always know to bark to let us know to let her in, and instead claws at the door. I hear it all the time and know what it sounds like. I look at the clock and realize that it's now midnight and I should have let her in a half hour ago. I jump up, go downstairs and to the front door, open it, and.... she's not there.

...okay, she probably just wandered off, but it's no big deal, our yard has a fence, it's not like she'll get out or anything, I'll just call her name and wait. So I do just that. But she doesn't come. I call her name louder, but all I'm met with is the cool void of the night. I call her a few more times before thinking "Do I really need to go out there and bring her in manually?" A little annoyed at this point, I throw on some shoes and grab a flashlight, and go outside to look for her.

Try as I might, I can't find her anywhere. But I know she's out there. She has to be. I search the entire yard and find nothing until it comes time to search a certain corner of the yard that's all the way in the back. There's no lights back there, so it's so dark than even the beam of my flashlight is devoured but the darkness. I tried to walk over there, but for some reason I just... couldn't. My body wouldn't let me. My mind was fully set on checking that little area, but my body just would not comply. I was frozen. I don't know why. I stood there, staring into the emptiness of the night. At this point the darkness began to feel suffocating. I couldn't stay out there any longer, it was too much. 

Eventually I mustered up the strength to go back inside. So I was relieved of my sense of foreboding, but I still didn't know where Lucy is. So I decide I need to go upstairs and consult my mom. I expected her to be pissed, since I shirked my responsibility, but I had to man up and do it. So I go to my parents room upstairs, wake up my mom and say "Hey, Lucy's still outside, right? You didn't let her in?" 

My mom, unconcerned, says "What do you mean? She's right here."

I look down and sure enough, there's Lucy, laying beside my parents's bed in that weird position she's always in, where she doesn't really understand how to tuck her legs in so she just sprawls out on her stomach with her hind legs extended out fully. Confused but relieved, I let my mom go back to sleep, leave my parents's room and go back to the living room and sit down on the couch. But as I sit there for a few minutes, I realize something strange and, honestly a little terrifying.

If Lucy was inside this whole time, then what was scratching on the door?
