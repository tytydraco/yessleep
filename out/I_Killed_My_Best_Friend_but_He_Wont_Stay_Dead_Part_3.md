[\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p484bz/i_killed_my_best_friend_but_he_wont_stay_dead/)

Frustration consumed the following days. I practically lived at John’s house. Over and over I returned, buried him and came back to find him alive.

The day after, I had asked Dahlia about the events again, and she swore to me that she didn't remember anything. Of course I didn’t tell her about it flat out, but I prodded for an answer and kept asking if she was absolutely sure until her tone turned frustrated like I hadn’t heard before. Every time I came back, I asked the following day, and the response was the same as the day before.

The absurdity of the situation didn’t allow me to process the outcome. I realized that I was trying to brute force it after the 10th day in a row. I was starting to lose track of where to dig to not accidentally unearth a different body. It became almost a force of habit, the initial fear of being caught overshadowed by the much larger issue. I smelled the permanent stench of blood and dirt in my nose. Whatever I ate tasted faintly of rotting flesh. The scent of death clung to my clothes and skin, I was sure, and I was also sure that people around me could smell it too. John most of all, he had a nose for that. So why wouldn’t he bring it up? Why was he letting me flail like a fish out of water? Would I need to point it out for him to notice, or was he genuinely unaware? I didn’t know, but I had briefly directed my anger at him when I had convinced myself that he knew, and just decided not to tell me. I can’t say that saving Dahlia was the only motivation behind killing him in the span of the last ten days.

Worst of all was the guilt. It would’ve surely caught up to me at some point, maybe one night at the beach with Dahlia. I was hoping it never would. But with my repeat attempts to kill him, the guilt came quicker than I could’ve ever anticipated. I didn’t remember John’s expression the first time I killed him. I shot him so quickly that he probably didn’t even realize what was happening. His face was blank to me, I couldn’t remember if I tried. But the more I repeated it, the clumsier and more frustrated I got, the more emotion I could remember from him. There was always confusion and shock that came first. Sometimes there was anger if he was alive for long enough. Never direct fear. He never begged or bargained for his life. Everything culminated in a look of betrayal that hit close to home. Just pure hatred for me.

I came home to John, wet with rain and sick with a rock at the bottom of my stomach. I wasn’t sure why I came back, except for the discomfort I felt in my own home. It was quiet when I sat alone, and I couldn’t get myself to open the blinds or turn on the lights. And in the dark, I had too much time to think about my predicament, and too much time to let my imagination conjure up futures that didn’t exist but made me feel as though they did. I was forced to choose the lesser evil. John was on the phone with someone, smiling and laughing how he did whenever he was ready to end a conversation. He gave me a wave when I entered and I stood by the door until he finished talking.

“‘Sup?” He asked. I should've expected to meet an oblivious version of John, but still, it shot a pain down my spine that almost made me lash out before I shut up completely. 

I decided to speak when he turned around after he didn't receive an answer. When I opened my mouth, instead of the excuse I'd revised in my car, I croaked out a disgusting sob that made my throat burn. I clasped my hand over my mouth, but it had been done and I could no longer hold back the tears. John came over to me, supporting me by my arms while I steadied my back against the door. Between gasps and pained moans I didn't manage to answer what was wrong. I didn't manage to look him in the eyes either. He was the last person I wanted to see, and still I found myself grasping his biceps. I locked eyes with Dahlia instead, who was standing by the kitchen, but I looked away immediately. He led me to the guest room and guided me to sit on the bed. Almost simultaneously, he sat next to me letting me cling to his body. I gasped and choked on my breakdown until I almost threw up, and continued wringing out apologies and pleas, during which John stroked my back and told me it was okay. It wasn't, and he was assuring me without even knowing what it was about. For the first time in my life, his confidence did nothing but make my anger boil. 

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, oh God, I’m sorry-”

“You don’t gotta be, it’s okay. Everything’s okay.”

I shook my head. “No, John, I-I killed you! I killed you, and I buried your body in the woods, b-but when I came back you were alive, and then I did it again, and I kept doing it, but every time you were alive in your house-” 

My garbled confession spilled from my lips, and judging by John’s confused and worried look, it was completely unbelievable. I desperately tried to pick up my explanation until John pushed his hands closer to my neck, giving a firmer squeeze.

“You didn’t, I’m okay-”

“I did! You never remember, but I did! Nobody remembers, I’m the only one who does! I shot you-”

“Okay,” He patted my shoulder with a more serious look. I gripped the fabric of his shirt tighter in a sudden rush of fear that he’d tell me to go home. He didn’t. He stroked a hand through my hair while seemingly organizing his thoughts with a sigh. “You need to calm down, okay? Whatever you’re thinking right now, it’s not real. You didn’t kill me, *obviously*.” He gestured to himself and he let a small unsure chuckle slip. “Look at me, dude, I’m alive… God, you’re shaking.”

I couldn’t keep my emotions at bay. I insisted on explaining and he insisted on telling me it was okay and that I had to calm down, until he pushed me down on the bed and I found his lips on mine. My tongue was dead against his moving one, stiff from the surprise, but that didn’t deter him. He took my clinging to his body as a sign to continue. I could’ve pushed him off, but I didn’t feel the immediate need to. I simply gasped when he kissed me, surprised, but that was all. Whenever I tried to pick the topic back up between kisses, he shushed me, but not in a condescending way. Authoritative, yes, but not condescending. He gently caressed my body and repeated *‘it’s okay’* like a mantra until I let myself forget the world for a brief, pleasurable moment in which I reciprocated his actions. We didn’t fuck, not directly, but I didn’t know of another way to describe it. Maybe it was an unconventional way to ground me or to show me that he was not angry at me, or maybe he just wanted me to shut up. Either way, his attempt to take my mind off the stress had worked, if only for the duration in which he pleasured me. John’s eagerness had confused me, but at the same time felt natural. His solution was only temporary, though. On top of everything else, the thought of what our relationship from here on out would be like muddled my already frantic thoughts. 

John's hand was warm on my skin and traced a soothing touch over my chest. I laid beneath him, caged by his muscled arms but not smothered, even when he rested part of his weight on me. One thing he had managed to do was get me to stop hyperventilating.

“Feelin' better?” He asked, sounding satisfied with himself. It’d been a nice distraction, but now he brought my mind back to the topic. He just couldn't keep his mouth shut for more than five minutes. I didn’t reply long enough for him to speak again. “No?”

“No, no, I feel…” I paused. “You were really good.” I never knew what to say after sex. The fact that it was with John didn’t change it. He chuckled.

"Aren't you a charmer?”

I heard him huff out his laugh against my neck. It gave me goosebumps that ran all the way down to my arms, which he stroked his fingers over, smoothing them out. I was embarrassed that he could see them. With my back to him, my mind started decaying the image I had of John, until the thought of his rotten corpse spooning me got so intense I had to roll over and look at him. He was alive, and his neck smelled of his bougie cedarwood cologne and fresh sweat. He didn’t reek of death at all. My sudden movement startled John.

“You alright there?”

“Yeah, yeah.” I muttered with wide eyes studying his face. I was doing my best to relax, but he gave me a pitiful smile.

“You’re all jumpy. Still worried about… that stuff from before?” He was obviously unsure how to address it, and I couldn’t fault him. I must’ve sounded insane. Maybe he was hesitant about bringing it up again, in fear of the mental breakdown repeating. Even so, he kept up his idle movement and spoke in the calmest tone he could muster. It almost made me forget what we were talking about.

“...a bit.”

John acknowledged me with a nod. “You should stop thinking about it. Try and get your mind off of things. You’re fine. How about we have a nice evening? Get drunk on some wine, hm?”

“Sounds good, yeah.” I was too tired to argue with his lackluster advice. Instead I just nodded and cleared my throat. “Johnny?”

“Yeah?”

“How long have you… I mean- is this a one-off thing, or…?”

“Do you want it to be more?” I found myself nodding without thinking too much about it. John smiled at me. “I figured you would.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Eh, you know," He shrugged with a grin. "You’ve always been kinda-”

“Shut up.” I rolled my eyes as he chuckled and gave him a kick which only made him laugh louder. I watched him stretch and sit up, ready to get out of bed. "Where are you going?” I pushed myself up with too much urgency. John smiled and gently pushed me back down, pulling a pillow closer so I could rest my head on it.

“I’ll be right back. Gonna put Dahlia to bed and then you’ll have me all to yourself, alright?” He leaned down to press a kiss on my head and got up. “Stay.” He didn’t bother to put on his shirt as he left the room.

The mention of Dahlia shot a current through my body. She had slipped my mind somehow, and now that I remembered the world beyond the bedroom door, I shifted uncomfortably. The thought of her finding out about this filled me with shame. Would she give me some slack? I wondered if she would understand that he came onto me, and not the other way around. I quickly decided I wasn’t going to find out. I wasn't going to overcomplicate the situation with this. I'd be dumb to let *this* John live. All it'd do is be a reminder that I once again failed to find a solution. And when he would be dead, so would be this whole thing. No cheating, it might as well have not happened at all, even if Dahlia found out right now. Why had I even let him do it in the first place? The question lingered in my mind for a bit more until I slowly pushed myself up.

I was up and ready to get it over with, and while replaying the time with John, something clicked in my mind. Him being so close with me tonight cemented the fact that, no matter what I did, John would be alive. Whatever had blessed my friend with immortality, and simultaneously cursed me with it, I had no idea. I would have approached the problem by its root, if I had a single hint of what it was. But I knew that I couldn’t let emotions cloud my rationale, and I also knew that I was growing increasingly less comfortable with the intimacy John and I had just had. It was distracting. In a fit of post-nut clarity, before I had the opportunity to hesitate, I plunged a kitchen knife in his shoulder. Normally he would've been stronger, but his shock stunned him and allowed me to penetrate his neck, over and over until it left a raw convulsing pulp of flesh. From his upper lip down to his abdomen, his skin was drenched in the red liquid that spilled from his neck and mouth. I looked away as he twitched on the floor and didn't bother fighting the hands that were trying to inflict damage in a last futile struggle. I pushed them away with a gentle motion. It took uncomfortably long until the gurgling below me finally stopped. The blood still trickled, but his eyes had rolled back in his head and didn’t budge further.

I found my hearing muffled and noticed a sound that I couldn’t assign to anything coming from John. When I looked up, I realized it was a gasp from Dahlia. I locked eyes with her. I didn’t have time for this.

“Go-... go to your room, please. I’ll be right there, okay?” She didn’t budge. I watched her slowly look down at John’s body. “Dahlia,” I was firmer this time, maybe too firm. “go to your room.”

It worked this time and she disappeared back into the hallway. A door slammed shut.

The blood had spread over the mahogany and seeped into the white carpet. I wouldn’t clean up this time. My hands were dry and chapped from all the bleach anyway. I simply changed out of my bloody clothes, borrowing some of John’s that he wouldn’t immediately recognize as his own, dragged his body outside and loaded him onto my truck. Rinse and repeat, I found a spot and pushed John’s half-naked body into another shallow grave. I lingered on the sight of him until I reached down and closed his eyes before covering him. Finally forcing myself to pull away, I left with a cigarette between my lips and drove back on autopilot. The ride passed in the blink of an eye before I parked my car in front of his house again. This time, I saw him on his front porch, leaning on the railing while smoking. He nodded in my direction as a greeting. 

“Evenin’.” He said as I came closer. He was elevated, with the porchlight illuminating him from behind and plunging his face in shadow. I felt the need to look away as I climbed the stairs.

“Hi.”

“Everything okay with you?” He asked with a raised brow, looking me up and down. I felt a burning in my throat and swallowed it down thickly. “You look like shit.”

“Yeah, thanks,” I mumbled. “I’m just tired.”

“What else is new?” He joked.

The blood was where I had left it when we went inside, now starting to take on a muddy brown shade as opposed to the scarlet black. John noticed, and I watched him stop with a confused expression.

“What the fuck?” His mouth moved without producing any actual words. He looked at me. “What the fuck is that?”

I shrugged, trying to look as surprised as I could. “Don't look at me...”

“I *swear* I have no idea how I got there.” He scrunched his nose at the smell, staring at the blood and looking for its source.

“Did you forget to clean up?”

“No?” He took on a defensive tone and I could tell he was about to argue. If my life had been normal, I would’ve argued back, maybe even started the argument. I felt bad for lying, but I obviously couldn’t tell him the truth. “Dahlia!” He called into the house and a moment later she sheepishly peered in from the hallway, just like she had when I had stabbed him. John didn’t have to tell her what he wanted. The blood immediately caught her attention and she pressed a hand to her mouth and nose to block out the stench. He went over to her to check for injuries and I heard them discuss the mysterious blood. I stood back, staring at it until John came back.

“And?”  
  
“She’s fine. She said she didn’t hear anything...” He was staring at me, surprisingly unsure of the situation, and somehow himself. “Have you-?”

“*When*, John? I just got here.” My irritation was visible, and I was grateful for once. It helped me act more natural. John looked at the blood again, huffing. “Maybe you seriously just… forgot to clean up?” I offered again.

“I think I’d remember.” He snapped.

“Yeah, but-” I stopped myself from letting the conversation continue. “Whatever, we should take care of it.”

I ended up helping him get rid of the carpet. We talked about it while I feigned ignorance, but at some point he thankfully let it go. I stayed over that night again, this time sleeping on the couch.
