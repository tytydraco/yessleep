Case File: #2023-109  
Date: September 25, 2023

This report documents a significant development in our ongoing investigation into \[REDACTED\] in rural areas, previously believed to be unrelated. A recent \[REDACTED\] these cases. Ms. Varn was found in a severely weakened state and is currently receiving medical care.

During an interview conducted on September 24, 2023, \[REDACTED\]. The following is a summary of the pertinent details disclosed during the interview.

\*Officer Smith\*: Good afternoon, Miss. Varn. I'm Officer Smith. I’m here to ask a few questions about what happened during your stay at Victor and Eleanor Hartley’s mansion. Could you please tell me what your relationship to them is?

\*Samantha\*: (quietly) Victor and Eleanor are close friends of my boyfriend, Michael Booth.

\*Officer Smith\*: How long have you and Michael been together?

\*Samantha\*: About a year.

\*Officer Smith\*: Thank you. Now, I understand this might be difficult, but we need to know what happened in that mansion. Can you tell me about the events leading up to your escape?

\*Samantha\*: (pauses, visibly distressed) I... I can't. It's all a blur. I'm sorry.

\*Officer Smith\*: That's okay, Samantha. I understand this must be traumatic. If you can't verbally recount it, would you be willing to write it down for us? It might help us understand what occurred.

\*Samantha\*: (nods) Yes, I'll try.

Part One of Samantha Varn’s written account of the events:

I sat in the passenger seat of Michael’s truck as we barreled down a winding, tree-lined road that seemed to lead to nowhere. We'd been dating for over a year, but this was my first visit to where he’d grown up. Michael barely visited the east coast anymore since his parents passed away years ago, but his best friends Eleanor and Victor still lived in the area.

We came up to a secluded mansion deep in the heart of the woods. Its imposing façade loomed before us, both grand and eerie, its design reminiscent of Gothic Revival. Towering stone turrets reached towards the heavens, their gray stone blocks rising in a mesmerizing pattern. Ivy, lush and green, clung to the aged walls, weaving against the stone.

To say I was surprised would be an understatement. Micheal had told me that Eleanor came from old money, and that she and Victor had inherited her family’s home, but I had imagined a more traditional family estate. The sheer opulence of the mansion was beyond my expectations.

As we parked the truck, Michael turned to me with a reassuring smile. "I know it's a bit overwhelming, Sam, but I promise you'll love it here. Eleanor and Victor are like family to me."

At the same time, Eleanor and Victor stepped out to greet us. I'd met them multiple times in the past when they visited Michael. We lived states away, but they visited often. Eleanor, a small and elegant woman with dark hair swept up into a vintage style, stepped forward with a welcoming smile.

"Welcome, Samantha," she extended her arms toward me. "It's a pleasure to finally have you here."

"Thank you for having me," I replied, smiling as she pulled me in for a hug.

Victor nodded in acknowledgment, his blue eyes holding mine with a steady, unwavering gaze. "Yes, welcome, both of you."

Michael gave me an encouraging smile, wrapping an arm around my waist. “I thought it was about time I brought her around.”

“We’re always thrilled when you come home.” Eleanor took her friend's hand, beaming up at him fondly.

Victor stepped towards the truck, “I’ll help you carry everything in, Mike.” He patted my boyfriend on the shoulder.

Once the men gathered the bags, I followed Michael and his childhood friends into the mansion, passing through the massive wooden doors that closed with a heavy thud behind us.

The mansion's interior was a testament to a life of privilege. Sparkling chandeliers hung from the high ceilings, casting a golden glow over the ornate furnishings. Beneath our feet was a polished marble floor, and before us stood a grand staircase with a sweeping banister.

"Your room is this way." Eleanor gestured up the stairs, her voice filled with warmth. At the top, we walked down a long corridor lined with portraits of stern-faced figures who I assumed were Eleanor’s ancestors.

We reached the end of the hall, and Eleanor opened the door to reveal what I could only assume was her childhood bedroom. I was shocked by the normalcy of it. The décor was a stark difference from the grandeur I had seen elsewhere in the mansion, and it was as if I had stepped into a time capsule of her youth.

The space was filled with remnants of girlhood. A well-loved teddy bear sat in one corner, and posters of '90s pop stars adorned the walls. There were stacks of books, some with well-worn spines, and a vintage record player stood proudly on a wooden desk.

Eleanor chuckled at my reaction. "I couldn’t bear to change it," she explained with a hint of nostalgia.

“That’s very sweet.” I smiled, amused as I tried to reconcile the image of the opulent mansion with the room that felt so ordinary and nostalgic.

Michael and Victor arrived with the bags, and as they set them down, Michael chuckled at the room. "Yeah, we've all got our own little time capsules in this place. It's like a journey through our memories every time we visit." He nudged Victor with an elbow, “Remember what happened in 73?”

The two shared a hearty laugh and Victor nudged him with an elbow, “Ah, who could forget. You know, our old rope ladder is still in there ‘till this day.”

Eleanor and Victor told us they’d be waiting for us in the back garden whenever we were finished settling in, and with that, they left the room, giving us some privacy to unpack and freshen up.

While Michael and I carried on our conversation and unpacked our bags, I decided to text my mom to let her know we’d arrived safely. To my surprise, my phone had no reception whatsoever, and I couldn't access my data. Perplexed, I turned to Michael and inquired about the Wi-Fi password.

Michael's expression turned apologetic as he shook his head. "Sorry, Sam. There isn't any Wi-Fi here. We've always enjoyed being disconnected from the outside world when we visit."

I sighed, realizing that I wouldn't be able to communicate with my mom or access the outside world during our stay. I was also confused, wondering why Michael hadn’t mentioned this sooner. It was a strange feeling, being completely disconnected in a world so reliant on technology.

But Michael seemed to sense my concern and rested a hand on my shoulder. "I know it's a bit inconvenient, but trust me, it's also part of the charm of this place. It's like stepping back in time."

I tried to smile, appreciating his attempt to ease my worries. "It's okay, Michael. I can survive a few days without Wi-Fi. It'll be a nice break from the constant notifications and emails."

As the night continued, we all settled into a comfortable rhythm of conversation and laughter. The back garden, bathed in the soft glow of lanterns, was truly enchanting. The fragrance of blooming flowers filled the air as we sipped on wine, and Eleanor regaled us with stories of her childhood adventures in the garden, like hidden treasure hunts and secret picnics.

I was a couple glasses deep when a man dressed in chef’s attire arrived with a silver tray, carrying an assortment of dishes. My eyes widened, and I shared a glance with Michael who simply winked.

Eleanor, her eyes sparkling with delight, revealed the secret. "I thought we could have a special dinner under the stars tonight, just like old times. So, I asked Chef Laurent to prepare something delightful for us."

As the night grew late, we decided to retire to our respective rooms. The enchantment of the evening lingered in the air, but the sense of contentment and warmth dissipated as I prepared for bed.

Michael fell asleep the moment his head hit the pillow, meanwhile I lay awake, my gaze fixed on the ceiling of the dimly lit room. My stomach churned and ached, the room feeling uncomfortably warm. I peeled off the blankets, leaving only a sheet to cover me.

I accursed myself for overindulging. After such a long day travelling, my stomach was likely protesting the rich meal and wine we had enjoyed.

I tossed and turned for a few more hours, only falling into a fitful sleep when the first rays of dawn began to creep through the curtains.

\~

The next morning, I awoke feeling as though I hadn’t slept at all. Michael’s side of the bed was empty, which told me it must be past 8am, since he always went for a run at 7:30. I groggily rubbed my eyes and pushed myself to sit up.

The morning light bathed the room in a gentle, golden hue, but I couldn't appreciate its beauty. My head throbbed, and my stomach still ached.

Pushing through the pain, I dressed and ventured out of the room, hoping to find Michael or some indication of where he had gone.

I descended a grand staircase, following the path towards the back garden that Michael had shown me last night. As I grew closer, the smell of tea and toast wafted through the air, and I changed course to find my way into the kitchen.

To my surprise, Victor and Eleanor were busy at work, cooking up a morning feast. Victor expertly handled a sizzling pan, while Eleanor moved gracefully around the kitchen, setting a table for breakfast. Michael, newspaper in hand, sat in front of the window, seemingly engrossed in its contents.

"Morning," I mumbled, my voice hoarse from the restless night.

Eleanor turned with a warm smile. "Good morning, Samantha. Sleep well?"

I hesitated for a moment, not wanting to burden them with my restlessness. "Not as well as I'd hoped, but I'm sure a cup of coffee will fix that."

Victor chuckled as he flipped a piece of bacon. "You've come to the right place. Eleanor's a wizard with the French press."

As I reached for the steaming coffee that Eleanor had prepared, I glanced at Michael, who had yet to look up from his newspaper. There was a sense of detachment about him that was unusual. I wondered if he, too, was feeling unsettled.

It was only when my stomach pinched and rumbled that he finally looked up from the newspaper in his hands. Michael laughed, “Why don’t I give you a tour? Help kill some time before we eat?”

I considered it. Perhaps a tour would get my mind off things? I’d always been an anxious person; a bit of a hypochondriac, really. And if I kept fixating on my head and stomach, I might ruin what was meant to be a pleasant morning with friends. I nodded at Michael's suggestion, trying to push aside my unease. "Sure, a tour sounds great. Let's do it."

Together, we left the cozy kitchen and explored the labyrinthine corridors and grand rooms while Michael shared stories of his childhood. I did my best to immerse myself in his voice, but the sprawling mansion's layout felt like a maze with no clear sense of direction. Each hallway and room seemed to blend into the next, and it was easy to get disoriented. I wondered how Michael could remember where he was going.

We were in the library, wandering through the rows of bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes and antique manuscripts when I spotted something strange. My gaze had been fixed on Michael as he regaled me with the history of the room. But as I listened to him, my attention momentarily shifted to a section of the wall near the back of the library.

There, nestled among the meticulously arranged books, was some paneling that seemed slightly off-kilter, as if it didn't quite align with the rest of the wall.

I became fixated on this anomaly, Michael’s voice fading into the background. In a house that seemed to prioritize perfection, how could such a blemish remain unaddressed?

"Michael," I began tentatively, my eyes still locked on the irregularity in the wall, "have you ever noticed that section of the paneling over here? It looks a bit... out of place, don't you think?"

He turned to follow my gaze, his expression unchanging as he surveyed the area I was pointing to. "What section are you talking about, Sam? Everything looks perfectly fine to me."

I furrowed my brow, puzzled by his response. It was so glaringly obvious, how could he not see it? I took a step closer and pointed directly at the misaligned paneling. "Right there."

Michael let out an exaggerated sigh and chuckled softly, as though humouring a child. "Sam, you always had an overactive imagination. There's nothing there but books and the wall. Maybe you're just tired."

I turned back to the oddity in the wall and reached out to touch it, my fingers grazing the slightly raised edge of the wood panel.

Michael's laughter ceased abruptly, and his cheerful demeanour vanished. "Sam, I think you should drop it." His eyes bore into mine with a strange intensity.

I withdrew my hand, startled by his sudden change in demeanour. "I don't understand. Are you seriously saying you can't see this?"

He sighed deeply and shook his head, his features a mask of indifference. "Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about. Now, let's get back to the tour. There's so much more to see."

I opened my mouth to protest, but a voice echoed from the hallway outside the library. It was Eleanor, calling us to breakfast.

Michael and I made our way to the dining room, where the tantalizing aroma of eggs, bacon, and freshly baked pastries greeted us. I forgot about the strange wood panelling as soon as I sat down.

“So where exactly are you from in Oregon, Samantha?” Victor asked as he shovelled hashbrowns onto his fork, “I apologize, I always seem to forget the name.”

I replied with a smile, "I'm from a small town called Ashford in southern Oregon. It's a quiet place, not too far from Crater Lake."

Victor nodded as if he were familiar with the area. "Ah, Ashford. Beautiful country down there, I've heard."

"Yes, it is," I agreed with a nod, "Lots of hiking trails."

"Oh, is that so?” Eleanor swallowed a bite of French toast, “I hadn’t realized you came from such a remote area.”

"Oh yes," I replied with a half smile, "there are definitely some remote areas around Ashford. The forests and national parks can be quite secluded."

Eleanor nodded, taking a sip of orange juice as she shared a conspicuous glance with her husband.

"Tell us, Samantha, do you have a lot of family in Ashford itself or do they live in the outskirts?" Victor continued, reaching for a piece of bacon.

I hesitated, perplexed by the wording of his question. "Um, most of my family lives in town. It's nice, especially since it’s a small place. Everyone knows each other."

Victor leaned forward; his eyes locked onto mine. "And what about friends? Do they live in town as well?”

I furrowed my brow, growing increasingly uncomfortable and confused with the direction of the questions. I couldn’t fathom why they were so interested in the geographical details of my hometown.

"Well, some friends enjoy the outdoors, so they might go camping in the more remote spots from time to time.” I chewed my bottom lip. “Why do you ask?"

Eleanor smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Oh, it's just that we find remote places so fascinating. The sense of solitude, the quiet.”

“We’re always looking for new places we could invest in property.” Victor added quickly.

Michael seemed to sense my unease and came to my rescue, redirecting the conversation away from the unusual line of questioning. I appreciated his support, and the tension in the room seemed to ease as we talked about more mundane topics.

Afterwards, I headed back to Eleanor’s childhood bedroom with Michael when he changed out of his running gear.

"Michael," I began, sitting on the edge of the bed as I watched him, "what was with those questions earlier? What’s so special about the remote areas around Ashford?"

I could have sworn Michael's face darkened slightly, and he hesitated before answering. "I'm sorry about that, Sam. Eleanor and Victor can be a bit intense sometimes. They have their quirks, but they mean well."

Michael's response only confused me further, but I chose not press the matter further. I trusted him, and if he said that Eleanor and Victor could be a bit intense at times, I was willing to take his word for it.

As he finished changing, he joined me on the edge of the bed. “Are you feeling alright?” He asked, scanning my face, “You’re looking a bit pale.”

“Oh it’s nothing.” I shook my head, pushing the anxious thoughts out of my mind. “I had a bit of a stomachache after dinner last night so I couldn’t sleep. But that breakfast was fantastic. I just needed some good food to chase away the cobwebs."

Michael seemed to relax, his worry dissipating as I spoke. "Good to hear. Just let me know if you need anything, okay? We can take it easy today if you're not up for too much exploring."

Agreeing that some fresh air might be good for me, we planned to take a walk through the beautiful gardens and perhaps indulge in some outdoor activities.

Eleanor and Victor had set up a variety of yard games, and we spent hours playing, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. It was a perfect day, and for a while, I managed to forget about my earlier discomfort. But by late afternoon, I could no longer ignore the fever that had taken hold of me. My body ached, and a shiver ran down my spine despite the warmth of the day. Michael noticed my discomfort and immediately suggested that we head back inside.

I awoke late that night, disoriented and drenched in sweat. Around me, the room was shrouded in darkness, the only illumination coming from the faint moonlight filtering through the curtains.

Instinctively, I shifted closer to Michael, seeking comfort in his presence as my anxious gaze darted around the room. In the dim light, the antique furniture's delicate silhouettes swayed with a spectral quality. Despite my rational efforts to dispel the notion, I couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that the furniture itself was staring back at me.

I reached for the nightstand with trembling hands, fumbling for my anxiety medication. But of course, this wasn’t my nightstand, and my Ativan wasn’t there.

Desperation forced me to act. I needed relief from the fever that burned through my body and the anxiety that gnawed at my mind. Summoning every ounce of courage within me, I steeled myself to cross the hall and head to the bathroom.

I slipped noiselessly out from under the sheets, and I gently placed my feet on the cool, wooden floor. As I stood, the glint of something red in the corner of the room caught my eye, and I froze in place, puzzled. Clearly, my anxiety was running wild, and my eyes were playing tricks on me.

The corridor that had seemed never-ending during the day was even more daunting in the night's shroud. I swallowed and clutched the edge of my nightgown, my knuckles turning white. The bathroom was down the hall, its door partially ajar, with the faint glow from a nightlight seeping through.

I inched forward, my heart pounding in my chest as moonlight from adjacent corridors cast elongated shadows that seemed to reach out for me like skeletal fingers. The oppressive silence was broken only by the faint rustle of my nightgown and the echo of my own shallow breaths.

As I approached the bathroom door, I caught a glimpse of movement from the corner of my eye. A tall, shadowy figure stood at the far end of the branching hallway, just beyond the pool of feeble light from the windows.

Fear clenched my chest, and my breath caught in my throat. Without a moment's hesitation, I flung myself into the bathroom and slammed the door shut behind me. It looked like a person, what if-

No, no, no.

This was ridiculous.

I was letting my fever and anxiety play tricks on my mind. Maybe it was a trick of the moonlight, a play of shadows and shapes in the dimly lit mansion.

With shaking hands, I rummaged through my toiletry bag on the counter, searching for my Ativan and some Advil. This was just a fever, a bout of anxiety, and an unfamiliar environment all conspiring to make me feel this way. There was nothing more to it.

Returning to the bedroom, I slid back into bed beside Michael, who was still fast asleep, blissfully unaware of my feverish adventure.

\~

The next morning arrived with the gentle rays of sunlight filtering through the curtains. As I slowly opened my eyes, I realized once again that Michael had already gotten up for the day.

Stretching my limbs and slipping out of bed, I followed the scent of breakfast wafting through the air, arriving once more at the mansion's grand kitchen.

I could hear the low murmur of voices, and just as I reached the doorway, I caught the very end of a hushed conversation between Eleanor and Victor.

Eleanor's voice was tinged with urgency as she said, "…we can't afford any mistakes now.”

“We won’t make any.” Victor replied, “It’s almost time.”

I stepped into the room to see that Victor was already seated, and Eleanor stood in the kitchen, buttering two pieces of toast.

“Good morning.” She said cheerfully.

"Good morning, Eleanor," I replied with a polite smile, taking a seat at the table.

Victor greeted me with a nod, his expression somewhat distant.

"Is Michael out for his morning run?" I asked, trying to sound casual, while inside, my mind was still grappling with the cryptic conversation I had overheard.

Eleanor nodded as she set a loaded breakfast plate before me. "He's been gone for a little while now. He'll be back soon, I'm sure."

We began to eat in silence, the clinking of silverware against plates the only sound in the room.

After a few moments, I decided to break the silence by mentioning my adventure from the previous night. "You know," I began tentatively, "last night, I thought I saw something strange in the hallway when I went to the bathroom. Funny how your mind can play tricks on you."

Eleanor and Victor exchanged a quick, almost imperceptible glance, and for a moment, there was an uncomfortable silence. Then Eleanor forced a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. “Perhaps this place is haunted after all."

I didn’t press any further. After all, I was a guest in her home, and I didn't want to overstep. I simply nodded and chuckled politely, “Perhaps it is.”

The sound of a door slamming followed by footsteps permeated the room. I turned my head toward the kitchen entrance, and there was Michael, looking as though he hadn't a care in the world.

"Good morning, everyone!" He greeted, his eyes lighting up when he saw me. He leaned down to give me a quick kiss on the cheek before taking a seat at the table.

"Good morning, Michael," Eleanor replied warmly, her earlier unease seemingly forgotten.

Victor, too, seemed to brighten up at Michael's return, offering a nod of acknowledgment.

“When I was out, I saw a few posters for the fair,” Michael poured himself a glass of orange juice, “It’s only in town this weekend. Maybe we could check it out today?”

"That sounds like a fun idea," I replied with a smile, trying my best to match Michael's enthusiasm. I was feeling much better today, and the prospect of going to a fair sounded like a great way to spend quality time with Victor and Eleanor.

The anticipation lifted my spirits, and after we cleaned up breakfast, the four of us headed back to our bedrooms to get ready for the day. I had just finished getting dressed when a sudden wave of nausea washed over me. I staggered slightly, catching the edge of the dresser for support.

"Are you alright?" Michael asked, his voice filled with concern as he rushed to my side.

I took a deep breath, trying to quell the nausea. "I think I just need a moment. Maybe I ate too quickly."

Michael’s eyebrows knitted together, and he guided me to sit on the bed. “Let me to grab you a Gravol from the bathroom or something.”

After he left the room, I could hear him talking to Eleanor and Victor out in the hallway. Their voices were muffled as they discussed something in hushed tones.

Michael returned with a glass of water and a Gravol tablet, which I took gratefully. Eleanor and Victor came to the door a moment after, concern etched on their faces.Eleanor spoke first, her tone gentle, "Samantha, are you sure you're feeling up to going to the fair? We don't want you to force yourself if you're not well."

"I’m okay.” I assured them with a weak smile. "I think I must have caught some kind of bug on the way here. You know how dirty airports can be. But I don't want you all to miss out because of me."

Eleanor exchanged a glance with Victor, and after a brief, silent conversation conveyed through their eyes, she smiled warmly at me. "That's very kind of you, Samantha… If you're sure you'll be alright here, then we'll go and enjoy the fair. But please, don't hesitate to call if you need anything."

I assured them I would, though I wondered how I could possibly call without cell service, and with that, they headed out to have a day of fun, leaving me alone in the mansion.

Convinced that the Gravol would kick in and with nothing else to do, I decided to explore a bit. I thought it might be a good opportunity to familiarize myself with the layout. I began to wander through the grand corridors and spacious rooms, my footsteps echoing in the quiet emptiness.

Eventually, almost by accident, I found myself standing in front of the library's imposing double doors once again. By now my steps had grown a bit unsteady, and I found myself pausing frequently, clutching my abdomen. The Gravol I’d taken had done nothing – in fact, I was feeling worse and wanted nothing more than to curl up in bed, but the maze-like nature of the hallways and the increasing fog in my mind had made it impossible to retrace my steps, so I simply continued forward.

When I pushed into the library, the memory of the strange wood paneling resurfaced in my mind. I approached the back of the room, and the paneling seemed even more out of place than before. I could hear Michael’s voice in my mind telling me to leave it alone, telling me he had no idea what I was talking about, but I couldn't resist the urge to investigate it. At first it seemed like it may have simply been a misguided repair to a flaw in the woodwork, but the seam running along its edges appeared too deliberate.

With curious fingers, I pressed against the seam, searching for any sign of an explanation. I gasped when the wood yielded slightly, and I realized that there was indeed something more to this than met the eye. It was now unmistakable that Michael had been aware of this secret… why had he been so adamant to keep it from me?

The paneling swung open to unveiling a concealed compartment within the library wall. Before me lay a carefully arranged array of skeleton keys, suspended neatly from hooks. Roman numerals etched beside each key hinted at their intended purpose, designating the doors they were meant to unlock.

Suddenly, the illness that had been steadily worsening surged, making my legs wobble beneath me. Desperately, I reached out and gripped the wall for support, my forehead now glistening with beads of sweat. Simultaneously, the unmistakable sound of approaching footsteps echoed in my ears, sending panic coursing through my veins - I was acutely aware that I had stumbled upon something I was not meant to see.

With unsteady hands, I shut the concealed panel and snatched a book from a nearby shelf. I forced myself to appear deeply engrossed in its pages, hoping to deflect any potential suspicion that might arise.

"Ah, there you are," a voice broke through my anxiety, and I looked up to see Michael standing there, a warm smile on his face. "We were wondering where you were. I see you've found your way to the library. Good choice."

I returned the smile, my heart still pounding in my chest. "Yes, I thought I'd do a bit of reading while you all enjoyed the fair… how long have you been gone? I think I’ve lost track of time.” I wiped away the sweat pooling on my upper lip.

Michael nodded, seemingly content with my explanation. “Three or four hours.” He extended a hand, and when I took it, his eyes widened. “You’re burning up.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Maybe I should go back to the bedroom and rest.”

Michael's grip tightened slightly. "That's a good idea. Let's get you back to the room. You need to cool down."

Michael led me through the corridors while I tried to make sense of everything that had been going on, but I could tell my unease hadn't gone unnoticed, and Michael’s protective grip on my hand seemed to tighten with every step we took.

We were about halfway back to the bedroom when I doubled over in pain, my stomach clenching suddenly, causing me to gasp.

Michael's concern deepened, and he immediately stopped, supporting me as I struggled to regain my composure. "Are you okay?”

I couldn’t reply. A heavy, oppressive silence seemed to hang in the air, making me acutely aware of my own shallow breaths.

As Michael continued to support me, a strange sense of déjà vu washed over me. I knew this room; I had been here before – I recognized it by the distinctive potted plant sitting in the corner. But it couldn't be possible. The doors had all been locked when I had last checked, and now one of them was open.

My mind raced with possibilities. It was clear that Michael, Eleanor, or Victor must have had the key to this room, but why had they kept it locked, and why was it open now? Perhaps it was an office, or a room where they kept valuables. That was a reasonable explanation.

I took a quick peek inside and noticed that the room was enveloped in darkness, its antique furniture hidden beneath dusty, draped sheets. On the far wall, I discerned what seemed to be posters or portraits, but my fleeting glimpse allowed me to make out only one—a woman's face that stirred a strange sense of familiarity, yet also an eerie unease.

This certainly wasn’t an office. In fact, the room looked as though it hadn’t been touched in years…until now.

Michael's tone turned firm as he urged me to continue towards the bedroom. "Come on. You can rest in bed." His words held an undeniable insistence that worried me, but at this point I was feeling truly terrible, so I allowed him to guide me back to the room.

I settled into mattress, the softness of the sheets offering some comfort amidst all the strange occurrences as Michael went to get me a fresh glass of water.

My mind wandered back to the woman's face. Her poster hadn’t been framed, in fact it seemed somewhat haphazardly fixed to the wall. And there was something hauntingly familiar about her, something I should know, but the fever had taken hold of me again, making my thoughts swim in a foggy sea.

With Michael's return, a fresh glass of water in his hand, my sense of confusion only deepened. I accepted the glass without much thought, raising it to my lips to take a sip. But with each passing moment, I couldn't help but question the bizarre string of events that had led me to this point. Why was I the only one who had fallen ill?

If this were something I had picked up at the airport, as I had initially suspected, then Michael should be feeling ill too. And if it were food poisoning from the mansion, wouldn't everyone here be suffering similar symptoms?

Needless to say, I only pretended to sip water from the glass.

"It's strange," I mumbled after setting the cup down, "that I'm the only one who's feeling like this. Maybe I should see a doctor or something."

Michael settled onto the edge of the bed, his gaze unwaveringly locked onto mine. "It's just exhaustion, you just need some rest," he reassured me.

As Michael's words flowed with an outward calmness, they carried a weight that hung in the air like smoldering embers from a fire, casting an eerie and disquieting glow over our conversation.

The initial spark of suspicion had ignited when he denied seeing the irregular wall panel, a detail that had etched itself into my consciousness, impossible to ignore. Then Michael's nonchalant handling of Eleanor and Victor's peculiar line of questioning during breakfast had only stoked the flames, and now? Now he insisted I was merely exhausted despite the feverish chills wracking my body and the persistent ache in my stomach, as if he were pouring fuel onto the fire.

But why? What was he hiding? The questions swirled endlessly in my mind.

And I hadn’t considered it before, but why in a mansion of this size were Michael and I staying in Eleanor’s childhood bedroom? I knew for a fact, after wandering the place, there were numerous other guest bedrooms. I suppose, in and of itself, this wasn’t too unusual. Maybe it was just Eleanor's way of making us feel welcome, a sentimental gesture. But the more I thought about it, the stranger it seemed.

The pieces of this perplexing puzzle were scattered, and I struggled to fit them together as my eyelids grew heavy. Before long, I succumbed to the fever's embrace, drifting into a fitful sleep filled with disjointed dreams of locked doors and shadowy figures.
