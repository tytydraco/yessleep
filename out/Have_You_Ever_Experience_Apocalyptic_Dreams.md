I have been living for 32 years and have a stable and satisfying job, reside in a pleasant neighborhood, and have wonderful friends and family. But an unusual event disrupted my life lately: some people in my life began disappearing one by one—colleagues, friends, family, and neighbors.

It started with a missing person case I noticed on the news, involving a stranger, so I didn't pay much attention to it. But when my boss, Mr. Parker, also disappeared, it concerned me.

As more people I knew went missing, an intense unease enveloped me.

One after another, they disappeared.

These were my friends and coworkers, and the authorities seemed incapable of providing any assistance. Frustrated by the lack of progress, I decided to visit the families of my missing colleagues and inquire about the situation.

When I approached the families of my missing colleagues, they too were clueless about how or why it had happened.

“Oh, I don’t know, Winnie my dear. Andrea was just...,” Andrea’s mother paused and sighed before completing her sentence, “vanished. It was as if she had vanished into thin air!”

“Pardon me Ma’am, but, uh...,” I paused, a bit hesitant to ask what she was about to ask because it might hurt Andrea’s mother’s feelings.

“Is there any chance that she... Uh, is there any chance Andrea ran away?”

“No, of course not. There’s no chance,” she replied. “You know, she worked out of town, living in her own apartment. From time to time she came home. Here. The morning Andrea was missing, she had arrived home just the night before. It happened just a few hours after she came home. If she planned to run away, why would she come home first at night, and then run away in the morning? That doesn’t make sense.”

That was a good point, I thought.

“Then, maybe she was... Kidnapped?” I asked again.

“That’s just impossible,” Andrea’s mother exclaimed, sounding so certain. “Andrea is a 36-year-old woman. She’s not married, doesn’t have kids, and she works on a regular job that pays her barely enough money to survive. I have to mention that she is also an antisocial person. I doubt that she even has many friends. I, as her mother, am no different. I don’t have much money in my account, or any close friends. Can you at least mention one reason why anyone would kidnap someone like that?”

That was also a good point.

“How about her belongings? Is everything here?”

“As far as I’m concerned, yeah,” Andrea’s Mother replied. For a while after her replies, she paused, staring blankly, looking perplexed.

“But it’s weird, though,” she spoke again, “not just that all her belongings are still here, even the pajamas she wore to sleep that night were laid out on her bed, in the spot where she slept. Yet Andrea was nowhere to be found.”

“I visited her bedroom the night before, a few hours after she went to sleep. Just to check on her,” Andrea’s mother started explaining herself. “She was there, lying on her bed, sleeping peacefully, wearing her pink polka dots pajamas. When I checked on her again the next morning because she hadn’t woken up yet at 8 AM, which is unusual for her, she was no longer there. But her pajamas were still there, lying on her bed, unfolded. Even stranger, each of the top and bottom parts of of pajamas were positioned on the bed, as if she had been sleeping while wearing it, but then she suddenly vanished into thin air. All the while, still on her bed.”

And Andrea wasn’t the only one.

I had visited at least ten of my friends and colleagues who disappeared in the same strange manner. I interviewed all their willing family members, proposing exactly the same scenarios, asking exactly the same questions.

They all provided me with similar stories.

One of my other missing colleagues even has a stranger scenario surrounding his disappearance.

Denzel, one of my friends from college, disappeared when he was having a barbecue party with his family.

“I had just looked away from him for a few seconds, to pick up a plate of food for him to grill,” Sophia, Denzel’s wife explained. “When I turned my head back to Denzel, he was no longer there. But his clothes, his shirt and trousers were piled on the ground, right on the spot where Denzel should have been standing, next to the grilling machine.”

It almost seemed like Denzel was standing there, wearing the shirt and trousers, and all of a sudden, he vanished into thin air, leaving his clothing behind on the ground.

It was the most peculiar incident I had ever heard in my entire life.

Upon further investigation, I found out that all the family members of my missing colleagues described a common occurrence in the lives of their loved ones. They had been experiencing recurring, identical apocalyptic dreams in the weeks leading up to their disappearances.

“In his dreams, he envisioned himself leaving his home and strolling through his familiar city, only to find it in ruins and covered in dust,” Sophia started retelling the story that her husband had shared with her.

“All the buildings he saw along his way to a place he doesn’t even recognize,” Sophia continued the story, “stood in the middle of a desert landscape devoid of trees and grass. I don’t know if you can imagine it, it looks like a post-apocalyptic depiction of life”.

“My husband then entered an unfamiliar building, and as if he had done it countless times before, he just sat in one of the chairs in what appeared to be a waiting room.”

“Sitting alongside him in the same waiting room were hundreds of other people, patiently waiting for their names to be called. When his name was called, he would walk towards a room, and open its door. As he entered the room, he said he was greeted by a blinding white light before suddenly waking up,” Sophia concluded her story told by her husband to her.

These strange, recurring apocalyptic dreams occurred daily. And the exact same dreams happened to all of my missing friends and colleagues, as relayed by their families.

A few weeks later, however, something happened.

I myself began experiencing the exact same apocalyptic dream as my missing friends and colleagues. It was exactly what Sophia, Denzel’s wife had described to be experienced by her husband.

Every single detail. All the same.

Night after night.

I started to wonder if I, too, might disappear at some point in the future.

But what would cause it? What triggered the dreams and eventually led to the disappearance?

I decided to seek guidance from someone who could help.

But who?

It took me a while, but a psychiatrist seemed like the most suitable person to approach, considering it was a dream-related issue.

I disclosed everything I had regarding the event that happened to my colleagues to Dr. Randall, the psychiatrist. I also told him about the recurring dreams I recently had experienced every night for the past two weeks.

To my surprise, Dr. Randall appeared taken aback, as if he had some prior knowledge of the matter. Dr. Randall asked me to wait in the room while he went out to discuss the issue with his superior.

Upon returning to his office about half an hour later, Dr. Randall shared something with me.

"This information was not meant to be disclosed to the public due to regulations. However, given the recent events affecting many people, as you have observed, we have decided to inform anyone who asks," he said.

Dr. Randall hesitated for a moment before starting his explanation.

"You mentioned the strange recurring dreams that you and your missing colleagues have experienced. Well, the truth is... those were not dreams."

I was taken aback and utterly puzzled.

"What do you mean they weren't dreams?"

"The world you believe you live in—where you go to work, spend time with friends and family, and even this moment right now, talking to me—that is the dream," Dr. Randall clarified, leaving me even more bewildered.

It made no sense.

"To be precise, it is an artificially constructed reality known as a dreamscape," Dr. Randall added.

"The Earth as we know it is broken, ruined, and abandoned. It resulted from a global nuclear catastrophe that occurred eight years ago. The world that you saw in what you thought to be your 'dream' is the actual current state of our planet."

"The governments of the world took responsibility for these events. The conditions on Earth were no longer sustainable for human work or daily life. Our only option was to wait for the Earth's inevitable decay, which is horrific in itself. To address this, the governments developed the Dream Capsule Project," Dr. Randall continued his explanation.

"The capsules were highly complex systems equipped with food supplies and connected to a dream engine. Due to their intricate nature, they could not be placed in your homes. Moreover, the capsules require trained technicians to reboot them every 24 hours for your safety."

"In technical terms, each morning, you wake up, make your way to the facility, enter the capsules, and fall asleep for the remainder of your day. The capsules are interconnected via a dream connector, creating a seamless environment for you to exist within the dream. That's how you can still interact with the people you know, including myself."

"However, even though you visit the facility every morning and return home each night, the system prevents you from recalling the world beyond this artificial reality—the real world. Once you enter the capsule and fall asleep, you are essentially living here."

"But... we did remember the real world. In our dreams. If what you're saying is true," I questioned the psychiatrist, my voice trembling. "And how does all of this connect to the disappearances of my colleagues?"

"It's true, believe me. We're about to delve into that," Dr. Randall assured.

"You see, machines also have a limited lifespan. Your television, radio, phone—they all eventually wear out. The same goes for these capsules. The deteriorating state of the Earth accelerated the decay of the capsules beyond our initial estimations. Meanwhile, the world's government faced severe financial and resource constraints, making it impossible to repair all the errors that arose."

"So, that's the reason. Your ability to recall your journey from home to the facility was simply a glitch in your capsule. It was deteriorating and on the verge of shutting down. There was nothing we could do about it," Dr. Randall concluded his explanation.

"W-wait... What would happen to me if my capsule shuts down?" I inquired, a mix of disbelief and horror coursing through.

While I still harbored doubts about Dr. Randall's claims, the potential implications filled me with dread.

"You will die. You'll no longer be part of the system. From the perspective of your colleagues, friends, and family, you will simply 'go missing,' like the others," Dr. Randall replied.

"At least you'll meet your end in a state of bliss. In a perfect, beautiful world, rather than the ruined one," he added, offering a friendly smile. A smile that I found discomforting.

"Don't worry, eventually, this fate awaits all of us. Including me. Including the president. Every single person," Dr. Randall attempted to console me, although his words didn’t even lessen the horror I had felt.

"What... What should I do now?" I asked, stuttered.

“Nothing,” Dr. Randall replied.

“Live your life as usual. When your capsule fails, and in this state, let’s expect it to be about a month, you’ll simply pass away in peace.”

‘In peace’ he said.

Well, so I have about one month left to live.

How about you?

Have you ever experienced apocalyptic dreams?
