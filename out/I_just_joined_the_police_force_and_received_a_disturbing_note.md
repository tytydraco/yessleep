I’m not sure how to start this post. For context, my 32m name is Thomas Blakely, and I moved to a rural town called Tarrahue about two weeks ago to begin working as an officer. Back where I’m from, there was a surplus of candidates for the relatively small city, so the call was given for surplus officers to take up positions in places around the state. Being a 32 year old with no other options or real experience in any other field, I didn’t really have a choice but to accept. I moved here with my 34f long-time girlfriend, Avery, and at first it seemed great, ideal, even. Tarrahue has that small-town feel, you know? The kinda one that feels like a simpler time, where everyone knows everyone else’s names. So when we got here, I was in high spirits! That is until, I came in to work for the first day to see an empty station, with a crumpled old note on the floor. I picked it up and started to read it, and it goes as follows.

Hey kid, congratulations on making it this far. You’ve just become an officer of the Tarrahue county police force. The name’s Deputy Blackwood and I will be in charge of your orientation. We’re a small town, but don’t let that fool you. Tarrahue can be a beast that’ll chew up and spit up kids like you if you ain’t careful. To get started I will run you through some basic, but essential, rules for the job.

Rule 1:

Keep a gun handy. Unfortunately, Tarrahue county ain’t supplied with firearms for every officer. Officially, we aren’t really supposed to use em’ outside of emergency cases, but ain’t no one gonna enforce that rule here, ‘specially not the chief. I recommend a small handgun, get’s the job done good enough. It’s essential to have one on you when engaging in active combat, as protecting the civilians comes before all else. And, should it come to it, to spare you the pain.

Rule 2:

Never follow the scream. Yes, ’the’ scream and not ‘a‘ scream. We say it here because you’ll know the difference when you hear it. We ain’t got no clue what it is or what it comes from, but it sure as hell ain’t human, at least anymore. Think of the scream like the lure of an anglerfish. Any officer I’ve seen gone to check it out ain’t been seen since. I mean, all except the chief that is.

Rule 3:

We all ignore the painting in the break room. If you value your life you’ll do the same. It was normal, at least at first. Brought in by Officer Thompson’s wife after he passed. Said his grandma made it home as a tribute, and that he’d want it to be here. Seemed pretty average at first. It showed Thompson from the waist up, clutchin’ white lillies. But it… changed. Whatever‘s holdin’ them flowers now, it ain’t him.

Rule 4;

always offer help to nightime visitors. we get them a lot here, and it’s almost always because they are in danger. they can be shy though, so invite them inside the station.

Rule 5:

Never use the stairs. We don’t have a second floor. I’ve seen countless good men go up, and when they come back, they come back in pieces. If you wanna claim the body of a friend who took a trip up the stairway, you can find em’ behind the building. I think that’s where the thing dumps it’s leftovers.

Rule 6:

If you meet anyone that calls themselves a member of the Grenville family, run. The entire family died of a gas leak in 2008, and what they left behind sure ain‘t friendly. If you do talk to one, and they invite you to dinner, it’s too late. You’ve been marked, and it’s a helluva lot better to end things on your own terms on the spot.

Rule 7:

Tip the janitors. Nobody got a clue who hired em’ but they sure as hell do good work. But they ain’t exactly what you’d call human, and if you don’t give em’ that tip you’ll face the consequences.

Rule 8:

The woods are not your friend. Nothing in Tarrahue is really, but there’s something in those trees that wants to see you suffer far more than the creatures that prowl the streets. Under no situation are you ever to enter them.

Rule 9:

If you see a shadowy figure in the corner of your eye, the best way to trick it is to stand perfectly still. After a few minutes it should move in to new prey.

Rule 10:

If you see a civilian sitting alone on the bench outside, ask em’ for their name. Be very careful, take note of how they tell you. Some things here can mess with your mind. Watch their mouthes. If they don’t move or open as they speak, tell them you have to respond to an urgent call and quickly get away.

Rule 11;

the broom close it what you’d call a ‘safe zone’. if in any danger, head directly there and tell nobody.

Rule 12:

At night, leave the door open. The strangers will be looking for places that are trying to hide. If they believe you’ve been harvested already they ain’t gonna bother you further. Same goes for the police station if you’re on night duty.

Rule 13:

Never enter the chief’s office without permission. It don’t take kindly to uninvited guests.

I s’pose that covers it for now. I‘ll be in to the station in the next couple of days or so to help you get your head ’round the job. In the meantime, I’m aware you’ve been assigned your daily beat check. Stick to the rules and you’ll be fine. Pleasure to have you aboard rookie.

PS. Before I go, I’ve noticed some rules have been altered. Ignore any rule startin’ with a semi colon or without capitals.

I… don’t know what to think about it. I’ll post an update soon.
