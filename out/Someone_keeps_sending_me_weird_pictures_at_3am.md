I know what you’re thinking. I should have done it sooner. Maybe you’re right, I’m an absolute twat for waiting, hesitating, for letting my mind get tangled in all these possibilities instead of just calling the police and opening my mouth. But I did it, I went to the police. 

For those of you not in the know, I’ll link my first post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwb4su/someone_keeps_sending_me_weird_pictures_at_3am/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

I told them everything. About the photos, the room, the… stranger. I left out the reddit part because they would probably put me on a register. Just said that I’d received anonymous messages, and one night, the photos started. That I feel like someone wanted me to see this, to know about it. I told them how I’d spent time trying to figure it out myself, how long I’d looked at those photos for clues. At the end of the day though, I’m not a detective, I didn’t have the know-how.

The enquiry officer at the desk signposted me to a Police Constable – who was serious but not unfriendly, to be perfectly honest he looked bored as he tapped at his keyboard, nodding along like he had heard it all before. I told him about the pictures. About the room, the blood, the bindings.

“Are you sure that this isn’t someone pissing you around? He asked me.
“People do this type of stuff all the time.”

I told them no. I know what real fear looked like. That I could feel it in my gut.

They told me that they would look into it. They’d trace the number and see if there were any missing persons or crimes in the area that matched what I described. They took my phone, said they’d “analyse the metadata” from the pictures. I walked out of the station feeling – what? Relieved? Not quite. Like I’d handed off a burden that wasn’t really mine to carry in the first place.

I haven’t heard from them yet. No updates. I haven’t really been on my phone since – I feel like it belongs to them now, even though they gave it back. Like they’rewatching me through it, waiting for me to slip up and say something wrong. I know that’s paranoia talking, but that feeling doesn’t shake so easily.

I woke up today feeling…. Normal. About as normal I can get, the kind of morning where the world resets itself a little bit. My bed was warm, the air outside grey and calm. I climbed out, stretched, let the bones in my back click themselves into place. I padded down the stairs, still in my t-shirt and boxers, rubbing at my face like I could scrub the leftover thoughts out of my skull.

Mum was in the lounge, the glow of the TV flickering against her face. Supermarket Sweep, again. She loves her reruns, laughing at the same old jokes, reacting to it like it was brand new. The smell of tea in her untouched mug curled through the air.

Dad was in the garden, the back door was wide open (again), letting in the chill of the fresh morning air. He was crouched by the flower beds, turning soil with his hands and planting small bulbs.

I made myself breakfast. Toast, coffee. Sat at the table, listening to the faint sound of my dad working outside and the occasional chuckle of the lounge. The house was quiet this morning, in a way that homes get when they have settled into themselves. A three-bedroom detached house - nothing too special. Brown brick, front garden that looked tidy from a distance but a little neglected the closer you got to it. The kind of place where families grow up and move on. Except we never really moved on after my brother joined the army.

I finished eating, rinsed my plate in the sink and got dressed for work – the usual uniform-nothing that could get caught in machinery. The walk to the abattoir wasn’t long, but it always felt further than it was. The air smelled like wet concrete and metal the closer you got to the gates.

Bryant was already there, leaning against the chain link fence, smoking a cigarette like he was trying to finish it before it burned him. He is a tall, thin and pale specimen, always slouching like he is bracing for impact. He looked up as I approached, his mouth already halfway forming a question.

“Jesus, mate. You look like shit!”

Business as usual.

 - -

The abattoir was a contradiction, Cold and sterile, but always humming with the quiet violence of its purpose. The floors are always spotless, a true testament to industrial-strength cleaners and the efficiency of men and women in plastic aprons and chainmail gloves.

I work the killing line. Not the bolt gun – no, that was for the senior workers. I handled the shackles. Hooked the stunned bodies by their hind legs and sent them up, one after another, a steady, inevitable chain of rhythm and pigs. The air is always thick with an irony smell and something deeper, more primal. A smell that clung to me no matter how many showers I took.

After a few hours of sending pigs to meet their maker, I went for my lunch. Bryant was waiting for me in the break room. His uniform is ridiculously ill fitting, hanging incredibly loose on his pale skin in the flickering fluorescent lights. He looked at me the same way he always does lately – like I was an animal he wasn’t sure was safe to approach.

“Any news?” he asked, voice too casual.

I shook my head. “Nothing yet”

Bryant frowned. “So, they just downloaded your phone and sent you home?”

“They said they’d follow up.”

“And you believe them?” He smirked.

I didn’t answer. Because what was there to say? The police didn’t care. Not really. Not about some grainy images sent to a nobody from an untraceable number.

Bryant exhaled through his nose, a frustrated little sound as he played around with the vending machine.

“It’s fucked up, man. I mean… You saw that guy. You saw his face!”

I did. Swollen, bloody, mouth half open in a scream that wasn’t allowed to leave his throat.

“He looked… familiar” Bryant added, almost hesitant.

My body stiffened. “What do you mean?”

Bryant shifted uncomfortably as he sat down.
“I don’t know. Maybe it’s just… seeing someone like that, you start imagining things. Making connections that aren’t there.”

A sharp silence settled between us for the rest of our break time.

I stood, ready to get back to work.

“My break’s over.”

After work I decided that I’d take the scenic route home, besides, the fresh air would do me some good after spending all day worrying. I walked past streets that felt too quiet. The sky had the heavy grey of a day that never quite woke up, the air damp from the earlier rain. 
I thought about what Bryant said earlier, I thought about my brother. About the day he left, duffel bag slung over his shoulder, boots polished to a dull shine. He’d decided he was going to join the army a few years ago – Royal Anglian Regiment. Said he wanted structure, purpose. Something more than this town, this family.

I haven’t seen him in years. Not really. Calls eventually got shorter. Texts and letters stopped. He’d slipped away, much to the behest of my mum, piece by piece, until he was just a name, just an idea of someone who used to be close.

My phone vibrated.

My body went completely cold, as if my blood had turned to ice. I hesitated before pulling it from my pocket.

18:26pm

A new number.

A new picture.

I can’t move, not because I’m scared but because the image demands stillness, like I’m a deer caught in headlights. This was a completely different picture. No bound beaten man, no fresh horror laid bare. Instead, something quieter – something worse.

It was a hallway, long and narrow, suffocated by deep shadows that the weak, yellow light overhead can’t seem to reach.

The walls were covered in old wallpaper, a faded floral pattern that might have once been white, but had been rotted into a sickly, nicotine-stained yellow. The edges curl away from the plaster, revealing dark gaps, as if the walls are trying to peel away their own skin.

The floorboards, warped with age, look damp, as if something had soaked into the hard wood over years, staining it in uneven black streaks. The kind of house where the air never quite moves, where the dust settles and stays, thick and undisturbed. Stale.

Then my eyes catch on something.

A door. Slightly ajar.

A sliver of darkness splits the frame, just wide enough to see something – someone – peering through.

At first, it’s nothing but a vague shape in the gloom. A shadow against a deeper shadow. But I can see something more, my stomach drops with a sickening lurch, like an elevator cable fraying one strand at a time.

A grin.

A wide, unnatural grin, stretched too far across a face that remains mostly hidden in the crack. The lips are dry and cracked, curling upwards into a grotesque mimicry of human expression. Too many teeth – too white – catch the dim light in jagged, uneven rows, like something carved from bone rather than grown.

It digs into my brain like a rusted hook, catching somewhere deep in my matter. A pressure in my chest builds, like a great hand with fingers splayed across my ribs, testing and squeezing for cracks.

The longer I look, the more wrong it seems. The corners of the mouth strain, struggling to contain the pearly white teeth, as if something behind the face is pulling at the skin, forcing it to smile, a smile that isn’t meant to be there.

Everything feels wrong now. Not just in the way a stranger looking through your window feels wrong, but deeper – like an error in the fabric of reality itself. Like the world has glitched, and I’m the only one who sees it.

Another message.

“I CAN SEE YOU.”

I don’t know if this is a statement or a threat.

- -

The walk home is different this time. I don’t hear footsteps – I feel them. The way they echo a half step too late, like there is another pair just out of sync with mine. The streetlights hum overhead, their glow too sharp, too sterile. Every window and house I pass feels like a watching eye.

I keep my hands stuffed in my pockets; my breath is shallow. My skin prickles with something I can’t shake, something crawling out from beneath the surface. I don’t dare turn around, but I know – I know – if I do something will be standing just far enough away to make me doubt if I ever saw it.

By the time I step up to my front door, my chest is tight, lungs burning from the pace I had just walked. My hands trembledas I fished for my keys, shoving them into the lock with more force than I needed, feeling as though I was going to explode through the door.

Inside, everything is… Normal.

Mum is still in the lounge, curled in her chair watching supermarket sweep. She lets out a little chuckle at something that I couldn’t quite make out, her hand folded neatly in her lap, cup of tea at her side.

Dad is outside in the garden. I catch a glimpse of him through the window as I pass by – hunched over something in the shed, his shoulders moving like he’s focussed on some unseen tasks. The door slightly ajar, spilling a thin sliver of light onto the grass. He doesn’t look up. 

No messages.
No pictures.
No grinning faces in the dark.
I let out a breath I hadn’t realised I was holding. 

The routine helps. Brushing my teeth, undressing, settling into bed. The familiarity of it dulls the jagged edge of unease. My phone remains silent, untouched on my bedside table.

For the first time in days, I feel like maybe – maybe – this is over. 

I wake to the soft, unnatural glow of my phone screen in the darkness

03:00am

A new message.

A video.

An unknown number.
