“Think this retreat is going to help?” Johan asked, his eyes glued to his Zodiac book.



“I hope so. God knows I need this to work.” I whispered back.



We were at the Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve, a remote part of Sweden where many come to find peace and a reconnection with nature. Our retreat of thirteen people was here for a similar reason. With each step we took, we hoped to part away with some piece of our stress. We hoped the lush green grass, cool crystal rivers, and the sight of these mesmerizing mountains would help give our souls some peace we all so dearly deserved.



You see, all thirteen people in our retreat were so stressed out from the lives we had, that we had no option but to momentarily abandon it. For me, I was escaping my dying sister. Her loving eyes had always seen me with trust, but how do I tell her that I am failing to get the money she needs for her treatment. When I was fired she told me it would be alright, that I will find another job easily. But how do I tell her that I have seen nothing but rejection? I have dried up all my savings and now have no more left to fund her recovery. So here I am… escaping.



“It’s getting dark, we should camp here now.” Anna said in her usual irritated tone. 

“Oh look at Anna, she is tired already so now she wants us all to stop.” Maja remarked and rubbed her forehead.



Anna and Maja were sisters, Johan told me. Their sources of stress were, well, each other. I don’t know what made them hate each other, but at least they were here trying to make amends and improve their relationship. It wasn’t really going well though.



“Try to ignore them, they are both Aries. I wouldn’t want to talk to them at this time of the year.” Johan warned me. He had an unhealthy obsession with astrology. Zodiac signs decided whom he talked to and whom he ignored. Whom he loved and whom he hated. But I never judged him for that.



“Just take a vote.” Anna sighed. We all took a vote, and the majority seemed to favor stopping for the day and setting up the camp.



Johan and I decided to share our tent. We set it up mostly in silence. He brushed aside all my attempts to find out why he was here. Perhaps his pain was too private to share.



After setting up our tent we joined the others around the campfire. When I say campfire I mean a small lantern around whose dimly glow we all sat down. We all discussed our lives. Some in our group told us that they were feeling better, even healing. Others in our group, like me, were still waiting for relief.



“Alright well that’s enough chatter for today. I am going.” Anna said and stood up, about to leave. That’s when we heard a thunderous slam a few feet from us. We all instantly turned our faces to see what happened. What I saw sent a shiver down my spine.



A few feet from us lay a bleeding cat which was skinned entirely. I and a few others got up to get a closer look and inspected that the cat had some sort of weird symbols carved on its bare skin.



“What the fuck?” I whispered.



And then we heard a second boom. And then the third. We looked down to see another skinned cat and a dog laying a few feet from us. They had similar symbols carved on them.



“Where the hell did they come from?” an older man asked while clutching his head in his palms.



I stood still for a moment, and then slowly looked up. And I saw it. Dogs and cats falling down from the night sky lit by nothing but stars. In a flash, our campsite was filled with dead dogs and cats that rained down with force. All of us started to run and dodge the animals coming from above, screaming and crying.



And then it stopped.



We all waited for a few moments in silence half expecting the deadly rain to start pouring again but it never did. We all looked at each other trying to conjure up any sort of explanation for what just happened.



And then he came. His tall and slender body seemed to blur the space around him. He walked slowly to the middle of our camp, dogs and cats levitating and parting to make way for him. He stood in the middle and stayed still while we all could do nothing but freeze in the fear we all felt. Then he turned his face, or what I think was his face, to me- lifted his hand and pointed his finger directly at me. 



And I laughed. My sister was alone and dying and here I was… running away. I laughed at the absurdity of it all. And soon the rest of the group joined in, our laughter echoing against the giant mountains.



The man then faced Anna and Maja, who slowly moved closer to him. When they were close to him, they stopped, turned, and hugged each other. As soon as they parted their hug, the man grabbed their hair and lifted them up with ease. He turned and left, taking the sisters with him.



When he left, leaving us all surrounded by the maimed bodies of these animals, we felt we could do nothing but retire to sleep. So we did. I tried to find Johan, but he was nowhere to be seen. So I went to bed without him. I remember checking my watch to see what time it was, but the hands were moving the wrong way, and I was too tired to care.



The next morning we all woke up with an inexplicable calm. We all were… happy. With the purpose of our retreat fulfilled, we all decided to head back to the world we came from. The busy cities welcomed us back. We told the police that Anna and Maja were lost. A few search operations were organized, but of course they led to nothing.



That thing or man, whatever it was, took away my guilt- my grief. I no longer feel responsible for the care of my sister.



For that, I am grateful.
