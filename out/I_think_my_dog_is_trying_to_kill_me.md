My husband always wanted a dog. I am by no means a dog lover, but after years of prodding, I finally caved. We were both so excited—we took off from work and went to the local shelter to see which one to adopt. After a couple of visits, we finally settled on one. She was a small thing, barely a couple of pounds, and her previous owners had recently passed away. I was happy, but my husband was ecstatic.

The first couple of months were difficult, of course, as any new dog owner would know. It took a while to create a routine for Coconut (that’s what we named her after hours of debate) and for ourselves. But I had to admit, having a dog brought us so much joy we couldn’t remember what our lives looked like before. It wasn’t until we had Coconut for a few months that something strange happened.

A few days ago, while my husband was at work, I called out to Coconut to come eat her lunch. Normally she appears after a couple seconds to eat, but this time it had been a couple of minutes and she didn’t show up. I looked in a couple of her normal hiding places, and when I couldn’t find her, I immediately began to worry. I was seconds away from calling my husband when I saw her slowly walking towards her food bowl. I let out a sigh of relief, but when I walked towards her, something was off. She was eating her food very slowly, as if she wasn't hungry at all, which was extremely strange behavior for her. I reached down to scratch her head when I noticed something white stuck on her harness. It took a few attempts to pull it off, but after further inspection, it looked like a feather? I didn’t know what to make of it, but I thought to ask my husband later if he knew where it might have come from. My guess was that Coconut had ripped up a pillow or something, and the fluff or feather had caught on to her harness.

Telling my husband about the feather slipped my mind. It wasn’t until yesterday that I thought about it again. My husband and I were replanting our flower bed, and we were trying to clean up some weeds and dead flowers to make room for new soil. He had gotten out a shovel and was digging up the old soil to make some room when we were met with a horrible smell like something died. We were so confused, how could something have died here in our flower bed? We agreed to dig a little deeper to figure out where this smell was coming from. After a few minutes of my husband continuing to dig, he said he had hit something solid. I took a few steps back and turned around, already feeling queasy. He said he’d brush away some of the dirt, and after looking at it, he said that it looked like a dead goose. *Dead goose*? It didn’t make any sense. How could a goose be buried in our flower bed? Our backyard was fenced, and we hadn’t touched it in months. It didn’t make any s—*wait*.

I felt my entire body go cold, and without turning around, I asked my husband what color the goose was. And although he was confused by my question, he replied white. But I already knew that. 

She didn’t. But did she? There was no other logical explanation.

I ran back inside our house, my husband chasing after me. I didn’t know what else to do, but I just immediately started hyperventilating. Then, while my husband was giving me a hug, it came out. The feather I saw on Coconut, the connection with the goose—my entire far-fetched theory. And as any normal person would, he laughed in my face. He called me paranoid and said that there was no way our sweet dog could harm another animal like that. I wanted to take her to the vet, but my husband argued that it was already getting late and that we’d go in the morning. We also agreed that Coconut would stay in her crate in the living room during the night instead of in our bedroom like she normally did. I felt so incredibly unsafe in my own house, and deep down, my gut was telling me that there was something very wrong with Coconut.

At night, my husband went to put Coconut in her crate while I waited in our bedroom. I had been scrolling on social media, and it had been more than 20 minutes and he still hadn’t come back. We didn’t really ever use the crate, but normally it never took this long to get her in it. I called my husband’s name a couple of times with no answer. I was about to get up when I realized that we still had a pet camera in the living room from when we first got Coconut and would leave her alone in the house. It had been a while since we used it, but since I was feeling slightly lazy, I decided to check there first instead of going downstairs. I opened the app, and I was sick to my stomach by what I saw. I froze and didn’t know what to do. After debating for a couple minutes, I dialed 911.

I only had the courage to go downstairs when the police arrived. They asked me what happened, and I started crying. I said that something had broken into our home and my husband had gone downstairs to investigate. When he hadn’t returned after a while, I went downstairs to find him dead. We lived in bear country, so after checking the body, they didn’t ask many follow up questions. While they finished their investigation, they advised me to check into a nearby hotel for the night and that they’d contact me in the morning. 

It's morning now, and I’m still in my hotel room watching the footage over and over. I removed the camera before the police came, because there’s no way they’d understand. It was the most disturbing scene I'd ever seen in my life: my husband lying on the ground, blood pooling around him—while Coconut tore at his neck with her teeth. That’s not even the scariest part. As soon as I started watching, you can see Coconut stop mauling my husband and slowly pan her head towards the camera as if she can see me, and she holds eye contact with the camera. But it was her eyes I still think about—bright red and piercing. A warning, or a promise to be more exact. Because even now outside the window of the hotel room, I can see red eyes following my every move.
