The tragic story of an old band called ‘Swing Arkano’.

Swing Arkano was a British post-punk and new wave band formed in Birmingham on July 24, 1978. Their performances were highly praised by their fans, and they were able to compete with some of the most well-known bands of the time. The record label and casette maker of the band, 1981, stated that their first album, titled Paradox, was composed of 8 songs, with the eighth song being unknown and only heard by a select few.

 "Why haven't you released the song?" the music distributor asked. Fortunately, the song is a true one, and the only proof of its authenticity is a 32-second clip containing the lyrics. The songs in the album of question are 1. Rude Awakening  (2:56), 2. Morning (1:45), 3. Bacon at 4:34 (3:36), 4. Easier To Say (2:30) 5. Time (2:58) and 6. Mind Your Head  (4:56) Song 7: unknown. (???)

Upon the release of their album, the band went into a state of radio silence. There were no further reports of the band's whereabouts or activities. 

Neighbours reported that the band had not been seen or heard from in a while. One neighbour expressed their concern, saying that they had not been out for a while and that they felt strange now that the area was quiet.

 After weeks of silence, there were yet more news reports about the band's inactivity, with one neighbour expressing their hope that they were not dead, as they were known to be outgoing. It is very strange that this particular news reporter  concluded by reassuring the neighbour that they would do their best to find out if the band was okay. 

A few weeks after the news report, a witness named George saw one of the members of the band sitting or standing in their bedroom. They were not moving so he had a right to be concerned, he ran to all of the neighbours' houses and told them about what he had seen. The neighbours then went to the band members' house and tried to open the door, but nothing happened. They tried again, and again, but still nothing happened.

 One of the neighbours called for the police and an ambulance. The police arrived in less than 5 minutes and rammed the door. The police then searched the entire house for the band members. They searched the living room, the kitchen, the garage, and the bathroom. As they got closer to the bedroom, they were swarmed by flies. “This doesn’t bode well for us,” said one of the officers. The main officer then opened the bedroom door and, in the officer’s own words, “it was the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen in my years of homicide investigation.”

 The band members were hanging by a rope.

One for each member, not only that but they had a symbol carved into their chest along with their hearts carved too, what made this even more sickening, the hearts were out of their body and placed under each person the hearts each had a number on them. Even more officers came in with a camera and numbers. 

The people were told to leave as they would investigate the crime scene. 

This went on for three weeks, each day passing more and more slowly as the tension mounted. One day, Swing Arkano’s distributor released some information for a final news report. The cause of death was found to be suicide.

 The carvings however are still unexplainable to this say. 

 They also had good and bad news. 

The 7th song, ‘crystal,’ was found (5:32). People had speculated that the 7th song was a suicide song. Swing Arkano was at its prime in 1979-1981. The members were John Ackerman (1961-1981), Thomas Buckley (1962-1981), Anton Mitchel (1960-1981) and Edward Theobald (1960-1981). They will be greatly missed and their music will continue to play in their honor.
