I informed yall acouple days ago about the situation I was in previously. Well I got some detrimenting news to update yall on. Here's the previous information if you haven't seen it already. https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10kyc63/ive_been_stuck_in_a_paradox_loop_for_the_past_200/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

I was busy collecting rocks to study the erosion they have built of over the years. Then I saw a weird gray area near my house, I decided to investigate to find out what it was and what was causing it. Suddenly, I got sucked into the portal and noclipped out of reality. I started to get flashbacks of what the demon did to me. I start ripping parts of the walls to hopefully get out, nothing worked. I started to faint, before my eyes closed I saw it, the one thing that almost killed me. I got a burst of adrenaline and started running as fast as I could to escape the entity, it trailed me for what seemed like miles. Gasping for breath I collapse on the cold floor, the entity making its way toward me. I felt nauseous and felt like barfing all out my organs out. Hearing it's footsteps slowly approaching, I sit there and accept my fate, then it started becoming warped. Like it was being pulled into a black hole, it started manifesting itself into a person. 

I spring up, I plead to not get mutilated by it. Didn't do anything, it just sat there contemplating what to do with my helpless ass. I think of the only thing to do, enethical or not, I take pieces of the wall apart and forge a blade, I slit my wrists and point the blade at the beast. The smell of my blood could trip out the entity and hopefully make my escape. Instead, it inched closer and closer. Until we were less than 4 feet apart. 
"Welcome back, Hunter" 
"How do you know my name?"
"You needn't know, but I can help you escape" 
I was aghast at the words it just uttered. Even knowing the risks involved, I followed it. 

We crossed multiple unusual places. Some were drowned with different beings, some hostile some not. We were doing alright until we crossed a certain location. It was destroyed with fire on each corner, armed soldiers aiming directly at us.
"Why are they aiming at us?"
"They aren't, they are specially aiming at YOU,"
"Why?"
"They are here to execute you Hunter, you were the only one to escape this place, they've been hunting you for months, they were the ones who made the portal you went through,"
I was speechless, this entire time, I was being escorted to my death place. With a last ditch effort, I sprint for my life. They were shooting at me, I got hit in the shoulder. It hurt like hell but I still had to keep going. 

I made it to a store, dashing in. Getting stuff to heal my gun shot wound, then I hear them marching in. 
"GO! GO FIND HIM AND KILL HIM,"
I grab supplies and rush for the door on the other side. I run for hours, until I found it, the portal. Right as I jump in, I hear them. 
"This is the end for you Hunter, turn around with your hands up or we will blast your motherfucking brains out," I back up, I make a running jump. Soldiers start loading me with bullets, I collapse on the ground, drowning myself in a pool of my own blood. 
"Any last words?"
I see it, the thing that brought me here, it stares at me with its plain lifeless eyes, it has a massive grin on its face and starts sprinting to the soldiers. My Consciousness was slipping fast, with little strength I had, push myself in the portal.

I escaped, but I couldn't move. The bullets were lodged in my torso and my legs. I try to take them out, I start ripping my guts out to get the bullets. It was too late, I heard the paramedics kicking the door down, but I couldn't move, I start to see a bright light. This is it, death. They get the door down and rush me to the hospital, when I was being lifted in the ambulance I was back in the same room I almost perished in, I saw death. He was looking at me.
"I just LOVE the smell of FEAR, I can smell your bloodlust!" He walks towards me with a katana in hand, I started feeling something, like something just snapped. Something inside of me. I spring up and start to fight. I grab his katana and stab his heart. He disintegrates into dust. I get back into reality.

It's all over, or is it?
