Hello, I don't quite know why I'm writing this, but it's been a story I've told my kids and recently my youngest thought I should write about it. She said it would be a good way to tell others about what happened to me, and possibly warn anyone reading this so they never end up in a situation like mine, or even worse. 

If you ever visit my hometown,but it's unlikely you ever will. Never go out past midnight. Because it might be a deadly mistake. 

Also, before we get started I'd like to apologize for any poor grammar. English isn't my first language. 

This happened a long time ago, in the summer of the mid eighties. I had just graduated from high school and I was working odd jobs while trying to find what to do with myself. One night I was able to get another job, it was at the local train station. 

It was a tiny place people usually went past while heading to another town or to visit family out of town. And it's little ticket booth was ran by a kind elderly man, named Syougi. But most of us just called him Grandfather. He worked there long before i was born,i heard he even started working there at my age. But that day he fell ill,it seemed to just be a bad summer cold if i remember correcctly. But because of his old age it weakened him quite a bit. And hed have to stay home for the next few days,usually when this happened his grandson took his place. But he was away traveling with family for summer break. So i gladly took his place when I was given the chance.

But when i talked with him over the phone to get all the rules and needed information for the job he told me something odd. “Ouka,when the last train leaves you must close up the shop right away. No matter what.” At first I dismissed those words,he must have just been letting his superstitions get to him again. I don't fully remember what I responded with but it was probably some joke like. “Of course Mr Amami, It's not like I want to stay there all day.”

But looking back on it today I should have listened to him. 

The day was absolutely boring, A few travelers here and there. The local high school students heading to the nearby high school. Our town was too small to have one unless we wanted it to be built in with the elementary school. So I mostly did random things like reading magazines, books and so on. 

By 11:40 the last train passed, and it was time for me to start closing up the booth like Mr Amami said. But I didn't. I decided instead to just do some work here and there, clean up the booth, count cash and pack my bags. It would surely only be a few minutes I thought to myself. But by the time I was finished,it was 12:25.

And then I heard footsteps. 

They were soft, slow and coming towards the booth. And then I heard a tap on the window. I turned around, lifting the curtain. 

And she was right there. A woman in a pale blue dress,it looked like it was from decades ago. And she had long matted black hair that draped over her face. And she stood perfectly still, before she still opened her mouth. A weak voice leaving her lips. 

“One ticket, please.”

I froze up, not knowing what to say,The last train had already left.

“I'm sorry.” my voice was shaking. “But the booth is closed.” she didn't respond though, but I could tell she wasn't happy at least looking back on it. Instead she continued. “Ticket please.”

Sweat ran down my neck, I leaned forward gripping the counter tightly. “You have to go back home and return in the morning. All the trains aren't here and the few passing by aren't taking passengers.”

Silence filled the air, and then she took a step closer. Leaning into the window and nearly pressing against the window. 

“Give me a ticket.’’ 

My blood went cold, it was so cold it felt like ice. And Her voice was cold and empty. I opened my mouth to speak. But I immediately knew. 

She wasn't human. 

I don't remember much after that, like most memories it's unfortunately quite fuzzy. But I continued to deny her a ticket again and again, each time she grew angrier and angrier. Until she crawled out of the window,phasing through it like it wasn't even there and she attacked me but I don't remember how. 

And then nothing else. 

And the next thing I could remember was the feeling of sunlight against my face and someone waking me up by calling my name. It was just a boy from the town, I think he was one of the high schoolers. Probably there to go to school. My knees were curled up to my chest and my fingers were do curled up into my hands they dug into the flesh, drawing a little bit of blood. 

I was shaking, I felt cold like it was in the middle of the winter, but it was one of the hottest days in summer. I was taken home and I had to lay down. When he got better Mr Amami came to visit me and ask how the job went, I stayed silent. Only telling him the average things that usually happen. But nothing about the ghost woman. But he could easily peace together what happened, shaking his head. I don't think he was angry in me but he was certainly disappointed. 

“You saw her, didn't you?”

I nodded my head, he didn't say anything and just patted my shoulder. 

I never worked there again, or even went outside past midnight. I still know nothing about her, even Mr Amami doesn't know. But listen to this warning, if you're ever in a tiny town deep in the countryside never stay past midnight. And if you hear footsteps coming toward you. Don't look up, and get away as soon as possible. Or you might just meet a fate worse than mine.
