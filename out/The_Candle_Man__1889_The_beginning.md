I shall never forget the night I first beheld him.

It was in the latter days of October, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and eighty‑nine, when the air in Blackwater had grown so chill that one’s breath hung before the mouth like smoke. The factories by the river coughed their own smoke into the sky, and it seemed to me that our town lived beneath a low, black ceiling that the sun could scarcely pierce.

I was then in service at Mrs. Kline’s boarding house on Mill Street, where the river men and foundry workers took their meals and their sleep. Each evening it fell to me to light the lamps along the passage and in the parlor, so that when the men came in, stamping their boots and shaking off the soot of the day, they would find the house warm and welcoming.

On that particular night, as I went to fill the lamps, Mrs. Kline discovered that we had near exhausted our oil. She grew flurried at once.
“Nikki,” she said, “you must step down to Mr. Grady’s and fetch a fresh tin, else we shall be in darkness before supper. Take the lantern, and mind you keep to Market. Do not go wandering by the ruins. I’ll not have you picking up river talk at this hour.”

By “the ruins” she meant Harrow’s old tallow works, down toward the river—Harrow’s Ruin, as the children called it when they thought their elders could not hear. I had heard the stories as all in Blackwater had: how a man had burned within those walls, shut in by a cruel master; how no body was ever laid in the ground for him; how something walked still where the lamplight ran thin.

I told myself such tales were foolish. I took the lantern from its peg, lit it from the kitchen stove, and wrapped my shawl close.

The air outside smelled of coal smoke and the river, with a sour note from the rendering houses that never quite left our town. The gas lamps along Mill Street burned with their customary weak glow, each sending out its own little ring of yellow. Between one ring and the next, the street lay in shadow.

I kept to the middle stones, my boots striking a steady beat. The lantern swung from my hand, its light clear and straight behind the smudged glass.

For a time all was as usual—men passing with collars turned up, a cart rattling by, a dog barking somewhere beyond the houses. Yet as I drew nearer the turn toward Market, the lantern began to trouble me.

Its flame, which had burned true, leaned suddenly to one side, as if pressed by a draught, though I felt none. It bent not toward the wind, nor away from it, but toward the right—toward the streets that led down to the river and Harrow’s Ruin.

I turned the lantern in my hand, thinking perhaps the wick had grown uneven, and shaded it with my palm.
“Come now,” I whispered, as if it might heed me, “none of that.”

For a moment it steadied. Then again it tilted, straining toward that darker way.

I ought to have gone up Market as Mrs. Kline instructed. It was the longer road, but better lit. Yet when I raised my eyes to the sky, the last of the day’s light was nearly gone, and I thought of the parlor standing cold and lamp‑less and of the men complaining.

“It is only a street,” I said aloud, foolishly, to give myself courage. “Stones and old tales cannot harm me.”

So instead of turning left for Market, I went on toward the river road.

There the lamps stood farther apart, and some were out altogether. The street dipped gently, the cobbles broken in places so that water gathered in shallow hollows, each small pool catching what little light there was.

To my right lay Harrow’s lot, a black tooth in the mouth of the town—charred stones and broken walls left standing since before my birth. Folk often crossed to the far side of the street when they passed it. I did the same, though I told myself it was only to avoid the worst of the ruts.

As I came abreast of the first of those burned stones, the lantern misbehaved more boldly. The flame bent until it nearly brushed the glass, not toward my face or the wind, but sideways—toward the ruin.

The noises of the town seemed to grow distant, as if someone had closed a door between me and the rest of Blackwater. I could still see the faint glow of other lamps farther along, but they felt a long way off.

It was then I saw another light.

Not ahead upon the road, but farther down, where the ground fell to the wharf. At first I thought it some workman’s hand‑lamp, for there was a small, steady flame to be seen. Yet it hung at a curious height, neither near the ground nor high as a street lamp, and there was no pole, no frame, no man’s arm beneath it.

As my eyes adjusted, I perceived that the flame did not stand alone. It crowned a figure.

He—if such it was—stood quite still at the edge of the road by the river, tall and very thin, like a post left long in the weather. The little flame burned just above the place where his head must be, and by that light I traced the slope of shoulders, the fall of a long coat, and the line of limbs that seemed over‑long for any ordinary man.

There was no other light near him. Yet he was plain to see, as if that one flame was enough.

I told myself not to stare. I lowered my gaze, tightened my hold on the lantern, and walked on, though my knees felt uncertain beneath me.

My own steps rang upon the stones. Behind me, another sound began: a tread not like that of a man eager to be home, but slow and dragging, as though each foot were heavier than it ought to be.

Step.
A faint scrape.
Step.

I did not look back.

When I reached the line where Harrow’s Ruin truly began—a low, black wall and beyond it the skeleton of the old works—the lantern lit the stones at my side. In that little circle of light I saw marks I had never noticed, though I must have passed that way a hundred times.

The surface of the stone was marred by deep grooves set in a fan, five together, the span of a hand larger than any I had seen. The stone itself appeared eaten away there, as if some great heat and pressure had been driven into it until it yielded.

The steps behind me ceased.

It is a strange thing, silence. One does not mark its presence until it falls down upon one suddenly, like snow. The distant cart wheels, the river’s soft movement—everything seemed to draw back, leaving me alone in a hollow of stillness.

Something in me whispered: Do not turn. Walk on. If you do not acknowledge him, he may yet pass you by.

I might have obeyed, had my body not betrayed me. My shoulders tensed; my head turned of its own will.

He stood in the middle of the road, nearer than I would have thought possible in so short a time. No more by the wharf now, but in the very midst of that patch of darkness between two lamps.

Up close he was more dreadful than any child’s story.

His coat was not merely worn; it seemed warped and stiff, the cloth puckered and hardened in strange ridges, as though it had once been steeped in some boiling substance and then dried upon him. What bare skin I could see at his throat and wrists shone where the lantern light touched it—not like healthy flesh, but like something that had melted under great heat and then fixed in ridged patterns.

His legs were wrong. They were too long, and the knees turned slightly inward, giving him a crooked stance that made my heart quail.

His head was bowed. I could not see his eyes, nor the full of his face, only the angle of his chin and the dark curve of a mouth that might have been scar or feature. Upon the crown of his skull there rose a short stump, and from its tip sprang the flame.

It burned with a pale glow, not cheerful and yellow like a common candle, but closer to the color of old tallow, with a faint sickliness in it. The air about it did not stir, yet the flame did not falter.

My lantern, which had been so anxious before, now seemed a weak and wavering thing beside that light. Its flame shrank and trembled, as if cowed.

For a few breaths we only stood thus, regarding one another—if indeed he regarded me.

Then his hand rose.

I had thought his limbs long before, but nothing had prepared me for those fingers. They were slender and stretched, the joints knotted, the tips darkened as though they had been held too long to a stove. They moved without any tremor, in a slow and dreadful surety.

I wished to flee. My heart hammered in my chest, and every part of me cried out to turn and run up the hill. Yet I could not stir. It was as if the air had thickened around me and set hard.

His hand came to rest at my throat.

He did not grip me as a rough man might seize a girl. His touch was no stronger than if an acquaintance had laid his fingers there in greeting.

The pain that followed was beyond anything I had ever known.

It came all at once, without warning—the bite of heat so fierce it seemed to shoot straight through skin and sinew and bone. I had once, as a child, brushed my hand too near the oven door and cried at the sting; this was as if that small hurt had been multiplied and pressed into me fivefold.

A scream tore itself from me.

My fingers sprang open. The lantern slipped, fell, and struck the stones at our feet. I heard the crack of glass breaking, then saw, between one heartbeat and the next, the oil running out and taking fire.

A low flame spread upon the ground beside the ruined wall, casting a bright, uneasy light up the black stones.

The hand left my throat.

I clapped my own there at once. The skin beneath my palm felt raised and tender, as though five boils had blossomed in the space of a moment, each the size of a coin.

I could not yet bring myself to look.

He turned from me as though I no longer held his interest.

Instead he stepped—one long, crooked stride—into the little fire upon the stones.

I expected him to start, to jerk back as any man would, but he did not. The flames climbed his blackened coat, curled round his legs, and seemed to sink into him, losing their brightness as they did so.

The light upon the ground grew weaker. The light upon his head grew stronger.

The small flame above his skull swelled, its pale glow deepening, as if fed.

My burns throbbed in time with it. Each pulse of its brightness sent a fresh wave of pain through my throat, so that my vision blurred.

He bent forward slightly, the way a man might bend to warm his hands at a hearth, only it was his head he inclined toward the dying fire. For the briefest instant, as the increased light struck his bowed face, I saw more than I wished to see: hollows where eyes had been, scars running like dried rivulets over what skin remained, a mouth set in an expression of such bound fury and sorrow that it chilled me more than the night air ever could.

Then the last of the spilled oil burned away. The little ground‑flame winked out, leaving only the candle‑flame above him.

In that sudden lessening of light, I felt a strange pull from within myself, as though some part of me were being weighed and measured. The burns at my throat flared, and a peculiar warmth ran along my collarbones and up behind my ears.

He tilted his head, just a fraction, and though I still could not see his eyes, I had the dreadful certainty that he knew me now—not my name as men know one another, but something more private.

I do not know how long we remained thus. At last, he straightened.

Without a word, without so much as a nod, he turned away from me.

His limbs moved with that same uneven gait—one foot dragging a little, then the other—yet he covered the distance quickly. Within a few steps he was swallowed by the dark beyond the reach of my broken lantern. I watched the little flame upon his head recede, a lone spark moving down toward the river, until it too vanished.

My knees failed me then. I sank to the cold stones, hand still pressed to my throat, and wept like a child.

I remember little of how I came home. Mrs. Kline told me afterward that she found me just inside the boarding‑house door, leaning against the wall, my shawl askew and soot smeared along the plaster where my shoulder had slid. The lantern was gone.

The doctor said the marks at my throat were burns from spilled oil, though I never felt a drop upon my skin until his hand lay there. Each mark rose up in a neat oval, five in all, set like the touch of a hand that had never cooled. They did not heal as other hurts do.

In the weeks that followed, whenever the lamps in the house burned low or the coal in the grate sank to embers, those burns would begin to smart and heat, and a queer unease would settle over me. On such nights I would sit awake in my narrow bed, fingers upon my throat, convinced that if I looked to the window I should see a lone, pale light passing in the street below.

I have never again gone by Harrow’s Ruin after dark.

Yet there are times, when the town’s gas runs weak and the streets drop suddenly into gloom, that I feel a stirring in those old wounds and catch, upon my skin, the faintest hint of river‑reek and scorched stone.

When that happens, I douse my own lamps at once and sit very still in the dark, praying that whatever walks Blackwater by that small and dreadful flame will pass my door without pause.
