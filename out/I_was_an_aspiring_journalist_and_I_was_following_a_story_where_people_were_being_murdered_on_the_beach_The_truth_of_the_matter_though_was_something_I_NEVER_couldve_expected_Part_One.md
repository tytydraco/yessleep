The shit I did for my job, let me tell you. I loved to write. I used to write for the school newsletter back in high school.  In college, I actually earned my associates in creative writing. Had I just decided to stick through school instead of taking the first offer a journaling outlet hurled at me to come on full-time with them, I easily could've made out with my Bachelor's -- if not even my Master's degrees.

It would've kept me out of what happened, too, more than likely. Though, I guess it's a good thing I *was* involved the way I was. I'll say right now that none of the names have been changed of those that were involved with this. Well, at least of any of the people I actually *knew*. If what I've seen escalates the way I fear it might, trust me, you'll be glad that you're reading this. I tried already publishing this story to *Porterhouse Press* for their magazine, but they said they won't accept it; claiming it's "Just too unrealistic, and insensitive to families of the victims." Ironic, if you ask me, given *they* were the ones to assign me the project in the first fuckin' place.

I guess their reach has gotten to them, too...

Okay, now that that's out of the way, here's what happened. I wanna say it was about early to mid summer of 2018 that the first body cropped up on the beach at *SunnyShore Resort* (or at least, the first body people *actually* noticed). A giant panic had started over it, as you'd figure it would. The body, a man by the name of Eugene Lester, had seemingly washed up onto the outer edge of the beachfront when he was found in the middle of the afternoon. As the story goes, according to the mass media coverage of the incident at the time, a couple of kids ran screaming to their parents when they found Eugene's body, evidently having been shredded all to bits, crying that there was a shark in the water.

The parents asked where they'd found the supposed shark-attack victim, to which they led them to Eugene's body. The parents, now obviously hysterical, alerted both the lifeguard and the local police to the scene, resulting in the closing of the beach for the rest of the afternoon. The beach stayed closed, too -- until 7:00 a.m. the next morning, of course. That's right, apparently "Possible shark attack", as well as, you know, *finding a fucking mutilated body*, wasn't reasonable enough cause to keep the beaches closed until they could assure public safety.

For whatever reason, though, this was just swept under the rug for the most part, too. Beachgoers and tourists for you, right; couldn't give less than a single damn in the world, so long as they can get their tan on. Well, in any case, things were smooth sailing again afterwards until about a month later, another incident was seen on the news. This time, it was *two* bodies, lying face down in the sand, torn apart like they'd just been passed through a paper shredder. This time, it was a pair of teenagers, a 17 year old Francis Wheeler and 19 year old Rhonda Casquillo. Both of them, just like Eugene, were only ID'd by dental records and from what I heard, even *that* was a challenge because of how few teeth they were even left with.

The biggest difference here, though, is that, while Eugene Lester had at least been found relatively in one piece, Francis and Rhonda were not so lucky. With them, it was just their heads and about half of their torsos a piece. This would be when *SunnyShore* would of course have to close off the beach for the rest of the year. I'll say real quick, though, that I doubt they'd have kept it closed like they did if it didn't happen to already be the end of summer anyways.

Investigations into the murders was brief at best. Like I said, didn't have to be Batman to look at a couple of scraps of meat on the sand and say "Yep, shark attacks. Case closed." People seemed to accept this, too, which was why there was no public outcry against the police as to why there was no real investigations. This, however, wasn't enough to quell the outrage about why they never bothered to take any real proper safety measures to ensure more people wouldn't fall victims to quote-unquote "Shark attacks". Even this was basically waved off by saying they'd "Take better precautions next year to ensure the safety of the public." In other words, "Sorry people were massacred here, and even though we knew (Or at least *should've known*) it was unsafe for patrons, we opened the beach anyways. My bad, teehee, won't happen again, pinky promise."

And of course, they actually bought it. So, okay, you're probably wondering now, "Well *DID* they make good on their word? *Was* the beach safe to return to in the summer of 2019?" Well, to that, I answer with a question of my own, would I be here, telling you this shit now if that were the case?

So late June - early July of 2019 rolls around. Thus far, everything's been smooth sailing, right? No incidents, no dismembered bodies spontaneously washing up from the ocean, just a smooth three weeks of fun at *SunnyShore* resort with the entire beachfront packed slam-full with tourists and vacationers having a grand ol' time kicking off the summer. Everyone was carefree and willing to put the incidents of 2018 behind them and move on, believing *surely* they made good on their word to make sure the beaches were safe this year, right? Then the first week of July rolls around with, you guessed it, another body.

This time, it was a 25 year old aspiring model for *Paramore Quarterly* named Rita Kettle. Would-be "Mrs. Paramore 2019" was found early morning on the same outer edge of the beach as the other three, missing everything but half a torso. Fortunately, the "Sharks" didn't seem to want much else of her, otherwise her fingerprints lifted from her right palm wouldn't have ID'd her. With this, of course, came once again the masses crying foul at *SunnyShore Resort* administration and the authorities. And once again, they simply waved everything off as "Shark attacks". While this wouldn't have raised any eyebrows with any other people who'd already been speculating that something else was behind the killings, it *would* raise eyebrows with the public in general.

By mid July, there was a distinct lack of patrons soaking in the sun along the beach front at *SunnyShore.* Day by day, the number dwindled. Where before, you'd likely have had a hell of a time trying to find a spot to lounge along the beach, now, you'd be lucky to see any more than two, maybe three hundred patrons (and that was pushing it) out at any given moment. People were afraid there were sharks in the water, and weren't about to get suckered by another empty promise again. Though, as I said, it wasn't closed at any point, and enough people would still come out to catch the sun -- and in turn, for some, an early funeral.

The next few bodies were found within only a week of each other. Each one was more horrifically mauled than the other. None of them were found (well, not *reported* anyways), though, until the week after. This was the point where the public stopped believing the constant "Shark attack" story, given the frequency of the deaths as well as the fact that these individuals were apparently among the masses who weren't fond of the ocean anyway. Meaning it was unlikely they'd have even been near the water at any point during their stay at *SunnyShore*. That's when a new possibility was brought into question, could there be a serial killer on the loose on the beach?

This once again forced the beach to close down. This time, it was made clear that, until either a suspect was apprehended, or until it was clear that "Sharks" were no longer any sort of issue, *SunnyShore Resort* would not be opening again to the public. And that was that. For the rest of 2019, *SunnyShore Resort* remained closed. It was hoped, of course that everything would've blown right over by 2020, but not only had authorities found any suspects fitting the murders, but even if they had, well, the lockdown would've scared people away from wanting to vacation at *SunnyShore Resort*, anyways. So 2020 and 2021 also passed by without word from *SunnyShore* as to if and/or when it might be opening the beaches back up again.

By that point, I'm pretty sure most had believed they weren't. It's entirely likely, too, that they'd lost interest, having had to remain indoors for almost 2 years anyway. At least at home, there wasn't the risk of ending up a shredded hunk of meat baking under the sun. Imagine then, the surprise everyone felt when at the beginning of the week, word spread through CNN and across social media that *SunnyShore Resort* was finally going to be reopening its doors to the public at the beginning of June.

Even though no word had spread yet of any arrests for the prior murders or anything, the authorities, sure enough, gave them the green light. And with that, people decided to give *SunnyShore* one last chance. Obviously not without a sense of caution or controversy going around, though. Over the two years the place remained destitute, a small rumor started going around about the "SunnyShore Slasher". While admittedly it wasn't a *huge* rumor in of itself (at least not in my opinion), it was enough for media and magazine outlets to want coverage and information on the topic. Magazines like *World of Weird*.

This is where I come into the picture. See, I'd been doing small puff-pieces as a freelancer for *World of Weird quarterly* for about a year and a half by that point. I was mid way into my sophomore year of college and I wanted to really be able to solidify my writing career with them, so when they offered me this chance, having garnered a small bit of praise for the aforementioned puff pieces, I would, of course, say yes. I will say, though, that I was curious as to why this case in particular was so interesting to them, given that most of their content dealt with mysteries surrounding supernatural phenomena or strange, unexplainable occurrences. Basically, think the dollar store version of *Ripley's Believe it or Not*.

They told me, though, that part of it was that they wanted to see if there even *was* such thing as "The SunnyShore Slasher" and, if so, how hasn't he been caught, AND why were the authorities seemingly so lax with letting the place open back up again, despite never having caught the guy. That, and we'd also been running into a dry spell with new material so we were also just taking anything we could even get at this point. Fair enough, I figured, and that's how I got involved with what I've affectionately dubbed "The *SunnyShore Resort* incident".

It was around the first Friday in June that I got to the beach. It was about a 3 1/2 to 4 hour long drive to *SunnyShore Resort* from where I lived in Mt. Holly N.C. It probably would've taken me longer to get there if traffic were like it was two years ago before the rumors of the "SunnyShore Slasher". As it was, though, There was essentially no real traffic to speak of outside if the normal day-to-day fare. Folks, I guessed, just weren't as hyped as we'd hoped that the beach was opening back up again. That made me a bit worried about how much I was gonna be able to dig up about the whole situation, though.

This idea was solidified a bit further when I saw that the car lots were all but barren, save a few hundred cars here and there. *Great, real interesting story gonna be found here.* I thought as I got out and made my way to the reception desk to book a room for the week. The woman at the reception desk looked like just about every stereotypical desk jockey does in the movies, Tired and wanting to be *literally* anywhere else than stuck behind a piss yellow counter, staring at a computer screen all day for a joint that, by just about all accounts, shouldn't even be operational.

"One room for the week, please." I said as enthusiastically as I could. She looked at me, eyes almost glazed, zombie-like.

"Let me see what we have a vacancy for." She said, sighing.

I chuckled awkwardly and said "It doesn't have to be too fancy or anything, heh heh..." She just ignored me and continued clacking away at her keyboard.

"Looks like we got an opening for one along the beachfront." she said.

"That's perfect."

"Alright, and you said you were planning to stay for a week?"

"Yes ma'am." She began typing on her keyboard again and asked me my name and date of birth. "Maxwell Davidson, Feb. 13th, 1998." She typed that in and I remarked, "You can just call me Matty, though." I tried to snicker at this -- it was an old in-joke my girlfriend would use to tease me with. Clearly it wasn't working on this chick, though, judging from the look on her face that said "Really, dude?" With that, I just lowered my head and waited for her to do her thing so I could go in.

She got out the reservation book and told me to initial and date the specified boxes. "That'll be $276.50. Will it be cash, check, or card?"

"Uh, Card." I replied. I got out the company card given to me by *World of Weird* (Yes it was an "All-expense paid" venture -- you seriously thought I'd pay almost 300 bucks for this trip out of *MY* pocket? Like Hell) and paid for the room. She handed me the keys and I sped-walked out of the office area to my car without another word. The address on the key had me at Room 3 of the *SunnyShore suite* building.

Once I was on the resort, I went in and parked in front of the suite before grabbing my camera and journal and heading out to the beach. It was already getting to be 6:00 by that point, sun was going down and I wanted to get started gathering as much information on the story as I could as early on as possible, so I figured I'd hold off for the time being on getting all set up in the room and all. When I got down to the beach, the air was a smooth breeze and the sun was already a quarter of the way gone. In other words, the weather was perfect, relaxing even (well, to *me*, anyways) -- Yet, there were *maybe* about 100 or so people out on the beach -- if even that.

Now, I bet you're probably thinking "Well yeah, but who usually lays put on the beach at that time of night anyways? How're you gonna soak in the sun if there's no sun?" Fair point, except for the fact that again, *SunnyShore* was known to be slam-full basically from dusk through dawn. Regardless, I started snapping some pictures to use for the piece, particularly looking for any "unnatural" or "out of place" aspects of the beachfront. Aspects such as perhaps a significantly secluded area that'd serve as a dumping site or perhaps even a hideout for the mysterious "SunnyShore Slasher".

Needless to say, though, No such place turned up. Everything was more or less calm, relaxing. Still, The scenery was nice enough so I started snapping pictures anyways. If nothing else, I figured, it'd be nice to have a few pics of just the beach itself to go with the story. Of course -- that meant I actually had to *find* a story.

With this in mind, I decided to start by asking a few of the patrons on the beach of their thoughts. The first was an older, overweight, hairy looking guy chowing down on one of the chili dogs from the nearby hot dog stands. "Excuse me, sir?" I asked. He didn't even look at me, too busy stuffing his fat cheeks with chili. "So, I was wondering. See, I'm not from around here and I was wondering, is it true what they say about this place?" This time he looked at me, mouth still full and dripping with meat and bean juice.

"What's it to ya?" he responded, spewing chunks of food at me with every word out of his mouth. I sighed, wiping off a soggy bit of bread and meat mush that landed in my face. *Fuckin' really, asshole?*

As collected as I could manage, I forced a smile and said "I was just curious to know if you think its true what people are saying about there being a possible maniac on the loose." Fatso just continued glaring at me, chomping his chili dog.

"Yeah, I believe there's somethin' out there." he snapped, spewing more food at me. I wiped my face off -- *again* \-- and asked him what he meant. "It ain't no man."

"What?" I asked, raising my eyebrows. He looked around anxiously before telling me to come closer to whisper in my ear. I hesitated. Even if I *was* afraid of "Big Brother" or whatever, I'd rather deal with that than have this joker spewing literal shit in my ear, too. I waited for him to swallow his mouthful before leaning in to listen to him.

"I think there's somethin' else goin' on." he whispered. "I don't think it was a man that did that to them folks way back when."

"What're you talking about, what did it, then?" I was understandably more than a little confused.

"I think somethin' in the ocean's been gettin' 'em."

"You mean like sharks? You think the rumors about them being shark attacks were real?"

"I thought you said you weren't from around here." he whispered suspiciously.

"I'm not. Like I said, I've heard about the rumors surrounding this place and I figured--" I got no further.

"You're with them, ain't ya? You're a goddamned secret operative or somethin', ain't ya?"

"What, no, I--"

"Yeah, I see what's goin' on, here. You're tryin' to figure out what I know so you can take me away, ain't ya?" He started backing away from me, even cradling the last quarter of his chili dog to him like it was an infant.

"Sir, wait, I--"

But before I could do anything else, fatso was already lumbering down the beach, yelling "You won't probe *MY* mind!"

*Great, off to an AMAZING start here.* I said to myself, sighing. The sun was sinking further and further. Many of the already few patrons that were even on the beach to begin with had by that point left. There were, however, a group of three others, younger looking folks who, hopefully, weren't paranoid fucks who didn't know better than to talk with their mouths full. Well, I was *sorta* right.

They were young, and neither of them were stuffing their faces with chili dogs or anything, but they *were* all but stoned out of their minds. "Yo, what's up!" one of them, a lanky looking kid with dreads called out as I approached. the others turned to look at me, also calling out *"What's up?"*

I sighed again. *Another group of geniuses...*

"Hey guys, you mind if I ask you a few questions?" They started busting up laughing while also scrambling to snuff out the joint they had. "Guys, it's alright, I'm not a cop." The first one stopped, then, his foot raised to stamp out the joint. He stooped back down to draw it back out of the sand before taking another drag of it. "So, I'm not from around here and I was wondering, is it true what the news has been saying about this place?"

They all exchanged glances back and forth between each other before looking back to me, giggling. I rolled my eyes. This was getting me nowhere. I think they *tried* saying something, but between all the giggling and "Oh shit, for real bro" banter, I couldn't make heads or tails of a damn bit of it. One thing I fortunately *was* able to make out was a vague detail about the "SunnyShore Slasher" usually coming out at night. Again, it was vague, and frankly kind of cliche, but it was also the only consistent detail of the differing stories that they'd stick with; between different variants of the guy being either a disgruntled vagrant, a pissed off ex resort employee, as well as the last one claiming he was some sort of Jason Voorhees knockoff, being an undead killer back from the dead after drowning in the beach.

For professional purposes, I went ahead and jotted down these theories (what I *could* of them, anyways), including fatso's half-baked conspiracy about whatever it was being from the ocean. If nothing else, regardless if there *was* any credibility surrounding the "SunnyShore Slasher" or any of the stories surrounding him or not, then I might could at least provide a small piece on the effect of hysteria that such rumors caused. One way or another, I'd have a story.

By the time the three stoners were finished barraging me with three different stories, the sun was all but completely gone, only the faintest light being shown over the horizon. I looked around, seeing nobody around besides us four. I thanked the three for their quote-unquote "Insight" and began walking back to the condo building. I was exhausted, too. Long drive and several hours wasted on the beach with essentially nothing to show. *Just get some rest. Tomorrow morning, wake up and you'll have a fresh throng of interviewees -- ones who might actually have a lick or two of damn sense.*

I made it back to the room, where I took a quick shower and whipped up some dinner. I sat down on the couch to eat when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Nolan. Nolan was my sort of "Sidekick" on the project, offering to look into specific details about *SunnyShore Resort* and its history, as well as any significant historical details about the surrounding area around the beach. It was a message of him asking if I'd made it yet. I told him I had, just a couple of hours ago.

**-- "Found anything yet?"**

\-- "Not really."

**-- "You even started yet?"**

\-- "Yeah, but nobody seems to know anything. Not anything useful, anyways."

**-- "What do you mean?"**

\-- "Well, people think either this fucker's some sort of fish dude or Jason Voorhees. You tell me."

**-- "XD Wow, really?! LMAO"**

\-- "Yeah, fuckin' stupid, right? Makes me wonder if there's gonna be anything worth trying to send off to 'em..."

**-- "What about any sort of posters or banners or shit like that?"**

\-- "What do you mean? What banners?"

**-- "You know, like** ***"Welcome to "SunnyShore Resort", come visit our gift shop where we have the murder weapon used by the "SunnyShore Slasher" himself!"*** **Shit like that.**

\-- "Lol, no. I don't think they're wanting to publicize like that."

**-- "Really? Huh, you'd think that'd make them a killing, you know?"**

\-- "Who knows? Anyway, I'm gonna try again tomorrow with a few of the other locals in the area, see if any of *them* know anything useful."

**-- "Alright, keep me posted. I'll keep seeing if there's anything interesting on my end."**

\-- "Gotcha"

I followed that with a "Thumbs up" before putting the phone back down. After dinner, I decided to look over the little data I actually *had* gathered, seeing if there maybe was something there that I didn't wanna risk overlooking by accident. At the present, I couldn't connect any real dots, *except*, that *something* around the beach area was indeed killing people off and that who or *whatever* it was, definitely had something to do with the ocean. I was also already getting the impression, given the obviously lax approach so far, that the authorities, as well as the *SunnyShore Resort* management as a whole knew something, something they, for whatever reason, didn't want the public getting wise to.

But what?

I decided I'd call it a night at that. Figured, what's the sense in burning out this early on, you know? I didn't have much, sure, but I could've at *least* considered what I had a start, right? I planned to go to the management office the next morning, schedule a meeting with either the CEO of *SunnyShore Resort* himself, Harvey Whitaker, or at the very least, one of the other upper management representatives of the company. Basically, just anybody who'd have enough insight to tell me if there'd been any sort of history with any shady characters in the past such as, say, an ex-employee or an ex-customer, looking to get some sort of payback or something like that.

The next morning, around 8:00 a.m. when it opened, I went down to the office and was greeted to "Tired-ass Tracy", the receptionist again. "What can I do for you, sir?" she groaned.

"Yes, I'd like to speak with one of the administrators, please." She rolled her eyes and began clacking away once again at the keyboard.

"It looks like Mr. Whitaker isn't in his office right now."

"Is there any of the other higher-ups I can speak to?" She turned and typed on her keyboard before facing me again and telling me there weren't. "Well, do you have an idea of when he'll be back?"

She absently shook her head. "If you like, I can take a message. Leave your name, phone number and room number. If your filing a complaint, I can also give you the number to H.R." I just forced a smile.

*Yeah, maybe I will complain.* I thought, saying goodbye and leaving the office. No, I didn't *actually* call H.R. on her. What I *did* do, however, was head back down to the beachfront. Figured it might not be a bad idea to try out the locals again. The sun was only about halfway up by that point and I figured it'd be a few more hours before the idiots would swarm the beach again.

The beach was calm again, just like last night. Obviously, there weren't many people around at all, but I wasn't as caught off guard this time. I know I said this place was usually stuffed to the gills -- pun intended -- but that wasn't till usually *after* 12:30 or 1:00, somewhere in that stretch of time. I started snapping pics again, wanting at least a variety of shots along the beachfront. Some of the nighttime sky, and now some of the early morning. If I was gonna end up with *nothing* for the piece story-wise, then I'd at least have *some* kind of variety with the pics, right?

So anyway, I stood for about 20 minutes, snapping away, when I noticed, at the far end of the beach, toward the boardwalk, a gaggle of seagulls were all clustering together at one central spot just a foot away from the receding tide. Curious, I snapped a picture before walking that way to investigate. I noticed how all of their heads were bopping up and down from the spot, picking at something. *Must be fighting over scraps of a washed up fish or something.*

About a foot away from them, one of the gulls looked over and spotted me before spreading its wings and taking flight. The others soon followed and that's when I was met up close for the first time with the "SunnyShore Slasher's" first victim of the year. The body -- well, maybe I should just say the *torso* \-- was covered in large, deep gashes that didn't leave any bit of it untouched. There were no arms or even a freaking *head* attatched, either! No, just an armless, legless, headless hunk of meat, sitting there in the sand, having been a good deal picked away at by the gulls.

I won't lie, I was sickened. Hell, it was everything I could do to not just up and dump my stomach right there on the beach. *What the fuck?! What happened, who is this and how long have they even been here?* I looked around. Nobody even seemed to notice.

*What am I gonna do?* I wondered, panic starting to mount in my head. Yeah, sure, "Call the cops", obviously, but then what? What'll happen then? Best case scenario, they'll shut the place down again. Great, but then I'll have wasted the trip down here and I wasn't big on the idea of going back to *World of Weird* empty handed. But then again, what if they didn't. In fact, it seemed more likely to me that they wouldn't have, given their actions from the past. One dismembered carcass on the beach -- no biggie, three or four, *THEN* the authorities are concerned.

In the end, and I'll go ahead and say right now that I'm not entirely proud of doing this -- disrespectful to the dead and all, I guess -- I took a few pictures of the remains before running from the site and back to the condo. As soon as I got inside my room, I bolted the door and drew all the curtains before picking up the phone and frantically dialing 911.

**-- "911 dispatch, what is your emegency?"**

\-- "Hello, yes, my name is Maxwell Davidson. I'm in *SunnyShore Resort* and I need to report a murder."

**-- "Okay, and you said you were at the resort?"**

\-- "Yes ma'am."

**-- "Okay sir, and can you tell me where you saw this take place?"**

\-- "It was on the beach, ma'am. I didn't see the murder, I only found the body."

**-- "I see. And you didn't see anyone fleeing the scene?"**

\-- "N-No ma'am, I didn't. I found it just a few minutes ago. It's still there, though."

**-- "Alright sir, I'm sending a unit there now. Are you somewhere safe?"**

\-- "Yeah, I'm in my room in the *SunnyShore suite*."

**-- "Okay, and are there any sharp weapons on you? Is the door unlocked."**

\-- "Um... Y-Yeah..."

**-- "Good. I want you to sit tight where you are. A unit is being sent to your location now."**

The line cut off after that. I was confused. Why was she asking me if I had any sharp weapons? What did that matter. I mean, yeah, I knew they'd sometimes ask that for safety reasons, but I thought that was only done if they were suspicious of you, or if YOU were the one calling to confess to something like this. Granted, I never really knew much of standard police protocol, but still, something about that made me worried.

I realized, though, that I *had* told them that I didn't actually see who or what did it. That means whoever did it is lurking around the beach somewhere, possibly even in the suite. Even if they weren't suspecting me, that would mean I wasn't safe stepping out of the room. I went ahead and unlocked the door, but remained braced against it. Once I hear the knock of the police, I figured, I could open the door then.

While I was waiting, I went ahead and started sending the pictures to Nolan.

\-- "Dude... I just found this..."

**-- "What is this? This a body?!"**

\-- "Yeah!"

**-- "WTF?! Where? When? Who?"**

\-- "I don't know! I was out on the beach again this morning and there it was."

**-- "Have you called the police?"**

\-- "Yeah, I just did. They're on their way. Listen, I need you to print out copies of those pictures for the story, okay?"

**-- "Uh... I mean, okay, yeah, but..."**

\-- "What?"

**-- "I mean, isn't that kind of fucked up?"**

\-- "Look, I know, I know, but I'm gonna have to end up giving the ones I took over to the cops when they get here and dude... I can't really explain it, but something tells me they wouldn't exactly be big on the idea of showing any of this or letting anything reach the public. This might be the only way this isn't completely lost forever, you know?"

**-- "Yeah, alright man. Just please don't go pissing off the wrong people with this. I can't handle another snafu like what happened with your little stint at Area 51."**

I rolled my eyes. He was always teasing me with that one. *It was ONE FUCKING TIME!*

*--* "Look, I'll be fine. Just print those off for me. That way, if nothing else, we'll have at least SOMETHING to show for the project."

I was jolted up when I heard the knock at the door. I slowly stood up and looked through the peephole. Sure enough, it was two female officers standing at my door. I opened the door. "Hello."

"Maxwell Davidson?" the lead officer asked.

"Yeah?"

"We're with the Mecklenburg county P.D. We're responding to a call about a body being discovered." I noticed her starting to peek around the room from the doorway.

"Yes, on the beach." I replied, growing somewhat nervous now. She looked back to me.

"Okay, could you step outside for us, please?" the other officer asked. I hesitated.

"Why?" The two of them fixed me with a cold stare, the kind that told me without telling me that they *really* weren't in the mood to ask me twice.

"Step outside, sir." the lead repeated, somewhat harsher than before. I stepped outside, shaking. Before I knew it, the partner was walking into the suite.

"Hey, what the hell're you--" I was cut off, however, when the lead officer began hemming me against the wall. "Hey, what is this, what're you doing?!"

"Maxwell Davidson, you have the right to remain silent as anything you say or do can and will be--"

"What the hell? What are you talking about, what am I being arrested for?" I got no answer for this. Instead,  She continued to cuff me while I heard the partner tearing through my room. "The fuck!" I exclaimed, "What the fuck're you two doing?!"

The partner came out of the room holding my camera. "Hey, that's my camera!"

"Move it, sir!" barked the lead officer harshly. I was then shoved down the hallway and out of the suite. once out, I was rudely shoved in the back of the police cruiser before being driven to the station about ten to fifteen minutes away from *SunnyShore Resort.* Once there, I was essentially dragged out of the cruiser into the station before being thrown into a chair.

"Hey, easy, what the hell is going on?" The lead officer sat in the chair across from me. She began laying out photos. "Look, this is a mistake!" I exclaimed. "There's a maniac out there and you're harrassing *me?*"

"You recognize any of these folks?" Her voice was monotone, cold and blunt. I looked at the photos. They were all of shredded human remains, all having been found on the beach.

"What the fuck, no I haven't seen these people before!" The two officers glared at me. "What, *I* didn't do this! How *could* I?"

"How?" the lead officer asked. "Well, the way I understand, you had no trouble offing that poor bastard you confessed on the phone abo--"

"Whoa, whoa, *confessed?* I didn't *confess* to shit!" I was about to jump from my chair when I watched the partner reaching for something in her belt.

"Yeah, I'd advise keepin' yourself in check, there, boy." she said coldly.

"Look, I didn't kill anybody, okay? I saw that body and immediately called you."

"Oh really?" lead officer asked. "The "First thing you did", huh?" She held up my camera. "So you decided *after* you called us to start snapping pictures of your latest accomplishment?"

"What? No, I didn't--"

"So here's the story as I understand it; you, after all this time, come around here after we *finally* get the place opened back up again just to start up your little killing spree again."

"WHAT?!" I screamed. The partner reared back to her belt again. "What the fuck are you talking about, I *didn't kill anyone!*" She turned to her partner.

"Yeah, that'd sound about right to me, what about you?" The partner just kept eyeing me, nodding in agreeance.

"I couldn't have killed them! I don't know them, Hell, I've never seen these fuckers before in my life!"

"Give me one good reason why I'm supposed to believe you."

"What do you mean? I already told you, I called you *right after* I found that body!"

"Your latest victim, you mean?" she asked. My body began shaking violently.

"Goddamn it, have you heard a *single* word I've said? I. Did. Not. Kill. *ANYBODY!* The maniac's still out there!"

"Then why're you taking their pictures?" the partner asked, still glaring daggers at me. "You press?"

"No. I mean, not--"

"You shooting a movie, is that it? You trying to shoot a snuff film?"

"The fuck? Do you people hear yourselves? A "Snuff film", really?"

"So you admit it was for your sick collection?" lead officer asked.

"NO!" I shouted, this time bolting from the chair. I was ready to wrap my hands around both their throats and start shaking the hell out of them to make them fucking listen to me. The only reason I didn't was because as soon as I was to my feet again, Ms. trigger-happy partner drew her gun and aimed it directly between my eyes.

"You know this isn't exactly helping your case, here." lead officer chided. I stayed locked in a staring match with the partner for another minute and a half before diverting my eyes back to the lead officer.

I closed my eyes and inhaled. "I took those pictures because I'm here with a magazine company." Lead officer glanced over to her partner. Partner just remained focused on me.

"I thought you said you weren't with the press."

"I'm not. we're just a startup."

"What "Magazine"?" she asked, using air-quotes.

"*World of Weird*."

"Never heard of it." She looked to the partner again. Again, the partner wouldn't take her eyes (or her gun) away from me as she shook her head.

"You probably wouldn't. Like I said, startup journaling house. Just started back in late 2017 and we haven't picked up much traction."

"So why'd they send you? Why here?"

"Well, to find the same thing you're looking for, more or less."

"What do you mean?"

"I was sent to see if there was any truth to the stories. I only heard about 'em myself just a couple weeks ago when I was given the assignment. Like I've been saying, I'm not even from around here."

"So they sent an out-of-towner here to the resort on some sort of journalism snipe-hunt?" I noticed she had this weird sort of reassurance in her voice when she said this. Like she was glad to hear it, that I was, quote-unquote, "an out-of-towner on a snipe-hunt".

"Uh... S-Sure... but I don't--" She stood up and waved for the partner to take her gun off me.

"Alright, Mr. Davidson, you're free to go. Sorry for any inconvenience. We'll be escorting you back to the resort." I stood dumbly.

"Huh?"

"You were right, we jumped the gun there. We *will,* however be keeping your little camera, here. Don't need you going around trying to spook folks around here when it's clearly nothing but a shark attack."

"Wait, what?" I exclaimed. "But I need my camera."

She just looked at me with a shit-eating smirk and replied, "Again, give my regards to *"Planet of Bizarroland"* or whatever." The two then left before two more officers came in and escorted me out to the cruiser to take me back to the resort.

On the ride back, one thing kept repeating in my mind. That was too easy. Everything about that situation was *wrong*. For starters, despite being so quick to supposedly believe I'd done it, then "confess over the phone", they never tried making me show them where I'd even found the body. Not only that, but they were so quick to let me go after I told them about *World of Weird*, readily dismissing me as just a wingnut spouting bullshit and writing off yet another murder as "just another shark attack".

To top all of that off, they were adamant about keeping my camera, JUST to be able to keep to this story. In other words, I couldn't tell whether they, themselves, actually believed in the legends of the "SunnyShore Slasher" or if they were just trying to shut everybody up. One thing I *was* 100% certain of, though, was that there was definitely something they weren't wanting me to see, and it definitely had something to do with the bodies.
