I live In Pennsylvania in a cottage by myself. Having always been a fan of exploring nature, I bought it mainly for the forest in the backyard, and the absence of light pollution. (I have a hobby of astrophotography and never really got to see the Milky Way in person growing up). For the first few months of me living here, nothing went wrong, I got tons of wild life, privacy, amazing views in the night sky, and even found a small pond in the woods behind my house which I periodically fish in.

Its not until last week I cam across a small, 2 to 3 foot wide dark wooden trapdoor padlocked shut surrounded by a thick slab of concrete. Now keep in mind there were no trails leading to this, and the nearest house to mine was beyond the means of walking here. Always being a sort of curious person, I longed to peek through. Three wooden planks made up the surface of the trapdoor leaving 2 small cracks in between each of them. Bending down uncomfortably on my knees and pressing my right eye  through the planks attempting to see inside. Darkness. I couldn't see anything there. I shined my flashlight from my phone into the crack trying to see. Cobble stone walls and cobwebs, and what I could make out to be a rusty, iron ladder met my eyes. I spent 2 or so minutes peering into the crack trying to make out what could be at the bottom. Nothing. A small, metal, clanking noise originating from the bottom of the pit sounded out.

I got up, startled by the sudden sound and left, Feeling uncomfortable. Since that incident I never went back. I had no desire to. but after days of wondering what could be in there, I grabbed my hatchet, and set off to find the trapdoor intending to crack the padlock off and look inside. After about like 10 minutes of trying to find where I last saw it again, I came across surprised to see the small, wooden trapdoor ajar, revealing the dirty cobblestone pit leading into darkness. I debated on going in or not. Nervous on what could be down there, I Instead tied a rope to my camera while flash recording and lowered it down into the pit. I could hear it hit the stony ground. waiting a few seconds, before pulling the camera back up. I looked through the film. Most of it just scraping on the dark metal ladder and the cobblestone walls. I fast forwarded to the end, finally hitting the floor. The flash showed an open wooden door leading to a room. I couldn't tell what was inside of it from the suns glare on the screen.

seeing the bottom of the pit to be empty, my curiosity took the better of me as I reluctantly hoisted myself slowly down the rusted ladder into the darkness. With nothing but my cameras flashlight. Hitting the dusty concrete I pushed the door open, regretting being down here in the first place. A putrid, rotting smell filled my nose. I shined my light in the room. A single chair covered in red stains, And a lightbulb above rested in the middle of the concrete room. a table of various tools, a rope, and a pile of blood stained clothes lay to the right. I wanted to get the hell out of here. to leave. But another opened door was on the other side of the room. not daring to walk any further I shined my light in the direction of the door. Hanging, red, and fresh meat hung from the ceiling. about 5 to 6 feet tall hanging like a damn punching bag. I felt sick to my stomach. closed the old door and got the fuck out of there. Climbing up the iron ladder frantically, I pulled myself out of the trap door, slammed it shut, and ran home.

I haven't been back in the woods yet. I have no desire to. After I called the cops and led them to the hole, I stood at the top with another officer by me while the two others decended into the hole. After a few minutes of silence and a loud

"Holy shit." from one of the officers inside, they climbed back up wide eyed and told me to go home while they searched the area. They never told me anything since. They never told me what was in that room of hanging, skinned, meat. And to be honest. I hope they never do.
