I never thought a painting could ruin someone’s life—but then again, my brother was always different.

He’s always been a strange guy, often lost in thoughts that seem just out of reach—like his theory that colors evoke emotions more powerfully than words. It’s not entirely baseless, but it feels detached from reality. He sees himself as an “artiste,” constantly rebelling against the mundane. His paintings, though technically skilled, lack the spark that makes them remarkable. He insists, “The real world doesn’t sell,” but neither do his paintings.

Don’t get me wrong; I love him. He’s always been there for me in his own way. Like that time he scared off my bullies with a few quiet, cutting words. I still don’t know what he said, but they never bothered me again. That’s just who he is—someone who seems to understand people in ways I envy.

Not everyone sees him like I do. He’s eccentric, and most people write him off as absentminded. But to me, he’s always been more than just my older brother. He practically raised me after Dad left. Sure, he’s frustrating at times—he drifts through life while I clean up the messes. I paid Mom’s bills when she couldn’t work and helped him with his rent more times than I can count. Still, he’s my brother, and even if his paintings aren’t great, I’ve always admired his dedication.

That’s why his disappearance hit me so hard.

We usually text a few times a week, but in October, he went silent. At first, I wasn’t worried; he does this sometimes. He’ll disappear for a few weeks, then reappear, inviting me over to see his latest “masterpiece.” His work is always technically brilliant, but the concepts tend to be… lacking. I’d smile and nod, feigning interest because I know how much it means to him.

By mid-October, though, something felt off. My texts went unanswered. Even his social media went quiet. I assumed he was sulking—he’s sensitive and hates criticism. Maybe he thought I wasn’t being honest about his art. But as the weeks dragged on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was different.

When November rolled around, I called our mom. She hadn’t heard from him either. That’s when I knew something was seriously wrong. We decided to check his apartment. Mom has a spare key, but I asked her to wait in the hallway while I went inside. I don’t know what I expected—maybe the worst. But when I opened the door, everything looked… normal.

His apartment was neat, almost eerily so. There were unfinished canvases scattered around, which was strange. He never starts a new piece until the last one is complete. The air was stale, like the place had been empty for a while.

In his bedroom, I found an open laptop resting on his perfectly made bed and, beside it, a journal. He’s always kept journals, saying they help him organize his thoughts. I picked it up, hoping it would give me some clue about where he went.

Flipping through the pages, I saw the familiar chaotic mix of sketches, notes, and thoughts. But it was the last entry before he stopped responding to me that caught my attention.

>“I’ve struggled to find real inspiration lately, but that’s changed. My brother always enjoys my Halloween pieces, but this year, he’s going to love what I create. Finding genuine inspiration is a pain, but the internet never disappoints. I discovered a streamer named Caitastrophe. Her name is Caitlin, and there’s something about her I can’t get out of my head. Her ethereal theme has my mind spinning. I hope she doesn’t mind, but I think combining her beauty with a ghost-like design could lead to an incredible painting, something perfect for Halloween. He’s going to love it.”

I don’t know why, but reading that gave me chills. I’d never heard him mention this Caitlin before. Something about the way he described her felt… off. I couldn’t shake the feeling that my brother had found exactly what he was looking for—and that it had already taken hold of him.
