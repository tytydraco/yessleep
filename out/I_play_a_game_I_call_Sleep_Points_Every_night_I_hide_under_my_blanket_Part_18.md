Okay, I get it.  So, it was probably a pretty big letdown for that last part to have all been a dream.  But let’s face it: I was never gonna get out of that one alive if it had been real.  As disappointing as it might be to read that none of it happened in the real world, I for one, was extraordinarily grateful for none of it to have had any serious consequences.

Though it did feel entirely real, nonetheless.  I took a look at my legs and feet.  There wasn’t any snow there.  Not even the slightest drop of moisture.  And my body was completely warm.  My legs were just fine too.  I also tried to feel around for that enormous gash that I had thought for sure The Sandman had given me when I was running away from it, but that wasn’t there either.

I did some research online and found out that apparently, melatonin can kinda fuck with your dreams and give really weird and vivid ones.  Part of me still wanted to believe that that was all it was, but I knew better than to let myself slide back into delusions about there being some rational explanation here.  This was Sleep Points related, and if I knew what was good for me, I was gonna have to go to Anastasia with this if she didn’t already have some way of knowing.  But she probably did.

I remembered what Ezra had said in my dream about The Sacred Space and how you could spend sleep points there.  Maybe this Sacred Space was somewhere you could only go to if you were asleep.  It would kinda make sense, after all, that you would have to already be asleep in order to spend sleep points on anything.  But then there was the fact that he had led me to the school.  And College High obviously existed outside of my dreams.  So maybe there was some sort of Sacred Space or Sanctuary in the real world behind the wall I had seen him run headlong into at the end of my dream, when my dad finally shook me awake.  Maybe I wouldn’t even need to be asleep to access it.

Anyway, my theory at that point was that Anastasia must’ve been going to this Sacred Space, probably in a dream or something, and then spending sleep points there to find all sorts of things out about me.  Well, all sorts of things besides how well or how long I had slept.  Apparently, she still had to ask me directly about that.  But anyway, if all this was true, it would mean that she already knew that I had the dream of Ezra leading me to The Sacred Space and would know what it meant.  I figured it had to have meant something since I had never had it before, up until that previous night.  This must’ve meant that things in the game were changing for me somehow.

As excited as I was to start spending sleep points, I still just couldn’t explain to mysself why now, all of a sudden, I had access to them when I didn’t previously.  What changed?  Why didn’t I have that dream on the first night of Sleep Points?  Maybe this was a matter of needing to make it to Stage Two.  Maybe the game expects you to pay your dues a little by forcing you to spend a few weeks in the game rising through the ranks a bit before allowing any purchases with sleep points.  Maybe you have to prove yourself a bit and show that you can survive the game.  That way you’ve demonstrated that whatever you’re getting with sleep points isn’t just gonna get wasted on someone who loses the game on the very next night, or something like that.

But at that moment, I had more pressing issues to worry about.  My dad was not gonna be happy that I had overslept, and on the day of my Environmental Science Poster Presentation, no less.  He’d surely want to know why I had been so irresponsible.  I had to come up with some sort of excuse.  I had totally forgotten about how I had turned the alarm off the first night of Stage Two.  I just knew I wouldn’t be needing it the following morning and didn’t bother to think beyond that.  The alarm still being activated was the whole basis for my plan surrounding how I’d wake myself up after eating all those melatonin gummies.  Which, I now knew, had been a lot more effective than I had realized.

But dad didn’t ask for any explanation.  He didn’t seem too upset that I had overslept at all, in fact.  He told me that he knew I had been having trouble sleeping from the call he had gotten from Mrs. Bagfield the day before, and that he decided that, since he was taking the day off already, he’d let me sleep in.  Apparently, he had to take off work that day to have a routine colonoscopy done.  Since he would be knocked out completely under anesthesia for an hour or two, he would have to call out of work anyway.

See THAT was just the sort of thing I could’ve used.  If I had some operation at the hospital that required anesthesia, I could knock out my 90 required minutes of sleep just like that.  I know it sounds weird, since obviously no one wants to undergo big medical procedures like that.  It isn’t exactly the sort of thing that the average person would be holding out for.  But in my position, it would guarantee me another 72 hours before I ever had to worry about sleep again.  Which, to me, was totally worth it.  Though granted, seeing as I how had just woken up from a bout of sleep that lasted longer than 90 minutes, it wouldn’t’ve done me a whole lotta good right then, specifically.

There had to be something like that that I could buy in the Sacred Space.  Obviously not something as extreme as anesthesia, though.  I didn’t need anything NEARLY that strong.  Even if they DID have it, I would have no idea what to do with it.  I wouldn’t have anywhere NEAR enough medical know-how to administer it to ANYONE.  Let alone MYSELF.

But still, there had to be something in The Sacred Space that could still reliably do the job.  Something or other that would be a surefire way to make sure I stayed asleep for 90 minutes straight.  But then I remembered that the melatonin gummies had actually done their job, so maybe I wouldn’t even need to resort to any of that after all.  But then there was still the fact that I needed to eat the entire case of 60 in order to get myself to sleep.

Once dad left, I checked on the melatonin gummy container that I kept hidden in my drawer, just to see if I really HAD blown through every last one of ‘em like I had thought.  I didn’t wanna just leave the container lying out, since mom or dad would be sure to ask questions.  Sure, they couldn’t see or hear the clock or The Sandman, but those were all Sleep Points related things.  That melatonin gummy container seemed like it was just a completely ordinary container, that anyone, whether they were playing Sleep Points or not, would be able to easily see.

The funny thing was, when I opened up the drawer to go throw away the container, since I was still expecting it to be empty, it was actually mostly full, to my surprise.  Since dad seemed to be letting me take my time getting ready seeing as how his operation wasn’t until 11:45, I counted them all out to see just how many were left, since it looked like a lot.  There were 50.  That meant I had only eaten 10.  I hadn’t even needed to go beyond Anastasia’s maximum recommendation.

So why did I think I had eaten them all?  My only guess was that that must’ve been part of the dream too.  I had figured that I must’ve been so deeply afraid of eating them all without anything working, seeing as how nothing had worked up until then, that I had a nightmare about eating them all, only to have the whole ordeal accomplish nothing.  That would also explain why I couldn’t break the clock.  It could probably have been easily broken in real life, but because I was so afraid of what was gonna happen at 6 AM if I didn’t even have THAT off-ramp available to me, I must’ve dreamt that I couldn’t break it.

Anyway, dad started driving me over to school at about 11:00, after I had made myself a bowl of cereal.  Mom was already at work, so she wasn’t there to make breakfast like usual.  But it was just as well, since breakfast needed to be fairly quick so that dad could get to the doctors on time for his procedure.  Thankfully, I didn’t get into any trouble for being late to school.  Dad had written me a note that excused me for being late, and he showed it to the principal, explaining how I hadn’t been sleeping very well lately and how I was gonna need a good night’s sleep before the big presentation 6th period.

I gave the late slip to Mr. Springer, my history teacher, and got situated into 4th period.  Then there was lunch, where I thankfully ate everything as usual, now that my appetite had returned from getting some much-needed shut-eye.  And then came 5th period, where Mrs. Bagfield could easily see that I was much more awake and lucid than the day before, where I was just kinda going through everything in this total zombified state after two nights of no sleep.

Then finally, it was time for 6th period.  Since everyone was finished with all their research, we didn’t go back to the library’s computer section that day.  Once again, Mr. Brigham was shuffling around a cup of popsicle sticks to see which group would be called up.  Instead of each individual student having their own popsicle stick like at the beginning of the project, now each group got a stick.

There were about 20 kids in the class, so that meant 10 pairs.  Each pair had about 5 minutes to complete their presentation to make sure Mr. Brigham would get to everyone within one 50-minute class period.  At the beginning of the project, he had made it clear that he wanted to get through everyone’s presentations in one class period, since he wanted to move on to our geology unit as soon as possible, since our class had been running behind even before we were assigned our Food Chain project.  We must’ve been “running behind” for a few solid MONTHS by then.

As much as I might’ve been upset before about Anastasia not trusting me enough to give me all that much to do, I was totally cool with her taking things from here, as far as our presentation was concerned.  Even after the week we had spent on the project, I still hardly knew the basics.  I knew which animals were at the top of the food chain and which ones were toward the bottom.  I had printed out and labeled a spectrum from “predator” to “prey”, but between that and sectioning off which plants and animals went where, that was basically the full extent of my contribution.  All of the actual information on display was thanks to Anastasia.

I didn’t know nearly enough to talk at length about what we, or realistically SHE, had been researching for the past week.  And certainly not enough to do it in front of my whole class.  But if Anastasia could just leave the public speaking to her, maybe this presentation wouldn’t end up a total disaster.  Given how she seemed to be talking yesterday out in the stairwell, she might’ve already BEEN preparing to do the presentation all by herself.  I remembered getting the worrying sense that she wouldn’t’ve been surprised to have not seen me at all the next day, given how slow-going my sleep points progress had been by then.

But that was another funny thing:  when I showed up to class, I was expecting her to be over the moon that I had made it out the other side of 6 AM alive and that I wasn’t totally doomed, like she seemed to think.  But when she saw me come in, she just acted like she hadn’t thought anything of it.  Though, then again, maybe she had to mask her surprise, since it probably wouldn’t’ve made sense for her to be so outwardly shocked to see me.  It’d be pretty tough to explain away without talking about Sleep Points if anybody was to ask questions.  So she might’ve just been playing it safe, in that case.

Anyway, I had hoped that I could coast through the whole thing with Anastasia doing all the talking, but just like on Tuesday when Mr. Brigham had lectured Anastasia about how this was a GROUP project and we BOTH needed to contribute, including me, he insisted that I do some talking as well by asking me what I, specifically, had researched.  I started off going on about the layout of the poster and a few basic graphics I had included, like pictures of animals and marshland vegetation and that sort of thing.  But Mr. Brigham wasn’t satisfied with that, since none of it had to do with any actual research I had done. And, on top of that, we still had a minute to go.  Which meant that I still had an entire minute’s worth of talking to do in front of me.

There was an awkward pause while I racked my brain trying to come up with things I had learned from the utterly useless research I had done that I was both never gonna use in the real world and that Anastasia had probably researched first anyway.  But eventually, I landed on the characteristically soft-stemmed vegetation of the Florida everglades and the important role it plays as the bedrock of the food chain and ecosystem, being that, as with basically any type of food chain, plants are gonna be right at the bottom.  I forgot exactly WHY the vegetation of the marshlands were so soft-stemmed.  There was probably SOME kinda biological or evolutionary reason for it.  But fortunately, I didn’t have to go into it, because before I would have to cross THAT bridge, our time was up anyway, and the next group started getting THEIR poster set up.

Even though I was all done with everything I had to do for class that day, that didn’t mean I could use the rest of my class time to go to Anastasia for any further Sleep Points information.  I still had to sit at my desk and watch everyone else’s presentations for the rest of class. I was hoping to ask her about my dream, but since our project was done, it was back to the way things were before, where we would sit on opposite sides of the room with no way to talk to each other.  It kinda felt like the end of an era, in a way.  That past week, every day I went to school, Anastasia would ask me how I slept and would answer at least one or two questions that I had wanted answers to.  But now that we weren’t working together on a school project anymore, those days were done.

Now I would have to wait for the weekend to talk to her about anything.  But at least I would still have THOSE meetings to look forward to.  Even if I couldn’t talk to her every day, we would still keep in touch.  Or at least I ASSUMED we would.  Maybe she had given me all the help she had planned on giving me.  Maybe, now that I had fallen asleep for the first time during Stage Two, she was gonna treat me like I needed to be on my own from now on.   I thought about asking her if our weekend plans would still be on at the end of class.  I just wanted confirmation that, even though the project was over and I made it through last night alive, we were still on for Saturday morning, same time, same place.

I was worried that it was gonna be just like the week before, where she would be off to some other class before I could talk to her.  But thankfully at the end of class, she waited at her desk for me to get up and leave.   Once I got to her desk, she got up and gave me a look telling me I should follow her out to the hallway.  Once we were far enough out of earshot of anyone, she finally expressed how happy she was to see that I was still alive and well.  I took the opportunity to ask her if I should still come to her house on Saturday morning at 2:05 AM.  I REALLY wanted to be sure that that was still the plan, since the last thing I wanted was to show up at her house uninvited and surprise her by trespassing or anything.

She said I should still come to her house on Saturday morning, but that she wanted me to show up at 1:05 so that way we’d have an extra hour to discuss things.  She said that she didn’t appreciate how long we had spent talking past one another on Sunday morning, during our last meeting where I walked over instead of driving in the truck.  She also talked about how, with Stage 3 coming up and with how much trouble I had been having with falling asleep even WITH the waning moon, something that was apparently SUPPOSED to make sleep come easier, that she was going to need more time with me one-on-one for us to discuss my survival plans moving forward in the game.

I didn’t know why she was acting like Stage Three was coming up so soon.  I mean, I had only just STARTED Stage Two.  Today was February 28th, and Stage Three wouldn’t begin until March 25th.  I still had over three weeks left.  25 days.  That was even longer than the amount of time since the 11th, when I had first started playing in the first place.  And those 17 days had ALREADY felt like an eternity.

Just like how those 17 days have probably felt like an eternity for you guys as well, looking at how long it’s taken me to finally sit my ass down and finish writing about them.  And those days were 5 years ago by now, so you can already tell that we’ve only just begun.  Although, as the game progressed, fewer and fewer new and shocking things would happen, so even though the story has been a bit slow-going so far, it’ll probably pick up the pace soon enough.

Anyway, I tried telling Anastasia about the dream I had, but I guess she decided that our time talking to each other was over once I got myself started, since she sped off to her next class before I could go into it.  Which hopefully meant that the dream was nothing, looking at how dismissive she had seemed to be about the whole thing.

As I walked over to the bus, I saw Truman and told myself it must’ve been time once again for him to hassle me for Sleep Points advice.  But today was different.  Instead of asking for any new information, he said he was thankful for what I had already told him.  When I tried asking why, he gave the answer that I had feared most of all: my advice about dealing with The Sandman.

I had thought I had noticed Truman losing his usual vigorous swagger.  Even more so than the first time he had come to me for advice.  Even then, he could still kinda put on a mask and act like he was alright.   But now, he just looked totally drained.  He looked so much more tired than I had felt after my first night of no sleep.  Hell even after TWO nights.  The moment I saw him I could already feel the fear swelling up inside me, as though one look was all took for me to know on some instinctual level what he must’ve done.  But I didn’t want it to be true.  I asked further.  I asked him what he meant by that.  What ABOUT my advice for dealing with The Sandman?

“Oh, y’know," he said with a vaguely dazed-looking smile.  "How to get ridda the asshole".
