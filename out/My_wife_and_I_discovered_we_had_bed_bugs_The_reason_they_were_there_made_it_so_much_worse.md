“It’s definitely a bed bug,” the exterminator’s voice cracked over the speakerphone. 

“A bed bug?” I groaned.

“Yes. We couldn’t identify it at first because the species is so rare. Usually, this one comes from the tropics, like South America.”

“Damn.” I muted myself and turned to my wife. “How the hell did a tropical bed bug get in our bedroom?”

“I don’t know.” She shrugged, despondent.

“Still there?”

I unmuted. “Yeah.”

“If I do the treatment, you’ll need to pull all your furniture from the walls and bag up every loose item and store them outside. That way I can spread the fungus along the beds and floorboards. The stuff is non-toxic to humans, but it’ll kill the bugs in a few weeks.” 

I shuddered. All I could think about were those parasites crawling over my body. Sinking their incisor-like jaws into my arms and legs.

“How much does it cost?”

“Seventeen hundred bucks.” 

*What?!* I nearly passed out. 

“I can come in as early as next week.”

I turned to my wife, “That’s a lot of money.”

“I don’t think we have much of a choice.”

We went ahead with the extermination. The next five days were chaos. 

My wife and I bagged every loose item in our bedroom and hauled them outside. We boxed every toy, book, and article of clothing in our toddler’s room and stored them in the closet. We pulled back our furniture so that there was enough space on all sides to move freely. It was back-breaking work, but it was necessary to kill the pests.

“Where are the bugs, Daddy?!” Our toddler kept saying as we shifted his furniture around.

“Hiding in the walls, Son. Someone’s going to come save us.”

For those who don’t know, bed bugs reproduce at an alarming rate. One female can lay up to seven eggs per day. Eggs can hatch in nine days. Juveniles can reach maturity and reproduce in four weeks. Without any intervention, an infestation will double every two weeks.

Since my last call with the tech, my wife and I had been bit several times, waking up with painful welts all over our bodies. Even our toddler had been fed on. An infected bump ballooned on his forehead and looked like a third eye.

“Oh my god!” my wife said, rubbing calamine lotion on his wound. “Are you okay, Sweetie?”

“Yes, Mommy.”

“I can’t take this anymore!”

About halfway through her panic attack, the exterminator called me.  

“How’s it going?” 

“We’re almost done packing.” I scratched at a fresh welt on my elbow. “We’ve only got two more bags to fill.” 

“Sounds like you’re doing a good job. Hang on ’til I get there.”

***

The tech arrived at our house on Friday at 10 AM.

“Everything ready?” 

“Yes… right this way…”

We practically pulled him inside.

“Wow. You’ve done great.”

Both of our rooms looked like humans had never lived there. Furniture was stacked on one another like Jenga towers. Every unorganized item had been removed and stored in the garage or closet.

“Are you here to save us?” Our son asked from the hallway.

“Yes, sir.” The technician smiled and ruffled his hair. “I’m gonna set you up so that this never happens again.”

***

The exterminator moved quickly, planting his fungus along the floorboards and furniture.

I watched him work with desperate satisfaction. One of my arms had nearly twelve bites now. There must have been ten bed bugs in the house, feasting on us every few nights. I imagined them watching from the walls, observing their oncoming demise.

By 11:15 AM, the tech was finished. 

“Y’all should be good now.” He gathered his gear. “Just slowly start to unpack. The bugs should be dead within a few weeks.”

***

Within a month, the bites had stopped. My wife and I could sleep peacefully again. Life was normal, so it seemed.

About six months into our newfound freedom, I received a call.

“Mr. S*****?”

“Yes?” 

“I work with ****** Law office. Did ***** Pest Control service your house in the past year?”

“Yes, we had bed bugs in March. But they’re gone now.”

“You may be entitled to a sizable settlement.”

“A what?!” 

“Can you come by our office? We have something to show you.”

***

My wife and son and I arrived at the attorney’s that afternoon.

“I appreciate you coming in on such late notice.” The lawyer shook our hands as we settled into a conference room.

“What’s this about?” I placed my son on my lap.

“We’ve been building a case against a local pest control company for the past two years, specifically with one of their technicians.”

“That sounds awful,” my wife mused.

“It’s taken us some time, but I think we’ve gathered enough evidence.”

“For what?”

“Can I ask you something? Do you know how you got bed bugs?”

My wife and I looked at each other. We’d thought about it but hadn’t pinned down an explanation.

“You haven’t traveled to anywhere tropical or…?”

“No. We’ve been in town for the past five years.” I admitted. “The farthest we’ve gone is wine country.”

“I understand. Please watch this and tell me what you see.”

The attorney pulled out her tablet and pressed ‘play.’ A video popped up of a pest control technician spraying an ordinary backyard.

My wife and I leaned close. A hat was pulled over the tech’s face. But when he lifted his sprayer to cover the awning, his personage came into view.

“Oh my god,” I said. “That’s the guy we hired earlier this year.”

“We have hours of similar footage.”

“Why bring us in?”

“Because… one of our clients gave us this.”

She pulled up another video. The camera, which must have been mounted inside of a bird house, showed our exterminator spraying outside someone’s garage. Nothing unusual. But then…

… when he reached the side yard, he stooped down and pulled something from his jacket.

“What is that?” My wife asked.

The attorney clicked another button and the angle changed. Now we were staring straight-on at the tech. 

He was dumping something out of a tiny plastic bucket. The camera’s angle and clarity allowed us to see…

Bed bugs…

… hundreds of them, tumbling out like wingless flies. The spot where they landed was on stonework painted white, which made them easier to see. 

“Oh my god,” my wife gasped, covering her mouth.

The sight of them tumbling over each other, squirming like ants fighting over spilled syrup, made me want to vomit. 

“Apparently, this technician has been dumping these parasites all over town, then servicing his clients to deal with the infestations.”

“Unbelievable,” I gasped, so traumatized I could barely breathe.

***

About one year later, we received a check in the mail. It was from ***** Pest Control for six thousand dollars. There had been hundreds of clients impacted in our community. My wife and I had fought for a bigger payout, but the fact that our tech had been caught and was facing consequences meant the world to us.

“At least he won’t be able to do that to anyone else,” my wife said.

“Yeah. At least…”

That night, I dreamt about those bloodthirsty pests. One crawled up my leg and stopped at my stomach, leaving a soupy red welt.

The next morning, I awoke to a battering of knocks at the front door. 

*What the hell is that? The mail?*

I stumbled to the entryway and peered into the eyehole. A figure was standing with their back to the glass.

I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and opened the door, seeing… 

… a young man with sickly, rash-covered skin. His eyes were fixed into an eerie stare. His lips were locked into a painful grin. He looked like he hadn’t slept in weeks.

“Hello?”

Without a word, he set a clear plastic box on the ground, then dashed away and disappeared down the street. 

“Hey!” I called after him. “What is this? Come back!”

I glanced down at the container.

There were countless bed bugs inside. Squirming. Desperate for a way out.
