I feel really weird writing this, but I have to talk about this so you know what is going on too. 25 years ago when I was 5 there was this thing called the ”boogeyman”. When I first heard about It I would not sleep until my Dad would check everywhere. Under the bed,The closet, Everywhere. When he checked everywhere I would feel safe and go to sleep, After 2 months it finally happened He showed up, The Boogeyman.

On the night he showed up I went to my room and played for a few minutes and went to sleep at 9:00. It was 10:00 when he showed up, I forgot to ask my dad to check everywhere. I heard the closet creak open, I shot up and looked around not taking a second to blink. When I looked into the dark and creepy closet it was nothing. I think I’m hallucinating i said in my head. As soon as I said that the door to my room flung open, and a big black flash flew across the doorway.

WHAT THE F\*\*\* I said aloud. I quickly rushed through the door and  through the hallway and went in the my parents room. I flung the door open and quickly rushed to the bed. “Why are they under the covers?” I said. I pulled the sheets off and it was pillows underneath. I got scared, I kept thinking to myself where are they, did they get caught by him? As soon as I processed it I knew what that black flash and where my parents would be. I ran to the living room.

When I got to the living room I looked around twice.I looked at the couch and saw my dad watching tv.

I said hey to him but he didn’t respond, so I walked around the couch and looked at his face. My mouth dropped when I saw it. His eyes were hollow his mouth was open and drooling, his neck was twisted and his fingers were broken like a hydralic press crushed them. I was horrified when I saw it. I broke down in tears and remembered where’s mom? I stopped crying and tried to find my mom, but no luck. I looked all over the house and still could not find her. I looked outside the car was gone. Did mom leave the house when she saw him? I saw lights flashing outside, they were blue and red. They looked cool and I went outside to see what was happening.

&#x200B;

I saw police cars.

And I saw our car and it crashed and went into a ditch. I went up there and saw mom her neck was broken. before I could see anymore the police men backed me away from the crash when I turned around I saw the boogeyman.

he was dark, very dark. He had a wide grin and was at least 6,8 and he pointed at me, and it sounded like he was right in my ear. He said “I’ll see you later“ I gulped when I heard that. And he walked away in the forest and faded away. I lived with foster parents until I was 18 and I got a job and a house. I got a kid named jacob who is now 8 and a wife named Samantha I’m living a good life right now.

I still remember the exact words he said till this day.
