Leighton Goodall, a 24-year-old stoner and family man, worked a seemingly ordinary job at NASA. Every morning, he would kiss his wife Autumn and their daughter Aurora goodbye before heading off to work. Little did he know that his world was about to be turned upside down.

As Leighton clocked in, his supervisor pulled him aside. "Goodall, you're still on Project Pizza. That's top-secret shit, so keep it under wraps. Head down to the basement and get cracking."

Leighton nodded, making his way to the elevator. As he stepped inside, he noticed an old, mysterious red button. It seemed to call out to him, begging to be pushed. Against his better judgment, Leighton gave in to temptation and pressed it.

Suddenly, the elevator plummeted at breakneck speed. Leighton screamed as he was thrown against the ceiling, his head slamming into the metal. When the elevator finally jolted to a stop, he collapsed to the floor, dazed and disoriented.

The doors slid open, revealing a vast, underground facility. A sign read "SCP Foundation." Leighton stumbled out, his heart pounding in his chest.

Inside, a young security guard named Zack sat behind a desk, engrossed in a newspaper. He looked up, surprised to see Leighton. "Well, well, well. Looks like we've got a visitor from upstairs. What brings you to our neck of the woods?"

Leighton rubbed his aching head. "I think I made a wrong turn. Where the hell am I?"

Zack grinned, folding his newspaper. "You, my friend, have stumbled upon the SCP Foundation. We contain and study all sorts of weird and dangerous shit. I'll give you the grand tour."

As they walked through the facility, Leighton encountered a cast of eccentric characters. Dr. Bright, with a glint of madness in his eyes, greeted them. "Fresh meat! Try not to lose your mind down here. It's a fucking circus."

Dr. Clef, a man with a mischievous smirk, chimed in. "Keep your wits about you, kid. This place has a way of getting under your skin."

The stoic Dr. Gears barely acknowledged their presence, while the laid-back Dr. Iceberg offered a casual wave. "Take it easy, newbie. Just don't poke the wrong anomaly."

Zack led Leighton to a restricted area, his voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. "Check this out. We've got some friendly faces in here."

Inside, Leighton met the playful SCP-999, a tickle monster that filled the room with laughter. The helpful eye-pods, SCP-131, scurried around their feet. Paper dragons from SCP-1762 soared overhead, their whimsical presence a stark contrast to the facility's cold walls.

Leighton couldn't help but smile. "This is amazing, Zack. I never knew such incredible things existed."

Zack's expression darkened. "Oh, you haven't seen anything yet. Brace yourself for the heavy hitters."

He led Leighton to another containment area, the atmosphere growing oppressive. "In here, we keep the nastiest of the bunch. SCP-106, the Old Man. He'll phase through walls and drag you into his pocket dimension. And SCP-3000, the eel that fucks with your mind. It'll make you question your entire existence."

Leighton felt a chill run down his spine as Zack continued. "And then there's SCP-001. We don't even know what the fuck it is. All the proposals are bad news. Reality-benders, apocalypse-starters, you name it."

Suddenly, an ear-splitting alarm blared through the facility. Zack's face drained of color. "Fuck! I must have tripped the containment breach switch."

All hell broke loose as the SCPs poured out of their cells. Leighton watched in horror as SCP-106 emerged from a wall, its decaying face twisted in a grotesque smile. It reached out with a rotting hand, grabbing a nearby researcher and pulling them into its pocket dimension. Their screams echoed through the halls before being abruptly silence before seeing SCP-173, the concrete statue, materialized behind another researcher, snapping their neck with a sickening crunch. Blood sprayed across the walls as the body crumpled to the floor.

Zack grabbed Leighton's arm, his grip tight with fear. "We need to get the fuck out of here! Run!"

They sprinted down the corridors, dodging the chaos that engulfed the facility. SCP-049, the plague doctor, glided past them, its black robes billowing. It touched a guard, who immediately collapsed, convulsing as the life drained from their body.

Leighton's heart raced as they turned a corner, only to come face-to-face with SCP-096, the shy guy. Its face was contorted in rage, its mouth open in a silent scream. Zack shoved Leighton back. "Don't look at its face! That's how it gets you!"

They scrambled in the opposite direction, the sound of SCP-096's footsteps thundering behind them. Leighton risked a glance over his shoulder and saw the creature tearing apart a helpless scientist, its long arms ripping flesh from bone.

As they neared the elevator, a haunting melody filled the air. SCP-012, the cursed sheet music, had claimed another victim. A researcher sat hunched over a desk, frantically scribbling notes in their own blood, oblivious to the mayhem surrounding them.

Zack and Leighton burst into the elevator, slamming the button for the surface. As the doors began to close, a tentacle wrapped around Zack's leg, yanking him back. Leighton grabbed his hand, but SCP-3000's grip was too strong. Zack's fingers slipped from Leighton's grasp, and he disappeared into the writhing mass of the eel's body.

Leighton collapsed against the elevator wall, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Tears streamed down his face as the reality of what he had just witnessed sank in. The doors opened, and he stumbled back into the NASA basement, his mind reeling.

He made his way to his supervisor's office, his voice trembling. "Sir, there's been a breach. Zack... he didn't make it. The SCPs... they're out of control."

His supervisor looked up, confusion etched on his face. "Zack? SCPs? What the hell are you talking about, Goodall? You've been down in the basement all day working on Project Pizza. Are you high again?"

Leighton's blood ran cold. Was it all a hallucination? A drug-induced nightmare? He looked down at his hands, expecting to see blood, but they were clean.

He mumbled an apology and returned to his desk, his mind still trapped in the horrors he had experienced. As he tried to focus on his work, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

Days turned into weeks, and Leighton's paranoia grew. He jumped at every shadow, every unexpected noise. His relationship with Autumn and Aurora suffered as he withdrew into himself, consumed by the memories of the SCP Foundation.

One evening, as he lay in bed beside his wife, a sudden realization struck him. Project Pizza... P-I-Z-Z-A... Paranormal Investigation Zone: Zealously Anomalous. The pieces fell into place, and Leighton knew that his nightmare had been real.

He bolted upright, his heart pounding. He had to warn someone, anyone, about the dangers that lurked beneath the surface. But who would believe him? He was just a lowly NASA employee, a stoner with a wild imagination.

As he struggled with the weight of his knowledge, a flicker of movement caught his eye. There, in the corner of his bedroom, stood a figure cloaked in black, its face hidden beneath a hood. Leighton blinked, and it was gone.

He sank back onto his pillow, a sense of dread washing over him. The SCP Foundation had claimed him, and there was no escape. He closed his eyes, praying for a dreamless sleep, but knowing that the nightmares would never end.
