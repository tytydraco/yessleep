John walked into the long, white building. He could feel the butterflies in his stomach. It was the 17th of May 2004. Earlier that month, he had received a letter from the government to try some new drugs. John would get 1 million dollars for every pill he ate, but he had been warned that there was one drug that could potentially kill him. He felt his black hair and stopped to look at the map of the building. He found the room he was looking for and turned into a corridor to the left. Anticipation was gnawing at his stomach again. Finally, he got to the room he had been looking for. He slowly opened the door and crept into the dark room.

Lights turned on instantly. Standing in the middle of the room was a short, bald doctor with a hooked nose. "Welcome," he sneered. "As you know, you have been selected to try some new drugs. One of them can potentially kill you, but the rest will not," he said quietly.

"Alright," John said nervously. "I get 1 million dollars for every pill tested, right?"

"That is correct," the doctor said. "Let's begin."

A table rose out of the ground, and on it was a jar with around 1,000 pills inside. The strange-looking doctor immediately left the room. John was starting to wonder if this was such a good idea. But there was no turning back now. He opened the lid of the jar, which came off with some difficulty. He picked up the first pill and quickly popped it into his mouth.

It tingled slightly as he swallowed it, and he felt no immediate effects. He clenched his fists and reached for the next pill. He carefully picked it up, took a long, hard look at it, then put it in his mouth and swallowed it. After a while, he stopped looking at the pills before eating them, although he wasn’t guzzling them all down. His stomach felt stuffed, and he began to feel tired. John wondered if he should stop, but the thought of the money quickly put that out of his mind. He started to think less and less. Soon, his head began to droop. Just... one... more, he thought to himself.

But then a thought struck John. Why was he even feeling tired? This wasn’t the usual "I want to go to bed" tired. This was a brain-numbing tiredness. His eyes widened. The pills. There was only one deadly one, but you don’t die in a coma. They can keep you alive long enough to do whatever sick medical experiments they need to. He needed to stop taking the pills and stay awake. But deep down, he knew it was too late. He was going to fall asleep soon. He had to do something now! If you died because of the pill, your body would be unharmed, so they could still carry out some experiments with it. It was better if the body was in a coma, though—that's why the majority of pills were coma-inducing ones.

John thought about it for a moment. There was only one way. He would cut his arms and legs off, then slit his throat. The government was corrupt, and he had to do this to save other lives. With grim determination, he emptied the jar of its contents and smashed it against the ground. It broke into a few razor-sharp pieces. He picked up the biggest, sharpest one and slammed it against his bicep. Blood spurted out. He cut it again and again. The pain was unbearable. Finally, his arm fell off. Then he did the same with both legs. But there was one thing he had overlooked—he still had his right arm left. He knew he couldn’t cut his arm off while holding the glass shard in his teeth. The next best thing was his fingers. He took the glass piece in his teeth and cut his fingers off. One by one, they dropped to the floor.

Then he realized he couldn’t kill himself now. He laughed out loud. He flopped to the floor. He let out a slow, pained sigh.

Suddenly, the world around him faded to bright light. He couldn’t see anything for a few seconds. Then a different world came into focus.

He was in a hospital bed. He looked around and saw a sign. It was too far away to read what it said.

"Welcome to Woomera Hospital," a female voice said somewhere to the right.

John groaned.

"We found you passed out next to a government building," she continued.

John turned to her.

**"No injuries, of course,"** she said with a smile.

He turned away, confused. John looked out of the window on his left. Then he saw him.

The doctor, holding a piece of sharp, blood-stained glass.
