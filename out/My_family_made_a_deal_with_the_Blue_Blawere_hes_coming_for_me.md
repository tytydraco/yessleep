“You possess the gift too y’know.” The "spiritual" lady, dressed in her off the shoulder flowy lilac top, said to me. She shuffled tarot cards between her wrinkled hands, her plasticky nails flashing bright pink as the cards flowed from one hand into the other.

“Uh huh.” I agreed sarcastically, nudging my cousin Whitney. She snort-laughed and took another swig from her blue WKD.

My Grandad thought it would be a good idea to have a psychic night at our pub, everyone else thought it was stupid. I was about sixteen at the time and until recently hadn’t thought about that psychic lady for years. I’ve never really believed in that sort of thing. I see it as taking money off of vulnerable people. But I have always believed in the supernatural and the otherworldly.

[Due to recent events](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ld1zy7/i_inherited_my_grandads_pub_but_i_cant_bring/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I can no longer doubt the existence of monsters unless I doubt my own senses. My senses may have been mildly affected by a certain substance that isn’t yet legal in the UK. But I know what I saw. Even if I didn't know for certain, my cousin Whitney saw it too. I now know that what we saw has a name. The sea creature much older than the pub, who may even be older than the town itself, was dubbed the Blue Blawere by my ancestors.

If you’ve taken a look at Whitney’s posts you’ll understand why we’re currently hiding in the shitty part of suburban London where my junkie Uncle Charlie lives. Huddled on the peeling leather sofa in his tiny council flat, I’m taking stock of everything that happened and trying to piece some bits together. Whitney is curled up on one end with the big leather bound book in her lap that supposedly contains a record of all the family members that my ancestors left down in the tunnels for the Blue Blawere.

“What it doesn’t tell me is why?” She lamented. “It’s just a list of names.”

“I’m sure your dad and Auntie Tanya will have answers.” The two of them had left us to go and get provisions. A silence passed between us, only interrupted by the sound of Whitney turning pages when I finally sound the gumption to say;

“Y’know what I’m worried about.”

“What?” She responded without looking up from the book.

“Who else is gonna die now that we’ve left. You were supposed to be the sacrifice. It’s going to be hungry…We’ve got little cousins. Tanya’s kids. My siblings.”

Still avoiding eye contact, she shuffled in her seat and sat up straight. “I think the monster chooses who he wants. I don’t think we get to choose. Clearly he didn’t want our little cousins.”

“How do you know that?” I asked.

“Just a hunch.” She shrugged.

Whitney doesn’t have hunches. She’s the least intuitive person I know other than when the Blue Blawere was messing with her head. In fact she often goes against what should be a natural survival instinct. Not that she isn’t brave. I envy that. Not to say I don’t have my moments. I’d say facing off against my six foot father was quite brave. But for her it's her natural state of being. For me bravery was a bit of a foreign concept until recently.

Something clicked for me as I watched my father stab Whitney in the neck with a needle. His own niece. I watched in horror as her eyes closed and her body went limp. When I opened my mouth to yell, getting a surge of what felt like bravery, I felt something get me in the neck too. The pain reminded me of a wasp sting, but deeper. The substance I had been injected with forced me into a deep black dreamless sleep.

When my eyes opened again I was staring up at my grandad’s second wife. A thin and glamorous older woman who always had perfectly styled hair. I never liked grandad’s second wife Nicole Reed. If you‘ve watched only fools and horses, she reminds me of Del Boy’s evil ex fiancée Pauline. She’s my auntie Tanya’s mum, but they couldn’t be more different. I don’t think my grandad ever loved Nicole and I don’t think she cared much for him either. I suppose their marriage came out because my grandfather was lonely after the divorce from my nan. But I’ve never been sure what she got out of their marriage, a bit of money maybe?

As Nicole stood over me, watching me wake up, her face was twisted in a smug half smile. I sat up abruptly and crawled away from her on the cold cellar floor. She rolled her eyes and followed me.

“Mike. I have no interest in hurting you, I just want you to listen to me.” I hated that tone. She had the most insufferable telling off voice any nan could have, whiny, shrill and condescending.

“Where’s my dad?” I asked, ignoring what she’d said before.

“That’s not important. You and I need to have a chat.”

“What did you do with Whitney?”

“I’m getting to that Michael.” She snapped.

Curiously, I watched her take a large leather bound book off the top of the whirring ice machine. She sat down on a chair, crossed her legs and opened the tome. As she opened it I noticed a large ornate letter M on the front cover. I looked around in case someone else was down there with us, witnessing what the hell was going on, but no, it was just me and my creepy step grandmother. Who was about to read me a story apparently. Nicole sat up straight, cleared her throat then began to read:

“The Blue Blawere is big and blithe,

He dwells in wet dark where you can dive,

He asks but one thing of you and I,

For one of you must come and die.”

Then she turned to me. I have no idea what she expected. Applause? A nod of appreciation for her stunning performance. I stared at her blanky until I asked. “W-what's a Blawere?”

“Oh I think you’ve seen him. You and your little trouble making cousin found him all by yourselves.” She placed the book back on top of the ice machine and stood up. “I never liked Whitney, she’s always been a brat. Like when she stole that ring your grandfather gave me.”

“That was great nanny Bea’s ring.” I corrected her. “What’s going on here anyway?”

“Right.” She sighed, clearly annoyed that she had to explain something to me. “See Micheal, usually the majority of the family is spared the tragedy of knowing one of you was murdered by an ancient sea beast. But your cousin seems to refuse to call to sacrifice. Because of course she does. Either that or we were wrong and the Blawere doesn’t want her after all. Which makes no sense because he prefers young women and the sign he sent us pointed to her. He’s never refused an offering before.” She looked around the cellar with her hand on her chin.

I stared at her wide eyed and deeply confused. “Is Whitney…” I looked over at the old wooden door. Nicole nodded with a wolfish grin.

In this situation, my cousin would’ve jumped up and started swinging for Nicole, demanding to know where the key was. Then she’d go running into the tunnels looking for me. But I decided to handle things differently.

“Why her and not me?” I asked, buying time as I looked around the cellar for a weapon.

Nicole shrugged. “That’s just who he wanted.”

“Is there not a way that you can decide? Like an old ritual or something?”

“No. We suppose he just picks whoever is most expendable out of the younger members of the family.”

“Whitney isn’t expendable.”

Nicole laughed. “It’s too late to try and make me feel sorry for her now, she’s probably already dead. And if that’s the case we can put this whole thing behind us and not think about it for another century.”

“When did you get so evil?”

“I’m not evil Michael, I'm protecting my village. It’s a basic utilitarian concept, we sacrifice one of our own and in return the Blue Blawere leaves us alone until he needs to feed again.”

“And who decided this? Have we ever tried anything different? Have we ever tried to kill it?”

Despite believing in it to an extent, I have always been a sceptic of the supernatural up until seeing the Blue Blawere with my own eyes. But now I felt as if I could believe in anything. My understanding of the world had been shattered but now it felt as if the pieces were starting to come back together, just in a new way. I remembered what the psychic had said to me all those years ago.

I could feel something. I know that sounds silly because of course you can always feel something, the ground beneath you, the clothes on your skin, the wind in your hair. But I could feel something in the ground, in the air, like an emotion or a feeling. A sign. Tension. A disturbance in the force. Spidey sense. Something. An event was about to happen. The feeling emanated from above me. I looked up through the middle of the swirling spiral staircase’s banister.

Suddenly, I rolled out of the way. A huge black book came soaring down from the top of the stairs. It smacked into my step grandmother’s head. Then it bounced and landed on the floor with a thud landing front cover side up. “Family photo album” it read.

Two energies stirred from the loud bang, my aunt Tanya from upstairs who was afraid, determined and a little confused. And my father in my grandad's office. He was scared but it was wrapped in deep hot anger.

Nicole swayed, putting her hand to the wound on her head before she toppled over. Like a rag doll she crumpled onto the stone floor. I heard Tanya run down the stairs in a series of rushed pattering footsteps. Scrambling to my feet, I jumped up, knowing my dad was going to jump out and grab her if I didn't get there first. Hurriedly, I ran up the cellar steps. I saw my dad opening the door to the hallway. He stared at me in stunned surprise and I took advantage of his confusion. I sent my fist into his cheek, which made a sickening crunch sound as it fractured beneath my fist.

Tanya, who had reached the bottom of the stairs, gasped and took a few steps back. My father locked eyes with me and this time he was full of blind rage. He returned my punch, getting me in the eye, before he grabbed a hold of me and slammed me against the wall.

“What do you think you’re doing?!” He yelled. I hated it when he yelled. It sent me back to when I was a kid and I’d wake up in the middle of night screaming. And he’d yell and yell about me waking him up. He’d always yell about anything I did. I wonder if he just liked yelling.

“Where’s the key?” I asked him calmly. My composure only irritated him further. I inherited that from my mother. A trait he despised.

“Doesn't matter because you aren’t getting it.” He grinned.

I decided to keep stalling him. I saw Tanya slink behind us and dip into the office.

“Why not?” I asked, feigning disappointment. Tanya began rummaging around as silently as she could.

He sighed and rolled his eyes. “When will you understand that I only ever do things for your own good.”

“Like what?” I goaded.

“Like sacrificing my life to put a roof over your head. To keep you fed and housed.”

“Oh so the basic things you need to live as a human being. Thanks Kevin you’re father of the year!”

“Sarcastic little cunt!” His voice boomed. He slammed me against the wall again, my back hurt after the blow and it winded me. “You’d be the one down in those tunnels if I hadn’t fought tooth and nail for you!”

Tanya showed me the key before she slipped it into her pocket.

I launched my forehead into my fathers nose. There was another crunch. His grip loosened and he groaned in pain. I wriggled free, dashing away down the hallway as quickly as I could. He caught me and a wrestle ensued between us. Desperately he was trying to drag me away from the stairs as I was trying to throw him down them.

“Y’know you might be the shittest excuse for a son out there. I don’t even think you’re mine.” He said as he held my head over the edge of the banister, his thick fingers squeezing into my face. “Wouldn’t put it past your mother.”

It was that comment that sent me over the edge. Well, it sent my father over the edge really I should say. I used all my adrenaline, and a bit of spite, to hoist myself up and fling him down the staircase. Rolling, he bumped down the stairs like something out of a slapstick comedy. His roll ended with a thump on the cellar floor. I looked down at him from the banister, as he laid beside Nicole, both of them slowly bleeding out.

Tanya put her shaking hand on my shoulder as we both looked at our comatose parents. Then I watched her go downstairs and grab the leather book with the M.

“Come on kid.” She smiled at me as she reached the top of the stairs. It looked like she’d had some kind of tussle herself. Her hair had specks of blood matted in it.

“What happened to you?” I asked.

“They tied me up upstairs. After I tried to stop them taking Whitney down there. They decided it was best if I stayed away until it was done.”

“You okay?”

“Oh yeah. This blood isn’t mine.” She smiled. Bit of a dark horse is our auntie Tanya.

“I need to go to the beach.” I told her. “You stay here in case she comes back this way.”

“I need to stay here anyway. Charlie’s coming.”

“Seriously?”

“He’s all we’ve got left.” She shrugged.

“Fine. Whatever. I’ll ring you when I find Whitney.” I felt around in my pocket for my phone and my knife.

“Oh sorry I took your pocket knife. I gave it to Whitney. I slid it in her pocket, in case she needed it.”

“Good thinking.” I went to turn to leave when I suddenly remembered something. “Have we got any rope?”

“Yes. In the storage cupboard in the garden.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.” We gave each other a quick hug before I ran out of the pub and out into the garden. After fumbling around and knocking countless tools and pots of paint onto the floor of the shed, I grabbed the rope and raced off to the seafront.

Heart thudding, I paced back and forth along the sand, my eyes darting toward any possible sign of movement on the water. I texted Tanya here and there just to feel like I was doing something. It felt like too much time had passed. The tide was beginning to go out and I was starting to lose hope. Just as I felt a panicked tear fall from my eye, I saw movement in the water. In the moonlight I saw the water fizz and bubble, caused by Whitney and the monster splashing and thrashing around. Whitney’s face broke the surface. I gasped with relief as she gasped for air. Then suddenly she was pulled under again. My heart sank.

Frantically, I picked up my rope with the weight on the end of it and swung it. I just had to hope it would land where Whitney could reach. I sent the weight hurtling across the water.

The weight on the end of the rope splashed onto the surface, as far as I could throw it. I waited with baited breath to feel Whitney pull on it. I couldn’t blink as I waited. Once again it felt like too much time had passed. I saw her in my mind’s eye slowly drifting down into the depths of the sea, fading into the dark water. Fuck, I thought, fuck fuck fuck, I threw it in the wrong place. I could feel her fading, the life draining from her. I started pulling off my shoes ready to go diving in after her when by some miracle her head broke through the surface again gasping for breath. I heard myself cheer and I grabbed the rope. Excitedly, I pulled her to shore. Once she was within arms reach I ran into the water. She pulled herself onto her staggering feet, and once she was in front me, she pulled me into an embrace and clung to me. She coated my clothes in freezing salty sea water but I was too happy to care. I helped her onto the sand, took stock of her injuries then hauled into my Uncle Charlie’s stinky car.

And now, the reward for our ordeal is my uncle’s flat, with its peeling wall paper and the lack of décor and furniture. I always thought defeating a monster came with better rewards than this. I looked over at Whitney again as she read through the old book. I wasn’t satisfied with Whitney’s “Just a haunch” answer, I could tell she had more to say.

“There’s something you’re not telling me.” I said to her. Finally, she looked up from the book and looked at me nervously.

“Well. It’s not a nice thing to hear.”

“Tell me.”

She inhaled, put the book on the sofa’s arm rest and then began; “When I was in the manor house, and the monster followed me. He started repeating a conversation between our dads. It was some argument about whether it was you or me that was going to end up being fed to the monster. They both didn’t want us going down there. But my dad said something like ‘send the weird one down’” She admitted, hanging her face in shame that she’d kept it from me.

Awkwardly, I laughed but in truth what she told me frightened me to my core. Uncle Charlie is an irrational, inconsistent and impulsive man. Who’s to say he won’t try to feed me to the Blue Blawere again. He would see an act like that as proof he loves Whitney, which is something she will never believe because ultimately he doesn’t. He’s a bit like my dad, he likes the idea of being a father but doesn’t enjoy fatherhood in practice.

Unfortunately, I know we have to go back. It horrifies me but I know we have no choice. I know the Blue Blawere is still alive. Injured and retreating, but still alive. I have this awful sickening gut feeling that until he has me, and I can feel it in my bones that it’s me that he’s wanted all along, he’ll keep eating innocent people. I must admit, my step grandmother was right, it is a basic utilitarian concept. We’d have peace for a hundred years if I sacrificed myself.

The final line of the poem won’t leave my mind. I hear it over and over again. It keeps me up at night. It repeats on loop like an instruction over a tannoy or a song, a mantra in my head. The words make me come out in goosebumps and I know whichever ancestor wrote them, wrote them for me, penned them with the knowledge it was something a successor needed to hear.

“For one of you must come and die.”
