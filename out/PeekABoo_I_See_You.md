I found several boxes of journals, notes, and other writings; all different authors with seemingly real stories or recollections.

Here’s one I transcribed to share with you all.

Peek-A-Boo, I See You.

My eyes slowly opened; the soft and slightly sticky warmth of my modest 1-bedroom apartment hung like a an oppressive reminder that I, as an unemployed and nearly-penniless tenant, couldn’t afford to turn on my A/C. 

I had fallen asleep in a slump against the old brown leather couch in the living room.  

Again. 

I groaned as my body shifted into place, stretching my legs and arms out feeling them wake up as I did.

July in Georgia was NOT forgiving, and it certainly took no prisoners. 

The hours I had whittled away I spent largely just laying around, hoping my email notification would go off regarding a potential job offer. This cycle had been ongoing for about a week..or two…and honestly, made time seem even more warped. 

My mind berated me: Was I doing enough? Should I be burning through my very-nearly nonexistent savings like this? I shouldn’t be picky, I should just go get whatever job I can…beggars can’t be choosers y’know…

Attempting to shake off the mental fog, I got up quickly from the couch, walked over the mini fridge against the adjacent wall and took out an ice-cold soda. Placing the cold can against my head I sighed, having momentary relief and trying to reassure myself that I was making the right decision. I deserve the RIGHT job. I have the experience. I have the skill set. I shouldn’t settle. One of these opportunities will pan out…I know it.

Feeling a renewed sense of vigor, I turned to my phone, charging on the table that sat beside the couch. I nabbed it up and looked as the screen to see the time, 4:37pm, and nothing else but my screen saver - some generic mountain range captured at dusk that always made me feel nostalgic for a place I’d never been. 

I let out another sigh, glanced around my sparse and warm living quarters and thought about how to kill the rest of the day. 

That’s when I heard it. Outside my apartment window. A lady’s voice, fairly young. Exuberant. Happy. But…slightly wrong. 

She spoke, “I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!” 

It sounded like she was talking to kid, maybe an even a baby. I was half tempted to pull back the curtain and scan the lawn to see, but I thought, if she was there and some weird dude starts staring at her…well, that’d be awkward. 

I’m not overly familiar with my neighbors in the apartments across the way. But I’d never seen a kid or baby, and I’d never heard a voice like this before. 

To a normal person, you’d think “why is a lady talking to a baby weird?” - and you know, I’d agree with you. But, I’d spent too much time indoors with naught but my own mind to keep me company. And I’m sure you can guess that leads to heightened anxiety.

“Christopher, get a-fuckin-hold of yourself dude” - “you’ve spent too many days sitting in this apartment moping around that now some lady talking to a baby has you freaked out” - 

I let out a chuckle at myself for being so stupid. 

What a dumbass…

I cracked the soda open and took big gulp, letting the carbonation and sugar simultaneously burn and soothe my throat. 

I let a hearty and likely-annoying “AHHHHH” afterwards, and to my own amusement.

I finished the soda in another two gulps, walked over the trash can situated near the sink and chucked it in. 

Walking back into the living room, I noticed there was no longer any game of peek-a-boo being cooed outside my window and all had returned to its normal and uninteresting silence. 

With this, I turned my attention back to the phone, deciding I would manually check my emails. Sometimes notifications don’t always works as intended and I was desperate for some sign of forward momentum.

As I placed my finger over the “email” icon on my home screen the exuberant, joyful and even more warped voice rang out again.

“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!” 

This time it wasn’t coming from behind me, beyond the curtained window. It was coming from my porch; right behind my front door.

I stared in confusion in its direction. 

“What in fuck” - I could feel anxiety anxious energy surge through my body. My mind wasn’t sure how to process the voice or what was happening -

Why is the voice at my door? Why does it sound like that? 

I tried to quickly rationalize it; uh…maybe she’s waiting for her friend across the way, the uh…Carrollwoods I think? Maybe she’s friends or family, and it’s hot and she’s got her baby and is trying to keep him calm or entertained? 

My brain was rooting around trying to red-yarn its way to some conclusion that made that voice - that was now just passed my front door - less out of place; less…strange.

“Get your act together..” 

Then it hit me. 

I’m dramatizing a situation because I’m bored and not being productive. 

Of course.

Duh.

I chuckled again at my own stupidity.

I’m going to go to my room and watch TV. 
The fan blows better in there anyways; and I’ll be away from this lady’s annoying blabbering. I’m not scared, I’m just annoyed. 

I lied to make myself feel less like a wuss who was evading a strange scenario, and more like someone who was choosing to avoid an obnoxious situation.

I sat up and quickly walked down the hall. The lady’s discordant, joyful and robotic “I see you!” fading.

Upon entering my modest room - which housed a bed, a sofa chair, a small closest and smaller bathroom, I shut the door and, out some animal-borne sense of security - locked it.

I plopped down in the sofa chair and quickly booted up my TV and launched Netflix. 

I was paranoid about nothing. I knew that. But, stranger things have happened, and I wasn’t going to assume I was safe. 

Despite not being able to hear the lady any longer, I cranked the volume over my usual listening threshold. I sat back and began to watch a documentary on Panda preservation.

Before I knew it my eyes had grown heavy and my body and mind had given themselves over to sleep yet again. 

Some time later I jolted awake. the room dark and TV off due to its power-save settings. 

What had woken me was the soft pulsating of the phone in my hand vibrating.

The caller-ID read “Mom”.

I stared at it - half out of grogginess and half out of cowardice. “Do I want to talk to her?” or, as it usually goes with my mother, “be talked at” by her.

I decided against answering. I was already feeling annoyed at myself enough, I didn’t need a good ol’ dogpiling from my mother to top it off.

Plus, I had to pee. God did I have to pee.

I got up, and hustled the few short steps into the connected bathroom. Flicked on the light, and as I was about unbuckle my pants, from past the door to my bedroom came THAT voice. The lady’s voice. Joyful, sweet, energetic. LOUD. And very very WRONG. 

“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo!” “I see you!”

There was no denying it now. This voice sounded human, but it wasn’t. It was slightly warped. As if the edges of it were bending, warping. As if the mouth forming them was too misshapen to form them right; as if the voice projecting them was doing its best to mock it. 

My mind raced; this seemed unbelievable. What in absolute fuck was less than 3 feet away, inside my apartment, WHY was it doing this to me?

I blinked hard and gathered what little resolve I had - it didn’t matter what or why this was happening. It just was. And I could safely conclude that, whatever it was, it was intending to scare or - worse - hurt me.

I had my phone. I could call 9-1-1. That was step one. 

Step two, I had a baseball bat in my closet. I could grab that and ready myself. 

Step three, I had small window that dropped down into the courtyard. I was on the second floor, but I could manage the jump. I think.

That’s all I could think to do.

With all the bluster and bravado I could muster, I quickly moved to the sofa chair, grabbed my phone and made to my open closest grabbing the bat, all in a few swift movements. All the while the “Lady” was cooing the same phrase over and over again, on a loop, not more than 5 feet away.

I wrestled with the lock on my bedroom window. It wasn’t playing nice. I don’t think I’d ever opened it in the 4 years I’d lived here and it obviously hadn’t been opened long before then. 

After struggling with the latch for what felt like an eternity, it gave way and I then proceeded to press up on the window. Luckily it went flying up without much resistance, and as I pushed it up it made a hard slamming sound.

And as if on cue, when that happened, the “Lady” outside the door chanting stopped on a dime.

It was dead silent. The only discernible sound was my breathing, the night air flowing in and bringing with it the sounds crickets and cicadas.

I sat by the open window, wide-eyed. Staring directly into the dinky lit room and laser-focused on the bedroom door.

From underneath the door frame an impossibly long arm silently began to stretch up. Skin pale, almost blue in the light. Vascular. The fingers, long, boney and dressed in rings against their bulging knuckles. The fingernails longer still and adorned in a crimson polish that almost seemed to glow in the drearily lit bedroom.

The impossibly long arm effortlessly stretched until its index finger effortlessly touched the lock on the doorknob. And as if waiting just a beat to heighten the tension, it clicked the lock.

The door was now unlocked. This…”Lady” could swing the door open…and whatever it was could cross the threshold into the room and come for me.

I had to jump. The risk of breaking my legs be damned, I didn’t want to see what ghoulish visage that arm belonged too. 

I steeled my nerves and jumped the twelve or so feet to grass courtyard below. 

I landed with a hard thud, but not didn’t lose my balance.

My adrenaline rushing, I made a hasty dash toward the center of my small complex. My legs firing like pistons, I gunned it to nearest light source, which happened to be a small gazebo. 

Then my flight or fight response loosened enough for me to think: “I gotta call the fuckin’ cops!”

As I approached the small structure, which was bathed in a harsh and singular white light, I pivoted to look back at my apartment window. No hand. No creature. No…nothing. Just an open window.

But what would I expect to see? Some ghoulish haunt leering out at me from that darkened opening? Some unholy visage, all teeth and elongated appendages coaxing me back in? What was going on with me? Was I having some sort…breakdown? Had the stress and loneliness gotten to me? That was certainly a better explanation than what I was THINKING was happening…right?

I sighed, plopped down hard on the only bench housed under the gazebo and unlocked my phone.

I had a notification.

An email.

I knew, no matter, now wasn’t the time. I needed to call the cops. I needed to make sure my apartment was clear and if I was having a mental breakdown, I could get help. I needed this…whatever the fuck it was…to be over. 

But, you know that often unseen hand the guides us to make the most inane decisions at just the wrong moment? Yeah. That ONE. That force propelled me to click on the email notification.

God dammit, I wish I hadn’t.

It took me to a video. 

The video was dark, quiet. As if nothing was even playing…but then a loud static and the sound of hands fumbling around as the frame was jilted and shook.

And then, as if lit with a small and barely effectual flashlight, a mouth plastered with a wry grin appeared. But, as with the voice, it was wrong. It was too wide, with far too many small teeth. the lips were thin and smeared with crimson lipstick, the same shade as fingernails I’d seen just minutes ago.

Then it began to move; to talk. 

“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo” “I see you!”

I felt my body flush with fear; confusion; anger. WHAT. THE. FUCK. WAS. HAPPENING?!

I tried to exit out, I tried shutting my phones power off. Nothing was working.

I instinctively, and forcefully, dropped my phone. the mantra was on a disturbing repeat. The “Lady’s” joyous and warped voice a disgusting lullaby I HAD to get away from.

Whatever ungodly force had decided to visit me was breaking the bounds of any reality I understood. 

“Neighbors!” - my mind yelled at me. “ GO to the Carrolwood’s…ask to use their phone…call 9-1-1. Figure this shit out. GO!” 

I spurred myself into action, running out from beneath the gazebo and toward the other two story apartment complex that directly faced mine.

Navigating the dimly lit walkway up to their door, I didn’t have concern for etiquette or what time it was; I was in pure self-preservation mode.

I knocked on their door as loudly I could.

“Fuck…what’s the wife’s name? Denise? Desiree? Ahhh. Something with a D…” 

I simultaneously scolded myself whilst trying to recall the woman’s name. Her husband, who I had only met once in passing, was a complete unknown.

Before I could deliberate any further, a porch light popped on and a voice from behind the door wavered out at me.

It was a man - the aforementioned husband.

“Who…what the hell do you want?”

“I am so sorry to bother you Mr. Carrollwood…But someone broke into my house and I don’t have my cell and I’m worried and I need to call the cops.. I live across the way in unit 17 -“

He cut me off.

“Yeah, yeah. Christian, right?” He said, his tone less unsure and worried and now more curious and annoyed.

“Christopher.” I responded back hurriedly while throwing another glance at my apartment unit.

Another voice, quieter, came out from behind the door. A woman. 

“Christopher, honey, yes? You sound scared. Let’s get you some help”

Thank god. Buddha. Shiva. Elvis. Who-the-fuck-ever!

I sighed. I felt a wave of uncertain hope wash over me. 

The door unlatched and swung open to reveal a dark opening. 

One that seemed stretch in a void….

There was no one there. 

No Mr. Carrollwood.

No Ms. Carrollwood.

Just a dark hallway and a voice that loudly reached from just beyond its bounds.

“I see you!” “Peek-a-boo” “I see you…CHRISTOPHER”

As quickly as I had felt hope, I felt my body give itself over to absolute terror.

I spun around and attempted to run, but that long, pale-blue arm. The one with its nail’s adorned in a bright, glowing crimson polish had wrapped its unnatural fingers all the way around my calf.

I fell hard on the “We’re Glad You’re Here!” Welcome mat that decorated the front porch of the Carrollwood’s.

I managed to turn my body around to see that the arm was pulling me into the void. I couldn’t see the creature it was attached too, and I didn’t want too. I need to fight. I get loose.

But I was being dragged by a force so strong, any attempt I made to swing my bat or kick was met with pure indifference.

“Holy shit! This is it” my mind raced. My heart thrashed inside my chest so hard, I felt like I’d have a heart attack, or worse, die of fear.

I swung the bat. I yelled. I cursed.

It was no use. I was being drawn into the maw of this entity, this being. This…THING.  

I had shut my eyes and waited. Waited to die. 

I stopped moving. 

I didn’t feel the hand upon my leg anymore. 

I felt warm. 

I jolted awake. 

I was in my apartment. The sticky-heaviness of the room just as it had been hours before.

The golden light from the afternoon poured in through what cracks it could.

“What the fuck” I thought. “Did…I just dream that shit?”

As I straightened my stiff and slightly achey body up - and coming to grips with absolute deja vu - a voice rang out from down the hall. This time, slow; loud; and just passed the threshold of my sight.

“PEEK-A-BOO….I. SEE. YOU.”
