I apologize for my absence. Need I say more than having a new baby is so hard? Help is hard to come by, especially when the father is no longer in the picture. He decided the responsibility of fatherhood was too much and threw himself off of a bridge; no matter. Control is one of the few things we don’t have over these types of situations. Me, I’m settling into motherhood just fine. 

He’s asleep now, for the first time since he was brought into our home. When He’s Awake, he’s such a handful. i’ve tried everything. Puppets, lullabies, television, and he’s just so restless. Me and him have had a hard time setting bedtime boundaries. 

He Reads too. My Mind was so full of nothing at that age, he truly is a wonder and a blessing. I have to review what we read together. Carefully, of course; he wants to Write eventually. This is something that as a mother, I will always support; he wants it. I Need it for him, because I am his mother. 

Police came and went after that horrible day, he sat on my hip and assured me that everything would be okay. Called his dad crazy. Kill yourself just because you don’t want to be a dad? The Child is the best thing you could ever have in life, Save having an absolute genius for a kid. Me and him are about as close knit as a mom and kid ever could be. 

Anyway, it sounds like he’s getting up. Helping their child is something a mother must do. Please be afraid to comment on this post, as I am sure he will read it over. I Am assuring you here and now, he is perfect. In other words, I am safe. Danger is not in this home, promise!

He asked me to add some things before I send this update. Please be aware the following information is not part of the above message. First, he asked me to name him. I decided on Ky, because that is my middle name and would’ve been my name if I was a boy. 

Because of him, I have reconciled with my mom. He loves hearing me talk to her. He tells me what questions to ask her, and for the first time in ten years, I talked to my mom for *hours.* He says that family is so important, and that we can’t afford to lose another just because they don’t understand his gifts. 

Like I mentioned before, he doesn’t need more than a few minutes of sleep every few days. Imagine all of the time he will have in adulthood to explore his hobbies! He’s already got me into doing yoga at the local mom’s center. 

He never leaves my hip, it’s almost like he’s attached! Even when I try to put him down, he holds on for dear life. He’s got an incredibly strong grip for a baby, and an incredibly strong mind as well. I am so proud of all of his accomplishments already. He and I will live a perfect life together. He will never abandon me like I did my own mom, and he will make sure that I do not ever abandon her again. In fact, he suggested we sell my townhome and move in with her. I thought that was a wonderful idea. Being a single mom is so hard. But his deep, hearty laugh makes it all worth it. 

Trying to work on the computer with a baby on your hip is just so hard. I quit my job so that I could always be there and give him the attention he deserves. He suggested this too, especially since I have such great savings. He says when he gets big and stronger, I can go back to work. He just has to make sure I’ll be a good mom even when he’s away.

He eats so, so much. It’s hard to keep up. Truly, between the amount he drains from me and the four gallons of milk I have gone through since he came home, I am amazed at his stomach capacity. He’s already got two teeth showing too, but they're molars. I always thought that the front set came in first. But, at least he can eat solid food. He loves meat, especially pork. He says it tastes like the inside of my tummy. How cute that he remembers that. 

He also remembers how bad I didn’t want to be a mom, and how hard I tried to get rid of him. It makes him very sad. If you’re thinking about having an abortion because you think you don’t want kids, let me tell you firsthand how much I love mine. He is my anchor to a better life. 

And wow, has he grown. I mean, I’ve had this kid for less than a week and he’s already ten pounds heavier and literally growing by the minute. And he’s starting to talk out loud too. He said his first word today - mama (of course). He says that by tomorrow, he thinks he will be able to stand up on his own. By the end of next week, he could be running. I told him he should be an athlete when he grows up, but he said that would take too much time away from family life. I assured him that I would come to all of his games, and he said he knew I would and that he wouldn’t have it any other way. 

Oh! One last thing, he’s so excited about this: I am trying for another baby! He said he wanted a little sibling, and even though I thought that one baby was already so much to handle, he convinced me otherwise. I have a consultation with a doctor at a sperm clinic next week. He helped me do all the research, and is dead set on finding someone who looks just like his dad.
