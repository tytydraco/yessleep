It’s cold in Hollow’s Point.

That’s the first thing they tell you, displayed proudly on the ‘Welcome’ sign you see when you pass it on the highway. It’s an accurate description; even in the summers, it rarely cracks 70 degrees. Befitting of a town named after a type of bullet, I always thought. Of course, Hollow’s Point is actually named for its founder, James P. Hollow, who happened to be an avid hunter. Funny how history works out like that sometimes.

I moved to Hollow’s Point when I was fourteen, and I was less than pleased. My dad had gotten a management job at the local lodge, which boomed during the winter months, packed with rich out-of-towners who came to ski at the nearby mountain. While I was admittedly excited at the prospect of learning how to snowboard, the idea of moving from a suburb in Arizona to a resort town in the Pacific Northwest that could be driven through in less than 15 minutes was not an appealing one.

Still, my mom promised my brothers and I that the move would be temporary, just until my dad could find a better job. I learned later that we had lost the house in Arizona, a consequence of the 2008 recession that had cost both of my parents their jobs and stable income, but at the time I didn’t know any better. I won’t lie and say I didn’t harbor resentment toward them; after all, all my friends were still back in Arizona, eager to start high school. But there was nothing to be done about it, and we all piled into my parents’ creaky but reliable 2001 Suburban and began the arduous drive up.

Ellen was the first kid my age I met at Hollow’s Point. She was sitting in the lobby of Kettleman Lodge, my dad’s new place of employment, leafing through a worn copy of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*. One of the perks of the job was that we got to live in a small community of houses right next to the lodge, so we had come by to pick up the keys to the new place and so my dad could officially meet his new bosses.

My mom, with a little too much enthusiasm, had practically shoved me in her direction with a directive of “go make friends,” which I begrudgingly obeyed.

“Um, hi.”

Ellen startled, gasping as she quickly slammed the book shut and stared up at me. “Oh. H-hi?”

“Sorry for scaring you,” I said, “Uh, my name’s Amber. My family just moved here.”

“Oh, okay. I’m Ellen,” she tucked her book into her jacket, looking around as if to see if anyone was watching, “It’s nice to meet you.”

“I like Harry Potter too.”

“You do?” she asked excitedly, before her face fell and she once again glanced around.

“What’s wrong?”

“Um, my dad works here. He doesn’t like me reading those books, he says…” Ellen trailed off, tucked a lock of sandy blonde hair behind her ear.

“Says what?” I sat down on the leather couch beside her, more than a little intrigued.

“He says they’re…” she leaned in and whispered the next part, “Satanic. He thinks they encourage devil worship.”

“Oh.” I wrinkled my nose. “But they’re just about wizards?”

Ellen shrugged. She reached up and fiddled with her necklace, a shiny gold cross on a thin chain.

“Well, who’s your favorite character?”

“...I like Hermione.” She offered a shy smile, which I returned with a wide grin.

“Me too! She and Harry are my favorites.”

Ellen and I became fast friends. We were the right age— not quite as simple as making friends in early adolescence, but still young enough that the commonality of liking a book series was enough of a basis for a lasting friendship. She was a shy girl, but eventually my persistence (my mom had always described me as a dogged extrovert) won her over and she began to open up more, to laugh louder, to not hide under the covers when we watched PG-13 movies. She lived in the house a few doors down from me, and we would often have sleepovers. Always at my place, though; I never saw the inside of Ellen’s house until that fateful day in October.

We attended Beecher High School, a public school that the children in our town and the next one over, Farroway, attended. Hollow’s Point, and Farroway too, were the kind of places where everyone knew everyone, something I had had to fast get accustomed to when the clerk at our local grocery store asked me why I had gotten detention last week. Nothing crazy ever really happened in Hollow’s Point, especially not when the tourists were around.

So, when the announcement rang out over the loudspeakers— *“School has been dismissed for the rest of the day. All students are to exit in an orderly fashion, administrators have already begun contacting parents as the buses are not running at this time.*”— it was chaos. Students were celebrating, whooping wildly at the prospect of a school day ending right when it had begun, and I was amongst them. Ellen, who was in my homeroom, though, sat quietly at her desk, playing with her necklace nervously.

We eventually all got outside, re-bundled in our absurd coats in the October cold as teachers and admin alike fussed around trying to get everyone a ride home. Eventually, Ellen’s mom showed up. I’d only met her a handful of times, like when she showed up to our housewarming party, but I was always struck with how *tired* she looked. She looked a lot like Ellen, same long and straight blonde hair, same deep green eyes, but hers were accompanied by deep-set dark circles.

“Hi, Mom,” Ellen greeted as her mom approached us, scurrying over to give her a hug.

“Hi, honey. Hello, Amber.”

“Hi Mrs. C!”

Ellen’s mom gave me a small smile before turning back to her daughter. “Alright, sweetheart, let’s go home.”

“Wait, but Amber’s parents aren’t here yet,” Ellen shot a forlorn glance at me, “Can’t we take her home?”

Ellen’s mom bit her lip, then looked around at the mess of adults and teenagers in the sleet-covered parking lot. “I’ll ask her teacher, honey. If they can’t get a hold of her mom or dad, then… sure, your dad’s not home anyway.”

“What about my brother?” I piped up. I had forgotten about Garrett, my older brother. He was 17 at the time, a senior, and abhorred the move even more than I had. Looking back, I can understand how much it would’ve sucked to be uprooted from all your friends with only a year left of school, but at the time we weren’t particularly close and I thought he was being a bit childish about the whole thing.

“I’ll ask about him too, okay?” Ellen’s mom hurried off into the fray, leaving Ellen and I standing together.

“What do you think happened?” I asked as I watched her go. Ellen just shrugged in response. She had been quieter than usual ever since the announcement; I wondered if she was scared.

Her mom came back soon enough and told me that Garrett had gone to a friend’s house.

“Your dad is at work and your mom is a few towns over… it would take her a while to get here, so I’ll take you home, alright?”

“Awesome! Thanks, Mrs. C!”

Ellen’s house, as far as I remember it, was decked out like a combination church–taxidermist. Part of my recollection is probably tainted by years spent away from it, but I certainly remember the barrage of crosses covering any and all wall-space, as well as the ginormous mounted moose head over the fireplace. Ellen told me his name was Moosey; the best she could come up with when her dad had asked her, three years of age at the time, to name it.

We hung out and chatted for a bit until my mom came back, armed with keys to our house and some special food that we could only get from the Target two towns over. She hugged me when she saw me, which confused me— we were never the hugging type. I shook her off with a confused look, but she didn’t seem angry. She just looked at me with reddish eyes and said, “I’m so glad you’re okay, Amber.”

She didn’t explain until we got home, and even then the explanation was abridged. I’ll relay instead what Garrett told me that night, when he had gotten back from his friend’s house smelling like skunk and more giggly than usual. He had snagged a beer from our dad’s stash and would periodically take swigs from it as we sat on the floor of my room, all whilst our younger brother Devin and our parents slept soundly.

Early that morning, a groundskeeper at the school had found Clarice N. in the patch of woods behind the school. Well, first he found her foot, still inside a pink Converse shoe. Then a leg there, an arm here, a torso, and finally her head. She had been ripped apart, not severed cleanly like with a blade. With the amount of blood, at least some of the dismemberment had to have been done while she was alive. Apparently, it was so bloody that one of the responding cops had vomited at the sight of her.

“The cops would’ve probably thought it was an animal, but…” Garrett trailed off, taking another gulp of his beer.

“But what?” I asked, pulling the blanket I had draped over my shoulders closer to me.

“But,” he leaned in, “*someone* put her jacket, all neat and nice, over her body. No animal’s gonna do that.”

I wrinkled my nose. “I bet you’re lying. How do you even know all that stuff?”

“I’m not lying,” Garrett shot back, “My buddy Tyler’s dad is the sheriff. He overheard.”

“Whatever.” I said, feigning disinterest. In reality, Garrett’s story was terrifying and I was more than a little creeped out. I hadn’t known Clarice, she was a junior and one of the Farroway kids, but I knew that she was pretty and one of the popular girls. A boy in my year whose name has long escaped me would always talk about how he was in love with her, all while his friends teased him about how a girl like Clarice would never go for a freshman like him.

Garrett just rolled his eyes and eventually retreated back to his room, muttering about how he wouldn’t bother telling me anything again. I went to bed, but I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I would picture a huge monster chasing me through the woods, eager to rip me up just like Clarice.

School ended up being cancelled for the week. Ellen came over to mine the next day and I excitedly relayed what Garrett had told me, as if it was some juicy story. I don’t think that I had quite comprehended how real it was just yet, still in the mindset of half-believing Garrett had been lying to me to scare me. Ellen also didn’t seem convinced, but she also didn’t react to it with the same vigor I did. Instead, she just asked if we could talk about something else, and I obliged.

The news broke the Clarice story that week, confirming that Garrett had been at least partially right— they called it an animal attack, which I bragged about to Garrett. He had just told me I didn’t understand police business and flipped me off, but I could tell he wasn’t too convinced.

My parents were ostensibly worried about the possibility of a loose, rabid animal, and insisted that I had a buddy to walk with at night, even for distances as short as to and from Ellen’s house. My dad also got a new safe in his office, but at the time I didn’t know what was in it. I thought they were being overprotective, but I listened, for the most part.

I was almost asleep that Friday night when I heard a sound at my window. A thunk, something hard against glass. I sat up, heart racing. Another thunk. It was snowing outside, not the thick flurries that would come starting November, but still enough to drastically reduce my sight.

Against my better judgement, I got out of bed, taking my blanket with me. I even grabbed a paperweight off my desk, as if that would do anything. I stepped toward the window, trying desperately to see who was there. I was on the second floor, but the monster in my dreams was plenty tall enough to reach up.

As I leaned my face closer to the window, something small and hard came out of seemingly nowhere and smacked against the glass, mere inches from my face. I fell backwards, dropping the paperweight and just managing to stifle a yell.

A rock. It was just a rock. I exhaled shakily, collecting my bearings as I walked back toward the window. I wiped away the condensation and saw Ellen, coat over her pajamas, gearing up to throw another rock. When she realized I was at the window, she tossed it to the ground and motioned that I come down. I shot her a thumbs up and began grabbing outerwear, willing my heart rate to slow down as I repeated *it was just Ellen* to myself over and over.

It had really made no sense, though— Ellen wasn’t the type to sneak out, let alone throw rocks at someone’s window. Something was really wrong.

I hurried downstairs and went out the front door; having heard Garrett boast about sneaking out on many occasions, I was fairly confident I wouldn’t get caught.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Clarice didn’t get killed by an animal,” she responded in a whisper, eyes wide, “Somebody killed her.”

“How do you know?”

“Because,” Ellen said, and then pulled something shiny from her pocket, “I found this in my bag today. I forgot I picked it up and put it in there Tuesday morning, I was gonna drop it off at the lost-and-found but then..”

She trailed off.

“What is it?” I asked, shivering half from the cold and half from anticipation.

Ellen unfurled her hand fully, dangling a silver necklace with the letters ‘CN’ attached to it. CN for Clarice N. She had been wearing it in the yearbook photo they had put on the news.

“She could’ve dropped it?”

Ellen shook her head, a look of determination on her face. I had never seen her so convinced of something. “Look closer. I found this at the *front* of the school. Nowhere near the woods at the back.”

I squinted at the necklace, and it was only then that I realized what Ellen was talking about. Across the letters and on the chain, too— drops and smears of dark, almost brownish red.

“Somebody moved her.”
