Hi! I'm Jason, and I live in a smallish town on the eastern side of Texas in a town called "RavensHood". I know just about everyone and everything in this town, and I can't recall when news has ever slipped by me. I'm posting this as a recollection of all the weird or unexplainable things that have happened here, as no one else wants to.

So let's start. I'll start off with a story of a small Mexican Restaurant named "Tacos de janes y francos" or Jane and Franks tacos. The patrons of this place are usually tourists, or just people wanting a taco from anywhere other than taco bell. Tacos are one of the specialties of this place. You can combine and mix different ingredients to create a taco of your liking
However if you went from around 6:30 am and called a specific waiter, and asked for "Mystery" around 15 minutes later you'd have a taco brought to you. This taco consisted of everything a taco would usually consist of and was normal until you ate the meat.
It would taste, well, off. The reason for this was unknown for the next 2-3 years and then one day, in late 2017, someone puked up the Mystery, claiming it was human meat. Apparently the guy was a surviver of a rather brutal plane crash who was forced to eat human meat to survive. An investigation was set up and, low and behold, it was human meat.
Obviously, the place shut down and Jane and Frank were arrested on the spot. I remember the first time I had a Mystery, and thinking about it now, makes me sick.

Anyway onto the next story.
Around 2018 and 2019 there was a series of mysterious disappearances of people who've lived in RavensHood for at least 5 years, which makes me wonder why I was never taken. Anyway rumors went around there was a cult in the woods to the South that worshipped some kind of monster. This turned out to be true. I had heard the rumor at school, and being stupid I went to the woods. What I saw there was, surprisingly nothing, but I couldn't stop hearing a sound like breathing from straight behind me. Then I heard yelling from a few yards behind me. I turn around and it's farmer Henson, but he's a story for another day. Anyway he tells me that I should come into town and get some takeout at the new place that sells teriyaki chicken. Now anyone who's anyone in this town knows damn well there's no place that sells teriyaki chicken.
Knowing this, I figured he'd seen something an wanted to get me out without alerting whatever was nearby. When we got away from the woods he told me what he saw behind me. When he did, I pissed myself.
He had seen something that was supposed to never exist in the first place, a wendigo. And it was a fast one too, so fast I hadn't had time to get a glance at it when I turned around. 
Later that month the disappearing's stopped and nobody ever talked about again.

Next up, something that actually still happens to this day was caused by this. We have a store called Ginger's half off's, where almost every item in the store is sold for half the price of everywhere else. I say almost because every knife, axe, and saw was actually double the price. The reason behind this is that everytime someone buys something like that, they end up dead by the very next week. Maybe it's haunted or something, but all I know is that only 6 people have bought something of that nature and survived. All of which descended from the towns founders. No one knows why, how, or whats doing this.

I think that's all I'm gonna share for now. But I'll make sure to keep this updated, every now and then. But no promises. Till next few stories.
