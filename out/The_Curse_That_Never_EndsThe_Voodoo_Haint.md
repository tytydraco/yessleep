In the humid lowlands of South Carolina, deep in Gullah Geechee country, I lived through a nightmare that began in 1989 and continues to this day. It all started with a desperate mistake—one I will regret for the rest of my life.

I was hungry and desperate when I stumbled upon Miss Emmaline’s garden that fateful evening. New to the area, I had no idea that you should never take from her garden without asking. Miss Emmaline was a powerful voodoo practitioner, feared and respected by everyone around. Her garden was legendary, filled with plants believed to have magical properties passed down from her ancestors.

I snuck in, grabbed some tomatoes, beans, and herbs, and hurriedly stuffed them into my bag. Just as I turned to leave, I saw a shadow and froze. There she was—Miss Emmaline, standing silently with eyes that seemed to look right through me. My heart pounded, but she didn’t say a word. She just stared at me, turned, and walked away. I felt a chill run down my spine, sensing something bad was coming.

That night, I had a horrifying dream. I saw a dark, twisted figure with glowing red eyes and a wicked grin lurking around my house. It was a Leiteimyum, a demonic haint spirit that had never been human, known in Gullah Geechee folklore for its malevolence. When I woke up, I found strange, muddy footprints leading from my bed to the kitchen.

From that day on, my life became a living nightmare. The Leiteimyum brought relentless terror and misfortune. Objects moved on their own, shadows flickered at the corners of my vision, and eerie whispers filled my home. The spirit, summoned by Miss Emmaline’s curse, was relentless. It hid my keys, spoiled my food, and broke my things. It scratched at the walls, leaving marks that seemed like warnings.

One night, as I lay in bed, I smelled something foul and heard the sound of scratching at my window. I turned to see the Leiteimyum's grotesque face pressed against the glass, its eyes burning with hatred. It clawed its way inside, and I could feel its icy breath as it whispered dark, incomprehensible threats. Terrified, I screamed, but the spirit vanished into the shadows before anyone could come to my aid.

The Leiteimyum didn’t just stop at tormenting me with small tricks. It began to invade my dreams, turning them into twisted nightmares where I was chased through endless dark corridors by unseen horrors. I’d wake up with scratches and bruises, signs that the demon’s reach extended beyond the dream world.

One evening, while I was cooking dinner, the lights began to flicker. I heard a low, guttural growl behind me. Turning around, I saw the Leiteimyum standing there, its body contorted and its eyes blazing with malice. It lunged at me, knocking the pot off the stove and setting the kitchen ablaze. I barely escaped with my life as the house burned down, the Leiteimyum’s laughter echoing in the flames.

Years passed, and my life grew increasingly horrific. The Leiteimyum followed me everywhere, ensuring my life was filled with fear and misery. My relationships fell apart, I lost jobs, and my health deteriorated rapidly. The spirit tormented me with nightmarish visions, made me ill, and even caused accidents that left me injured and scarred.

Now, in 2024, I am much older, exhausted, and a frail woman due to what I've experienced. But the terror has never stopped. Miss Emmaline had long since passed away, but her legend and stories of her garden remain. I returned to where it all began, standing at the edge of the overgrown garden, feeling the weight of my sins and the curse that has haunted me for decades.

Crying, I knelt in the soil and begged for forgiveness, hoping that the spirits of Miss Emmaline’s ancestors would hear my plea. But as I wept, the air grew cold and the ground beneath me seemed to tremble. From the shadows emerged the Leiteimyum, its eyes burning brighter than ever.

"You think you can undo what you did?" a voice hissed, echoing all around me. It was Miss Emmaline’s voice, filled with anger and fury. "You took from me, and now the Leiteimyum will take from you for all eternity."

I screamed, but my cries were swallowed by the darkness. The Leiteimyum lunged at me, its claws sinking deep into my flesh. I felt a burning pain and then nothing but endless darkness.

My life did not end that night. Instead, my torment became eternal. The Leiteimyum remains by my side, dragging my soul through endless nightmares and horrors beyond imagination. My story became a cautionary tale, a chilling warning to all who might think of crossing the Gullah Geechee magic.

The legend of Miss Emmaline and her vengeful Leiteimyum endures, a terrifying reminder of the consequences of disrespect and the power of the old ways. No one ever dared to steal from Miss Emmaline’s garden again. And I remain trapped in my personal hell, forever paying the price for my foolish mistake.
