*But the LORD said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.*

I could see the light going out of her eyes. That was always the sign I looked for as a mark that it had begun. Slowly, and in fits, they would suffer these half-deaths in my presence -- this momentary catatonia. It was then that I knew they had seen it, and from then it was only a matter of time. It had taken a couple of months with Grace.

We met at a bar. I had spent the evening drinking alone, as had become my Saturday ritual. She met my gaze from across the room and, Christ, it was exactly like the old cliche. We both felt the magic at the same instant; I’m sure of it, because she walked right up to me and introduced herself. From that moment on, I knew I’d be powerless against her. All she had to do was touch my arm to seal the deal.

I tried to stop myself, I really did, but there was nothing I could do. What I had intended to be a one-night stand turned, once more, into a regular thing and we were all but officially dating two weeks later. It had gone so well that I even managed to convince myself that the inevitable wouldn’t happen this time around -- that Grace was different.

She wasn’t.

One night as we sat across from each other at my dining room table, I saw her gaze drawn to my chest. It lingered there slightly too long, and it took my calling her name twice before she came back to Earth.

“Sorry,” she said, slightly breathless.

For the remainder of the conversation her typical enthusiasm was replaced with a dull, pensive gaze which returned again and again to my chest on the left side. I tried to tell myself that it was nothing, that she was merely tired. However, the same thing happened the next night, and every night until she broke it off over text:

“Sorry, it’s just not going to work out. Goodbye, Lou.”

And that was the end of it.

That night, in the shower, I ran my finger over the left side of my chest and peered down, ignoring the incredible strain this awkward angle placed on my neck and back. A small, misshapen, dark mark pulsed just beneath the surface of my skin, like a neon sign in reverse.

And, for what seemed the millionth time, I scrubbed at it with ferocity. This only resulted in the skin surrounding the mark turning pink and then red before slowly fading back to its normal color. Doctor after doctor had insisted that it wasn’t there, and most people seemed totally oblivious to it. The mark only ever seemed to reveal itself to the people I really cared about, and then after an unpredictable length of time. Grace had been slow on the uptake. Some girls seemed to notice it hours or minutes after meeting me. The previous record had been held by a dark-skinned brunette whose name I can no longer recall who had taken a week to see it.

But it always revealed itself eventually and it always drove them away.

\*\*\*

I felt stupid for crying over her. What had I expected? That somehow I could suddenly rewrite the laws of nature and make a lasting connection? It had never been so and never could be. Later that night I got blind drunk, literally. I was so plastered that everything spun and I couldn’t keep my eyes focused. This resulted in a facedown nap in my laundry hamper.

This might have been funny under different circumstances but I wasn’t in the laughing mood. When I woke, it was with a start which disturbed my precarious position and left me and my dirty clothes in a heap on the floor. The pain was nothing compared to my headache. Through bleary eyes I peered at my phone and winced as the light sent sharp stabs of pain through my skull. After blinking a few times I could handle looking at it for a few moments at a time and saw that I had apparently spent most of the night calling Grace. She had not picked up even once, but had sent me a text comprised of the ominous and definitive message: “Blocking this number. DON’T CALL AGAIN.”

Another man might have felt himself in the right, despite his inebriated state, in insisting on closure after something like this. I didn’t need it however. I knew why she had left.

A lot of the rest of that day was spent in the dark, with an ice pack on my head, trying to recover the ability to handle light and sound. I called into work sick with an unconvincing excuse which my supervisor had received with the appropriate tone of skepticism.

I didn’t care.

\*\*\*

The following day it was time to give my presentation to the board. Having lost the previous 24 hours to the application of various hangover remedies drawn from the internet in the few seconds of time in which I could tolerate the searing pain of my phone’s screen, the version of the presentation I ultimately ended up giving was barely adequate. At least, I hoped that it had been.

I noticed a female board member stifling laughter during some of my particularly absurd displays of ineptitude, such as attempting, and failing, to correctly pronounce “Mozambique” four consecutive times. For whatever reason, this seemed to be a positive sign. Or, perhaps it was wishful thinking.

\*\*\*

Just ten minutes before the end of the day, I heard a knock on my office door and called out to whomever had made it,

“Come in.”

And when I turned to see who it was I was shocked to find my doorstep darkened by the female board member from earlier.

“Hi, Lou, right?”

I nodded, and realized that I didn’t even know her name.

“Do you want to join me after work, for drinks?”

She could get in serious trouble for even asking that question and I experienced a thousand emotions at once, the more lurid of which eventually won out.

“Sure,” I said.

“Alright, I’ll see you at the bar down the street then? At, say, 5:30?”

Again, I nodded. She turned and swept out of the room, closing the door as she did so.

“Maybe my luck is turning around after all,” I murmured to myself.

\*\*\*

She showed up at 5:30, though I had believed seriously that she would not. We sat down next to each other. I ordered a beer and she something suitably feminine -- precisely what it was I cannot recall. As we began talking it occurred to me again that I didn’t even know her name, and, knowing that it was impossible to continue a conversation forever without that knowledge, I simply asked her what it was.

“Yes, of course you don’t know my name!” she laughed. “I’m a new addition to the board. I’m Claire,” she said, extending her hand. I took it in mine.

Soft, smooth, warm.

“So was my presentation really that good?” I asked, smiling a little.

“No, it was really quite dreadful,” she answered, returning the smile and placing her hand on top of mine. “But, let’s forget that. Maybe we should forget the drinks altogether and go straight back to my place.”

As she said this, I choked a little on the sip I had just taken.

“Really?” I asked, stupidly.

“Really,” she said, maintaining eye contact. I stood, dreamily, and allowed her to lead me outside and to her car, entirely forgetting about mine or what would happen to it were I to leave it on the sidewalk for the rest of the night.

But, just as she was about to turn to open the car door, something stopped her and she looked at me strangely -- directly at the left side of my chest.

“I’m sorry, Lou. I just remembered. My sister is coming tonight. I can’t. I’ll see you later.”

And, with that, she stepped into the car and drove off into the night.

\*\*\*

Later that night I woke up in front of the TV with several bottles of beer covering my body and the TV blaring noisily. My head killed. Sometimes, a shower can help with that. So, I walked into the bathroom and waited for the hot water to start flowing.

Once inside the shower, I sighed deeply and pressed my forehead against the wall, a position with which I was all too familiar.

“That’s a record, I think,” I said to myself. “Only took her half a day.”

Then, I glowered at the mark over my heart. It pulsed gently. Like it was mocking me. In a fit of sudden clarity, I grabbed a pair of fingernail scissors which was lying on the little shower shelf which held various hygiene products.

Then, without a moment’s hesitation, I brought it down onto my chest, ignoring the pain and the spilling forth of my lifeblood into the greedy showerhead stream. It mingled with the water, forming snakelike tendrils of scarlet and whisking themselves away down the drain.

I dragged the scissors around the mark, cutting deep in order to ensure that the scissors had punctured every layer of skin. The surge of adrenaline was weakening somewhat, and the first scream fell from my lips as my fingers dug in between the severed and healthy flesh and tore the patch of skin off, bringing forth a torrent of blood, almost black in its thickness. Then, triumphantly, I hurled the mark down into the drain and grabbed a roll of medical gauze from the cupboard next to the shower, spilling water and blood all over the ground as I did so.

The gauze soaked through and I replaced it accordingly, then proceeded to dry and clothe myself. After replacing the gauze several times I began to fear that the amount left in my first aid kit after my skating mishap wouldn’t be sufficient. For a little while, my arms grew weak and I further feared that the whole thing had been a serious miscalculation on my part. But, the blood did stop and the strength did return to my limbs after several hours spent lying on my bed.

Some of that effect may have been due to my liver processing some of the alcohol circulating in its bloodstream. Blood loss and alcohol do not mix well, after all.

So, after recovering my strength, I stood and hobbled back into the bathroom to get a clear look at my handiwork. While covered in gauze and blood, it was difficult to say whether or not my goal had been achieved, but it looked like a pretty comprehensive job to me and so, satisfied, I fell back onto the couch and returned to the void of unconsciousness.

\*\*\*

When I woke, it was not immediately obvious how much time had passed. After checking my watch I saw that it was half past ten the next day. Fortunately, it was Saturday.

It occurred to me then that the gauze would no doubt need changing and so I dragged myself back into the bathroom and peeled it off of my skin, no doubt bringing some of the latter with it. But, as my fingers fumbled with the first aid kit, the sight of the wound was enough to send me staggering backwards, and nearly into the tub.

Not because it was especially grizzly or infected or in any way unseemingly, but because of what I saw embedded right at the center of the congealed blood and newly forming scab.

At that very spot, exactly where it had been before, was a small, misshapen, dark mark which pulsed just beneath the surface of the scab, like a neon sign in reverse.

I declined to get back up, electing instead to lie where I had fallen, with my head between my knees and the tears flowing freely onto the tiled floor.
