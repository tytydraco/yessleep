The task came about on an ordinary, April day. It was contained in the classic, yellow, gaudy envelope (*as are all the tasks*). 

It was delivered to me personally by my ordinary secretary (*as are all the tasks*).

And it was sealed with a garish company insignia (*yep*). 

By tradition, I unsealed the envelope with the standard, company provided, paper knife. I poured myself a not so standard, not so company provided, glass of MacAllen whiskey. 

I took a swig.

Sliced the stamped insignia. 

Unfolded the letter. Turned my eyes to that familiar, spidery blue ink that was scrawled across the dreaded page. It read the following:

——————-

Project GASH 

Dear G

Get to Cavern Creek. Arrive tomorrow at noon. Why don’t you stay for a night?

Bring S and H. 

She will come for you at night. Do not bring or emit any form of light. 

Get out before Sunday sunrise.

A

——————

*To quickly explain for those confused*….

The letters are our names - randomly assigned allocations. I’ve been G ever since I joined the place. 

I’ve also worked with S and H for going on a decade. I have no idea what their real names are (though I highly and often suspect that H is called Bob - he just has that ‘Bob look’ about him - you know?)

A slight tangent, but I’ve heard that my colleague ‘X’ is the best of the best. Apparently, they only bring him out when jobs go wrong. Thankfully, I’ve never met him. I imagine he’s really called Ken or something, to entertain myself. 

Getting back on track - the envelopes always have 2 familiar quirks. You’ve probably worked this out already, but I’ll explain in any case:

First: the gaudy envelopes are always sent by one of our 5 bosses. They are called: A, E, I, O and U. People call them the Vowels (creative).

As far as I’m aware, the Vowels don’t do any fieldwork, though I assume they used to back in the day. 

Second: the project name is always an anagram assembled by the letter allocations of those working on the project  (i.e. I’m G and this time I’m on a job with A, S and H - hence, Project GASH). Thankfully, this isn’t Project SHAG or Project HAGS. 

I once worked on the 15 man job: Project UNCOPYRIGHTABLE. It was terrible and mainly involved paperwork.

I’ve heard rumours of an 18 man job but I call bullshit. There’s 26 employees and no repeat letters - is there an 18 letter word? 

Regardless, the point of this tangent is to say that, I’m pretty familiar with these jobs. I’d like to say familiar to the extent that they rarely trouble me. But this time was different.

For some reason not known to me, this particular task has seriously unnerved me. 

Sure, I’ve been given weird instructions before. In Project GEM (a truly great initiative led by E), I had to ‘imagine’ that I was a tree for two hours every Sunday - otherwise I’d be killed by a screaming banshee named ‘Doris’. 

On Project GRAB (led by A), I had to jump off the Elizabeth Tower (i.e. Big Ben) as the clock struck 12. 

The point I’m trying to make is that Project GASH has pretty clear instructions - and we’re taught, “follow the instructions, or you’ll die.” Yet, I’m really uneasy. 

As a result, I’ve decided to finally break my silence on the work I do and document this particular experience (strength in numbers and all of that). I obviously can’t bring my phone with me on this mission, as that emits light, so I’ll be recording a transcript. This will wire directly to my previously mentioned ‘ordinary’ secretary (sorry Emma), who will type up the the account of my time in Cavern Creek. 

I’m going to go and find S and H. I’ll enter into this log shortly.

We’re going to Cavern Creek.

______________
11pm - same day 

Well, needless to say, S and H weren’t best pleased with the situation. 

“Don’t emit light? Where the fuck is Cavern Creek anyway?” S hissed. 

“Yep, no phones, no torches, no matchsticks. No fucking idea where Cavern Creek is.” I said. 

H had other concerns:

“Guys my hair falling out”….

“It’s because you are called Bob and Bob’s go bald, H. Deal with it” I quipped. 

“Seriously - look.” 

Upon closer examination, S and I concluded a significant amount of H’s hair had fallen out. I don’t think it can be put down to the stress of work either - this seemed pretty rapid. When he eventually walked out the room, we noticed that clumps of his hair had practically trailed behind him. 

Side effects are a part of the job and it’s something you grow to live with. Usually, these are only short term and reverse themselves once the task is complete…. usually.

What is unusual, however, is what happened when I came home tonight. At first I was fine. I was full of that mix of part excitement/part exponential dread (you know - just work things). 

But here’s the funny thing. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched? 
 
Enough said. Our task is to get to Cavern Creek, and we are going in blind.

I’ll update you tomorrow.
