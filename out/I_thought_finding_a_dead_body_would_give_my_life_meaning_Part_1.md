All my life, I thought I was a failure because I never found a dead body. But after I kept stumbling across them, I now know that it's not the blessing I thought it would be.

Let me start at the beginning. This story began when I was ten, living at my family’s cabin in the Catskills.

It was mid-April, the tail end of hiking season. Our neighbor, the ever-jovial old man we called Laughing Benny, had gone missing. People whispered he might be the latest victim of the infamous Catskills ‘Big Foot Killer,’ who supposedly preyed on late-season hikers.

The police and Greater New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (GNYSDEC) forest rangers swarmed the area to search for him.

“Local hunters are urged to report to the staging area at the Ranger Center to assist with the search,” droned Klint Conklin, my favorite WJFFF Catskills radio newscaster, on the morning news.

I listened to Klint’s monotone as I finished my breakfast of whey toast and poached quail eggs, paired with sizzling deer bacon fresh off our family’s skillet — a relic that hadn’t seen soap since the 1900s. My dad, seated across from me, was already polishing off his plate of venison sausage and scrambled ostrich eggs.

He looked up, wiped his mouth, and said, “You know what, Wendy? This will toughen you up. Get your jacket and let’s go.”

I barely squeaked out a “Coming!” as I shoved the last bite of the elk butter-streaked toast into my mouth. I grabbed my hunting jacket and followed my dad to his beat-up old Fjord pickup. He drove us to the search party’s staging area, near Old Man Jeffrey’s ranch where he raised his award-winning quails and ostriches.

I was thrilled. Finding Laughing Benny would be my chance to prove myself. Maybe if I found his body, I’d finally earn some respect — and maybe even catch the attention of Jane Jacoby. She was tall, slender, and way out of my league, but I could already hear her voice in my head:

“Oh, Wendy! You’re my hero!”

She’d see me as more than the neighborhood joke, a boy saddled with a girl’s name. She’d see me as a hero.

But it wasn’t meant to be. Jimmy, the kid from a few cabins up north, found Laughing Benny’s bloated, rotting corpse first. That discovery catapulted Jimmy to local fame. He became the poster boy for Catskills Teens and later became the county sheriff and eventually married Jane.

I told myself my bad luck began that day. If only I’d been the one to find Benny. How wrong I was.

Fueled by my obsession, I joined the Junior Ranger program in high school and, later, enrolled in the local Ranger Center training program at Catskills Community College. I graduated as a full-fledged ranger, specializing in search and rescue. Joining GNYSDEC’s elite Patrol Officers Specializing in Searching for Unfortunate Mountaineers unit, POSSUM for short. I convinced myself my mission in life was to find dead bodies. If I couldn’t win Jane’s heart, I could at least become the best at that.

But no matter how hard I tried, the dead bodies eluded me. Time after time, lost hikers would be miraculously found alive. Even in dire cases, injuries were the worst we encountered. My colleagues nicknamed me “Lucky Wendy” for my streak of rescues without fatalities. They meant it as a compliment, but it felt like a curse to me.

The only dead bodies I ever encountered were fictional — in Creepy Pasta stories, Creepcats episodes, and the exciting tales spun by Navy SEAL-turned-YouTuber MrBraillen. My thirst for meaning went unquenched.

That will change soon, though, in ways I could never have imagined. In any case, I’ve just been called out to another recovery mission. I’ll tell you more, in my next post.
