“Paid hitchhiker. $150/hr. Two-hour nights, Monday through Friday, 8–10 p.m.”

I did the math in my head. About $6,500 a month. Not bad.

As that thought sank in, I realized studying music theory had probably been a mistake.

Still, I decided to reply to the listing.

I answered a few questions, attached my resume—though I wasn’t sure what good that would do—and hit send.

Almost instantly, I got a response. I’d half-expected that; I couldn’t imagine many people jumping at this position.

“Thank you for your interest in the hitchhiking position. We’re excited to invite you to move forward with the interview process, and we look forward to getting to know you professionally.”

I typed back quickly:

“Thanks for reaching out! I’d be glad to move forward with the interview. What dates and times work best for you?”

The reply came moments later.

“Friday”—followed by a set of coordinates.

I plugged them into Google Maps. The destination was a small building on a long road in the middle of a forest. On Street View, the place looked distorted, almost blurred. All I could make out was a sign:

“No soliciting. No religion. No unscheduled meetings.”

It was Wednesday then. I tried to convince myself I didn’t need the money, that it wasn’t worth the risk. But the truth was, I did need the money. Badly. I was drowning in debt, and every last dollar would help.

By Friday night, I was in my beat-up car, headed toward the coordinates.

When I arrived, I saw the rest of the building the Street View had obscured. It was larger than I’d imagined: two stories and a basement, the latter revealed by the rows of windows sunk into the foundation. The whole place was gray concrete, punctuated by thin sheet metal doors.

I tried the front door—locked. Knocked—no answer. So I sat on a wooden bench about fifteen feet from the entrance and waited.

It was 7:30, the forest nearly pitch black, when two pairs of headlights appeared on the driveway. From one car stepped a tall man with thinning black hair; from the other, a scrawny kid, maybe nineteen at most. The tall one approached first.

“Hello. My name is Geoffrey.”

“Devon,” I replied.

“This is your partner, Jame.”

“Partner?” I asked.

I glanced at Jame. He was gripping his right bicep tightly with his left hand. When he noticed me looking, he released it, raised a hesitant hand in greeting. I waved back with an awkward smile.

“Yes,” Geoffrey said evenly. “Your partner.”

After a long silence, he added, “Shall we head inside?”

I nodded, and we followed him in.

The interior was exactly what I’d pictured: bare concrete walls, dim light, and a single desk in the middle of the room. Geoffrey took a seat, and Jame and I sat opposite him.

“Can I ask you both a question?” Geoffrey said, pen poised above a sheet of paper.

We nodded.

“What was the most scared you’ve ever been?”

I hesitated, hoping Jame would answer first. He didn’t.

“My house was broken into when I was sixteen,” I said, giving a small, nervous laugh at the end.

Geoffrey scribbled something down. Then he turned to Jame.

“I don’t know,” Jame muttered.

Geoffrey studied him for a moment, then nodded. “Very well. Shall we get you both suited up?”

We exchanged a glance and answered, “Sure.”

He led us to a small room with a closet and two changing booths. Handing me a bag of ragged, tattered clothing, he gestured for me to change. Inside the booth, I slipped into the clothes. They looked filthy but smelled surprisingly clean.

When I stepped out, I saw Jame. He was dressed in a perfectly tailored suit, spotless and elegant. We stared at each other in confusion. Geoffrey just grinned, wide and satisfied.

“Perfect,” he said.

“Devon, follow me please. We’ll need to touch up your look a bit more.”

He guided me toward another door leading down to the basement. At the center of the room stood a red vanity table, stocked with makeup.

“Sit,” Geoffrey instructed.

I sat. Staring at myself in the mirror, I wondered how on earth I’d ended up here.

Geoffrey went to work with brushes and sponges, moving with the ease of experience. When he finished, my reflection looked ragged: my face dirtied, hair greasy, eyes sunken.

We went back upstairs. “Your turn,” Geoffrey said to Jame.

Jame descended into the basement as I waited. When he reappeared, his transformation was startling. His hair was neatly combed, his skin glowing, his eyes an unnatural bright blue—contacts, I guessed.

Geoffrey clasped his hands together. “Now, a few rules before you head out.”

He recited them one by one:
	•	Never enter the black truck, even if it seems like your last hope.
	•	If you ever see a man identical to yourself, get into the car, nod to him, and exit immediately.
	•	If the radio is set to 99.3, get out of the car, no matter how fast it’s moving.
	•	Never allow your driver to pick up another hitchhiker.

“Everything clear?”

We both nodded.

“Wonderful. Please, follow me.”

He led us to his car, opening the front passenger seat and one of the back doors. Jame hesitated, so I took the front.

“We’ll head to your site first, Jame,” Geoffrey said.

“Okay,” Jame murmured.

We drove through darkness in silence until a bench appeared by the roadside—identical to the one I’d waited on earlier.

“Your stop,” Geoffrey said.

Jame stepped out, sat on the bench, and stuck out his thumb.

“Onwards to your site,” Geoffrey told me.

As we drove, I finally asked what had been nagging at me.

“Why did Jame get the nice makeover? Wouldn’t I be better suited to play the businessman? I mean, the kid’s a twig.”

Geoffrey ignored me at first, eyes fixed on the road. Then he smiled, put the car in park, and leaned over me to pop open my door.

“Remember to tell them to bring you right back to the building.” he said.

“You didn’t tell Jame that,” I pointed out.

“Don’t worry,” Geoffrey replied. “He knows.”

I figured he’d gone over more rules with Jame during his makeover.

I stepped out and sat on the bench.

About thirty minutes passed before I saw headlights. I stuck my thumb out, but the car flew past, not even slowing.

Ten minutes later, the woods behind me stirred. At first, just rustling. Then twigs snapping, something pacing, circling. The sound of deliberate movement—closer each time I ignored it.

And then the black truck arrived.

It didn’t appear down the road like a normal vehicle—it was there, headlights already blazing, horn already screaming. The air itself seemed to vibrate from the sound. The beams of light blinded me, catching every raindrop, every speck of dust in their glare.

I shielded my face as the truck crept toward me. The horn blared again—long, metallic, almost animal in howling pitch.

“GET THE HELL IN!” a voice shrieked from inside. Not one voice, but dozens, layered over each other, all mismatched in tone but perfectly in unison.

Through the windshield, shadows moved violently, like a crowd crammed into a space meant for one driver. Faces slammed against the glass, mouths wide, eyes wide, distorted.

I couldn’t breathe. My legs felt like they were tied down, every instinct screaming at me to run, but I stayed rooted.

The truck edged closer, engine rumbling, horn stabbing through the night again and again.

“GET IN. GET IN. GET IN.”

The forest behind me fell silent, as if whatever had been lurking stepped back to give the truck room.

I sat perfectly still, fingers digging into the bench. I don’t know how long it lasted. Time felt suspended, the horn pressing into my skull like a migraine.

Finally, the headlights clicked off. The voices stopped.

The truck was gone. No sound of an engine retreating. Just… gone.

I was alone again.

Another twenty minutes passed before I saw the next car. It crawled along the road at an unnatural pace—15 mph at most. No sound of an engine, just tires crunching gravel.

When it reached me, the driver’s window rolled down.

And I saw myself.

Not just a resemblance—me. Identical down to the tattered clothes, the smeared makeup, even the way I hunched forward on bad posture.

His eyes locked on mine. He didn’t smile, didn’t wave. Just waited.

The silence was unbearable. I walked toward the car. My stomach flipped, but I couldn’t stop. I opened the passenger door, stepped in, and sat.

We didn’t speak.

He didn’t look at me again. He simply tapped the wheel twice with one hand, like a signal.

I nodded back, throat tight.

The moment I closed the door, he pressed the gas, the car jolting forward with impossible speed. But after no more than a hundred feet, he braked, and I knew—get out.

I opened the door, stepped into the night, and the car was already gone. No tail lights. No trace. Just emptiness where it had been.

I exhaled shakily, realizing I’d been holding my breath the whole time.

Finally, a normal car appeared. The driver leaned out.

“Where to?”

“Just up the road,” I said quickly, desperate to leave.

For a moment I panicked—I hadn’t checked the radio. My head snapped toward it.

112.7.

Safe.

Relief washed over me like air after drowning.

On the way back, the driver squinted at the roadside.

“Jesus, what happened to that guy?” he muttered.

I followed his gaze and my heart collapsed.

Jame.

He was sprawled out in the gravel, one arm twitching weakly, blood spreading in a dark halo beneath him. His white shirt—once perfect—was soaked red. His face was pale, slack, but his eyes were still open. Still alive.

“Stop the car!” I yelled.

The driver slowed, uneasy. “I don’t know, man—”

“STOP!”

I threw the door open before the car even halted, stumbling onto the shoulder and running to him.

“Jame! Jame, it’s me!”

He turned his head with visible effort, his lips trembling like he was trying to form words. A wet cough sprayed crimson down his chin.

His hand shook as it reached toward me. I gripped it tight, but his grip was ice-cold, already fading.

He coughed, body shuddering. “Don’t… let them…” His eyes darted toward the trees as if something was watching us. Then back to me, wide and terrified. “Promise me…”

“I promise, I promise,” I said, though I had no idea what he meant.

His chest rose once more, then faltered. His body went slack.

Nothing. Just the trickle of blood running downhill, soaking into the gravel.

Behind me, the driver called out nervously, “Hey, man, we should go… seriously, we should go.”

I pressed Jame’s hand to my chest one last time before laying it down. My own hands were trembling so badly I could barely stand.

Tears blurred my vision as I staggered back to the car. I didn’t speak for the rest of the ride.

When Geoffrey greeted me back at the building with his usual cheer, I could barely contain myself.

“Did you see Jame?” he asked lightly.

“He’s dead,” I snapped, voice cracking.

Geoffrey only tilted his head, almost like he was amused. “Oh, what a shame. Don’t stay the night.”

“That’s it? That’s all you have to say?”

“I told you not to worry about your partners, Devon. It does no good.”

I wanted to scream at him, but the words died in my throat. Instead, I turned and left.

The drive back home was silent. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel, Jame’s last words echoing in my head.

The forest road stretched endlessly, a tunnel of black trees pressing in on both sides. That’s when I saw him.

A lone figure on the shoulder, illuminated in my headlights.

He was filthy—long, tangled beard, patchy buzzed scalp, and clothes that looked like they’d been torn to shreds weeks ago. He was already standing with his thumb out, arm stiff like it had been raised for hours.

I slowed instinctively. Something about him made my stomach twist. His eyes glinted in the light, too sharp, too deliberate.

I pressed on the gas, deciding to pass him.

The moment I did, his head snapped toward me. His eyes followed my car perfectly, his body jerking into motion.

He ran.

I glanced in the mirror and nearly swerved—the man was sprinting after me, barefoot, stumbling, but impossibly fast. His mouth hung open, teeth bared, and his voice carried through the trees.

“COWARD!” he bellowed, the word ragged, broken by wheezes.

I floored it, but his voice didn’t fade.

“COWARD! YOU’LL END LIKE THE REST!”

I couldn’t stop shaking. My speedometer climbed, but still, his figure clung to the road in my mirror longer than it should have. Too long. Until finally, after what felt like a mile, he was gone.

The forest swallowed him, but his voice lingered in my ears like static.

Coward… coward… end like the rest…

By the time I got home, my hands still hadn’t stopped trembling. I went to bed without changing, face pressed into the pillow, heart pounding.

Two months passed. Geoffrey replaced Jame again and again, but none lasted longer than a week. Some came back bruised and broken, others simply didn’t come back at all. Geoffrey never flinched—he only smiled, adjusted his notes, and prepared another partner.

And I kept returning. Night after night, each ride gnawed away at me. The rules ran laps in my head even when I was home, as if the job followed me there.

Tomorrow night, I’ve decided, I’m going to talk to Geoffrey about quitting. I’ve already rehearsed how I’ll say it: firm, polite, like it’s just a simple resignation.

I hope he understands.
