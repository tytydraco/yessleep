I'd always been a fan of photography, capturing candid moments and beautiful landscapes with my camera. Last week, I went on a solo hiking trip to a secluded forest known for its untouched beauty. It was the perfect place to unwind and add some stunning shots to my collection.

After a day of hiking and snapping photos, I set up my tent and prepared for the night. As dusk settled, I reviewed the pictures on my camera, admiring the play of light and shadow in the forest. Satisfied, I turned off the camera and decided to take one last photo with my phone to send to my family—a simple shot of my campsite against the backdrop of the darkening trees.

Exhausted, I crawled into my sleeping bag and quickly drifted off to sleep.

A loud rustling noise jolted me awake in the middle of the night. I listened intently, but the forest had fallen eerily silent. My heart pounded as I strained to hear any sign of movement outside my tent, but there was nothing. Convincing myself it was just an animal, I eventually fell back asleep.

The next morning, I packed up my gear and headed back home. Later that evening, as I relaxed on my couch, I remembered the photo I had taken with my phone. I opened my gallery and found it, smiling at the memory of my peaceful campsite.

Then I noticed something that made my blood run cold.

In the corner of the photo, barely visible in the encroaching darkness, was a figure standing among the trees. Its face was pale, eyes wide and unblinking, staring directly at the camera.

I knew I had been alone in that forest. I had felt it.

Terrified, I zoomed in on the figure, hoping it was just a trick of the light. But the closer I looked, the clearer it became. It wasn't an animal. It wasn't a shadow. It was a person, standing impossibly still, watching me.

I deleted the photo immediately, but the image is burned into my mind. I can't shake the feeling of those eyes on me, even now, as I sit here typing this. I haven’t slept well since. Every time I close my eyes, I see that figure, standing silently in the darkness.

Watching. Waiting.

Two nights ago, I heard rustling outside my window. My heart nearly stopped as I lay frozen in my bed, listening. I told myself it was just the wind or a stray animal, but deep down, I knew better.

Last night, I was startled awake again by a noise—a soft tapping on my bedroom window. With trembling hands, I reached for my phone and turned on the flashlight. I shone it towards the window, but there was nothing there. The tapping continued, growing more insistent. Summoning every ounce of courage, I crept towards the window and pulled back the curtain.

There, on the other side of the glass, was the same pale face from the photo, eyes wide and unblinking. It pressed its hand against the glass, and I saw my breath fog up the window in sheer terror.

I stumbled back, dropping my phone. The tapping stopped. My heart hammered in my chest as I scrambled to pick up my phone and call the police. They arrived quickly, but found no sign of anyone outside my house.

I don't know what that thing is or what it wants, but I can feel its eyes on me, even now. It’s always watching, always waiting. I don’t think I’ll ever be free of it.

And I’m terrified that one day, it won’t be outside my window—it’ll be inside my house.
