Roughly 2 years ago my family and I moved from the city to the suburbs, and we slowly became accustomed to the change in our daily lifestyle. Rather than walking everywhere, we relied on cars to take us even to the nearest convenience store. Instead of spending the day window-shopping or sitting in a cafe finishing some work, we stayed enclosed in our house. The commute to work went from 45-minutes to almost 2 hours, which was troublesome at times given the country's lack of funding to infrastructure and public transportation. I never really found a reason to have a car, but now that we live somewhere where there are more cars on the streets than people - needless to say it was a large adjustment for everyone. And to be honest, I do not see myself adjusting ever. I hated the quiet, the lack of activities and just staying home all day. 

Not even 3 months after we moved in, my stepfather's aunt suddenly came to stay with us. She had recently immigrated from our motherland and was staying with her brother who lives in another state. While being quiet is not really a bad thing, she was too eerie from the beginning. Always lurking, and when you catch her eyes, she flashes a large toothless grin that does not disappear until you look away. Always. I never understood why she did not want to stay with her brother; while a big frugal, his kind demeanor and happy-go-lucky attitude always made you feel at home. 

It wasn't until a few days later when a huge fight broke out, and it caused a rift between my mother and stepfather. This argument waxed and waned; sometimes a few taunts here and there, sometimes full-blown yelling match, and before I knew it, months had passed. My stepfather's parents, who also stayed with us, took the aunt and moved into the basement. There were already rooms there from the previous owner, and we added a kitchen during the renovation in the odd chance we might have to rent it out. 

The fighting slowly subdued around and ended like all other previous fights. Heavy words and unproven accusations were thrown, which were later forgotten to time. No apologies, or discussions or any sort of discourse. But I remember them, and I am still waiting for some sort of resolution to them. But as days pass, I highly doubt there will be closure in my lifetime. 

After several months, my stepfather wanted to bring another person into the house. A stranger that recently widowed, who did not want to stay with her daughter over an argument. I did not pay too much attention to the reason, but it was something along the lines of property that was in the will. My mother adamantly against this; not only is this woman a stranger, but we have never heard of her until a few months ago. However, when you live in a patriarchal household, I already know what was going to happen. My stepfather was going to get his way. And after a few weeks, he brought her into the house. Set her up in another room in the basement, where the grandparents and aunt were. At first, she would rarely speak but was always pleasant, but after a couple months she slowly became judgmental and demanding. Always giving her opinion on a topic when no one was talking to her or questioning certain aspects of our lives. Nothing to me personally, since I do not speak to her nor give her an opportunity. But a few times we did butt heads, and I would always tell her she is out of line, making demands of me in random moments. And like all arguments, it would go into the abyss of avoidance. 

This past winter, my biological grandmother came to stay with us. She has a house back home and usually is fine. However, she had a recent fall and my aunts/uncles wanted to make sure she was alright, so they brought her over. Because everyone has work, naturally it fell onto my mom who was mostly at home. 

Growing up with her, I quickly realized that my mother did not have nurturing qualities of a caretaker. So, my grandmother coming in definitely put a strain on her, the already present anxiety doubling this; and making it unbearable at times. She couldn't leave the house since my grandmother needed constant care, so she slowly started to spend time downstairs. A floor of concrete giving her a moment of solace when it got too much for her. At first it was once every few days, then once a day. Currently multiple times a day. Every time we would question where my mom could be, it was a 99.9% chance she was downstairs. 

This incident during dinner always kept playing in my mind. Normally, I eat dinner around 6-7pm. My mother eats it much later, around 10pm, shortly before going to bed. My grandmother was watching her nightly TV news broadcast, so it was just my mom eating by herself. I did not have work the next day, so I wanted to just with her and keep her company while she eats. She was eating, so I did not expect her to respond often, but I noticed she kept her eyes glued to her phone. Remembering how she would berate my siblings for watching and eating, I jokingly told her '*How the tables have turned*'. She never laughed at my jokes before, so it did not surprise me that she ignored me and focused on her phone. Then she shoots up from her seat, tells me she wants to get another serving for herself and goes to the stove to do just that. The kitchen is right next to the basement, so she can easily have a conversation from upstairs. I hear her ask what they made for dinner, since they also eat around the same time. I did not hear a response. However, she went started to make her way downstairs even before she finished her sentence. Leaving me there on the dining room table. And then I realized that her plate was not even halfway empty when she went to the stove.

This happened a few more times. Thinking she wanted her own space (or not my company) I did not really linger around her and just stayed in my room. I was also studying for my graduate school entrance exam which, so I rather use my time to focus on studying since my exam was coming up in a few weeks - late June. Time past far too quickly, and the fear of taking such an important exam would of course fill me with anxiety. Recalling back, I think I spoke to my mother only a handful of times. Taking care of my grandmother took its toll on her, and she often would verbally explode on the next person - most of the time it would be me, since I would be home studying. I just tried to avoid her the entire day, call me superstitious, but I do not want any negative energy so close to my exam. On the day of the exam, I quietly left my house early in the morning since commuting into the city took me a while and I wanted to get there early to calm my nerves. After sitting still for 6-hours and another 2-hour commute home, I came home to my grandmother sitting by herself, just looking out the window. In our culture, after any big event we usually prepare sweets or the person's favorite dish. But I came home to an empty stove, and where was my mother? Downstairs. I heard her come back after a few hours, and ... nothing. She did not ask how my exam was, nor how I was feeling or what I wanted to eat. The stove was empty; the house was quiet and empty afterwards. 

I think it was mid-July when our series of arguments started. It would not start with me, but somehow, I would get roped into it and it would slowly descend into days of me going non-verbal. While I am aware it can be seen as immature and toxic but going non-verbal helps me keep my peace of mind. Whenever I would try to reason with her, I would be met ignorant silence or screaming. And no one would take my side, so I would just keep to myself. After every argument, she would go downstairs and [of course] vent about how I am the worst child imaginable. 

Now we are approaching the end of September, my exam score came back late August. She never bothered to follow up nor ask. Since mid-July, we would have arguments every 1-2 weeks. The most recent being the day before I am writing this post. Then the next day she would ask me to do something for them. No apologies, no resolution nothing - to be clear, it is a pattern. It seems that everything I do bothers her, not only does she get mad at the smallest things, but her stubbornness on equally insignificant actions just doubled. She keeps going downstairs per usual - not more nor less, but always and like clockwork. Even if they are sleeping downstairs, my mother would just go downstairs and wait by their door for a few moments to see if they wake up. 

I am not saying they are doing some evil magic on her. But I have known for my stepfather's family to dabble in things like that. Often times I have come across strange amulets and pieces of hair, each different from the other. The constant whispers that stop when someone is nearby. The stares, toothless grins. The strangers, new house, new environment and new lifestyle. Something is wrong. And something is happening. I can't prove it. Nor can I solve it. But I can recognize patterns, positive correlations and biased results. 

I think my family is cursed.
