By sharing this, I'm breaking solemn vows. Unveiling a closely guarded secret that for centuries dwelled only within the candlelit vaults of the Vatican, behind the sealed lips of the conclave’s highest members. We few who were entrusted with this secret knew its weight. We kept it safe, and in doing so, humankind as well.

But now I’m sharing it. Because at the latter, we’ve failed. Miserably. To hell with vows, now the only way to protect humankind, to protect *you*, is to break them.

The kid at the drive through handed us the cup tray, wide eyed and dumbstruck. Sure, piled in the van, sporting our colorful Zucchettos, flowing cassocks and white collars, we weren’t exactly the crowd he was used to seeing roll through at night.

But it was late, and we needed coffee. Cardinal Bianchi had been driving for hours. His eyes were tired and bloodshot in his perpetually reddened face, and I’m sure I heard him whisper a curse or two under his breath, a side of the old man I'd never seen.

“Keep yourselves awake” he said, handing out the steaming coffees.

“We’re getting close, I can feel it”

The hot coffee almost leaped out of the cup as he thrust it in Father O’Shea’s hands.

“I mean you, O’Shea. God demands a watchful eye!”

Father O’Shea jolted a little, waking from a nap I’m sure he’d try to deny. A white splotch bloomed on his forehead from where it rested on the window.

“Well, I’m sure even *he* needs to rest them occasionally, your Grace”

Bianchi’s side-eye burned in the rearview. As we peeled back onto the road, his gold iPhone barked directions at us. I couldn’t understand much of the Italian text-to-speech but knew in my gut we were drawing closer.

“It feels silly” O’Shea mused. “Coming all this way for a mirror”

“The most profoundly cursed mirror on earth” I reminded him.

“Sure, we’ve gone after haunted dolls, jinxed jewelry, but we never crossed the pond for any of that. What’s with this mirror?”

Bianchi and I exchanged a glance.

“This mirror contains the unholiest of all” he said gravely. “The Devil himself”

“It’s a prison, but not a perfect one” I explained. “All it takes is a glance in this mirror to release the evil inside”.

“Right… when were you going to mention this?”

We just stared straight ahead.

Rolling through one last intersection, the little blue line on Google Maps fizzled to an end.

*Sei arrivato a destinazione*, the iPhone squawked.

The indicator ticked away as Bianchi pulled us over, stopping by some tennis courts. His bloodshot eyes fixed upon me.

“Father Marco, it’s time”.

The door rolled open and we plodded onto the court. The air was cold and still, but in the distance, we heard a low, rhythmic rumbling coming from over the hill. Standing in the white lines of the doubles court, I lay down the leather pouch I carried, slipping the drawstring undone.

The brass censer inside it glowed from within, casting gold diamonds of light across the court. I was told that inside the censer, contained in the heart of that ancient metalwork were the still smoldering ashes of Saint Barnabus, the man who trapped the Devil in the first place. 

I never believed that, not really, until I held the thing aloft and released the puff of smoke into the night sky. We watched it tumble and warp like a golden breath as it drifted along, guiding our eyes.

“The Saint’s ashes seek his handiwork” I said. “We have to follow it”.

We watched as the smoke wafted its way over powerlines, rooftops, then vanished above the trees.

“It went over that hill” Bianchi screwed up his eyes into pits, tracing its path. “*Andiamo!*”

We piled back into the van and swung through a roundabout. The hill was so steep that the Cardinal had to fight the gears, the van protesting the entire way.

Lavish Mcmansions with tall rolling gates and kidney-shaped pools sprouted on either side of us. The growing noise gnawed through the glass, pounding, booming. At the top of the hill, sickly green light spilled over the crest in an unearthly halo.

O’Shea squinted.

“Jesus, that can’t be good. Did he escape already? Has he already been freed?”

Bianchi gripped the wheel like it would break in two.

“Whatever’s behind this hill, is where the Devil waits to walk free”

Our eyes were glued to the windshield as the van struggled to the top.

On the other side, we saw it.

The mansion was a monstrosity. It was four stories tall, overflowing with decks and clustered with glowing windows. It lit up the night like a beacon, colored strobes and lasers spewed from every window, and vivid spotlights on the lawn swept the sky like they were searching for bombers.

Clouds of smoke from a machine billowed out from every opening. Booming EDM thundered outwards in waves, breaking the Richter scale. College kids were everywhere. Countless pairs of sneakers churned up the lawn, stuffed the balconies until they bowed with the weight. There were hundreds of them.

Bianchi dropped his forehead to the wheel. “Cazzo...”.

“How many of the little bastards do you think there are?” O’Shea asked.

“It doesn’t matter" the Cardinal palmed the air. "Someone down there has the mirror, we have to find them befo-“

“There!” I jabbed my finger at the windshield.

At the mansion’s base, a row of small basement windows blinked in the dark. Then they blew out. Glass shattered, and an unnatural green fire rolled up the brickwork like a breath from hell itself, before shrinking back. The lightshow went on, none of the kids even turning their heads.

Bianchi threw the van into gear. “He’s here. We’re crashing this party”.

We parked at the end of the street, and O’Shea cracked his knuckles. He got to work hauling his pet project out the back doors. It looked like the spotlight you use to summon Batman. He hooked up cables, adjusted giant lenses, and the rig whirred to life. Then came the light. Sharp, golden crucifixes burst from the lenses, casting themselves across the mansion’s facade. They shimmered over the windows and doors, some of them dancing across the smoke clouds and stretching into the third dimension. As they melded with the strobe lights, it looked like some strange, holy rave.

“Consider it sealed” he told us.

We crossed ourselves and stepped onto the lawn. It was like a battlefield. People lay passed out on the grass, pools of puke trailing from their mouths like speech bubbles. Two guys with ponytails wrestled on the ground, lit up by a circle of recording phones. Red solo cups crushed under our feet like landmines.

“What’s that on the roof?”

“Uhm… a Kiddie pool”

We reached the front door, which hung wide open, letting a deafening wave of EDM crash into the night. Our teeth rattled in our skulls as we entered the chaos inside. Bianchi looked at me, gesturing with velvet-gloved hands. *Pull the plug*.

I found the DJ both, and after exchanging some screams with the kid behind the glowing mixers, the music shut off.

An ocean of dazed eyes turned towards us. Bianchi took the floor, parting the swarm of drunken kids like the red sea. He raised his hands in the air, commanding all to pay attention.

“Children! You must stop and you must listen! The Devil himself walks amongst you!”

For a moment there was silence. Then some kid in the back started giggling.

Hguah, Hguah, Hguah.

It spread into some low chuckles at the back, then rolled forward as cackles and snickers sprang from amongst the crowd. Pretty soon the whole house was howling at us.

“Who are these freaks?”

“Just strip already!”

The music spun back on. Biachi stormed amongst the crowd, his fuming red face inches from the laughing frat bros, finger stabbing the air. I couldn’t hear what he was yelling, but didn’t need to.

O’Shea and I tried in vain to get some answers.

“The mirror! Who has the mirror!”

We lost their attention fast, it was looking hopeless. But then I felt a tug on my sleeve. A tiny, brown-haired girl was looking up at me, thick glasses guarding worried eyes.

“Excuse me… you guys really are priests, right? You’re not just in fancy dress… or strippers… or something?”

“Yes, we’re from the Vatican” I told her. “We came here for a very dangerous artifact”.

“My friends… they were messing around with something weird... an old mirror. They took it in the basement and I haven’t seen them since”.

“Show us”.

\----

The basement was carpeted with ash. Shelves were knocked over, tools and boxes tossed around, but it was somehow less chaotic than the scene above. Sitting like a centerpiece in the destruction was a small, oval hand-mirror with an ebony handle, the kind an 18th-century aristocrat might use to straighten their wig. The colored lights from outside danced on its dark surface.

“Is *that* really what we’re after?” O’Shea scoffed as he made to pick it up. “It's bloody tiny!”

 Bianchi stopped him with a palm. “Don’t touch it. Don’t gaze upon it”

He pulled a silk handkerchief from his cassock and cast it over the mirror. Wrapping it tight in the silk, he held it cautiously in his fingertips.

“You said your friends had this? Who?”

The girl cleared her throat meekly.

“Uhm… Jennifer brought it over, with an old leather book… said it was haunted. A whole bunch of them took it down here, they wanted to play a game like Bloody Mary”

Bianchi’s eyes were pinpricks. “This mirror was a prison. The Devil himself was sealed inside its glass, trapped by his own vanity. But if one your friends has gazed too deeply, spoken careless words they don’t understand, then the Devil now walks in their footsteps”

“Any of your rich kid friends fluent in Latin by any chance?” O’Shea asked.

“Jennifer took AP Latin”

We looked at each other with wide eyes.

“Find her for us” Bianchi commanded. “But I need you to be careful. We’ll keep searching above, the Devil in his deceit could have possessed any one of them”.

We crept back upstairs. The music pounded our eardrums to the point of splitting. The colored lights pulsed hypnotically. In the flashes, it was impossible to make out individuals, just a swarm of teeth, glowsticks and sweat. We squinted helplessly, chilled by the thought that somewhere amongst this chaos, through drunken, bloodshot eyes, true evil was watching us back.

“This is a nightmare!” O’Shea yelled in my ear. “Dancing! Drugs! Drunken debauchery! Who could spot the Devil in this?"

As we split up to begin our search, I drummed my fingers on my bronze crucifix. The feel of its weight around my neck was usually a comfort, but there, in the lights and the smoke, it felt like nothing more than a target.
