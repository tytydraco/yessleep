You open your eyes, and the first thing you feel is stillness. The second thing is pink.

You’re standing on a gravel driveway, in the middle of nowhere. There are no landmarks. No trees. No sky movement. Just a pale, empty horizon stretching forever in every direction. The ground under your feet crunches when you shift your weight, but there’s no echo. No breeze. No birds.

Only the sound of your own breath.

And the house.

It sits in front of you, alone in the blank landscape. It's two stories and coated in a strange, faded pink. The color is warm and cold at the same time—like a childhood birthday cake left out too long, like chewing gum found in your pocket from when you were seven. Its windows are black, too black, like empty eye sockets. The curtains don’t move.

You know instinctively that this place is not right.

But still… you step forward.

The porch groans under your feet. It feels alive. The front door is ajar, swinging gently. Not from the wind—because there is no wind—but like it’s been waiting for you. You hesitate at the threshold, and for a second, the hum begins.

Low, vibrating. Like an old CRT television. Frozen in time.

You step inside.

The wallpaper is pink, but the pattern is subtle—roses, over and over again, so small they look like static. The hallway is impossibly long, stretching beyond logic, with dim yellow light that comes from nowhere.

The carpet is thick and soft, almost too soft, like walking on velvet that’s been soaked and dried too many times. Everything smells faintly of sugar and mildew.

The kitchen is to your left. You didn’t know that, but you know that. It’s always been to the left.

Inside, the lights are on. A plate of pancakes sits at a place setting. Steam curls up into the air, slow and dreamlike. The syrup never drips. It just shines. There’s a chair waiting for you. On the fridge, a yellow sticky note in looping cursive reads:

"You must be hungry. It’s okay to eat. You’ll need your strength for the stairs."

The handwriting looks like yours. But off. Like someone pretending to be you.

Still, you sit. You eat.

The pancakes taste like childhood. Like Saturday mornings with cartoons you can’t name. A day at grandmothers house. Like warmth in your stomach and the sound of rain on the roof. Your throat tightens. You feel tears threaten, but you don’t know why.

You do not question the food.

You are starting to remember things that never happened.

Remember when you played with your ginger cat named Olivia, outside your home?

But you don't have a cat, you have never had a cat. Only a dog named Honey. 

The hallway changes when you leave the kitchen. There are doors now. Too many. Some closed, some open just enough to see darkness beyond. You hear whispers, muffled conversations in rooms that don’t exist. The carpet becomes plush again. It swallows your footsteps.

One door on your right is wide open. Inside is a nursery. A crib. A music box playing a tune almost familiar—just a few notes off. Above the crib spins a mobile with miniature pink houses. They rotate slowly, but the air in the room is still.

On the wall, a photograph. You, as a child. Maybe six. But you’re not smiling. You’re looking just past the camera, eyes unfocused, as though hearing something no one else could.

You stare at it for too long.

When you turn around, the hallway is different.

Shorter.

Darker.

Closer.

The next room is a living room. Your grandparents' living room, but wrong. Too clean. Too bright. There’s no dust on the mantel. The TV is on, playing static with subtitles that don’t match the noise.

On the couch, someone wrapped in a pink sleeping beauty dress.

You know immediately it’s you.

Or... used to be.

They don’t look at you right away. When they do, their eyes are sockets,  like doll eyes, but they soften when they recognize you.

“You’re late,” they say. “The house has been waiting.”

You try to speak, but your voice doesn’t work. The other you, pink blanket they pats the cushion beside them.

You sit.

A staircase forms up, and she disappeared.

The stairs lead upward, but not like normal stairs. They stretch, curve, loop. The pink carpet on the steps shifts underfoot, like walking on muscle.

Each step makes the hum louder.

You pass by pictures lining the stairwell. Each one is you in front of this house—but always different. A different outfit. A different expression. One version is holding hands with someone you don’t know. Another has no face.

One picture is cracked. In it, your reflection stands behind glass, pressing its palms against it, eyes wide and begging.

You keep going.

At the top of the stairs, there's one final door.

Pink.

Pulsing.

Warm.

You open it.

It’s a bedroom. Everything in it is soft and pink and glowing faintly, like it was made from the inside of a seashell. The bed is perfectly made. There’s a stuffed animal on the pillow. A rabbit with no eyes.

The hum is loudest here, but no longer oppressive. It’s like being inside a heartbeat. The walls shift slightly, like lungs.

There’s a note on the bed:

“You can rest now. You remembered enough.”

Your legs feel heavy. Your chest feels light.

You lay down.

The bed cradles you.

The ceiling pulses gently, like it’s watching over you.

The house is breathing with you. Not in sync—but just enough that it feels like it’s learning you. Adapting. Waiting for the right rhythm.

As your eyes close, you hear your own voice right beside your ear.

“You came back. We missed you.”

The last thing you see is the pink light dimming, like a curtain slowly closing.

You are not awake.
You are not asleep.

You are in the house.

And the house is in you.

And somewhere, in the middle of nowhere, the door swings open again

Waiting for someone else to come home.
