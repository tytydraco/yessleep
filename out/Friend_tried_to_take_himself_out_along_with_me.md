I recently got into a car accident about 2 weeks ago.

There was this kid i had been hanging out with for a few weeks before this, didn’t know him well but he was funny as fuck and had a way of being able to socialize with just about anyone. I consider myself a pretty sociable person but this guy wasn’t shy to go up to anyone, and i think that’s why we became somewhat close. He had what I didn’t and vice versa

After a few weeks of hanging out with him I could tell that he had some bad adhd and slight bipolar issues.

We’d have a lot of deep conversations about life, some intellectual, some about business and other times it was more personal. However I can tell he was going through a lot. I could tell there was a suicidal demon lurking in him. 

He had a good way of putting up a smile but would flip like a switch sometimes and go from laughing to crying out of nowhere. Seems like some traumatic type of flashback.

I ended up taking him to church for a few weeks in hopes he can open his heart to hear the lords word speak to him. It seemed like there was some real healing going on. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, he asks me around 1am if I wanted to hang out. I said sure. We’re both pretty ambitious restless types so 1am on a Tuesday wasn’t unusual for me to be out but I had a weird feeling the moment I got into the car.

He had asked me to put my phone down and on airplane mode and told me that “we are going for a drive”. I don’t know what my thought process was when he told me that. I was oblivious. 

My memory from here is blurry but I was only in the car for maybe a total of 2 min before he drove straight into a tree on the *right* side of the road… i was on the right passenger side. Luckily we missed the tree just enough for us to flip on our side and then upside down, instead of head on. 

He went into a state of pure panic disoriented, screaming “im going to die” over and over. We were upside down with smoke fumes quickly filling the car. My adrenaline kicked in and i unbuckled our seatbelts and dragged him out of the car, having to kick open the smashed in door. 

Neighbors come outside, ems and police come fairly quickly and asses the damage. My friend is having a complete breakdown in front of everyone. His mom and aunt end up coming to pick us up and drop me back off home.

He sends me multiple text a few hours later about how I need to stay away from him  and that he is a horrible person etc etc. I check his location and he ended up in the hospital by 9am. 

2 days later he ended up going to some mental health facility in another state and has been there since. I talked to his mom and he confessed to wanting to end his life that night… I don’t even know what to think, like im laughing as a way of coping because that was almost game over for me.

I open my heart to people that believe I can help them but in doing that i almost got myself killed.
I truly believe god was watching over me that night.

The car is totalled, probably in some junk yard. I have some scratches on my elbows and knees and my collarbone is a bit bruised but I haven’t yet gotten checked out. I probably need to.

Anyways, ive never spooked myself like this but I take everything as a lesson to be learned. I believe the devil uses people to accomplish its goals and that faith is the only reason why im still here writing this.
