Have you ever felt like your body isn’t yours? Not just wrong—but unfamiliar, like something borrowed, altered when you weren’t looking? I know how that sounds. But I swear to you, I’m not crazy.

I should clarify, I'm not suffering from dysphoria of any sort, I swear it. I know how it's going to sound, but I'm \*not\*, no matter how much everyone around me says it is. Says I've always been this way. I haven't been, I know this. I \*know\* this. A week ago I was fine, I was perfectly ordinary.

Five days ago, that's when everything changed for me. I'd been at work - I work as a cashier at a small bookstore here in town - and I'd been shelving new books we'd gotten in. I distinctly remember that, because I remember reading the title of one, and making a mental note to have a look at it for myself later.

One moment, I was shelving books, running my fingers over the smooth spines. The next—a cut in the film reel of my life—I was in my boss’s office, nodding along as she rattled off event ideas. No transition. No memory of walking there. Just here now, without the in-between.

When I asked her what was going on, she was irritated at first. I think she thought I'd been ignoring her, maybe? When I pressed, though, and she saw how freaked out I was, that's when she got worried, so much so that she sent me home early with instructions to get checked out at the ER.

So that's what I did. On the way there, I called my neighbors, asking them to feed my cat and letting them know where the spare key was—they were fine with it—and then I waited in the waiting room.

I had plenty of time to sit and overanalyze. My hands fidgeted—rubbing my thumb over my pinky like I always do when I’m nervous. Something felt off. A slight wrongness. A texture that shouldn’t be there.

I looked down.

The nail was gone.

Not torn off. Not injured. Just… never there. Scarred over, like it had been gone for years.

I know for a fact, an \*absolute\* fact that I had a pinky nail this morning, so that was immediately added to my list of things to freak out about.

When I was finally escorted back to a room everything went speedier from there. It wasn't more than thirty minutes before the doctor came to see me. I'd listed the black out and memory loss as a reason for coming during intake, but now I had the missing pinky nail to add to the pile, and add it I did.

The doctor was very kind, quick to reassure me that sometimes people just had memory lapses, that it was quite common, but he still scheduled a few tests for me. I no nothing about medical science, so I can't really say what any of them did, or were for. I had blood drawn, I was put through a tube and scanned, I think x rays were done? I'm not entirely sure about that last one. I want to say it happened, but there was never any mention of it when I finally got back to my room.

The other tests came back clean, healthy I suppose. The doctor certainly didn't seem concerned. He did mention something that made no sense. He informed that in my medical records it was noted that I was, in fact, missing my pinky nail. That I'd been born like that. But that can't be right. I mean, I don't look at my hands constantly, but I know I had all of my fingernails this morning. I told the doctor just that, and he looked at me like...well like I was crazy, and he felt bad for me being crazy.

That was when I decided to just go home, the tests were fine and did nothing to help me, so what was the point of even staying there. The doctor still insisted on me scheduling an appointment with a therapist, and I made all the right noises about it before I left.

When I got into my car, I checked the mirror on instinct. The backseat was empty—no missing time, no gaps. Just me.

Except.

My eyes weren’t green.

They weren’t bloodshot or tired or glassy. They were brown. A flat, unremarkable, cardboard brown. No trace of green, no hint they had ever been anything else.

But I remember.

I remember looking at my reflection this morning, and my eyes were green. I know they were green. Weren’t they?

It was late when I got home, way too late to be bugging my neighbor, so I just headed into my apartment. The first thing I noticed was the quiet. Normally when I come home I'll hear the jingle of my cats, Sofi, collar as she runs my way to say hello. This time, nothing. Just empty silence. When I turned on the lights one room after another, I kept calling for her and looking behind anything I could think of, but she wasn't there, neither were her toys, her litter box, nothing. There wasn't even any fur on the couch. It was like she'd never been there.

Of course I woke up my neighbor, my fucking cat was missing. I pounded on their door until they answered, and when I started making demands, asking about my cat, my key, everything, they just looked at me like I was insane. Threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave. They had no idea what I was talking about.

I opened up my phone log to prove to them that we'd talked, but there was nothing. Calls from my mom, a few spam calls, a call from my boss, but nothing to or from my neighbor. I remember feeling panicked, so fucking scared, and then the next moment - like I had been ripped out of one scene in my life, and stuffed awkwardly into another - I was back in my apartment. Sitting at my kitchen table, with a bowl of cereal in front of me.

I'm here now, typing this out. I don't understand what's happening to me, to my memory. But I'm terrified of the idea of what I might lose next.
