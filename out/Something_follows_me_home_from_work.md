I had just moved out of my parents place into this new apartment closer to work, it's a little small but it was the only one I could afford. It's close enough to my work place so I can just walk there. My mother had surprised me with a calico cat the day I moved out, so I can say I felt very safe at the time. I've never had any experiences with stalkers since my parents always overprotected me from anything and anyone. The neighborhood I moved into isn't the safest, so I bought myself one of those self defense kits that come with pepperspray and a blade that turns into a key. Well I didn't want it at first but my father forced me to buy one because ''You're a woman''. 

My first walk to work went well, kind of a shame that I didn't get to use my pepperspray. I felt safe until my walk home from work, right as my shift ended and I started walking home, I felt like I was being watched. I thought maybe a co-worker wanted to walk home with me and was catching up to me, but no one came. I turned a corner and saw someone staring at me, he didn't exactly look human, there was something off about him. He was wearing all black, had wide cat like eyes that were watching me, and he had a wide grin. If it weren't for the fact that there was a dark alleyway behind him and I was all alone, he wouldn't have looked as creepy as he did. I didn't want to take out the pepperspray since he wasn't harming me, so I continued walking. I was waiting for him to start following me, but he stayed completely still, only his eyes were following me. I turned another corner and ran home right as I got rid of him. As I got home, I didn't think anything of it, maybe he was just some homeless person, but I couldn't get those piercing black eyes out of my head, like if he knew every little secret I had. I tried getting my mind off that guy so I started cooking dinner and then went to bed. 

The next day was the same as the last one, I went to work, and started walking home after my shift ended. Except, today I saw the man somewhere else. Yesterday I saw him almost immediately after walking out of the building, but this time he was a block away, standing there just like before, staring at me again. I ignored him and didn't stop to look back at him. I called my mother as soon as I got home and told her about him. She suggested calling the police but he didn't harm or threaten me so I declined. She said if it kept happening that I should consider moving back in with them, I noticed that she was getting too worried so I changed the subject and hung up after a while. That night I went online and started browsing through security cameras, I didn't buy any since I thought I was just being paranoid so I went to bed. 

It's been 4 days and nothing has changed. I see him every time, except I realized that he's getting closer and closer to my apartment. I haven't been able to sleep, I keep dreaming about him,in one dream he was standing outside my window watching me sleep and in another one he was watching me outside my bedroom door. I haven't come across him lately so I think he finally went away. As I'm typing this, I'm starting to calm down a little, besides those dreams, I feel safe. There's only one weird thing going on, my cat keeps hissing and meowing at the bottom of my bed. She is very vocal so maybe she just sees bugs under there or something. But whatever it is, I feel much better after getting this off my chest.
