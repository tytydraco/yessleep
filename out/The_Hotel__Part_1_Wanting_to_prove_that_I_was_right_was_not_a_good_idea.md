I'm the kind of person who takes notes on everything. I make Post-its to excess. I have the "Notepad" app on my smartphone filled with hundreds of different notes, ranging from shopping lists to appointment dates, ideas that have crossed my mind or reflections on life. It helps me to be better organized, but above all to better understand the world around me. That's why I took notes of everything below. A habit.   

I'm pessimistic, according to those around me, and arrogant at times. I don't believe in or care about anything special. I'm boring inside. Outwardly, I try to appear different, more interested, more sociable. I think I've learned that it's important to be surrounded, even though I don't feel the need for others. Don't think I like being like this; I'm just like that, and I don't know why.  

Perhaps because I didn't receive any signs of affection or interest in me during childhood.   

That's probably what a psychologist would say. My parents weren't abusive or neglectful, just empty, like me, I imagine.   

I did manage to make a group of friends, though. I was lucky, I think, because they support and accept me as I am. I'm a pretty down-to-earth, stoic person, and my strongest, most energetically expressed trait is that I like to be right. I really do. So when she asked me to come with her to see who was right and who was wrong, I didn't hesitate.  

I don't want to forget anything about this moment or my future stay at the supposedly haunted hotel, so I'm taking notes now. I hope I can then prove to them that I was right. Of course, I intend to be completely honest; my friends know how much I hate lying.  

That ordinary Saturday night, we were all gathered in my downtown apartment, with alcohol, cigarettes, and pizza. We discussed everything and nothing, the latest gossip, TV series, movies, and video games coming out this year. In short, it was a classic discussion among a group of 25-year-old friends. Our group is entirely made up of childhood friends; we've all known each other since elementary school. I'm aware of this luck. We have a lot in common, but we also have different personalities and tastes: a diverse group, in short. We've known each other for so long that an argument isn't the end, a disagreement doesn't end in a fight, and support and a listening ear are always present. An environment where, with an effort, I manage to fit in. 

Mia loves anything paranormal. She enjoys researching the subject, and again, it's a topic I don't subscribe to. She began telling us about a strange hotel about a three-hour drive from our home. This hotel is reportedly in a remote area, has little to no advertising, and doesn't appear on online booking sites.   

Mia's discovery began with a video on social media, where a couple talked about this hotel and said they had strange experiences there. She then searched for the video to show us.  

On the screen, we saw a tired and agitated couple, explaining in a panicked voice that they had stumbled upon this hotel by chance during their road trip. They spent only one night there and claim to have experienced inexplicable and terrifying events. They say no more; they seem to want to alert their communities, forget this experience, and above all leave quickly. The video is rather short and is filmed from inside what appears to be a van. A silent shot shows the hotel for a few seconds, long enough to see the name: "\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*" The scene ends with a close-up of the woman, her eyes bulging with anguish, saying, "Don't come here," then the video cuts.  

Mia, all excited, asked us what we thought. Everyone said it sounded interesting and scary, but there was too little information. It was difficult to judge whether it was a hoax or a real video. Mia, however, was convinced of its veracity. She argued.  

\- *“The hotel really exists, I managed to find its website in the depths of the web. The couple seems authentic and genuinely uncomfortable. I'm sure there must be paranormal phenomena there. Real ones!”* 

I was about to protest when she raised a finger in the air to avoid being interrupted. She leaned towards us, completely ecstatic.  

*-“I researched the news surrounding the hotel.”*  

She paused, to mark the suspense.  

*-“A traveling couple disappeared after leaving a van stuck in a tree along the road. The vehicle was reported the day after the video. This couple hasn't posted anything since, and the photos from the wanted posters show that it is indeed the same couple! All their personal belongings and smartphones were in the van, but they had disappeared without a trace!”*  

Pleased with these arguments, she sat up in her chair and took a triumphant pause.  

*-“It’s certainly strange, this… coincidence, if it is one.”* John hesitated, afraid of offending her.  

*“It’s not a coincidence!”* she protested.  

Anne and Sam, the only couple in our group, agreed that if it was a coincidence, it was definitely suspicious. They also agreed that the couple in the video looked really scared. Anne spoke for both of them, looking for Sam's approval of what she was saying. The debate was on.  

*-“It’s a shame we can’t find out more about what happened. Was it paranormal? Was it just an unfortunate coincidence? There’s no way we can know, but even though the timing of their accidents is really strange, I hope we’ll find out one day what happened to them.”*  

That's when I finally intervened with my legendary tact.   

*-“Okay, that's going a bit far, isn't it? Don't you just think this is some kind of "set-up" and fake news to give visibility to this hotel? Or even for this couple to create a buzz? Or even the start of an ARG? It's so trendy. You said it yourself, Mia! The hotel is hard to find online and isn't on online booking sites, right? It's possible it doesn't even exist! Maybe it's to create a hidden ad, like a haunted hotel to attract adventurous customers. The couple, actors, the Van, a set-up. Doesn't that seem more logical and realistic to you than paranormal stories? Stay grounded, guys, now with social media, AI and other software, it's easy to create whatever you want. It's just buzz! Clickbait!”* 

 

After my super disapproving speech, there was an accusatory silence. I should have kept my mouth shut. Mia sulked, sunk in her seat. John relit his cigarette, took a few drags, then passed it to Sam. Anne finally broke the silence.  

*-“You know Alec…”*   

I learned a life lesson.   

*-“You should really think about being more open-minded. I’m not saying your version of events isn’t plausible—it is. But you shouldn’t speak so authoritatively and impose your ideas so harshly, because you also don’t really know what happened or what’s going on in this hotel. No one in this room does. Everyone has the right to think what they want. Prevarication or keeping an open mind isn’t always a bad thing.”* 

She was right, I knew it, but I'm stubborn, too much, really too much.  

*-“What you say is absolutely true, but I think I'm the one who's closest to the truth. That's all.”*  

  

*-"You always want to be right. It's really annoying about you. If you didn't have other qualities, we wouldn't have been friends for a long time. Talking to you is difficult; you don't let others think freely."* 

Mia had stung my ego, I felt like a real jerk. She added this sentence, which triggered my current situation.  

  

*-“No matter how close you feel to reality, you know nothing about what's going on there. So you can't be right. You have no proof, your words are no more valuable than ours. Do you want to prove that you're right? Then come with me there!”* 

  

I hate it when people question my logic and show me I'm wrong. My only response to these words was not to tell her she was right in her reasoning and leave it at that, but to talk her down and respond.  

*-“All right, I’ll go to that hotel. I’ll prove to you that nothing special is happening there and that it was just hype! Give me the hotel’s website so I can book!”*  

Damn! I'm such a mental case! I should learn to shut up. I naively thought she'd tell me it wasn't necessary to do so much. But she didn't, and I found myself trapped by my own misplaced ego.  

I went to the hotel's website, and before booking, I looked at the information provided. Reading the history, I could see that this hotel has been around since the 1800s, which is no small feat. The photos show that it is well maintained despite its 225 years. You are promised a quiet and discreet stay, and a service that does everything possible to meet all the requests of its guests. "All" being underlined in the text. A hotel where men bring call girls or girlfriends without their wives' knowledge. That's what I thought.  

There was a small text at the very bottom of the page, stating that the hotel was haunted, and that several guests, staff members, and others had observed paranormal phenomena. If this was their strategy to attract more guests, or even TV shows or influencers, indicating paranormal phenomena in the hotel at the very bottom of the history page was probably not the best marketing approach. I looked at Mia and showed her the text.  

*-“You saw that, didn’t you? You found on the website that it was supposedly haunted, is that why you’re convinced of it?”*  

  

*-"What are you talking about ? "*  

She took the phone from my hand, looking surprised, and looked at the screen carefully.  

*-“It wasn't indicated when I browsed the page. Did I miss it? It's both weird and even more interesting. I can't wait. Get a room for two, you never know, it might be better not to leave each other.*  

Mia and I are like cat and dog, never agreeing on anything, but it's with her that I have the most interesting debates. Even if for me her vision of the world is too fantastical. She always tells me these stories, yet she knows I'm going to contradict her. During this stay, I'm going to have to think about her safety as well as my own.  

*-“What if something happens to you?”*  

*-“I will be with you, I fear nothing.”*  

  

I'm flattered by her trust in me, but I don't deserve it.  

*-“I will protect you of course, but…”*   

*-“Sorry Alec, it’s not negotiable!”*  

This is how I ended up with a weekend plan for a one-on-one with Mia.  

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today is the big departure. We took Friday afternoon off from work to go away for the weekend. It's only a three-hour drive, so it'll be over quickly. The suitcases are loaded in the trunk; most of them belong to Mia. She brought three suitcases for two nights at the hotel; I wonder why she needs all that. I took a simple overnight bag, with a change of clothes and a toiletry bag.   

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had some difficulty finding the hotel. The GPS had led us to a remote road, crossing a dark forest. There was nothing in front of us but a long road that disappeared into the horizon, deserted, the same thing awaited us behind. The forest surrounding us was very dense and stretched far into the heights, hiding us from the sunlight. It was so thick that it was impossible to see through the trees. The place was stifling, the silence heavy, not a single wisp of wind brushed the foliage of the trees. We truly felt like we were nowhere, as if in a loop where the landscape remained the same and never ended. This idea was oppressive. We stopped in the middle of the road to think about what we were going to do. We discussed the options we had, but there weren't many.    

\-- Turn around and go home  

\-- Called the hotel to ask how to find it, but we already didn't know how to explain where we were.  

\-- Continue on the road a little further to see if we find any indication.  

Of course, we chose to continue on our way. After about twenty minutes of this repetitive landscape, we finally spotted a small sign hidden by the tall grass at the beginning of a path leading into the forest. It pointed us in the right direction, with a red arrow whose paint was chipped and faded, with the hotel's name written below it, in small black letters. Between their unattractive websites, their lack of communication regarding reservations, and this small, dilapidated sign, this establishment looked like it didn't want to be found.  

  

After taking a road with several bends that climbed ever higher into the forest, it was a surprise to see so many people in the parking lot upon our arrival. We thought we'd find a quiet spot, perhaps even be the only guests, but we were wrong. The hotel was a large, three-story establishment, perfectly maintained; the large brick walls and rosewood-colored roof were like new. The parking lot was very large and paved, with flowering plants adorning its perimeter and making it look elegant.  

Who would have thought that such a beautiful building could be found in such a remote location? It was at the foot of a mountain, the space was wide open, and the sun shone on the building. It was like a circle of light amidst the darkness that surrounded it. We saw a tennis court in the distance, as well as a swimming pool. We hadn't paid much for our stay, and we began to wonder if we had chosen the wrong hotel; the standard here was too high for the price.  

We grabbed our things—or rather, I grabbed my bag and some of Mia's suitcases—and headed toward the entrance. It was topped with a large, very chic, varnished wooden arch. An employee greeted us very politely and opened the large wooden door. The lobby was very large, very bright, with a huge round chandelier on the ceiling that looked like it was made of crystals. In this wide lobby, there were several areas where brown leather chairs were grouped together to form various small lounges, with carved wooden tables that looked expensive. Frescoes on the walls depicted passages from mythological stories, at first glance, and an off-white tile floor with a gigantic pattern in the center made of red mosaic. No idea what it meant or represented. It was impressive.  

The reception desk is at the end of the hall, so we headed towards the employee there. A tall man, I'd say in his fifties, wearing a very classy black suit and a small white handkerchief sticking out of his front pocket.

 

*-“Miss, Sir, Welcome to “\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*”, do you have a reservation?”*  

I took out the printed sheet from the internet reservation and handed it to him.  

*-“Hello, yes of course, here it is.”*  

  

*-" Thank you."*  

He looked at the document and searched his ledger, a large, old-fashioned paper diary. I hadn't noticed before that there were no computers here. He continued.  

*-“I found you, sir. It seems this is your first stay with us. A room for two people, is that right?”*   

  

*-"Indeed."*  

  

The butler took a binder out from under the counter and began searching inside, chatting with Mia as she searched. I stood aside; she didn't need me for this simple task. She was also better at socializing than I was; I tended to speak in a tone that people considered "passive-aggressive." I never feel that way, but it seems, according to my friends, that I'm constantly on the defensive. So I let others speak for me whenever I can.  

*-“Could you tell me how you found our hotel? Was it recommended to you by one of our “special clients”? If so, please provide me with their referral number and code name.*  

The conversation was starting to get weird, so I listened a little more closely; it was a strange request. Mia seemed taken aback and stammered a little.  

*-“Uh… No, I found you on the internet, I found your site.”*  

The man looked her up and down, she hesitated to continue.  

*“Really?”* he wondered. *“We’re not really active on the internet, we’re more old-school. Finding our site isn’t easy when you don’t know about the hotel beforehand. We rely more on word of mouth and referrals. You see.”*  

  

*-“In all honesty, we came for the paranormal events that apparently occur at your hotel. I've been doing a lot of research on this topic, and I landed on your website. A small sentence on it indicates that it's haunted.”*  

  

\- *"I see."* A silence fell for a few seconds after these words. He observed us both. *- "You are... my first 'ghost hunters.'"*  

A slight grimace twisted his face at these words. It seemed that this kind of subject was beyond his intellect and usual language.  

I finally intervened. I was tired of waiting. I wanted to go to our room and finally put our suitcases down. I also didn't like that this man was starting to talk down to us. I approached the counter.  

*-“Excuse me, could you just give us the key and point us in the direction of our room please?”*  

Mia nudged me in the ribs. I reacted immediately.  

*-“What? I said, “Excuse me and please!”*  

She whispered to me as quietly as she could.  

*-"Stop, you know the problem isn't what you say, but how you say it."*  

I didn't answer, nothing.   

He took two documents out of his binder and placed one in front of each of us. Both documents were identical. It read:   

***– Regulations and exemptions of the hotel \*\*\*\*\*\* –***  

Mia and I looked at the documents, then looked at each other. Baffled.  

She spoke without taking her eyes off the document.  

*-"What is this ?"*   

  

*-“The hotel rules are a formality. You are new guests, so in order to stay, you must read and sign them. We will keep them for our records, in case you wish to return one day after your stay. As soon as that is done, I will give you your key.”*  

We signed. Without reading it first... Obviously... We were tired and just wanted to settle into our room. After signing, the man searched the key rack behind him, took one, placed it on the counter, and gently pushed it towards us.  

*-“You will find your room on the third floor in the right wing, take the blue elevator next to the stairs.”*  

He pointed us in the direction with his hand, covered with a spotless white glove. I hadn't noticed that there were two staircases leading to the first floors, one on each side. Everything is so symmetrical in this place: the forest surrounding the road, the building itself with its perfectly centered door, the chandelier exactly in the center of the ceiling, the small lobby lounges in equal numbers on either side of the main walkway. The owner of this establishment seems to be a perfectionist. Perfection makes me uneasy.   

The butler gave us one last piece of information.  

*-“You will find a copy of the document you just signed in your room. It is really necessary to know the rules and not forget them. Have a nice stay.”*  

Once in our room, I was almost disappointed. There was still that unsettling symmetry, but it was very simple, unlike all the chic and class we'd seen so far. A large bed covered in a royal blue bedspread, two square pillows, two identical nightstands. A simple bathroom. No television, and a mirror on the wall opposite the bed, large enough to see the entire reflection of the room. The window overlooked the hotel parking lot, which was filled with cars, but we didn't see anyone in the lobby, the parking lot, or the hallways. 

The copy of the document was lying on one of the bedside tables. I suggested Mia read it before doing anything else. She agreed, so we sat down and began to take a closer look at what we had signed.  

I'm not going to rewrite the letter here, but in summary, it said that we had read the rules and agreed that the hotel would not be held responsible for anything that might happen to us inside or outside. From simple to extremely serious injuries, mutilations, death. We were both a little uneasy and regret not having read anything beforehand. Although I'm not sure we would have turned back for that. I said to Mia:  

*-“Mutilations and death? Just that? It’s ridiculous! They probably give this paper to scare the visitor and immerse them even more in their haunted hotel stories.”*

  

I threw the document on the bed. Mia grabbed it and examined it.  

*-“I don’t know, maybe you’re right, but when you think about the couple in the video, their accidents and disappearances, I imagine they prefer to protect themselves even if it makes them look like they’re exaggerating.”*   

She continued to stare at the document and reread it, while I huffed in annoyance.   

*-“It’s definitely nonsense. It’s just a hotel. There’s nothing strange or creepy about it, it’s actually very popular.”*   

  

*-“That's true, it surprised me too. I didn't expect so many customers in a place that's so hard to find and so poorly advertised. You might be right.*  

I began to rejoice inwardly. I'm right! It can't be otherwise.    

*-"But…"*   

She continued…    

*-“Oh no! Don’t do that! No buts!”*    

I fell limply onto the bed, arms outstretched, and pouted like a child. Mia laughed when she saw me so discouraged by these words and continued.  

  

*-“There’s this whole “special guest” and sponsorship thing, it’s a bit weird for a hotel, it reminds me more of a closed club. There are also these rules… They’re still strange. They shouldn’t be there for decoration, right?”*  

  

*-“Okay, come on, read me these rules!”*  

  

*-“Hmm… so apparently rule number 1 is that you can’t leave your room between midnight and 6 a.m.”*   

  

*-“Okay, it’s a bit restrictive, but it’s a pretty simplistic rule, right? Maybe it’s just to make the night shift easier.”*  

  

*-“Yes, maybe… The next one is more special. It says: No. 2: If you come across the woman wearing a cape with a large white hood in the corridor, whatever the time, be discreet, do not speak to her, do not move, do not attract her attention. If you are facing her, lower your head and do not look at her. Wait for her to pass.”*  

  

That's really weird, I guess it's to give the idea that there's a ghost of a white lady walking around. So classic!  

  

Mia was engrossed in her reading, I could see in her eyes that she was intrigued by these rules and that she was already imagining herself living these events.    

  

*“There is another rule about this White Lady: No. 3 If her cloak is covered in blood, do not help her. Follow rule No. 2 about her, and if you can do it discreetly, run away.”*   

  

*-“That’s so creepy! Don’t tell me you think we’re going to meet such a woman! So far there’s only one simplistic rule and two rules clearly based on a super-famous myth!”*  

  

I got up, I was angry, I felt like we were being laughed at. I'm sure it's all lies on that paper, but Mia seemed so enthusiastic that I didn't want to get angry. She'll realize during this stay on her own that there's nothing. Obviously...   

*-“We will be able to check this evening if everything is true. Rule No. 4 states: “If we hear screams or calls for help through the ventilation ducts during the night, from children, women, or men, we must ignore them and respect the first rule. Earplugs are provided in the drawers of the nightstands.”*    

I turned to her.   

*-“If I understand correctly, we might not be able to sleep because of the screaming in the vents? It will surely be the noise of the old mechanisms of these vents which must make a strange noise.*   

   

*-“You have an answer for everything, don’t you?”*    

   

I had annoyed Mia. It was to be expected, I can't keep quiet. She made a remark to me that I'm not likely to forget.   

*-“Alec, if you’re so sure of yourself, you don’t need to think about it or prove it, it will happen by itself. If you’re looking for so many reasons to rationalize events that haven’t happened yet, it’s out of fear!”*    

  

*-"Fear… ? "* 

   

*-“Yes, fear! And not fear of being wrong, fear that it exists!”*   

  

*-“I’m not afraid! Since it doesn’t exist!”*   

  

*-“If you want, soon we will know more about what is happening here.”*    

She continued reading the document.  

*-"There are less interesting rules, such as:*  

*– No. 5: The prohibition on going down to the basement, regardless of the reason.*  

*– nᵒ 6 Do not bother special customers, recognizable by a symbolic pin on their clothing.*   

She giggled. *“I don't see why we'd go down to the basement, or chat with those famous customers. To be special, they must be snobs.”*

I got out my things to take a nice hot shower, thinking it would do me good. While the water was running, I heard a knock at the bedroom door. I hurried to finish, then stepped out, my hair still wet and a towel around my waist. Opening the bathroom door, I ran into Mia, who looked me up and down with a teasing smile.  

  

*-“Is this a hell of a show you’re putting on for me?”*   

I blushed. I felt uncomfortable and ridiculous and stammered.   

*-“No… uh… well… it’s just that I heard someone came and I wanted to see what was going on.”*   

I ran to the bathroom to finish getting dressed. Mia was fine.  

  

*-“So who was that? At the door?”*    

  

*-« Le room service ! »*  

  

She pointed at the metal cart our meals were on.   

*-“Did you order something?”*   

  

*-“No, actually I thought it was you, but after talking to the employee who brought the cart, I realized that wasn’t the case. Rule #7 says that meals are included in the reservation. Lunch is served in the restaurant, but dinner is served in your room. Only special guests can access the restaurant in the evening.”*   

  

*-“Okay… We’re not classy enough for them.”*  

I was perplexed by the idea of ​​a mandatory room service meal. I've never really stayed in hotels, but this practice struck me as suspicious.  

Silence fell in the room. I was holding myself back from exploding again, and Mia seemed to sense it. She let me struggle with my thoughts, calmly observing my reaction. Finally, I made up my mind.  

*-“So, what’s on the menu?”* 

I started wondering if this dinner might be poisoned. Mia was right. I was scared. I was getting paranoid, when if I followed my usual logic, I shouldn't be.  

*-“Fried chicken. Nothing special, ordinary and overdone.”*   

   

*-“We could have been vegetarian!”*   I said, just to have a criticism to make.  

I inspected the chicken, the fries, the dips, the sodas. I examined everything before touching it, turning and turning each item, sniffing them, eyeing them suspiciously.    
Mia finally placed her hand on mine to put an end to my ridiculous investigation. She took a fry, dipped it in the dip, and ate it, slowly, chewing excessively. Then she held up her hands and shrugged.  

*-“You see, nothing happened to me!”*  

I felt stupid. We ate in silence, each at our own pace. After all, we needed a break from the drive and all the strange little things we'd noticed.  

After dinner, we smoked a cigarette by the window. It was probably forbidden, but none of us wanted to go down to the parking lot, and we figured that from the third floor, no one would notice. From that height, the forest under the starry sky and the bright moon was beautiful to see. Then everyone went about their business, Mia lay down and read a book, and I started writing this story. Until sleep took us away.  

\-‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was 2:00 a.m. when Mia and I were awakened by a metallic clatter. It sounded like scrap metal being violently struck. The noise resonated throughout the room, vibrating in the walls, deafening, almost suffocating. Even with the famous earplugs provided by the hotel, it was impossible to escape it.  

*-"Do you... hear the same thing as me?"*  

With her hands pressed against her ears, Mia gave me a frightened look.  

*-"Yes, yes, I hear it too... What is that?"* 

I gestured in confusion, trying to make myself understood over the din. To speak, I had to raise my voice, almost shout, and even then, our words were lost in the noise.  

*-"It's really too loud, it's unbearable! What's going on? Do you think it's a problem in the hotel? The pipes, or something?"*

  

 *-"I… I don't know. Maybe an urgent repair? Something they couldn't postpone?"*  

It's true, I didn't know anything about it, a noise like that waking you up in the middle of the night can only be terrifying, but if I try to rationalize, there may be logical answers. The noise was jerky, sometimes louder, sometimes a little quieter, as if whatever was hitting weakened at times and then started up again violently. The ventilation was right above the bed, I stood up to get closer to it.  

*-“They were talking about screaming in the vents, not noise like that!”* Mia said indignantly.  

  

*-“Would you really have preferred to hear people screaming in pain?”*   

  

*-“Um... I don't know... no... I hadn't thought of that! I just want this horrible noise to stop!”*   

We're on the top floor, yet we can hear it so loud. I put my ear to the ventilation grille. The noise, already unbearable in the room, was becoming a real torture at this distance. I hoped to make out something, a detail, a sound that would help me understand. And that's when I heard it... Behind the deafening metallic crash... a scream... a call for help. A child's voice. My blood ran cold. It was so realistic... Was I going crazy? I didn't want to tell Mia, I didn't want to scare her, but I didn't know what to think. A child would be trapped somewhere and banging on the pipes? Impossible! I felt my legs give way under my weight. I stared into space for a moment; I wasn't used to reacting emotionally or physically like this. Mia was looking at me intently, waiting for me to speak to her.  

*-“Did you hear something? Do you have any ideas?”*   

I didn't answer right away. I was going to tell him... no, nothing came out.    
Then the noise abruptly stopped. A heavy silence filled the room. It should have been reassuring, but it wasn't.  

And that's when we heard it, both of us this time.    
Cries. Screams of pain and sadness. Heartbreaking words, which gradually faded away, becoming lower and lower, until they almost disappeared. 

 

*-“Help… Mom… come on please… Dad, save me, I’m here… I’m here…”*  

Then nothing but the sound of my heart breaking. I wasn't even sure I really had one until today. I don't dare talk to Mia. I can't believe what's happening. Tears are streaming down my face and I hear Mia... her shaky voice.   

*-“What is this… horror…”*
