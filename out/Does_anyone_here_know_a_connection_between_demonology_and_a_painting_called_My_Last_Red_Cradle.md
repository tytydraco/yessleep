It’s hard to describe an impulse with words. By definition, it’s an unreflective urge. An overwhelming feeling that compels action, disentangled from the stickiness of logic and forethought.

For example, I couldn’t verbalize *exactly* why I had slammed the key to my Dodge Pontiac through the soft flesh under the security guard’s mandible. Other than “*the painting relieved my headache, and he was trying to pull me away from it*”, but the investigating officer had already dismissed that explanation as unsatisfactory.

But that’s the truth I had access to at that moment. After what felt like the fortieth time he asked, all I could do was shrug.

The resurrection of my lifelong headache wasn’t doing me any favors, either. As soon as my eyes left the painting, the pain came crashing back. It felt like my entire skull had its own pulse. A paralysis inducing ache I was all too familiar with.

\------

This searing misery has been my stalwart companion for about fifteen years; an undiagnosed migraine disorder that started when I was three.

Every doctor’s visit would begin with a review of my family history. No migraines on my dad’s side, and my mother deserted the both of us when I was a toddler. Left in the middle of the night, no note. According to my father, she was never very forthcoming about her medical history, either.

We both assume I inherited this curse from her.

No scan of my brain ever revealed deformity or dysfunction. The pain was not an atypical seizure. As far as western medicine could tell, I was healthy as a horse. Psychiatrists blamed subconscious trauma from abandonment, but it’s not like antidepressants lessened the pain, either.

I’ve learned to live with it. Even weather bad dates through it.

I’d never been to a museum before today - Dad always made it seem incredibly dull. A waste of time for people that had nothing better to be doing. The one time my school went on a field trip to a local museum, Dad forbade me from going; weird in retrospect, but at the age of nine, I was just happy to miss a day of school.

Today, my boyfriend insisted we go, and I simply didn’t have the energy to argue. I figured Dad would say I couldn't go, and that would be that. 

To my surprise, that isn't what he said at all.

*"Sure, honey. I think today is the perfect day, actually."*

\--------

Dad was right, though; the experience was an absolute slog. Excluding the aforementioned miracle painting, of course.

When my eyes were pointed in its direction, regardless of distance, the pain lessened. I wasn’t even consciously looking at it in the beginning. Instead, unexpected relief magnetized my body, guiding me right to it.

Transfixed, I stood motionless in front of the unassuming watercolor. It was a small squared frame - each side only a half a foot long.

I couldn’t tell precisely what the composition depicted. The canvas was a maelstrom of color - a surface completely consumed by a veritable tempest of animated pigment. I couldn't believe the eroded wooden frame was able to hold the vast, cyclonic energy contained within. At any moment, it felt like the piece’s color could rupture its meager cage and explode out into the surrounding museum, swallowing its patrons in a rushing wave of indigo and crimson.

As I stared, the hypnotic swirls gave me more respite than morphine ever did.

The plaque next to the painting read:

***My Last Red Cradle****: By Dupuis*

“*Considered by many to be the last great work of modernism, it is said the architecture of an umbilical cord inspired this haunting piece. When asked about the painting, Ms. Dupuis responded with this cryptic message:*

*Meaningful art is inevitably built on sacrifice. Desperation is the canvas. Blood is the paint.*

*When it’s finally time to become legion, do not be afraid to give in.”*

I didn’t even register that my nose was touching the canvas until after I impulsively pushed blunt metal through that man’s jaw.

As another example of an impulse, when the guard let go of me, I reflexively jumped between him and the painting to shield it from the ensuing blood sprays. I didn’t know *why* I cared about protecting the canvas, but in that moment, nothing was more important to me.

Not to say impulses are arbitrary. It’s more that you may not have a perfect understanding of what’s driving your actions at first.

As soon as I made bail and got my phone back, I sprinted to my car and hopped in, my eyes glued to the screen as I searched online for the painting. It didn’t take long to find it, but it didn’t work like the original in the museum, either. No matter how large I made it on the screen, no matter what resolution the picture was, it didn’t provide me with an ounce of relief. Instead, pain and frustration danced hectic circles against the rim of my skull, and I almost broke down completely.

Before I could erupt, however, I noticed something on the screen that gave me pause. A familiarity of sorts.

The artist, Dupuis, looked a hell of a lot like me.

\-------

When I got home, I confronted my dad with what I found. Dupuis, he informed me, is my mother’s maiden name. 

He had known this entire time where she’d been and what she had been doing, and chose not to tell me. His words, not mine. 

Suddenly, my headache roared, louder and fiercer than it ever had in the past. My knees buckled from the discomfort, and I fell to the floor. As Dad bent over me, I felt my teeth reach for his neck, guided by the same relieving magnetism I experienced with the painting in the museum.

Before I could sink my canines into him, however, I stopped myself, my mind pushing back against the new and deadly impulse.

I didn't want to hurt him.

To my confusion, Dad didn’t move away as I rested my teeth on his neck, fighting to keep my jaw open. If I bit down, he was dead, but Dad didn’t move an inch. He waited; patient and understanding.

After about a minute of that horrible standstill, he finally spoke. As he did, I could feel the subtle pulsations of blood swimming through his jugular vein.

*“Do it, Felicity. This is what we’ve all been waiting for. Turn your suffering into purpose. Your desperation, the canvas. With my blood, you can paint the red cradle.*

*Go be with your mother. You’ve earned it.”*

It took every bit of willpower I had, but I pulled myself away from my father. Slowly, I lifted my teeth from his neck and took a few steps back.

For the first time, I refused to give in to impulse. Nothing, not even pain, would control me.

Dad slumped to the kitchen floor, letting his head rest awkwardly against the oven. He was silent for a moment, then his voice exploded with laughter. Between bouts of cackling, I heard him say,

*“What an absolute waste! Ms. Dupuis is going to be so angry.”*

As his laughing continued, strained and maniacal, blood started flowing down from the corners of his eyes. It wasn’t like crying; the stream was too quick. Unnaturally forceful, too. Pressurized to the point where it made an audible hissing sound as it poured from his tear ducts. As more and more blood poured out, the whites of his eyes became pitch black, and skin seemed to liquify like candlewax.

When the blood hit the floor, it didn’t just form a puddle, either. Instead, the liquid kept its rapid pace and started moving towards me, chasing closely behind my footfalls as I sprinted out the door.

Stepping into the car, I watched a horde of crimson streaks spill over the door frame, and I heard Dad screaming something in a language I didn't recognize. 

The same few nonsense words, deep and guttural, over and over and over again. 

\------

I’m holed up in a motel on the edge of town as I type this, trying to put it all together. My boyfriend is on his way over, and I'm not sure he'll believe me when I tell him what happened. 

I don’t think that man was my real father.

Dupuis may be my mother, though. As much as I want it not to be true, it feels right.

I’m trying not to give in to the pain. My head is throbbing. It’s almost like a compass, too. When I turn it, the pain doesn’t stay in the same place. It moves the exact *opposite* way, making sure it’s always pointed in the same direction, no matter how I turn my head. Some infernal weathervane buried deep within my psyche.

My impulse is to follow the pain wherever it leads me. 

As much as I don’t want to give in, I feel my resistance wavering, worn down by years of searing torment.

What in God’s name am I?

Is there a point in resistance, or am I just delaying the inevitable?
