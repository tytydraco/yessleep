"When was the last time you saw Joshua?" The sheriff asked me. At the time, I was lost inside my head and had a hard time recollecting all the memories from when we first learned of Joshua's death to me being questioned inside a classroom.

  
"You need to help the authorities do their job, son." The principal added. He sat next to the sheriff and wore a subtle smile showcasing his understanding of my shocked reactions.

  
"I... I'm not sure. We were together yesterday during school, and he told us he would check on Mike in the evening. I spent the evening with Nathan at my place."

  
"Yes, that's what Nathan told us too, but we asked Mike's mother and Mike himself. Joshua didn't visit their house yesterday. Do you have any clue where he spent the rest of the day?"

  
"No, as I said, I spent the rest of the day with Nathan-"

  
"Sheriff, I think the poor kids had enough for the day. They just lost their friend." The principal got on his feet and opened the door, smiling towards the sheriff.

  
"I think you're right. Chris, if you remember anything, have your parents call the station, and take care when walking at night. Joshua probably had a terrible accident due to the lack of light."

  
The sheriff walked out of the classroom, and the principal signalled me to follow up. When I exited the room, Nathan was outside. He had been questioned before me, so he was probably waiting for me to finish.

  
"Can we talk?" He told me while looking at his feet.

  
"Yes, what is it?" I answered.

  
Nathan looked at the policemen and the sheriff behind me, then leaned and whispered, "What if we are next?"

  
"What do you mean?" I whispered back.

  
"Time's up? That's what the text wrote. 'Time's up,' our time. We should stick together, Chris. We are in grave danger." As he spoke, I noticed his hand trembling. Nathan was in a terrible state, probably on a thin line before a complete mental break.

  
"Let's just stay at our houses. That's the safest place we've got. Also, my parents are really anxious and don't want me out wandering."

  
"Mine are too. Yes, let's do that. We'll talk tomorrow." Nathan started walking away, then turned and said, "Sorry that I doubted you."

  
"Don't think about it."

  
When I returned to my house, I spent a substantial amount of time in sheer anxiety. Joshua was dead, found in the ditch. I remembered other kids talking about it at school after the interrogation was over. Most of them said he fell; the sheriff seemed to think so too. But some said other things. I brushed it off as gossip; how unethical to spread lies in a time so tragic like that. Were they really lying, though? Some said that Joshua was found with a broken neck, indicating that he had died before he landed. Could people be so heartless as to lie about something so serious?

  
As my mind jumped from thought to thought, I felt the need to look out the window. I felt I was drawn to it. I wanted to look at the black figure; one time, he was at the window, and the other at the sidewalk. Where could he be now? My imagination grew wilder; could the figure be Him? The man with the low voice that answered the phone?

  
I felt that I couldn't resist; I needed to look. I got up and walked towards the window, I pulled the curtains and looked outside, then I froze in place. I tried to swallow, but I couldn't; it was as if time had stopped, and I was powerless to do anything at will.

  
Right outside my window, he lay. A tall figure wearing a grey suit and a top hat. His face was old, dark, with two swollen eyes that pierced me like arrows. He moved only his head, turning it once towards his right shoulder and then towards his left. The bell rang, and for a brief second, I was awakened from my trance state, only to be sunk in more thoughts of imminent doom. I was certain I was about to meet Joshua's fate. I closed my eyes out of fear when I heard my mother's voice.

  
"Chris, Mike's here!" she yelled.

  
I looked again at the window, and the figure was no longer there; I could only see a dim light at the house on the opposite side of the street. I felt relieved, but Mike burst into my room, adding to the anxiety that was enveloping me.

  
Mike was restless; he moved left and right and made little sense when he spoke.

  
"We're not safe... we're not safe... we're not safe!" he told me while looking directly into my eyes.

  
"Mike, you need to calm yourself. You are making too much noise."

  
"No, you do not understand, he is coming for me! I'm next; he is coming for me... I'm next!"

  
Stay tuned for the next part!
