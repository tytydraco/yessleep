  

I was sitting in my living room, trying to relax after what all had happened, The TV was on, but I wasn't really paying attention to it. I was lost in my own thoughts when suddenly, a commercial came on

*Welcome to the Hyperloop, the future of transportation. Imagine traveling from Delhi to Kolkata in just 15 minutes, or from Mumbai to Delhi in a mere 30 minutes. This is no longer a dream, it's a reality. The Hyperloop is changing the way we think about distance, making the world feel a lot smaller.*

*The Hyperloop is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation, powered by solar and electric energy. It's fast, efficient, and safe. It's designed to make your travel experience comfortable and smooth. With Hyperloop, you can now travel from city to city without the hassle of traffic or delays. It's also a game-changer for business and commerce, allowing for quicker and easier access to new markets.*

*“Crazy!”* I exclaimed, turning the TV off,

The shrill ring of my phone echoed through the room, jolting me from my thoughts. I hesitated for a moment before answering, my heart pounding in my chest.

*"Hello?"* I answered, my voice barely above a whisper.

*"Honey, it's me"* came my wife's familiar voice, tinged with a hint of concern.

The sound of her voice sent a wave of relief washing over me,

*"Honey, what happened?"* My wife's panicked voice came through the phone, her words tumbling out in a rush. *"I saw on the news that there's been a terrible accident on the Hyperloop. They're saying that there were fatalities and that it was caused by a mechanical failure. But something doesn't feel right to me. Please tell me you're okay."*

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. My mind was still reeling from the horrors I had just witnessed. *"I'm okay," I managed to say. "But there was no mechanical failure. It was something I’ve seen before, something ... supernatural.”*

*"What do you mean?"* My wife's voice was filled with confusion and fear.

*"I can't explain it"* I said, tears streaming down my face. *"But I was on that Hyperloop, and I saw things that I can't even begin to describe. I'm the only one who made it out alive, everyone else...they're gone."*

*"Oh my God"* my wife breathed. *"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? Do you need me to come home?"* 

*"I'm not hurt"* I said. *"But I need you. Please come home, I need to tell you everything that happened."*

*"I'm on my way"* she promised. *"I love you."*

*"I love you too"* I said, my voice barely a whisper.

As I hung up the phone, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in my chest. I made my way to the bedroom and collapsed onto the bed, but sleep eluded me. I lay there for what felt like hours, my mind replaying the events of the day over and over again.

Just as I was beginning to drift off, I was jolted awake by the sound of loud knocking on my front door. *"THUD, THUD, THUD"* it echoed through the house. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding in my chest. I thought it was my wife coming home, happily, I make my way to the front door, trying to shake the feeling of dread that was creeping over me.

As I opened the door, I was met with a group of people dressed in black suits. They didn't introduce themselves, but one of them stepped forward and said, 

*"We need to talk about what happened on the Hyperloop today."* 

I was confused, I thought it was my wife, but I realized that these people were not who they seemed to be, they were secret service, I give them a seat.

*"I'll start from the very beginning"* I said, my voice shaking slightly. *"I take the Hyperloop to work every day, it's the quickest and most efficient way to get there. But today, I decided to take a new shorter route that had just opened. There were lots of celebrations and I was very excited to try it out."*

The secret service agents listened intently, their expressions grave.

*"The train started off fine, it was smooth and fast. I was looking forward to a shorter commute. But then, when we hit 850 Kms per hour, something happened"* I paused, the memories of that moment flooding back. 

*"It was like...it was like the world around us shifted. Suddenly, everything was different. It was like we were in another dimension."*

The agents exchanged a glance, their expressions unreadable. *"Please go on"* one of them prompted.

*"I can't fully describe it"* I said, struggling to find the right words. 

*"But it was like nothing I've ever experienced before. The train was still moving, but it was like we were in a different place It was like we were in a different place, a dark and twisted version of reality. And then, I saw it. A dark, mystical creature. It was like nothing I had ever seen before, it was huge and terrifying, with glowing red eyes. And then, everything went black"*

I paused, my voice barely above a whisper and slowly tearing up,

*"I woke up to the wreckage of the loop, bodies scattered everywhere. The scene was gruesome and unimaginable. But that wasn't the worst of it, there was this strange, glowing goo everywhere. I was trapped in the vacuum tube, the one that the loop uses to travel at such high speeds, but instead of being flashy and bright like normal tubes, it was dark and filled with this eerie goo. "Suddenly, I saw a pair of green eyes staring back at me"* I said, my voice barely above a whisper*.* 

*"But then, I saw more and more of them. They were everywhere. And then, as I stared in horror, one of them moved closer to me, passing by me as if I wasn't even there. More and more of them did the same, moving past me, staring at the dead bodies. It was like they were studying them, trying to understand what had happened. They looked like wild creatures, with human-like hair and hands, but their legs and face were alien. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing. But then, as they continued to move around me, I realized they couldn't see me. They didn't even acknowledge my existence."*

The secret service agents listened intently, their expressions grave. *"Please continue*” one of them prompted.

*"I was trapped in that vacuum tube, surrounded by the grotesque remains of the passengers and these...these creatures. I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't even scream. I was frozen in terror. I watched as they continued to study the bodies, as if trying to understand what had happened’*

*“But then, I saw the red eyes again. And this time, I knew they could see me. I could feel their gaze on me, and I knew that I had to get away. I started running, from one tube to the next, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the creatures behind me, their footsteps getting louder and louder. I knew that I had to keep going, had to keep running.”*

*“And then, everything went black.”*

I take a breath,

*"I woke up in an ambulance Hyperloop, but I quickly realized we were headed towards the same vacuum where the previous loop had crashed," I said, my voice shaking with fear. "I tried to stop it, I tried to make them turn back, but they wouldn't listen to me. They insisted they had to reach the crash site to help the survivors. But deep down, I knew there were no survivors, only those remains and the creatures that studied them, and I didn't want to go back there."*

*The secret service agents listened intently, "What happened then?" one of them prompted.*

*"I pleaded with the paramedics, I begged them to turn back, but they were determined to reach the site and help the victims,"* I continued, my voice barely above a whisper*.* 

*"As we approached the crash site, my heart was pounding in my chest. The memories of that terrifying experience were still fresh in my mind, and I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that was creeping over me. I could see the wreckage of the Hyperloop in the distance, and my heart sank as I saw the twisted metal and debris scattered across the landscape."*

"*And the creatures?"* asked another agent.

*"They were still there, studying the bodies. I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to get out of there," I said, my voice trembling with emotion. "I stumbled out of the ambulance and started running, my mind reeling with fear. I then heard a loud BANG”*
