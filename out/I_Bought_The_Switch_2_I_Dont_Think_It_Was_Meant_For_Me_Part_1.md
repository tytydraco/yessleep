Hello, my name is Vincent. You could call me a “hardcore” Nintendo fan. I’ve been obsessed with Nintendo for as long as I remember. I first remember playing the GameBoy when I was about 7. I vividly remember the day Mom brought home Pokemon Blue. She was stuck in line at Kmart behind countless other people trying to get the game. When she had finally gotten home I was so excited to play it. I sucked at it though, 7 year old me couldn’t handle the critical thinking the game needed, so I ended up mashing buttons a lot of the time. Nonetheless, I had beaten the game after a long while and I found it a ton of fun. I still revisit it once a year or so, and I could talk about my experiences with Nintendo for a long time, but I need to get to the point here.

I always try to get a Nintendo console on Day 1 when it's released, despite the challenges of waiting in long lines and pre-orders getting canceled. I had gotten the original Nintendo Switch on the day it was released: March 3rd, 2017. I was lucky to have gotten it on the day it was released. I had basically walked to my local GameStop early that day and there it was, the Nintendo Switch, with the crowds beginning to pour in as I walked into the store. I had bought the system right then and there. Saying I was “excited” to go home and play it was an understatement. After that, I absolutely loved the Nintendo Switch. I thought it was the best console Nintendo had put out, so when they announced the Switch 2 a couple of months ago I was overjoyed.

Call me whatever you want, but I didn’t care much at all when they announced the new Mario Kart game was 80 dollars in my country. Or if the console was 450. I always thought people were overreacting about the controversial changes Nintendo had made. Anyway, the plan to get this console was the same as the one before. Go to GameStop early in the morning when it releases, and get it before the crowds arrive. Except, I had heard the stories of pre-orders for the new console already selling out within hours of pre-ordering becoming available, so I decided I would be at GameStop before midnight to get it.

The night of the Switch 2 release had come. I ate a late dinner and then went into my car and drove to my usual GameStop. I arrived at about 11:09 PM. I was expecting at the very least, a couple of people waiting already, but the lot was empty. Not a soul. I had arrived almost an hour early to avoid the worst of the lines, but no one was outside. They would only start selling the consoles at midnight, so in like 51 minutes. I waited in my car for a bit, waiting to see if people would slowly trickle in. 10 minutes had passed, no people. 20 minutes, no people. 40 minutes, no people. 49 minutes, still no people.

“How is this possible?” I thought. I shouldn’t be complaining though, I had just been extremely lucky, I guess. However, I couldn’t completely ignore how strange it was for people to be completely absent waiting in line. The clock struck midnight. I walked into the store, the interior of the GameStop was all too familiar to me. I took a moment to admire the atmosphere. I don’t come here often, so I might as well admire it. I walked up to the counter. To take my surprise further, there was only one employee I saw at the counter. “How the hell could this GameStop be so empty during such an exciting console launch?” I thought. Again, I really shouldn’t be complaining that I’m the first in line, so I brushed it off at that moment.

“Hello. Pretty empty today, huh?” I said to the employee, or rather Nathan, as that was his name according to his nametag. 

“Yeah. Sure is.” Nathan said.

“I’m sure you can guess what I’m here for though, one Switch 2, please!”

“Alright.”

Nathan went to the back as he grabbed the rather colorful Switch 2 box that it came in. Something looked a tiny bit off about it though, the box looked... shinier? No ratings label, no barcode. Just the red Switch logo and a faint plastic smell.

“$499.99.”

I paid using my debit card.

“Alright. Have a nice day.”

“You too Nathan, thank you!”

I was about to leave the store in my really excited state, but I decided to ask Nathan one more question.

“Wait, before I go, I need to ask,” I said. “Do you have any idea why I haven’t seen any people at this store today?”

“Don’t worry about it. Enjoy your console.”

“Okay, fucking strange.” I thought. I had never seen Nathan at this store before, and I already didn’t have a good impression of this dude. What he said was really weird, and he seemed to not care too much considering how few words he spoke. Still, I figured maybe he was just tired, or not the talkative type. Midnight launches aren’t exactly the peak social hour for people working at GameStop especially. I shook it off and headed for the door, clutching the Switch 2 like it was holy.

The car ride home was nothing exciting, though Nathan’s words had struck me as oddly eerie, making the experience feel a bit uneasy. Just what could he have meant by “Don’t worry about it”? Does he know something that I shouldn’t know? I couldn’t completely shake it off but I tried my best to rationalize in various ways.

I had gotten home. I grabbed my Switch 2 out of the car and opened my front door and switched the lights on. I was still very excited to open this thing up and try it, how could I not be? I put the box on my kitchen counter and got my pocket knife out. I cut the box open. The big screen and the Joy-Cons immediately greeted me. I tore open the plastic like I was a kid on Christmas morning again and felt the Joy-Cons and the screen. It felt good. The console as a whole was mainly all black, but one Joy-Con had some red on it and the other had some blue. Normally, the red is a shade of light red and the blue a shade of light blue. But something was off about the colors on my Switch 2. The red was kinda brighter, like a full-on red color instead of a lightish red, and the blue was a darker blue, closer to a navy blue. I shrugged it off once again, could you really blame me at this point? Normally I would be stupid to dismiss all of these weird signs about the console being off and the GameStop experience but to be honest, I was really tired, and I was also really excited at the same time.

Everything else about the console was completely normal, or at least seemed like it. Nothing off about the dock, charger, the controller to put the Joy-Cons on, nothing. I threw away all the plastic and kept the box somewhere safe, as I liked to keep the boxes that my consoles come in. I went to the living room and almost jumped on my very comfortable couch and took my shoes off as I was holding my Switch 2 in my hands, with my original Switch nearby so I could transfer my data. I turned on the Switch 2 and the very familiar white Nintendo logo appeared. And then it stayed. It was only maybe 30 seconds that it was on, but it felt like an eternity. It then transitioned to the Switch 2 logo. Then, the language screen. I selected English, obviously.

Finally, the home screen came up. But it wasn’t white like it should’ve been, it was black. Just empty space and silence. I brushed it off and went straight into transferring my data from my old Switch. Before I could though, I noticed some odd things.

On the top left corner, I saw a circle-shaped icon with a blue background with a familiar looking Mii.

It was my Mii.

I immediately went and pressed A on the selected icon. There was already an account registered on this Switch.

“VINCENT92”

“How the fuck?” I loudly said. I know I never added my user, I literally just turned this damn thing on! Yet, somehow, some way, my user was already added. Well, I say “my” user, but it technically wasn’t mine. It was a name I hadn’t used since middle school. I go by Vin\_Cent now.

That wasn’t all though, my friends were all there, except I noticed two on the top of the screen.

“Ethan” and “       “

Ethan’s was normal. It was a green background with the icon being Kamek, a common Mario character. The name rang some bells, but I couldn’t for the life of me remember who this Ethan person was.

“       “‘s (I’ll just refer to them as Blank) however, was strange, as you can already guess from the total lack of a name. Was it even possible to have a blank name? No, it wasn’t. “Must be a hacked user” I thought. His icon was entirely orange. No character or Mii featured. I tried to select his profile, but it wouldn’t let me. Nothing happened when I did.

As cliche as it was, I wanted to believe this was just a glitch. Yes, I know. The classic “must be a glitch” rationale. I wish I could scream into past me’s head that it wasn’t a glitch. Far from it.

After a while of staring blankly at Blank’s user page, I decided to go ahead and start the data transfer process. I wanted my games on the home screen, after all.

The process was taking maybe 20 minutes, a heavy storm had started outside by the time I started the transfer. it was going at a kinda normal pace. Like Loading bars usually act, it was stuck at 99%. It was stuck on it for maybe 2 minutes. Intense lightning and the pounding of rain on my roof were clearly audible, breaking the complete silence. I knew there was going to be some rain, but I never expected this bad of a storm. Then-

Lightning struck.

The lights flickered out for a second, maybe two, and when they came back on, the house felt quieter than before. My Wi-Fi was down. I sighed, thinking the transfer would’ve paused until it reconnected. But when I looked back at the screen, it said the transfer was complete.

Complete? No reconnection. No delay. Just done.

That shouldn’t be possible. “Well… whatever,” I mumbled. I tried to ignore the pit growing in my stomach and opened the game library. Everything was there, Animal Crossing, Smash Bros., even that random indie game I bought and never touched. But right in the middle of all of them, there was one game I didn’t recognize.

**Slot X-198**

I had no idea what the name meant. It sounded like some sort of test dev game or something of the sort. The icon was just a jagged white “X” on a black background, except it was so pixelated and low quality that you could spot each and every pixel on the image.

“What the hell is this?”

I couldn’t deny it now. Something clearly wasn’t right about my Switch 2. “Maybe I somehow just got my hands on a Switch 2 that was used for developer testing?” No, that just wasn’t right. How would it even make its way to GameStop of all places to be sold? Things just weren’t adding up. Another dilemma stared me right in the face: Do I return the console or dig deeper a little bit? If I returned the console now, I wouldn’t risk anything bad happening to me, as stupid as it sounds, on the other hand, if I dig deeper maybe I can find some potential answers to the questions and mysteries tonight?

“Ah, fuck it, time to boot up this ‘game’.”

Well, I tried to boot it up. What followed wasn’t your stereotypical “And then it all acted all glitchy and scary. The End.” mundane twist. What followed was a black screen for a long while. A really long while, like 2 minutes. Then the Nintendo logo. The Nintendo logo was shown for about 5 seconds then it abruptly cut to an error. Almost immediately after the error was shown, the game crashed and I was sent back to the home screen.

Out of morbid curiosity, I wish I could’ve read what the error said, but the damn thing barely popped up at all for me to read it, I only caught a few broken fragments of it, though.

“...incorrect user...”

“...has accessed...”

“...this software...”

I was too tired to swear at it out of confusion and frustration. I was tired. Yet, something was gnawing at me. I wanted to dig a little more deeper. I wanted to try that fucking X game again, I tried looking for it.

It was nowhere to be found.

It was like it was never there, like it somehow deleted itself after it crashed.

I was really starting to get freaked out at this point. I should’ve known this wasn’t normal. At all. Yet at the time I still thought this was some testing console one of the developers of the Switch 2 owned. I was stupid for thinking that, but I must emphasize yet again that I was tired. What time was it again during this? Probably around 1:10 AM. I wanted to go to sleep, but I knew I wouldn’t fall asleep in my current state. I needed something to calm me down from everything that had happened.

I looked through all the games on the home screen, then I found the perfect game, Animal Crossing New Horizons. It was a life sim game where you go to a deserted island along with animal creatures called “Villagers”. You then spend a lot of time developing the island, doing various activities to bring in more people and turn it into a whole town.

I booted up the game.

It kept loading. Then loading.

I was getting worried sick again.

Then to my relief, it loaded in after a while. With the familiar logo and my island being displayed. I started the game. My data was still there, like nothing happened. I was so relieved, I thought this was the end of the scary shit happening tonight.

I spawned in front of my house like you always do when you start the game. I hadn’t kept up with my island in forever, so I was expecting a mess. Surprisingly, it was pretty clean. I walked around my island, admiring all my hard work that had gone into this simple game. The game was synced to the real-life clock, so it was past midnight. Nobody was outside, all the shops were closed, so there wasn’t much I could do. I decided to get out my fishing rod and fish in a nearby river. I was fishing for a good 15 minutes, then my pockets were full of fish. “Maybe I should display some in my house?” I thought. I went to my fully expanded house, press A on the door, and it opened. What greeted me inside I will never forget.

I walked into my house.

It loaded normally, but… something felt off. The walls looked wrong. The lighting too. Then I noticed the floor.

It had my face on it.

No, it was multiple faces. Low-resolution. Smiling. Stretched into weird angles. You couldn’t make out many details.

All of the pieces of furniture had faces too.

Every item in the room, every single surface, was covered in me.

But there was someone else.

It was someone else’s face next to mine, it looked familiar, but for the life of me, I couldn’t recall who it was.

Even though there wasn’t much detail, I could tell there was a tiredness in his eyes. A sadness. I swear I’d seen it before, but couldn’t remember where.

I wanted to look away, but I didn’t. I just stared at the screen. I couldn’t bear to explore the other rooms or even do what I was meant to come here for. My emotions then were a mix of fright and shock. But there was also something else. I didn’t know the reason for it then, but I felt a slight lingering of sadness and happiness beyond those two emotions.

Nonetheless, this immediately destroyed any sense to continue playing. After staring at the screen in complete shock I just turned off the console without saving, which I didn’t care to take the time to. I left the Switch 2 on the couch and went straight to bed. I didn’t say anything. I was extremely tired. I didn’t even brush my teeth or anything, I just wanted to sleep as soon as possible. I slowly drifted off to sleep while the storm outside was still ferocious, but it eventually subsided, and then completely stopped.

That was a few days ago. Since then I couldn’t get myself to even look at the Switch 2 that was still on my couch. I just went into my room and played some games on my PC all day like nothing had ever happened. But now, after processing it all, I have decided to write about all of this, and I have also decided what I should do with my Switch 2.

I need to go back to the GameStop that I got it from and return it. Immediately.

I’m not resting until I get answers for what happened that night, and I’m sure I’ll get them when I go back.

Maybe he will be there again if I’m lucky.
