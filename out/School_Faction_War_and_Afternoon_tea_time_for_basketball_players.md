The dream starts with a negative tone, where two teams are engaged in a significant battle within a school.

Infiltration I, belonging to Faction A, managed to infiltrate Faction B, pretending to be one of them.

Initially, we entered a security room with no lights, but it had two prison-like windows at the upper corners near the door, through which sunlight was streaming in.

After a few dozen minutes, the sunlight subsided, and there wasn't much left to see.

In the security room, there was a somewhat overweight villain and another person who wasn't as cautious.

Behind the security room was a library with air conditioning.

A Malay male, acting as the library's guide or counter staff, let us into the cool library from the back door of the security room.

He informed us that all networks had been hacked by a hacker, advising us to leave and mentioning that he couldn't continue his profession.

I found it funny since I was a member of the opposing faction and now knew their information. However, the humor was short-lived. Someone on Facebook exposed me as a member of the opposite faction, marking me for elimination.

The Escape I ran, even performing the Golden Cicada gesture from Honor of Kings, all the while chanting "Jupiter's twelve houses."

it seemed ineffective.

but as I reached a seating area belonging to my faction, resembling those in American schools, and ran past a chubby individual, the scene changed. With a swift slap, he neutralized one of my pursuers after another.

Afternoon tea time for basketball players

A fragment of a dream narrative:

In the afternoon, I arrived at a gloomy school, its appearance eerily similar to a laboratory's white. The sensation it provoked was strange and nauseating.

Describing this discomfort is challenging—it's an unsettling feeling. The most horrifying aspect was discovering "someone in the class had been murdered."

I wandered into a basketball court and encountered several athletes, none particularly handsome. Notably, a pair of feet were immobilized on the side, echoing a previous news report about a student altercation that resulted in his legs being severed by other basketball players. Thus, the feet remained affixed to the court, eerily "standing" in place.

What's striking is the other basketball players seemed unfazed by this horror, casually sitting on the pavilion benches—the kind typically found at basketball courts... A truly terrifying scene.
