I'm a psychologist, and it's my job to listen and ask the right questions. Most cases, although different in many ways, tend to become similar in terms of human nature responding to traumas:: Son of a drunken father... Wife of an abusive husband... Sister who died in a car crash... The way our brain comprehends and deals with these tragedies and traumas are all very similar. Standard. Textbook. That's what I thought for 23 years. That's what I thought until I met Elizabeth Hunt. Case #357b.

I invited her into my office and she quickly got comfortable sitting on the floor Infront of my desk. She didn't talk for quite a while, just played with her doll and quietly hummed a tune, and I patiently sat there waiting for her to feel comfortable.

*"Do you believe in ghosts?"* Elizabeth's sudden question caught me off guard. I didn't believe in ghosts, but this wasn't about me.

"Do *you* believe in ghosts, Elizabeth?" I replied, trying to keep my tone neutral.

*"I do,"* she said, her eyes holding a haunting wisdom that seemed to defy her tender age. "Do you think you can help ghosts?"*

"I don't know. Have you seen any ghosts?" I asked.

*"No,"* Elizabeth replied softly, twirling the doll. *"But...I've heard them."*

"Oh? And what have you heard?" I prodded gently, hoping to coax more information.

*"I'm not supposed to say,"* she replied. Her eyes turned fearful and she quickly withdrew into herself, staring at the floor.

As the conversation reached an impasse, I decided to approach the topic from a different angle. "Elizabeth, I want to help you. I need to understand what you've been through. You can trust me."

She hesitated, her gaze fixed on the floor. *"It's--it's Daddy..."*

"What about your Daddy?"

*"He...He hurts me."*

"Oh, I see. And where abouts does he hurt you?"

*Ummm, everywhere. Well...he used to. He doesn't anymore."*

"What-what do you mean?"

*"Mommy used to ignore me and Daddy...I still miss her though I guess."*

"Elizabeth, I don't understand, what--"

*"Last night, Daddy said he'd had enough, and even though I screamed for mommy to come and help me, he just kept hurting me over and over and over, and mommy never came. Then suddenly...I just didn't hurt anymore. And then I heard mommy and daddy talking, and they sounded like ghosts. I don't know what they were saying...and then, I was here..."* Elizabeth then smiled and hummed a tune, and continued to play with her newfound doll.

I was completely speechless for the first time in my career and all I could do was tap my pen against my desk and stare at her. The tune she was humming cast an unnerving atmosphere, and I nervously looked down at the case files scattered upon my desk. And that's when I noticed it.

Case #357b:: Eloise Hart.

*What the--?...*

I quickly looked up from my desk to find an empty room. No Elizabeth. No doll. No humming. Nothing.

I looked back at my desk and saw that next to the case file, was a newspaper. The headline read::

***Body of eight year old Elizabeth Hunt found hanging last night. Suspected suicide.***
