I and my family were really close to my grate uncle we always called him mister T because of his is last name witch i wont tell for privet reasons. It a few day ago when he died to lung caners. this was a story that my grate unlaces told me on his death bed .

when he was a teen he was living in idea with his dad and grandpa who was a big game hunter always bragging about his trophy and skill to take down with his rifles witch was he admit it was beautiful. the rifle an old Kar-98 with silver barrel and old sandal wood with about 30 to 40 notches on the stock who also had beautiful spirals like artiest depictions of wind on the grip. His dad never like his grandpa he always send that " my dad your grandpa was shit hes always barging about his trophy's and hunts how they were amazing and bla bla bla" i just want tell him shut up and stop tacking about his hunts.

so it was a shock when he told us that he gonna go hunting and he wanted ask us if we wanted to go with him so we can bring home are own trophy a tiger" A tiger are you serious!" his dad was shouting "are you expecting a 16 with no hunting expressions to go hunting in the wild and kill a tiger" grandpa raised his hand and said "no he would not be shouting the tiger i gust want him to see what it like to hunt a living and breathing animal it would be" dad cut him off and said"no we will not be going to a hunt that revolves hunting tigers you know about the resent attacks that happening down their" as he took a deep breath" I'm not endangering my only child for your glory for hunting wiled beast "I know I know grandpa said with no worrier in his eye "he will be safe I will make shore of it." "You bedder for your own sack" dad stormed of to pack his thing and so did i more happy then my father.

I was so excited was probably not hunting the tiger my grandpa was vain not a dummy he'll probably set me up to hut some deer or other smaller less dangerous animals and not let me stray fare from him and my father and i was correct with my assumption grandpa grab us brought us to the jeep with two other guys are in named Johnson and Kline.

Johnson without a better description then the smart one he was the one that planed out the trips not my grandpa he was smart and friendly but he did not like tacking with other people. wile Kline reminder me of Daphne duck in attuned. we got in headed in to the jungle i think was 20 miles away from any major living areas it was us 5 in the jungle which was nice no loud market places no worry about someone trying to mug us for money gust the woods and us 5 guys roughing it in the jungle but before we even got out of the jeep Kline told us 6 rules to always keep in mind

1 snakes are everywhere and anywhere so watch your step. 2 always drink fast flowing water less likely to catch something bad. 3 all animals will defend them selves if cornered.4 If an animals is injured don't get near them they will still defend them selves.5 were your mask behind your head tigers like to strike when there pray is not looking this should trike them it to thinking that you are watching them.6 always and i mean always think your being watched because you never knows what behind you. That last rule was the one I will remember for a long time we seat up camp about 5 yard away from the jeep so what they said for a "quick escape." that seemed understandable when i was young but what I know now we should have parked it closer.

after getting set up for the long week of hunting. Me and Johnson went looked with a river for some drinking water. As we were walking away Kline shouted us "REMEMBER THE RULES! REMEMBER THE RULES" "we will Kline" shouting back Johnson. as we went down the hill slowing fading from site. as I waked i marveled at all of the bird call, the slight shacking of tree levees,the colorful flower I know are more deadly the they looked, and even some monkey swinging from tree to tree. I marvel at it but while Johnson was looking not at the flowers,bird nor monkeys no he was looking at the shrubbery almost like a robot not even looking at me then i saw it small deer about 80 yards ahead of us it so beautiful as it stand their.

It ran off a few minutes after we continue for bout 37 more minuets to we say the river a small one but still a river me and john grabbed as much water we can and went back but before i left i saw two little orbs of yellow darted back into jungle want they came. I know it was eye. eyes that tracked me threw the jungle and did not stop until i saw them which dispersed as i saw them i desisted to not go to that part river rather go down stream when getting water and will walking back i stand closer to Johnson for what i felt was protection form that creates in the jungle.

As we got back my dad was only one their so i asked him"hay dad where grandpa and Kline" they went hunting to bring something to eat" my dad said "for how long will they be gone for" I said "a few hours" "that was not part of the plane" Johnson Shouted "we where suppose to bring are own food" we all were posted but we eventually make a small fire to act as a smoker and cooker we grabbed a big pot to boil the water to get rid of all the germs then it was safe to drink the four about 3 hour we played cards and whited. wen they came back they brought a bore a big one about 200 pounds of bore meat that we ate and saved for later.after the meal dad blown up on grandpa" why did not think to bring food" he shouted"I did" grandpa said with a smirk. "then where is it" my dad said being more pissed then earlier "well it was in Kline backpack we did not seen them until we were a few miles away" "show them Kline. show them!" grandpa said without a worry in the world. Then Kline opened the backpack to show us about 20 to 25 cans good which dad was not pleased about it. As the day became night i when to go take a leek i saw those same eyes again but instead of dispersing they stayed. o god they stayed on me for about a hour always locked on me i didn't get much sleep that night or the other 3 nights

Th last day we spend there was bloody i and grandpa were the ones going hunting that day. i was nerves everyone gave me lesson how to shoot, stealth tactics ,what allowed an not allowed to hunt. the first thing that i shout was a monkey that wounder into the makeshift firing range which allowed me to practice my shooting skills I was eventually hoping to shoot a deer all my own with no help from anybody else but myself but feel like my grandpa just want to make sure that nothing bad would happen but I soon found out it was something different a more personal goal why I went with him and no one else came with me just my grandpa why is obvious why you spoke to me he said I want you to shoot the tiger the tiger I injected of course I didn't want to shoot a poor defenseless animal my grandfather re-insured me that it was open source that humans are the top apex pressure of any of any environment so we wait in the forest for bout an hour looking around and I could feel those two yellow eyes peering

I knew they were there I got a beard glimpse of them about 10 minutes ago but I was still not looking for the tiger I was looking for a way to escape my grandfather's wish to mercilessly kill a poor animal that had nothing to do with him. But my grandfather saw the tiger first either mean to rush and shoot the thing I hesitated missing my shop out free mirrors away from it my grandson took the rifle of out of my hands and grabbed it and reloaded a bullet and the loudest bang I have heard my life that's the bullet ripped through the Tiger's skin and out of its body hitting a tree next to it tiger went down and I felt nauseous but looking at that poor thing I couldn't believe that my grandfather would take down such a beautiful animal.

I felt nauseous and upset at what my grandfather done to the poor the thing was still breathing to the title was paralyzed from the neck down I could breathe think and live but couldn't move he was just pretty effing In-N-Out trying to save itself from the us such sadness and anger it wanted us dead and I knew it but my grandpa didn't he sliced the front of that thing to put it out of its misery at least I was the only thing you did good for it.

when we brought it back my dad and the rest were very angry with Grandpa they said that it was inhumane for me to go out there and tiger under the guise of us going hunting for a deer my grandpa interjected saying that we couldn't find a deer but I said beat that I saw it to your couple about 20 minutes before we even saw the Tiger but my grandpa said that there was no deer must have been hallucinating or something but my dad believe me we're going to pack up for the night and leave in the morning get on the cheap with the others and leave I wish we left sooner that night I heard screaming voices I was terrified men as as I saw when I got up a large tiger about the size of my dad rummaging through the campsite looking for someone that's when I realized that this Tigers looking for someone my grandpa the one that killed her mate .

I realized then that I had to get out of there somehow I can track the Tigers attention so I had to walk out my cabin but I looked back I was decision my life I saw was blood everywhere coming from can't wait Grandpa slept in blood everywhere as the tiger dragged and dragged my grandpa out of the tent and started mauling him making sure daddy she's save for him like a killer would do to a victim she was ruthless tearing out the legs first then going to the gut then ripping out all the antennas leaving him to die that will give everybody else up they started panicking and running. Me and told me to keep my eyes on the Tiger but the looked at me and my dad and then looked and ran after looking at Kline who hold it up a pistol expecting them to do anything to it the tiger just simply believed on to suffering a bullet wound with side but besides that quick be killed Kline one bite to the neck breaking it me dad and Johnson quickly ran for our lives to the Jeep and get into the Jeep first is Tiger one and US dead and there's no way I could have stopped it me and my dad or Johnson all three of us had no chance but we were lucky tiger Let It Go it's locked away but not before looking at us with the death stare I can read every emotion on that Tiger's face and what it said with its eyes is if you come back here again I will end you saying Wicked face of a devil because we got back in the Jeep grab the keys and left we told Villages about it but they didn't believe us we decided to keep it to ourselves except me

I decided to go back up there once when I saw was the tiger again looking at me saying yellowish eyes. I remember the warning and gave me with its eyes so I walked back home I thought my uncle was crazy by telling me this story no way did he tiger attack but he told me it was all true you had the tiger raining up in his house as a reminder to never go into those woods again.
