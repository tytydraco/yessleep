“...for we possess nothing certainly except the past…”- Evelyn Waugh

  
  


The sound of a gull startled me awake. My eyes instantly shot open. Sitting up I saw nothing but the near empty expanse of open ocean. The hard wooden bottom of the row boat had left my back sore and my joints achy. My mind felt foggy but through the haze came one crucial question: *How had I gotten here?* And more importantly where was here. I couldn't remember much from the night before other than that I had been drinking. In fact that was all I could remember, my own name had completely slipped my mind. I had no Idea what had happened. Was it amnesia or something else, perhaps I had permanent brain damage from a blow to the head? Who can say for sure? Surveying my surroundings I spotted a small island, by my estimate only ten or so miles away, an emerald on the horizon, the beautiful jewel of a turquoise crown. Searching the boat with my eyes I saw no paddle of any sort, no anchor, and surprisingly not even any rope or canvas. There was nothing in the boat except the clothes on my back. Absolutely no way for me to coerce the boat to move short of jumping out and pushing it myself. It was tempting to slip into the water to cool off and escape the infernal sun for a moment but I was far too exhausted to risk going in. The clear blue tinted water beckoned to me calling me to join the fish. Looking down at the schools of large fish swimming below me I was puzzled, although I had been on this boat for what must have been longer than a day, for me to have gotten this far from land was unreasonable. I felt no hunger. Despite its weight the boat sat fairly high in the water so I would undoubtedly have a difficult time getting back in if I ever was thrown out. And if somehow the boat was tipped I knew it would take the strength of five men to flip it back.



I stared longingly at the island far off in the distance, wondering what was on there, animals, plants, maybe even *people*? Wonderful thoughts of tropical birds flying from tree to tree, perfectly ripe fruit just waiting to be enjoyed. Friendly natives happy to help a stranger, maybe even a bustling port town hidden in a cove on the other side, however unlikely this was it was still a pleasant thought. The mysticism of the island perplexed me, had I been in any other situation I would not give a damn for this lonesome island thousands of miles away from anything worthwhile. Yet here I was wanting nothing other than to land the boat on the beach and jump out and set foot on solid ground once more. As far I was concerned the Island held everything I would ever want, because it was what I wanted at that very moment. No doubt it would be an improvement over my current situation.



 I had read a book at some point in my life that was surprisingly similar to what I was experiencing at this very moment. I don't remember when I read it, in fact at that very moment I understood I had forgotten my age. I didn't really know. How I could figure that out anyway, maybe cut off a finger and count the number of rings inside. I never really understood the novel when I first read it. The main character was a vegetarian, yet he still did everything in his power to maintain the proper nutriton of the tiger in spite of the difference between them and the threat to his own life. But now it has become clear to me. The tiger was all he had left of his family. Both of his parents had died in a ship wreck along with all of their physical assets. All he had left was a man eating beast that would have eaten him if he did not provide for him. I sort of wished that I had a tiger to keep me company, or something similar anyhow. No tiger would have a similar significance to me. My family was probably long dead, I don't remember. Staring into the water I thought I caught a glimpse of a reflection but I couldn't really make it out, only a rippling shape with a vaguely human form.



Turning back to the island I saw that it had gotten bigger on the horizon. The boat continued to drift towards it as though my will was driving it forward. Despite my seeming assured arrival to the island I couldn't help but be skeptical. Was the boat being drawn there or was it just a false impression imprinted on me by my desire to be there. Again I looked around the boat, looking and hoping to find something I had somehow missed the first twenty times I had checked around the boat. Somehow a small latch had appeared at the front end of the boat, I had no recollection of seeing this previously and was simply baffled that I missed it. The compartment it secured was much too small to hold anything of use. There was no way an oar could fit inside. I wanted so badly to open it but something held me back. The wonder of knowing what was in the compartment was probably better than whatever was actually in there. I thought about waiting for my initial excitement to fade before I would check within. I sat down in the middle of the row boat staring at the latch. I assumed it would hold various emergency materials such as a compass or a knife, perhaps even some emergency rations. None of these however struck me as particularly useful at the moment. A compass would be useless without a set of oars to direct me, and I still didn’t feel particularly hungry at the moment so if there was food it could wait.



To me the mystery is far more valuable, a small distraction from the more dangerous uncertainty of what the future holds. I would open it in a few days or perhaps if I ever got to the island. Sitting back I began to feel light headed again, the everlasting sun continued to bear down on me. I tried again to recall the circumstances that had brought me here but my mind felt hazy. I remembered drinking as I mentioned earlier and laughing at some point maybe, throwing up of course, and sharing some particularly unkind sentiments with an individual whose face I cannot remember. After that some monotone discussion, music and struggling to sit up, then I awoke in the boat. I closed my eyes and sat back feeling the row boat gently rock back and forth, listening to the waves lap against the white painted wooden sides. 



Again I awoke, but this time the sound was not a gull but instead roaring winds and crashing waves whipping and yawing the small boat too and fro. Rain stung my face. Quickly i took stock of my surroundings and could no longer see the island, perhaps it was hidden by the unrelenting showers or perhaps it was already hundreds of miles away. Forever lost in an empty sea. Of course I hoped to spot it by some miracle or even another island, anything really to break the emptiness of the sea. The boat continued to rock, throwing me back and forth, each rock getting closer and closer to throwing me out, yet I continued to hang on. Out of nowhere a large wave crashed down on my vessel, throwing me against the deck and knocking my head against the wall. I lay blinking for a few moments struggling to maintain conscience, fighting knowing I may not ever open them again, knowing I might be thrown from the boat, or even drown in the water beginning to pool in the bottom.



I closed my eyes for what felt like a second but when I opened them nearly everything around me had changed. The sky was bright once more with the great ball of flame and the boat was motionless not even disturbed by a slight rocking. It was as if I had blinked and the whole world had shifted several hours. Looking around the inside of the boat I saw that the latch that had secured the small door was broken and the door had swung ajar. Using all my strength I crawled to the compartment and inspected the interior, it was entirely empty aside from a small amount of sea water and sand trapped inside. Whatever had been held within must have been washed out, forever lost to the sea. But I began to wonder if there had ever been anything there at all or was it completely empty from the beginning?



Struggling to lift my head I peered over the edge of the boat and saw only twenty yards away was the sandy shores and lush forest of the island. 



It seemed almost too good to be true, everything I had wanted was laid out in front of me. After surveying my surroundings it became apparent that my boat had been thrown atop a reef. Despite the force it must have taken to lodge the heavy oak boat this far onto the reef its structural integrity stood firm. I could see no holes in the bottom and the small amounts of sea water must have come in from the storm. I sat back and pondered for a moment wondering how it was that I had been lucky enough to make it to the island. Why was I not anywhere else still alone in the empty sea and again I wondered if this was the same island I had seen before or was it a different one entirely. I briefly entertained the idea that I was meant to be here, that destiny had drawn me here for a purpose beyond my understanding. After turning this over in my mind for several minutes I dismissed the idea as a delusion bore of a desire for a higher purpose.



From my perch I could see along the coast line that stretched maybe a mile in each direction. If it was the same island I must have misjudged my original distance because now the island seemed much smaller than I had thought.



Finally after I had had enough of sitting and thinking I resolved to make some attempt to reach the beach. I had regained some of my strength after waking up but my mind was still ruled by the ever present haze. Although the water did not look too deep I would have to jump from the boat several feet away to avoid the reef. I had just risen to my feet, the boat providing a stable footing due to the fact that it was stuck on the reef. I wondered if I would have the strength to make it to shore in my condition, I felt weak yet determined to finally make it to the island. I imagined myself jumping from the bow of the boat into the water, my feet perhaps touching the sandy bottom before swimming to the surface, making my way towards the island, then wading in through the shallow water and standing on shore.



When I opened my eyes and looked down at my feet, they were half buried in sand on the beach. I had done it. But how? At no point had I felt the sensation of any of it, not the sand on my feet, the taste of the salt water on my lips or the stinging of salt water on my eyes and in my nose. Rather than question it I simply accepted it. Taking a moment to survey the beach there was nothing on either side short of a few rocks, looking down the beach to my right I saw what might have been a piece of driftwood.



I had only turned away for a few seconds but when I looked back there was a dark figure standing on the shoreline. It stood directly next to the water nearly twenty yards from the treeline. It was too far away for me to make out exactly what It was but of course my mind immediately assumed it was a man. I had given up all hope of finding any sign of human life on the island but here in front of me was more evidence than I needed. I had come so far that to see such a promise of human contact almost seemed too good to be true. It was close but at the same time I got the feeling it wasn't what I expected. Standing there I realized I was weaker than I thought, my arms and legs had no feeling. I could move them but no sensation followed. Moving my hand in front of my face they moved in a nearly indescribable way. When I tried to move a finger a different finger on the other hand would move. This was the same with my arms and legs. It puzzled me how this could have happened, I had never heard of such an ailment affecting even the most battered and beaten old old folks.



I took one step forward, my foot landing softly in the sand and shifting slightly to the right. My ankle twisting on its own and in a moment I was on the ground. I looked at the sand on my arm. In that moment I felt the same as a grain of sand, small and helpless, literally incapacitated to the point where I can only go where outside forces compel me to go. At this point I can’t remember making any major decision out of my own inhibition rather I am at the will of some outside force determining the course of my destiny. I have no need but the need to keep going simply searching for company, as much as i want to be on the island it wasn't enough. Now that I had gotten what I wanted it felt meaningless. I only wanted more, in fact I wonder if I got more, would I be satisfied? If I accomplished my goals, the things I have waited so long to take place, would that even suffice? Laying my head in the sand I felt nothing but the warmth of the sun and the empty feeling that continued to loom in the back of my mind.
