For the past few weeks I’ve been receiving a ride request with a pickup location in the middle of nowhere. I told myself when I first started that, the job wouldn’t be permanent, and I’d soon be working in clinics like I’d been training for. Fast forward a year and I’m still an uber driver with a boat load of student debt and a degree gathering dust. Ride requests tend to quiet down from 9pm on weekdays but as soon as it hits Friday or the weekend, no sooner do I accept one request three more are sent my way.

 

One night I had just about enough of all the drunk students piling into my car and arguing with me to take their friend who was already vomiting in the drain by my wheels, that when I received a request from out in the countryside I immediately clicked yes. I felt relieved to finally leave the city streets after so long but as soon as those neon lights faded away in my mirror, I felt an unease come over me. After driving so long the lack of other cars on the road didn’t really cross my mind until I was just a couple meters away from the pickup location. Completely autopilot until this very moment when it felt like I was being shook awake and subjected to a barrage of “red alert your about to be killed by an axe wielding madman”. There were no streetlights whatsoever and the only visible light for as far as the eye could see where my headlights failing to pierce the dark endless void ahead of me. 100 yards away from pickup.

 

It was a field. Baron and lifeless without a single strand of green grass or crop in sight. No barn, no tractor, or cow, or sheep, or anything. I pulled up directly on top of the pickup spot and stared about me at a loss surrounded by darkness in a desolate land. I sat there drumming my fingers on the wheel and humming along to the radio trying not freak out until suddenly the passenger door behind me swung open. The seat behind groaned in protest and I felt a noticeable give in the car as it dipped heavily, and the car door slammed closed. I swivelled round in my seat to see my rider and froze instantly my voice hitching.

 

There in the passenger seat sat a young women dressed in a flower pattern skirt and a woolly jumper but something about her felt off. She looked normal enough, but it was something about her eyes. They looked too big for her face. Her sockets even. They seemed to bulge almost forcing the bone to widen causing the skin around to stretch haphazardly. Granted there wasn’t much light in the car besides my phone, but I swear her pupils seemed to take up almost the entirety of her eyes. She must have noticed my uneasiness since she smiled at me with her thin and cracked lips and nodded cueing me to go.

 

She was silent the entire drive. I even asked her awkwardly whether she was okay with the radio being left on, but she didn’t say anything. She just sat there staring straight into my rearview mirror smiling. When I reached her destination, it was just an old retail park. All the shops where closed or abandoned with boarded up doors and smashed in windows. I pulled up along the curve and told to her to “have a nice night”. She just smiled and calmly opened the door and stepped out watching me as I drove off.

 

The whole incident really freaked me out and I decided to end the night right there and then and go home. The very next morning however, I checked the app and saw that I had been tipped for my last ride. “Flora tipped £50”. The ride itself cost only £15 but I’d get £11.25 after Uber took their share. I couldn’t believe my luck and felt a weight fall from my chest being able to pay my rent for the month. So for the week after I continued my rides as usual and when “Flora” requested a ride I clicked yes, every time.

 

It was always the same pickup location and drop off, and she’d always do the same thing. I’d park in the field, turn the radio on and wait. She would appear out of the darkness from the right, open the door and sit behind me smiling. We’d arrive at the retail park, and she’d step out watching me leave. £50 tip every ride for 3 rides a week and I was making bank. However a few days ago, something changed.

 

I parked in the field and turned the radio on, and out stepped Flora wearing the same outfit she always does. This time though, instead of sitting behind me she sat directly next to me. She had swivelled round to face me and didn’t blink once. I turned to her and said, “Hi Flora, ready to go?” and she nodded but just before I set off something on her jumper caught my eye. I never noticed it before, but on her jumper was a name tag that read “Sarah”. I had grown used to her so much that all of the weirdness about her that first ride had melted away so I asked her, “Would you like me to call you Flora or Sarah?” and pointed at the name tag. I shouldn’t have said anything.

 

For the first time ever she stopped smiling. She kind of frowned slightly at the question and sat in silence for a minute. It felt like an eternity looking into those vacant abyssal eyes waiting for an answer. Suddenly, her mouth opened beginning from the corners reaching to the middle like a zipper and widened unnaturally. The only light in the car was my phone screen as it always was, but I swear that inside of that mouth was completely empty. She looked like one of those plastic baby dolls which had a permanent open mouth for a bottle but didn’t have any teeth or painted gums. Just complete darkness all the way in. A bubble began to form around her lips in the few seconds they were open and burst as “Sarah” erupted from her mouth before snapping closed and resuming a smile. Her voice sounded static and strangely high pitched unlike anything I’ve heard.

 

The wheel was slick with my sweat and the car revved slightly from my shaking legs. I forced a smile and began to drive with those giant eyes fixed on me. I felt my heart pounding in my chest as I pushed down on the accelerator racing towards the drop off where she would finally leave, but as I rounded the corner of the woods a deer sprang out in front of me. Smashing into the hood of my car and skidding across the road in front leaving behind a perfect glistening streak of blood. I stared ahead towards the deer my heart beating louder and louder pulsing from within my ears until a notification rang from my phone reading “Ride cancelled”. The passenger door swung open and Sarah stepped out from the car walking towards the deer before stopping and turning to wave me goodbye.

 

To my astonishment I woke up the next morning to a tip of £100 and a message that read “See you again soon”. I really need the money, but I don’t know if I I’m pushing my luck with this situation and I really need some advice.
