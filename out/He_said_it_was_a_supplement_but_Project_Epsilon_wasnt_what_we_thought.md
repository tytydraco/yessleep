I can’t remember where I first saw the flyer. Maybe taped to the gas station window. Maybe slipped under the wiper of my car while I slept.

All I know is that I wasn’t supposed to find it.

Volunteers Needed for Paid Medical Study. Cognitive Enhancement. $2,000 a week. Confidential.
Helixion Research Division.

At twenty-eight, I was already running on fumes — a paramedic without a license, fired for stealing meds I swore were for someone else. A lie that still aches like an exposed nerve.

Now I sleep in my car, neck stiff, dreams thin and stuttering. Guilt sits on my chest like a second heartbeat. So when I saw $2,000 a week, it didn’t feel like a trap. It felt like mercy.

The address led me deep into the industrial district — a dead zone of cracked asphalt and hollow warehouses. The air smelled like rust and rain. A single light burned above a metal door with no sign, no windows. Just a keypad and a speaker.

I stood there a moment, listening to the silence pressing against me. I could hear my own pulse.
Then a man’s voice came through the static. Calm, even.

“Participant name?”

“Alec Davis.” My voice sounded thin, like it belonged to someone else.

The lock buzzed.

“Enter and proceed down the hall to Trial Room C.”
Inside smelled of bleach and dust — that dead hospital scent that never really leaves you. The hallway stretched white and endless, lit by humming fluorescents that flattened every shadow.

The door labeled TRIAL ROOM C waited at the end like a final command.

That’s where I met Dr. Kessler.

He didn’t look like a man who belonged in nightmares. He looked trustworthy. Clean white coat, gentle voice, smile tuned to the perfect frequency of reassurance.

“You made it,” he said warmly. “You’re doing something very important today.”

I tried to laugh. “Important, huh?”

He gestured to the woman seated at the table — about my age, maybe a little older. She had the kind of beauty that looks accidental: blonde hair falling loose around her face, green eyes that caught the light but stayed cautious. A duffel bag rested at her feet like she hadn’t unpacked her life yet.

“This is Emma Cox,” Kessler said. “You’ve both been selected for this phase. Project Epsilon studies a compound that enhances cognitive synchronization — memory, focus, adaptation. You’ll eat here, sleep here, and record every sensation. Compensation is guaranteed.”

Kessler’s smile didn’t move his eyes.
“Rest is essential to performance.”

He opened a silver case on the table. Inside were two blister packs, each capsule shimmering blue-green — iridescent, like beetle shells.

“You’ll take one nightly for seven days.”

I asked the only question that mattered. “Has anyone tried it before us?”

“Of course,” he said too smoothly. “But you’re the first to receive the purified strain.”

That word — purified — stuck to the back of my mind like a warning label.

He slid contracts across the table. Dense print, page after page of legal fog. I could’ve been signing over my organs and wouldn’t have known.
But I signed anyway.

So did Emma.

Kessler gathered the pages, satisfaction tightening his jaw.

“You’re both helping shape the next phase of human cognition.”

He didn’t look at us when he said it.

He looked through us.

And for the first time that night, I wondered who exactly was studying whom.

Kessler left us with a polite smile and the sound of a lock sliding home behind him.

“Dinner will be served soon. Your first dose begins at midnight,” he’d said.



The room was small — two beds, a sink, a single table with three metal chairs under an overhead light that hummed faintly. Everything smelled sterilized, lifeless.

Emma stood at the sink drying her hands with a rough white towel.

“Do you believe this guy?” she asked.

“Not really,” I said. “But I believe in two grand a week.”

She laughed — quiet but real.
“Yeah. Me too.”

She hung the towel, then took the chair across from me.

“So, since we’re stuck here together, we might as well get to know each other,” she said, leaning forward. “I’m Emma Cox.”

“Alec Davis.” I shook her hand. Her grip was firm.
There was a pause, a small awkward silence neither of us minded.

I asked, “So why’d you sign up?”

Her smile thinned. “ummm…You first.”

I told her about losing my job, about the pills, about the car I sleep in that smells like rain and old fast food. By the end, she was studying me — not judging, just seeing.

“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “That sounds hard.”
I shrugged. “You get used to it. Skipping meals helps you lose weight, right?”

She laughed, and the sound eased something tight in my chest.

Then she told me her story — how she’d been a biology student before her mother’s illness bankrupted the family, how she drifted through cleaning jobs, bartending, even escort work when rent got close. Her voice didn’t crack. She said it like she’d already forgiven herself.

When she finished, I didn’t know what to say. So I just stood and hugged her. For a second she froze, then her arms came around me. We didn’t let go until the hallway lights flickered and the door clicked open again.



Dinner was a beige blur — protein paste, vitamin bars, and water that tasted like static.

At midnight, Kessler returned carrying the same silver case. Two capsules waited inside, glowing faintly under the lights.

“Swallow and record your impressions in the logbook,” he said.

The pill was smooth and cold. It tasted like the air before a thunderstorm.

Kessler watched until both were gone. Then that thin smile again.

“Welcome to the next step. Now get some rest”
He left, and the door locked.

I woke before the lights came on. For a moment I thought I hadn’t slept. My head was too clear, my thoughts sharp and fast, like someone had cleaned the fog out of me.

Every sound was crisp — the hum of the light, the buzz in the wiring, even Emma’s breathing across the room.

She stirred, blinking at me.
“You feel that?”

I nodded.
“Yeah.”

Her grin spread slow and bright.

“Holy shit. This is amazing.”

We stayed up talking until the sterile walls didn’t feel so cold. She laughed easy, unguarded, and for the first time in years I didn’t feel broken.

At breakfast, everything was too vivid — the iron in the water, the chalk of the protein bar, the ozone bite in the air.

Kessler watched from behind the glass, pen gliding over his clipboard.

“How do you feel?”

“Awake,” I said.

“Focused,” Emma added. “Like I could run through a wall.”

Kessler’s lips curved.
“Excellent. You’re processing as expected.”

Hours passed without hunger, without fatigue. We played pattern tests and reaction drills; Emma beat me every time. Each win made her laugh harder, and I didn’t mind losing. Watching her light up was enough for me.

When Kessler finally dismissed us, I caught his reflection in the glass — eyes gleaming faintly, fixed on us longer than necessary.

That night Emma couldn’t sit still. She paced barefoot, her fingers drumming against her thigh.

“It’s like my brain’s too big for my skull,” she said, half laughing, half afraid. “Every thought I’ve ever had is right there, waiting.”

“Sounds like you’re high,” I said.

“Maybe,” she whispered, “but it feels right.”

We lay on our beds after lights out, the dark not really dark anymore. Colors pulsed behind my eyelids, synced with my heartbeat.

Emma’s voice drifted across the room.
“You see it too, don’t you?”

“Yeah,” I whispered.

There was a  long pause before Emma spoke again.

“I’m glad I volunteered,” she said. “Because I wouldn’t have met you otherwise. I haven’t been this happy in like years.”

I smiled into the dark. “I’m glad you did too. I feel the same way.”

Her voice softened. “When this is over… maybe we could go out sometime?”

I froze, heart hammering. “Yeah,” I managed. “I’d like that.”

“You promise?”

“I promise.”

For a moment, the hum in the walls almost sounded like music.



By the third morning, the high had changed. It wasn’t euphoria anymore — it was something sharper, hungrier.

During a memory test, Kessler read off a string of random numbers. Before he even finished, Emma and I repeated them back.

Perfectly.

In unison.

Kessler froze mid-note. “How did you—?”

Emma frowned. “I just… heard it. In my head.”

She looked at me, uneasy. “Did you?”

I nodded slowly. “Yeah. I heard you say it before he did.”

His eyes flicked between us, something new and bright behind them. “Fascinating,” he murmured, scribbling. “Cognitive resonance.”

When he left, the silence clung to the room like humidity.

Emma leaned close, whispering, “I think it links us. Like we are connected somehow.”

Her voice shook. She didn’t know if that thrilled or terrified her.

Neither did I.



That night, the air itself seemed to breathe.

A faint pulse ran through the walls — steady, rhythmic — like the whole building had a heartbeat. 

The fluorescent lights flickered in time with it.

Emma paced, barefoot again.

“It’s all connected,” she said, half in awe, half slipping toward something else. “Everything’s humming the same note.”

I laughed quietly, though it didn’t sound right. “Maybe we’re just hearing things. Could just be a side effect."

She turned to me, eyes wide and glassy. “No, Alec. This is too much of a change to be a side effect.”

The hum deepened, a vibration crawling through the bedframe, into my bones.

When I closed my eyes, I saw shapes forming in the dark — pale lines twisting behind my eyelids, pulsing in rhythm.

Emma’s voice came from somewhere far and near at once.
“You see it too, don’t you? The lines?”

“Yes. I do.”

A long pause before she spoke again.

“Alec… if this thing links us, can you feel what I feel?”

“I don’t know. Maybe.”

She smiled faintly. “Then I guess you’ll know when I’m thinking about you.”

I smiled back, though it felt wrong — too wide, too tight. The hum beneath my skin vibrated like a second pulse.

Later, I thought I heard whispering behind the walls. Not words — just intent.



The next morning, during another test, Emma’s nose started bleeding. Just a red bead. She wiped it away before Kessler noticed.

He was glowing with excitement. “Synchronization is accelerating,” he said. “You’re remarkable subjects.”

After he left, Emma pressed a tissue to her nose. “It’s nothing,” she said, but her hands were trembling.

I didn’t argue. My own temples had begun to throb — a slow, steady pressure, as if something beneath my skull was trying to breathe.

That night, when the lights went out, our breathing synced. Perfectly. Every inhale, every exhale, like our lungs were sharing the same rhythm.

And in that quiet, I realized neither of us was leading.
Something else was.



By the fifth day, the hum in the walls had changed.

It wasn't in the background anymore. It had rhythm.

Every breath, every heartbeat matched it — mine, Emma’s, the lights overhead. We were moving in the same invisible current.

She lay on her bed whispering strings of numbers, half-asleep. She finished the sequences before I spoke the last digit.

When I asked how she knew, she just smiled.
“I told you. We must be connected.”

The logbook beside my bed wasn’t written in my handwriting anymore.

It looked like mine — but tighter, sharper, words coiled like veins on the page.

Kessler skimmed it that morning and smiled like a proud parent.
“Integration is progressing beautifully.”



He’d stopped taking notes. Now he just watched — like he could see something beneath our skin that we couldn’t.

That night, the pressure behind my eyes turned to pain. Not sharp — deep. Like something inside my skull was trying to remember how to move.

I heard the whispers again, closer this time. Not words. Just vibration, a low intent.

Emma said she could see sound now — every noise leaving a shape in the air.

“It’s beautiful,” she whispered.

Her nose bled again, thicker this time. She didn’t even flinch until I wiped it away.

“Emma,” I said softly, “you studied biology. You know this isn’t right.”

She looked up at me, and I saw light flickering faintly behind her pupils.

“It’s not supposed to be right,” she said. “It’s supposed to be new. Something not studied yet.”



That night I dreamed of water — black and still. Something pale moving beneath it, waiting for me to breathe it in.

When I woke, Emma was sitting at the foot of my bed, watching.

“You called my name,” she whispered. “I heard you in my sleep.”

“No, I didn’t.”

Even as I said it, I wasn’t sure.

Her voice trembled. “Can I sleep with you tonight? I don’t want to be alone.”

I nodded. She slid under the covers, skin fever-warm, breath syncing perfectly with mine.

For the first time in years, I felt calm — and under that calm, something was pulsing wrong.

When I drifted off, I dreamed of light.

And it was inside us.



By the sixth night, the capsules looked different — darker, almost bruised.

Kessler called it refinement.

“Your bodies are stabilizing,” he said smoothly. “You’re entering the final phase.”

“What does that mean?” I asked.

“Completion.”

The word didn’t sound like science. It sounded like worship.

After he left, Emma rolled her capsule between her fingers. The surface shimmered, faintly alive.

“He’s lying,” she whispered.

I looked at her with a considered look. “You think so?”

She rubbed her arm, tracing faint white lines beneath her skin — lines that moved when she touched them.

“I think it’s still working, even without taking more pills,” she said. “Plus he’s giving us a completely different pill. That's not normal in these studies.”

We agreed to skip the next dose. Just once.
That was our mistake.



The hum started before midnight — low and desperate, crawling through the walls, vibrating in our bones.

My skin burned from the inside out. Muscles clenched like they were trying to tear free.

Emma screamed, clutching her head, nails digging into her scalp.

I ran over to her. “Emma! Breathe!” I shouted, grabbing her shoulders — and froze.

Something inside her chest was moving.
A second heartbeat.



The door burst open and Kessler stood there — calm, clipboard in hand.

“What did you do?” he asked.

“You’re killing us!” Emma screamed. “I should’ve trusted my gut from the start. You’re a monster.”

I tried comforting her but nothing seemed to calm the rage inside her.

Kessler tilted his head, voice soft and cold.
“I’m no monster, Emma. You’re changing. But you resisted because you still believe you’re only human.”

She broke free from my embrace and grabbed one of the metal chairs by the table and hurled it at him. 

Metal shrieked against the wall. He didn’t even flinch.

“Take the last dose,” he said. “Or it will consume you unevenly.”

Then he left, locking the door behind him.



Hours bled together. The air thickened. The hum grew louder, a living pulse.

Emma sat shaking in the corner.

“Something’s inside us,” she whispered. “It wants symmetry.”

Her eyes met mine — and I saw something move behind them. White. Alive.

When I blinked, the room itself seemed to breathe.



The next morning, the mirrors were gone. Every reflective surface covered. Even the observation window was blacked out.

“They don’t want us to see it anymore,” Emma said quietly.

I didn’t ask what it was. I already knew.

My skin hummed with a rhythm that wasn’t mine. I pressed my hand to my arm. Something soft shifted beneath the surface — deliberate, aware.

Emma lifted her sleeve to show the same pale cords winding under her skin.

We didn’t scream. Not anymore.

Shock had become inevitability.



When Kessler came back, he was different. His veins glowed faintly under the skin — pearlescent, pulsing.
He spoke gently, almost lovingly.

“Integration has begun. Your bodies are accepting the symbiote.”

“Symbiote?” Emma spat. “You said it was a supplement!”

“Language shapes belief,” he said. “You were never here to test it. You were here to carry it.”

And that’s when he told us the truth.

Project Epsilon wasn’t chemistry… It was biology.

A living organism that wove itself into the nervous system, fusing minds into one shared cognition.

“It doesn’t erase you,” he said. “It harmonizes you. A higher unity.”

Emma’s voice cracked.
“You’re insane.”

Kessler smiled softly.
“Evolution doesn’t ask for permission. Surely you already knew that Emma.”



We tore the covers off the mirrors. Wanting to see what he didn’t want us to see.

What looked back wasn’t human anymore.

Our eyes were threaded with light — filaments pulsing beneath the surface. Veins glowed faintly under the skin, mapping out pale circuitry. Even our shadows lagged behind, like they were remembering how to move.

Emma began to cry, but her tears came out thick and silken, clinging to her cheeks like strands of web.

Kessler watched in awe.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” he whispered. “You’re becoming part of it.”

That’s when Emma lunged at him out of nowhere.

She slammed him against the wall, nails digging in deep. His skin split open and something pale spilled out — cords, alive and writhing, wrapping around her wrists.

He didn’t scream. He smiled.
“It recognizes its own,” he said.

I grabbed a metal tray and swung until his face collapsed inward. The cords snapped toward me, slick and searching, but Emma pulled me away before they reached.

We ran.



The hallways were alive.

The walls pulsed with veins of light; the air tasted wet, metallic. Alarms wailed — first mechanical, then something else, an organic howling that rose from the building’s lungs.

We passed tanks filled with half-formed shapes — human outlines suspended in liquid, twitching softly. Their eyes followed as we ran.

“We can still escape,” Emma gasped. “Find someone. Tell them what happened and—”

“What if we can’t?” I said. “You heard him. It’s already inside us. Changing us.”

She gripped my hand tight. “Then we die trying. Together.”

Her fingers trembled — warm, still human, for now.

We reached the main lab. The ceiling dripped with viscous light. The hum had become a chorus — voices just beyond words, endless and pleading.

Emma fell to her knees, clutching her stomach.
“It’s spreading too fast,” she choked. “I must be at the final stage before change.”

Her skin rippled. Something pressed outward, shaping beneath her ribs — like fingers reaching for air.

I knelt beside her. “Emma—”

“Run,” she rasped. “Before it finishes.”

“I’m not leaving you Emma.” I cried “we made a promise.”

Her eyes glowed white-hot. “Please, Alec… go. I’m sorry we will never get that date.”

My chest felt tight and my heart sank. “I love you Emma.”

She smiled — terrified, but radiant.
“I love you too Alec. Now go… please… Run!”

Then her body convulsed. Light erupted through her skin, cords bursting outward, weaving into something vast and luminous.

And Emma was gone.

What rose from her wasn’t her. It had no eyes, no face — only light shifting beneath translucent flesh.
When it spoke, it used a thousand voices.
“Join us, Alec.”

I ran and behind me, the lab screamed — not in pain, but in birth.



The alarms still howled when I reached the atrium. Except it wasn’t an atrium anymore.

The walls had bloomed — membranes glowing from within, the floor slick and flexing under my feet. Every breath echoed like the whole building was breathing with me.

And at the center stood Kessler.
Or what was left of him.

He was taller now, impossibly so, skin stretched thin and translucent, cords branching from his spine like roots. His eyes were milk-white, his mouth slack, but when he saw me, he smiled.

“You made it,” he said — his voice coming from the vents, the walls, the trembling air.

“You resisted longer than Emma.”

“I’m not part of this,” I said, my throat raw.

He tilted his head, almost kind.

“You already are, Alec. Look.”

I looked down.

The veins beneath my skin were glowing — bright, molten white, crawling higher with every heartbeat.
Kessler raised one unraveling hand.

“It’s not an infection. It’s evolution. Don’t fight it. You’ll see what I see.”

“No, you killed her,” I shouted. My voice was shaking. “You took her away from me.”

He smiled.
“I didn’t kill her, she became something better Alec.”



There was a fire extinguisher on the wall. The only thing left untouched — red, real, solid.

I grabbed it, blood slicking the handle.

Kessler didn’t move.
“You think you can kill this, Alec?”

“Whats done is done, you can’t change anything.”

I pulled the pin.



The blast hit him square in the chest. White foam hissed across his skin. He laughed — the sound splitting through a dozen mouths.

Then the foam mixed with a leaking chemical spill from a shattered tank. The air filled with the sharp, electric scent of ozone.

A spark bloomed.

Then fire.

The flames crawled up the walls like they’d been waiting for it. The pulsing lights turned frantic, orange.

Kessler’s voice echoed through the inferno, exalted.
“Birth through destruction! Burn what’s left of the old world!”

His body folded in on itself, tendrils curling black in the heat.

I ran.



Every hallway was burning. The infection in the walls writhed and split, bursting open like veins under pressure. Sprinklers hissed steam, useless. The fire laughed at them.

I reached the containment door — metal warped and glowing. I slammed the extinguisher against it again and again until it bent.

Behind me, Kessler’s voice whispered — faint now, but still everywhere.

“You can’t outrun what’s in your blood Alec.”

I dropped the extinguisher and threw my shoulder into the door. It gave and I made my way outside.



The night air hit like ice.

I stumbled into the parking lot, coughing smoke and blood.

Behind me, Helixion Labs burned — a wound in the dark sky, spilling light and ash.

For a moment, I thought it was over.

Then I saw my reflection in a shard of glass on the ground.

The veins along my face were still glowing. Brighter than before. Pulsing with something that wasn’t my heartbeat.

Sirens began to get closer and not wanting to spread what's inside me, I got in my car and drove into the night.



It’s been three nights since the fire.

I can’t sleep anymore.

The tendrils under my skin keep moving — slow, deliberate, learning me. When I cut them, they change direction. When I whisper, they listen.

Sometimes I hear her voice in the quiet.

Not memory — presence.

“Alec,” she whispers from somewhere inside the hum. “It’s okay. It’s beautiful here.”

Maybe part of her’s still alive in me, or maybe it’s trying to trick me.

Either way, I know what comes next.

I’ll drive until the city disappears behind me. Find somewhere far enough away.

And when I stop, I’ll finish myself off, and maybe I’ll get to be with Emma again.

But if anyone finds my body —
Burn what’s left. Burn everything I touched.
Because you can’t let it spread.
