The cold does not forgive. It does not forget. The snow holds the smoke of burned villages, the stink of blood, and the cries that died in the throats of men and women when the rifle cracked. Each flake that drifts down tonight whispers of the things he has done, and when his boots crush the white crust beneath him, he imagines he is grinding the bones of the dead deeper into the earth.

He trudges through the gates of the camp, a man half-frozen, burdened by his rifle and the ragged scraps of gear slung across his back. The barbed wire sags, half-buried in the snow. The watchtowers loom empty, their frames creaking when the wind pushes through them. Rows of barracks stand hollow, the doors hanging loose from shattered hinges. A place abandoned by both jailers and prisoners, nothing more than a coppery carcass of war. The soldier’s breath rasps in the cold. His hands ache from gripping his rifle, but his mind aches more from the things that his rifle has done. His comrades had gone ahead. The captain had told him to check for stragglers, and he had nodded, though he could not have said why. There was no life left in this place.

The soldier had lived in camps like this one, slept in huts with lice and fire smoke choking the rafters, seen men starved down to their skulls and the hollow frames of horses beaten until they gave out in the snow. He knew what he would see before he crossed the gate and ducked beneath the fallen beam where the eagle still spread its wings in an iron silhouette against the pale sky.

Once, in another life, he had been a farmer’s son. His hands had turned soil instead of pulled triggers. Once, his mother’s voice had sung him lullabies about saints and angels. Once, the Motherland had demanded his obedience and pressed him into the ranks with promises of glory, of honor, of defending sacred soil against the beast of fascism. 

Once, he had obeyed. He had dragged villagers into the street and shot them for hiding bread. He had driven bayonets into bellies and throats because his orders left no room for mercy, not for sympathizers. He had held the torch, the rafters of the barn groaning as the fire licked them clean, the sounds of crying children echoing from the lofts. He had turned his back before the roof fell. The flames would purify them, take them from their war. There was no room for innocence in war. He had pushed a young woman to her knees, her hair tangled with mud and her eyes wide with terror. She had hidden a deserter. She had prayed in German as the trigger pulled once more. Her blood had spattered his boots, and when he wiped it away, the leather shone a polished sheen.

Now, those boots carry him across the deserted compound, crunching softly in the frozen dirt. His stomach burns with emptiness, yet he feels heavier with each step. A door creaks as it swings wider in the wind, and a figure lurches forward from the shadows. The uniform is German. It is gray, worn thin at the elbows, and spattered with filth. The boy is gaunt, his eyes hollow, and his cheeks as sunken as the soldier’s. The boy staggers out into the open, clutching a pistol with trembling hands. For a moment, they stare at one another. The boy lifts the pistol and fires.

Fire explodes in the soldier’s gut as the shot cracks across the compound. The pain is white-hot, spreading like liquid flame through his belly, warm blood seeping into the snow like spilled soup. His legs nearly buckle, but his years of killing drive his rifle up, closing his finger down on the trigger.

The thunderous report sends the boy stumbling into the snow, the pistol falling from his grip. The soldier sways where he stands, clutching at his stomach’s ruin. A burning heat seeps between his frigid fingers, the first warmth he’s felt in weeks. He forces himself forward, staggering toward the fallen enemy. Each step jars his wound, sharp pain clawing higher between his ribs.

The boy lies face-up, his eyes wide as his mouth mumbles something in German. His chest rises and falls shallowly, the breath steaming weakly in the frozen air. The soldier drops to his knees, grimacing against the agony tearing through him. His gloved hands fumble through the boy’s pockets. Half-hidden by the boy’s stained collar, the soldier finds a chain. Tugging it free, he sees an old iron key dangling from the end. The boy’s face contorts in horror, meeting the soldier’s eyes. With considerable effort, he speaks.

“Нe открывайте… дверь.”

*Don’t open the door.*

The soldier sets the key in the melting snow and resumes digging through the boy’s pockets. To his delight, he finds hard bread and a scrap of jerky. As the boy’s last breath steams into the frigid air, the soldier devours the bread in greedy bites, nearly choking it down, though bile threatens to rise with every chew.

He frantically searches the boy’s satchel, but finds nothing but the key lying in the snow beside him. The soldier closes his fist around it, feeling the teeth press into his palm as the snow swirls through the camp, piling against the wire fences and the empty towers. He rises slowly, the wound in his gut burning with every breath. The key is warm against his palm as he limps forward, his pulse pounding like a war drum in his ears.

The soldier’s ragged breath is the only sound as he approaches the administrative house. It is two stories of brick, with the upper windows blown out. The doors swing open freely, and the walls are papered with lists, names typed in clean German script, a roll-call of the damned. The soldier did not read them, for he had long ago given up on naming the dead.

In the rear of the house, a stair descended downwards. He paused at the threshold, struck by a smell not of ash or filth but of stone, wet and old, coiling upward like smoke. The soldier put his hand to the wall as he made his way down, one step at a time, the wood groaning under his weight. At the bottom was a door, iron-plated and bolted thrice. A small viewing slit was cut at the center like a gun port. He had seen doors like this in penal camps, deep in the Motherland, where the men who went in were never again named among the living. 

The soldier raised the bolt and peered through. A man stared directly back at him, eye-level with the slit. His hair hung black to his shoulders, his skin pale and without blemish. He was completely naked, his body lithe but not wasted, untouched by cold though the air bit through the soldier’s coat and stung the exposed flesh.

The prisoner regarded him without blinking. He did not cower or call out in fear. The prisoner spoke first, and his voice was in the tongue of the Motherland, fluent and smooth.

“Hello, my friend. That’s a nasty wound you have there.”

The soldier stared at him for a long time.

“Who are you?”

“Once I was a musician. My hands drew sound out of wood and string, and men wept to hear it. They said it was beautiful, but beauty has no place in the world of tyrants, so they cast me out. They feared not my crime, but my music. When I would not bow, they chained me here.”

The soldier thought of the boy upstairs, of his mouth bubbling blood and the words in his broken tongue.

“The boy told me not to free you.”

The prisoner laughed lightly. “The German? You believe the word of such men? You know their hatred, you’ve seen it. They would rather burn a book than read it. They would rather break a violin than hear it played. Men of war despise music. They shoot the bugler first, before he can sound the voice of victory. It is the oldest cowardice.”

He stepped closer to the slit, and his eyes flitted from the cross around the soldier’s neck to the key in his bloodied hand. 

His smile softened further. “I see what burdens you.”

The soldier said nothing.

“You think you are damned, don’t you? But you are Soviet. In the Motherland, the State comes before your God. You wear His sign, but you wear it for shame, not for faith. You have carried out every cruelty commanded of you, but not once have you knelt. Not once have you lifted your voice to Him, and now you fear damnation, but there is no Devil waiting for you. You have seen men do to one another what no devil could devise. The camps, the ovens, the piles of bones. If the Devil were real, he would only be an apprentice to man. No, there is only men and what they make of one another.”

He leaned against the iron calmly, his bare skin against the freezing metal, and it did not bite him.

“Did He send an angel to stop your bullets, to turn away the fire? Where was he? Was He listening?”

The soldier’s lips parted but no words came.

The prisoner shook his head slowly. “No. He was not here. He has not been here for a long, long time.”

The soldier coughed weakly. “I still believe.”

The prisoner’s brows arched upwards in surprise.

“Do you?” He said. “Even now? After all you’ve done?”

“I believe.”

The prisoner studied him for a moment. 

“You are stranger than I thought. To confess belief and live as one damned. To wear the cross and yet kneel to no command but the gun. Do you know what I see when I look at you? A man of faith, yes, but a man who has sinned so greatly that faith itself is your torment. You have done so many terrible things, committed so many sins in the name of your State, but what have you done in the name of your God?”

The soldier closed his eyes, shuddering as chunks of his flesh dripped onto the stone floor and hissed, steam curling upwards.

“You are dying,” the prisoner said gently, his words like a father’s chiding. “You know it. Do you think Heaven awaits you as you are? No. Listen to me. There is no penance to be found in the pits of hell. Only here and now, in this cell. This is purgatory, soldier. And you stand at its gate.”

The soldier lifted his head. His hand shook with the key clenched inside it, his vision blurring at the edges. The blood loss was making his head swim. He thought of the desperation in the boy’s eyes as he died.

“I don’t trust you,” the soldier muttered.

“Nor should you. Trust is a thing for children,” the prisoner said. “But listen. Listen instead to what you know already. One act, one kindness before the dark takes you. Free me, let me go out into the snow. Let me breathe the air again, feel the bow in my hand, hear the strings sing. And you will take my place. You will enter willingly, as Christ entered Gethsemane. A cell for a soul, iron for Heaven.”

The soldier’s vision tinged red as more of his ruination fell onto the floor, a wet sound erupting from his stomach as his hand swayed weakly, no longer clasping the wound.

“Think of it,” the prisoner urged. “Your sins washed not by torment, but by sacrifice. Your last act can be one of mercy. And when you pass beyond, I will lift the bow and sound your welcome at the gates. Your God will not deny you then.”

The soldier felt the room sway as the prisoner reached through the slit and laid a pale hand against his shoulder. His touch was impossibly warm, like flesh lit from within. “Come. Give me the key.”

The soldier’s hand trembled. His blood smeared across the brass, mixing with the boy’s. He reached up and slid the key into the lock. The iron teeth caught, the bolt ground back, and the heavy door opened with a sigh.

The prisoner stepped out slowly, his bare feet soundless on the stone. His body filled the space, the room twisting and swaying as the walls bent around him. For a moment, he seemed far taller and older than any man, a cold light flickering in his eyes. As he passed, his shoulder brushed against the soldier’s, and he smelled not damp nor rot, but a sweetness he had not known since childhood.

The soldier staggered into the cell, clutching his mortality in his hands as the prisoner ascended the icy steps, the light reflecting off his pale form. The soldier pulled the door closed as the footsteps from above quietly faded. The bolts fell one by one as he slumped to the corner where the prisoner had sat, setting his back against the stone and laying his frozen arm against his ruined stomach. A shuddering gasp escaped his lips as viscous chunks of blood pooled beneath him, cooling upon the paved stones.

He thought of nothing. Not the dead, not the State, nor the face of God. 

He thought only of the cold.
