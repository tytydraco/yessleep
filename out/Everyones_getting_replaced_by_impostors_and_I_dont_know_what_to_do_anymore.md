It's very interesting how people perceive each other. The way in which I see myself is not how my best friend Wes sees me, or my other best friend Andy. Nor is the way that they see each other or me the same. We see each other differently, and not just because they're in different friend groups. Even my friends, say, Wes and Beck. We're all in the same friend group, and yet I see Beck differently than Beck sees Beck, or Wes sees Beck. We all have hundreds of different versions of ourselves, all perceived differently by different people. 

That's kind of a random ramble, I know. But I started thinking about it when I realized that Beck was not in fact Beck. 

I've known him for ten years, since we were 6. I can recognize him from a crowd of teenagers from his voice alone. But he's not him. No one's noticed except for me and Wes. Wes only because they're twins. 

It might not be that big a deal- so a teenager changed overnight, so what? That's pretty much par for the course. It's fine, except it's not just Beck. Cyndi, from my other friend group has been acting strangely too.

A side note to explain something which might not make sense, I have two friend groups, Andy and the other drama kids and Wes and the other sports kids. Oversimplifying it a tad, but that's the basics of it. And, like other people with multiple friend groups, I act differently for them. In the sports group, we all pretty much endlessly make fun of each other, and in the drama one, even the lightest teasing causes, well- drama. And as far as I know, I'm the only bridge in these groups, seeing as the drama group is a cross-school program and I'm the only one from my school, and the sports team is the school's.

Anyway. Back to Cyndi and Beck. They both have been acting strange, and weirder still, the same kind of strange. They pause a moment before speaking- not so weird for Cyndi because she's kind of quiet, but Beck will not shut up or stop to think. He gets in so much trouble for it. Recently, though, he's paused. And I've noticed he glances around at everyone he's talking to before talking. I know, I know, maybe he's just trying to be more thoughtful, but, no hate to the guy, he's never been thoughtful a day in his life.

Max and I share our 5th period math. Afterward, I have study hall with Wes. During study hall, I sat next to Wes.

"Hey, is Beck okay? He seems off."

He looked at me in surprise. "You noticed too? He's been weird since yesterday."

"Did anything happen?"

He screws up his face, thinking. "Well...we went hiking." I nodded. They loved hiking. "He twisted his ankle, so I went back down to get a ranger because he was complaining so much. When I got back, he was standing and actually, like, bouncing on his toes. Weird, right?"

I nodded. Everyone on the soccer team joked about Beck. If an opponent so much as brushed against him, he'd flop. If he got a bruise, he'd be whining about it the entirety of practice. According to Wes, if he twisted his ankle, he should have been sprawled across the trail, lamenting about his ankle to everyone who passed by. 

"Even weirder," Wes continued, "He started being super disrespectful to the ranger. Like, taunting him and stuff. Then once the ranger left, he turned to me like nothing happened and asked if we were gonna keep going. I asked him about his ankle, and he was like 'Oh yeah.' and collapsed onto the ground, grabbing his ankle again- the wrong ankle, by the way."

I frowned. Beck, for all his complaining and impulsivity, was always respectful to authority figures, even if they were in the wrong. And he kept careful track of what he had injured so he could fake it and complain better. "You know..." I said slowly, remembering about Cyndi. "The same thing happened in my drama class yesterday. This girl Cyndi, she's usually a big role because she's a good actress. But she kept flubbing her lines and was waay overacting. Then, when Andy started feeding her her lines, she miraculously remembered and turned into the world's greatest actress or something. I came up to her and asked if she was okay, and she seemed normal again, but like...I don't know. Something was off. I have the same feeling about Beck."

Wes nods. "We should keep an eye on them. See what could be wr-"

"Wesley! Calanthe! Stop talking!" Ms. Jones snaps, and we both straighten up and nod.

"Talk later." Wes whispers to me.

During lunch, we tried to talk, but then Beck came over and sat next to me with too big a smile. We tried again to talk at practice, but coach caught us and made us do pushups until it felt like my arms were gonna fall off. Afterward, I had to go to drama, so we couldn't talk then, but Andy came to me with her own suspicions. Apparently it wasn't just Cyndi and Beck. One of her other friends had been acting strange too. We tried to avoid Cyndi, which was hard because I'm playing her sister.

She came up to me after a scene. "Hey, am I doing something wrong? You're avoiding me like the plague!"

I shook my head. "Just trying out some different blocking."

She nods. "Well, you can come closer if you want, it won't kill you!" She laughs, and the sound is so...off somehow that I instinctively back away, smiling uneasily.

As soon as the scene is over, I scurry back to Andy, who's working with the lights. 

"I think something's definitely wrong, it sounded like she was threatening me just now." I twisted a strand of hair.

"What? What'd she say?"

"Well...I might be overreacting. She said that I could come closer and that it wouldn't kill me, but I don't know, the way she said it sounded weird, like she was threatening me? I don't know, I'm probably just overreacting-"

"No, no, it's okay. If you say it's weird, I believe you. So I might have an idea on what's-"

Cyndi was standing in the doorway, smiling really creepily. I hadn't noticed her until she called out "Oh, Alexandria!" She said it in a weird singsong, like A-lex-AN-dri-aaaa, which was weird on it's own, but coupled with the unnervingly wide smile made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. 

"It's not nice to spread rumors." She continued with a little pout, reaching down and grabbing a long cord from the ground. Andy made a little squeak, probably thinking about what would go wrong with the cable missing, but I was more interested in what Cyndi was going to do with it. 

I grabbed Andy's hand. "Run." I whispered, and as Cyndi lunged for us, I yelled it again, taking off through the door, half pulling half dragging Andy behind me. Cyndi growled and took off after us. I was pretty much sprinting now. I knew that Andy drove herself, and her car was outside.

"Get your keys ready." I said breathlessly to her, continuing to pull her along. She nodded, already reaching into her pocket. 

"Back lot." She says, then yelps. I feel a pull from the opposite direction, so strong I could have sworn one of my soccer mates had grabbed me. I struggle forward, breaking free, still with Andy's arm in my hand. 

We burst out the back door, Andy frantically unlocking her car door. I run around it and let go of her, throwing myself into the backseat. Andy was already turning on the car, locking the doors, and she peeled out of the lot with a screeching of tires. Breathing heavily, I turned around, looking out the back window. I saw Cyndi in the parking lot. She threw down the cord and screamed in frustration. She glared at the retreating car, and I think she saw me peeking out, because she switched to an unnerving grin and waved goodbye.

Andy dropped me off at home and I've been barricaded in my room since. What should I do? Has anyone encountered something similar? I'm so scared. I'm going to call Wes as soon as I post this to talk to him about what happened tonight. I'll try to update if I can, but I really don't know what I'm going to do.
