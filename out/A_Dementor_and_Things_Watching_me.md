I struggled with sleep paralysis for years during college but never really saw anything until I was 22. I was living with a roommate, and sharing a room with him.  
  
One night I "woke up" at least felt like I did and saw what I can only describe as a dementor from Harry Potter. It's been 10 years, but I remember it hovering above my roommate's bed, but as soon as I looked, it turned and locked onto me. The air felt unusually cold, and the room seemed to darken, amplifying my fear. I couldn't move or scream, but remember fully waking up screaming.  
  
Needless to say, I scared the shit out of my roommate and also pissed him off. I chalk it up to a crazy case of sleep paralysis but an extreme case. Swear on my life this is how I remember it, and it felt super real physically and visually.  
  
I have had sleep paralysis so many times I have lost count, and only "visually" have seen something one other time that was creepy; it was 8 years later and less pressing. Might as well tell you about that one.  
  
I moved into a old renovated apartment building about 3 years ago, and was there alone. It was the first night and I had just finished moving my stuff in. After some TV or games, I went to bed. I always close my bedroom door before bed, but I don't think I locked it, I can't remember.  
  
I remember having a dream and it wasn't too crazy feeling-wise, but I remember someone staring at me through my cracked bedroom door. I only remember the face was dark and bright eyes, but don't think they were red. The dream was vivid like awake sitting up in the bed of that room I just moved in, looking at the door.  
  
At that point, it startled me when I realized what was happening and it jolted me awake. Well, my door was cracked open. I am 100% sure I closed it like I said, 100%. I have had so many experiences that I brushed it off, and for the 3 years I lived there I never had another incident.  
  
Later I asked my landlord if he had heard of anyone experiencing anything weird in the apartments. He said he had multiple different tenants on the opposite side of the building hear some footsteps in an empty apartment upstairs, but never on my side of the building. What's weird is he would have people move into that apartment and they would never say anything, but when it was empty, the people below would complain about loud running, or dancing footsteps upstairs.  
  
They were always very surprised to hear that he noone lived in that one or that he hadn't been in there doing renovations. It was usually later. Since I switched from a back to a stomach sleeper, I rarely have episodes anymore. Anyone else experience anything similar, or am I just fueling nightmares.
