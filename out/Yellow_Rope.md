I grew up in a fairly rural area of Virginia. As a kid, I had an obsession for dirt bikes. Watching motocross on TV, the X-games, reading Racer-X magazines, it was all I thought about. So, when my mom and dad bought me my first dirt bike one Christmas, I was ecstatic. From that moment, my days were consumed with riding that thing. As soon as I got home from school until sundown, you can bet I was in the woods riding.

Right behind my parents’ house was a huge expanse of woods. There was a trail that ran virtually the entire length of our neighborhood. It was a point-to-point trail, with a few turns, hills and jumps. It would take about 15 minutes on my dirt bike to ride the length of the trail from end to end. There were no other trails, just this one long trail. When I got to the end, I would just turn around go back the other way. I would ride back and forth for hours, every day. I ended up learning that trail like the back of my hand; where every tree root was, where every turn was, where every rut was, you get the picture.

When I was 13, I started having this reoccurring dream. I would be riding my dirt bike along that familiar trail, when suddenly, there would be a new intersection. A brand-new trail to go down. I would ride down it and come to a large clearing in the woods. In my dream, I had this feeling that when I got to the clearing, I was supposed to be looking for something, finding something there. But every time I got to the clearing, I would wake up. This reoccurring dream continued until I was 14.

I left my house one afternoon, hopped on my dirt bike, and began another afternoon of riding back and forth on the trail. I rode for around an hour, when it happened. I was heading up a small hill, mindlessly by this point, knowing everything to expect. Coming over the hill, I saw it, the intersection. I locked my rear brakes, causing the rear end to slide sideways slightly. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Was this real? I sat there for several minutes, my bike’s motor idling, staring down the trail. A thousand thoughts raced through my head. How was this possible? Was it always here? Looking down the trail, I couldn’t see the end. It went straight for about 50 yards, but I couldn’t make out what was at the end. It was as if I couldn’t focus on it clear enough, it was just a straight trail. It matched exactly what was in my dream. 

I decided not to go down it, almost not believing it was really there. I told myself that, if it was there again tomorrow, then I’ll go down it. The next day came, and I again ventured out in the woods. I rode straight to the spot where I saw the new trail, fully expecting it to be gone. But, sure enough, there it was again. I made the turn at the intersection, and slowly began riding down the trail.

I drove down the trail, staying in 3rd gear, slow and steady. The trail was completely straight, and it only took me about a minute to reach it. The clearing. The exact clearing I always saw in my dreams. Dumbfounded. I stopped, put my kickstand down, turned off the motor, and got off my bike. I took off my helmet, looking around. “What the fuck” I whispered to myself. The clearing itself was a perfect circle, around 50 feet in diameter. It was surrounded by dense forest, minus the single trail leading to it.

I couldn’t make sense of this. I thought I was losing my mind. I walked around the circle, confused, contemplating what it all meant, and looking around for answers. I began to feel an eerie feeling, as if I was being watched. A feeling of dread, and danger. I felt as if, I was suddenly somewhere I was very much not supposed to be. “Fuck this”, I said. I threw my helmet back on, not bothering to buckle it, and and kick-started my dirt bike, bringing life back to the motor. I peeled back down the trail, shifting gears and hauling ass back home.

 I rode for a few minutes, when it hit me. Why the hell is it taking so long to get back? It took less than a minute to reach the clearing, yet I’ve been riding down this trail for what I felt like was several minutes, and I hadn’t met back up with my familiar trail.

I started to panic, getting disoriented. I told myself, “maybe I’m going the wrong way”. I knew it didn’t make sense, but I was willing to try anything to get out of there. I spun the bike around, and within about 10 seconds, I made it back to the clearing. “FUCK!” I said. I peeled around again, back down the trail. Again, I rode, and rode, never making it back to the intersection. I stopped, got off my bike, feeling defeated, confused, and scared. I threw my helmet and collapsed next to a tree, sobbing. On my knees, I let out a frustrated and terrified scream. I sat there, trying to think of what to do, I’m not sure how long I sat there for. It felt like hours. I could see the sun dropping in the sky, the woods getting dimmer. I started to feel like I was never going home. I closed my eyes, and somehow, probably out of mental exhaustion, fell asleep with my back against a tree.

I’m not sure how long I slept for. I woke up, immediately jumping to my feet, wildly looking around and quickly gathering my bearings. The sun was shining brightly, and I was back on the trail. MY trail. My blessed familiar trail. The intersection and the new trail was still there, but I was out. Quickly, I jumped on my bike, riding as fast as I could to get home. I had no idea how long I was gone for, and thought my parents were probably worried sick. Exiting the woods by my house, I parked my bike, and ran inside. “Hi, Honey”, my mom said. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened, I..I lost track of time”, I managed to get out. “Well it’s only been an hour, I’m surprised your already back inside”, my mom said. I stood there, mouth agape, staring at my mom. “You…okay?” mom my asked, a look of concern growing on her face. I forced out an awkward smile, “I’m fine, just not feeling well”. I went to my room, a million questions running through my mind.

I spent the next few days confused, replaying every moment through my head. I wanted to just make sense of everything, to have some logical reason, but, there just wasn’t one. I devised a plan that, looking back, was incredibly stupid, but I couldn’t live with not knowing what the hell happened to me in those woods.

My dad was a bit of a tool coinsurer. Any tool, hardware, rope, bungee cords, he was your guy. Among his collection, he had a giant spool of yellow polypropylene rope, around 600 feet of it. I decided, I was going to use the rope, tie it to a tree at the intersection, and then ride back down the trail to investigate. The rope would serve as my “lifeline”, helping guide me back when I was ready to leave. That day, I went back out. 

Getting to the trail intersection, I tied one end of the rope around my waist and used several bungee cords to tie the spool to a tree, giving me slack but staying secured to the tree. I headed back down the trail.

Feeling a new boost confidence and determination, I rode back down the trail, and quickly arrived back to the clearing. I kept one hand on the knot on my waist, being sure it stayed there. I got off my bike, leaving it idling, and walked into the middle of the circle. I started to get that erie feeling again, as if being watched. I shook it off, a new feeling of bravery. I felt determined to discover what it was I we supposed to find, and what the point of all of this was. I forced down the feeling of dread. Scanning the clearing, I suddenly became fixated on one tree in particular. This tree was darker than the rest, almost looking.. burned. I got closer to it, flakey black scorch marks covered the tree.

I was staring at the tree, almost feeling stuck in place, when suddenly, something began slowly peeking its head out from behind it. The face was black, burned, decayed, inhuman, like a bad imitation of a human. It had short wirey black hair that looked oily and covered in soot. As soon as its eyes met mine, my dirt bikes motor shut off. The sudden silence caused me to turn around to look at my bike, then I quickly turned back. The thing was gone. The woods were silent. For a split second, I froze, until instinct in my body kicked in and told me to get the fuck out of there. I sprinted back to my bike, kick started it harder than I ever had. I half expected it to not start, but, to my relief, it actually started. I left my helmet behind. Riding as fast as I could, the image of the thing's eyes burned in my mind. A shade of orange, like fire, looking into them had made me feel as if I was being sucked into an endless black pit.

In my haste to leave, I made a fatal mistake. Having walked a good ways past my bike into the clearing, I had created too much slack in the rope when heading back in the opposite direction. I was shifting gears, going faster, faster, when suddenly, the rope caught my chain. My rear wheel locked, and I was sent over the handbars. Although in pain, I got to my feet as quickly as I could, dirty, limping, a burning pain in my ribs. The rope was still tied around my waste, but it had somehow been severed in the crash. Frantically, I looked around for the rest of the rope, the end that would lead be back, but it was just.. gone. I ran back to my bike, trying desperately to get the pieces of rope out of my chain and sprocket. When I saw it. Movement from the corner of my eye. I stopped, froze, looking in the direction of the movement. I then saw more movement, again, out of the corner of my eye. It was as if it was anticipating my moves, staying just out of eyesight, darting between the trees.

I took off running down the trail, abandoning my bike. My adrenaline was pumping, and I knew I was running for my life. I then spotted the yellow rope. The beautiful yellow rope. “YES!” I screamed, running as quickly as I could toward it, following it to salvation. But, the rope began retracting, dragging on the ground, back up the trail. “NO!” I screamed, running as fast as I could toward it. I ran after it, as it seemed to run away from me. I was hoping to see the intersection, praying to see the intersection, and then I did.

I reached the intersection, crying, heaving, trying and failing to catch my breath. For a second, I felt pure relief for making it out alive. But, I noticed something. The yellow rope. The spool was no longer bungeed to the tree. The rope now led to behind the tree.

Slowly, it stepped out from behind the tree, revealing itself in its entirety. It was the thing from the clearing. The woods went silent. A feeling of pure dread came over me. It had a look of pure malice in its gaze and a terrible smile as it continued to gather up the rest of the yellow rope. I was frozen in fear. I felt as if I was in ice water, I couldn’t catch a breath, couldn’t scream.

I can only describe what I saw as a distorted imitation of a human. Black, charred, its form twisted and contorted into a grotesque mockery of life. Its eyes were pools of endless darkness, devoid of empathy or humanity, gleaming with an ancient predatory intelligence. It began to move toward me, slowly. Its steps were silent, as if the ground itself recoiled from the touch of its feet. The air around me grew cold, and carried the stench of decay. With each movement, its body shifted and rippled, as if it was struggling to contain its own shape.

Its presence filled me with overwhelming dread, a primal fear that seized my entire being. Its voice was a twisted mixture of a whisper and a scream. I felt as if its gaze seeped into my mind, into my very being, turning my thoughts into twisted and nightmarish desires. As it approached closer and stood over me, I knew I was going to die. Everything went black.

I woke up back on my familiar trail. The intersection was gone, the rope was gone, no trace of anything was left. In shock, and in pain, I walked back home. 

In the end, I told my parents I had crashed my dirt bike, and wasn’t strong enough to push it back home. My dad went back into the woods to look for it, but never found it. I didn’t care, I was never going to touch another dirt bike for the rest of my life.

Since then, everything was felt different. I felt like something was missing in me, as if that thing took something from me. I felt unable to enjoy anything, unable to have relationships, unable to care. I couldn't sleep, I didn’t feel tired, I couldn’t feel anything. I didn’t know what to do, I just felt like.. a shell.

That Christmas, my family and I were getting ready to leave for a Christmas tree farm, and annual tradition that used to bring me excitement. My parents were trying their best. They saw the change in me, everyone did. Putting on brave faces, my parents asked me if I was excited to pick out our tree. I wasn’t excited. I couldn’t be excited about anything anymore. “Sure” I said, trying my best to sound convincing. 

Before we left, my dad was digging in the garage looking for something. “Hey bud, have you seen my yellow rope?” The question sent me into a flashback of full terror, leaving me screaming, sobbing, and begging for help, begging for it to stop. From then on, I spent years in and out of therapy and institutions. I'm an adult now, but I’ve never shaken the feeling of pure emptiness. I decided I’m going to go back to my childhood home, back to that familiar trail that I can still remember like the back of my hand. If the intersection is there, I am going to down it. I’m going to kill that thing and get back the piece of myself it took. If it kills me, taking the rest of me, so be it. Either way, I’m going to be free of this.
