  

Wait! Did I just forget what happened after dinner? I woke up in the morning at my bed with nothing strange, but when did I laid on bed? Why my feet are so dirty? Why that part of the time just got erased out of my memory? 

Did I go out in my sleep? My hands were also dirty! It’s like I had played with mud or something. My roommate was sleeping that time like a dead man so he couldn’t see anything of last night. The door was also locked from inside like usual. 

Same thing kept happening. Every day I woke up with dirty feet and hands. Still can’t remember what happened after dinner.

That day my roommate said, he has to work at night on his laptop for an office project of his. We had dinner together at the table. Just after I took a piss my night dress and drank a glass full of water from that water-purifier, blankness filled that area of the memory until I woke up same as previous day states. 

This time however, I got at least some information from my roommate. Were those really true? Or, was he taking the advantage to deliver a complete story of weird somnambulism because I really had no memory of that time.

If that was the second thing, he could become a really successful suspense-writer. He told me at the morning, at the breakfast table without waiting for my asking. 

‘So… What was your business at the empty grounds?’, he asked me frowning.

‘I have no idea what are you talking about.’, I was surprised. 

‘You are the one who told me, when I asked you last-night.’, he looked a bit confused, ‘You unlocked the door after putting the empty glass on the table. When I asked you where you going, you told me you have some work to do at the nearby empty land. Now, please don’t act strange. I am curious about what can a man do at that time in an empty ground like that?’

How could I convince him that I really did not remember any of those events?

He waited for my answer but didn’t get any. At last, He added, ‘After nearly an hour around 12:30pm you returned with bare feet. I didn’t noticed whether or not you put your shoes on or not as I was in my room, working. But when you came back I saw you closely. You locked the door and went to the bed. Dude, your eyes were white!’

‘What? My eyes were what?’

‘Yeah! I saw clearly that, your pupil along with iris were white…. Or grey… I can’t tell exactly but it was something like that! You didn’t answered any of my questions that is why I am asking you now as you are looking much normal by now. Dude, what really happened?’

‘I had the same question to you, my friend.’

‘I did not follow you after you went outside. I couldn’t sleep last night, thinking about you. Are you doing some illegal actions over the grounds? Dude, tell me!’

Then I explained him how I was also completely unaware of my actions of that time for the last couple of days. I don’t know he believed me or not but gave me advice of visiting a doctor or something.

But where we lived there was no doctor’s place or alike nearby. Also, I don’t think a regular doctor who gives advice about physical illness only, can help me with my problem.

I worked at the factory as an accountant in the village. My parents lived in another village which was far away from here. I could only visit them twice in a year by travelling a healthy distance of a train-journey and foot-walk to the wooden and endangered paternal house of mine upon a small hill. 

My roommate, who had a bit more educational knowledge and conventional degree than me, was also older than me in age and had much better wealth background of his lineage than me. Then what was he doing here in an obscure village like this, you may ask? The answer was equally quite interesting and mind-boggling at the same time.

Unlike me, he could have got a very comfortable job at a crowded and popular town. But he had chosen this very strange and unbelievably noble job of his. Even though his exact type of job or sector was unknown to me or I should say beyond my understanding, he makes more money than my monthly salary, a good portion of which he spent for the education of the poor children of this village. 

We lived in this rental house for quite a cheap price, according to him. There’s no caretaker or guard to this house. There was no upper-storey. Two separate rooms, the doors of which we kept open most of the time an one comparatively big dining-cum-kitchen space along with the essential utensils, two chair and one table for four people made our so-called domestic life comfortable. The main gate at the space, we needed to lock every night as it was strictly prescribed by the property-owner. 

If you are curious about the land-lord too, then I have to say sorry to you because neither of me nor my roommate knew much about him. We just made contract through a local agent of this place and settled a deal.

‘Can you please follow me thin night when I go out? I swear, I am unconscious when I go out at night. I know that’s a weird request but still… It’s the only option to find out’, I pleaded to my roommate.

He agreed but that was not the big deal. The real astonishment happened to me afterwards when he explained me what he saw, following me to the grounds. I couldn’t find any logic to that bizarre story he told me next morning which was surprisingly none other than me.

‘When you left the room your feet were bare and eyes were white. You didn’t answer me as previous and walked to the ground like a machine. What you did there was utter madness. 

‘You approached a dark and healthy bush nearby and picked white stones from there. It seemed like you already gathered the stones for that night’s job of you, over there. Then I discovered you had already made a shape on the grassy land like a painting on a canvas by placing the stones on the land geometrically. 

‘You had created circles of same center. That covered some good amounts of radius as can be measured of the largest border. You started to make visible radiuses to the circles from same center with the remaining stones from the bush. 

‘Finally you stopped making those radiuses and it seemed like you finished that night’s job for the time. Then you returned and slept on the bed like a child.’

I was frowning at him. Then I made a statement which made sense.

‘If what you are saying is true, then the structure should still be on the ground.’

‘Yes, of course. Go see by yourself. Don’t turn your eyes white and act like robot though.’, he taunted. 

At the morning the ground was as empty and lonely as always. No children or men came here ever since we stayed in that house. No one comes here because of certain rural rumor about this place. Some say this place is cursed, some say this place has made few people disappear without any scientific explanation, some say this place possessed some dark powers which is harmful for anyone. It’s also very strange that there was no stray animal there. The whole place was as empty as void of infinite. 

Then I discovered the area of art on the grasses which was claimed to be created by my daily-night’s duty over here. The art upon the grass was totally matched with my roommate’s description.

What was this structure? Seemed like a complicated geometric shape drawn by placing the white un-even shaped stones precisely on the grass. Seemed like it created by ancient noble artist or some outer-earthy engineers. This type of structures could only be found the geometry book of the school-student as per my knowledge goes. 

I am just an accountant without any significant knowledge of geometry nor art neither demonic hexagram nor astrophysics. How did I make the creation was beyond my imagination. It was still true that, the time of creating this was completely absent from my head.

What was more horrific than that happened that night. It seemed like my drawing is done and I don’t felt anything strange like the nights when I went to ground to make structures. 

Just after when I laid on the bed after dinner I heard a strange and metallic voice inside of my head.

Yes, that’s right. INSIDE OF MY HEAD.

That was not my mind’s voice or anything that belonged to me but it addressed me by my name making me astonished to the wits’ end. 

‘You have to come with us. Come to the signal-area asap.’, the electronic voice which can’t be described as neither any men’s nor women’s nor children’s, started to repeat. 

My legs moved and I didn’t felt senses upon them. I stood up. 

Am I walking? It’s still dark inside the room. I think I was planning to sleep? Like any normal guy would do? Then why was I walking ? I took the keys and unlocked the main door. 

Where I am going? 

My bare feet touched the wet grassy land after some more automated walking. My eyes were blinded by the brightest light in that night . I saw nothing and remembered nothing until I opened my eyes at a complete unknown territory.

….

‘Wake up! Wake up!’, that unworldly voice made my eyes open. 

I was tied up in the chair which felt soft for not being made of some spongy material. The “ropes” was also felt organic to me. It’s a white and empty room and the lights were maybe too bright for my eyes.

I heard some voice in unknown and strenuous to the “tongue” or I should say “human tongue” languages. Those voices were literally heard by me from my head. It was by no means was announced inside the room. It got directly implanted to my brain. But still I remember cleanly, that nothing was attached to my head.

‘Hello. How are you feeling?’, the wobbling tongue voice said inside my head. 

When I tried to speak, I noticed that I can’t move my lips. It’s not like they had stick something like a piece of duct tape or something on my mouth, my face was clean and free. But, maybe it was like an anesthesia which made me unable to move my lips or the whole mouth and throat to make my voice completely absent. 

I moved my head and slapped my feet upon the cold floor. Maybe the voice saw me struggling. 

‘You don’t have to move your body parts to convey messages.’, it said.

‘Who are you?’, I spoke inside of my mind.

‘I am the only one who asks questions here.’

Where am I for the love of god? I couldn’t derive any information from that situation. Trapped in this bright white room surrounded by more than four walls as I can see in front of me, as I can’t see my behind area. I couldn’t even discover the bright light source in the room. I felt little light-weighted than usual. I was tied tightly by the soft ropes to the soft chair. 

‘Do you feel ok?’, it asked again. 

‘No’, I answered silently.

‘You will feel different soon. Just explain your feelings as you feel.’

‘The room is too bright for me?’

‘Too what?’

‘Too bright. The lights in the room are too bright.’

Silence…..  

‘Braittte? Can you say any synonyms of the word?’

‘I am no professor of English sir.’

‘Profaslar…. That word is not classified for us.’

‘Classified?’

‘Adjourned!’, then I remembered nothing.

…. ….

My sleep was again awakened by the same voice. But, this time however, I had something in front of me. 

The room was bright and white as usual. The things were placed on a… “table”…? I guess…. 

The sizzling hot beef-steak was still making hissing noises as it seemed to be served right after grilling freshly. The BBQ sauce on it, was making the sight uprising and the subtle green veg salad on the side of the plate was making it more tempting for my mouth. 

Except the plate there was a tumbler of some good quality Kentucky Straight Bourbon maybe around 60ml in quantity. The drink was neat and as elegant as the food.

I discovered my body free from any obstructions. The soft rope like thing was gone, allowing me to stand-up from the “chair” and roam around the room.

There was a glass-bottle filled with water. I drank from it as there was no glass. As I was approaching the “table” I felt like I needed to piss. I tried to inform that to my friend inside my head.

‘You will find a gate on your left.’, it answered. 

That door on the left which was almost blended with the wall with the same monotonous white color, revealed a toilet facility. 

Returning from the “toilet” I pulled my chair closer to the “table” and when I was about to start digging into the stake I found not fork or knife there. 

‘Where is the fork and knife? Without which I can’t eat the stake.’, I said inside me.

No answer was found. 

I could move my jaws though, but couldn’t make my voice to work. 

If I wanted to eat the stake and salad with my bare hand I had to wait for it to be a bit settled as it was sizzling hot at the time.

I started sipping the Bourbon instead. Already the sophisticated notes were more recognizable on my palate. 

I tore the mildly-warm stake with my bare fingers of both hands. Then my mouth was bursted with flavor. 

Soon the plate an tumbler were cleaned to empty. 

‘Sit on the chair.’, the voice directed.

Kind of like a robot I obeyed the order obediently as I honestly wanted to rest. Then I immediately lost into deep sleep after dropping myself on the chair.

…. …. ….

That time I was awakened by absolute intolerable pain of piercing on my skin. I couldn’t make a single sound out of me. I started to bang my feet on the ground and rubbed them against each other. I was tied this time more tightly than  the previous intervention but that was maybe securing me from happening something worse than this. I felt like a guinea-pig with the purpose of grievous experiments. 

The cause of pain was hellishly disturbing as I want to describe it. Metal chains with sparklingly pointing curved hooks in multiple numbers, was pierced into my both arms from both sides. I saw no one piercing those to me. Blood started to drip from me. The chains were connected and left loose on the ground. 

Then, the lengths of those chains started to shorten. The skin on my arm got pulled by those fish-hooks causing pain inside me. I started to shake my head frantically but no movement to the char was made because it was attached to the floor. 

Those chains straightened to the straightest line going to the limits of pulling and ripping my hooked skin. Then the pulling was stopped at the most painful point. My arms were covered with blood and I started to feel a bit cold. My whole body was shaking. 

What were “they” trying to do with me? Fear and pain destroyed my prudent thinking capacity at that time. 

How “they” look? Are “they” some hideous monstrous in size or are they tinier than germs and viruses? 

Where was I? What was the place? Did that belong to earth in any ways? 

I don’t know when exactly I fainted at the same position with same tormenting situation. 

What I remember vividly was that, even with the pain which caused every part of my body in certain motion, I couldn’t make a single sound out of my mouth.

…. …. …. ….

This time my eyes opened naturally without any noise or voice. My wounds seemed to be on the stage of healing by applying very effective medicine upon them, which I believe. Those piercing holes were in “good” conditions but no bandages were on my arm. 

I had to visit the “toilet” for number two this time. When I closed the door of the “toilet” and returned to my white prison, There was something which made my genitals hard. 

I was in the same night-dress which consisted of a wife beater vest and a pajama. But the other human being in the room was wearing nothing. 

A naked female with a very proud body was staring at me. She was must be in her early 20’s. The bright skin-tone and blonde hair were making her absolute messenger of heaven. Her eyes, which was the most mesmerizing thing in my entire life, hypnotized me within seconds. 

I touched and felt that tender breasts. I shoved my tongue into her mouth and she touched my pointy part of the pants. Then she undressed me and we started with simple positions. Neither of us made a sound out of our organic audio devises but skin-rubbing sounds was audible to the good ears.

Then from behind of her, I felt a natural urge to choke her with my right arm and move my hips faster than the starting speed. I had most  immense pleasure from that event than of my life so far. I reached climax multiple time but got recharged for another round in few moments, thanks to that seductive woman. 

When I was finally very tired she affectionately put me in the same old chair and I slept again. 

…. …. …. …. ….

‘Subject final test! Rise! Rise!’, it screamed inside my head with wobbling tongues.

I stood up from my sleep by the startling voice. And then…. Then I saw…. I saw the Robotic arms coming out from the white walls towards me. Six in the number, they clutched me evenly to each side of the body distributed as, two by each of my arms, two by ach side of my waste and two by each legs beneath my knees. They made my body make a big “X” held by those machines.

Those arms started to play with my body like I was a action figure toy like those they sold in the toy-shops for children by making flexible joints figuring the super-heroes from comic-books. 

“They” tried to pull my arms backwards beyond average human capacity causing me pain in my organic joints. They tried to stretch my legs and bend me forcefully. They played with me until I finally… Finally… Yes. I screamed. 

I screamed breaking my vocal-cord temporarily. No bones were broken though and no joints were damaged permanently. But they played with me considering me as their toy. 

At a point the arms stopped returning their starting positions holding me in “X”. I was tired and my eyes closed, ending this part of my remembrance. 

…. …. …. …. ….

I was found with wounds on my arms, fainted on the empty grounds by the locals. I couldn’t stand up at the time of coming to consciousness though. 

The pain in my bones, joints and muscle is still there and I am still bedridden. 

By the time I am writing this I am at a local village hospitals which has no efficient doctors and automatic machinery as compared to any popular town of any country, on this planet Earth.

I was missing for Ten Days from here. My roommate asked the villagers about me but found no information until they found me on the grounds.

I recall, I didn’t feel any weakness or appetite on the third, fourth and last intervention of them at the white chamber. I didn’t have any calculation of time there. 

Maybe “they” possessed some elements which allow “their subject” to keep in good shape. My body has got buffed up a little as my roommate pointed out with humor. 

He didn’t believe my stories though but he was only guardian over here which made me feel safe and comfortable.

I don’t care whether or not the readers of my story believe me. I am just a patient inside of a not very well maintained and cheap hospital from an unpopular and backward village, who just regained his capacity of reading the daily newspaper and writing his bizarre tory on a notebook with a blunt pencil.  

But the questions in my mind are still vivid in my deep memory. People didn’t see anything strange over the empty grounds where I ran my stone duty at nights.  No research was taken place in the poor village. 

I will never forget the hypnotic eyes of the girl who made me feel warmth of female flesh. I did whatever I wanted, with her. The sex was such an experience which made me feel like a real man for the first time. I dominated and got dominated evenly on that event. The softness of her skin still makes me arose when I think of her. 

The food, which they offer was beyond what I could ever effort by my skinny salary at those factories. But the devilish experiment which they ran on me was equally infernal compared to those. 

My arms are bandaged and I do not know when my muscles and joints will be cured. I am praying to the god as that never happens to anyone here in this village, where the empty grounds lies. 

“They”… What were “they”? What “they” wanted? Nobody will ever know.
