I want to start this by saying, I do not want to relive this experience. However, my therapist seems to think that talking about it, and maybe getting some input from other people will help me. What I experienced last weekend will forever haunt me to my core, and I guess I just have to live with that. So, here we go. 



My name is Sam, and I am 23 years old. Before this incident I would explore abandoned buildings with a friend of mine, Hailey, she was around my age. She never liked the creepiness of the places we visited, but I could always convince her to tag along. I like to think that it was because I was a bigger guy, so maybe she felt safe around me? I don't know. After what happened, I almost wish I had just never met her. 



So, because I'm only doing this once, I feel that maybe I should give you as much detail as I can because well… I really don't want to talk about this anymore than I have to. When Hailey and I would go exploring I would wear (from bottom to top) black boots that I would tuck camo pants into, a thermal long sleeve shirt, a thick hoodie, and a beanie. I wore a backpack as well that I would carry random things in, first aid, rope, flashlights, ect. Hailey would wear running shoes, leggings, and a thermal long sleeve shirt that she would roll the sleeves up on. The cold never messed with Hailey, almost as if it was scared of her. She was very agile and did most of the climbing on our adventures. 



Now for the *actual* story. One night, colder than most, we had a plan to explore an old abandoned motel at the outskirts of town. The walk there was like any other, Hailey and I talked about what’s been happening in our lives since the last time we had seen each other. 



It took us about an hour to reach the motel.

	

The motel was two stories, the office was on the left hand side and had stairs outside of it that would travel to the second floor. All of the rooms on the second floor were directly above the ones on the first floor, perfectly symmetrical. The floor on the outside of the rooms was a deep wooden brown, while the railings on the second floor were a pale white. A No-Vacancy sign lit the parking lot, flickering on and off, with a massive arrow creating most of the light. 

  


“You ready?” I asked Hailey. 



“Let’s just get this over with,” she said. “I really don’t like motels.”

  


Hailey and I went to opposite sides of the motel trying to open every door we could. Not a single one opened. We never wanted to break anything like windows, or kick down doors, it made too much noise, that's why we walked. There was this smell, I couldn't quite identify it at the time but it was a horrible smell I had never been around before. Something wretched, and vile, something that made every cell in my body want to run. However, against my better judgment, we pressed on. 



Eventually we found a door. It was normal-ish looking. Every other door was either broken or rotted. All of them were white and had aluminum knockers. The door before us was clearly well kept, pristine white with a shiny brass colored knocker, but the smell was horrid. We had finally gotten close enough to it to realize what it was. It was death. The awful smell of mold, spoiled meat, rotten wood, iron, and god knows what else assaulted my nostrils so hard it made me want to pass out. To this day I can not tell you why we entered that room. We should’ve ran, ran and never looked back, but we didn't, or rather I didn’t. 



I was the one to enter the room, Hailey already hated being there, and I’m pretty sure she had already made up her mind to never join me again. She stayed at the door to let me know if any cars were to pull into the parking lot. When I looked back to confirm that that’s what she was doing I could see her shaking. 



The door closed behind me, it made me jump. The inside of the motel room was damn near perfect. It may have been dark, but I could clearly see that the bed was perfectly made, the carpet was spotless, and even the dresser and the T.V. looked perfect, not a speck of dust or anything. That smell though, just… lingered. To this day, I wish, hell I would even beg whatever god or deity or entity that exists, that I didn’t open the bathroom door. 



Red used to be my favorite color. Now it’s not. As soon as I opened the door, I nearly passed out. I finally found where that horrid, hair raising smell had been coming from. The entire space of the bathroom was covered in blood, it looked like it had been finger painted onto the wall. The crimson fluid cascading down the walls that had the dull, faded hue of old parchment gave me shivers. I followed the streams of blood to the bathtub, where I saw a  bloated hunk of flesh bobbing in the murky water, its surface slick and swollen, glistening like something half-rotted yet disturbingly alive as it twitched with wet, nauseating squelches. I was frozen. It was almost as if time had stopped. The only thing that broke me out of my cold gaze was a wet, gurgly groan that emanated from the tub. Finally coming to my senses, I ran out of the bathroom. Being disoriented didn’t help. I ran faster than I ever had before. When I got to the door, it was locked, or at least it wouldn’t open. I begged and screamed for Hailey to open the door. I turned to look at the bathroom and saw this amalgamation of flesh, hair, eyes, and hands, crawling its way to me slowly but surely. I felt terror, for the first time in my life, I knew that I would die.

  


*This is it*, I thought to myself. *I’m gonna fucking die in a motel room*. 

  


Hailey must have found a metal pipe or something because, almost like an angel, she caved a hole in the door and dragged me out. We pushed an old dresser, maybe from one of the other rooms, in front of the broken door. I never told Hailey what I saw. In fact, we didn't talk at all on the walk back. The only thing you could hear was our respective footwear tapping the rock and asphalt beneath us, and the occasional cricket or coyote. I dropped her off at home, and if I'm being honest, I don't even remember my walk home. 



I don’t sleep anymore, I barely close my eyes and I see that… *thing*.



I mainly just drink now. 



Hailey and I don't talk anymore. 



I need to go to the store, Goodnight.
