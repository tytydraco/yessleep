No one was surprised when Eddies, a small, greasy burger joint that had only opened a year prior in my town, was said to be closing down permanently within a couple of days.

In the weeks leading up to the announcement, a multitude of allegations were sent flying in the direction of its owner, Eddie. Ranging from claims of embezzling, to accusations of unfaithfulness which left him divorced, it was only a matter of time before Eddie pulled the plug.

I thought it a shame, though. Despite my less than favourable opinion of the guy, the burgers in which he served were the best in town. So, for old times’ sake, I decided to pay the joint one last visit before its passing.

The door-chime rang a familiar ding as I entered into the barren burger place. I could hear the hissing of grills from far in the back as I approached the counter. I stood there in uncomfortable silence for a few seconds, before I heard a familiar, hoarse voice call to me from out of view.

“Who’s there?” Eddie croaked out in a low-pitched tone, his voice sounding strained and choked as if he had just been sobbing.

“Um, a customer? Sorry, is it not open today?” I asked, fully prepared to turn myself around and walk back out, before Eddie shuffled into view.

He had seen better days. Eyebags sagged his face down and an unkempt stubble was sprinkled across his jawline. He wore a stained apron, with a sweaty wife-beater underneath. It was clear he had been crying, as his eyes were red and he was shovelling dribbling mucus off his face with a gloved hand.

He cleared his throat before speaking. “Yeah, yeah. It’s uh… it’s open. What can I get you?”

I was hesitant in responding. In my mind, I was contemplating whether to just call it a day and apologise for bothering him, or to let my gluttony get the best of me. I soon made up my mind.

“Yeah, can I get a chicken fillet burger and a side of crinkled fries? Oh, and a drink. Pepsi, please.”

Eddie didn’t appear to fully register my order at first, as it seemed he was zoning out while staring off into the distance. From the kitchen, I began to hear faint shuffling and a muffled voice intertwined with the hissing of what I presumed was the cooker. Eddie seemed to take notice and thus responded abruptly.

“OKAY! Got it. Just take a seat and I’ll be right there with your order. And don’t mind the noises, those are just the moving guys.” He told me with a shaky tone, his eyes locked on me while he cracked a nervous smile.

At the time, I decided to give the guy a pass for his odd behaviour. I mean, his entire life was basically over, who can blame him for being slightly unstable.

Eddie returned to the kitchen as I found a seat and began to scroll mindlessly on my phone for the next five minutes. Throughout those five minutes, I could hear Eddie in the back whispering and slamming objects. I assumed he was assisting the moving guys and tuned it out.

That’s when my nose picked up on a smell.

Rotten and sulfureous, it attacked my nostrils and made my eyes water from how bad it smelt. I thought it was the scent of rotten meat or out-of-date vegetables that had drifted its way from the back, but I soon found that the smell was doing more than just revolting me.

It was making my head dizzy and my vision steadily blurry. At that point, I just couldn’t champion through it any longer, as whatever was in the air was choking my lungs and making my throat begin to burn. I pushed my chair back and began stumbling my way to the door, when I heard Eddie begin shouting.

“HERE IT FUCKING COMES, BITCH, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!” He shouted, his voice undeniably distraught and haggard. I was far too desperate for air to acknowledge his words in that moment, as I sprung the door open and exited onto the sidewalk into the cold December air.

It didn’t remain cold, however, as a wave of heat from behind blasted me off my feet and into the street. My head collided with the icy tarmac as everything suddenly went black. My memory from that point remains hazy, but from what I can remember, red and orange bled into the darkness as I slowly came to, flat on my back surrounded by passer-byers, ears ringing.

I could see Eddies was no more, as a violent inferno laid claim to the establishment, windows shattered as its foundation shook. The front room was in complete ruin, flames bellowing from where I once sat, before I again fell unconscious.

Upon waking in the hospital and being questioned by the police, I learned what had happened. A murder-suicide. Eddie had bought canisters of Hydrogen Sulfide and was in the process of filling the building with it, when I just happened to enter.

The hissing I heard was not that of the cooker or fryer, hell there wasn’t even any cooking appliances in the kitchen as, unknowingly to me, it had been stripped clean a day prior. Instead, what I heard was the sound of gas leaking.

Thankfully, by the time Eddie had begun to flick alive a lighter, I had already taken one step out of the door, foiling his attempt at taking me with him by a hair, as he ignited the flammable gas.

But it remains a murder-suicide, as despite my survival, me and Eddie weren’t the only ones there at the time. A woman was there too, Eddies mistress as I found out. She had been invited over and had been restrained and gagged by him by the time I entered. The muffled noises I had heard had been hers as she struggled to escape from her bindings, to which she could not, and thus she perished alongside Eddie.

It’s been a year since then, and as funny as it may sound, I do now hold a slight irrational fear of fast-food restaurants. It’s just… I was only a second away from being immolated, and I didn’t even know it.

So now, whenever I’m in any fast-food joint, I always make sure that the hissing I hear from the kitchen are that of grills and fryers.

And not the final act of a man on the end of his line.
