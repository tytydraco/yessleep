Here's a little story that keeps me awake.



I  knew that  my uncle's death was caused by a heart attack till this day when my mom told me the real story that turned out to be rlly darker than i thought.





15 yrs ago,
our family lived together with my uncle and my aunt in a villa(at floor 1 were the bedrooms) .My uncle  worked on a bar where were slot machines.




One night there was a customer that got angry for losing his money at games and my uncle started mocking him till the point when he threaten him that he will kill him if he doesn't stop and ofc my uncle just continued.Later that night,I was waken by the yells of my aunt.



My parents would go there to see what happened,and when they returned,they just said my uncle died and to not leave the room.What happened was,that man broke into our house and cut my uncle's throat,right on the next room where i was sleeping.




Now I wonder what would have happened if moments before the killing i would have needed to pee and I would have met in the hallway the killer.Would I still be alive?
