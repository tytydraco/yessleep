As a child, you invent scary stories. That shape in the basement isn’t just old furniture - it’s a monster. The creak in the hallway isn’t the shifting planks of an old house, it’s a killer creeping towards you. There is something deeply wrong with *that* house on the block.

There’s always that one creepy house - you don’t know if anyone lives there or not. Usually decrepit, but not always. For me, the house everyone whispered about was pristine. The grass was cut short and clean. The leaves got swept. But we never saw hide nor hair of anyone living there. I’d asked my parents once who lived there. My parents couldn’t agree - my dad thought it was a reclusive family of three, and my mom thought it was an old retiree.

Of course, it takes more than that for a house to stand out. What disturbed me, and all the other kids on Bus #3 in Thornton Middle School, was how the door was always left hanging, banging in the wind as if declaring, “I’m open! I’m open! Come in!” I had the dubious pleasure of having moved next door to the Welcoming House, as we called it, that summer. This may have been why our bus stopped right in front of the house. The house’s lights were always off, except for when the bus pulled in. Windows would light up one by one, a warm orange, inviting color, though curtains blocked us from seeing inside. The lights would stay on until the last kid scurried away out of sight, and then they would wink shut room by room, faster than you could run and slam the light switches. I know this because my friend Bowie and I had timed it. 1.5 seconds from one end of the house to another.

Bowie was more curious about it than me. He’s the one who wanted to time the lights, and when he realized I lived next door to the house, he insisted on a sleepover to try and investigate. I refused at first - it wasn’t that I didn’t want him to sleep over, but it was going to be my room spying on the house - if someone inside saw us looking in, it would be my ass on the line. It only took him until October to convince me - the season had me itching to try something scary, and we had lived next to the house for a few months without anything new happening. He brought his telescope, convincing my parents that we would go stargazing. That was how we ended up kicked out in the backyard - after all, the best place to use your telescope was outside. That was the first thing that went wrong with Bowie’s plan. We no longer had the walls of my house to hide us.

Bowie still insisted on continuing, even though I pleaded for him to stop. He aimed the telescope at one of the windows of the Welcoming House, towards the back.

“I think I see someone!” he whispered. “But I can’t make anything out! I -”

Bowie yelped as the light came on in the room he’d been staring at. Unlike the windows in the front, this window didn’t have any curtains. The light revealed what might have been a kitchen, but any appliances had long been removed. There were only white walls, with no hint of the person Bowie had claimed to see. The lights in the remaining rooms turned on at once, as though the house was turning its burning gaze at us. Not a single person in sight, just blank walls. Bowie and I ran inside screaming, leaving the telescope in the backyard.

We spent the remainder of the night huddled under blankets, refusing to be anywhere close to a window. Instead of watching horror movies like we’d planned, we half-watched a superhero movie as we wondered what, if anything, was going to happen. I snuck a look before we went to bed for the night, and saw that one room in the neighboring house still had its lights on. It was the same one Bowie had been looking into. It took a long time to fall asleep that night.

When we got up the next morning to retrieve Bowie’s telescope, it was gone, and all the lights in the house next door were off. When Bowie’s parents came to pick him up, they were furious at him. As I waved goodbye to him through the window, I saw Bowie’s face distort in fear, when I heard a \*click\* and the light was turned on. I swung my head around, but no one was there - my parents were still in the backyard, looking behind bushes for the lost telescope. I ran outside to join them, so I wouldn’t be alone with what I thought might now be inside my house.

At school the next day, Bowie told me what he saw. A person, he thought, or at least something that looked like one, staring over my shoulder at him. The same thing he’d seen in the Welcoming House through the telescope. I resolved to tell my parents that night. On the bus ride home, we all saw that the lights on the Welcoming House didn’t turn on. Around us, other kids whispered theories about why the house had changed, while Bowie and I solemnly looked into my bedroom window. There, the light had just come on.

I told my parents everything. My mother scolded me for spying on other people as my father searched the house from corner to corner with a baseball bat. He found no one. Still, I spent the next week sleeping in my parent’s room. It may have been in my head, but I swear the house creaked far more than it had the past few months, as if someone was walking around the house on and off all night.

When my parents had enough and finally kicked me back out into my own room, I was terrified. I tried to sleep with the lights on, although every now and then I would have to scan my room and make sure I was alone. It was at one of these times that I saw something in my closet. The door was ever so slightly ajar, and something like an eye was reflecting light back at me. I screamed for my parents, and they came charging in. When I explained something was in the closet, they checked dubiously. To their annoyance and my horror, they found Bowie’s telescope, aimed directly at my bed. I’d seen the light reflecting off the lens.

At school, I made a plan. Halloween was only in three days. For those next few nights, I refused to sleep by myself no matter what, even if I had to scream and throw a tantrum. The sounds at night grew worse and worse. Lights started turning on by themselves, just like at the house next door. My parents blamed the house’s age and faulty wiring, but I knew better. On the night of Halloween, my family left to go trick-or-treating with Bowie and his parents. As we left, I made sure the door was ever so slightly ajar. As we walked away from our house, I couldn’t help but look up at my room, where the light had again turned on. This time, I did see someone, though the figure disappeared before I could make out any details. I tried to put that sight out of my mind - it didn’t matter what it was. It would be gone tonight, I hoped.

The rest of the night was spent stocking up on candy and trying not to think about the thing that had entered our home. My mom only let me eat candy after she inspected it. She’d heard the stories about people hiding razors or drugs in candy, and it struck me as hilarious that she was more concerned about that than what had been haunting us.

After a full night of trick-or-treating, Bowie’s family and mine parted ways to go back home. When we arrived, we saw the door was wide open, with small muddy shoeprints on the carpeting inside. My dad cursed, while I hid a smile. The person had only taken a few steps inside before leaving the house, maybe checking for candy - I just hoped it had been enough for the thing to latch onto them. When my parents told me to sleep in my own room that night, I gave in. After two weeks of sleepless nights, I slept like a baby. The nights were quiet now. There wasn’t the sound of something walking through the halls. Lights stayed off. I had succeeded.

A few weeks later, I heard that a kid in Thornton Elementary and his family had disappeared into thin air. No one was very concerned - one person disappearing was cause for concern, but a family disappearing must have meant that they had moved away in a rush. Only I knew better, because on the bus ride home, I saw my bedroom light turn on.
