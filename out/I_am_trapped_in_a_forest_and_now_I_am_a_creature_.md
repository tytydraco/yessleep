I am trapped in a forest. This whole problem happened when me and my friends thought it would be fun if we explore the woods that so many of our folk has told us to not go to.

We should've listened, now it's just me. All alone, fighting against these creatures for my life. These creatures aren't anything like a animal yet they act like them. The others got killed by them, mainly the Watchers or Guardians Of The Forest as my folk would call them. Humaniod creatures with wood-like skin that's bulletproof, with a thousand holes instead of eyes that seem to have red light come from the holes, a large crooked mouth that seems to be carved on it yet able to function like a mouth

When I saw the forest, I knew why so many of my folk warned me. There was vines around men's necks over campfires that are more like roots that have parts that can generate heat and light in where the fire would be.

Now I thought I saw someone in a cave but it must have been my imagination

One creature that we encountered are the Climbers, who actually are friendly until you corner one, they seem to have a large hand in their mouth and also are made of vines and flesh. We found out what it is when one of my friends, Victor who lives in VÃ­ctor, Arequipa, Peru, got close to it and got choked to death and eaten.

Now you may be wondering why I can't leave and still is able to type this is because, first off, the Watchers won't let me leave at all, and second of all, I somehow built a cellphone tower. But I have to make daily repairs on it because the Watchers keep breaking it.

Sometimes I look into the forest to see one of the trees open their eyes and mouth and then charge at me, but it's easy once you know how to get out of the way.

And the most of the time, I hear voices trying to lure me out of a safe spot.

Now there are times when others, mostly kids, get here but they get killed too fast for me warn them of danger.

And I think I am starting to become one of the creatures, due to my skin peeling away and moss-like skin mixes with my flesh, as vines start to develop. But I usually patch it up.

Is that the exit? Am I finally free to go out? That's when to my horror, I saw myself and my friends enter the forest, I had become one of the creatures. I am a part of the forest. Now I am hungry for human flesh specifically Denis's flesh, who was killed by what I have became. And the hunger got worse over time...... sorry Denis it had to be done, I was starving beyond what I thought I was. Leaving this here so maybe one version of me can read it, but I doubt it. Perhaps something can change that would reveal the exit while still human?
