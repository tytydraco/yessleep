I'll try to be coherent but I'm genuinely panicking.


I have a bachelor's in molecular biology. I used to be pre-med but I think even my parents have given up on that ever happening. I was working as a medical assistant for my gap years before realizing I should consider research as a career. I figured I should work in a lab before deciding if I wanted to pursue a PhD in biology.


I applied to a bunch of biology, neuroscience, and clinical research positions, all entry-level positions. I finally got into a lab at my local medical school, my dream school. 


I've since worked there for a year. After a few months, they brought me in to help the lab next door that studies virus-host interactions on the molecular level. In this new lab, the post-doc runs the show. A few pre-med college students and I do the grunt work, mostly preparing petri dish stuff or helping the grad students with their stuff. A few med students pop in semi-regularly, but they mostly just email the grad students and write up papers. After a while, I started spending more time in the new lab than in the first lab I was hired for. Fortunately, the new lab pays a dollar more per hour.


Starting at the virus lab was both cool and scary because of the hazmat type of protective gear we had to wear for some of the work. They said this level of protection was new for a project they started a year before I joined. I liked bragging to my friends about feeling like a movie scientist. However, getting in and out of the virus zones a few times a week never stopped feeling tedious.


Two months ago, I talked to the PI (principal investigator) about applying to PhD programs in Biology. I started working on my application and writing up letters of recommendation from him and the post-doc for myself. (I think writing your own rec letters is pretty common nowadays.) After my talk with the PI, our post-doc agreed to let me be more involved in the research.


Two days ago, the post-doc emailed me a draft paper of our current research. I got around to reading it last night in my apartment. I've already read a few of the published articles and sat in meetings about our current projects. But reading the introduction about the life-cycle of the virus we're using in our main project terrified me more than the dozens of safety warning signs in the lab.  I suddenly remembered a mistake I made three weeks ago. I hadn't removed my protective gear properly and accidentally touched my gloves before disposing them.


A week after that, I had hung out at a fellow research assistant's house, celebrating his acceptance to med school. I had met his family and hugged his grandma. The next morning, I had a sore throat. I assumed I caught it from his siblings. Within a day, I was bed-ridden. I had a high-grade fever, muscle aches, send a painfully dry cough. I let the post-doc know that I caught a cold from my friend's siblings. It took a week for me to get better, and even then, I stayed home and did tasks that I could do remotely for a few more days. Once I got better, I visited my family for the holidays and hung out in downtown with some friends.


A week later (a few days ago), my friend took leave to attend his grandma's funeral. He told me privately that she had caught the cold from his siblings and went to ER before passing away. His brother went back to school in LA after the funeral.


Reading the draft paper last night, I connected all the dots. I immediately called the post-doc and told him my symptoms matched our virus and that I had been exposed to it 3 weeks ago. He freaked out and told me to call 911 before hanging up to call the PI.


I called 911 and told them that I was exposed to a virus in my lab, that I already spread it in downtown and to my family and friends, and that it may have already killed one person. They told me to stay quarantined.


I've been checking the news but nothing has come out yet. My PI texted me to stay quarantined and that he would talk with me in detail later. There's police outside my apartment complex but they haven't come to my door or called my phone.


So if you live in Dallas or Los Angeles, stay home. I'm sorry.
