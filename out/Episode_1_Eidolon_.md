Somewhere on this plane of existence at a desolate car storage and salvage yard, the fate of thousands of lives are on the crux of finding their place in the eternal grand design.
 
" Ok, Mr. Clancy after a bit of digging through our paper archives we've found the proper information that will allow us to release your fathers car to you. Once again sorry for the wait,

"I've got all the time in the world" clancy said, "ahh the retired life must be one amazing maze of doing whatever you feel passionate about for the rest of your days. I'll be honest,after we got bought out some years ago the faceless corporate overlords changed a lot of lot numbers and the storage ordering has been harder to understand than why a chicken would want to cross a road." as a weak chuckle escaped from the clerk.

Mr. Clancy remained unamused and silent waiting for them to take him to the storage unit."So anyway the old unit may have gotten roughed up in shuffle & may be slightly banged up, but if you're ok with a few dings that'll probably be easy to fix then we just need you to sign a few waivers and forms and we'll have you set up with a tow truck to get this aging beauty to wherever you need it."

 Clancy remained silent as he signed the paperwork, as they left the office to see a crane already moving the shipping container being moved towards their location." Damn shame to be honest it's been sitting here for over a decade and the weather hasn't been kind to her as the rusty & dusty container was lowered into the yard. Clancy told them to drop it as the clerk signaled the crane operator to disengage, the container smashed into the ground dispersing a dense cloud of dust, 

Sinclair walked into the container and threw out the passenger door then an oversized duffel bag that hit the ground and almost put a dent in the dirt he hopped out and grabbed the bag walked to the clerk "there's another bag in the driver's seat & you look like a fair and reasonable man that's tired of working for a living do whatever you want with it as clancy looked to the Sun and began to walk. "He's not coming back for it is he?" The crane operator yelled down as clancy departed into The horizon as the slim black figure began to blend into the heat mirage until he became an indistinguishable elusive Phantasm waltzing in the daylight. 

"What the hell was in that bag" the clerk whispered to himself. "Hey Jim what the hell was that about?" "Dear Horatio there are things in heaven and Earth not meant to be understood by the minds of mortal men" "who the hell is Horatio and what are we going to do with this pile of scrap" "move it to the heap and tag it that'll give Marcus something to do tomorrow instead of annoying the hell out of me. 

"Got a few more hours until we can get out of here" the crane operator yelled out "for you maybe but I've still got some paperwork to mock up" "cameras were rolling today right boss? Something about that stranger don't sit right with me. "Forget about it Fred I'm pretty sure he'd say the same about you if y'all had a conversation". 

As night fell Jim was enamored by his thoughts and schemes contemplating what kind of wealth was to be amassed with an ominous fortune to be seized. Jim waited outside the cameras view ready to strike like a ghost in the night "2 minutes until they reset ha I used to complain to the old man and the new cronies that it's time to upgrade and stop wiping the tapes, hmph maybe they had some skeletons in the closet". With a flashlight in hand, he made his way to the wreckage.

 "Lot 9 section 2" he repeated as the unusual stacks of rubbish bent and creaked under pressure and the pressure was definitely on. "Finally here"  sweat had began to saturate his shirt and bead down his face, he kicked the container to rattle any rodents that may have found their way in there at that instance he began to rummage inside the wreckage, he noticed something glowing in the car it was faint and alluring, which should have been an auspicious warning to beware be wary and be aware. The light faded as he was temporarily distracted by a noise and was replaced by a pulsating vibration that had gone unnoticed due to Jim's heart beating 5 miles a minute.

 He took his knife and started cutting into the seat to reveal a blue duffel bag that felt like it weighed 100 pounds, believing in the addage of working smarter not harder jim went to the supply hut to get a dolly after he had lugged the bag out of the container. Upon opening the hut door he almost shit his pants in the dark store room there was a human shaped silhouette, as he yelled and kicked at the shadows then aimed his flashlight into the darkness to have his fear alleviated for the moment "I'm losing it, I that thought it was that guy from earlier" 

(ignoring the unimportant transit) Jim had arrived at his apartment and double locked his doors and windows. His eyes were to be the only ones to witness the splendor of his bounty. As he threw the bag on his coffee table it was pulverized and splintered under the weight of the bag, which should have been expected from a rational mind but greed had taken hold of him as he ripped the bag open to have his fantasies fulfilled. 

His eyes were affixed to the largest amount of money he had ever seen, yet the crown jewel would have been a small blood red gem that was oddly wet and unrealistically heavy. His face almost ripped by how hard he was smiling due to the prosperity at hand. As jim planned out the rest of his life of luxury an odd rapping at the door occurred, which subsequently made him hurl the pile of money he had in his hands into the ceiling fan. 

Being an anti-social person compounded by the paranoia of a duffle bag bursting with money made him overly cautious, as he crept to his room to retrieve his shotgun the knocking turned into pounding & door knob rattling. Jim silently and cautiously went to the peephole to see who was causing calamity outside, all to have goosebumps replace his epidermis.

"Tha... That's that strange fellows hat" believing that coincidences are just meticulously laid plans, laden with deception and misdirection. It was lazily placed directly in the middle of the hallway.That more than enough to propel Jim's adrenaline and fear into overdrive as terror took hold of his nervous system, solely focused on surviving another second his more keen primal senses had betrayed Jim.

 Making him deaf to the sounds of every window and door in his apartment unlocking he was still affixed on the hat, utterly frozen in fear the lights in the hallway started to flicker, followed by a door in the hallway being blown off it's hinges, then another followed it up as it continued up the hallway leading to Jim's room. Adding to the pure blood chilling pandemonium that he had recently been subject to, the sight of hands riddled with maggots and decayed flesh began clawing their way out of the dark rooms the undead have escaped from hell as revenants they began making their way towards him. Even with their hollow eye sockets he could feel their cold stares tear his soul asunder.

As Jim backed up slowly, to distance himself from the skeletal denizens, he was halted by something that should not have been there, Jim had almost broken the wooden butt of his shotgun by clenching it so hard. He jerked around and shot blindly as he missed the target and reduced the pile cash into a green mist all to be met by the visage of an uncloaked reaper with one blood red gem in its eye socket. As it's unnatural maw began to open the pungent oder of decay and sulfur made Jim's innards erupt. The skeletal figure screeched and the sight of shredded vocal cords reverberated violently and shook the room. was more than noticeable.

As Jim stood paralyzed utterly oblivious to the fact that he had been hoisted up by the entity as it's mouth opened instead of seeing through it, he saw visions, the old town hotel, legions of foul demonic creatures in an arena, and his own body being hoisted by death itself, his body had gone cold the extreme heat of the entity began to scorch the area, a scaley claw came from it's mouth and gripped Jim's face and as his his skull began to creak and crack Jim spat at the beast "there's one shot left you ugly fucking beast." Boom!
