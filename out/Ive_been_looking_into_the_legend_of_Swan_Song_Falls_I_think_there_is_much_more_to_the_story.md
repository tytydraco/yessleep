My name is Tanner Felton. I come from a logging community on the outskirts of Alberta called Rowley. It’s Small. Forgotten. The only things that seem to grow here are the trees, the cemetery plots, and the foreclosure signs. 

  
Those with any sense in them at all, any ounce of potential, take the main drag out of town and don’t ever look back. Rumbling down the dusty gravel road that carves into main street, past the potholes and ditches and chicken wire and all those rickety shops boarded up and vacant. 

  
I guess that’s why I’m still here. 

  
But there is a story that originates from here. A local legend that I’ve grown to covet. Hell, some might call it a downright obsession. But it’s the only thing worth talking about around here. And if it keeps the memory of my brother alive, then I’m going to tell it. 

  
The *right* way.  

  
So here it goes:

  
There were twelve boys and two scout leaders. Back in the early 1970’s, well before the adoption of the internet, cell phones, and modern GPS technology. They ventured out into crown land east of Banff National Park for a weekend getaway. It was meant to be a light-hearted bit of adventure. The boys were in search of their “Earth” badge, designed to help foster a love of nature in the youth and teach them to be better stewards of our planet. Simple activities were required to pass the test and earn your rank–tasks like planting trees, starting campfires, and studying the local fauna. Everything was to be jotted down and recorded in their journals. The scout leaders were there to lend a helping hand when necessary and oversee the boys' training. They were all well-versed in wilderness training, skilled backcountry hikers with supplies to survive the elements, and enough food to last weeks. 

  
But in hindsight, this was their biggest problem. Their faith in their abilities. This fallacy that you can never be too prepared, when in reality, you are *never* prepared for what’s out there. 

  
There are over 100 million acres of crown land in Alberta–vast, and much of it raw, unserviced wilderness. It was quite the camping introduction for a group of children, but not uncommon or entirely unsafe for hiking enthusiasts to undertake. 

  
As far as sources could tell their journey started on the fringe of a well-known hiking trail called “The Valley of the Knives”. The trail is a relatively flat, low-incline trek to a breathtaking clearing carved out by a receding glacier hundreds of years ago. What gave the five-kilometer trail its name was a forest fire that ravaged the area long ago that had left the tree line along the perimeter charred, the sharp branches of the dead trees jagged and protruding. They sat pointed and overhanging the steep drop into the valley. The underbrush never seemed to replace the scorched death.

  
It started there, but it didn't end there.

  
Park ranger's best estimates were that they kept to the trail for a kilometer or two before they veered off into the uncharted woods. The reason for the split? Nobody knows. Part of the group headed northwest toward an outcrop of mountains called the Misty Range. They traveled approximately twenty kilometers into the suffocating woods, battling treacherous inclines; it would have been an incredibly taxing feat for the young boys, who ranged in age from eight to ten years old. Some might even call it reckless. 

  
Twenty kilometres and then the trail runs cold.

  
Any average hiker familiar with the area would have known they were never going to make it. 

  
The other group headed east into the vast nothingness of trees before appearing to have looped south in the direction of the freeway (whether it was on purpose or just sheer luck was up to debate).   
What was clear was that both group's tracks seemingly stopped deep within the Alberta wilderness, for very different reasons.

  
A two-night trip turned into forever. 

  
I’ve tried my best to give the full side of the story, as best I know it. I’ve pieced together what is accessible today through online archives and libraries. It’s a long way back to search, so, the records aren’t the greatest, but much of the reporting is public knowledge, at least to locals in the area.

Evidence recovered: Rope, can of bear spray, pieces of nylon, damaged journal.

  
What is known is that the group headed northwest in a zigzag pattern from the Valley of the Knives trail. There were two attempts at establishing a base camp. The first was a small space on a mild slope, approximately twelve kilometers from the estimated point of exit from the trail. The area had been cleared rather crudely with what must have been a small hatchet, although nothing was ever recovered by park authorities. Lots of signs of activity were present: plenty of footprints (both wildlife and human), a gathering of stones, flowers, and kindling.   

  
The second camp was likely where they had decided to stay. It was near the edge of a cliff, about an eight-hundred-meter incline that was tricky to traverse. It required a switchback route to tackle the steep ascent. Once atop the mini-mountain, the landscape leveled. Large jagged outcrops of rocks provided shelter from the wind. A scorched patch of earth indicated there had been a fire, with experts confirming that it had been left burning likely through the night. 

  
But there were clear indications of distress. Scattered trails of footprints, deep and spread out, were found in strange twisting directions. Broken branches were scattered everywhere. Markings on trees, both shallow and gaping, indicated both human and animal activity. Fluorescent green shreds of nylon littered the soil. Rope still swung from the top of an evergreen tree, tied in a clove hitch knot. A journal was recovered but the pages were so weathered that it was impossible to decipher. 

  
And maybe the most alarming piece of evidence of them all–the can of unopened bear spray–was found at the bottom of the cliff. 

  
 But there were no bodies. And no blood. 

  
The police brought in tracking experts and experienced hunters familiar with the area, but no one could decipher what exactly happened in the chaos. 

  
**Group #2: The Forest Loop:**   

Sources: The Kananaskis Country Weekly, The Calgary Herald, The Edmonton Sun.

Evidence recovered: Pieces of the Valley of the Knives trail map, 

  
Sixty kilometers east. That’s likely how far the group had traveled before whatever happened to them, happened. A nearly staggering number of steps to think about–nearly impossible–given the amount of daylight they would have had that first day and the general fitness levels and experience of the children. 

  
No signs of stopping. A steady slog through the dense sea of trees. 

  
No sign of a camp. Just an eerily straight line darting from the trail for a long, long time.

  
The park rangers combed through the area, following the dirt, crunched leaves, and depressed earth. The only items recovered were pieces of the map. The tiny torn pieces of paper were found consistently along the path of footprints. A trail of breadcrumbs to follow. 

  
At the sixty-kilometre mark, a decision must have been made to turn south. For another couple of kilometers, the trail heads back toward the direction of the car, but with so much distance to cover, they likely needed a full day's worth of hiking to return to the vehicle. After the two-kilometre mark, the trail disappears. 

  
Two mysteries. One common denominator—the claims of a serene sound of water cascading against the rocks just off into the distance and the eventual sighting of a majestic waterfall.

  
One of the scout leaders survived. They found him in rough shape–hallucinating, emaciated— but otherwise intact. That same year he put a bullet in his brain. Most suspected that this tragedy had been him and his partner's doing, after all, who would force children to hike those kinds of distances in the middle of nowhere? But his lips were sealed tighter than the jail cell doors he was destined to be locked behind.

  
 A lot of the truth died with him. 

  
The only other survivor was my brother, Tony. A trucker found him huddled at the edge of the forest, drenched and clutching what remained of his journal–shredded and water-logged beyond recognition.  
He was never the same.

  
I wished he would have told us something. I know a part of him died in that forest, lost and swallowed up in the darkness for all that time. Hearing those animal howls all night long, surviving whatever the hell happened on that hike. I can only imagine what he went through.

  
After what happened, he never really finished school. Teachers said he found it hard to stay focused. He worked odd labour jobs over at the coal mines and the mill. Nothing seemed to stick for very long, and then, eventually, nothing stuck at all.

  
Some nights, in his sleep, his teeth would randomly chatter. In his dreams, he would make these strange high-pitched sounds; sometimes his breathing was erratic like he was on the verge of drowning. 

  
During the day, his eyes would often wander to the blank spaces of the walls where no amount of yelling or shaking him could break him out of his stupor. 

  
Decades went by with no answers. More mysteries and more missing people began to pile up, and Tony slowly began to abandon himself. He let his hair run long and straggly. His once wiry physique was trapped inside a pudgy, bulbous layer of fat. He had lost all ambition for anything. 

  
I cared for Tony after our mother and father had passed. I wish I could say there was a lot of time spent connecting. I was all he had, after all. The truth of it was, I didn’t know how to talk to him anymore. We spent a lot of nights on opposite sofas watching TV. The rest of the time he was in his room. I urged him to seek help, but he vehemently denied any.

  
Then last year he took off. Out of the blue, no warning. The only things missing were his car and our father’s ancient backpacking equipment. 

  
When I found out, I alerted the authorities. Search parties were sent to the area. 

  
What they found was not Tony. It was the remains of a young girl. Naked, mutilated, slashed in fifty different directions with gouges so deep the skin flaps dangled helplessly from the bone. She was fifteen, and from what the police had uncovered, fingerprints captured from one of his DUI’s matched the crime scene. They had linked Tony with the murder. 

  
I've seen the photos and I know my brother Tony was helpless around blood. He’d quiver at the sight of a paper cut. He was never a violent man, even in the worst throes of his trauma.

  
Those markings were not the makings of a man. They were the markings of some kind of… monster. 

  
I’ve been on the hunt for the falls ever since. Two times I’ve been out there looking for him, hiking the Valley of the Knives. At my age, those were two death sentences I somehow managed to survive. But I’ve never made it to the falls.

  
That last expedition I know I got close. I heard the voices beyond the branches, somewhere distant, deep in the woodland. 

  
And when I came home, everything was different.

  
I think I hear what he was hearing. It brings a shiver down my spine. The humming stream of water. The gentle whistling–light, seductive, almost floating.

  
It’s calling me back toward it. And I know he’s still out there, my brother Tony. 

  
I won’t let it swallow him up again. 

  
My name is Tanner Felton. Please remember— in case anything ever happens to me, in case they question my judgment or sound mind. 

  
Remember the legend, as it should be told. 

  
The next time I’m going out there it will be for good. I don’t know when, but I’ve got a plan to map out the area that leads to the falls. 

  
And this time, I’m not leaving without him.
