I should have listened.

I got home from my shift this morning and everything seemed normal. Then I went upstairs to grab my phone charger. Scrawled around the room, dozens of times, was a new phrase: PROTECT YOUR BLOOD.

“The poltergeist lost it, dude,” said Harris. “It’s gonna turn on him.”

“Dude, it’s like Mr. Jones!” said Isaac excitedly.

“Who’s Mr. Jones?”

“You don’t remember? The guy who runs the blood disease hospital? From *The Urinals* episode?”

“That was *The Urinals* episode? I thought that was *The Up Down Game*.”

“No, that was the giant demon baby with a bobble head.”

“Oh, yeah, Mr. Jones!” Harris went on a tirade in a western accent saying how Mr. Jones was going to steal my blood, which left Isaac in a fit of laughter. I was so tired from the change of schedule I didn’t even feel like paying attention. I sat down on the couch and almost immediately passed out.

I woke up and couldn’t move. It seemed like the light breaking through the curtains with its acid yellow glow wasn’t bright enough for midday. Something was standing in the corner of the room.

My eyes flicked as far as they could to the corner, but I didn’t have to wait long to see what emerged. I had heard about sleep paralysis and what went with it, but finally having it happen to me filled me with a terror I have never felt before. With slow methodical steps, a woman in a tattered black dress walked from the corner to stand over me. The yellow hue of the room made her pale skin a toxic amber. Ratted black hair tumbled down her shoulder, and her unblinking gaze fell upon me such that my body went from fire to ice and back again. Her black lips parted to show a terrible smile full of sinister intent. When she looked in my eyes, I thought I might have a heart attack.

A slender leg stepped over me to straddle my chest, and as her small frame pushed down on my solar plexus, the force of a truck dropped on me. I couldn’t breathe. My ribcage might have given way at any moment. All the while, her devilish black eyes held my panicked gaze. I fell into them, as if spiritual gravity had shifted, and darkness consumed my vision, except for her.

She retracted her hand with talon-like fingernails, and its texture and surface morphed in shape like some strange tissue. The other hand wrenched my jaw open, and I felt the little air left in my lungs escape. I was completely flattened; my diaphragm unable to move.

She stuck the morphing hand into my mouth. I choked as I felt its shape changing, burrowing down my throat. I gagged against the hand, but it did no good. Tissue expanded down my windpipe and into my lungs. It filled every passageway, every tiny air sack. Like a second pair of lungs inside my lungs. The woman’s smile became harsher, with a look comparable to pleasure on her face. She licked her lips. Then the lungs inside mine began to breath.

As my chest expanded against her weight, I thought all of my ribs might explode into dust. The only reason I could tell my organs weren’t liquid was because each one individually pressed against the wall of my abdomen. This was the most pain I had ever felt in my life. That would have been the perfect moment to die.

Instead, she kept me alive. She kept breathing for me. The breathing was wrong. The air was alien; it made my body cold. I laid there in agony for what must have been hours, each breath increasing the possibility my body would give way. Each breath made the gleam in her eyes more pronounced. The world around me became a deeper black.

I woke up on the couch, gasping for breath and gagging. I painted the purple carpet with vomit, then laid face down in it. Time wasted away. I tried and failed to get up. My lungs burnt, every piece of them charred. I stumbled to my feet, fell towards the door, ran out of the house, got into my car, and sped away.

As I wiped the vomit from my face, I broke down crying. The whooping laughter started.

“Dude, what…the…flip!” said Isaac.

“That was nuts,” said Harris.

“It’s like a sleep paralysis demon that like, harvests your breath. And it breaths for you!”

“Yeah, I was thinking like a succubus with the feminine form.”

“Yeah, I feel like I’ve heard something similar before, it’s the…oh, oh, what’s it called?” Isaac sounded bummed.

“Yeah really demonic. I think it’s great too that the poltergeist was warning him about this with the ‘save your breath’ thing.”

“Oh I didn’t even think of that! Oh, it’s the night hag! She sits on your chest, but this is like, different. Oh man, the imagery of reaching down your throat and filling your lungs. Oh man!”

I threw up on my lap at the memory of the feeling.

“I wish my wife would do that to me,” said Harris, deadpan. Isaac lost it laughing. “Dude, I’m serious, I’d let a goth girl do anything to me.”

“Yeah, dude, just total codependency. I can’t live without my sleep paralysis demon girlfriend,” said Isaac through laughter.

I tuned out after they continued to ridicule my situation and expressed their desire to be dominated by a demon.

They eventually shut up after I washed up at a gas station and threw up again. I’ve been chugging energy drinks since then in an effort to stay awake. I’m never going back to that house. I can get new stuff. Once I finish my shift, I need to find a spot I can stay the night.

Holy shit. I never want that to happen to me again.
