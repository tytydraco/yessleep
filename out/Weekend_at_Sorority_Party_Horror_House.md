When I attended medical school, I pledged to the same sorority as my mother- now a doctor- so I had an advantage, plus I knew a few insider things that helped me join easily.

My favorite initiate ritual- let’s call it that- was to tell scary stories on Halloween in the backyard around a bonfire.  Everyone must tell a story or make one up.

But there is another test.  What the sisters do is tell the story about a medical student at this school who died due to a prank.  She came back to her dorm room after a night out and discovered a severed hand hanging from the light switch cord in her closet.  She opened the closet and shook hands with it, became terrified, then fell over drunk hitting her head on the nightstand, dying later at the university's hospital.  Nobody knows who put the hand there.  This was a medical school, so the right person could obtain a specimen like that easily. 

Now, this isn’t even a true story, it’s from a fictional book but with some details changed.  The initiates/pledges- most of them anyway- haven’t read it.  The ones that have, we tell them to shut the hell up, or face consequences; insisting that the story *is in fact* *true.*  Stacy loves to get into character when she recants the story, she’s a good storyteller, she scares me even. 

What happens next always frightens the non-believers.  Certain members of the sorority pay this guy from the pathology department, (Colin, a former medical student) to obtain a hand specimen, put it in a box, and deliver it to the house dressed as a UPS driver.

Stacy ordered a young, blonde initiate, Kathy, to answer the door when the UPS imposter arrived.

The initiates then are instructed to open the box, and they always freak the fuck out when they see the hand.  Kathy cried when she saw it.  *Jeez girl, this is medical school, get it together.* 

We labeled the box with fake names, pretending it was probably just a gag Halloween gift from an affiliated fraternity, probably the Alpha Betas, a real group of frat bros, but nice guys.  I was dating one in fact, but we had to keep our relationship secret. 

After some time, the sorority heads reveal the hoax to the pledges and then bonds are formed among them, usually.  It’s scary the first time, but fun when you get to see others experience it.

Stacy called me the next morning freaking out that she couldn’t find the box.  I said, “Chill out, you probably just took too much molly last night.  Where are you by the way?”

“I’m here at the lab with Colin, he needs to put it back now or he’ll could get in trouble.  This is serious.”

Fuck!!  I ran downstairs and scanned the house, asking anyone if they’ve seen the UPS box.  Of course nobody did.

I called my boyfriend, Brian, to ask him what to do.

“He jokingly said, just cut off someone else’s hand and replace it.  Easy peazy.”

“No, this is serious.  Ask your frat brothers if they’ve seen anything, please?”

Some of them were at the party last night.

“Okay, I’ll ask ‘em.  Call you back.”

Meanwhile, Stacy called me again, this time she said if there are no cameras in that part of the building (there aren’t, Stacy should know this) then Colin is probably in the clear, he just has to remain silent for a while.

That provided some relief.  But still, where is the hand?  I had a suspicion an initiate took it back to her dorm, either on purpose or by accident, and is probably sleeping it off right now; when she wakes up, she’ll realize her terrible error.

An altogether different thought crossed my mind, maybe some initiates conspired to take it…

We held a mandatory, emergency sorority meeting to try to get some answers.

I was right, one of the girls grabbed the wrong box (where was the ‘right’ box?), then left it accidentally in a dorm social room in a sack full of candy and Halloween crap.  But it’s gone now, a staff member must have it.

“I’m really sorry.” she squeaked.  I knew this girl, she was a friend of Kathy’s.

“Shut up! We’re fucked! How the hell could you do that?”

Stacy was like a banshee that night, the look in her eyes…

Everyone was told to keep their mouths shut or they were out of the sorority, no coming back.  Being in this sorority meant a lot to the initiates, so they all agreed, plus they didn’t really do anything; *that was us.*

Colin showed up at the house unannounced one day, totally freaked out.

“You are not going to believe this, at least one professor knows about the missing hand, and now the cadaver is also missing.”

“You didn’t take that too, did you?” I joked.

“Of course not!!” he yelled.

We sat on the porch and pondered in silence, Colin was worried about getting caught, my mind drifted somewhere else… *Kathy.*

Kathy came to the house crying that she saw an extremely ill-looking woman lying in the grass near the dorms, she might even be dead.  Upon closer inspection, Kathy noticed the woman had only one hand.  Ok, now what to do?

We walked out there with some frat guys, but the woman wasn’t there.

Kathy insisted this was the spot.  Someone was pranking us now.  I bet Kathy is in on it, that little bitch, I’m gonna haze the fuck out of her if she is.

Everyone was distracted by this, and it started to affect our studies, plus the emotional state of others.  Colin was beside himself with worry and drinking heavily.

The holidays came and went, and we didn’t hear a word about the missing cadaver or hand specimen. 

Maybe nobody really knows and Colin is just paranoid.  Other medical students could be pranking *him*, he did say he heard about it from another student.  Medical students love to do this shit.  

Or possibly the staff is embarrassed that the security system is so outdated.  There is nothing to go on. And Colin isn’t an idiot; he wouldn’t leave fingerprints at the scene, and the lab is usually left unlocked, nobody wants to go in there, including me.

After classes an announcement was made to go to the auditorium.  The dean told us a professor from the pathology department reported a missing hand specimen and if anyone knew anything to call the school’s main office and then the police.

Somehow the box ended up in the possession of a detective, so naturally, he and two cops came here to investigate because of the phony label.

Stacy smiled and said somebody probably left it by accident in a lab, inside a box that was originally delivered here for something else.  Some police can’t imagine what kind of lab this could be, but some know.  Just imagine Reanimator.  Yeah, I wouldn’t want to spend time there either.

“And how about the missing cadaver?  Do you know anything about that?”

“No sir.” Stacy said, then bent down to pretend to scratch her leg.

More questions followed, but Stacy is a great actor, and those large breasts of hers distracted the cops.  Fucking men, for real.

“Alright then. If you hear anything, call me.” the detective said, handing me his card.

I told Stacy we needed to perform a hazing ritual to find out who is behind this.

My boyfriend called me; he asked all his brothers if they knew anything and one did.  This guy went back to the dorm with that girl Kathy after the Halloween party.  I knew it!

That night we performed hazing that hasn’t been done in decades, we were not nice that night.  Some girls honestly had nothing to do with it, some cried, but eventually someone said the whole thing was a prank, including the cops. 

It was Kathy.

Stacy kicked Kathy out of the sorority, even though we couldn’t really pin anything on her, we just hated her now, although unfairly.  She only revealed that she knew it was a joke but didn’t actually have anything to do with it, she was just passing along a rumor she heard.  But it was too late, Kathy didn’t want to come back anyway.  I didn’t blame her.

Stacy was nearing graduation and was determined not to let this ruin her last semester.  She wanted to have fun, as did I.  We threw a spring break party, and the girls brought all kinds of drugs and alcohol; the frat guys got it, but who cares, I wanted to get fucked. up.

It was an Eyes Wide Shut-themed party, which was kinda wild.  I remember doing lines of coke with a guy wearing a lamb pagan mask.  Talk about surreal.  This was a great idea I told a drunken Stacy.

“We did it!  Well, you did it, congratulations.  I’m gonna miss you, Stacy.”

We hugged.  All was forgotten about the hand, the cadaver, Colin, Kathy…

Then Kathy was discovered at the party, nobody knew it at first because she was in costume and usually brings other guys with her, or guys follow her.  That night there were three guys following her around the main floor strangely, they moved around together as a group like the Knights who say Ni! and blended in with the crowd, where everyone was wearing masks.  I couldn’t find them; it was so crowded, but Stacy spotted them upstairs.

Stacy went into a rage and kicked Kathy and her friends out with venom.

“Never step foot in this house again!  Do you understand me, you fucking little bitch!”

Stacy then slapped Kathy hard.  Kathy didn’t seem bothered though; she laughed.

She walked right up to Stacy's face, eye to eye, told her to go fuck herself, that her sorority management is embarrassing, that Stacy herself is an ugly, evil witch who will make for a terrible doctor, and that her only appealing feature is her big tits.  Whoa, that was something to witness.  Kathy has balls and did not take shit from Stacy.  I had to hand it to her, no pun intended.  Stacy ran up to her room crying.  Wow.

Kathy and her two guys friends left, laughing out loud down the street.

I didn’t see Stacy the rest of the weekend, but I could understand why.  That tongue lashing was harsh, *and kinda true as well*.

I heard Stacy’s phone ring a couple times, which concerned me because she wasn’t answering it.  She must really be depressed.

I knocked once then entered, Stacy was lying on the floor next to her dresser, I immediately went to her aid.  She was breathing ok but had banged her head on the dresser.  I called 911.

I stood up and saw a person lying in Stacy’s bed in the mirror, a body.  I couldn’t breathe, the smell finally registered- the scent of the rotting dead.   The room began to spin and I fell.  The last thing I recall seeing was the gray flesh and missing forearm of the corpse lying on the bed.

“You’re lucky to be alive, people with head injuries like yours sometimes don’t come back.”

“Come back?” I asked. “Where am I?”

“At University Hospital, and yes, you were out for 5 days, young lady.  Consider yourself lucky, another girl was brought in here with a head injury like yours on the same day.  She didn’t make it, sadly.  Did you know her?  Her name was Stacy.”

I began to cry when two police officers entered the room and asked the nurse to leave, one of them holding a UPS box.
