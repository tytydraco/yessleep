*These people filling my home aren’t my family. I know how that sounds. But I’ve been staring at all ten of my cousins, and I don’t recognize any of them. Not their faces. Not their voices. Not their mannerisms.*

Let me tell you how all of this started:

My brain howled two words as I stood outside my family home.:

WRONG HOME.

The warning came as distant and clear as a fading echo and left me without another word.

What was I supposed to do? I was home, shivering in misty rain in the front of my driveway.

Rain drizzled on the garage I grew up in where my Dad took off my training wheels because my older sister took hers off, and I wanted to be like her. Beside the entrance, a row of spiky plump bushes sat; I fell in them after my friends dropped me off after my first time drinking. And in front of me was the white door, my parents’ door, that they said would always be open if I needed them.

After moving out, I did need them. I hadn’t come back. Who wants to let their parents know that their kid—after failing to move out so late—couldn’t make it in the real world? If anything, that was the real reason I shouldn’t come back.

Before I even knew what I was doing, I heard myself unlocking my car and the steady roll of my suitcase headed back to my Nissan Maxima, passing the rows of cars of my family members already at the festivities.

The door swung open. I shouldn’t have looked back.

My mother stood there. Her smile leapt across her face and then crashed into the happy sadness of tears and smiles.

“My son is home, woohoo!” she cheered, the dramatist of our family. A hint of a tear twinkled in her right eye. She chased me down for a hug. What was I supposed to do?

I walked to her. The thought that I was in the wrong place vanished.

It was like an attack the way my mother collapsed her arms around me; all love, all safety, but that aggressive love that hunts you down.

“Merry Christmas,” I said.

“Merry Christmas,” she said.

The hug felt like home after a vacation that went too long. Maybe that’s what my problem was. My wandering through the real world did seem like a vacation in Hell.

My goal was to lay low and avoid questions from any cousin asking me about my future plans. Things obviously weren’t going great for me—a simple hug from my mother stirred emotion in me.

That didn’t stop my mom though. She strutted me around, proud of me for accomplishing nothing, leading me to her dining room. Pale light lit the fake snow and plastic nutcrackers guarding bowls of popcorn, chips, and punch.

Maybe something about me unsettled them, but everyone greeted me with the same ambivalence I had for them.

Forgettable handshakes.

Quick hugs.

“Oh wow,” to my mom’s braggadocious comments about me, and then we’d move on, leaving them there.

Some of them I hadn’t seen since I was a child and had to take the word of my mom that I ever knew them.

It felt corporate, despite my mom’s efforts. Where were the bear hugs and pats on the back followed by, “You remember me? I hadn’t seen you since—” then they’d say an embarrassing story.

To be honest though, my mom wouldn’t like everyone’s standoffish nature, but I preferred it. No one asked me yet about those hard-pressing questions like, “What do you do these days?”

After our handshake or side-hug, there were only awkward silences, like they waited for me to make the next move. And because I had to say hey to the whole family, the next move was always to leave.

Unfortunately, every good thing must come to an end, and my mom left, telling me to sit and eat, which meant I’d have to socialize and they’d ask me…

Questions

Thankfully, only a minute after she left, my mom burst into the dining room again.

“Okay, time to open presents.” This was the first sprinkle of real joy I felt. I caught myself smiling and sliding out of my chair. Then I realized I was a grown man now. I was supposed to look forward to giving presents, not getting. Plus, there’d be no PlayStation or video game for me below the tree. Probably socks.

We shuffled out to my parents’ tree. My mom stared at us, frowned for a flash, and then went back to smiling.

“Okay everyone, wait one second.” My mom rummaged through the gifts.

“Auntie,” one of my cousins laughed. “What did you do?”

We all laughed. A champion in perfectionism, my mother still wasn’t happy with what looked to all of us to be a perfect Christmas.

With a happy huff, she finished rummaging and faced us. “Oh, it’s just a couple people didn’t make it in today, so we need to move some names around.”

“What?” Someone asked between laughs.

“Yeah, I just pulled some names off gifts, a little mix and match.” Some I saw she held in a tight grip. Odd. It wasn’t like her to give generic gifts.

With a little coaxing, my youngest cousin went under the tree first. I had already forgotten his name. He pulled at his gift, which was in a box that made it look wrapped, but actually you could just take the top off the box.

“You’re slipping,” I joked to my mom.

“What’s wrong?” She asked.

“You always hand wrap your presents.”

“Oh, hush,” she laughed and pointed to my youngest cousin. Once he took the present out of that box, he grabbed another present with his name on it. This one was hand wrapped.

“Still got it,” she laughed. “But do you?”

The room turned to me, one by one. If I wasn’t so anxious, I’d never notice.

“Well, go on, open yours,” Mom said.

“Oh, um, which is it?” I asked.

“Dig and find out.”

Stepping forward, I bent down under the tree, surprised at its height. I could crawl under it without rustling its bottom.

“I don’t see it,” I called back.

“Keep looking,” my mom said.

On my hands and knees, I crawled underneath the tree, a child in wonderland. The smell of Christmas jutting from everywhere, pine needles on the floor, and all of the presents taking me to a happier place than I’d been in years. I gobbled up presents, my presents: a PlayStation 5, collectibles, and a flat green envelope wrapped in red.

I pulled it out, coming up from the tree, and stared at it.

“Oh, thanks,” I said, unsure of what was in it. Money was never my mom’s style, even when that was what I asked for. It was too impersonal.

“Thanks,” I repeated, looking for my mom to thank her and open it in front of her. She loved watching her favorite son (only son) open gifts.

“Where’d mom go?” I asked.

“Oh, she went to handle something,” my Dad said, who I realized I didn’t see all day. “She said don’t open the envelope though until tonight.”

“But it’s Christmas morning.”

“Yeah, I know, but that’s your mother for you,” he shrugged. There was more gray in his beard now.

“Okay, I mean what is she doing on Christmas morning? She works for a church; it’s closed.”

Dad put his hands in the air, proclaiming his innocence. I set my other gifts down and toyed with the envelope in my hand. What could it be? Did I have an inheritance? My parents were renting their home and hadn’t amassed wealth. Maybe it was just a card. They did already get me a lot.

“Excuse me,” a little voice said from below as he tugged my shirt. It was my little cousin… I forgot his name.

“Oh, hi,” I said.

“I did this yesterday,” he whispered to me.

“Did what?” I asked.

“Celebrated Christmas.”

How cute.

“Ohhh, no, yesterday was different. Yesterday was Christmas Eve. That’s like, um, a Christmas preview.”

“No, we did all this yesterday. We celebrated Christmas, not Christmas Eve yesterday,” I listened as his voice strained. “And another stranger came to visit us. Want to see him?”

“What? Um, I’m not a stranger, I’m your cousin.”

“No, you’re not. Yesterday, I was someone else’s cousin.”

“What?”

“Just come see,” he said and pulled me upstairs.

Laughing, I let his little hand pull me up the steps. Bounding to keep the pace, I almost tripped. His reflection flashed against a glass portrait containing a picture of our family: brow furrowed, aged frown, the wrinkles on his head curved. He looked frightening and old for his age.

The bathroom door crashed open with a push.

“Careful,” I said, stopping just outside.

“Come on,” he said. The boy put both hands on mine, but I anchored myself. “Come on.”

“You need to be careful not to break the door.”

“Come on!” He said again and groaned until he gave up. His face softened into an elementary school kid again. “Please,” he asked, and I relented.

He brought me into the bathroom, and my little cousin struggled to push aside the tub curtain. The shower curtain rattled in his attempt. The fabric of the curtain was stuck in the water. Turning his whole body and mustering all the force he could, he pushed the curtain aside.

Blinking in disbelief, I tried to understand what I was seeing. My heart yipped, kicked, and thrashed like it was drowning.

A drowned man floated in the tub… Tall and lanky, his body folded inside the tub. A shaking light blue substance pinballed him inside. It wiggled, hard as ice but as flexible as jello.

I reached out to touch the substance.

My skin smoldered and turned furious red. Ant-sized blisters sprouted in my finger like they were summoned. Slim smoke slithered up from me.

“Don’t touch it,” my little cousin said.

I glared at him. Too late for that.

“How do we get him out of there?”

“I don’t think we can. Everything that touches it melts. They put him here.”

“Who?”

“The people downstairs.”

“My family?”

“They’re not your family.”

“Okay, okay, let’s just leave town and call the police.”

He nodded, grateful.

Rushing downstairs, we tried to say nothing to avoid trouble. We speed-walked as our hearts raced. Try not to look suspicious. Try to look calm and not neat.

Someone asked where we were going. My little cousin screeched; I slammed my hand over his mouth.

I said, “I’m going to show him something in my car real quick.”

“Wait,” Someone said.

I yanked my little cousin so hard I felt his feet leave the ground. With my other hand, I pulled the door open, taking us one step closer to our safety.

Footsteps pounded behind us.

Hurrying out of this trick, we rampaged down the cars parked on the driveway. Mine would be the last of a line of cars on the street. We passed my mom’s silver Lexus. My Dad’s Toyota Camry. A truck, a Subaru, and a Volvo, and then nothing—my car was gone.

“Where, what? How?”

The footsteps found us. It was my dad, exhausted.

“Son, you didn’t drive here.”

“What?”

“We called you an Uber, remember. You flew here. It’s a ten-hour drive.”

“No, I made it. I made the drive.”

“Are you okay?” He asked. “Come inside. Come [home."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
