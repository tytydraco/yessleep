I moved into this neighborhood at the end of January. I was looking for quiet, space, and—if I’m being honest—a reset. I’d just left the city after a breakup, a burnout, and a year I’d rather not relive. The town I landed in isn’t the kind that shows up in travel guides. It’s the kind with rusted-out mailboxes, lawn flamingos, and the faint sound of a radio playing from someone’s garage.

My house is small. Just two bedrooms and a porch that creaks when I lean on the railing. But it’s mine. And for the first time in a while, I felt like I could breathe again.

That feeling lasted all of two weeks.

The first time I noticed Mr. Talbot, it was raining. I was drinking coffee at the window, watching the street disappear behind streaks of water, when I caught sight of him across the road. He was standing in his living room, perfectly still, staring directly out his front window. His lights were off. No TV. No movement. Just him and the dark behind him.

I waved—instinct, I guess—but he didn’t respond. Just turned and walked out of sight.

I figured he didn’t see me. Or maybe he just didn’t care. I mean, people keep to themselves out here. That’s part of the appeal, right?

Still, after that, I started noticing more.

Every evening, just after the streetlights buzzed to life, Mr. Talbot would settle into the same old armchair near his window. Same spot. Same time. Always facing the corner of the room, where there was… nothing. No TV. No bookshelves. Just a blank wall and a dusty lamp that never turned on.

And every night, I’d see his lips move. Slow, deliberate. Like he was explaining something.

At first, I assumed he was talking to someone on the phone. Maybe an old friend. Maybe his wife, if he had one. But I never saw anyone come in or out of that house. No visitors. No cars in the driveway. Not even a dog or cat wandering around inside.

Just Mr. Talbot. Alone. Talking to someone I couldn’t see.

I tried to ignore it. Told myself it wasn’t my business. Maybe he was just eccentric. Or maybe it helped him feel less alone.

But about a week ago, something changed.

It was around 11 p.m., later than I usually stay up. I couldn’t sleep—too many thoughts running in circles—so I sat by the window, sipping on lukewarm tea, and glanced across the street out of habit.

Mr. Talbot was in his chair again.

Only this time… he wasn’t talking.

He was listening.

His head tilted slightly to one side, like a child watching a puppet show. His eyes were locked on that same blank corner of the room. And his mouth hung open, like he was in awe—or fear. I couldn’t tell which.

I squinted through the glass, trying to see if maybe someone was there. Maybe he finally had company.

That’s when he nodded. Slowly. Twice. Then leaned forward in his chair and whispered something I couldn’t hear.

He stayed like that for maybe ten minutes. Then stood up, walked out of the room, and didn’t return.

I waited. Maybe fifteen minutes. Maybe more. Then finally, I gave up and went to bed.

I told myself to stop watching him. It felt wrong, invasive. But you know how your brain fixates on something? Like a loose thread you just have to tug?

Last night, I tugged the thread.

And it unravelled.

I didn’t plan to watch him again. I told myself I was done.

But sometime around 10:30, I found myself back at the window.

No tea. No excuse. Just standing there like a moth drawn to something I didn’t understand.

Mr. Talbot’s house was dark.

No porch light. No living room lamp. Just the dim glow of a streetlight casting long shadows across his lawn.

But he was there. I could make out the silhouette of his armchair. His figure. That same tilt of his head. Facing the corner.

He was talking again.

I leaned in, pressing my forehead lightly to the glass. I didn’t even realize I was holding my breath.

Then something… shifted.

His posture changed. His shoulders pulled back like he was startled. His hands gripped the arms of the chair. And slowly—too slowly—he turned his head toward the window.

Toward me.

Our eyes met.

At least, I think they did. The distance made it hard to tell. But I felt it. Like a pinprick behind my eyes.

He wasn’t looking at me. He was looking through me.

And then—he smiled.

It wasn’t warm. It wasn’t polite. It was the kind of smile you see in dreams that make you wake up cold and sweating.

He lifted one hand and pointed. Not at the corner. Not at the window.

At me.

Then, I swear—I heard it.

Not through the glass. Not through the air. But somewhere else. Inside.

A voice. Low. Calm. Familiar, in the way a shadow under your bed is familiar.

It said:

“He sees you.”

My legs buckled. I stumbled backward, heart pounding so hard I thought I might black out.

When I scrambled to the window again, the chair was empty.

Mr. Talbot was gone.

The light flicked on a second later.

Nothing moved.

I haven’t slept since.

This morning, I watched the house all through sunrise. No sign of him. No signs of life at all. But something tells me… I wasn’t supposed to see that.

And I’m starting to think Mr. Talbot wasn’t talking to someone who isn’t there.

He was warning them.

About me.

I haven’t seen Mr. Talbot since that night.

His chair’s still there. His lights still flicker on at sunset. But the man himself?

Gone.

I keep thinking about that voice. About what it said.

“He sees you.”

I used to think I was the one watching him.

But now… I’m not so sure I ever was.
