Case #2798: The Appalachian Murders

The meeting with Mr. Raines, though frustrating at times, did give me a slight better insight as to what it was I was dealing with. Unfortunately, it’s the farthest thing I wanted my leads to bring me to. I still can not reasonably rule Ms. Blackwell out for the murders in the Appalachian Mountains. I still need to gather more evidence to prove anything that I just found out and stop looking to Ms. Blackwell as my primary suspect.

I assured Ms. Blackwell would have constant surveillance during my time in Asheville to have my interview with Mr. Raines. Upon showing Sheriff Kirkpatrick the letter from my mysterious caller and what I had learned about Cloud Nine not assuring the security of their properties, he agreed to have a deputy monitor everything that happens at the Blackwell estate everyday until I could prove her innocent. After, if I were to prove she hadn’t killed anyone, Sheriff Kirkpatrick would partition to have her placed in witness protection. If the actual killer was out to get her, we’d have to take precautions to prevent another murder from happening concerning this case. 

The cigarette carton I brought for Mr. Raines had to be opened and examined before I was to go into the interrogation room to speak to the convict. My gun and pen being taken away from me before I was allowed in the windowless room with nothing but a table to separate me from the killer. 

Once Mr. Raines was lead in by guards, chained, he slumped down in the metal chair across from me. The guards quickly hooked his cuffs to the table before leaving us alone. He was middle aged, his once brown hair graying on the sides and gray beard scraggly. He appeared tired. Almost like any kind of fight that was left in his buff body was completely gone as he glared at me from across the table. Before I could get a word out, the older man asked for his cigarettes, to which I handed him the carton. Not even asking if I was fine with him smoking in the same room as me, he asked for a light as he placed one of the cigarettes in between his lips. I used the one match I was allowed to bring in and threw it out in the can behind me. As smoke began to fill the room, I asked if I could record out conversation. Mr. Raines only replied with grunt, to which I just assumed was a ‘yes.’

\[RECORDING OF INTERVIEW WITH LEIGHTON RAINES\]

\[WHIRRING OF RECORDER\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: This is Det. Ryan Snow at the \[PRISON NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY\] in Asheville, North Carolina. I am with Mr. Leighton Raines, conducting an interview to understand what took place in Cabin #2 of the Appalachian Mountains. Mr. Raines, do you know why you were imprisoned?

MR. RAINES \[EXHALES SMOKE\]: I killed my fiancé.

DET. RYAN SNOW: Can you tell me why?

MR. RAINES: I blacked out. Went mad. Killed her. I’m telling you what I told the court. 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Do you believe that’s what happened?

MR. RAINES: What I believe and what really happened are irrelevant. I killed Bonnie. It’s as simple as that.

DET. RYAN SNOW: You wrote in the guest book that Bonnie heard something in the attic and that you ignored her.

\[SILENCE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: You stated in it that you told her not to worry, but that the Ouija board hidden up in the attic ended up on the coffee table and you were holding a knife when you-

MR. RAINES: How… How did you know what I wrote in that book…? That the Ouija board was in the attic…?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines, I-

MR. RAINES: I… I had no idea that piece of shit was up there… I didn’t… How’d you’d find out that’s where it came from?

\[SILENCE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines, I’m going to have to ask you to hold off on your questions for a moment and recount every detail you remember when you went to that cabin.

MR. RAINES \[SHUFFLING IN CHAIR\]: Fucking Christ! \[INHALES THEN EXHALES SMOKE\] Fine… I… It was supposed to be a romantic getaway… Just me and… Her… To celebrate our upcoming marriage… I proposed to her on those God forsaken mountains… We hiked and I… 

\[SILENCE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: By “her” you mean… Bon-

MR. RAINES \[SNIFFS\]: Don’t. Don’t say her name. You don’t deserve that… \[INHALES SMOKE BEFORE EXHALING\] … We wanted to get away and just be together… She was getting nervous about the wedding… So, I booked the cabin to get her away from the stress of getting the whole wedding together… Her parents never really cared for our relationship and my best man had gotten the flu, so I knew she wasn’t having the best time getting everyone she wanted together for the wedding… Up there… In that cabin… It was just us… No upcoming wedding… No disappointed parents… No friends who were getting sick or canceling… It was just us… The world… No one else existed except B-… \[INHALES SMOKE THEN EXHALES\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: The guest book, you said she heard noises. When did she start hearing them?

MR. RAINES \[SIGHS\]: Yeah… Yeah, we both heard some noises coming from the attic I think… On our… Third day there? I just thought it was an animal and thought the little dumb ass would find its way out, so I told B-her to just ignore it… I couldn’t open that attic anyway… It was locked. I… 

\[SILENCE\]

MR. RAINES: You… You said that the Ouija board was up there…?

DET. RYAN SNOW: You didn’t know?

MR. RAINES: Of course not! Had I been able to get up in that shitty attic and saw that fucking toy up there, I would have gotten Bon- my… Her… Out of there! I don’t believe in that hocus pocus, but she did and I knew she’d be having a panic attack over it. I brought her there to get away from the stress, not make it… Make it… Worse… The… The attic… It was locked…

DET. RYAN SNOW: I’m sorry?

MR. RAINES: The attic was locked… When the police came… I called them and told them everything I knew… They had gone to the attic to see about the noises I told them about when they asked me to explain what happened… It was still locked… The attic… Said it could only be unlocked and locked again by a key… I hadn’t broken the lock… There was no key… How’d I get that Ouija board…?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines, someone else found the Ouija board up in the attic during their stay in the cabin, there could have been two, the one you had may have come from somewhere else and the one the next tenant found was-

MR. RAINES: Wait, what?

DET. RYAN SNOW: What?

MR. RAINES: There’s been people staying in that cabin after me?

\[SILENCE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Yes…?

MR. RAINES: No… No, no… No, no, no! \[CHAIR SLIDES AS MR. RAINES STANDS\] No one should have gone up there after what happened! That place should be burned down! What happened to me shouldn’t happen to anyone else! It left me to rot in this prison! It wants more! It’ll get more if people go up there!

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines, please, calm down! What do you mean? What are you talking about? What is “it?”

MR. RAINES: What am I…? What kind of detective are you? The Ouija board, me waking up to me killing my Bonnie, the noises! None of this shit is clicking with you?

\[SILENCE\]

MR. RAINES: “It” is a demon! Something from Hell that made me kill my beautiful future wife using that God damned Ouija board!

\[SILENCE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: You’re saying… You were… Possessed…?

MR. RAINES \[SLUMPS BACK IN CHAIR AND INTAKES ANOTHER PUFF OF SMOKE\]: Knew it wouldn’t hold up in court either, so I confessed to just killing her and… And nothing else happened after… No black outs… My cellmate’s a dick, yet I haven’t killed him… Yet… So, I just assumed the demon went back to the cabin to get its next victim. Never told anyone my theory about it, because I knew they’d think I was crazy… 

DET. RYAN SNOW: I thought you didn’t believe in that kind of stuff?

MR. RAINES: I don’t… But that’s all I could understand about how I could have… Killed her… The Ouija board… The knife… My not remembering what happened no matter how hard I try to dig deep enough into my memories to find the answers… I… I don’t remember…

DET. RYAN SNOW: The autopsy… Her heart was missing… You don’t remember taking it…?

\[SILENCE\]

MR. RAINES \[INHALES SMOKE THEN EXHALES\]: No… The police couldn’t find it either… Some people… The press and… People who didn’t fully know about me… Theorize that I… That I… \[SNIFFING\] That I ate her heart… There was blood all over me… Even some around my mouth… So… \[SNIFFING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: People think you… Ate her heart?

MR. RAINES: Some kind of… Ritualistic killing from what I remember them saying… That I communicated with that demon and made a deal with it… Her heart being what sealed our… “Contract…” Christ, it sounds so stupid saying it out loud… I just… I don’t remember messing with that Ouija board or… Anything…

DET. RYAN SNOW: Do you remember anything about that day? The moments before you… Before blacking out?

MR. RAINES: We went for a hike to get her away from those sounds in that attic… They were scaring her and I thought a walk would calm her down… She said she’d been hearing things at night… Was having nightmares of someone telling her things… Telling her I’d been cheating on her… I should have just taken her away from that place, taken her home… \[SNIFFING\] I never should have asked her to marry me… \[INHALES SMOKE THEN EXHALES\] We got back after she seemed to calm down… I opened the door for her and we walked in… That’s… That’s when things went black… That’s all I can remember before blacking out… Before I… Woke up… \[SNIFFING\] God… The fear in her eyes… \[SNIFFING\] 

DET. RYAN SNOW: Was there any indication before the trip that she believed you had been cheating on her?

MR. RAINES: No! No, of course not! I would never! I would never cheat on her! She was everything and I could never see any other girl behind her back like that! No, she was just stressed about the wedding and everything going on, so I just chalked it all up to her mind playing tricks on her. I worried she was getting cold feet and… And I just was so afraid of her… Leaving me…

DET. RYAN SNOW: I see. Did you worry for a while, even before the trip, that she would leave you?

MR. RAINES: I… I had my concerns… But then she said ‘yes’ when I asked her to marry me… I thought all those feelings… All those worries, all the back lash from her family… I thought it would all go away… Then I booked… That… Fucking cabin… \[INHALES SMOKE BEFORE EXHALING\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Did you book the cabin through Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals?

MR. RAINES: Cloud Nine Vacation…? No, I booked it through some bitch named… Ah… Alba Larson? She said she was the landlord. I booked it through her.

DET. RYAN SNOW: How did you come across her contact information?

MR. RAINES: I was looking up places in the mountains to book a place for us… Posted on Facebook for any recommendations and she reached out to me… She vanished off the fucking Earth, so the police couldn’t find her.

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines… Someone did indeed book themselves in that cabin after you. Many did actually, but only one of them booked through Mrs. Larson. Everyone else booked through Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals. That person is under suspicion of murder as well. Now, the thing about Mrs. Larson, is that she’s been dead since 2005 and the property was bought out by Cloud Nine when no one could locate any family of Mrs. Larson.

\[SILENCE\]

MR. RAINES: Y-You’re… You’re fucking with me… 

\[SHUFFLING SOUND OF DET. RYAN SNOW TAKING OUT A PHOTO OF MRS. LARSON AND HER DEATH CERTIFICATE, PLACING IT ON THE TABLE\]

MR. RAINES: Th-That’s… That’s… That’s her… She’s the one I spoke to about… What the fuck…? What the actual fuck?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines, are you absolutely, one-hundred percent, sure that you killed your fiancé?

MR. RAINES: I don’t know… I don’t know… I… I can’t remember… Someone else is accused of murder…?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Yes. They booked the cabin through Mrs. Larson and went through something similar as you did. They heard sounds in the attic, heard voices, and found a Ouija board in the attic. There were five of them and one was accused of murdering the other four. However, her story matches yours in a way and I believe there may be someone either impersonating Mrs. Larson or just some sick killer luring people to that cabin to kill them. Why they’re leaving you and this other person is what I’m also trying to figure out. I can’t rule out anything. I can’t say for certain that you’re both innocent. They could have looked up your story, did some digging, and repeated everything that happened to get away with it. I’m still trying figure out if you both did indeed speak to a Mrs. Larson, or if you just made all that up. 

MR. RAINES: Well I spoke to someone! That’s for damn sure, but how the hell could they have been dead for five years?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Exactly. You’re saying you were possessed. This person also believes they were framed by something that didn’t show itself until they got the Ouija board. I don’t believe for one second it was something supernatural, but it definitely has something to do with the occult. You said your wife believed in that stuff, yes?

MR. RAINES: Y-Yeah…

DET. RYAN SNOW: I see. 

MR. RAINES: So, now what? 

DET. RYAN SNOW: If you have nothing else to offer, I’ll need to take my leave and continue my investigation on this current suspect. If I can prove that they’re innocent and see if I can find out who the real killer is, I will have the court petition to release you and clear you of the murder.

MR. RAINES: And if you can’t?

DET. RYAN SNOW: Then you and my current suspect are going to be imprisoned for a very long time and those cabins will remain.

\[CHAIR CLATTERING\]

MR. RAINES: No! No, you can’t let that place remain open to the public! If what you say is true, then that place needs to be burned down! Whether or not a demon is to blame for my Bonnie dying, there’s seriously something wrong with that place!

DET. RYAN SNOW: Mr. Raines, there’s nothing I can do about the cabins after I prove or disprove you and this person. What happens to them is up to nature at this point as I also plan on taking down Cloud Nine. They failed you and this person, despite the kind of people you could turn out to be. I’m afraid that’s all I can give you and all you can give me… \[CHAIR SLIDES AS DET. RYAN SNOW STANDS\]

MR. RAINES: Wait! Wait!

DET. RYAN SNOW: Yes?

MR. RAINES: I… I remember… One last thing… I remember… Something after I woke up from my black out… 

DET. RYAN SNOW: And that is?

MR. RAINES: Howling…

DET. RYAN SNOW: Howling?

MR. RAINES: Yes, howling.

DET. RYAN SNOW: It’s the mountains.

MR. RAINES: I just- you- mother fuck- \[DEEP BREATH\] I understand that and I thought the same thing, but there was something… Off about it… It wasn’t until I got off the phone with the police that I heard it… That howling… I thought it was a mountain lion at first or maybe a group of coyote… But… It sounded… Almost human… An animal… I can’t describe it, but… It still haunts me…

\[CREAKING NOISE\]

DET. RYAN SNOW: Best of luck to you Mr. Raines. I’m sorry for your loss.

MR. RAINES: Dick-

\[END OF RECORDING\]

As I stated before, my conversation with Mr. Raines did give me more of an insight to what I was dealing with in the Blackwell case, but it was leading me down a hole I did not want to fall into. Demons? Possession? Things I never believed in. Everything had a far more reasonable, rational answer to it. Things that went bump in the night didn’t exist.

Unfortunately, anything else I tried putting together to make this puzzle were not fitting. Both Ms. Blackwell and Mr. Raines stated that they had spoken or at least exchanged communication with Mrs. Larson to book the cabin. They both, or at least Ms. Collins when she visited with Mr. Raines, heard sounds and voices coming from a locked attic. And they both had experiences with the Ouija board. Mr. Raines having no idea how he had gotten it from the attic which was still locked when he woke up from his black out. 

There was just one last piece. The howling that Mr. Raines heard after his supposed murder of Ms. Collins. Ms. Blackwell had never mentioned to me about any howling during her time in those mountains. I’m going to conduct one last interview with Ms. Blackwell. If her answers bring me to another dead end, I will have no other choi

\[BEEPING OF LINE GOING DEAD\]

I need to talk to Ms. Blackwell. I need to know what the hell is going on. This can’t be real. It just can’t be what I’m starting to believe it is.
