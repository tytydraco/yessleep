TW: child loss, murder, insanity

Part 2/2 (Part 1 in comments) 

My whole body went numb. I was shaking. 

That.... It couldn't be her. But deep down I could feel it, it was her. Kristen had gone off the deep end. When she had said Amara was back I expected a ghost, something supernatural. But what Amara was... It was worse. 

The stench of death floated from where her bones sat. They were tied together with string, and I could see hot glue sloppily dripping down some parts of where the bones connected. Half of her jaw had disconnected and was hanging from her face. She was propped up by various objects, giving the illusion of sitting. 

"Kristen," I choked, "what have you done." 

I felt her hand on my shoulder and jumped as she whispered to me. "I brought our daughter back. Her grave was trapping her but I saved her." 

I was shaking my head, fear and adrenaline clouding my thoughts. "But the brush, creaky floors and the giggle I-"

"Oh that was just me preparing your surprise." Kristen giggled. Actually 𝘨𝘪𝘨𝘨𝘭𝘦𝘥. 

And it sounded just like the one I heard before work. Kristen was insane. She dug up our daughters bones. God knows how she got the brush back, she might've just bought it but I wouldn't put digging through a landfill past her. 

I collapsed to the floor, and suddenly realized Kristen had left. The soulless eyes of our dead daughter's skull seemed to bore into me. 

"Amara?" I choked, but there was no sound.

I wanted to leave, to get out of this awful place. This wasn't real life it couldn't be, I must be going insane.

"Was it enough? Will you stop seeing Vikki?" 

Kristen had appeared again, from the kitchen. She was holding a butcher knife. 

I loved Vikki, and would never stop seeing her, but I wasn't about to tell this psycho that. 

"Of course darling," I forced myself to stand on shaky legs, plastering a false smile on my face, "I love you so much. You did so good bringing her back." 

Kristen looked relieved and put the knife on the table. She went in for a hug, and I made a split-second decision. As my arms wrapped around her I grabbed the knife and plunged it into her back. I heard her gasp, and she pushed away from me. I could see the betrayal in her eyes, the hurt. 

It didn't last long, though. I don't know where I hot but it must've been important because within a minute, she was dead. 

I could feel myself getting numb as I looked at Kristen. She had a single tear running down her face, and her eyes were empty. She looked... Innocent. 

I felt an intense stab of guilt, I did this to her. I cheated on and hated her because of Amara's death. She didn't deserve that. For the first time in a long time, I remembered the Kristen from before. Kind, sweet, gentle, and overall, a wonderful wife. 

She was my everything... What had I done? 

"I'll make it up to you." I whispered. 

I dragged my wife's body up the stairs and laid her in our bed. Kissing her on the cheek, I smiled at her. 

"You can rest now honey." 

I went back downstairs to grab my daughter, and humming a tune, I laid her in bed next to my wife. My perfect family. 

I smiled and gave each of them a kiss on the cheek before laying down beside them. 

In the morning, I got up and went to work. I pushed through the day, just wanting to see my wife again. 

But once I was finished, I went to see Vikki. I'd been cheating on my wife with her for twelve years, and I'm terrified to stop. I'd seen what lengths broken-hearted women will go to to get the one they love back, and I couldn't risk it.

After Vikki was satisfied I finally got to go home. My real home. The smell inside was rancid, death choking every hallway. But it was worth it, to have my family again. 

I approached Kristen and Amara, and grinned, my heart feeling more full than ever before. 

"Honey, I'm home."

Although she couldn't respond, I knew she'd heard me, and I could've sworn that for a moment, I could see the love shining in her cold dead eyes.
