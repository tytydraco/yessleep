TW: Child Abuse

&#x200B;

On my last post, someone commented joking about what our mayor’s campaign posters looked like. It made me laugh a lot, but our mayor’s story is actually a pretty interesting one, so I’m gonna tell you guys about it. I took a trip to visit her the other day to refresh my memory on how exactly everything happened, but I wasn’t really present, seeing as I was in high school when all this happened, so I’ll tell it the best I can.

&#x200B;

Jane was in her 80s when the chaos with the drug and everything went down. She had lived with her husband in the same house for the last 50 years. They had never been able to have children, something that caused them great sorrow, but they had each other to get through it all. So obviously, it hit her pretty hard when he passed away.

&#x200B;

Despite it all, Jane was the nicest woman you’d ever meet. She always let kids play in her front yard, she would bake cookies for everyone in the neighborhood, and she always remembered the little details that you’d never expect her to. I used to walk past her house on my way to school, and one day, she asked me how my day was going. I told her I had a math test I was pretty worried about, and when I passed by the next day, she asked me how it went.

&#x200B;

Jane was one of the people who signed up for the trial, she says it’s because she felt she could use the extra money since she was retired, and she was old, she had nothing to lose. She was ready for death. She’d made peace with it, and she was ready to see her husband again.

&#x200B;

Of course, that’s not what happened.

&#x200B;

All things considered, though, Jane was pretty lucky. The only tangible thing that the drug did to her was make her invisible. Nothing on her body turned invisible, though, so you could still see her disembodied floral blouse and pink skirt sitting on the rocking chair of her front porch every day. Honestly, not much had changed for Jane, except for the whole probably-living-forever thing.

&#x200B;

She told me she noticed immediately. She knew her body was still there, she could feel it with her hands, everything was exactly it used to be, shape-wise. However, she no longer had any pain in her body, in fact, she couldn’t feel anything in her body. She had no heartbeat, no breath, and she felt rejuvenated in a way she hadn’t felt in decades. She was worried about this initially. She had been alive for over eight decades, and she had made peace with death. She didn’t know what there was left to do with her life.

&#x200B;

And then the trouble started with the mayor. The current mayor at the time. Mayor Jimmy.

&#x200B;

Jimmy was also a victim of the drug, but in the chaos following, he had been deemed safe to be in society and to continue living as he did. Honestly, he seemed perfectly mentally unchanged, the same jovial guy we’d all known and voted for before. He looked pretty fucked up—think the ghost from Spirited Away meets the Babadook—but once you got over the hollow black eyes, the porcelain smile with an eerie amount of teeth, his fucking voice, and the incorporeal body, he was just as pleasant as before.

&#x200B;

Or so we thought. Actually, while I know some people say the drug was at fault for what Jimmy did next, I think something was always wrong with him. It had to be.

&#x200B;

Some time later, girls started to go missing. Young girls from all over the town going off to school or to see their friends and never being seen again. The first was Samantha. She was six years old, and she never made it on the school bus.

&#x200B;

The town was in shambles, obviously. It seemed impossible. Girls were disappearing from crowded locations with no witnesses and no explanations. The details were getting fuzzy too. Some would swear they saw Samantha get on the bus, while some say they never even saw her at the bus stop. The police implemented a buddy system and a curfew. No children were allowed to go anywhere alone, and all had to be in their homes by seven.

&#x200B;

This made things worse, somehow. Children were still disappearing, and this time, their buddies would return home with no explanation of where their friends went, and children started disappearing from their homes with no sign of a break-in or anything. 12 were missing now, and people started pointing fingers at each other. I was a 16 year old boy, nowhere near the kidnapper’s demographic, and yet my parents kept me holed up in the house, sending shifty glances at anybody who walked by.

&#x200B;

This is where Jane comes in. Jane was taking a walk in the woods one day, a habit that, she was rather embarrassed to admit, she did naked. She liked to see the wildlife up close, and she didn’t scare them off when they couldn’t see her coming. She had gotten within inches of beautiful deer, adorable squirrels, and all manner of little critters. I’m not judging because if it weren’t for her nudity, she probably wouldn’t have been able to pull off what she did.

&#x200B;

Anyway, one day she’s out on the woods, and she sees a little girl walk by. She recognized the girl as Pauline, one of the girls who lived on her street. Jane was going to quietly slip away, but she noticed that something looked off about the girl. Her eyes were wide and unblinking, red and tearing up from the effort of keeping them open, and her movements were jerky and stiff.

&#x200B;

And then she heard the voice.

&#x200B;

“That’s it, keep walking towards me.”

&#x200B;

It was a creepy rattle of a hiss that sounded like a million voices layered over each other, young, old, male, female. It echoed in the space around them, and Pauline nodded and kept walking.

&#x200B;

Jane recognized that voice. All of us would’ve, it was so distinctive, off-putting, and so different from the friendly, booming laugh its owner used to have.

&#x200B;

It was Mayor Jimmy.

&#x200B;

Jane started to follow Pauline. She was terrified, of course, she was a little old woman who had never come across a situation like this in her life, but she loved the kids in the neighborhood, the ones she’d never been able to have herself, she still does. So this poor, naked 82 year old woman crept as quietly as she could behind her to confirm her suspicions.

&#x200B;

And sure enough, creeping up behind a tree like curling black smoke, was Jimmy.

&#x200B;

“Follow me,” he said, and Pauline followed. So did Jane.

&#x200B;

She followed them all the way back to an old cabin, the cabin used to belong to Sarah Herman before the sacrifice, which is a story way too long for me to include here, but trust me when I say, it had been empty since. Nobody wanted to go near it. Dread filled her heart. It was the perfect spot for a serial killer to take his victims.

&#x200B;

Jane managed to slip in through the door after Jimmy and Pauline, and what she saw made her swallow her vomit and choke back her tears. The 12 missing girls, or what was left of them, strewn around the room. Blood soaked the walls, even the ceiling. Organs draped over stair railings and shelves. And there was little Samantha’s decapitated, tongue-less head, staring up at her with dead, cold eyes.

&#x200B;

Sorry, I know that’s a really fucked up thing to read, but I’m really trying to hammer home what Jimmy did, so when I tell you what ended up happening to him, you’ll know it was well-deserved.

&#x200B;

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Anyway, Jane watched as Jimmy told Pauline to sit on a chair that was probably wooden, but so caked in blood and grime that it was impossible to tell. Jane wondered what the hell she was going to be able to do to get Pauline out of this. Mayor Jimmy clearly had powers none of us had known about, and she was just an invisible old woman. But despite the fear she felt, she knew she had to try.

&#x200B;

Thinking fast, Jane crept to a bookshelf next to the kitchen door and, praying he wouldn’t see her pick them up, tossed two books into the kitchen. They dropped on the floor with an audible thud.

&#x200B;

Jimmy whipped around towards the source of the noise. His empty eye sockets seemed to be piercing right through Jane, and she held her breath and prayed. He stalked—or I guess, floated—right past her into the kitchen, and Jane let out a sigh of relief before she sprung into action.

&#x200B;

Heart pounding, she grabbed Pauline and booked it out the door. She sprinted through the woods, hoping just to make it into town where somebody could hopefully help her. Then she heard a whoosh of noise behind her, like thunder, and a ghastly screech that turned her blood cold.

&#x200B;

She ran faster, but Jimmy was gaining on her.

&#x200B;

“Paulineeeeee, get the FUCK back here!”

&#x200B;

Jane slammed her hands over Pauline’s ears the moment he started speaking, but she knew it was only a matter of time before he caught up to them. She would have to think of something. And fast.

&#x200B;

And then she had an idea. The darkest idea she had ever had.

&#x200B;

She turned and started running towards the newly built facility, where the worst of the worst were contained, where, in the basement, under the strongest and most heavily guarded protection, lived Tommy, Pauline’s four-year-old little brother.

&#x200B;

I asked her how in God’s name she managed to sneak in there, but I guess at the time, security was light as nobody really knew what these creatures were capable of, and the workers were spread thin with the chaos and their duties. So, she got in. I’ll spare you all the little details for the sake of time, but I will say she told me she felt like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible, so just picture Tom Cruise if he was a naked old woman sneaking into a Denny’s, which is what I’m equating the security at the time to now that I’ve heard about it, and I’m sure you’ll kind of get the picture.

&#x200B;

Jimmy followed her into the facility, still screaming for Pauline. Don’t know how he hadn’t figured out who was with her or why Pauline was floating in the air like a sack of potatoes, but hey, I guess he wasn’t the smartest guy—didn’t need to be with powers like his—and he was probably blinded by rage.

&#x200B;

Jane continued to run blindly, forcing her legs to keep going despite how much she wanted to cower and hide, She ran into the basement and yelled for Tommy.

&#x200B;

“Oh? Who’s there?”

&#x200B;

It was Jolene. Our favorite Dolly Parton song. Well, mine’s “9 to 5”, but whatever.

&#x200B;

“It’s Jane,” she said, “I’m looking for Tommy.”

&#x200B;

“I’m here!”

&#x200B;

Tommy’s voice is kind of horrendous to hear, picture a little boy mixed with a wolf who is also Satan and also regularly chain-smokes cigarettes made out of corpses’ ashes, so needless to say, I was cringing the entire time Jane recounted this conversation.

&#x200B;

“Hi, Miss Jane! I’m down here! Did you come to visit me?”

&#x200B;

Jane crept towards the cell from which Tommy’s voice emanated. I told her I probably would’ve hightailed it out of there at that point, but all she said in response to that was, “I’m not afraid of little Tommy, he’s such a sweet boy.”

&#x200B;

I think we have different definitions of sweet.

&#x200B;

“Hi, Tommy,” She responded, “I’m here with Pauline.”

&#x200B;

“Pauline!” Tommy cheered, and multiple layers of giggles echoed through his cell, “I missed Pauline! My mommy and daddy haven’t come to visit me, and I’m so lonely.”

&#x200B;

Then, he caught sight of Pauline, draped over Jane’s shoulder, and the giggles stopped all at once.

&#x200B;

“Miss Jane, what happened to Pauline?”

&#x200B;

“A bad man is trying to hurt her,” Jane said, “A very bad man. He’ll be down here soon to try and hurt her again.”

&#x200B;

Tommy was silent for a moment before he erupted into sobs. Ghastly wails and high-pitched screeches echoed throughout the basement. Jane’s attempts to calm him were in vain, after all, he was a four year old boy.

&#x200B;

It was to this cacophony of sound that Jimmy entered the basement.

&#x200B;

“Paulineeeee!” He screeched.

&#x200B;

Tommy’s sobs paused.

&#x200B;

“The bad man?” He hiccuped, sniffling his tears.

&#x200B;

“Yes,” Jane responded, “Don’t worry, Tommy. We’ll make sure he doesn’t hurt your sister. But I’m going to need you to be very quiet for a second.”

&#x200B;

Jane carried Pauline’s unresponsive body to a back corner in another hallway, and then ran back to Tommy’s cell. Then, doing her best to overcome the debilitating terror she felt, she began to execute her plan.

&#x200B;

“We’re over here!” She called to Jimmy.

&#x200B;

Jimmy slithered over.

&#x200B;

“Jane? Is that you?” He scoffed, stalking towards her, “You stupid, old BITCH, do you have ANY idea who you’re up against? I can do ANYTHING, ANYTHING I want. And there’s NOTHING you can do about it. I can make anyone do anything I tell them to! I can make people forget, I can make people follow me, sit quietly while I tear their organs out, ANYTHING!”

&#x200B;

He laughed, “And you can’t even kill me! I can’t die!”

&#x200B;

“It doesn’t matter,” Jane responded, “Pauline is in this cell where you can’t get to her. These were built for creatures like you, you can’t get in or out.”

&#x200B;

The bait was laid, and now Jimmy had to take it.  Jimmy’s porcelain smile stretched wider, more and more teeth coming into view.

&#x200B;

“We’ll see about that.”

&#x200B;

And then his smoke-like form dissipated into Tommy’s cell. Jane let out a sigh of relief. It had worked. Jimmy crept further into the cell, calling for Pauline.

&#x200B;

“You…” Tommy rasped.

&#x200B;

“Who’s there?” Jimmy asked.

&#x200B;

“YOU’RE TRYING TO HURT MY SISTER!”

&#x200B;

First, one loud, wet noise, and then the screams started. Not Tommy’s screams this time, but Jimmy’s.

&#x200B;

“Oh, dear,” Jolene said, “Bye, bye, Mayor Perv.”

&#x200B;

“JANEEEE!” Jimmy wailed, “HELP MEEE, HELP MEEE, PLEASE!”

&#x200B;

Jane ignored him and went to go retrieve Pauline.

&#x200B;

“JANE, PLEASE I’M SORRY, I’LL TURN MYSELF IN, JUST HELP ME, PLEASE, IT HURTSS!”

&#x200B;

Visceral sounds of gore emanated from the cell, a harmony to the melody of Jimmy’s screams.

&#x200B;

Jane picked Pauline up and began to carry her towards the exit from the basement.

&#x200B;

Tommy had started crying again, bellowing sobs that echoed against the walls, another note in the symphony of pain occurring inside his little cell.

&#x200B;

“YOU HURT MY SISTER YOU HURT MY SISTER YOU HURT MY SISTER!” He screeched so loudly that the walls shook.

&#x200B;

“Bye, Miss Jane,” Jolene said as Jane exited the basement, “Take care.”

&#x200B;

Jane brought Pauline back to her parents, and told the whole story. We’ll never know exactly what the truth was, seeing as Jimmy most definitely is not around to tell it, and Pauline couldn't remember a thing, but we managed to piece the story together from what she told the town.

&#x200B;

Mayor Jimmy probably had some sort of mind control ability. He used it to hide his abilities from the facility workers and get cleared to return to his normal life, and then he used it to kidnap and murder the little girls undetected. You’re probably wondering by now why his powers didn’t work on Jane, but I didn’t want to spoil the story by telling you beforehand, and honestly we don’t really know. Our best guess is that his powers required some sort of eye contact or facial recognition or something, something you can’t do with an invisible woman.

&#x200B;

Like I said before, lots of people think the drug fucked with his mind, turned him into a person who could do these things, but I disagree. As you’ve read this story, you’ve probably realized how stupid Jimmy is. I think what kept him from acting on his dark urges prior to his transformation was his own stupidity. He knew he couldn’t get away with it until he got an ability that guaranteed he could.

&#x200B;

Anyway, after hearing about her immense bravery in the face of death, a bunch of people nominated Jane to take over as mayor. She said she didn’t want the job, that she didn’t have the skill set for such important work, but the election vote was near unanimous. She’s been the mayor ever since.

&#x200B;

“I never had any kids,” she said to me once she finished her story, “And now I have a whole town full of them.”

&#x200B;

As for Jimmy, if any of you care to know, I was down in the basement the other day for work stuff, and as I walked by Tommy’s cell, I heard a weak voice call out to me.

&#x200B;

“Help me…”

&#x200B;

But before I could fall into any trance of suggestibility, then came Tommy screaming, “SHUT UP,” a crunching noise, a sob of pain, and then nothing.

&#x200B;

20 years later and still Tommy’s chew toy. He bragged to Jane about not being able to die, and now I bet he wishes he could more than anything. Can’t say I’m upset about it.
