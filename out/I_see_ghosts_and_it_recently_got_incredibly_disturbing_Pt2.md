Apologies to those who wanted to know more. 

I could hear her downstairs. I can still hear her but I think I trapped her in the basement, at least for the time being. 

When I got home from the funeral it was a few days of silence, spending my time with my family and mourning. But on the third night things got a little strange. It started with sounds that weren’t uncommon in a house with three cats, such as thumps, things falling over, small noises that were a mix between cries and meows. Typical rambunctious cat household noises. 

But then after thinking about it more, I realized all the cats were in my room with me. So I went to investigate, I found my broom was knocked over and the front door unlocked. I may have forgotten to lock it but I have never forgotten. 

A few days later I could hear more activity at night. I knew it wasn’t my cats since they were in my room, I also noticed things moving. My keys being misplaced, paperwork vanishing, single shoes going missing. Odd things. 

My cats also started acting strange around this time. They were sleeping with me a lot more, I found they were avoiding the basement door. This is odd as their cat tree is directly next to it.

I honestly thought that in my grief I was just loosing my marbles a little bit. Until the 25th of last month. 

We had a blistering heat wave. 42 Celsius. Unfortunately I don’t have air conditioning, so I decided to go spend some time in the basement as it would be much cooler down there. 

Instantly a bad idea, I went downstairs and it was freezing. Think, walk in freezer cold. When I turned on the lights I also noticed all my neatly packed things were completely ravaged through. As if I needed something in a rush with no idea where it was- except I hadn’t been down there in months. 

I can’t remember being afraid like that in a long time. I rushed upstairs but as I was opening the door to leave the basement I stood frozen, as I could not move, with the burning cold feeling of a hand on my shoulder. I stood there for what felt like 10 minutes listening to the entity speak to me. When she finally released me I escaped and I now have a chair propped under the knob so it cannot be opened. 

I don’t know when I will be able to go downstairs again, I don’t know who I brought home, and I am terrified. Now that I know she’s there and she knows that I can feel her she is angry. 

I still don’t fully understand what she meant, but I know I heard her voice clear as day. 

“I need you to understand, I will make you understand.” 

Since then there has been loud banging in the basement. I really don’t know what to do, my family doesn’t know what to tell me either. 

The banging has gotten quite a bit louder as I’ve been typing this out. Two of my cats are hiding in my room with me, they rushed in here once the banging got louder. One of my cats has started screaming at the basement door which is incredibly out of her character. 

I think it’s my cat, although I’m not too sure.
