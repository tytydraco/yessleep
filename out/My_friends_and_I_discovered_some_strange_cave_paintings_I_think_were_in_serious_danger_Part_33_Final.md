Terror stabbed through my chest like a metal spike. My arm shot to the lamp on the nightstand. Julia wasn’t in the room. The metal lock was dangling from its chain. I cursed myself for not staying awake, and hurriedly threw on some shorts. I sprinted to the lobby, much to the desk worker’s dismay.

“No running, sir.”

“Sorry. My friend is g-gone. She disappeared. I need help,” I wheezed, struggling to gulp down enough air to satiate my burning lungs.

“Alright. What did she look like?”

“She’s a short brunette with really blue eyes.”

“I’m sorry, sir. I haven’t seen anyone matching that description my whole shift.”

“Well, can you check the cameras?”

“The cameras are out of order.”

“Damnit, are you serious?! They told me they’d be fixed by now!”

“Sir, I need you to remain calm. I’ll help you however I can, but I need you to be civil.”

“Civil? My friends are all missing and you want me to be ‘civil.’ I’m losing my fucking mind here! One of them was seemingly possessed by this thing named Malsumis and now they’re just gone!”

“Excuse me, did you say Malsumis?”

I spun around. An aging native american woman stood before me, supported by a walker. An ornately decorated shawl shrouded her head. She frowned, a dire expression written across her countenance.

“Uh, yeah.”

“Come, sit.”

I obeyed, and uneasily plopped into a seat opposite her. She laboriously sunk into her chair. Her withered lips parted, and the words that spilled out chilled me to my core.

“Legend has it that many centuries ago, an Abenaki witch doctor was exiled from his tribe for practicing black magic. He traveled hundreds of miles, traversing the treacherous untamed wilderness, until he could not journey any further. He relocated here in San Jose, long before the settlement existed. Even so, he was paranoid, and to keep his occult rituals hidden from prying eyes, he began practicing in a cave. It is said that he summoned Malsumis, a heinous, sinister Abenaki god, to exact revenge on those who banished him from his homeland. The village elders each succumbed to various illnesses soon after. According to the legend, Malsumis still resides in that cave, claiming any unfortunate souls who wander inside.”

I stared at her incredulously. She didn’t really expect me to believe that, did she? I pondered for a moment. Even if the story was fabricated, she might still be able to offer me some sort of information to aid in finding my comrades.

“Okay, so assuming that’s all true, how do I find my friends? Has anyone ever come out of there alive?”

“I’m sorry, sweetheart. Your friends are dead. You need to get far *far* away from here, lest you be subjected to the same fate.”

“That can’t be right. Maybe the legends aren’t true. Maybe I can-”

“No. You need to leave, first thing in the morning, and pray that you make it through the night. Once Malsumis has seen your face, he won’t let you escape him easily.”

She painstakingly rose to her feet and began to hobble away.

“In the morning, young man. Don’t let him claim you as well.”

I gaped at her, baffled, as she disappeared from sight. Seeing no other option, I trudged back up to my empty hotel room. The woman’s revelation rang in my head like a gong. I began mulling over my next move, conflicted on how to proceed. I planned to stay up for the remainder of the night, but the adrenaline had begun to diffuse from my system, and my eyelids grew heavy.

I forced open my eyes. I was standing at the mouth of a cave. Unbridled horror jolted me to my senses. How did I get here? Against my will, I began drifting into the cavern. Sweat dripped from my forehead, and my palms perspired heavily. I wasn’t in control of my body. It was like riding in the passenger seat of a car.

I floated past the cave paintings, much deeper than my friends and I had previously ventured. The freezing air chilled my bones as I continued on. After what felt like an eternity of snaking through the winding underground system, I stopped. My eyes grew wide as saucers.

Before me was a room. Hundreds and hundreds of bones protruded, half encased from the walls, in varying states of decay. I saw them. Andrew was suspended from the ceiling. His appendages dangled lifelessly from the stone holding him in place. Stacey’s hollow stare pierced my gaze. Only the right side of her jutted from the rock. And Julia. All that was exposed was her face, stuck in a permanent, soundless scream. At the center of the carnage stood a figure.

A cloak blanketed his frame, casting a shadow over his features that effectively obscured him from view. A wilted gray hand clutched a staff bearing the head of a wolf with glowing red eyes at its point. Loathing hatred permeated his aura, filling the space with a sense of impending doom. My heart shattered for my friends and the countless other victims encased in the surrounding walls. He drew his hand to his face, slipping the hood from his head.

Black pupils eclipsed his scleras, boring twin holes in my chest. He smiled, showcasing rows of jagged mangled teeth. He raised his wooden cane, that wicked grin sending a chill rippling through my body. Every corpse that still had mobility of its mouth began to chant in some arcane tongue that I could not comprehend. I involuntarily floated toward the deity.

So this was it. This was how I was going to die. Images of the last conversation I’d had with my abuelita flashed through my head. She’d never know what became of me. Left in her final days to wonder why I’d never come home, hoping, begging God to return me to her someday, to no avail. A solitary tear rolled down my cheek. No. I couldn’t do that to her.

I fought with every ounce of strength I had. I gradually regained control of my fingers, wiggling them free of whatever malevolent force was playing puppeteer. Once I’d accomplished that, the rest of my extremities followed suit. I had nearly completed my unwilling trek to face the man, but I’d managed to stop myself just in time. The abhorrent sorcerer glowered at me, slamming his staff against the ground. The cadavers began to scream, a cacophony of lamented shrieks reverberating off the walls.

I didn’t stick around to find out what was next. I bolted out of there, retracing my steps, until I burst from that godforsaken hellscape and into the warm morning light. I crumpled to my knees, wet sand clinging to my legs, and I cried. I cried for Andrew and Stacey, knowing that I’d never again hear their boisterous laughs or witty banter. I cried for Julia, longing just to hold her one last time. And I cried for myself. I’d come so close to becoming just another stroke of paint in a ghastly mural of death.

Another tourist found me there, sobbing on the ground. They called the police, and after hours of questioning, they allowed me to return home. I hugged my abuelita tighter than I ever had in my entire life when she arrived to pick me up.

To my knowledge, the authorities never investigated that cave. I think they know what horrors lurk within those stone walls. That was years ago. I’ve moved myself and my abuelita far from the west coast. So why share this now? Why dredge up those awful memories? Well, last night I awoke in the street with no memory of how I ended up there. And ever since, I can’t suppress that archaic malevolent voice so desperate to worm its way back into my head.
