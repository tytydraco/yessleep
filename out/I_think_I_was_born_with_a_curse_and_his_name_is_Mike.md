As far as I am aware, nobody else has ever had whatever it was that I had. Or maybe some might have, but it has just been misdiagnosed as any number of other unrelated ailments by whoever they went to see about it. Throughout my life, I had seen countless doctors, been referred to the utmost specialist of specialists in fields ranging from niche personality disorders to rare brain trauma responses. Everybody had an answer and a medication I needed to take thrice daily, but nothing ever worked; Mike never stopped hurting me whenever we were alone together. 

Mike had always been there, as far back as I can remember. I’m sure his face was looming down on me every night I slept in my crib, that smell of tobacco and pungent aftershave familiarising itself with my nostrils. He was most likely even in the delivery room with my Mum and Dad for my birth, standing behind all the oblivious doctors and nurses just going about their jobs. Mike was intertwined in every single memory I had of my life. I don’t remember the first time I brought his existence up to anyone, I was probably very young. My Dad told me they dismissed Mike at first as an imaginary friend, then a bogeyman, then attention seeking behaviour, psychosis, split personality, sleep walking, seizures, I could go on. They didn’t know where I got the name ‘Mike’ from and neither did I since Mike never spoke to me, but somehow I had always known that ‘Mike’ was his name. In the end, my parents tried their best to help but they were as clueless as I was. Mike was some sort of enigma. 

Mike was a white, middle-aged man. I always assumed he was in his late forties or early fifties because the sides of his auburn hair were greying and the top thinning but the wrinkles on his face hadn't quite settled in yet. He wore a dark blue polo shirt, light brown khakis and white trainers; it reminded me of golfing attire. Mike stood around five foot ten or eleven and his frame was lean. He had a clean shaven, softly featured face that I could have imagined being unimposing if he had ever once smiled, but Mike never stopped scowling at me. The only noise he ever made was a shushing sound like I was a petulant child having a tantrum. In all, Mike was seemingly just some random guy who didn’t really exude any kind of energy beyond the generic. Yet, I feared him more than death itself. 

Doctors told me that maybe I met a similar looking man very early on in my life but could no longer remember due to trauma of some kind. But even my parents didn't know who Mike could have been. I scoured endless boxes of family photos kept by all of my relatives, Mike never appeared in any of them. When the internet became widespread and my parents finally caved in and bought me a computer, I spent a good portion of my childhood trying infinite variations of ‘Mike late forties white’ or ‘Michael early fifties golf’ into search engines and social media platforms. I read news articles, trailed through forums, consulted with amateur conspiracy theorists over Skype, if the name ‘Mike’ had ever been used somewhere on the internet then I had checked it a dozen times over. I tried to get evidence of Mike’s existence out there somehow, but he only ever hurt me when we were alone. Trying to record him with any kind of camera was pointless, batteries would die, footage would be erased, or sometimes I could record myself and nothing would happen for hours or days, but he was always right there waiting patiently to be alone with me again. 

It was difficult getting anything done unless someone was present in the room with me. I dropped out of school when I was fifteen. I performed well in classrooms with the other kids, but there would always be a moment where I would find myself walking down an empty corridor. Too many meetings with the headmaster, too many phone calls home to my parents, check-ins from CPS and even the police. I couldn’t concentrate on algebra or Shakespeare with Mike around anyway, so it seemed easier to leave education. I tried working but it turns out nobody really wants to hire a guy who breaks down whenever he’s left alone and constantly shows up each day with fresh injuries.

I went off the rails in my late teens trying to find an answer that made sense to me. At first, I thought substances would help numb the pain that Mike inflicted, but the more I tried to distance myself from him, the worse he became. So then for a while I thought I needed to embrace him somehow, maybe Mike was a messed up karmic entity of some kind, he existed to punish me for doing some sort of perceived wrong to the world. So I started volunteering, local charity shops, animal shelters and the like. I strategically kept my alone time with Mike to a minimum by hovering near anyone I could find, even if it meant I would suffer more when Mike did eventually catch me alone. But I enjoyed what I was doing and I thought I was making some kind of positive impact in the community. After a few months of no change with Mike, I even went as far as boarding a plane with a small peace corp to a poverty stricken village on the other side of the world where I spent months rebuilding everything from shelters to wells to barns. But every night in that foreign country I laid wide awake in my one-man tent trying to muffle my own screams. 

I have to admit, in the last year or so I had taken a pretty heavy dive both mentally and physically. I moved out of my parents place after being on a housing list for quite some time and finally getting lucky. I moved despite my parents extreme hesitancy to let me out of their sight. They were always very protective of me but also in a state of constant worry, I could see the stress of what Mike was doing to me eating away at them. Checking my body regularly for new marks, visits to doctors and hospitals, and never understanding any of it had been their entire life for over two decades. But I had gone from seeing Mike as any kind of moral judge to some sort of curse or demonic being; I had concluded that Mike existed solely to ture me for his own entertainment. I couldn’t keep putting my parents through the curse, or whatever it was, with me, it just wasn’t fair on them. They had loved and supported me my entire life. I knew things with Mike would get much worse if I started living in my own place, but I thought it would be better to suffer alone than drag everyone I loved down with me. I kept thinking maybe one day Mike would go too far, I imagined my parents finding me, never knowing how or why. I just couldn’t do that to them. 

The place I moved in to was on the second floor of a three story block of flats. I figured out pretty quickly, just from observations from my kitchen window which faced the street, that it wasn’t a great area to take a stroll in. There were always loud domestic arguments, drunks, loose dogs and shady dealings going down. It suited my situation perfectly however, because my near constant screaming became nothing more than a backdrop in the chaotic choir of the dysfunctional neighbourhood. 

I never left my flat. I had everything I needed delivered to me so that I wouldn’t need to explain my degrading appearance to strangers or get caught out again in an empty aisle of the local supermarket by Mike just to have a group of concerned customers, employees and security race over to help but ultimately question why I had been screaming like a maniac. It sounds counter-productive to avoid people in my situation, but no one could help me. The more times I tried to explain Mike to anyone, the more times I got carted off to a mental health unit and pumped full of pills. It just seemed completely hopeless to rely on always being around a present witness. There would always be unavoidable moments when we were going to be alone together and Mike was always waiting.

I guess because of the extreme self-isolation and need to connect to people, I started spending a lot of time at the kitchen window, watching the street below like it was a stage for a never ending play that I was the only audience member to. If I focused on what was happening out there in the world, it made it easier to deal with what Mike was doing to me in the confinement of my flat. I spent so much time at the window that I started noticing regulars, people going about the same routines every day, rain or shine. There was an elderly lady who always carted a ratchedy shopping trolley past in the mornings one way, then back again the other way an hour later with the trolley filled with the day's groceries. There were two schoolboys who thought they were being sneaky by smoking behind the dumpsters then emptying a full can of deodorant on their uniforms every week day at four. The local dealer, who I thought might be living in the flat directly below me, sporadically met his clientele by the same dumpsters to exchange goods and banter on sports.

It became quite addictive, watching them all, imagining the lives they were living, lives free of torment, torture and Mike. None of them knew the privilege they carried; blissfully, they were unaware of those like me who never knew a moment of rest. There were moments such as when a happy couple went by, that I would feel bitter and envious. It felt unfair that Mike chose me. I would look out that window at the couple and wish Mike upon them. Sometimes, I would be overcome with guilt and take my wish back, other times I would let it linger, but nothing ever changed. The couple would walk to the end of the street, out of sight, and I would stay with Mike. The flat became my prison, I felt as though I was awaiting my execution. As soon as the warden was done playing with me, he would finish me off but at least then the pain could finally end. It never did though. The days always went on, slowly but surely.

Two months ago however, I killed Mike. It was late in the evening, the neighbourhood was quiet and lights in surrounding buildings were turning off to leave just those on the street illuminating everything. I was at my usual spot by the kitchen window. My head was reeling from a blow so I was only half with it, the throb at the impact point on the back of my skull was throwing me in and out of consciousness. The wailing brought me to, so familiar it took me a moment to realise it wasn’t my own. It grew so loud I couldn’t ignore it. I pulled my head up from the kitchen counter and wiped my eyes clean enough to make out where the noise was coming from. Down below, a young girl no older than four or five was being forcefully dragged down the street by her wrist. I recognised Mike immediately, the same clothes, the same haircut, the same cemented grimace on his face highlighted under every street lamp he dragged the girl past. I looked from the Mike down below, to the Mike standing right beside me. They were both shushing their victims. 

My body, at this point, was a mess. I figured skipping the daily hospital visits would speed up the end. I did what I could with over the counter medications to alleviate old pains a fraction, but there was nothing I could do to medicate against the new pain Mike inflicted everyday. This is to say, I was in no fit shape to grab a kitchen knife from its rack, leave my flat in nothing but my underwear and a blood soaked shirt and stumble down the stairs of my building and out onto the street, all while being pursued by my Mike, in order to confront the other Mike. However, despite my ill health, that is exactly what I did. 

By the time I was outside, Mike had rounded the corner with the girl. I could still hear her screams so I followed them, sprinting as fast as I could on two limp legs attached to a failing body. I imagined I would have looked like a grotesque sight to anyone doing some late night shopping or peeking out their windows. I tried to pull my shirt up over my head with one hand to disguise my deformed face but it was ultimately unnecessary as the area was empty save for Mike pulling that girl along. 

Mike noticed me coming up behind him soon after I rounded my street corner. He and the girl were, by this point, almost at the end of the next street. The girl was kicking at his shin and yanking her arm this way and that to no avail. Mike had stopped walking however and stood there watching me. I still don’t fully understand how I managed to close the distance and bury the knife into his neck, or why he didn’t do much more to react than drop the little girl’s hand. But in that moment, when the knife connected with flesh and the blood, Mike’s blood not mine, started spilling down his polo shirt and onto the pavement, he looked scared of me, truly scared of me. 

The girl ran, unsure of who to be more frightened out of the pair of us I guess, Mike and I. He collapsed uneventfully, the knife still embedded in his neck. Down there on the ground, he opened his mouth as if to speak but no sound save a soft gargling was audible. His body spasmed a few times, we made eye contact briefly, and then he stopped moving altogether.

I looked around and realised that I was completely alone with Mike’s corpse. I wanted to watch him for as long as I could, to make sure he truly remained still. I wanted to stand there and guard Mike’s corpse for the rest of time to make sure he remained a corpse. But a distant car's engine purring to life brought me back to reality. Suddenly, I noticed the cold evening air on my bare legs and the sharp stones embedded in my feet. I heard foxes scuttling about in one direction, birds sending out warning tweets back and forth in another. I smelt metal and wet asphalt. I felt the world beginning to turn with me. I knew I needed to leave, I needed to run away fast and never look back again. So I did.
