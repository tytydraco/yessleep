We moved into apartment 304 on Willow Manor thirty years ago after a messy divorce where my ex husband kicked me and our six year old son out of the house. I had to use up all of my savings so I could pay the deposit to my landlord - he was a man in his seventies. He was an intimidating man, who looked tired of life itself and would only speak a few words when necessary. He was kind enough to let us also move in Bia, our German shepherd, even though the apartment was tiny and had barely any room for my son and I - it was either that or throwing her out to the streets and breaking my son's heart.

   They were best friends. Ever since I gave birth to him she was always by his side, almost like a second mother. Every time my ex would scream at me and break things in his drunken haze Bia would sit guard outside Matt's room. Later, when I would gain enough strength to stand up and go to the bathroom to treat my broken nose Matt and Bia would follow me and just watch. They were both powerless to do anything to help me. We got out of that house after my ex decided that he no longer wanted to waste his money on raising the child he wanted me to keep. I should have been thankful for getting away but now it was my duty be responsible for my small family after years of forced dependency and abuse, I had no clue on where to begin.

   After moving in the little furniture I had managed to get and settling in, it was time to apply for my first ever job. There was a small convenience store below the apartment building and luckily they could afford to hire another cashier, the pay was hardly enough to pay the rent and the necessities but we managed to survive. The first months were peaceful and we were getting used to a quiet home. In the evenings, after walking Matt back home from school, we would sit on the couch and watch TV with Bia laying by the front door. She seemed wary of the apartment from the beginning, almost like she could sense something we couldn't, but I appointed that to her adapting to the new place. When nighttime came Matt and I would sleep together - something we would never do when living with his father - I wanted to make him feel safe before letting him sleep in his own room.

   Some time later our opposite neighbors moved out and we were the only apartment left tenanted on the 3rd floor. The layout was strange, there were 4 apartments in total and we lived between two others with one opposite to ours and the elevator was on the far right of the hallway. It wasn't long until the noises started. I woke up one morning from the sounds of drilling on the wall and I thought that we had new neighbors so I decided to go out and greet them. I opened the door and there was no one there but I could still hear the drilling. I thought the sounds where coming from an apartment above us and didn't pay further attention. From this point on, there would be construction sounds almost every hour of the day to the point of giving me major migraines, therefore I contacted the building manager to ask him if he could tell them work during reasonable hours- nonetheless he said that there is no construction happening in the building right now and that I should be patient until it's done. I didn't want to fight with my upstairs neighbors so I kept my mouth shut.

   A few months later, it was November and Matt's seventh birthday was coming soon. My birthday gift to him was decorating his new room and getting him a small bed with whatever money I managed to save up from my job. He was ecstatic to finally have his own room and not having to share the bed with me which made be a bit sad but I understood that he was getting older and he should start being more independent. While I was setting up his desk I noticed a small hole on the wall that I'd never seen before but I came to the conclusion that since the house was really old and run down it was subject to be damaged here and there. The wall where the hole was, was a party wall between our apartment and the one next to ours, 303. It peaked my interest to look through it and maybe see through next door but the hole was tiny and I could only see darkness.

Matt was never the type to wake me up at night crying but after moving to his room that's what he was doing every night. He was saying that there was a tall, long-bearded man watching him sleep while standing by the door. My ex husband had that exact description so I amounted it to all the trauma he had caused me and my son all those years. Maybe he was afraid that he would return and destroy our lives once again, at least that's what I believed at the time. Between my son waking me up every night and the sounds from upstairs, I could barely get any sleep and I became an agitated mess, my patience was running low and I stopped spending time with Matt - all I would do after work was lock myself inside my room and try to relax.

   As time passed the hole on the wall was getting larger - it started leaking and growing mold. I would clean it every morning but by the next day the spots would be back and I barely had any money left to hire someone to fix it. Matt would refuse to sleep by himself and Bia would never enter the room, she just whimpered at the door. My once calm and quiet dog started running around the house constantly barking at every minor sound she heard and barely ate. She was really old and used to spend most of her time laying on the floor but during this time whenever I took her out on a walk, she did everything she could to keep me from bringing her back home. Eventually they started sleeping with me again, removing any form of privacy I had left in that tiny apartment. Finally I decided to lock the door to Matt's room and ignore whatever was happening inside until I could get someone to check it out.

   We were miserable, I dreaded the moment I would have to return home from work and see my son. He would ask me about that figure all the time, I tried to convince him that it was a fiction of his imagination because I didn't want to believe something else was going on. He was too young to understand that we couldn't leave and I felt horrible that I couldn't do anything. He was scared and paranoid of the house - he reminded me of how he was before we left. All I wanted to do was lay on my bed and not have to deal with any of this but I had to take care of him otherwise I would become like my ex and I hated to do that to Matt. I promised him that our lives would change after moving out and I would finally make him feel happy and protected. My then current situation would not allow that though. I had escaped one nightmare and came to find another, perhaps even worse one. At least previously we had each other to turn to but now it felt like it was me against Matt, I had become the monster and trust me - I tried so hard to prevent it but there was something inside me that had changed, broken. This is how our days would pass, we almost completely stopped interacting with each other and it felt like we were strangers living inside the same house, not a family. Even Bia changed - she didn't want me to pet her anymore and would turn and walk away from me. I hated myself.

The smell coming from the locked room was unbearable, it smelled of decay and dampness. I hung air fresheners everywhere I could to cover up the smell but it did little to help. The towel I put below the door was soaked with dirty water and I was afraid to unlock the room and see its current condition because I knew there was nothing I could do about it. It felt like there was something inside threatening to come out and the door served as a false sense of security, it wasn't there to protect us from it but to keep the illusion of safety. The house was slowly rotting and so were we. It was a prison but it was either that or living on the streets. I was the one responsible to protect my family and that had taken a huge toll on me. Sometimes I felt like a helpless child masking as an adult, I had no one to turn to.

It was about time I did something about our situation and my only option was to ask my landlord to switch apartments. I did not want to spend another day in that house. By the time he visited, the door to the room was almost completely black from the mold infestation and I was terrified to open it after so many months. It felt unnatural to enter the room, it was nearly pitch black from the lack of windows and as the black mold had reached the walls. The smell was so intense you could almost see it in the air. The hole had gotten so large you could pass through it if you crouched. My landlord was furious thinking that we damaged the room and he absolutely did not believe me when I told him the truth. We approached the hole trying to avoid stepping on the dark liquid and the pieces of debris and looked through it, expecting to see through into apartment 303 but all we saw was a broken wall of stacked bricks. The apartment building was initially built in the 1800's and never completely deconstructed as it was considered in a good enough condition to renovate it and let desperate people with little to no money move in. That brick wall had probably been there for decades.

We were nearly fully packed up and ready to move out by the next morning when the renovation crew arrived to clean up the mess. The dark bedroom was filled with people and light - I felt like a huge weight was lifted off of my chest. The crew had disassembled the bricks to clean the source of the mold and behind it they found a small pool of liquid with human remains swimming in it. Someone was literally imprisoned inside the wall built brick by brick until they suffocated. I was horrified to the thought that we were living with a skeleton for so long and I left my own son sleep in the same room with it. I did not want to learn anything more about it, all I wanted to do is leave and never look back. My landlord insisted on us moving into another apartment on another floor for half the price until I found a different place to rent. I decided that we needed a change of scenery, thus after looking through many ads I found a place in a different neighborhood and we moved out of the building as soon as it was possible.

I was glad to leave but the lingering fear of what was revealed stayed with me for many years. Sometimes I walk past my old neighborhood and I still feel the same dread I did the day I looked at the hole for the final time, even though the building has been taken down. Living on Willow Manor seems like a horrible nightmare now and I'm glad that my son was too young to remember anything from it. I've never been completely honest to anyone about what took place there, perhaps out of embarrassment for my inability to protect my family from that horror. Talking about it makes it real and I prefer to remember it as something I never truly experienced.
