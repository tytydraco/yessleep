It was a dark and stormy night, and young Timmy was fast asleep in his bed. Suddenly, he woke up to the sound of scratching on his window. He looked outside and saw a creature he could not recognize with glowing red eyes staring back at him. The **demon** grinned maliciously and beckoned Timmy to come closer.

Timmy was terrified but couldn't move as the demon reached out its long, bony fingers towards him. Suddenly, he felt a surge of courage and decided to fight the demon. He grabbed his baseball bat and charged at the creature with all his might. The demon laughed and disappeared.

*"Am I going insane? I really must slow down with those horror movies."*

As he lay down on his bed, trying to catch some sleep, he heard a faint whisper from the corner of the room. "Don't go to sleep yet," the voice said. Timmy looked around and saw nothing.

Suddenly, the walls started closing in on him, and he felt like he was being suffocated. He tried to scream but no sound came out. The demon appeared before him, grinning from ear to ear. It grabbed Timmy by his throat and lifted him off the ground.

Timmy struggled to break free, but the demon's grip was too strong. It started ripping apart his body limb by limb, tearing out his organs one by one and throwing them back in. The pain was unbearable, and Timmy could feel himself losing consciousness.

His parents found him dead in his room the next morning, torn apart and covered in blood. His vocal cords were completely destroyed - Leaving Timmy with a slow and silent death. They were devastated and couldn't believe what had happened to their son. But little did they know that the demon wasn't finished with them yet.

Timmy's parents would never see him again, and their lives were cut short by the evil creature that had taken over their son's body. It was a place of horror and despair, where no one could find peace or rest. The townspeople avoided Timmy like the *plague*, afraid of what might happen if they crossed its path.

As time passed, little Timmy's decaying body began to show signs of wear and tear.

The demon had been using it *recklessly*, biting everything and everyone so much that his teeth started falling, leaving nothing behind except blood and pain, pushing Timmy's mortal body it to its limits with unnatural and uncaring movements. It had broken many bones, crushed most of Timmy's internal organs, and pushed poor Timmy’s mental health beyond recognition. How did we know he was in there? We often heard something *out of the ordinary* that accompanied gurgles of blood, somewhat resembling "**Sorry**", but it wasreally hard to make it out.

It can't be true! It just can't!

Little Timmy was still alive, deep down... still in there, witnessing the demon's horrible side manifest against everyone who happened to get in his path.

Oh, and how we cried for him. Poor kid...

The demon realized **too late** that it had gone too far in its use of the body. The once-strong limbs of the boy's were now weak and fragile, unable to support the weight of the demon's wrath. The skin was peeling away, revealing the rotting flesh beneath. It was an awful way to die, but the demon didn't care. I noticed Timmy's body really started wearing down.

**In a final act of defiance, the demon used Timmy's body one last time to shred apart one last victim.**

James was his name. James Kelly. He was a father of 2, a very loved husband and a wonderful friend of mine. I remember his screams of sheer pain, panic and terror. I can’t imagine what it must’ve felt like to have your members literally ripped apart by a little boy’s falling teeth, all whilst knowing the ones you loved most are watching you get torn apart.

As the demon leaves little Timmy’s mangled body, I just hear a whimper – A Whimper of Death and Sorrow: “**Sorry**”.
