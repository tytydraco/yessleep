My name is Joey. I’m 24 now and I believe it’s time I share something that's been haunting me for the last 7 years. Things have just gotten to the point I can’t handle it by myself anymore. I need closure. Obviously you read the title in my post here. That I found a journal years ago. Before I get ahead of myself I need to start from the beginning and what's been going on.

I remember when I was a dumb 17 year old kid, long hair and boisterous. I worked at an Arby’s at the time as a manager, this boosted my confidence making a sweet 8.15$ a hour back in 2017. I was also obsessed with the occult and abandoned building hunting. This fit my personality at the time as a rebellious teen making “tons of cash” and the thoughts of being oppressed fresh in my head. However, I still couldn’t afford a car even with “all the money” I had. I was adventurous with my friends nonetheless. One of my closest friends at the time, Austin, was the only one with a car between the 4 of us. Austin, Michael, Ben, and me. We had promised not to talk about it or what we found. With summer coming up and us going into senior territory next year this meant this was the last summer we would enjoy before adulthood. We had to make the most of it this year. I never realized just how memorable those moments would be.

The idea started at one of our classic boy sleepovers. Snacks, video games and the occasional chat about girls or what the Game of the Year will be this time around. Michael was the first to bring up an idea of us going up to a place abandoned he saw while his family was driving through a town up north on the I-15. It has been slightly destroyed with graffiti / outside damage and mostly left abandoned. Michael had said something about it looking like some vagrants had made it their home. Ben, his brother, had confirmed Michaels statements with nothing but a quick smirk and head nod. Vagrants weren’t something we feared as its pretty common place when exploring these places. A quick just looking around usually calmed their minds and they’d leave us alone. Austin usually had a pocket knife or butterfly blade on him, which we found cool at the time but in reality it was probably a way to make him look better for not having a complex personality. He really didn’t need the knife due to the size of him. He was nearly 6 feet tall and a larger guy around 200 something pounds. 

Ben had some words while we were chatting about the location and what to do if there were vagrants around. “I mean, I really don’t know if this is something we can do in a day. Even though it was far away, I'm pretty sure it was a 2 or 3 story building.”

“Stop being a little bitch Ben” Michael said afterward.

“I’m just saying…asshole” Ben retorted.

“Dude’s stop bitching and we’ll figure it out when we get there. It’s like an hour and half away and if we leave after lunch we can have most of the day to check it out and see what we can find!” I said after all their bickering. This was the last thing said before we all solidified the plan. Austin always looked like he had something to say but he never did. Instead we assured him we’d pay for dinner and some gas. The next day was spent preparing and getting ready for August 17th, a Wednesday. We took snacks, chips ahoy and potato chips. Waters and some rope. I was the only one that was agile enough to climb and lift myself over ledges and such. This was another boost in my otherwise confident self. It always meant I was first however. This never failed to make me nervous as I had a light fear of the dark. Though the last things we packed were some sleeping bags and blankets just in case what Ben said was true and we’d have to spend the night there. The rest of that night was us talking and playing games. The next night was our adventure of course.

The morning light hit my face from the floor of Michaels room and my joy was unbreakable. I woke all the guys up like a kid excited for christmas morning. They all rolled out of bed and they all began to get ready and showered while I moved quickly to get things into Austin’s car trunk. After about an hour or two I managed to get everything into the car trunk as the guys barely started to pile in. “Dude you haven’t eaten anything yet, you sure you’re ready to go? Need a protein bar or something?” Austin asked me, giving me a look of concern. Something I knew all too well as he was the dad figure of the group. I remember only nodding as I hopped in the back with Ben. Michael always took the front seat shotgun. We never really know why he needed it so badly, he would fight us if Ben or me ever sat there first. We chalked it up to him just being an idiot. The drive was long and boredom set in quick as we started. We stopped at some random Burger King and got some mediocre nuggets and burgers before we hit our destination a half hour later. This was something even today I still miss having. The monotone lull of calm as we drove miles together as brothers more than friends. Low quality music playing in the background relaxing before a big adventure. Haven’t had another since then.

“Yo guys! We’re here.” Austin shouted from the front in a sort of slightly shaky voice.

“Finally, I’ve been so fucking bored since we left.” Michael said with some eagerness in his voice.

“What do you think is inside? Obviously besides the homeless dudes.” Ben said with a devious smirk on his face. Just poking fun at us seeing if Austin would cringe in fear. To which he winced slightly. Never being a fan of confrontation with them.

After we arrived on the highway I-15 we saw what looked like a broken 3 story home. Some notable graffiti and damage was just as Michael and Ben described. This time around the vagrants weren’t either noticeable or at the residence when we got there. It looked like a mansion in size as we approached from the locked car we left on the highway. Large flowering grasses riddled the land around the home. The Utah mountains in clear view with a small pond to the right of the mansion. The closer we got, the more grand the building was. Intricate designs engraved in the wood of the front porch were whittled away by the wind and elements. As we approached the front porch however, we saw something we never expected. It was clean compared to the rest of it. We were so used to cobwebs and satanic graffiti around the outside like what we saw before. Just some basic looking spray paints names on the outside. “Doctor is in” was one in particular we saw and joked about. Other ones we saw on the way in were “Charley X Marley”, “Cher”, “Mikey”. Again, just names lost to time with their memory forever painted on the side of a building. Of course once inside it was nothing like the outside. The outdoors being broken down and shoddy in appearance.The inside was pristine. As if someone had upkeep on the building inside. Immediately the Mormon in Austin yelled out “Guys are we in somebody's house right now? I think we should leave before someone gets home or calls the cops.”

“Dude, nobody lives here. My dad checked online with the housing association stuff. You know the thing with him selling houses and stuff. Said no one lived here and the water, gas and electric have been shut off for like 100 years or something. History wise my dad said that the last guy to live here was a high class loser. Died in 1930 something. So no, dumbass, no one lives here.” Michael said this with a mean gaze towards Austin almost condescending. “Now let's check out the back. I really wanna see that pond.” He finished telling the group.

What we saw was fairly gross. A couple dead geese in the pool that had rotted long ago. Making the water turn a disgusting brown and green mixture. The pond was covered in large vines and the stench of death. As we approached we saw nothing but groups of rat, geese and cat bones surrounding the area. Scattered around like somebody was throwing them around. Seeing what abomination could be created by doing so.  We only stood there for a small while before coming back inside. Ben and Austin made audible disgust upon coming back in. As soon as our feet touched the floor we heard footsteps run up the stairs. We all jumped only to be calm within seconds. “Probably that homeless dude we saw earlier.” Ben stated as we all began to head up to approach them. We were all silent as we got up to the 2nd floor. Oddly we didn’t find one on the second floor despite the immediate climb after the footsteps were heard.

The second floor felt off. It was blacked out. We quickly flashed our phone lights and found the floor covered in the area we expected. Cans, bags, chalk drawings, trash and spray paints scattered about. The final thing we saw on the second floor I personally found. Something I'd regret in my later years. A simple locked notebook about the size of an average book with damage to its face and back. Having some chain from face to back. Most likely a lock that was lost to time. No writing was found on either side. “Nice! You think we can sell it to the museum or something?” Ben said. The moment he said this it scared me shitless as I wasn’t prepared for sounds to be made.

“Dude! Fuck you. You scared the absolute shit outta me. Austin, Michael, you wanna go see if that guy is upstairs?” I said as I stood there inspecting the book. They simply looked at me and flipped me off in tandem. I put the book away and stuck it inside my ripped jean pocket. We headed up to the 3rd floor but were met with a door. Surprisingly the door was fairly intact. So much so that even the lock worked. “Motherf-ugh. They locked themselves in.” I knocked hard. “Hey asshole, we're not here to take your house. We just wanna explore.” After about 2 minutes of no reply the door unlocked. I ended up opening the door almost immediately “Thanks dude. We don’t wanna intrude. We’re just adventurous. That was really cool of y-” Before I could finish my sentence the room was completely empty. My brothers were just as silent. The room on the 3rd floor was bright due to the hole we saw earlier in the roof portion of the house. By this time it had been somewhere around 5 PM MST. We happened to stop in the middle of the room as Austin whipped out the knife in case someone were to jump out. “Ok dude. If you happened to hide somewhere like the closet please don’t jump out, we don't wanna hurt you or something.” I was almost screaming this but tried to keep my composure with my voice. So my brothers wouldn’t feel scared. I was sure they were.

Austin crept around the closet with Ben and me as we were prepared to jump if someone attacked. He flew the doors open and as we were ready to jump and grab someone we saw a chute instead. We were more terrified of this than if we just found the person inside. Michael came over and threw a rock he took from the pond area and watched as it fell for what seemed like a few minutes. It was more than 3 floors high for sure. Ben walked off at this point and locked the door so no one could get in. Afterward we started to search the room long into the night. After this Ben was the one to find a key. It didn’t fit any locks or anything from the remaining furnishings and dressers. He kept it in his pocket until later.

Reluctantly we knew we had to get back to the car to at least get our stuff or drive off and go to sleep. All of us talked about renting a motel and coming back the next day. Michael, Austin and Ben were of similar mind so we went to a motel 8. The front desk guy couldn’t have been much older than us. He never even checked id’s or anything. That night we all looked inside the notebook. However the first thing we noticed was that it had a note card glued to the 1st page. We carefully tore it off but we did end up ripping a bit off the 1st page. Opening this was probably the first thing that sparked my unhealthy habit of wanting to search the rest of the house. 

“To my love, Dr. Prestine. I can’t feel my legs anymore since the last time we met in your basement. Your love has done so much to improve my life and you send shocks through my body with the way you touch me. I can’t move forward without your love. I know you’re leaving by tomorrow. This is my last letter to you! Please take me with you! I love you and I can’t see you finally leaving this place. After taking care of me for so many years. - Love Evie”

This was something I found amazing! My brothers however, couldn’t give two shits. They fell asleep soon after the reading as we promised each other to see more in the morning. Especially this suspicious basement in the note and the chute. The homeless person we saw sure would leave after the first of daylight. I kept reading all into the night. I could tell Austin was annoyed as we shared the floor of the motel together. The next few pages of the notebook were fantastical and romantic. They ended abruptly. The 1st page we ripped a bit we pieced together early and said something odd to say the least.

“May 19th 1930. Today I purchased this lock and key book to detail my final days. Pneumonia. My father sent over a Doctor to come help me. Father said he met him around the town selling some medicinal herbs from far up north in Oregon. He should be here soon but I don’t believe he can help me. My body is too far gone and everything hurts. The coughing and the blood seem never ending.” The page had already sent me into a heart ache immediately. It could've been the fact that she signed her name and age into the inside of the face. “Evie Jonstan 15” or maybe it was the pain she wrote about. The Page after was a bit afterward but a good read.

“July 2nd 1930. The Doctor has been here for a couple months and the miracle of life has blessed me. In our basement he took me and gave me an elixir that cured me in 2 days. I felt so much better! Only thing I can’t understand is why father makes him watch me overnight. It feels unnecessary now that I'm better. The Doctor must have some love for me. His care is around the clock. The way he stares at me makes my heart skip a beat. I might enjoy the time we have together until its his time to leave.” This entry made me feel odd but understanding of the situation. There's some smaller entries within the first page detailing why she was in the home alone in the first place. “April 13th 1930. Father put me here so I couldn't infect my sister.” These simple lines are usually unnecessary but the first entry sent me. Something sad. I couldn’t imagine being the age I am now, alone. Nothing but the wind as a friend. That would haunt me at night and would be lonely beyond anything I could ever imagine. She must’ve gone through so much pain both emotionally and physically. The 3rd page only brought me in more so.

“January 1st. 1931. You’ve been with me close to 8 months. I’ve been pretending to be sick the whole time. By placing the thermometer under the lamp at night and using salt water as fake sweat. Painting on some paleness for more effects. I’m assured that father would feel so appreciative that you’ve kept me happy. The basement treatments have been more odd but he must love me. He puts me to sleep to get more and more done to fix me! Sometimes I wake up and I hurt. But I would stay doing this everyday just to keep you here to take care of me. If only I could tell you how I feel. The idea of you leaving eventually gives me anxiety and pain.” How could I read this and not feel something drop inside me. It was at this point a fear began taking over as she began to hold him hostage by omission. Staying “sick” to keep someone there, just so you’re not lonely. I still couldn’t blame them as if I were in their shoes I might do the same. This story only got stranger as I realized a few pages were torn out. It was at this point I read one more page and noticed that it was the last in the series. 

“December 25th 1936. Yesterday you took me into the basement for our last time. I;ve been touched by you for the last 6 years. Love has truly touched my heart. I’ll be writing a letter to confess my love. Merry Christmas my love. The basement has been the happiest time of my life. Although the sleeping agent gets longer and longer. I know you must be giving me love so that you don’t hurt me when you leave. I see the marks you leave everytime and I think of them all the time I haven't been able to see for some time. You told me it was the medication but you leave my eyes bandaged. I can’t wait for the surprise you promised me! I can’t feel my legs so it must also be part of the effects. My face I'll bring up to you tomorrow. As it feels odd. Numb? Ever since you took my mirror I've been patiently awaiting the reveal you have ready for me. You must have something huge for our anniversary coming. Perhaps that new nose we’d talked about from before. I’m so excited. I love you so much Dr!” This final entry made me pale. What had this Doctor been doing? It was extremely late by this time. My brothers beside me are completely asleep. I stayed awake that night until they got up to go back to the house. I needed to know what happened. 

The next day my eyes were sunken. I felt my head move on a swivel every everytime we stopped. But the adventurer inside of me had to know about the basement. As we made our way inside the room felt odd. We all felt the hair on our arms stick up. Austin pulled out his knife immediately. Michael, Ben and I looked around the building and after getting to the stairs. We saw a shadow run up to the second floor. We left it alone this time and heard the sliding of a person down a metal slide. It sent a shudder down our spines. Much of this time we spent inside the group had been silent. Scared to death. Not soon after we found the door to the basement. Boarded heavily. We found it and my body felt sick. We all looked at one another and wondered. How this homeless person got up and down the 90 degree slide. Even the thought of them crawling back up made us all want to run. I somehow managed to convince the group we have numbers. Compared to one of them. We started pretty easily tearing it down. The wood had been rotted for some time. I opened the door and a stench of rot flooded our nostrils. 

“I’m gonna fucking puke dude. I’m pretty sure these motherfuckers have been shitting in here.” Austin blurted out unexpectedly. 

“Yeah Joey this is just disgusting I think we should leave before we get too far.” Ben said and honestly I should’ve listened. Because I again convinced them to move forward so we could be done and maybe find the rest of the pages. I also assured them early on before we left  if we got the rest we might make some money from the discovery.

“Look guys lets just find this guy or whatever the fuck animal this could be and just look around for the pages.” It was then something shook me to my core unfortunately. It was heard in the middle of the room underneath a surgeon's table placed crookedly. 

“Give it back…” The voice of an elderly woman echoed through the foul smelling basement. Our flashlights shone through the darkness to reveal jars and vials filled with clotted blood and molds. To our surprise no fecal matter or vomit had been seen. Just clotted moldy blood vials broken and splattered throughout the room. It was then as we shot multiple beams around we saw her. An elderly woman, her face completely disfigured. Her eyes were gone alongside her nose. Her mouth is elongated by slits from each corner from ear to ear held together by loose stitching. Her legs were unsightly. Rotted away. Bones were peeking out from them like they’ve been mistreated and gone for so long. Her arms looked frail but the most disgusting was the two extra appendages attached by the elbow. Moving like they were second nature. From this split second of sight Ben and Michael vomited on the floor and ran.

Austin and I were frozen. Stuck in place and by this time she spoke again in a strange painful rasp “Give it back you fucking filth…” Her breathing became heavy and she began to bleed through the stitching on her mouth. Austin grabbed me hard, So hard I had bruises for weeks. The last thing I remember I threw the journal to her and tried saying her name 

“Evie?” The elderly woman looked at me and through the crinkle of her face showed me nothing but anger. She ran towards Austin and me. He stood in front of me and jabbed at the woman. We ran and only heard screaming from within. He left the knife and never turned back. Soon the screaming stopped once we left. I am sure she had died. Me and my group left at such speeds we eventually got pulled over by an officer on I-15. Austin's first ticket. We left after but I could tell the Officer was intrigued by the ghost white teenagers he had pulled over. He asked if we were ok and was sure he followed us back to Michaels house. Our stomachs and eyes were peeled for the next week. Austin was never the same. He became more outgoing and unhinged. He seemed to leave his innocence behind. I don’t think he’ll ever get over the possibility he killed that woman. Michael and Ben weren’t around enough to know what we did. They still can’t ever look at those abandoned places without feeling violently ill. I, however, went back in 2018. I couldn’t find the body or the blood. She wasn’t inside although I looked and poked around. Ben gave me the key the year prior and I kept it. I checked the basement after I began my extensive search and found not only the now bloodied notebook but a drawer that the key fit.The only page that was found inside was horrific. A lost ending page that I have to share with all of you.

“February 15th 1937. Dr.Prestine you brought me flowers. You told me how much you cared about me. I never got to give you my final note. The smell made me feel free. You’ll never leave me again. Our love was forged by God himself. You still insisted that you would leave. I had kept convincing you to stay since Christmas. You told me you’d be back. I found something in our basement that made me upset. A set of underwear. It wasn’t mine. It hurt me a lot Charles. But you won’t leave me. I felt sad to use the basement on you. I turned the valve off when you were going to put me to sleep again. I think I did well. Without my eyes or legs it made it difficult. I know you were upset with me after you woke up. Soon you calmed down and didn’t say much after. It made me sad to know you sleep so much after my surgery with you. 

March 22nd 1937. I can’t find the town on my own even though I’m off the medication you had for me. I’ve been cleaning while you sleep. I’ve gotten good at hunting. I hear the animals really well. Some are easier than others. The geese that sleep on the pond have been absolutely delicious! Of course for another night you refused to eat! You’re so silly dear. I love you though. You needed a shower for a while. So I gave you one and you were so hard to move. I washed you but you were running through the mud. So much gunk fell off from you. I put you back in the room and we slept together again. You were so much colder than I was. So I knew you needed my warmth. I love you. I’ve been doing so well. I love you so much my husband. Charles you’ve become my whole world. I wish you were more talkative like before when you’d stand at the foot of my bed and tell me how good I made you feel. I love you Charles. 

August 17th 2000. Some robbers came into our dream home. I tried to scare them into leaving but they said they only wanted to explore. I don’t believe them. I kept them running around. They left after searching and tearing our room apart. I was so scared. Charles I knew I had to take care of you. Nothing can separate us. They never checked the bathroom on the second floor where I hid you. The hunting grounds had been disturbed and all of our stuff has been scattered around. I kept this paper and pen in the drawer to write the final days. My heart is becoming tired. Charles It's been so long since you touched me. I’m terrified. The day was spent getting the basement ready for them to come back. Everything was so scrambled and I was so scared. My heart almost couldn’t take it. I will always protect you Charles. 

August 18th 2000. The burglars came back. I think they’re here to steal our valuables. They already took my notebook! Charles I can’t believe it. Those hooligans! They’ve taken so much already without ever giving us a break. Let us go back to our quiet life. Charles I love you and I’ll make sure we're safe. They’ll be sorry if they enter our sanctuary in the basement. I’ll make sure they leave.If I have to kill them to save our livelihood I will. 

This is it. I really hurt charles. They got me. I love yo charles. I lov you charles. I will cleen and get things redy chelys. Cold. I’m coming to bed charles.”

The last segment bothered me the most. After reading it I left immediately and never came back.It ran my blood cold for years.

“I love you sweetheart. Don’t worry about cleaning up Evie. I left this note for the burglars when they made it back. You should’ve seen Evie before my treatments. She was gorgeous. You could never understand our love. If you need to know where the last pages are. Check the restroom on the second floor. Come find us. I know you’ve been curious. I love you too, stranger. Come see us in the second floor bathroom.”

My curiosity was no longer there. I left and no longer went back. The house was clean. The smell of rot reeked heavily from upstairs. A small puddle started to bubble from the ceiling in the kitchen which I passed to get to the basement. I had no questions about what it could be. I had to tell this story. My brothers Michael, Ben and Austin never speak about what happened that day. Nor do I blame them. Ever since I went back I felt something more sad and horrific. These people were delusional. The Dr. and Evie were forever locked in this house. Did their love come from the Doctor's horrible experiments over countless years or Evies tragic ending where she herself took Charles' ability to leave. This was truly a painful thing to see. Yet somehow beautiful. My mind needs to post this for closure reasons. It’s been 6 years. I’m married. Have 2 cats and have a thriving business! Yet this experience took my sleep away for years. The haunting image of this old woman Evie’s body has forever burned into me. I stay awake at night and tell my wife random bullshit excuses. She has no idea that this happened. If she happens to find it she can read it. Before questions I have to apologize. The Notebook was given to the local Lehi museum and after giving it they never gave us money. They probably threw it out by now. The pictures I had on my Iphone have been lost for a long time. I transferred phones years ago and unfortunately never kept the sim card. I had this written out for years just as a draft. I hope you can forgive me. I can only hope you believe me as well.
