It's been about two months since I was forced to move. 

I'd lived at my old apartment complex for about 3 years. Initially I moved there by myself to save money, but by the summer I was able to bring my dog with me. The hold up was mostly due to the landlord being too confusing regarding the pet deposit and I needed to move out of my parents house as soon as possible.

Since his move in, I never had any issues with my boy. He's a chocolate-colored Aussie, somewhere between full and mini, and for this post I'll call him Wiley. The apartment complex didn’t really have a path to walk him so I’d usually take him in a circle around the parking lot area of the complex, then take him outside the gates to walk the surrounding sidewalk. The apartments were in a business lot, surrounded by old government buildings and corporate offices. A lot of the buildings were built around the 80s-90s. A nice perk was the employees of these places cleared out after five, so there was no one around to cause a fuss when I’d take my dog to play fetch on any of the nice manicured lawns of these establishments. 

It was a good routine. On days he didn’t go to doggy daycare he’d get a nice long walk and we’d play fetch. As an Aussie he needed plenty of exercise and loved zooming after the ball when I’d throw it as far as I could. There was a nice field right across from the apartments that ended right up against a government building. Sometimes there’d be an after hours cleaner around, but they never said anything to us. And of course until this summer, we'd never had an issue.

Wiley noticed them before I did.

Barely two months ago, I started having to walk and play with Wiley much later in the day due to the intense heat that comes from it being summer. The sun was setting and we had a nice breeze as we stepped across the road onto the lawn. I threw the ball a couple of times, Wiley did his business, and I’d pick it up and toss it in a nearby bin.

This time however, I threw the ball and went to my phone to change the song I was listening to. I flipped through a couple before settling on something good, and then looked up expecting to see Wiley running the ball back to me. Instead, he was standing under a small tree near the government building at the end of the lawn. The building had these slit windows on the front and back of it, with wider ones on the sides. Wiley was staring at one of those tall windows that sat right beside an emergency exit door. I didn’t think anything of it and called out to him. Wiley stayed still and stared at the window. I sighed and started walking to him.

I really didn’t think much of what was going on until I got closer. This is when I had that feeling. The one where your hair stands up on your arms and the back of your neck gets all tense. Someone was watching me. I put my phone in my pocket and looked all around. Though the sun was almost completely set at this point, I didn’t see anybody else out here. A car drove by to go into the apartment complex, but that was it. All the exterior building lights were on, and so were the street lamps. But that feeling would not go away. I then heard Wiley growl.

I snapped my head around towards him. He had one paw up and was pointing, kind of like a hunting dog does, at the window. His teeth were slightly bared and he growled again. I took some more steps and then flinched.

The window had been darker when I first looked at it. Something had moved inside. Wiley must have seen it but I didn’t notice until it had gone away, as I could now see slightly through the thin window even in the dark. I quickly got Wiley’s attention and we both hurried away from the building. He was very happy to go back inside the apartment gates, but I could tell he was nervous even once we'd made it all the way back home.

We went about two weeks without any problems.

Honestly I’d started to forget about it. I would just take Wiley to another nearby field that didn’t have any buildings close by and played fetch with him there.

One thing to mention, is that If I’m not feeling like getting all the stuff together, I just walk Wiley for two blocks. That weekend I was feeling lazy and did this with him instead of playing fetch. It gets my steps in and he loves trying to smell any scent he can get his nose in. But that Saturday night another weird thing happened.

You see, when I leave my apartment complex through the gates, I can see the government building from that area. I never paid it much mind until that first incident. Nothing was different this time, and I started the walk. During our walk, we had to pass by that government building I'd seen the shadowy figure. I was hesitant to pass it that night. I took Wiley to the other side of the road and kept glancing over. I didn’t see anything but still had that odd sensation I was being watched. I kicked our speed up a notch and made it back to the sidewalk near the complex. Before I went through the gates I looked back at the building. I could see that the emergency fire exit door was propped open. I quickly scanned our fob through the gates and hurried Wiley back to our apartment. I didn’t sleep well that night.

The next occurrence happened over the following weekend. 

I will not lie, I’d been day drinking that Saturday and took my boy out while some friends and myself were taking a break from our gaming binge. I had to throw the ball with Wiley because I didn’t have enough time to walk him.

In a hurry, I took him out to the field across the street. It was still daylight but the heat and sun were thankfully dimming at this point of the day. I played some music and tossed the ball with Wiley who was happy to stretch his legs.

I only had so much time to run Wiley, and he did his business which I picked up after him. After I tossed the bag in the bin, I saw him slowly approaching the fire exit of that building. At this point I was more annoyed than scared and got his attention to come back to me. He did, but kept sheepishly looking back and growling lightly. A habit he picked up from the short time he stayed at my dads house. I got our stuff together and put the leash on him to go back. Wiley kept looking back and growling as I walked him across the lawn.

With a startle, we both heard the fire exit door fly open. I flinched from the noise, and the alarm started sounding out across the lawn. But I kept walking. One, I didn’t want any cops to drive by and think I’d done something, and Two, if something was coming out of the emergency exit of that building, I didn’t want to see it. Even though I was on edge and worried, my instincts told me that nothing had come out of that door.

By the time I crossed the street, the alarm had stopped. I got Wiley through the gate, and that’s when I looked back. I don't think it was my imagination when I say, I could have sworn I saw something in the dark move through the door back inside the building. And it definitely was not my imagination when I saw the door close shut. I remember that is when I finally took another breath.

These incidents led to more, and eventually to me moving out of the apartment complex in general. I'll post them here when I get my thoughts straight, but its been a hectic past couple of months. You never really know what to make of these situations, but writing it down and letting others hear about it honestly sounded helpful for me. I'll try to update everyone soon enough.
