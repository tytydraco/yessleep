When I was a child, my mother would let me do almost whatever I wanted. Sleep over at any friend's house, go to any part of town, have as many pets as I wanted. She never stressed about any of that. 

She only had one rule for me. Never, ever, go into the field after dark. 

We lived in a farmhouse, where my dad and grandpa grew corn. It was a modest wooden building at the very edge of town, with acres of golden stalks stretching out to meet the horizon. It was a peaceful childhood. My only close friends were my grandpa and my dog, Tucker - a border collie with more intelligence and personality than most people. We would spend hours wandering the farm and going on adventures. He never made any fuss, always quiet as a mouse. 

I grew up with stories about him. The Straw Prince. When I was a toddler, my mother would dust off an old, leather bound book and read it to me. 

He lived in the fields, among the swaying stalks and yellowed leaves, watching over us in the dark hours of the night. Under the cold glow of the moon, in silence so deep not even the wind would dare disturb it, he would wake from his rest - stitched from crows feathers and corn husks, adorned with a crown of twine.

I don’t have the book anymore, so I can't share the pictures that came with it. But I’ll never forget the words:

When the sun is high and the sky is bright,
The field is full of golden light.
You may run and skip and play,
Among the corn by light of day.
But when the sky turns dark and deep,
And stars like silver lanterns peep,
You mustn’t stray beyond the gate,
For that’s the time to watch... and wait.
The Straw Prince holds his nighttime ball,                                                                                           With rustling guests both great and small.                                                                                They twirl and glide through moonlit shade,                                                                                      In steps and patterns never swayed.
But our feet must never prance
Among the rows where shadows dance.
So close the gate and softly keep
To house and hearth, and drift to sleep.
At the time, I thought it was just a pretty rhyme. I liked the idea of secret dancers in the field. I didn’t understand that it was a warning.

He had his world, and we had ours. The night was his, the fields were his. He allowed us to harvest as long as we respected his domain. That mutual respect between us was never to be broken.

Tucker was a good dog. He never barked without reason, never chased after stray cats or birds like other dogs did. I trusted him completely.

But one summer, everything changed.

During our time outside together, Tucker acted differently. He would stand towards the fields with resolute eyes, growling and bristling. And it wasn’t just him. The farm itself felt different - I felt different. The sensation of being watched never left me, not until I went inside for the day. 

There were new noises, too. Unnatural, almost mechanical clicking - so quiet it was barely audible. But I did hear it, from the shallow reaches of the corn stalks, just barely out of sight. A thin curtain separating me from… something. 

I remember how they would follow Tucker and me as we moved along the edges of the property. Each step we took was answered by rustling stalks moving with us.

I spent less and less time outside. When I told my mother, she went pale and screamed at me. She forbade me from playing outside without her supervision. 

She didn’t give me a reason why but she didn’t have to. I knew who was looking. 

It was late August, a few weeks after my tenth birthday. The days were still hot, but the nights had begun to cool, and the corn stood tall and thick. The house creaked in the breeze, the fields swayed beneath a crescent moon.

I had just gone to bed when I heard it - rustling in the fields. Tucker had been keeping his post on our front porch - watching over us during the night. I heard him stand, growl, and then bark. Low, angry noises I hadn’t ever heard him make before. Then I heard him dart off towards the fields.

I ran to the window. The yard was empty. The barking was coming from the field now.

By the time I reached the porch, the barking had grown fainter, swallowed by the corn. I called his name, over and over. No answer.

I knew the rule. I knew it better than any other. But I wouldn’t let anything happen to Tucker. All I could think of was him out there in the fields. Lost, alone and afraid in the dark.

So I broke the rule. I opened the gate and stepped into the fields. 

I ran toward where I’d last heard Tucker. The leaves scraped at my arms and legs, like cilia straining to push out a foreign object - trying to spit me out. I wasn’t welcome here, not now.

I stumbled into a small clearing where the corn thinned, and the sensation of eyes on me reached its peak. 

Tucker lay there, motionless save the rising and falling of his ribs. One of his legs bent at an unnatural angle. I ran to him, struggling to lift him into my arms, then slinging him across my shoulders.. He let out a pained whine, but all that mattered to me now was that both of us needed to leave immediately. 

A primal instinct inside of me screamed that we were not alone. 

Rustling from behind me, then footsteps. I braced as the corn stalks were separated - pushed aside by a being far bigger than myself. 

I was preparing to meet the fairy tale, the Prince whose law I had broken. Yet the face of husks and feathers is not the one that greeted me. 

Instead, a man emerged from the stalks. A short, scraggly beard, tangled hair, clothes crusted with dirt. A lanyard hung around his neck; at its end, a camera swung with each step, clicking faintly against his chest. He held a stone in his hand. But what frightened me more than anything were his eyes. Once blue, now faded with a sallow tint. And in them burned a hunger I had never seen before. He looked at me like a hyena looks at a crippled calf. 

Tucker whimpered at the sight of him, jolting me back from my fear-stricken daze. I ran back the way I had come. The stone flew by my head as I went, just barely missing me. Then, the sound of my footsteps was mimicked by another pair of steps. Longer strides, faster pace. The man was getting closer, and I was still so far from home. 

A hand clamped around my arm, yanking me to a stop. The man held me in place. I twisted and kicked, clawing at his grip, but he was too strong. I could smell his clothes - old and stained with sweat and grime. He chuckled darkly and began to pull me back deeper into the corn. I screamed - but I was too far away to wake my sleeping family. 

Then, a shift. The rustling around us stopped, replaced by a thick, unnatural silence. The air seemed to tighten. A confused grunt, followed by falling. Not me, but my captor. His legs were pulled out backwards from under him. He fell on his chin with a loud thud. I saw him attempt to stand up again. Even now I could see I was his target. Before he could rise to his feet again, he was pulled deeper into the heart of the field. I heard him scream as he went - dragged farther and farther into the corn.

I took the opportunity and ran home, Tucker still slung over my shoulders. Just as before, the corn impeded my path and slowed me down. The distant screaming stopped suddenly, but I didn’t take the time to stop. 

The trip back was slower and more painful than earlier, and by the end of it I was littered in scrapes and cuts. But I got Tucker and me home. 

I was planning on waking my family, of course. But before I entered the house I took one last glance back into the fields - and I saw him. I saw all of them.

Beings of shadow, of straw and feathers, of leaves dried to brittle husks and twine wound tight. They danced in the field, under the glow of the moon. It was beautiful, but terrifying. Their limbs were stiff, yet somehow they moved with a fluid grace.  I stood frozen, heart hammering, unable to look away. Some part of me knew - this was not a sight meant for human eyes. Among them, I recognized two.

The first was a tall figure made of corn and crows feathers. Around his head was a wreath of twine. There was a regal and powerful air to him. He moved with authority. 

The second was a large man with filthy clothes and scraggly hair. His limbs had stiffened and swollen with straw, stuffing jutting from the tears in his sleeves and collar. His once yellowed eyes were gone, replaced by twigs and leaves. His camera swayed as he joined the Prince’s ball, as he would every night from now on.

So close the gate and softly keep to house and hearth, and drift to sleep.

I never forgot those words again.
