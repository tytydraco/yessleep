Redhaven Hollow doesn’t end. Not the way other towns do, with clean borders and exit signs. The hills close in too tight, the trees grow too thick, and the roads—all of them—curl back toward the square like veins to a heart.

I shouldn’t have stayed, but my car had other ideas. It died three miles out, stranding me where Redhaven’s spindly arms could reach me. Reina Morales gave me a room above her bakery without asking too many questions. She wasn’t the kind of person who needed answers, anyway. Her eyes were sharp enough to slice meat clean off the bone.

“You’re just in time,” she said when I thanked her. She didn’t explain for what, but her hand lingered just a second too long on the counter, fingers twitching, like there was something she didn’t want to say out loud.

The room wasn’t much. The wallpaper curled at the edges, the windows sweated on cold nights, and the smell of yeast soaked into everything. It was the kind of space that felt temporary, but Reina’s silence made it clear I wouldn’t be leaving it as quickly as I thought. Every morning, there were notices on the bakery doors—thick paper emblazoned with an hourglass and a date: April 1st.

“What’s with the hourglass?” I asked her once.

She pressed her fingers into a lump of dough with more force than necessary. “Election Day,” she said, voice low. “You’ll see.”

The morning of April 1st came wrapped in mist, bells tolling somewhere deep, like they were calling from underground. The square was already full by the time I got there. Families crowded together, shoulders pressed tight, faces pale beneath the banners flapping overhead. The hourglass was everywhere—stitched into sashes, inked onto arms, painted in strokes of black and red that made my stomach churn.

The mayor, Elias Trejo, stepped onto the stage. He wasn’t a big man, but he had the kind of presence that made people step back anyway. His voice cut through the crowd like a blade. “Today, Redhaven Hollow honors the tradition that keeps us whole,” he said. “The vote will decide our leader. As it always has.”

The box they brought out didn’t look ceremonial. It looked ancient—dark wood patched with iron bands that were warped and rusted. Its surface was cracked and scorched, as if it had been pulled from the kind of fire you don’t walk away from. Trejo opened the lid, revealing slips of paper folded tight.

“You draw,” he said. “The hourglass chooses.”

The rules were unspoken but understood. Step forward, reach into the box, and draw your slip. If the hourglass stared back at you in red ink, you were chosen. There were no speeches. No questions. Just the sound of paper unfolding and the sharp breaths that followed.

When my turn came, Reina shoved me forward. Her hand lingered for half a second on my arm. “Don’t look at anyone,” she muttered. “Just draw.”

The paper felt damp, like it had been pulled from water. I unfolded it slowly, the crimson hourglass staring back at me with lines that seemed to ripple. The cheers erupted before my brain could process what I’d drawn, but it wasn’t the kind of applause that lifted you. It felt more like dirt piling on a coffin.

Trejo beckoned me up. “Congratulations, Mr. Montes,” he said, his smile thin and brittle. “You’ve been chosen.”

They draped the sash over my shoulders, the embroidered hourglass heavy as a chain. The thread itched against my skin, and I felt the eyes of the crowd pressing against me, too many emotions to decipher. I thought maybe they looked relieved, but it was the kind of relief you feel when a storm spares your house and takes your neighbor’s instead.

Trejo led me to the courthouse. Inside, the air was damp and thick, the walls streaked with shadows that didn’t belong. He handed me a leather-bound ledger, its cover cracked, its pages curling. “You don’t govern,” he said, his voice cold. “You judge.”

The names inside were written in ink so dark it looked wet. Beside each: a crime. Dissent. Disruption. Dishonor. And beside the crimes: punishments. Exile. Confinement. Cleansing. I didn’t ask about the last one. Trejo didn’t explain.

The first case came the next day—a boy accused of spitting on the hourglass. He couldn’t have been more than twelve. His shoulders shook, but his chin stayed high, and his eyes—when they met mine—didn’t waver. When I hesitated, Trejo stepped closer, his shadow crawling up my arm.

“The Hollow demands decisions,” he said. “The hourglass doesn’t wait.”

I sentenced the boy to confinement. The courthouse doors slammed shut behind him, the lock echoing like thunder in the square. His mother screamed as they dragged him away, but the crowd cheered. The sound scraped against my skull.

The weeks blurred. The sash grew heavier with every judgment, the hourglass stitching biting into my chest like teeth. I stopped sleeping. Whispers coiled through my room at night, voices that spoke without words. I saw shadows where there shouldn’t have been shadows, and when I walked through the square, I swear the hourglasses on the banners followed me.

April 1st came again, and the box returned. My name was still inside. I stood there as the bells tolled and the mist curled through the streets, knowing there would be no escape. Redhaven Hollow doesn’t forgive. The hourglass only keeps turning, its sand running in a cycle that never ends.

When I drew the slip, my fingers trembling, I didn’t pray for salvation. The crimson ink bloomed like blood beneath my thumb. I looked at it and knew it would never wash away.

The whispers rose around me, soft as breath, close as hands. No one escapes the hourglass.

And I felt it then—the weight, the stain, the unshakable truth that Redhaven Hollow had marked me. Forever.
