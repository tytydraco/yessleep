It finally reached my doorstep. This new scheme started by the government to control earth’s population. There’s too many of us on this planet. Some of us need to go. Natural selection won’t decide which of us will survive. The government is basing it on _luck._ 

I was tossing and turning in my bed last night when someone banged on my door. I looked through the peephole—the gunned men were covered in masks, adorning their military attires.  A fist came bearing down again, jolting my observations. I opened the door for them, scared but not surprised. 

They repeated the same routine for every flat on my floor. A family of four shuffled outside, then a girl a decade younger than me and a retired salaryman. The dog stayed inside, barking. My cat was still on the couch. 

One of gunned men approached the elderly man. He was handed a bright green crocodile toy—I remember playing the game with my friends when I was young. The teeth of the crocodile had to be pressed in turns, one of them triggering the crocodile to snap its jaw and declare a loser. When I was six, the loser got a penalty—something inane, like a splash of water or a pinch on the arm.

Now, the loser would lose their life. 

The elderly man closed his eyes and pushed one tooth in. Nothing happened. 

The father from the family went next. Gulping and sweating, he held the crocodile in his hands and after moment of reluctance, he pressed. 

Things remained unchanged. 

He was safe. 

I went next. My whole body trembled as I was given the toy. Life or death, decided by a game of chance. I wondered if the shinigami watching over me knew whether I would die tonight or not. 

I sunk a tooth in. 

I was spared. 

The girl went after me. She cried and wailed and made efforts to escape. One of the men hit her with the back end of his gun. Blood seeping down her forehead, she quietened and played the game. The crocodile’s beady eyes stared at us all as its jaw stayed open. 

The twins from the family went one after the other. They said a prayer under their breaths, teary gazes, clammy hands. 

The crocodile showed mercy to both of them. 

The toy was then passed between us for another three rounds, each one more harrowing than the last. 

Finally, six teeth remained unpressed. 

The girl clicked a tooth and collapsed to the floor. 

She would live. 

Hugging her knees, she sobbed as we continued to play. 

The elderly man played and was also spared.

The girl kept sobbing. 
 
He passed the toy onto the mother. She got lucky and so did her husand. They both began crying in earnest, but not out of relief. 

The girl still kept sobbing. 

Two turns remained and three players. Me and their two children.  

I would go only once before the round was finished. 

You know how things ended. You know who lost. 

The girl did not stop sobbing. 

The gunned men did not use guns but poison. 

The burial had two caskets.
