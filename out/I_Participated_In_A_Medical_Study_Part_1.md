I recently fell on hard times—what with the economy being a heaping pile of hot trash. After getting laid off, I needed money fast, so I signed up for a medical study. It was simple enough: they were testing a new drug meant to help with anxiety and depression. Some kind of one-use SSRI. The payout was decent, and all I had to do was show up, take a shot, and report any side effects.

Easy money.

The clinic was unassuming—a plain white building with frosted glass windows that blurred the inside like warped skin. The air inside was thick with the sterile tang of antiseptic, but beneath it lurked something else. Something stale. Organic. Like meat left to rot in a sealed room.

A nurse greeted me with a clipboard. She had the kind of expression that was meant to be reassuring, but her smile was wrong—stretched too thin, like skin over too many teeth. She asked me a few questions, then led me down a too-bright hallway to a sterile little room, where a doctor administered the shot.

It barely hurt.

Dr. Weiss—according to his badge—offered a polite, rehearsed smile as he disposed of the needle.

“You may feel some mild disorientation at first,” he said, scribbling something on my chart. “Nothing unusual. Just try to relax and let it pass.”

I nodded, signed the necessary forms, and left.

I expected side effects. A headache, maybe. Some nausea.

I did not expect reality to break.

At first, it was subtle. My hands felt distant, as though I was controlling them from the far end of a tunnel. Then, my vision warped—like looking through dirty glass, the world dimming at the edges.

By the time I reached the bus stop, I wasn’t sure if I was inside my body anymore.

My thoughts stretched, slow and cavernous, echoing in a space far too large for me. I could still see, still hear, but everything came a second too late—like I was experiencing life after it had already happened.

Then, I was falling.

Not physically—no one reacted, no one even looked at me—but mentally, I was plummeting into an endless abyss. My limbs unraveled like pulled threads, my body stretching outward into nothing. I was dissolving. Vanishing. I was—

Pain.

I hit the concrete face-first.

The impact rattled my skull, sharp and immediate, yanking me back into my body like a hook through my spine. My teeth had split my lip; I could taste blood, warm and metallic, pooling in my mouth.

And then—

I slipped again.

I didn’t stand up. My body did.

It wiped the blood from my chin. Rolled my shoulders. Tested my fingers like a pianist stretching before a performance.

I was still in there—somewhere. Watching. Screaming. But I had no mouth.

I was a passenger.

I don’t remember getting home.

One moment, I was staring at the pavement. The next, my body was unlocking my front door.

I wanted to stop. I wanted to scream. To throw myself to the ground, fight against the invisible force moving my limbs like a marionette.

But I couldn’t.

My body moved with eerie, hollow precision—fluid yet mechanical, like something had studied how humans walked but didn’t quite get it right. It locked the door. Stepped inside.

Then, it did nothing.

For hours, my body stood in the middle of the living room, staring at the wall. Unmoving. Unblinking. The silence was suffocating.

Then, it chuckled.

Low. Breathless. My own voice, but wrong. Warped at the edges, like it was coming from inside a broken radio.

My stomach twisted.

Then, for the first time, it spoke.

“Hello, I’d like to schedule another appointment.”

The words slithered from my lips like something foreign, something wet.

The receptionist answered.

“Yes, the same procedure. As soon as possible.”

I tried to fight. I pushed against the walls of my own mind, but it was like shoving against solid rock.

No movement. No control.

The voice on the phone confirmed the appointment. My body nodded. My mouth—but not my voice—thanked them and hung up.

I was going back.

And then—

The skips began.


---

Blink.

Morning.

My body stood in the mirror, studying its own reflection with empty, unseeing eyes.

Blink.

Night.

I sat at the kitchen table, carving symbols into the wood with a knife I had never owned. The patterns twisted and curled, familiar in a way I couldn’t place. They hurt to look at.

Blink.

Outside. Rain slashed against my skin. In the distance, something moved in the trees—its voice low and wrong, whispering my name.

Blink.

The bedroom. My body—the thing inside my skin—was humming softly. The tune was familiar. A lullaby.

One my mother used to sing.

I wanted to vomit.

I was losing time.

Losing myself.

And worst of all—

It was getting stronger.
