Yes, I saw it.  But it’s not what I saw, or the damage it did to my body three years ago that still wakes me up in the middle of the night screaming.  It’s the dread of knowing that it’s still out there, feeding, that haunts me.  I knew almost immediately that my first search and rescue mission in the United States Coast Guard was going to be my last.  The most razor sharp moment of clarity and fear I’ll ever have in my life is when I realized monsters are real. 

I was an Aviation Survival Technician, fresh out of graduating from the Navy Diving and Salvage Center in Panama City.  Like I said, it was only three summers ago, so I was twenty three when I got stationed at Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii.  Our base had two rescue choppers - an MH-65 Dolphin, and a MH-60 Jayhawk.  Petty Officer Gaffen was the rescue diver for the Jayhawk, and I replaced a retired rescue diver for the Dolphin crew.  The first time I met Gaffen, he looked like a text book hero with his broad shoulders and square jaw.  The last time I saw him, he was purple and bloated under his black suit.  His whole body was an inflated version of his normal self.  Rips were forming along the sides of his suit, which meant his organs and skin also had to be expanding and tearing apart.  His square jaw turned oval as he screamed beneath the water in a shroud of blood red bubbles.   

I had been stationed there for almost a month with no activity when the massive storm hit the Hawaiian islands with heavy rain and massive waves.  The first emergency distress call we got was for a yacht that got caught trying to beat the storm back to the mainland.  Gaffen took the first call and flew out with his team in the Jayhawk.  

An hour later, it was the Dolphin’s crew turn to shine in the face of dark thunderous skies and roaring seas as the Aircraft Commander, Co-Pilot, Flight Mechanic and myself heeded a distress call from an overturned fishing vessel off the coast of Kauai.  It was a bumpy ride flying twenty minutes to the last reported S.O.S. position of the two-man crew.  Visibility was extremely limited as we scanned the chaotic waves for the survivors or signs of wreckage.  

“I see them,”  I said into my headset while pointing at the overturned hull of the boat with the two fishermen clinging to the stern ladder.  “Starboard side.  Five o’clock.”

The Commander adjusted our course as I kept my hand fixed at the area I saw the fishermen last.   The roaring waves constantly blotted them out, giving me only a fraction of a second at a time to track their position so the Commander could follow my hand until we hovered within range for a drop. 

“Wind velocity is too severe and the waves are too high to dip any lower,” said the Commander.  

“Copy that,” I responded, knowing that meant I had to drop first, then they’ll lower the rescue cage down.  I was wearing a dry suit, which keeps you warmer than a wet suit, and quickly slid a pair of fins on my feet.  I turned on the oxygen tank and donned my mask.  Then I stepped out onto the skid and positioned myself for freefall.  A typical dive height during a rescue would be from around fifteen feet or so.  But, in extreme weather conditions, jump heights can fluctuate.  I was functioning on adrenaline and my training as I gave the thumbs up before letting myself drop over the edge, some forty feet above the lowest sea level.

My legs were together, aimed straight downward as I fell with my arms at my sides and my head facing forward.  I looked down by tilting my eyes while keeping my head straight, hoping to spot the fisherman close to my drop zone.  What I saw was a mass of movement just beneath the surface.  It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing with the wind and rain and waves crashing below while I fell through the air like a projectile.  When my mind accepted what I was seeing, I lost my breath.  An oxygen tank was feeding me oxygen and I still lost my breath.

It looked like an island moving just beneath the surface, covered with green seaweed everywhere except in its center.  That’s where its eye was.  Large as an above-ground pool, pitch black in the center of a yellowish lense; the giant eye rolled in my direction.  It saw me falling from above.  

Terrified out of my mind, I screamed inside my breathing apparatus at the realization that monsters exist, and I was about to literally drop on top of one.  A wave smacked me across my body as it passed through me, but I still had another ten feet to fall.  I could see the beast’s green body, as long and wide as a soccer field, pass beneath me with its large eye moving forward again.  At the rear of the goliath, the green texture turned into a greyish super-fin, larger than that of any whale you’ll find in the record books.  The texture of the massive fin was a hard, solid exterior, like leather.  I know because I landed on top of the fin, shattering bones from my hips to my feet as my legs folded beneath me upon impact.  

Pain can be an overwhelming experience, powerful enough to knock a person out cold or revive a person that was out cold.  I was very much awake and alert while my broken body rolled over the last of the sea beast’s enormous tailfin as it swam on, leaving me to float in agony.  

I could see the Dolphin struggling above me to stay in position as they lowered the rescue basket.  Looking forward, I could see through the waves that both fishermen still clung to the rear ladder.  They were wearing orange life vests as they bobbed up and down with the boat as the waves rocked them about.  Even with the immense pain in my legs and the rough weather, I could see that they were trying to climb up onto the upside down vessel in desperate fear of what lurked beneath them.  Waves kept blocking my view, but I could see what happened to them in intervals.  

The green seaweed I mentioned that covered most of the beast rose out of the water like tentacles and wrapped around the fisherman.  The two men tried to free themselves from the slithery appendages, getting more frantic as their bodies began to swell up in size, as if some kind of toxin secreted from those tentacles, poisoning and swelling its victims into paralytic states.   And just as horrifying, I must say, was the fact that I didn’t see one single seaweed appendage wrap around the boat ladder.  Not one.  That’s a sign of intelligence. Knowing what can and can’t be digested.  Not that I saw a mouth.  I only have a theory as I watched those poor men nearly explode before they were pulled beneath the surface of the water.  Another bout of waves blocked my view, but when I could see again, the fishermen were gone.  The overturned vessel became a floating tombstone for the men that I believe were pulled all the way down to the surface of the monster, where they were slowly digested, like flies in a fly trap.  That’s why no one has ever found their bodies.  And not just theirs.  That’s what should have happened to mine.  I knew that the monster was turning around to finish me off next.  Despite the pain and cold water, the idea that what I just saw happen to them is about to happen to me was all my mind could handle and I finally, blissfully, passed out. 

I woke up some time later to see my saviour, Petty Officer Gaffen, finish strapping me into his rescue basket.  Above me was his chopper, the Jayhawk, ready to hoist me up as soon as he attached himself and gave the thumbs up.  I didn’t know at that time that the Dolphin had been forced to abandon me, aborting the mission when our chopper sustained propulsion failures within seconds of my drop.  They had to leave me, but knew that backup was on the way as the Jayhawk crew finished their mission and was already enroute to assist us.  All I knew was that I was so glad to see my friend in my darkest hour.   

“Hey partner,” he said after removing his mouthpiece, “ready to go back to base?”

I nodded and smiled at the hero floating upright beside me as I lay strapped to the basket. 

Gaffen smiled back.  Then his face distorted.  I could tell he was unsure of what was happening for a couple seconds, and then it was obvious that he felt pain.  His face turned reddish, then purple as it swelled up quickly.  Then I saw them.  The seaweed tentacles slithered up from around his chest and shoulders.  The last thing he did was give the thumbs up so they could hoist me out of the water.  I’m sure his crew thought he was strapped with me when they raised the cage.  While I went up, Gaffen was pulled down, expanding and drowning at the same time.  

I saw several of its tentacles reaching up for me.  Beneath the water I saw that great and terrible eye blink once as it fixated on me.  It watched me until I was pulled safely into the Jayhawk.  The crew was in a panic because no one could spot Gaffen in the water.  Not one of them, nor had any of my crew members seen the sea monster that stole three lives that night.  I was discharged with the shame of being falsely blamed for an improper water landing and failure to save two fishermen, plus the stigmata of being the reason Petty Officer Gaffen died.  No one believed my story.

Until now.  I know why you’re asking me these questions.  You’ve noticed the same thing that I’ve been keeping track of - Reports of people going missing during walks along the beaches and people vanishing while swimming in shallow waters.  Local news outlets from California to New Jersey have cited police reports and eye witnesses claiming people in the water commented about strange seaweed before being pulled down and disappearing in popular swimming locations.  Traces of blood and bodily fluids are found in many cases, but not any bodies.  Not a single one.  Which is where my theory comes from; that the large mammals wrap their victims up close to their bodies and slowly digests their prey through secretions.  

Yes, I think there’s more than one of them out there, floating beneath people under the guise of massive sections of seafloor, covered with strong and venomous tentacles disguised as seaweed.  I think there could be many of these colossal predators that once dominated the seabed that are now feasting in shallow hunting grounds that we call popular vacation spots. 

There is one recent report of twenty three people gone missing at a popular beach off the Florida coast.  The family members that were on the beach at the time claimed that everyone in the water was having fun when suddenly they all screamed out at once before being violently yanked under the water.  None of them resurfaced.  Twenty three people having a good time and then Whoosh, without warning, gone without a trace, right in front of nearly a hundred witnesses on land.  The incident is under investigation but I know that the killer is a flat-shaped marine carnivore the size of a small island.  Maybe the same one that killed my friend, Gaffen, and crippled me for life.  That’s why I’m sharing my story, in an effort to warn you all.  

Look closer at the reef the next time you are swimming or diving in the ocean.  If you think you see a strange formation in the rock, sand and coral that resembles a giant eye, keep watching to see if it blinks.  Then again, if you’re in the water and see a giant eye blink amongst the coral beneath you, it’s probably already too late for you to do anything but scream.
