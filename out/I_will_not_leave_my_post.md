I will not leave my post,

Not if I hear it.

Not if I see.

I will not leave my post.



I will not leave my post,

Others have fled before.

Now they are here no more.

I will not leave my post.



I will not leave my post,

Only I remain.

Even if I dont wake again.

I will not leave my post.

We have spent three days on this hill—cut off, our rations dwindling, guarding… something. Something that looms among us like a nameless shadow, a vortex of the forbidden whose nature the Empire has denied us the right to know. We do not know what it is. We do not know why we are here.

But we do know one thing, we cannot leave it.

The Colonel knows. He has said so. But his gaze, the way his lips tighten and his voice withers in his throat, tells us that there are things that must not be spoken. Some silences are more terrifying than words.

The wind drifts northward, carrying a metallic stench. The sun sinks behind the hill, swallowed by a horizon that seems to fold in on itself. Night falls, and we, exhausted and starving, remain. Four more days until the next squadron arrives.

Romulus tries to lift our spirits with a story. His voice wavers in the dim light as he speaks of a tiger and a blind man, deep in the jungles of India. The blind man, unaware of the beast’s power, dares to speak of humanity’s supremacy, of its intellect, its strength, its dominion over all things.

The tiger does not answer. It has no need for words.

It leaps upon him and tears him apart in an instant.

Romulus falls silent. I do not know what he hoped to accomplish with that tale. But the silence that follows is heavier than hunger, thicker than the mist creeping in from the slopes.

We send him to cook dinner.  


Later, the Colonel and I share watch. He sits with his rifle resting on his knees, his eyes lost in the darkness.

"Were you in the war?" he asks without turning.

"We’ve all been in one, in some way or another," I reply.

"It’s not the same."

"No, it isn’t."

The silence between us is dense. Then, without quite knowing why, I speak.

"I had a captain," I say. "During the first campaign in Europe. They say he died standing, rifle in hand, with a mountain of bodies at his feet."

The Colonel turns and looks at me for the first time that night.

"We all have a hero," he says. "Until it’s our turn to be one."

I do not answer immediately. The night remains still, the wind barely daring to stir the grass. Then, I return the question.

"And you?"

The Colonel takes his time to reply. His gaze drifts into some buried memory.

"I had a sergeant," he murmurs. "He wasn’t the strongest, nor the fastest, but he was always there. He held out until the last shot, until everything fell silent."

He pauses. Barely a whisper:

"Sometimes I wonder if he saw it coming. If he knew before the rest of us."

I do not answer. There is nothing to say.  


Night deepens, and sleep takes me.

And then, I dream

A door, swelling as something pushes from the other side. The hinges groan.

Something is opening it.

I cannot see who.

I know that if it opens, something terrible will happen.

But it does.

The world collapses. A building crumbles as if the ground beneath it has turned to nothing.

No screams.

Only the echo of destruction.

Then, I see myself.

Not as one sees their reflection in a mirror, but from above. From all angles at once.

Something drags me. A shadow of liquid malevolence.

I try to resist. It is useless.

It tears me apart.

But what truly horrifies me is not the pain.

It is the smell.

Thick. Rotten. Clawing at my throat like decayed flesh beneath an unrelenting sun.  


I wake up, gasping in that stench.

But the reek lingers.

The Colonel shakes my shoulder. His expression is hard, inscrutable.

"Your turn," he says.

The foulness still clings to my throat. Gods, if only it were just a dream.

"You know the protocol. Don’t look at it directly. Just keep watch."

Watch for what, exactly, he has never told us.

Watch that it does not change.

That no one touches it.

That nothing touches it from within.

At first, all is still. The morning air is cold, metal faintly ticking as it expands with the temperature.

Nothing more.

But soon, the visions begin.

The ground shifts. Darkens. Turns damp, an open wound in the earth.

The grass shrinks back, each blade twisting into a skeletal finger, clawing at the air.

I blink.

The vision vanishes.

Nothing has happened.

Yet.



Romulus wakes. It is my turn to sleep, but before I lie down, I watch him.

His skin is paler than yesterday. His eyes—dark, sunken—meet mine with an unreadable expression.

"Are you alright?" I ask, voice low.

Romulus takes a long moment to respond. His voice drifts, carried by the wind.

"Yes. Everything is fine."

But as I walk away, a whisper barely escapes his lips:

"Soon… we will be together."

The shiver down my spine is not from the cold.  


The dream returns.

The door opens again.

The world crumbles again.

The shadow takes me again.

But now, I see it.

It is not just a formless stain. Not just liquid blackness.

It is a tiger.

But its skin is not skin. It is something torn, something frayed, something hanging in strips like flesh left too long beneath the sun.

It does not move like an animal. Its body flickers, vibrating between the shape of a beast and something that should not exist.

Its mouth opens, and keeps opening, an abyss of jagged teeth.

And when it leaps, when its claws tear into me, when I feel my flesh yield

I wake.



The Colonel shakes me.

His face is tense. Too tense.

"Get up," he says. His voice is low, clipped, leaving no room for questions.

I sit up, heart hammering.

Something is wrong.

"What happened?" I whisper, though I already know the answer.

"Romulus," the Colonel mutters. "He’s gone."

A wave of cold rushes through me.

I rise fully, grip my weapon.

The wind has changed again. Thicker.

And in the distance, beyond the camp’s edge—something moves.

Something moans.



It is not human.

Nor is it animal.

It is a wet, gurgling howl.

Like a wolf drowning in its own blood.

The hairs on my neck rise.

The Colonel and I stand side by side, rifles raised, staring into the darkness.

We see nothing.

But we know something is there.

Watching.

Waiting.

And somewhere between us and that abyss, Romulus is missing.



The howls continue.

First distant.

Then nearer.

A grotesque symphony of noises no living thing should make.

And amidst that twisted cacophony

A voice.

Romulus.

But not his voice.

Something else has taken it.

"It is my son," it whispers.

"The one who will end mankind."

The voice echoes in my head, slipping beneath my skin like cold fingers pressing into my skull.

“He will end this false kingdom.”

I grip my rifle tighter, my breath coming in short gasps. The Colonel’s face is set in stone, his jaw clenched so tightly I hear his teeth grind.

Another howl cuts through the night.

It is close.

Too close.

We hear something, something shifting in the dark. Moving without rhythm, its footsteps uneven, limbs striking the earth with an unnatural, spasmodic weight.

The Colonel gestures, a sharp motion with his hand.

We move forward.

Step by step.

Past the edge of the firelight.

Past the place where Romulus last stood.

Into the thick, moonless dark.



We find him near the ridge.

Or, what is left of him.

He stands motionless, head tilted at an impossible angle. His arms hang limply at his sides. His feet, bare, pale, bloodless, are rooted into the dirt like he has grown from the earth itself.

His lips move, but the words come from everywhere at once.

“It is not too late.”

His voice is wrong. A chorus of whispers layered over each other, some soft, some guttural, all crawling into my ears like insects.

His head twitches, and the bones in his neck crackle.

I raise my rifle, and he, it, smiles.

A smile that stretches too far, splitting the skin at the corners of his mouth.



The Colonel does not hesitate.

He fires.

A direct shot, center mass.

The bullet tears into Romulus’s chest. Flesh ripples outward like a stone dropped in water.

But there is no blood.

No wound.

Only something beneath his skin, writhing, shifting, pushing outward against his ribs, his throat, his face.

The Colonel fires again.

And again.

And again.

Each shot hits. Each shot ripples.

Each shot does nothing.

Then,

Romulus moves.

I do not see it.

One moment he is standing before us.

The next, he is upon the Colonel.

His hands, no, not hands anymore, his meaty claws wrap around the Colonel’s throat.

Fingers too long.

Too many joints.

Skin too thin, stretched over something else.

Something that is not bone.

The Colonel struggles, gasping, trying to pry them away. But Romulus holds him firm, his grip tightening, the skin around his own fingers peeling, splitting apart like overripe fruit to reveal something dark and wet underneath.

I lift my rifle

But I freeze.

For just a second

Romulus’s eyes are staring at me.

They're not human.

They're pits.

Depthless, black voids, swirling like the center of a storm.

Something stirs within them.

Something vast.

Something old.

Something that is looking back at me.



I pull the trigger.

The shot splits his head open

But there is no blood.

Only darkness.

A thick, oozing blackness, pouring out like ink from a broken vessel. It spills down his body, soaking his clothes, hissing as it touches the ground.

Romulus does not fall.

He does not even flinch.

He only tilts his ruined face toward me

“It is not too late.”

His voice is inside my head. Inside my bones. Inside my teeth.

Then,

The Colonel screams.

His body convulses.

Romulus presses his hands tighter

The Colonel crumples like a puppet with its strings severed.

Not dead.

Not alive.

Something in-between.

Something worse.



I run.

Not from fear.

Not from Romulus.

But toward the center of the hill.

Toward it.

Toward the thing we were ordered to protect.

Romulus is going to break it.

I see him ahead of me, moving toward it.

His limbs are wrong. His skin is thin as parchment. His mouth moves, whispering things I cannot hear, cannot understand, cannot let him finish.

I raise my rifle.

He stops.

Slowly, he turns toward me.



"I will not leave my post,

Not if I hear it.

Not if I see.

I will not leave my post."



His lips stretch into a ruined smile.

And he speaks.

“This world was never ours.”

The ground shifts.

The air hums.

I pull the trigger.

Romulus stumbles.

Blackness spills from his chest.



"I will not leave my post,

Others have fled before.

Now they are here no more.

I will not leave my post."



He does not stop moving.

I fire again.

Romulus lunges.

I do not have time to aim.

I do not miss.

The shot tears through his skull.

His body jerks, once, twice, then collapses.

The whispers stop.

The air stills.

The ground is solid beneath me.

The seal Unbroken.



The next squadron finds me at dawn.

Standing.

Weapon still in my hand.

Romulus’s body at my feet.

The Colonel gone.

They ask what happened.

I say nothing.

I only repeat, over and over, beneath my breath:



"I will not leave my post.

Only I remain.

Even if I dont wake again.

I will not leave my post."

Somewhere, in some forgotten jungle, a tiger listens.

A blind man speaks of human strength.

Of human wisdom.

Of human dominion over all things.

The tiger does not answer.

It has no need for words.

It leaps

And devours him whole.

But when it lifts its head, when its breath is still thick with the scent of warm blood

It looks up.

And it sees the mouth of a rifle.

A single shot.

And the tiger understands.

Too late.

That the hunter got his prey.
