I’ve been dating Andy since high school. He’s a great guy– super sweet and fun. I consider him my best friend. He was there for me when my mom was sick my senior year, and helped me through a lot when she passed. He can always cheer me up, and we always have fun together.

He’s just really.. Well, needy.

He wants to know what I’m doing all the time, and who I’m with. Which is hard, because we aren’t at the same college. I make sure to video call him every night at 9PM, just to talk about everything that’s been going on. Honestly, I look forward to talking to him every day.

But he gets mad if I miss a call. Or put him off until 10.

I know he just wants me to be safe, especially since he can’t be here. He wants to look out for me.

 Sometimes, though, it’s a little too much. He acts standoffish if I hang out with any of my guy friends, even if it’s at a party with tons of other people there.

Anyway, here’s where I screwed up.

A few weeks ago our campus had a showing of *Alien* in the school theater. *Alien* is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I absolutely wanted to go. The thing is, I couldn’t get anyone else to go with me from my friend group except one other guy, John, who also loves movies just like I do.

The other problem? The movie was being shown at 9 PM.

I didn’t really want to admit to Andy that I was going to see a movie with one of my guy friends. Even though there was nothing between us, I knew how it looked.

The night of the movie, I casually turned off my phone, took a break from calling my boyfriend, and went to watch *Alien* with my friend and about 70 other students in the library basement.

It was a blast. I had never seen it on a big screen, and it was still as scary and fun as ever.

As we stepped out of the theater, laughing about how wild the movie was, we joined some others for a group photo.

“We’re going to put it on our Horror Society Instagram page,” Kayley babbled excitedly. “This is our biggest turnout for a movie showing we’ve had yet!”

I said goodbye to John and walked back to my dorm, where I braced myself to call Andy. I was already prepared with the lie.

“Hey,” I said quietly, “I’m so sorry. My phone died.”

“Oh really?” He asked, judgmentally. “Couldn’t you have found a charger?”

“Um.. I was at the library. Late night study group for our final.” It was a half- truth. I had met up with some people that day for a study group- at 4 in the afternoon.

Andy brushed it off, but was distant for the rest of the phone call. I knew he’d come around. The next day, we were back to normal, cutting up and making jokes again.

I didn’t think any more about it until the next week I saw that little green package card in my campus mailbox.

It was a package from Andy- for our anniversary. I immediately felt guilty for the little hiccup we’d had the week before. I tore it open.

It was a.. puzzle. Of our faces. Kinda gross, but kinda cute in a sappy sort of way. I guess he had it made at Walgreens or somewhere.

The picture was one of us that his mom took last summer. It was one of our better ones, and whenever I looked at it I was filled with happy feelings from all our memories together.

“I got your package in the mail today,” I said nonchalantly, later that evening. “That was so sweet of you.”

“Anything for you. Let me know when you put it together.”

“I will!”

I didn’t have time to try it out for several more days, when the weekend rolled around and a few of my friends came over. We we’re just hanging out, drinking a few beers, and I decided to get it out while we chit- chatted.

At first, we were confused. None of the colors in the puzzle pieces seemed to match the picture on the front of the box. I chalked it up to being a 1000 piece puzzle with a lot of flesh tone areas, which made it hard to tell what we were looking at.

After a few hours, and a few more beers, we hadn’t made a lot of progress. When they decided to leave and hit up a house party a few blocks away, I stayed behind.

There was something off about the puzzle. I decided to take another stab at it.

I arranged all the pieces by color, little piles for reds, beiges, oranges, browns, blacks, and whites. One pile by one, I examined each piece and found its matches.

Slowly, a picture began to emerge.

It just wasn’t the one on the box.

The picture was fuzzy. I couldn’t quite figure it out.

I placed the final piece sometime around 1:45 AM.

I just started at it for a while. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The puzzle was an extremely blown up and cropped picture of John and I at the *Alien* showing, cropped to make it look like we had been *together,* not just standing by each other.

The worst part? Our eyes have been scratched out. Not on the puzzle pieces themselves, so he must have done it on the original photo file sent to Walgreens.

I feel sick.

I haven’t let on that I know something is wrong. When I talk to Andy every evening I try to make it as normal as possible.

Yesterday he asked, “have you tried the puzzle yet?” And I had to just lie and say that I hadn’t.

I threw it away in the dorm dumpster the very next morning, so I don’t even have it anymore.

Worst of all- I’m moving back home next weekend, and I’ll have to face [him](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/)…
