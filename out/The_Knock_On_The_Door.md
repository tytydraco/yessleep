There was something unsettling about the knock on the door. It was the middle of the night and I was home alone, trying to get some much-needed rest after a long day at work. The knock was soft, almost hesitant, but it echoed through the empty house like a hammer striking an anvil.

I sat up in bed, my heart racing. Who could it be at this hour? I grabbed my robe and made my way downstairs, trying to quiet my pounding footsteps on the creaky old floorboards. I reached the door and peered through the peephole, but there was no one there.

I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. I had heard of people playing pranks by knocking on doors and running away, but something about this felt different. The knock had been too soft, too hesitant. It had almost sounded like someone was in pain.

I opened the door and stepped out onto the porch, scanning the darkness for any sign of movement. The only light came from the dim glow of the streetlamps, casting long shadows across the yard.

"Hello?" I called out tentatively. "Is anyone there?"

There was no response, only the soft rustling of leaves in the breeze. I was about to go back inside when I heard the knock again, this time louder and more urgent. It was coming from the side of the house.

I followed the sound, my heart pounding in my chest. As I rounded the corner, I saw a figure standing in the shadows. It was a man, his face twisted in agony.

"Please," he whispered, his voice barely audible. "Help me."

I rushed to his side, trying to make out his features in the darkness. He was clutching his stomach, and I could see blood seeping through his fingers.

"What happened?" I asked, my voice shaking. "Who did this to you?"

The man looked up at me, his eyes pleading. "It was my neighbor," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "He's gone mad. He's been knocking on my door for days, trying to get inside. He thinks I have something he wants. But I don't have anything. I swear it."

I felt a surge of fear as I realized the danger I was in. If this man's neighbor was capable of attacking him, who knew what he would do to me if he found me here.

"We have to get out of here," I said, helping the man to his feet. "Come on, I'll take you to the hospital."

But as we stumbled through the darkness, I heard the knock again, this time coming from behind us. I turned to see the neighbor standing in the yard, his eyes wild and his mouth twisted into a snarl.

"Give it to me!" he screamed, rushing towards us. "Give me what I want!"

I knew we had to get away, but the injured man was too weak to run. I wrapped his arm around my shoulder and began to half-carry, half-drag him towards the car.

As we reached the driveway, I heard the neighbor's footsteps behind us, gaining ground with every step. I fumbled with the keys, my hands shaking with fear.

Finally, I managed to unlock the car and get the injured man inside. I jumped into the driver's seat and started the engine, peeling out of the driveway just as the neighbor reached the car.

I didn't stop until we reached the hospital, my heart pounding in my chest. I never wanted to experience something like that again.

As I stepped inside my house, I locked the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to catch my breath. I was shaking with fear and adrenaline, my heart still pounding in my chest.

I knew that I had to call the police and report what had happened, but my hands were trembling so badly that I could barely dial the phone. Finally, I managed to get through and explain the situation to the operator, hoping that they would be able to catch the neighbor before he hurt anyone else.

As I waited for the police to arrive, I tried to calm myself down. I looked around my house, taking in the familiar surroundings, trying to find some comfort in the familiar.

But then, I heard the knock again. This time, it was coming from inside the house.

I jumped in shock, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of the neighbor. But there was no one there. The knock was coming from behind me.

I turned slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. And there, standing right behind me, was the neighbor.
