A friend of mine was spending the night at a hospital taking care of his relative. It was around 1am when my friend suddenly woke up to loud screaming. He quickly looked at his relative fearing the worst, but the screams were coming from outside his room. He went and opened the door and saw nurses running towards another hospital room.

My friend was curious so he stepped outside his own hospital room and made his way to the room where the screams were coming from. As he entered the room, he saw an old man looking right at the door (where my friend was now standing) and screaming - "tell them to go away; don't take me; move away from there; somebody HELP ME!"

The nurses looked at the door and saw my friend standing there and asked him to leave immediately. However, my friend was not the reason for the commotion because the patient continued to scream as my friend made his way back to his own hospital room.

The screams died down a few moments later. My friend was curious so he made his way out of the room again and got talking to one of the nurses. He asked her about the old man and she said the man doesn't have family to stay the night with him. He just had a surgery and probably had a panic attack being alone and was hallucinating. Nothing that some medicine couldn't fix so they gave the man something to calm him down and put him back to sleep. While my friend was talking to a nurse, her pager suddenly beeped and she ran down the corridor to another room. 

My friend came back to his room. He had had experience with paranormal in the past and he was, after all, in a hospital. He couldn't help but think the whole night that this couldn't be a simple panic attack. Next morning, when the breakfast rounds were being made and the hospital floor was full of staff and doctors, he quickly made his way to the room of the old man. He was relieved to see that the old man was still alone. His family hadn't come yet.

My friend told the old man that he heard him screaming and saw the fear in his eyes while staring at the door last night. If the old man didn't mind, can he tell what it was that he saw. The old said he was woken up and saw a huge "thing" standing at a door. It's body was of that like a human but was atleast 10 feet tall if not more. The face was completely dark but he could see red eyes. This things was at the door but the old man could hear it whispering "it's time to leave." The whispers were so clear as this thing was right next to the old man and not at the door. Traces of smoke was leaving this thing's body as it stood there at the door.

The old man said that all the time he screamed, the thing did not move from the door and kept on whispering that it's time to leave. The old man did not remember seeing my friend at the door. The old man said that while the nurses pumped some injection in him, he saw the figure turning and moving down the hospital corridor. The old man then probably fell asleep as he doesn't remember anything else.

My friend has no doubt that the old man did not have a random panic attack and was telling the truth. The old man was not hallucinating. Because right after this incident, someone in another room down the corridor suddenly died! That was the code the nurse had received on her pager when my friend was speaking to her.
