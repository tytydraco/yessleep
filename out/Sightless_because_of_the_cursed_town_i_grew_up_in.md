I have been haunted by darkness since the day i lost my sight. It happened when i was just ten years old, a fateful day in the mysterious town of Point Pine. My friend, Cody, was there when it happened.  
  
I can only share fragments, as my memories have faded with my sight. 

I lived in Point Pine for the longest time i can remember. I had parents. They passed away, in the town. When they dies, our house and everything in it, disappeared into thin air, and soo did their bodies, leaving me to the streets.

One day in august at the age of ten, Cody and i were set to find out what really happened during the parade that took place each month in Point Pine. Chorus of the forbidden parade reached our ears. The town's residents ran to the nearest shelter with locks while Cody and i hid in the forests, to witness the truth of the parade.  
The sound of distant music reached their ears, growing louder with each passing moment.  
  
I was taller than Cody, advantaging me to a clear sightline of the parade from our hiding spot.  
  
The parade emerged, it was a surreal spectacle that sent shivers down my spine. Bizarre creatures with twisted limbs and glowing eyes paraded through the streets, accompanied by an otherworldly melody. They were eating that girl, Reid, engulfing her from the head, multiple tenticles from the creatures thrusting into her body and what looked like sucking the life out of her. Reid was in a trans. Her eyes were all white, her lips purple, with those horrific tenticles sticking out from her.  
  
What shock me to the ground was Reid had a smile on her face. She looked happy, like she was pleasured by the antics of those creatures.  
  
Those things, they had seen me, glared into my soul. It was fate, i would be their next victim.  
I ducted away but it was too late. The voices had started to approach us. We were situated in our hiding place such that the parade had to pass in front of us, which meant, Cody would get a clear read of the scene. I was petrified.  
  
Cody was shorter, fortunately. He didn't see the nightmare that would haunt me forever. The morbid scene that would be the last thing i ever saw, a picture that would be plastered in my mind for the rest of my life.  
  
I took once last glance at the parade as i held Cody's head to the ground, shushing him. But as i looked, this time, i could "see" the chorus of the parade. The rhythms, in waves, came to me, chanting my name- "Look into my eyes Lee, take one look into my eyes."- propelling me to look into one of the creature's eyes. The creature, slowly turned its head towards me and in a snap, my world became dark. 

I fell to the ground, covering the dark holes where my eyes previously were, filled with regret and... pain. Pain in my heart, pain my my mind, not the pain from my eyes being taken off. The excruciating pain subsided, leaving behind a chilling emptiness that echoed in my shattered spirit. The haunting melody of the parade faded, replaced by the sound of my own sobs and the mocking whispers of the creatures- "Look into my eyes Lee, Look into my eyes, Lee."- those, that feasted upon my sight.  
  
I had no parents, i grew up on the streets. With my sight gone, i could no longer survive on my own in Point Pine.  
That night, with a makeshift cane, i walked with my memory. I walked down the main street and kept walking and walking, in a straight path. If an intersection appeared, i looked for stones beneath my feet and tossed them into the abyss. What direction the sound came, i walked the path, straight and ahead. I walked with no knowledge of time, space or health. In flight mode and escaping from Point Pine was all that ran threw my mind. At one point, out of pure exhaustion and dehydration, i passed out on the street.   
When i woke up, I was in a new city. A car passing through what had been the highway found me immobile and left me in the care of a shelter.   
  
Fifteen years passed, and I had retreated to a remote countryside, seeking solace from the terrors of my past. I found comfort working as a caf√© barista, embracing a mundane existence far from Point Pine.   
  
But one morning, I awoke in foreign, a familiar scent enveloping me.  
  
Confusion consumed me as i struggled to comprehend my surroundings. I reached out for my cane, but it was nowhere to be found. Panic welled up within me as i realized something inexplicable had happened. I stumbled around, searching for answers, only to discover the something seemed familiar. And then. it hit me at once.   
  
Point Pine had reclaimed me.  
  
In the darkness of Point Pine, the air hung heavy with a scent I thought I had long forgotten, a mixture of decay and despair. Panic gripped my chest as I reached out, only to find the absence of my sight, a cruel reminder of the grotesque fate that befell me years ago.  
  
Whispers echoed through the empty streets, their voices sinister and seductive, tempting me to unravel the mysteries that lay shrouded in the shadows. With trembling hands, I navigated the twisted paths,one hand stretched out, guiding me through the nightmarish world surrounding me, while the other, in front of me, sheilding me from the same world.  
  
Every footstep I took reverberated with an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional scuttling of unseen horrors lurking in the darkness. The wind whispered secrets, tales of forgotten souls and torture that danced through the haunted town, their presence ever-present, their malicious intent palpable.  
  
A cold, invisible hand caressed my face, sending shivers down my spine. I recoiled, but there was no escape from the chilling touch that clung to me like a specter. Shadows danced and twisted, mocking my blindness, their forms morphing into phantoms that whispered twisted promises of revealing the unknown.  
  
The town seemed alive, its structures breathing with a malevolent energy. I could feel the unblinking gazes of unseen entities upon me, multiple of their eyes, boring into my empty sockets, into my soul. Their whispered words carried the weight of despair, their insidious intentions devouring my sanity.  
  
  
In the distance, the faint strains of a mournful melody reached my ears. It was the forbidden parade, its haunting music a siren's call, tempting me to stray from the path of survival. I resisted, knowing all too well the consequence of casting my blind eyes upon the  procession.  
  
Time warped in Point Pine, minutes stretching into eternal torment.  
With each passing minute, the town's grip tightened, its sinister hold threatening to consume what little remained of my sanity. Whispers became screams, shadows coalesced into sinister entities that slithered and writhed, taunting me with their grotesque forms.  
  
As I stumbled through the labyrinth of horrors, a realization dawned upon me. Point Pine was not merely a place of nightmares; it was a sentient entity, an embodiment of darkness and malevolence. It reveled in my suffering, relished in the despair that clung to my soul.  
  
In the heart of the town, I stood, surrounded by a chorus of the damned. Their hollow cries reverberated through the desolate streets, mingling with the maddening whispers that filled the air. I embraced my fate, knowing that in Point Pine, my existence would forever be intertwined with the haunting, the creepy, and the mysterious.
