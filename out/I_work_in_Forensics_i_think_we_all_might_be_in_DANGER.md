  
I had been working in forensics for many years, but I had never seen anything like this before. It started out like a normal weekend. Friday was relatively quiet and I had time to get angry and sad about how many young people had landed on my Table lately. Here in New Canton, we’ve been struggling with poverty, gangs and a high crime rate among young people. They get into shootings, drug deals and prostitution as young as 14. Even at that young age, they see no other way out but crime. We need to work harder in New Canton to show kids a future that is better than having a bullet in their chest at 15. As I was packing my bag to go home, Detective Kumar came by and was probably happy to catch me. 

  
„Hey, Richard. You weren’t just leaving, were you?“ the detective asked.   
„Me? For the weekend? No way! What have you got for me, Ranjid?“ I asked.   
„Thank you, my friend. Do you know who we finally busted? The drug kingpin of the Albaz Cartel. We found this young woman in his cellar who’s about to come in. She was dead, but we don’t know what killed her. We had Nayla on the scene, but she said you’re gonna have to open her up to find anything. If we can still get him for murder, that would be a real breakthrough!“ he said excitedly.   
„Then I can’t help but hang on for another hour or two. The lasagna I’m putting in the microwave can wait,“ I replied. 

  
„Thank you very much. Call me when you have something.“   
„I will.“ 

  
Shortly afterwards, my colleagues wheeled the young lady in and, as always, I greeted her politely. Just because they were dead didn’t mean you had to be rude to people. Nayla, my colleague was right. There really was no external influence to be found. As coroners, it was our job to find out four things. The first was the cause of death. This could be a blow with a blunt object, drowning or a heart attack. Secondly, we had to clarify the manner of death. In other words, whether the person died a natural or unnatural death. Sometimes, as in this case, it is also necessary to establish the identity of the victim. We can often do this using the teeth. Another important factor for the investigators is, of course, the time of death, which we can determine from the temperature of the body, the degree of decomposition and other factors.

After I had carried out the usual examinations, I started the Y-cut. I folded the woman’s left and right to the side and took a step back. Her insides didn’t look like those of a human being. At least not like that of a healthy person. Her lungs and windpipe had completely collapsed and were barely visible. Instead, her oesophagus was swollen to twice its size and her heart was almost as big as a handball. What was even stranger was the greenish glow in some parts of her peritoneum. Whatever was going on with the woman, it was something sick. 

I had to take a closer look at the heart and probably send it to the lab. I couldn’t avoid sawing open her rib cage. So I took the small circular saw from my workbench and exposed her heart. When I cut the blood vessels leading to and from the heart to take it out, not only was there blood dripping out, but also a smelly green liquid. Damn, Detective Kumar wouldn’t believe what I found on the phone. As I put the heart in a plastic box, I noticed something on her stomach. Someone had carved a few letters on it. I took a closer look and read the following: Model 388: „Mother“. 

What the hell was that supposed to mean? I put the heart over to the samples I was going to send in and sat down at my laptop to take notes. I thought about the sick stories I’d heard from the north. Supposedly there were a few cases of walking corpses and people suffering terrible mutations. The government blamed it on the bath salts drug and conspiracy theories from the internet. But I could worry about that later. Now I would continue working to finally get home. I turned around again and couldn’t believe my eyes. The young woman had a bloated lower abdomen. She almost looked like she was heavily pregnant. I couldn’t help but think of the name carved on her belly. Mother. At first the sight frightened me, but then I came to my senses. 

There were several chemicals that could trigger such a process after death. Now it was up to me to find out which one it was. But I didn’t get around to it at first. I had heard something. Was it a... throbbing? Confused, I looked at the samples. More precisely, to the transparent container with the woman’s heart. It... Beating again? How could that be? Well, there were drugs that could cause a muscle to twitch even after death, and our heart was a kind of muscle after all, but somehow it didn’t look like it. At first it was just a throbbing, then it started to move more violently. I had never experienced anything like it in my whole career. 

The heart moved so violently that the container slid back and forth on the table. Then the organ tore open at one point and dozens of little spiders crawled out of the heart along with a green liquid. Whatever was going on here, it was definitely beyond my expertise. Maybe there was a connection to the undead and the mutated humans after all. If so, we had to call the FBI immediately. Since I didn’t want to decide that on my own, I called Rankid. 

  
„Yes? Have you found anything?“ he asked.   
„Oh man, you won’t believe what I found. It’s sick and I can’t describe it to you on the phone. Why don’t you come down and see for yourself?“ 

  
„I will. Hang on, there’s something going on. I’ll be right with you.“ Detective Kumar said and hung up.    
As soon as he was down here, I would feel better too. I wasn’t hungry for lasagna anymore. My mind was finally blown when I saw the young woman’s body suddenly standing in front of me. I couldn’t see any life in her eyes, she looked as dead as before. But she was standing about two meters away from me, that was a fact. Two voices were now fighting with each other in my head. One told me that I could explain all of this with heavy drugs that had probably been tried on her and were now innervating her nerves. 

The other voice told me that I could forget all the crap I had learned in medical school. Because this wasn’t medicine. This was something evil. All our fears were true, there were undead, vampires and demons. The darkness had come and was now shattering my reality. But the medic in me was able to gain the upper hand. 

Through her open torso, I could see something rising from her stomach and being pushed into her gullet. Shots rang out above me in the police station, but I could only hear them distantly. The mother sprayed a disgusting green liquid into my face from her mouth, smelling of pus and stomach acid. I got a lot of it in my eyes and mouth. 

At first I felt the urge to throw up. But then it disappeared. My vision was now blurred. And I was also thinking in a blur. Instead of wanting to throw up or call Kumar, I only wanted one thing. I wanted to eat. And I wanted to hear the man’s voice. I was changing. I think my Heart just stopped beating. The mother had given birth to me. Now I have to stop. The man of peace is calling for me. I am sorry for what i am about to do. Pray for me. Pray for all of us, for gods sake.
