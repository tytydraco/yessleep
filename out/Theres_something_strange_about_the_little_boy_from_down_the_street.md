There's something strange about the little boy from down the street.



Our new house was in a nice little neighborhood on the outskirts of a large metropolitan city that wasn't known for its hospitable reputation. So you can imagine my relief when I found my little family a cute little abode in a mostly retirement-age community. While there was no age requirement, almost all of the residents of Springcrest Village were sixty years old or older. They'd abandoned the busy city life to live out the rest of their days in a new upscale community where they found fellowship with people with shared life experiences.

Springcrest had everything they could ever need. It was situated right next to this fancy golf course, ideal for keeping those old joints moving. A well-maintained pool, excellent for keeping their aging skin nice and leathery for all to admire. Most importantly, there were no schools nearby, which meant no pesky children to ruin the old folk's peace and quiet.

We drove into our new picturesque life and were met with a multitude of smiles and waves. Ricky and I are a middle-aged couple, something rather strange to see driving down the roads of Springcrest Village.

'Maybe they thought someone's adult children had come by to visit Mamma and Poppa?' I imagined them thinking as we drifted past the identical housing. Everyone seemed really kind. That is until they noticed the Penske truck tailing behind our little Corolla. Their faces changed from looks of welcome to emotions of disgust. Some gesturing over to their spouses to come and look at the impending tragedy. The Yellow moving truck sped past them and I saw a few grumpy old men throw their hands up in frustration.

'So much for a warm welcome." I thought to myself. I looked over at Ricky as he journeyed onward unfazed by the many twisting looks.

Our car slowed over to the side of the street, coming to a halt in front of our new forever home, leaving the driveway spot available to the moving truck. The movers got straight to work.

As the rolling door on the Penske truck clinked against the metal stopper, the sound of metal on metal echoed through the quiet neighborhood.

"Let's get to work boys!" The driver yelled at his mostly college-aged laborers. The commotion brought many silver-haired women and grey beards to the windows, some coming out onto their lawns to show their disapproval with their hands placed firmly on their hips. To say that I was extremely uncomfortable was an understatement.

I itched my arm in an attempt to quell my nerves. Ricky noticed my uneasiness and wrapped a hand around my shoulder. His embrace worked for the most part, and the old folks looking on slowly vanished from my mind as I looked up at Ricky's face of admiration taking in the sight of our little three-bedroom home.

"Mom?" I felt a tug on my pant leg and looked down to see Daniel, our seven-year-old son, trying to get my attention.

"What is it honey?" I said as I patted a hand on the back of his head in a comforting gesture.

"Look." He pointed to the neighbor's rose bushes. It took a minute to realize Daniel hadn't suddenly become an avid rose connoisseur

Beyond the many reds and whites of the flower petals, through the thorned bushes, and hidden behind a little angel statue, were a pair of little eyes peering out at us. It was a little boy.

I breathed a slight sigh of relief when I realized that Daniel would not be the only child in our neighborhood.

"It's Okay honey, go say hi." I gave Daniel an encouraging shove as he hesitantly took a few steps forward.

"H-Hi." Daniel quivered but the boy behind the statue seemed to shy way behind the angel's comforting stone body. Daniel looked back over at me, searching for some kind of instruction. I waved him forward, he took a few more tentative steps.

"I- I'm Daniel." Daniel outstretched a hand in a manner we'd taught him to do, a cordial introduction. The boy seemed to completely disappear behind the angel as his hands now gripped its hard exterior. Daniel took a few more steps until his arms brushed up against a few roses. Just then the frightful boy darted through to foliage, snagging his shirt on one of the thorn branches. His little orange tee shirt ripped as cotton fabric clung to the sharp twigs. With surprising agility, he leaped over some of the rose bushes and disappeared from view. Daniel stood there confused, granted I was too.

"Strange boy," Ricky said.

"Yeah, strange indeed," I said under my breath while still trying to make sense of the situation.

"Come on Daniel. Let's go pick out your room." Ricky shouted. Daniel snapped out of his surprise and ran his little feet into the house. Just then I too came out of my stooper.

"Wait, take your shoes off, it's new carpeting!" I yelled. As we all walked through the door, I couldn't help but return my gaze to the little angel statue, once again, the boy's little eyes peered out from behind as the door slowly creaked closed.

\*\*\*

Daniel was Homeschooled. We'd never trusted the public education system. Often, kids don't get the attention they require, most times they are just names on some roster. Ricky and I knew this. Soon after we got married we concluded that I would stay home and school our children ourselves. Hence our disregard for adequate schooling near Springcrest Village.

Unlike many other home educators, we as a couple felt we were more than qualified for the task of molding our young son's mind. Ricky was a professor at a community college about a half hour's drive from our new dwelling, and I had my masters in social work, though I no longer practiced. Ricky made plenty and I had my hands full with our rambunctious seven-year-old.

On this particular day, Daniel and I were working on long division. Yes, our second grader is slightly more advanced than the normal school curriculum, something Ricky and I loved to take credit for. This aptitude however did not grant him the same level of patience.

"Aww, mom. I don't get why I have to learn this stuff." He wined while laying his head on our kitchen table, his eyes firmly planted on the vivid imagery coming from the other side of the window.

"Now Daniel, I know this is hard but you have to try and focus, just a few more practice problems and we can stop for the day," I informed him. To my annoyance, he returned a disrespectful grunt. I couldn't help but scowl at his rudeness.

I reached for the ruler on the table and planted a mild slap on the tip of his nail bed.

"Ouch!" Daniel retorted, bringing his hand to his mouth while huffing a few hot breaths of air as if the mist could ease the pain. He eyed me with a mild sense of anger. Yes, I hit my son.

His eyes slowly started to melt from a look of anger to one of understanding.

"Sorry, Mom." He said as he lowered his eyes. It's not often that a kid relinquishes his emotions when they know they did something wrong, which made me proud of my boy. I caressed his face, squeezing his cheeks and forcing him into a pucker. I brought my nose in and glided it back and forth on his like I used to do when he was a baby.

"I'm sowwy my little cupcake." My baby voice made him shy away.

"Mom." He said with an inflection, I gave a mild chuckle. Just then I saw his eyes turn to the window, a look of surprise plastering its mark on his face. I turned to whatever caught his eye and gave a slight jolt as my eye met the glass.

On the other side, stood the boy from the first day we'd moved in. He was dirty, wearing the same orange shirt as the day he spied us from the rose bushes. His arms were scratched, visible streaks of red running down his skin, it must've been the rose bushes that'd done it. His face had an aura of judgment to it.

"It's that boy," Daniel whispered. The boy on the other side would not lose his connection with my son. Seconds turned to minutes, and it started to get a bit awkward, more than it already was.

"Mom?" Daniel said with a questioning change in pitch.

"Can I go say hi? I looked into my son's eyes and realized that it had been some time since he'd socialized with someone his own age. Guilt washed over me. Sometimes I forget that Daniel needs to interact with people his age.

I gave him a somber smile, I could tell Daniel knew I was mauling his question over in my mind, a grin inched his way across his face, one that said 'Come on please'. I slammed the book sitting on the table shut.

"Okay go, but we have to do a few extra problems tomorrow."

"You're the best mom!" He said as he shot out of his chair and made his way to the front door. I remained sitting at the table, as I lost Daniel from view, but just then I remembered the kid at the window.

A shiver ran down my spine as his eyes were glued on me, I don't think I'd ever seen the boy blink. That is until I saw eyelids closing horizontally. My skin crawled. His gaze trained on me, the sound of the front door unlatching in the background. From the right corner of the window ran Daniel, an excited pep in his step.

"Come on let's go play." The strange boy lost his connection with me and ran off onto our front lawn. Falling on the grass and rolling around in its green pigment that now added to his already filthy shirt. Daniel tagged him and the boy gave chase. The two ran out of sight.

I stood there contemplating what I'd just seen, Ricky's words on move-in day replaying in my head.

'Strange boy.'

"Strange. Strange indeed." I whispered.

\*\*\*

Later that evening Ricky, Daniel, and I sat eating at the dinner table. It's our custom to accompany Ricky for a good meal after a long day's work. Ricky recounted the frustrations of his day.

"The administration wants us to skim over half of the textbook. They say it's too controversial to teach Shakespeare's plays. I mean the themes may be difficult to stomach in some instances. Sure there is death, suicide, and murder, but it's great literature."

Ricky was a talker. Even more so when he was passionate about something, that is one of the reasons I fell in love with him, but I have to admit that sometimes I just let him ramble on. Nodding my head whenever I thought he posed a question, smiled when it seemed appropriate, and asked a few questions here and there. I'd come to know how to navigate my husband, but Daniel seemed to find it difficult to learn how to stop his father's long-winded speeches.

I looked over at him as he pushed around his peas with his fork. He noticed me watching him as his father continued speaking of Shakespeare's greatness. I knew something was weighing on his mind, but he couldn't find the right moment to speak. I attempted to halt Ricky's soliloquy.

"I mean Ophelia. What a character. I have to say that Hamlet is my favorite play of all time."

"Honey?" I tried to interject but my first attempt failed at arresting his talking points.

"I mean 'To be or not to be', what a line!"

"HOney!?"

"And the ghost at the beginning of the play, talk about goose bum--"

"RICKY!" I finally got him to stop. He looked at me as I gestured over at Daneil's sad face with my eyes. It took a second or two but he caught on. I outstretched my hand tapping Daniel's arm.

"Are you okay baby? Ricky looked at both of us and awaited an answer.

"Y-Yeah." I could tell that he wasn't telling me the truth, I looked over at Ricky before gently pressing my line of questioning further.

"Are you sure? You know you can tell us anything right." I said to him as the gears turned in his head presumably trying to formulate what he was trying to say. I clasped his hand, giving him as much comfort as I could. He finally looked into my eyes and spoke up.

"I-It's that boy from earlier today. The one with the orange shirt." I looked over at Ricky, his eyes made the connection.

"The boy that was hiding in the roses?" My husband asked for clarification. I could tell that my husband had interrupted Daniel's train of thought and I waved him off.

"Y-yeah." Daniel spoke in a shaky tone.

"What is it honey, what about the boy?" I could see the sorrow in his eyes.

"Well, it's that I'm worried about him. I- I don't think he's okay." My frustration grew as I just wanted him to spit it out.

"Go on," I said in a forced calmness.

"Well, we were playing outside, and um-- well he knocked over the neighbor's trash can." The scene replayed in his mind.

"And-- he started eating the stinky food that spilled out. I tried to make him stop, but um--" A long dramatic pause followed, and Daniel swallowed hard.

"Well-- he scratched me."

Ricky erupted in laughter.

"All of this over a scratch. It's just how boys rough house. When I was your age my brothers and I would--" Just as Ricky's next speech commenced Daniel lifted his shirt thrusting the words back into his father's throat. My heart sank as far down as any mother's would upon seeing their child wounded.

Down the side of Daniel's rib cage, across his oblique, and stopping at his pelvic bone were four deep scratch marks that looked like they came from a bear, rather than a child. That did not look like roughhousing to me.

"T--There's more," Daniel said quiveringly. 'how much worse could it get?' I thought to myself as my hand guarded my open mouth.

"Well, his grandma, or what I think was his grandma came out when she heard me scream, and well she-- she put a collar and leash on him and then sprayed him with a water bottle. The kid tried to scream but I could tell the collar hurt him when he did." 'A shock collar' was the first thing that came to mind.

I looked over at Ricky to see him speechless, it's not often he's left without words.

"Honey? What's the kid's name?" I asked him, but he gave me a shrug.

"He doesn't talk. I don't think he can." My former profession as a social worker did not prepare me for the things coming from my kid's mouth. I looked at the ceiling as I tried to find the right words. When I found them I returned my attention to Daniel, but before I could speak, a figure caught my eye in the dining room window. I gave a shriek that made everyone turn to the glass. It was the little boy, a black collar around his neck, as he stared at me with as much intensity as he did earlier that day. I was paralyzed in shock.

Ricky stood from his chair and ran to the door. I heard him shout 'Hey wait'. The boy's head shot to the porch light before he darted off into the rose bushes, disappearing into the dead of night.

\*\*\*

"You have to call the police You're not a social worker anymore," Ricky whispered as we lay under the covers of our bed. I understood what he was telling me, but I needed to go see what was happening myself. There was something in the kid's eyes that gave me the impression that he was asking me for help. Me, not the police, or social services, but me and me alone. I knew if I tried to explain my logic to my husband it would just fall on deaf ears.

"You wouldn't understand," I said to him.

"You're really going to go over there yourself tomorrow aren't you?" I didn't respond, my resolve was conveyed by my silence. Ricky knew I was a bit hard-headed, he just gave a frustrated grunt.

"Well, at least wait for me to come home tomorrow and we'll go over there together." The request seemed valid, though I would be antsy all day until he got home from work the next afternoon. I rolled over and planted a kiss on his lips. I think he took that as me agreeing to his terms because he drifted off into a restful sleep. I, however, stared at the ceiling for the rest of the night.

I was already wasting time lying in bed while that poor child suffered in some horror house. As soon as the opportunity presented itself I was going to see about the boy from down the street.

\*\*\*

The morning light shone through the window as I lay in my bed building the courage to walk down the street to the little boy's house. Ricky had gone to work about an hour prior, but my resolve from the night before had drifted away at some points during the night. There's something about the warmth of a cozy bed that washes away all bravery.

So many thoughts had run through my head throughout the night, but no matter what the image of the little boy being tortured never left my mind. I thought of the shock collar cutting into the skin on his neck, of his filthy clothes, of the scratches on his arms.

'Had they really come from the rose bushes?' I thought to myself.

Finally, I managed to slip my legs out from under the sheets. I sat there contemplating my next move. How was I going to confront the woman abusing that little child?

"Mom?" Daniel's little voice called from the door. I looked over at him and I could see bags under his eyes, the glow of sweat covering his skin, and an evident urgency in his face.

"Mom, I don't feel good." His voice was extremely shaky. Like a lioness to her cub, I rushed over to my baby as if I was going to be able to scare off whatever illness was plaguing him. I palpated his forehead.

"My God! Your burning up?" His little body shucks under my touch. His knees seemed uneasy, just then I felt him give a slight stumble. I arrested his fall before he regained his feet through his own will.

"Come on let's get you back to bed," I told him. We shuffled off into the quiet house.

\*\*\*

After some Tylenol and some breakfast, Daniel's fever had finally come down. He now rested comfortably under his Transformers sheets as his little breaths gave a slight snore through his stuffy nose. He was fast asleep. I was extremely relieved. As I gazed at my son's face I couldn't help but wonder how anyone could abuse a little child. The images of the little boy were rearing their head again.

I looked at my phone noting the time, 11:23 a.m. I grunted in my frustration. It would be another few hours until Ricky got off work. The little boy's injuries tormented my existence. The memory of his blank stare cut into my soul. I know he was trying to tell me something. Just then Daniel's words from the night before replayed in my thoughts.

'He doesn't talk. I don't think he can.'

How was this boy supposed to ask for help when he'd probably been shocked by a collar every time he opened his mouth? I walked out of Daniel's room and over to the front window.

A few houses down, I could see where the little boy lived. I gripped the hem of my robe while looking back at my son. 'He's going to be asleep for the next couple of hours' I thought to myself. Just enough time to go see about this boy. I opened the door and walked out into the morning sun.

Every step I took, I could feel my heart pounding harder and harder. I'd seen child abuse cases many times in my former profession, but no matter what I could never get used to the horrors I was faced with. I don't know how some people could become numb to these situations. I never could, that's part of the reason why I quit.

The walk seemed quicker than I'd liked, I was now inches from the house's front door. I raised a hand to knock but just before my knuckles could grace the wood, something brushed up against my leg. I looked down to see a striped cat, purring as it rubbed itself on my shin. Something caught my eye on the cat's collar. There was a little blinking square attached to it. This wasn't an ordinary collar, it was a shock collar.

I heard another meow, from the door. I hadn't yet noticed the doggie door at the foot of the entranceway. Poking its head out was a siamese, as you could guess, a shock collar around his neck as well. Just as the cat's tail exited the doggie door, the larger door it was attached to swung open. In the center of the frame stood a tiny old lady, and then the worst smell of my life hit my nose.

From behind the woman, came the putred smell of shit, urine, and death. As the woman held the door open half a dozen other cats walked their way to the door, some walking up to my feet and rubbing their bodies on me. My eyes watered as I tried hard not to gag.

"What! What the hell do you want!?" The woman said in a rusty voice, a rather annoyed one at that. I held my wrist up to my nose trying to unsuccessfully stop the smell from entering my nostrils.

"Sorry to bother you ma'am, but is this the house of the little boy that's been playing with my son?" The woman eyed me with a mix of anger and slight surprise.

"No! No little boy's here, only my babies!" She gestured to the felines at my feet as more creeped out from behind her.

"Now go away, 'Days of Our Lives' Is about the start! Come on babies let's go back inside." She spat out in anger, then abruptly changed to a tone of sweetness. As the last cat walked back into the house the old lady moved to close the door in my face. My social worker instincts kicked in. I reached my hand out and stopped the door from slamming shut.

"Excuse me. Did you say 'Days of Our Lives'? I Love that show, but I haven't been able to watch it since we moved into our new house. We're still waiting for the cable guy." I pointed over at my home, just a few doors down the street.

"I'm dying to know what happened between Xander and Brady." The woman was slightly taken aback by my hand on her door, but her look of surprise eventually morphed into one of delight.

"You watch 'Days of Our Lives?'" she said.

"Of course! Best show in the world." I said fainting my enthusiasm. She took the bait.

"WELL COME ON IN! Any friend of Brady is a friend of mine." She stepped aside gesturing that I could come in. Walking into the house the smell was no better. I'm not sure what but something had died in here.

Cats are usually very clean creatures, but in this case, they were using the carpet as their litter box. We reached the couch, and I could see that its fabric matched the filthy carpet.

"Take a seat. I'll get you some lemonade." I cautiously obliged, perching myself on the very edge of the couch, trying to avoid my backside from touching as much of the dirty fabric as I could. While the old woman rustled in the kitchen, I looked around to see if I could find any sign of the little boy from the window, but there was nothing that signaled a child residing in this hell hole. I looked at the pictures on the wall, almost all of them were of one cat or another. There must've been hundreds. But one large image did catch my eye. One of the old women and a man about her age siting on the same couch, surrounded by many, many cats.

Just then, the clinking of ice against glass snapped me out of my daydream. The woman was handing me the glass full of lemonade. I reached out and grasped it. I looked down into its contents and saw a few cat hairs floating around inside. I tried not to wince.

"Take a sip, tell me what you think. It's my own special recipe." The woman waited eagerly for me to taste the beverage. I couldn't blow my cover so I was forced to press my lips on the brim of the glass, wetting them slightly. I looked back up at the woman, holding back my vomit.

"Mmm... Go-- Good." The old woman smiled.

"My secret is to add mint." As she mentioned it I saw a few green leaves floating around the cubes of ice. She took a seat on the recliner on the other side of the living room, her personal glass in hand. As her rickety bones relaxed onto the cushion she gave a long drawn-out huff. Instantly, several cats jumped to comfort themselves against the warmth of her skin.

The striped cat that first caressed against my shin at the door, now inched its way over her shoulder, across her arm, and stuck its little head down into the glass. I watched disgustingly as it lapped up some of the glass's contents. To my surprise, the woman still raised the cup to her mouth afterward and took a few big gulps. She looked over at me somberly, taking a few seconds to revel in the fact that she had made a new friend.

"My Husband Gerold used to watch 'Days of Our Lives' with me all the time. Now he's so old he won't even get out of bed." She gestured towards a door, off to the side of the living room.

"The old gas bag, he's not good for much these days. The good thing about his illness is he is not as chatty as he used to be." She noticed my surprise when she commented.

"It's Okay, the doctors say that there isn't much to be done for him now, but it's fine, he's outlived all of their expectations. The hospice nurse Jenny said that he'd be dead within a few weeks, but here we are months passed his 'death date' and he's still with us. The whore didn't know a thing about caring for the sick so I fired her. I can take care of my husband as good as any scrub-touting bitch." She chuckled in some off-brand style of humor unfamiliar to me. When she saw that I wasn't laughing she shot her gaze over at me. I forced a nervous giggle. Her attention now turns to the TV. Grabbing the black remote on the coffee table she clicked the power button and the old box TV roared to life. Nothing but static plastered its mark on the small 32-inch.

"These damn cats, they bump into everything." She pointed at the antenna resting on top of the TV." I jerked slightly as I wrestled with the idea of moving the air antenna around myself, but the woman stopped me.

"No, no, no. I'll get one of my babies to fix it for us, don't you bother your sweet little heart." She raised a shaky voice.

"Fluffy! Oh Fluffy." I heard some commotion coming from the bedroom where her husband supposedly rested. Its door swung open and my senses were completely overwhelmed. Standing in the passage was the little boy. The same one I'd come here to find. The smell wofting from behind the child, made me want to off myself.

"Fluffy is so smart. That's why he's always been my husband's favorite." The woman said as the boy stared at me with the same intensity as he did from the other side of my window.

"You know what to do Fluffy." The woman pointed over at the TV antenna. The boy did not hesitate and ran over to the TV, moving the two metal protrusions around until 'Days of Our Lives' came into focus.

"That's a good boy Fluffy." The woman praised while patting her lap. The boy took that as a signal to run over to her lap. He jumped onto her legs belly first, making the woman grunt as his weight fell on her fragile bones.

"You're getting too big for this you stinker." She reprimanded lovingly. Her hand glided down the back of his head and to my horror, I heard a very feline purr coming from his mouth.

The shock of the situation made me feel woozy, and a heat wave started to wash over me. I had no choice but to take a few big gulps of the hairy lemonade. The woman noticed my shock.

"It's okay dear. You keep drinking that lemonade, it will all be over soon." Her advice sounded valid in my discombobulated state, so I did as she said and finished the glass. I looked over at the little boy and thought I was starting to see things.

From the top of his little jeans crested a bushy little tail and his ears were rather pointed. His eye met mine his pupils morphed into a long skinny diamond. Then it hit me. What did she mean by 'it will all be over soon?'

I looked at her face, she now smiled mischievously as a bout of vertigo washed across my body.

'D-Did she put something in my drink?' I took to my feet and found it hard to find my center of gravity. I have to get out of here, but as I looked to the door my passage was blocked by a hoard of hissing cats.

"Fuck, Fuck, Fuck." I scanned around the room, to see my only escape route being the door where the rotting smell was emanating from. I stammered in that direction as quickly as I could.

"There's no use in running dear. You're not going to make it far." The woman giggled as I shut the door behind me. To my horror, the door didn't have a lock. I pressed my back against the entrance. Baracading it as I slumped to the floor. When my eyes locked on the bed, I gave a very loud shriek.

Atop the bed, was the rotting corpse of the woman's decaying husband, the striped cat that greeted me at the door had somehow found its way onto the dead man's chest. The cat's eyes met mine and it leaped towards me. I heard its little metal name tag clinking with its motion. It curled itself next to me and the lettering on the tag caught my eye. I held it up trying to make sure I was reading it right. It read:

'**Jenny**'

'Wasn't that the name of the hospice nurse?' My last thought before my eyes went completely dark.

\*\*\*

I was awoken by a pounding headache. The light meeting my eyes made me squirm, but my vision became clearer as the seconds passed. I saw that I was laying on the woman's couch. I looked over at the recliner to see the old lady stroking a half-human, half-cat sleeping on her lap. I wanted to scream, but as my breath graced my vocal cords a surge of electricity ran through my body. I gripped at something coiling around my neck. It was a shock collar. My hands made their way around the collar, searching for some clasp, something I could unhook so I could finally speak. To my terror, there was a little padlock on the back of my neck, trapping me in a voiceless hell. That, however, was not the only piece of metal hanging from the collar.

Under my chin hung a little heart with a name engraved into it. It read:

'**Pounce**'

The woman laughed.

"Do you like it? It's your new name.' She said. I tried to make a run for the door, but as my feet darted across the carpet, I received a zap that forced me to the floor. I swiveled around to see the old lady holding a remote control.

"You're not going anywhere. You're mine forever." As I lay there I heard the doggie door swing open and the old lady's screams of excitement.

"Oh look! My other new baby made it back home." My heart dropped when I saw the familiar face of my own son squeezing himself through the tiny opening. Only he looked different. A little hairier, his ears slightly more pointy, and a judgemental look in his eyes.

The woman ran over and placed a collar around his neck too.

"I was worried the scratch wouldn't take." She said in relief. Just then the long scratch across my son's body came back into memory. I scanned my own body and found I too was riddled with long deep cuts. I reached for my ears and felt the horrific sensation of pointed peaks.

"Don't you worry about that, you'll get used to them. Soon you're going to be like Jenny there." She pointed at the striped cat perched on the TV.

"In the meantime, make yourself at home." Daniel did as instructed and disappeared into the dimly lit house. It took me a while to come to terms with what was happening but I too decided to do some exploring. I figured it could be a good opportunity to plot my escape.

Going from door to door, I found a little office space. To my surprise, an old computer rested atop a desk. While this old machine is slow and needs to be updated, it works well enough to make my plea for help. Someone come save me and my son. Get word to my husband too because I know that he's going to come looking for us. He already has his suspicions about the house down the street. Tell him to stay away.

And for the love of God, never move to Springcrest Village.
