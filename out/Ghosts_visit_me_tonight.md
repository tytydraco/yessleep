My name is Manuel. I've spent half my life in the construction business, although in a place like Almagro that means much more than laying bricks. Here, if you have money and know how to pull strings, you end up with more power than the mayor and the priest put together. And I have it.

When I was awarded the contract to restore the church of San Agustín, I knew it was a sure thing: a beautiful façade, subsidized work, and prestige. But everything went wrong the day my men lifted the floor of the central nave.

There, buried without a name, we found the remains of eighteen friars. Some in rotten coffins, others wrapped in old rags. All wearing black habits. Augustinians, no doubt. I counted them myself. Eighteen. Buried for more than two centuries, maybe more. Forgotten by everyone... except God, I suppose.

I knew what would happen if I reported it to the Heritage Department: work would be halted, inspections, endless paperwork. And I couldn't afford any delays. I had loans, interest payments, and suppliers who wouldn't wait. So I did what I thought was necessary.

I called the usual people. That same night, with no witnesses, we loaded the remains into a van and took them to the old cemetery. To a mass grave that no one visits. No names. No mass. No permission. We buried them like dogs. And we sealed the silence with a couple of bottles of whiskey and an envelope in the sacristy.

I thought that would be enough. That if you bury the past deep enough, it stays there.

But I was wrong.

The dead... don't forgive.

Since then, I've tried to get on with my life as if nothing had happened. But last night... something changed... They started coming.

It's ten o'clock at night when I get home. I'm exhausted from checking bills, crunching numbers, and looking for solutions that never come.

I've managed to balance the books—a miracle—and I've just sent them to the accountant. In the kitchen, I nibble at something without appetite. Then I turn on the television to see if tonight I'll be lucky and get a better night's sleep. The television talks to itself in a language I don't want to understand.

It oppresses me. I turn off the television. I just want to sleep. I pour myself two whiskies, Johnnie Walker Black Label, looking for a shortcut to oblivion. The first one hits me hard; the second one numbs me. The silence in the house doesn't calm me down: it seems to be waiting for something.

I go up to my bedroom. I feel that the darkness doesn't begin in the hallway , but inside me. As I step on the last step, I hear a creak that I don't like. I don't stop. I let myself fall onto the bed like an empty sack. Darkness envelops me. The alcohol drags me down.

I am awakened by banging. Dry. Direct. As if someone were hammering something into the wall. I look at the clock: it is three in the morning. The air is freezing. I feel that I am not alone. I sit up. I feel the hairs on my arms stand on end. There is something in the room. It is watching me.

The banging continues, now echoing from the hallway... no, from below.

The echo changes location as if playing with me. I think, “Who's the son of a bitch hammering at this hour?” But my inner voice sounds shaky. The banging stops. And then, a voice—masculine, deep, hollow—whispers my name:

“Manuel... Manuel...”

My name doesn't sound like it's in the air. It echoes inside me. Each syllable resonates in my chest as if I were being beaten from within, marking the beat of an ancient fear.

I get up. I don't think, I act. I go down the stairs barefoot, feeling the cold wood under my feet. The floor seems damp  cold, as if someone had walked on it with wet feet.

There is no wind, but the doors creak. There are no footsteps, but the floorboards groan.

I curse myself for not sleeping downstairs. When I arrive, the lights in the living room flicker. Then they go out. The switch doesn't respond. And then, a bluish, almost purple light floods the room. There is fog, thick and low, as if the house were breathing.

Now I'm petrified. A thick fear that paralyzes my stomach. The voice returns:

“Manuel... give me back my brothers...”

And it's not just one voice anymore. There are several. Men's voices, deep, choral, ancient. They confuse me.

I see a figure in the courtyard. Tall. Motionless. A monk dressed in black, with his hood up. He's watching me. He has no face, but he's looking at me. He's wearing a wet habit. Water is dripping... but there's no puddle. The air smells of damp, old cassocks and confinement.

“Where did you bury my brothers?”

I don't know if he said it... or if I heard it inside my head. Suddenly, the voices intone a chant in Latin. A lament:

*Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam...*

*Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum dele iniquitatem meam...*

The singing does not come from the hall. It vibrates within the walls. Inside me. It's a prayer. But it sounds like a condemnation.

I can't scream. The voice is stuck in my throat. I pull my hair. I pinch my arm. I'm not dreaming. This is real. The air is heavy. It smells of old dampness, of enclosed stone. The creaking of the floor mixes with the whispers. Something brushes against my ankle. There's nothing there.

I run up the stairs. I stumble. I fall. The impact wakes me up for a second. I get up limping, panting, without looking back.

“Leave me alone! I beg you!”

The voices don't stop. The blows continue, dry, distant. A phrase haunts me:

“We won't rest until you pay...”

I throw myself onto the bed and cover myself with the blanket like a child. It's as if I've been put in an open coffin and covered with blankets. I press the pillow against my ears. I'm shaking. Only then do I understand why children believe that blankets scare away monsters.

I feel something at the edge of the bed. A presence. Dense. Silent.

I know they're there, even though I can't see them. Even though they're not breathing.

I don't dare look. I don't know if I've just seen the dead... or if it's my own conscience cast in shadow. The only things that are certain are the cold sweat, the trembling in my hands, and that emptiness inside me that nothing can fill. I stay like that, motionless, until the light of dawn dissolves the horror.

I wake up. It's past noon. I never sleep that long. Everything is strangely calm, as if nothing had happened. Everything smells clean, but not like home. As if someone had wanted to erase what had happened. I feel relaxed, light. I'd like to think it was just a nightmare. I walk down the hall. The living room. The patio. Everything is in its place. There's no fog. No strange lights. No sign of the monk. I convince myself that it was all a bad dream.

I go to the kitchen. I make myself a coffee with milk and some doughnuts. I love how the sugar melts in the coffee. But when I dip one in, I see my left hand: red marks, like pecking. The marks on my hand no longer hurt. But they are there. Like silent witnesses.

Then I remember. I pinched myself. I pulled my hair out. I threw myself on the floor.

It wasn't a dream.

All my energy is suddenly drained. As if someone had unplugged my soul. I stare at my coffee without tasting it. I don't finish the doughnuts. I leave the house.

I don't know if I'm running away or if someone is chasing me.

But as I walk down the empty street, with the taste of fear still in my throat, I feel them following me.

I don't hear them. I don't see them.

But I know they're there.
