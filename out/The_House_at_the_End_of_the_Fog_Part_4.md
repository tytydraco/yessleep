The scream that tore out of Emily’s throat—or what wore her face—still rang in my skull as I stumbled blind through the dark. My hands scraped walls slick with rot, my boots catching on warped boards.

When the bulb had burst, the darkness wasn’t just absence of light. It was heavy, pressing, alive. It breathed against my skin.

Then a sound cut through it.

A door creaking open. Low. Slow. Beckoning.

I followed it like a moth to a flame. My fingertips brushed along the wall until they found the edge of another frame, rough wood splintering under my touch. A draft blew through, colder than anything I’d felt yet.

I struck my lighter. The tiny flame shook with my trembling hand.

Stairs descended before me. Narrow, steep, each one slick with damp. The smell hit me like a hammer—putrid, choking. Rot layered on rot. Meat long spoiled. Rust. Feces.

Every instinct screamed to run. But my body… it wanted to go down.

The whispers returned, faint, shivering:

“Don’t follow.”

“Don’t look.”

“He keeps them.”

The lighter flickered, guttered, then steadied. I gripped it tighter, knowing it wouldn’t last long, and started down.

The boards groaned under my weight, soft as if swollen with water. Slime clung to my boots. I slipped once, catching myself on the wall—and my hand sank into something wet. My skin crawled as I yanked it back. The lighter’s glow showed my palm streaked with something dark, thick, and clotted.

I gagged, wiped it on my jeans, and kept moving.

The stairs ended in a dirt floor. The cellar stretched low and wide, its beams sagging under the weight of decades. Mason jars lined crooked shelves, filled with things that should never have been preserved—fingers, cloudy eyes, strips of flesh curling in yellow brine. Some still twitched faintly, as if life hadn’t quite let go.

In the far corner stood cages.

Three of them. Rusted bars, bent but unbroken. Chains bolted to the dirt, taut and stained.

And inside—

Bones.

Not clean skeletons. Not arranged. Just heaps. Ribs tangled with femurs, skulls gnawed and cracked open, spines still threaded with gristle. The lighter’s glow licked across them, and for a second I thought they moved. That the heap breathed.

A sound behind me.

Shuffling. Wet, dragging.

I spun, flame sputtering.

Something stepped into the light.

Not the man. Not the child-thing from under the table. This was worse.

Its body hunched, skin hanging in strips like molted bark. Its arms were too long, dragging against the ground, fingers hooked and raw. Its head tilted sideways, eyes milky, jaw slack.

It wore a face.

Not its own. Stretched across its skull, stitched crudely at the edges. A woman’s face, pale, lips split, eyes lifeless. I recognized it from the photo in the bedroom. The blurry woman beside me.

My stomach twisted so hard I doubled over. Bile spilled onto the dirt, steaming in the cold.

The thing shambled closer. Its sewn-on lips parted, and a voice spilled out—not its own. A chorus.

“Stay. Stay. Stay.”

The whispers in the walls shrieked all at once.

“Don’t let it see your eyes!”

I snuffed the lighter.

Darkness swallowed me whole again.

And in that darkness, I heard it scuttle. Faster now. Drool pattering onto dirt. Nails digging trenches as it searched.

My only thought: Hide.

I dropped to the floor, pressing into the filth, forcing myself silent as the stench filled me, coated me. The thing moved inches away, its wheezing breath rattling.

And then—its hand brushed my boot.

Its hand lingered on my boot. The weight of it wasn’t just physical — it pressed against me like recognition. Like it knew.

I froze, lungs locked, praying the pounding of my heart wouldn’t give me away.

The thing’s breath wheezed, wet and broken. Then it whispered.

My name.

Not once. Not loud. But again and again, soft as a lover crooning in the dark:

“Daniel… Daniel… Daniel…”

I almost screamed. Almost broke cover. Hearing my own name spill from that stitched mouth was worse than any shriek.

The whispers in the walls hissed furiously, urgent now:

“Don’t answer.”

“It can’t have you if you don’t answer.”

The thing dragged its nails across the dirt, gouging long furrows. I could feel the vibrations through the ground, buzzing up my bones. Then it tilted its head, sniffing, the sound sharp and wet.

“Daniel,” it crooned again. This time in a voice I knew.
Emily’s.

Tears burned my eyes. The thing moved closer, its stench unbearable, until I felt its breath on my cheek.

I snapped. I lit the lighter.

The sudden flame painted its face in orange horror. The stitched skin sagged, seams stretching, pus bubbling from the edges. But the worst was its grin. Wide. Knowing.

Behind the stolen face, something else grinned too. Rows of teeth pressing against the inside of the skin, ready to split it open.

I kicked. Hard. My boot connected with its jaw, snapping the head back. It let out a howl — not human, not animal. Something ancient, raw.

I scrambled to my feet, lighter trembling in my hand, eyes darting for escape. That’s when I saw it.

A door at the far end of the cellar. Narrow, half-buried in dirt.

The thing lunged.

I bolted. My shoulder clipped a shelf, jars tumbling, bursting across the ground. The stench doubled, tripled, as eyes rolled across my boots, fingers twitching in puddles of brine.

I slammed into the door. It stuck. I heaved, nails breaking as I clawed at it, and with a splintering crack, it swung open.

The space beyond wasn’t right.

Not stairs. Not another room.

A corridor of fog.

It stretched impossibly far, walls pulsing as though made of living flesh, lined with crooked doors that breathed faintly, opening and closing as if sighing.

Behind me, the thing roared, its body crashing against cages, bones snapping under its weight.

The whispers shrieked in unison:

“Don’t go in!”

“It’s worse in there!”

But then I heard it again.

My name.

This time, dozens of voices. Hundreds. Every door in the fog corridor whispering it at once, moaning it, gasping it, singing it. “Daniel… Daniel… Daniel…”

Each voice was different. Some were strangers. Some I knew. My mother. My father. Emily. Myself.

And threaded through them all — laughter. High, childlike, wrong.

The stitched thing behind me shrieked, so loud the beams rattled.

I had no choice.

I stepped into the corridor.

The door slammed shut behind me.

And all the voices hushed.

For the first time since entering the house, I was completely, utterly alone.

Or so I thought.

Then, from the nearest door, a fingernail scratched once, long and slow, like someone carving my name into the wood.
