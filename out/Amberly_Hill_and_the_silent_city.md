Our city was always quiet, it wasn’t the city to go for an event or for nightlife. It was more a conglomerate of people trailing back and forth on their quest up the corporate ladder.

It made for a boring life, but at a certain age I think that’s exactly what you’d hope for. Unfortunately for me, I’m not quite at that age yet. Being 18 in a city dedicated to the corporate life when you have little to no interest in it almost feels like a prison sentence. Having to walk down these concrete soulless streets, being enveloped by these towering buildings with countless minds trapped inside them, it’s not the type of thing that makes you want to do anything. 

But again, it’s at least a *safe* place for the most part, you never hear of anything going wrong. If anything it’s a little eerie, when there’s this many people around you’d expect something bad to happen every now and then. It’s not like I *want* something bad to happen, I just find it strange is all. 

Which is why when I heard of what had happened to Amberly I was caught off guard, but the tiniest part of me felt excited. I know it’s horrible, but hearing that someone from my area had disappeared? It felt like the lifeless routine had been broken.

“Disappeared?? How long has she been missing?” I said through a wince that tried to seem more concerned than excited.

“Her parents called in that she hadn’t returned home on Thursday night, so make that….5 days” Liam said with an uncertain look. “I don’t know if that constitutes as a disappearance, but I suppose no one knows where she is”. 

Although that guilty part of me found excitement in this, i felt a tight knot of anxiety that I hadn’t had to deal with before. I knew OF Amberly, we weren’t friends but she didn’t live too far from me. Plus Liam always spoke good of her. My brain having to create its own beauty in this dull life gave me license to overthink a little too much. Make the most out of the smallest of details. So you could imagine the hurdles my mind went through once I’d digested what Liam had told me.

I began to ramble with no particular conclusion in mind “Okay but- our area? Do you think we need to look for her? Or what if it’s a person- a group- anyone, do we work together or distance ourselves I mean I’m sure she’s fine but like you never kn-“ 

Liam cut me off with an unconvinced side eye “We obviously do nothing Alex, take a breath what’s wrong with you. It could be anything. She could just be out of town on a no contact run for a bit, could have rolled down a dodgy path or something I don’t know” 

Hes always been a bit more rational than me, which has been good most of the time keeping me away from ‘starting a new life’ or some other very unrealistic escapade.

“Well yeah but, isn’t your inner detective slightly concerned” I said with a half playful tone.

“I know her quite well, she’s a smart person I’m sure she’s okay.. I hope so anyways” Liam said with a genuine concern dwelling in his eyes. 

Me and Liam exchanged a few more words about Amberly and our mundane evenings, then went our separate ways. 

My mind was restless for the remainder of the evening. I’d walked around on those one note streets, everyone in their beige attire, adhering to their daily routines like they were on a conveyor belt. Me and Liam were the only two people in my area that really wanted to live a little, apparently Amberly too but I hadn’t had the chance to really talk with her about it. 

Even my family, my parents were born and raised here, as most were. No one ever really has a reason to leave, or ever wants to it seems. 

I don’t know *why* it’s that way. I didn’t go to school here, I was at a boarding school for the majority of my childhood. My parents being who they are didn’t have the time or desire to parent me properly, so I figure it was easier to offload me out of sight. 

Thats where I’d met Liam, I always figured it was why we stood out a bit here having a similar experience as kids. Or maybe we just don’t have the heart, it’s easy find reasons why you’re different if you don’t want to admit you have no passion. 

Maybe the education system here really got you excited to attack the corporate world and never let go. Feeds into the cities interests that way I suppose. 

I’m certain however, that Amberly grew up here, yet Liam was certain she was just like us, I don’t know why I never got around to sitting down with her for a bit to find out for myself. Maybe I will when she turns up. 

I tried talking about it with my family when I got back, but they seemed incredibly disinterested. They looked at me in a way that felt disgusted when I expressed my concern. I figured they were just busy as normal but the brief glances I’d catch off them made me think silence was the smartest route forward.

With less answers than I had before, I flopped onto my bed, drained from the day which was a foreign feeling for me. It was a restless night, but right before I was slipping into unconsciousness, I heard urgent buzzes ping off my phone. I opened it up, and across my lock-screen I saw Liams name.

“I need you to meet me tomorrow, there’s something here you need to read. And please for the love of god, don’t talk about Amberly to anyone.”
