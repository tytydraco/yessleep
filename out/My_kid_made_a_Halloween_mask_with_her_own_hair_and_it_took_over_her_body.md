I never thought I'd be sharing this story on Reddit, but I need to get it off my chest. It's been three months since that cursed Halloween night, and I still can't shake the horror of what happened to my little girl, Emily. I'm hoping that by writing this down, I might find some answers or at least some peace. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginning.

I'm a single dad, have been for the last five years since my wife passed away. Emily's all I've got, and I'd do anything to protect her. She just turned ten this year, and she's the spitting image of her mom – blonde hair, blue eyes, and a smile that could light up a room.

Emily's always been a creative kid. Give her some crayons and paper, and she'll spend hours lost in her own little world. But this year, as Halloween approached, her creativity took a turn that I never saw coming.

It all started about a month before Halloween. Emily and I were having our usual Saturday morning pancakes when she brought it up.

"Dad," she said, syrup dripping down her chin, "can we talk about Halloween?"

I smiled, passing her a napkin. "Sure thing, kiddo. What's on your mind?"

Her eyes lit up. "I want to make my own costume this year. Something really special."

Now, I'm not the most artistic guy in the world. My idea of arts and crafts is sticking a magnet on the fridge. But seeing the excitement in her eyes, how could I say no?

"That sounds like a great idea," I said. "Any thoughts on what you want to be?"

Emily scrunched up her nose, thinking hard. It's this little quirk she does that always reminds me of her mom. "I'm not sure yet," she admitted. "But I know I want a mask. A really cool one."

And so began our month-long Halloween project. Every evening after dinner, we'd sit at the kitchen table, surrounded by craft supplies. Emily would sketch out ideas, and I'd do my best to help bring them to life. We tried paper mache (disaster), plastic molds (even bigger disaster), and about a dozen other techniques we found on YouTube.

As the days ticked by, I could see Emily getting more and more frustrated. Nothing was turning out quite the way she wanted.

Then, two weeks before Halloween, we made a trip to the craft store. Emily was quiet as we walked through the aisles, her earlier excitement replaced by a sort of grim determination. That's when we stumbled upon the mask section.

There, sitting on a shelf, was a plain white mask. Just a basic face shape with holes for eyes and a mouth. Nothing special. But Emily's eyes lit up like it was Christmas morning.

"Dad, look!" she whispered, pointing at the mask. "It's perfect! We can decorate it ourselves!"

I didn't think much of it at the time. It was just a mask, after all. How wrong I was.

For the next two weeks, Emily spent every free moment working on her mask. She painted it with swirls of purple and black, added glitter around the eyes, and attached feathers along the edges. I had to admit, it was looking pretty cool.

But then, three days before Halloween, things took a turn.

I was in the kitchen making dinner when I heard Emily call out from her room. "Dad! Can you come here for a sec?"

When I walked in, I found her sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by craft supplies. In her hand was a pair of scissors, and on the floor next to her was a small pile of blonde hair.

"Emily!" I gasped. "Did you cut your hair?"

She nodded, grinning. "Just a little bit. I wanted to make the mask extra special."

I watched in stunned silence as she carefully glued the lock of hair onto the forehead of the mask. Something about it made my skin crawl, but I chalked it up to the shock of seeing her cut her own hair.

"There!" she said, holding up the mask. "Now it's perfect."

As I looked at the mask, with its swirls of color and that lock of real hair, a chill ran down my spine. Something about it felt... wrong. But I pushed the feeling aside. It was just a Halloween mask, right?

That night, as I tucked Emily into bed, I noticed her staring at the mask on her dresser. There was something different about her expression, something I couldn't quite put my finger on.

"You okay, sweetie?" I asked.

She turned to me, smiling. "Yeah, Dad. I'm just excited for Halloween."

I kissed her forehead and turned off the light. As I closed her door, I could have sworn I saw the mask's eyes glint in the darkness. But that was impossible. It was just a mask... wasn't it?

I wish I could say that was the end of it. That Emily wore her mask on Halloween, had a great time trick-or-treating, and everything went back to normal. But that's not how this story goes. Not even close.

The night before Halloween, I woke up to a strange sound. It was like a whisper, but not quite. More like the rustle of leaves in the wind, but we live in an apartment on the fifth floor. I lay there in the dark, my heart pounding, trying to figure out what I was hearing.

Then I realized it was coming from Emily's room.

I got up, my bare feet silent on the cold floor. As I approached her door, the sound got clearer. It wasn't leaves. It was... giggling? But not Emily's giggle. This was higher, almost squeaky, like something from a cartoon.

I pushed open her door, expecting to find her awake, maybe watching videos on her tablet. Instead, I found her fast asleep, curled up under her blankets. The giggling stopped the moment I entered the room.

That's when I saw it. The mask. It was on her dresser where she'd left it, but something was... different. In the dim light from the hallway, I could have sworn the painted mouth was curved into a smile. A smile it definitely didn't have before.

I shook my head, blaming it on my sleepy brain playing tricks on me. I was about to leave when Emily stirred.

"Daddy?" she mumbled, her eyes still closed.

"It's okay, sweetie," I whispered. "Go back to sleep."

But she didn't. Instead, her eyes snapped open, and for a split second, I saw something that made my blood run cold. Her eyes, usually a soft blue, looked almost black in the darkness. And they weren't looking at me. They were fixed on the mask.

Then she blinked, and everything was normal again. "What's wrong, Dad?" she asked, her voice thick with sleep.

I forced a smile. "Nothing, honey. I just thought I heard something. Go back to sleep."

As I closed her door, I heard that giggle again. But this time, it sounded like it was coming from inside the room.

Halloween morning arrived, and Emily was bouncing off the walls with excitement. She insisted on putting on her costume right after breakfast, even though trick-or-treating was hours away.

"Can I wear my mask now, Dad? Please?" she begged.

Something in my gut screamed no, but I couldn't think of a good reason to refuse. "Okay, but just for a little while. You don't want to get tired of it before the big night."

The moment she put on the mask, the temperature in the room seemed to drop. Emily stood there, completely still, for what felt like an eternity. When she finally turned to face me, I had to stifle a gasp.

The mask looked... alive. The painted swirls seemed to shimmer and move, and the lock of hair on the forehead was swaying gently, even though there was no breeze in the room.

"How do I look, Daddy?" Emily's voice came out muffled and strange from behind the mask.

"Great, sweetie," I managed to choke out. "Why don't you take it off now? Save it for later?"

But Emily didn't move. She just stood there, staring at me through those painted eyes. Then, slowly, she raised her hand and stroked the hair on the mask's forehead.

"But Daddy," she said, her voice suddenly deeper, almost adult-like, "I don't want to take it off. Ever."

That's when I knew. Something was terribly, terribly wrong. And it was only going to get worse.

I tried to convince myself it was just Emily playing a Halloween prank. Kids do that, right? But deep down, I knew this was something else. Something worse.

As the day wore on, Emily refused to take off the mask. She barely spoke, and when she did, it was in that unnaturally deep voice that made my skin crawl. I tried to get her to eat lunch, but she just sat there, staring at the plate through those painted eyes.

By late afternoon, I was at my wit's end. "Emily," I said, trying to keep my voice calm, "it's almost time to go trick-or-treating. Why don't you take off the mask for a bit? Give your face a break?"

She turned to me, moving her head in a way that was just... wrong. Too smooth, like a doll being posed. "No," she said, that adult voice sending chills down my spine. "The mask stays on."

I reached out to take it off myself, but the moment my fingers touched the edge, pain shot through my hand like I'd been burned. I yanked my hand back with a yelp, staring in horror at the angry red marks on my fingertips.

Emily giggled, but it wasn't her giggle. It was that high-pitched sound I'd heard the night before. "Silly Daddy," she said, "the mask doesn't want to come off."

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. "Emily," I said, my voice shaking, "what's happening to you?"

She cocked her head to the side, an unnatural angle that made my stomach lurch. "Emily's not here right now," she said, and I swear I saw the mask's mouth move as she spoke. "But don't worry, Daddy. Soon, there won't be any Emily left at all."

I stumbled backward, my mind reeling. This couldn't be happening. It had to be a nightmare. But the pain in my hand told me it was all too real.

I ran to the phone, dialing 911 with trembling fingers. But before I could hit call, the lights in the apartment flickered and died. In the sudden darkness, I heard that giggle again, closer now.

"Who are you?" I shouted into the darkness. "What do you want with my daughter?"

The giggle turned into a laugh, a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. "Want?" the voice said, no longer pretending to be Emily. "I want what every lonely spirit wants. A body to call my own."

A flash of lightning illuminated the room for a split second, and I saw her. Emily – or what used to be Emily – standing in the doorway. The mask had... changed. The painted swirls were moving, twisting across its surface like living things. The lock of hair had grown, cascading down over Emily's shoulders.

But the worst part was where the mask met Emily's skin. I could see tendrils, like roots or veins, spreading from the edges of the mask, burrowing into my daughter's flesh.

"No," I whispered, horror and despair threatening to overwhelm me. "Please, no."

The thing wearing my daughter's body took a step forward. "Oh yes, Daddy," it said, its voice a terrible mixture of Emily's and something ancient and evil. "And guess what? There's room for two in here."

As it lunged towards me, mask-first, I realized with sickening clarity that this Halloween night was far from over. And that the real horror was just beginning.

I don't remember much of what happened next. It's all a blur of terror and desperation. I remember running, stumbling through the dark apartment, the thing that used to be my daughter always just a step behind. I remember the sound of its laughter, a horrible mix of Emily's voice and something ancient and evil.

At some point, I found myself in the kitchen. As lightning flashed outside, I saw a gleam of metal. Scissors. The same ones Emily had used to cut her hair for the mask. I grabbed them just as the thing lunged at me again.

What followed was the most horrifying moment of my life. I fought against the creature wearing my daughter's body, trying desperately to cut away the mask without hurting Emily. But every time the scissors touched the mask, it seemed to grow, those root-like tendrils spreading further across Emily's face.

"You can't save her," the thing hissed, its voice a nightmarish blend of Emily's and something inhuman. "She's mine now. And soon, you will be too."

In that moment, as I looked into the painted eyes of the mask, I saw something that chilled me to my very soul. Behind those eyes, in the depths I couldn't explain, I saw Emily. My little girl, trapped and terrified, silently screaming for help.

Something in me snapped. With a roar of rage and fear, I tackled the creature to the ground. We struggled, rolling across the floor, knocking over furniture. I could feel the mask trying to attach itself to me, those tendrils seeking my skin. The pain was excruciating, like a thousand needles stabbing into me all at once.

But I didn't let go. I couldn't. This was for Emily.

In a final, desperate move, I managed to get my fingers under the edge of the mask. The pain was blinding, but I held on, pulling with all my might. I heard a sound like tearing flesh, felt something give way.

And then, suddenly, it was over.

The mask came free in my hands, writhing and twisting like a living thing. Without thinking, I threw it into the fireplace and lit a match. The mask seemed to scream as the flames engulfed it, the painted swirls melting and bubbling, the lock of hair curling and blackening.

In moments, it was nothing but ash.

I turned to find Emily lying on the floor, unconscious but breathing. Her face was covered in angry red marks where the mask had attached itself, but she was alive. She was my Emily again.

That was three months ago. Emily's recovering, slowly but surely. The marks on her face are fading, but I fear the scars on her mind will take much longer to heal. She doesn't remember much of what happened, and part of me is grateful for that.

But sometimes, late at night, I hear her whimpering in her sleep. And when I go to comfort her, I see her hands moving, as if trying to pull something off her face.

As for me, well, I haven't slept properly since that night. Every time I close my eyes, I see that mask. I feel those tendrils trying to burrow into my skin. And I hear that laugh, that terrible laugh that wasn't quite Emily's.

I know it's over. I know I burned the mask. But sometimes, when I look in the mirror, I swear I see something moving just beneath my skin. And in my darkest moments, I wonder...

Did I really destroy the mask? Or is it just waiting, biding its time, ready to emerge once again?

I pray I never have to find out. But this Halloween, we're keeping the lights on. And there will be no masks in this house. Not ever again.
