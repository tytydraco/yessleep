Back when I was a kid, our village was not as developed in terms of infrastructure. One thing you need to know about people from the rural south is that they're extremely religious and have ceremonies for all sorts of things. This is important for context

On one of these festival weeks we decided to visit the old temples for prayers. The road there wound round a hill and went pretty deep into the forest. This coupled with it being monsoon season meant we took an easy 3 hours to get there. One thing about monsoon in India is that bizarrely some villages get rains more than the others. Even if they're a few kilometres apart. So we went from a lightly cloudy village to something straight out of Twilight. We could barely see the road ahead of us

The driver somehow took a wrong turn (I still don't know how - most hilly roads are one-way) and we ended up even deeper in the forest. Keep in mind it's so dark we thought it was evening, despite it being early afternoon

We found a few houses there and the driver decided to ask around for directions. No dice, all of them were abandoned. But weirdly they seemed well-kept. Okay, maybe the residents have gone to some festival ceremony. But from this deep in the forest? Plus, this was before Google maps so our GPS didn't have a stable network

Driver decides to try his luck through this settlement. My parents are getting increasingly worried as timing is important in rituals. I'm at the back starving, pre-ritual breakfasts are ass

The road gets increasingly shabby but the driver pushes through. I noticed the trees were slowly.. looking decayed. Like they were dark brown and the leaves were drooping low. I also noticed a distinct lack of birds (I was from the city so country birds were special to me).

Then we just.. hear a noise. Like a whistling- singing combo. Keep in mind this is a hilly forest so maybe it's the wind, maybe it's the forest itself. It's been years but I remember that sound. My parents are now scared that there's a large animal stalking us. Unlike Americans, we couldn't carry arms.

My dad urges the driver to turn back but he says he knows the road from here (a blatant lie), he could drive us out. Besides going back meant losing fuel. The sound gets softer and louder, and at times seems like it's coming from the car itself. And then we.. see weird shit. I don't remember it exactly since I was a kid but it seemed like things were dangling from the trees overhead. Dilapidated things. It's dark so I was told its monkeys but we have absolutely no idea at that point. I remember my head hurting really bad.

The driver eventually found his way out but looked worried. We ditched the temples idea and drove home. He stopped by a cafe for chai and asked around in our native language. I found out years later that we had driven through a black magic area of the forest. A place where practitioners congregate to perform old rituals, things our culture finds dangerous. Apparently we were the first ones to go through that area, most locals stayed away.

Look, a lot of it was rumors but we couldn't understand how there was an entire road through it. The locals said the usual "the forest is alive, give it respect" but how could the forest magically conjure a road through it? Plus if there was a road, wouldn't the government have gone through the area and fixed it up? Also I was told the sound was spirits trying to entice us to leave the road or stop

Our family living there moved so now we don't go to that village but I remember it being a famous legend in the area, which my parents didn't know as they were from the city. I think they expanded the roads there later
