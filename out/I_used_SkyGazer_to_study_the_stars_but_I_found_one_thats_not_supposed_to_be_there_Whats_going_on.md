Hey there, star lovers, it's Stella. You all know about my obsession with the stars, right? Well, let me tell you about this incredible find – the 'SkyGazer'. 

It's like having a pocket-sized gateway to the stars. Just open the app, turn on your camera, point your phone skyward, and voilà! The app maps out constellations and stars right where they are in the sky, tailored to your location on Earth. 

And the best part? It shows every star, even those hidden by city lights or annoying clouds, shining exactly as they would on a perfect, pollution-free night.

Now, here's the really awesome bit: tap on any star or constellation, and you're in for stories and myths. Users can even add their own narratives or short videos, making each celestial body a unique storyteller. Amazing, isn’t it?

So, there I was one night, lost in the stars, tapping away at constellations, in full-on nerd mode, when I spotted it – this one star. It was flickering in a dim, blue light, so faint I could barely make it out. 

My brain was all fired up. I knew this part of the sky, next to the Aquila in the Milky Way band, and there was definitely no star supposed to be at this exact spot. Maybe it was a plane or something? I whipped out the app for a quick reality check. And to my shock: the app actually recognized this star. There was even a new video uploaded about it.

I tapped on the video, my curiosity getting the better of me. It started with a low, droning hum against a screen flickering like snowflakes in a winter storm. But then, the hum intensified, morphing into a loud, piercing screech that grated against my ears. It was like nails on a chalkboard but worse, sending a wave of discomfort through me.

Suddenly, I was hit with a wave of dizziness and nausea, an indescribable sick feeling. It was as if the sound from the video was physically affecting me, twisting my insides. I couldn't handle it – it was too much. In a reflex of self-preservation, I hastily turned off the video and threw my phone aside, trying to escape that horrid noise.

After a few moments, when my head stopped spinning and my stomach settled, I cautiously picked up my phone again. I needed to know more about this bizarre video. My plan was to give it a thousand thumbs down and find out who uploaded this nightmare. But when I checked for the source, my blood ran cold. The screen just read 'Source: Unknown'. No user name, no traceable link, nothing. It was as if the video just materialized out of thin air. A chill ran down my spine. What on earth had I stumbled upon?

That night, sleep was hard to come by. The eerie aftereffect of that video just wouldn't leave my mind. After God knows how long, I finally started to feel my consciousness drifting away under exhaustion, and I started to see...and feel...things...

An image of striking plants floating into my blurry vision, a mix of purple and blue, sprouting from the ground. A peaceful, soothing scent flooded my nostrils. Creatures with three eyes and countless tiny legs, moving gracefully across a dark maroon desert under a deep purple sky.

Soon, a small village began to pop up on a hill, growing rapidly into a bustling town, and within a blink of an eye, turning into a futuristic city with glowing neon signs. Caterpillar cocoon-shaped flying objects soared into the sky, leaving bright trails in their wake. 

Then, all of a sudden, the peaceful scene was shattered by a huge explosion. The deep purple sky lit up by massive mushroom clouds everywhere. Massive flying cocoons crashed into each other, raining debris on the city below. 

A few small capsules ascended into space, leaving a sea of eye-blinding flames and sorrowful wails behind. The wails transformed into the sharp, haunting screech just like the devastating noise from the video. 

I covered my ears, but the screech kept seeping through, and all of a sudden, I understood what it said, an echoing 'help... us...'

I startled up suddenly, my heart pounding, covered in sweat. What the hell just happened?! I hastily reached for my phone, searching for that strange video again, but it was nowhere to be found. I rushed to the window, pointing my phone to where that mysterious star had been. But there was nothing there, just the empty night sky, wind howling through the window sill in the deep winter chill.

After that bizarre night, I needed to share my story with someone who might get it. I posted everything on an astronomy forum, looking for answers or belief. But no dice – I got brushed off or joked about. Even the local news folks thought I was nuts when I reached out. But despite their doubts, I knew what I'd seen was real.

Now, night after night, I point the SkyGazer to the stars, ever searching and hoping. This relentless quest for answers has become an instinctive part of me. I can't dismiss what I witnessed. As I look up into the endless expanse, I ponder if others are out there, across this vast cosmos, pointing their devices at us as well.
