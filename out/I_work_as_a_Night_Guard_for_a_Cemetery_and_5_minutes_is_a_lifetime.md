Now here is Part 9

I was fortunate to get a week off from work because Isaac is going to be taking a month off to go and travel. It was a nice recharge before I started working more to cover for Isaac. He has adopted the role of the Night Guard Dad since Eli retired. A role that suited Eli perfectly and Isaac equally as well.

Before Isaac sets off on his taste of retirement, we have a couple of shifts together so I can learn some of the responsibilities he usually handles. Kyle knows how to do it but has proven to push off the minutiae of paperwork onto more tech-savvy people.

His level of tech-know-how involves connecting his phone to Bluetooth speakers to play highly inappropriate music in social situations. When he was a kid he played Trap Queen and Black and Yellow at a funeral and nearly got throttled by some very angry attendees.

There is very little crime in my small town, other than trespassing into cemeteries at night, it is one of the small blessings that can come with small town life. When trouble rolls into town it is usually quickly identified and the trouble is chased out or the trouble is converted to a member of the town.

Working in the cemetery as a night guard I miss a lot of the night life of the town. Because of this I usually miss out on Open Mic at Charlie's Tavern, Paulie's Pinball andPoker night at The Beer Barn, and my biggest missed opportunity is Andrew's Buffalo Wing Eat Off which always seems to fall on the nights I have to work. Something I had been practicing for throughout my 20s long before hearing about it a few years ago.

Isaac and I had spent a quiet night checking the gates, listening to stories, and playing checkers with Captain Iche picking pieces of charred flesh off of his body and flicking them at the board in annoyed boredom when he stopped mid flick and scurried off towards the fountain.

I gave Isaac a look of if we should follow him, and he jumped over my last piece and ushered me to lead the way. As we neared the fountain we didn't see any spirits or trace of living intruders and split off to see what was wrong.

Bruiser hadn't earned an honest dollar since he was 12. His parents told him that if he wanted that new bike he was going to have to earn it with his own money. Bruiser decided that he would sell his Pokémon cards and unopened packs to the neighborhood kids to try and earn the money. His collection lightened and an extra $200 in his pocket, he learned kids would pay top dollar for rare cards and most importantly unopened packs.

He knew the best place to swipe packs of cards was at Mr. Jenkins Pharmacy. Mr. Jenkins was a dirty old man that liked to peak down the loose blouses of the women that needed prescriptions filled and that while he was busy getting an eye full, the cards were left unguarded long enough for Bruiser to stash a dozen or two packs into his underwear before buying a moon pie and RC cola to avoid future unwanted attention.

With careful fingers and plenty of superglue, Bruiser would open the packs, take out the good cards, and reseal the packs with Commons.

This was the start of a series of scams that Bruiser would run, by the time he was in high school he had expanded from running scams to full on bullying the smaller students. The one thing everyone could agree on about Bruiser was that he was a big boy that was smarter than is oafish size made him appear.

His two yes men, Needles and Belch always followed in lock step to his every hussle and late night B&E and they always managed to just avoid detection. From a malfunctioning security camera to the residents of a household spending the weekend out of town, the town blessed him with little miracles.

That was until another 17-year-old in his class brought up the Midnight Run. Bruiser, never the coward, snuck in to the cemetery with a worried Belch and a terrified Needles. While in the cemetery, the remained quiet despite the many spirits lurking the grounds. Likely, due to the fear that had caused the three to all fill their jockeys full of shit. Then when a sly Regent told them about a precious heirloom inside his family's mausoleum, Bruiser led his croneys to the mausoleum to break in for what they were told was worth millions.

When the Night Guard spotted them trying to break the lock of the mausoleum, it was by shear dumb luck that Belch and Needles were able to drag Bruiser away from the stashed treasure and escape the cemetery.

Full of rage at being forced to abandon his treasure, Bruiser beat Belch and Needles to two bloody husks when they had finally stopped outside of Mr. Jenkin's Pharmacy. This time there was no malfunction with the cameras, and no way for Bruiser to avoid the consequences that had eluded him for five years.

Needles, who was forever known after the incident as Stammering Stan, had suffered a brain bleed and was never able to talk without stuttering through every word. Belch, had been mockingly called Wolbeling Walter as his broken leg had left him with a permanent limp and the head trauma had diminished his speech to monosyllabic words.

For his part in the brutality, Bruiser found himself in a state penitentiary for thirty years. Locked up, Bruiser who had always been a big boy pushing around those smaller and weaker than him, had a chance to know what it was like to have someone bigger and meaner than him tell him what to do.

Despite the time locked up, Bruiser never forgot about that secret treasure stashed away in the Regent Family Mausoleum. Thirty years after his potential millions slipped through his fingers, he returned to the cemetery to claim what he believed was rightfully his.

I had walked south from the Fountain as Isaac went north. We had done our last gate check at 5am so all that would be left was to unlock the gates at 6. Seeing no one I began to make my way to the south gate when Mad Michael appeared before me and told me to follow him to Isaac.

No one was going to keep Bruiser from his treasure. Not the shitheads he called friends when he was 17, not some old night guard shining a flashlight at him with a confused look on his face.

Mad Michael floated ahead of me while I ran towards the sound of angry screaming coming from the Regent mausoleum. Something was wrong, the voice did not sound like Isaac, but it didn't sound like the screaming of the spirits either.

If some old fuck thought he was going to get is wrinkly hands on Bruiser's treasure, he had another thing coming. Bruiser tightened his grip on the crowbar and lifted it above his head, the startled guard dropped his flashlight to the ground and lifted his hands above his head.

Fire burned in my lungs as my feet pushed off of the asphalt road. My hands clenched around my flashlight, panic flooding over my body.

The crowbar came down with a cushioned thunk off of the old man's head. Dropping him to the ground in a solid blow. Thirty years of fighting off bigger brutes and many times failing to fight them off had hardened his muscles. The next swing broke the lock off the mausoleum allowing the gates to swing open. Regent and Captain Icher smiled wide as Bruiser stepped inside of the mausoleum.

There I found the source of the screaming. A demented man was screaming in rage inside of an empty mausoleum as Regent and Captain Icher tore his body apart. The man's eyes locked on mine as the burning antlers split his belly open.

Empty, nothing but long since buried bodies with nothing of value inside. The sight made Bruiser scream out in rage as a flurry of slurs and curses spilled from his mouth just as Regent wrapped his rope around Bruiser's neck.

I carried Issaac to the North Gate, hoping beyond hope that there was still time to help him. I glanced at my watch and saw the time. 5:55am it still wasn't time to unlock the gate.

A congregation of spirits encircled around me, encouraging me to unlock the gate and save my friend. There might still be time to rush him to the hospital, but waiting wasn't going to help him.

5:56am. Tears washed from my eyes as I looked down at Isaac, I began to reach for my keys when his hand lifted up and fell onto my hand gripping the keys. He gave a weak shake of his head back and forth. The cheering to unlock the gate grew louder.

5:57am. I gripped the keys harder, feeling the metal dig into my palm as frustration whitened the knuckles of my fist. Isaac's soft grip began to loosen before I let go of the keys and gently squeezed his hand. Thousands of voices told me that if I didn't hurry, Isaac was surely going to die.

5:58am. Isaac looked at me with glossy eyes, the light fading from them as he gave a weak smile. Waves of muttering about my failure to protect my friend echoed in my ears. Jeering and hissing comments about my cowardice. About letting someone die despite being able to unlock the gate and rush to help.

5:59:00.238am.
“You have to unlock the gate, every second counts and you're wasting minutes”

5:59:13.624am.
“We get another victim of the cemetery and we didn't even have to kill him ourselves”

5:59:27.829am.
“You might as well tell him goodbye now, that way you can join him in death”

5:59:41.555am.
“Can you believe someone snuck in here just to kill a worthless night guard.”
“If it was that easy I would have told more of those kids to do it”
The roaring voices deafening all sound around me.

5:59:59.999am.
“I'm so proud of you,” Isaac whispered, his breath labored and exhausted. His eyes rolled back as the words left his mouth while the Voices screamed all around.

6:00am. 

SILENCE

I slammed the key into the gate and threw it open. I lifted Isaac to my car and dropped the seat back before rushing to the driver side. I sled off making brief eye contact with the cemetery director. Words were not needed.

6:02am. My car screeched onto the main road and I ran a red light nearly getting sideswiped by a BMW. My foot slammed on the gas pedal as I raced towards a glimmer of hope.

6:06am. I jumped the curb and narrowly avoided hitting a parked ambulance. I jumped from the car, almost forgetting to put it in park. I cleared the hood of my car and threw the passenger door open, lifting Isaac up with the last of my adrenaline fueled strength.

6:08am. I watched the nurses rush Isaac off, their faces grim with doubt.

11:10am. I sat in the waiting room with bated breath. A prayer to a God I stopped believing in decades ago. Kyle, Thomas, Jacob and the Cemetery Director all around me making their own prayers for Isaac.

1:03pm. The doctor approached us, face sunken with hands nervously fiddling with each other.

Isaac had died, the blow with a crowbar had proved fatal. They did everything they could but he had been brain dead before I had arrived at the hospital. There was nothing that could have been done.

If I had only gotten there a few minutes earlier he might have survived.

But in the end Isaac wouldn't let me unlock the gates early.

Because in the end…

…The Voices Inside Want Out.
