A couple of weeks ago I saw an advertisement online for a house sitting job, it was 200 dollars for a single night. This seemed like an easy enough job, I wasn’t short on cash but 200 dollars for such a minuscule task was too good to pass up. I sent the poster a DM and I got the job. He sent me his address, it was on reservation land in a small collection of houses. It was about an hour drive from where I lived. I had brought a toothbrush, some toothpaste, my phone, a charger, and my wallet. Just the bare essentials. When I arrived at the house I made sure to double check the address, it was a nice area, the house was reasonably large with a flat roof and a nice patio. It was a bit separated from the rest of the neighborhood by about 300 feet. I parked my truck in front of the house, an old red Toyota pickup I had gotten from my Grandfather when I was 16. While looking at the truck the homeowner came out of the house, catching me off guard. He was a short elderly gentleman with greying black hair, he looked around 70 or so. He said hello and beckoned me inside. I told him that I saw his Ad and was here to house sit, he looked confused for a moment and then laughed, “ah yes, I thought you’d have come later, I’m going to be gone until around 8:30 tomorrow morning, feel free to help yourself to anything in the house.” He paused and sat up. He walked over to his bedroom and then came back out into the living room. He handed me a box of incense, “lavender,” he said. “Just as a little gift, they smell very nice, I’d prefer you not light them in the house though.” I looked at him with a smile and thanked him. I wished him a nice night and he left shortly after.
By now it was about 5:30 PM, I started exploring the house, I’ll try to describe it to the best of my ability here; it was probably around 4000 square feet. The front door opened to an expansive living room with no television but lots of seating and a nice wood coffee table in the center. On the left was a small kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, stove, and a microwave that looked older than time itself. It had a small table with two chairs and no tablecloth. On the right of the living room was the main bathroom and next to that bathroom was a large walk in closet. To the right of the kitchen was a hallway that led into two small bedrooms with twin sized beds, I only went in once to explore that area and it was pretty dull. Now when you open the front door into the living room there is a wall, there are two doors on that wall and they both lead into the master bedroom, one is near the hallway and the other is near the closet. This is where he told me to sleep. Now these doors were interesting, not only were they half doors (two small doors that fit into one doorway) but the distance between them and the floor was pretty large, I want to say 3 inches off the ground, I couldn’t tell if it was a design choice or served some purpose, regardless this is important. In that master bedroom there are four paned windows that look like they hadn’t been opened in ages, they swing out into what they overlook; a tall grassland with the occasional pine tree cluster, it was beautiful. On the left there was a very small bathroom with only a toilet and a small sink, the door could be locked from the outside by the house key.
After my little exploration, at around 6:00 I decided to eat. I looked through the fridge and nothing really stood out, he had some bread, milk, a few different meats, exedera. I ended up making a few BLTs for dinner. It was at this point that I finally went on my phone and to my disappointment there was no service whatsoever, not even the “SOS” icon which was frustrating. I really just messed around with offline games until about 10:00 PM and then finally went to bed.
4:32 AM. I very vividly remember the time. It was dark outside and the only light in the room was faint moonlight and the alarm clock. I stirred and the incense box that the homeowner had given me rolled underneath the door to my right. It took me a second to register what just happened and I shot up instantly. I stared at the box. That was impossible. I had left it on the coffee table. Was someone in the house? 
I debated on what to do and ended up pushing it back underneath the door carefully. This was a test, if there was someone in the house they already knew I was in the room which is why they would’ve pushed the box under the door in the first place, they’d either leave, push the box back, or breach in and shoot me in the face. Nothing happened and I obviously couldn’t sleep now. I sat on the bed staring at the crack under the door.
4:55 AM and I’m still staring when I hear a faint noise behind me… breathing? I shoot around and it’s a dog. It’s a medium sized, black, hairy dog. It could have been a coyote but its fur suggested otherwise. Did the dog push the incense under the door? Wait how did it get in? It looked at me, neither of us moved, I had explored the whole house there was no dog. It looked unnatural in a way… like it was straining. Its mouth opened slightly revealing teeth that were… wrong. I tackled it, it made no sound, we thudded to the ground. It didn’t react. I put it in a rear naked choke and it went out cold. I moved it into the bathroom and locked it with the house key. I sat in the bed in a mix of confusion and fear. It was at this point in time that I noticed scratches on the windows, it looked like someone had scraped knives against the glass. Why? Was this a Strangers situation, was I being messed with just to be killed?
20 minutes had passed. What could I even do? I had to get to the car, my gun was in the car, hell I didn’t even need the gun I could just run, this wasn’t worth 200 dollars… did the old man know? Was this him? If I went out the window would- the incense was pushed back under the door. I stared at it for what seemed like forever. 
I leaned off the bed and reached for the box. A black cat ran out from under the bed, I recoiled instantly. Just like the dog, it sat and stared. Unlike the dog it seemed… predatory. 
It jumped at me, I ducked. I heard the thud behind me. I turned. It was… gone. “what the hell” I whispered. I got up out of bed completely and grabbed my phone, yes I’d call the police! No signal.
I sat on the bed and stared at the creamy white wall illuminated by the moonlight. I began to break down. Was I hallucinating? What was happening, this wasn’t a normal break in situation. I thought for a moment then remembered the bathroom! I could go out the bathroom window and get to the truck, get to my gun! But the “dog” was in the bathroom wasn’t it? I peeked under the door crack, actually the dog was not in the bathroom which was actually worse. How is that possible?
As I am laying belly down on the floor peeking into the bathroom, I heard a scratch on the window just a few feet away. I froze. After around thirty seconds I bolted up with my hands at waist height, there were more scratches but this time, to my horror they were on the inside. I looked around, then moved over to the window and  put my face up to the glass. It was cold. I felt something hit my foot, I jumped. It was the incense. “SH*T DUDE WHAT THE HELL!” I screamed.  This wasn’t an intruder, no normal person is feasibly capable of what was happening in that house. I ran over to the nightstand and ripped my wallet and car keys from the wood. I stuffed them hastily in my pocket and kicked down the bathroom door. Nothing in it, no trace of the “dog”. I climbed up on the toilet and ripped the mesh off the window, throwing it onto the ground behind me. It was tight, I might not fit. I took a deep breath and hoisted myself through the window, landing with a thud into the grass.
I collected my bearings, it was dark as hell but I was not by any means going to turn my phone light on. I began crouch walking through the grass towards the front of the house. “Come on, come on, come-“ my whispering was interrupted by a horrifying screeching sound followed by what must have been ten others. My hair stood up and I sprinted, I had never run so fast in my life.
I smacked into my truck and unlocked just the driver seat door. I clambered in and locked the door behind me. I opened the armrest and grabbed the gun, a Springfield Armory M1911 in .45 auto, I left it on my lap, I wasn’t convinced it would stop whoever… whatever, was after me. I started the car, I didn’t even turn the lights on I just backed up in the dark. I got into the main area of the neighborhood, more screeching from the grass in the distance. “PLEASE GOD OH PLEASE GOD,” I floored it. I sped 95 miles per hour out of the residential area and onto the main road.
I finally turned the lights on and constantly checked behind me on my way home. I made no stops and drove far over the legal limit the entire way. I still can’t wrap my head around it even now. By the time I got home it was 6:40 AM or so. I hastily unlocked the apartment door and triple locked it behind me, lock, chain, and bolt. My girlfriend walked out of our room, drowsy. “What the hell, I thought you were doing a thing,” she yawned.
I broke. I ran right to her and put her in a tight hug. She was surprised but embraced me shortly after.
I didn’t sleep the next night, or the one after. 
I had sent the old guy an email, I did not detail the events, just that I was unable to complete the task and that I was willing to compensate him for the broken bathroom window, he never responded.
Like I said it’s been a few weeks at this point. I’m unsure whether I’m safe or not. I still can’t explain the events of that night. I never called the police and I never heard back from the old man, everything has been normal since, but I think I’m done taking odd jobs now.
