Imagine you're trapped in a cage. You were forced into it by a mindless beast; it gleefully slammed the door behind you. It's a tiny cell, fit only for standing in place. The hutch is shrouded in darkness, your cries for help muffled by the void.

All you can do is rattle the bars and watch. Watch as the ghastly beast hijacks your mind, your body, your very soul. You watch the carnage it inflicts, the lives it destroys, and you pray you wake up, and it was all just a bad dream.

That's what it feels like. The change.

I don't remember the first time it happened too well, but I have flashes. Images of a wild pup tearing up the backyard and biting the head off the neighbor's cat.

My mother shares the same affliction as I. She taught me to subdue the urge and beat it into my accursed skull that it would never go away. She had a different outlook on it; it was as much a blessing as it was a blight on our blood.

*"With time and control it will be your greatest tool."* Was her personal mantra.

I've never thought of it that way. There were times during my teenage years when the urge simply became too much, and I would wander off into the woods so I wouldn't cause too much trouble. Jason was so confused but supportive during this time. I never told him the truth, who would ever believe it? 

Besides his folks gave me enough of a stink eye whenever I would come over. They had this ancient looking bloodhound that would slumber in the den. It's saggy flaps always perked up when I came over. He never stopped staring at me.

Jason always told me his family came from a long line of big game hunters, as if I couldn't tell from all the morbid trophies hanging in their den. Those beady doll eyes always looked down at us, snuffed out and stuffed. 

We went to college together, much to our parents' chagrin. By that time, I had almost completely suppressed the change. I could still feel the wolf gnawing at the knap of my neck, but I was starting to go months without the change.

Over the summer it all fell apart.

I was out jogging on the eve of the harvest moon; when I felt a sharp sting, and the world keeled over. I woke up in a hellish fever dream. Chained monstrosities were all around me, gnawing at the air in rabid fury. Some were still human, wearing tattered rags and begging for release.

I watched a few wolves get drugged and dragged away by men in gas masks. I didn't see where they went, but those double doors reeked of pain and death. I changed when they tried to sedate me, much to my captor's surprise. 

I tore through them, and found salvation. Or rather, salvation masquerading in the form of insidious indoctrination. It was almost fate, running into that towering man. He had a Southern drawl to his speech, and worshiped the beast within like a blessing from god. Had I not slipped away in the massacre that followed I have no doubt he would have turned his zealous rage upon me. 

On my journey home I reflected on my own part in the killings. It was like recalling a vivid dream, I could still taste the salty bitterness of their flesh as I scarfed it down. The scent of iron still clung to me as I drove home in a stolen jeep.

The vivid memory of fear bleeding out of men's eyes as they begged for mercy that never came. How quickly the light faded as they slumped over mid-consumption. I prayed to God this wasn't who I was now and told myself it was all just self-defense.

But a part of me had enjoyed it, the same part that had been angry at myself for getting into that mess to begin with. A nagging voice that said: "*You should have been more careful, now look where you are."* The voice was quiet now, a smug yet satisfied silence filled my head.

I drove back to the Cove I had always called home and collapsed into my mother's arms. She comforted me in her own way and said I finally understood the burden of the beast.

She was right. After that god awful experience, I looked at the change as a necessary evil. But during the blood moon, I had been a mindless animal lusting after fresh flesh. It had been with me my entire life but next to that newly changed degenerate, I looked like an amateur.

I began sneaking off to the woods near school, practicing my craft as it were. At first, I trained myself to endure the pain.

Every nerve in my body would fry and my skin burned like I had been dipped in lava as I shed my humanity. I would tear into my heaving chest and rip clumps of discarded tissue onto the forest bed. I felt my bones break and reassemble themselves in unnatural ways, it was like my body was terraforming itself.

After the first few nights of tearing myself apart, the pain began to subdue. It was still there, but it started to feel like a phantom numbness. 

Shifting the pain allowed me to focus on my other senses. The world is so much brighter through the eyes of the wolf. Every mundane object had this glare to it, and lights were blindingly sparkling. The scents of the woods were almost overwhelming, a wild mix of animal musk and vibrant greens.

With time I began to tell certain things apart. For example, the scent of wild nuts and berries is often a scurrying squirrel. A whiff of pungent, musky leaves? A prancing buck. So many smells, yet they all taste like chicken. 

It was all going swell, until Jason followed me into the woods one night.

He saw me bathe myself in moonlight and transform. I imagine it must have looked quite grueling to him. But honestly it felt great. Like taking a hot bath after a long day at work.

I didn't recognize him at first, he was just this lanky shadow looming in the tree line. My mind flashed back to the hunters wielding cattle prods, and I got a bit-defensive. 

By the time my canine-addled brain had recognized him, I had pinned him down and torn into his shoulders a bit. I let him go and took my embarrassed rage out on some oaks. When I awoke, I saw the damage I had wrought. Thick claw marks like a bear on a frenzy. 

I tracked down Jason; he was tossing and turning in his dorm, a makeshift bandage hastily strapped to his shoulder. My heart sunk as I watched him. Luckly his wounds didn't seem too deep, they had already begone to scab over and heal. 

When he woke up, we had a long talk about my affliction and how I had hidden it from him. I told him everything, including the nasty men I had butchered. I regaled the man I loved with a story of boundless slaughter.

Of limbs being cleaved off bodies.

Of heads being chomped and swallowed in one gulp.

Of the pained cries of chained monsters, begging for a crimson-soaked release.

His face grew pale when I described the atrocities but then he held me close and told me he loved me, and that nothing would ever change that. I believed him, I really did. 

Then he tried to kill me. 

It was a week after I told him the truth. Class had just let out and I was chatting with Abi and Barb on the way back to Romero Hall. The fall chill had already begun to set in, and the trees were a wonderous shade of yellow and red. It was Friday, and we were set for a long weekend. I felt my phone buzz in my jeans and saw a text from Jason.

**"Hey babe. Meet me outside the hall, trip to the cove? <3"**

I smiled and Abi peeked over my shoulder, punching my arm.

"Someone's got a date." She said in a sing-song tone. 

"Shut up." I said.  "It's our anniversary this weekend." I proudly proclaimed.

"A beach trip on your anniversary? You think he's proposing?" Barb asked bluntly. My face flushed, I'll admit that was the first thing I thought of as well. 

"Guess we'll see. Catch you guys later." I said and broke off, waving at them both as I rushed to meet Jason. As I ran, I heard Abi slide next to Barb and berate her for being so forward.

The front of the brick dorm was flooded with students, each huddled together like packs of grazing sheep. They were all gabbing away, each paying no mind to the other. I scanned the crowd and found Jason standing by that ancient rust bucket on four wheels he called his car.

I ran up to him and gave him a big hug; he stiffened in my embrace. I pulled back and noticed guilt stamped on his usually adorable mug.

"Something wrong?" I muttered. He smiled weakly as he pulled me in and reassured me all was well. We hopped into the car and it spurted to life, though it sounded like a dying mule. Then we were off.

The first thing I noticed on the long drive to Maine was how quiet Jason was. Usually he was a chatterbox, talking up a storm about the sights, what movies he was excited about coming up, how pumped he was about the next track meet.

But today he was uncomfortably silent. Pulling even a mild "Uh-huh" or a "Mhm" out of him was like yanking teeth with pilers. Eventually I gave up and chalked it up to nerves. Maybe Barb was right, and he was going to get down on one knee as soon as we arrived. 

In my head I pictured him fumbling in his pockets for the ring, panic quickly overtaking him as he stuttered "Would you marry me?" like an idiot. Then I would pounce on him, laughing like a loon as I said yes a thousand times over. That coping thought was a warm comfort to the chilly mood in the car. 

After a few hours we crossed the Raker's county borders, a heavy fog welcoming us home. Jason turned the high beams on, and the welcome sign popped into view. It was a rickety old wooden thing; numerous cracks and splinters chiseled into it over the years.

The paint was worn and weathered, yet still clearly read *"Welcome to Raker's Cove: The Gem of The East"* in mauve writing, a cheeky fisherman in a yellow bucket hat giving a tired thumbs up and a wink.  At the sight of home, I turned to Jason, who was tapping his free foot a mile a minute.

"You want to stop by your house first or mine?" I asked casually.

"Neither." he responded quick and curt. "I was thinking we hang out downtown a little then have a nightcap down at the beach." He suggested. The beach had been where we first met as kids, each daring the other to sneak into the old sea cave; calling each other chickens for flaking right at the entrance. I rested my head on his broad shoulders and smiled sweetly at him.

"Sounds like a plan." he didn't respond, and I couldn't help but notice his shoulder flinch at my touch. 

The downtown of Raker's is more like a beachfront strip mall. A line of shops and broken-down arcades that goes on for miles. We passed a bunch of old haunts like "Tom's Curios" and the "Ye Ol tavern" which was a glorified shack painted orange. We used to "sneak in" there every Friday night our senior year.

I say sneak but we would just waltz right in, I doubt the prune of a bartender gave a rat's ass about the drinking age. I once saw someone who looked at most ten drowning themselves in a pitcher of swill. To our right was the beach, white sand like a field of sodium.

There were spots of black strung around the sandbar, seaweed and flora the ocean had regurgitated back onto the shore. We used to spend the dog days of summer treading the sand searching for shells.

At the far end of the beach, the monolithic sea cave loomed over the town like a bleak beacon, birds circled its spiring top. We parked near that watchful peak; it seemed to blot out what little sun there was left this late in the day. 

We stretched out legs in the shade then walked the boardwalk hand-in-hand. Jay was finally starting to come to life a little, the soothing trip down memory lane was doing wonders for him. Above us the night sky started to settle in, but the boardwalk was still busting with life.

We window shopped a little, loitering in front of more than a few store fronts. In his free hand Jay was holding a picnic basket, which he kept eying nervously. I squeezed his hand reassuringly and he seemed to relax a little.

We passed a thrift shop with some delightful little trinkets in it and tucked away in the corner I saw a wedding dress. It looked gorgeous, and I immediately pictured myself walking down the aisle; Jay eagerly awaiting me in that baby blue tux he wore to our first real date. 

I pointed it out to him, trying to hide the excitement in my voice. 

"That's such a lovely gown, wouldn't you say?" I asked. He looked past me, the crimson soaking into his pale face giving him away. 

"Uh, yeah. It's very pretty." He spoke, his voice shaking a little. I wrapped myself around his arms, sighing deeply as I egged his embarrassment on.

"Wouldn't I look lovely in something like that? Surrounded by all our friends and family." I batted my eyes at him, brushing my golden mane out of my face. He averted my gaze and cleared his throat, quickening his pace as he wiggled out my grasp. 

"I'm starving." he suddenly said. "Let's grab a quick bite at Stryker's." He pointed out the ice cream joint a few doors down and hurried towards it. I stuffed down my wounded pride and hurried along, still convinced he was just nervous about proposing. 

Love makes you blind, I suppose.

I caught up to Jay, the door ringing as he opened it. He nearly let it close on me, then corrected his mistake. He gave me a sheepish look as I brushed past him, starting to get a tad miffed. The inside of *"Stryker's Marvelous Iced Cream Emporium"* was obscenely white.

The walls were pristine with neary a smudge of dust on them, and the pearl toned floor was so polished I could admire myself in them. The place was set up like an old-fashioned diner; rotating leather cushioned seats adorned the counter.

You could sit and eat, but there was really only elbow room. Standing behind the counter tending to large vats of ice cream was a whistling man wearing a smoak. He had long, frizzled hair that was gray and waspy. He was bald atop of his head and wore a little milkman's cap.

His idea of a joke I assumed.

He turned to face us, one of his eyes drifting ever so slightly to the left. They were a pale green, and when he smiled it looked like a dentist's wet dream. He licked his overtly chapped lips and swung his arms in the air in surprise. 

"Why I'll be the ill-gotten son of a milkman, I haven't seen you kids in ages." He sweetly sang. We walked up to the counter, giving a polite nod to Mr. Stryker. 

"Been up at school, sir." I said. 

"Oh, I bet you kids have been getting into all sorts of mischief there. Why I remember when you used to scutter around my shop like grubby little roaches." He laughed. I joined in, unease starting to settle in as I remembered why we hadn't been here in a while. Jay was looking out the window and scratching his arm. I nudged him and he jumped, nearly dropping the basket. 

"Yeah, we were real troublemakers." He muttered, a barely audible whisper. 

"Dude what's going on with you, you're acting super cagey." I asked.

"Nothing a little iced cream won't cure, I'm sure." Stryker interjected. Like a magician putting on a show he ducked under the counter, and we heard him hum as he prepared some cones. Jay was getting twitchy standing next to me, like ants had crawled up his ass. He picked at his shoulder a little and noted the concern in my eyes. 

"What." He barked at me, sharper than he meant to, I'm sure. I slipped my hand into his.

"It's ok. I know why you're being so weird-you don't have to worry." I said, giving him a loving peck on the cheek. His face flushed and he turned away, avoiding my gaze. His grip on the picnic basket tightened. He looked like he was about to say something when Stryker popped back up like a jack in the box. In his hands were two delicious looking cones. 

"Now for the young mister we got a crispy vanilla bean with extra sprinkles." he explained with a giddy twinkle in his eye. "And for the lovely young lady-" He handed me diabetes on a stick as he explained his crime. "-We have a double scoop PeanutButter rocky road with marshmallow chunks, with extra PB sauce and a gob of extra chunky dipped right on the top."

He wiped a little drool from his mouth as he described this atrocity. I put on a brave smile and took the cone. The heavy aroma of savory peanut oil wafted towards me, and my stomach yearned for it, I must admit. 

"Thank you, Mr. Stryker." He waved his hands dismissively.

"Oh child, think nothing of it. In fact, these cones are on the house, call it a homecoming gift. I'm just so pleased to see you two still sticking together like peas in a pod." His eyes widened as he leaned in.

"Why, is that the heavenly chime of wedding bells I hear?" He laughed. Jason forced a dry chuckled, his face turning beet red as he dug into his cone. I started to lead him out the door before Stryker annoyed him further.

He waved us out with a big old dopey grin plastered on his face. The door chimed open and we were greeted by the chilly night. We lingered outside the storefront for a moment, digging into our frozen treats.

Past the glob of PeanutButter that stuck to the roof of my mouth and left a slimy peanut taste as it slide down my gullet; the rocky road was quite good. I noticed it had this oddly familiar aftertaste to it, I couldn't quite place it though.

My train of thought was interrupted by Jay taking my hand and motioning towards the sand bar. The night crowd had begun to turn in for the night, and the full moon hung low in the sky. I felt peaceful staring up at that lunar giant. 

"Come on, there's a spot up ahead a little that'll be perfect." He said, a sly look creeping onto him. 

We raced up the beach, sand kicking up like dust devils nipping at our heels. Behind us stores shuttered for the evening; the town behind us growing dimmer, yet the stars above growing in their beauty. We found an even enough patch of sand, and Jay began to set up.

Wrapped up neatly in the basket was a beach blanket, and some bottles of wine and glass tumblers. There was another box he set aside next to the basket, and I pretended not to notice it, though my heart fluttered at the sight of it. He turned to me and set the wine aside. I slurped up the last of my ice cream and grinned.

"That was great. I love peanut butter." I said. Jay nodded, still scratching his shoulder.

"Yeah. One might say to an-unnatural degree." He muttered. He grabbed one of the wine bottles and the cork popped with a satisfying grunt. He grabbed two glasses and looked at me. 

"I'm sorry. I've been a bit much tonight. I'm just, I wanted tonight to be special and I feel like I'm blowing it." he sighed. I took his hands, they felt warmed than usual, and softly caressed his knuckles. 

"It's ok. Just say what you need to say." As he looked at me, I saw a flash of sorrow on him, but it quickly faded. He leaned over and kissed me, and I melted at the sensation. He grabbed the glasses and turned to the basket, fumbling for something.

While I waited for the wine I stared out to the sea. It was so calm that night, not a cloud in the sky just a trillion shinning eyes looking down at us. The largest bulb was the pregnant moon. There was a time when sitting under it would fill me with dread, and the ever-hounding urge.

Now I could enjoy this peaceful night, timid waves crawling to the shore and distant crickets performing a symphony for us. 

Jay cleared his throat and handed me a full glass of red wine. It smelled like fermented blackberry, with a slight metalic chaser. I gladly took the cup from him and he smiled, raising his glass and scooching closer to me. 

"I want to make a toast. To the best friend I ever had, the most beautiful woman I've ever known. I feel like I've been by your side my whole life. Hell, I practically have." He laughed. I giggled as I felt tears start to swell in my eyes. The glass shook in my hand I was so nervous.

"I know I've been weird lately, but since you told me about-you know." His shoulder twitched at the unspoken memory. "-I've been struggling with a decision. Looking at you now, I think I'm making the right one." He raised his glass.

"To you Tamara, my first great love." We clinked glass, the "first" part sweeping by me as I took a long gulp.

I felt the wine slide down my throat, and began coughing. The flavor was bitter and strong.

"Hell of a drink." I winced. Jay looked on unfazed. The change was subtle, but I could see it in his eyes. Before I could get another word out, I began a coughing fit.

My throat was on fire. It felt like I had swallowed liquid napalm. I could feel the vile liquid sear a path down my esophagus, I was clawing at my skin. I could feel it sink to my stomach like a hard stone; it was radiating agony throughout my body.

I opened my mouth to cry out but I just kept coughing, blood sputtering out with each heave. I painted the sand with crimson as I collapsed to the ground, a hacking mess of misery.

Jay stood up, his face a stone mask of disdain. He reached down into the tiny box he had brought and opened it. He fetched a small pouch and dumped into onto the ground next to me. I yelped and gagged as it lightly singed my hand.

The silver was potent, even as a pile of dust. Tears were streaming down my face as my insides tore themselves apart at the seams. I looked up at him; eyes blood red from choking. I tried to get up but the pain was unbearable.

He reached back into the box and pulled out foul smelling gun. He aimed it at me without a second thought. His hands were shaking, his neck tweaking as he aimed it at me. 

"I'm sorry about this." He said, his voice uneven yet stoic. "But when a beast bloodies its hands, you have to put it down." 

"P-please." I choked out, reaching out to him. I steadied myself as best I could, my every rapid breath like a dagger to my silver-lined lungs. Blood dribbled down my chin, and I tried to plead with him. That's when I felt cold steel club me against the face.

I returned to the sand, coughing up fresh blood. Even Jay looked surprised at how hard he struck me.  The gun was like a frightened child in his hands; it quivered like he hadn't touched it once in his life.

"Stay down. Don't make this harder than it needs to. The way you talked about EATING people, it made me sick. You really thought you could brag about how great human flesh tastes and I'd still want to touch you?!? Let alone look at your putrid face. I can't believe I blinded myself to seeing what you really are. A fucking mongrel." He spat at me. 

His words stung more than the bruise forming on my cheek. His eyes flashed ruby red with fury, and I heard the hammer click. I had only one shot to save myself, but to change now would be utter agony.

In a panic, I grabbed some bloodied sand from the ground and right before he fired, I threw it in his face. He gasped and stepped back, the gun firing wildly in the air. The shot meant for me danced around my mind as I focused on purging the poison from me.

Jay was groaning, grabbing his head as he desperately tried to wipe the dirt from his vision. I crawled through the sand, the scent of iron and salt all around me. In a desperate act I shoved my fingers down my throat, gagging on the taste of dry sand that came with them.

I could feel the bile within start to swell as the purge began. It burned like hellfire coming back up. I let loose a stream of sanguine fluid mixed with dissolved peanut butter and sparkling bits of dust. As I let loose the contents of my stomach, I could hear Jay muttering to himself; he had dropped the revolver in the commotion.

I stared at the growing puddle of filth in front of me, this sludge gifted to me by a man I thought loved me. Rage began to overtake me; how dare he do this to me?

He calls me a monster after all we had been through; I loathed the blood I had shed. I hadn't enjoyed the slaughter under the blood moon. 

But I would enjoy this. 

The change came upon me like a tsunami of passion, fueled by grief and a primal need for vengeance. I ripped the cloths from my back and tossed them like bloody rags to the floor. Clumps of skin came with them, my flesh tore like thin wrapping paper.

I felt no pain. Only malice.

I stood tall, steam from my burnt insides pouring out. I towered over Jay by at least two feet, a nice feat considering he was 6,4. He squinted at me, still blinking out the last of the sand, The gun was hanging from his grasp, his arm jerked forward, and it fell to the ground.

He looked at me with madness in his eyes, his face like a raging bull. He grasped his twitching shoulder, the only sound between us my rumbling growls.

I felt fantastic, the pain from the poisoned chalice had unleashed me. Jay's tweaking body stepped back, the veins in his neck strained. 

"Stay-back. You filthy animal, look at you." He spat. I heard him. I just didn't care as I advanced on him. 

"God stay back-" His voice was gruff and full of base, a far cry from a man about to be disemboweled. "Why-why does it itch so fucking much?!" He bellowed as he clawed at his arm.

His eyes left mine for only a sliver of a second, and I took the opportunity to pounce. I sunk my gluttonous jaws into his neck. I lifted him into the air like he was a bundle of sticks, and I did what any dog does with a new chew toy.

I shook.

He flailed around like a human ragdoll, arms uselessly striking my hide. Each blow felt weaker as blood spewed from his jugular. He tried kicking me, a pointless endeavor. I released my grip, and he flew onto the sand.

His mouth was agape like a drowning fish, a weak hand clasping his neck, desperately trying to keep the red from spilling any longer. I clomped towards him, claws extended. He couldn't get out a final breath as I leapt at him.

I began to tear into his chest, tunneling into him like a rabid dog. My talons were like knives, cutting through his tender tissue with ease. Every laceration felt like a shot of adrenaline, the inside of him began to look like a blended mess.

As I ripped and slashed, it felt like I was tearing apart every good memory I had of him.

Our first date dashed to ribbons.

Our first kiss a mauled kidney.

A future with him I had craved more than anything, dashed to bits like splattered brains.

I ravaged his body until I was satisfied, and when the mist cleared and I was standing there with viscera dripping from my claws; I could barely register the split open thing in front of me.

Parts of him were still convulsing, nerves shooting out their last painful orders. I didn't feel horrified at what I had done.

I was glad.

It was the first time in a long time I felt peace with what I am. I'd rather be this then a whimpering piece of meat begging for their life. At the very least, I could thank Jay for that.

I turned my head and howled at the moon. A triumphant cry, with a hint of mourning.

I did mourn him, despite the horror he had inflicted on me, despite the betrayal sticking in my heart like a dagger. I had adored him.

My first great love.

As the howling subdued, as the surge of energy started to fade, the residual silver began to take its toll. The world spun, and I fell to the ground, the world blacking out.

I awoke the next morning, my head pounding and throat tender. There was throbbing pain in my lower abdomen, the worst case of food poisoning I had ever had. I sat up on the soft bed I found myself in and took in my surroundings.

I was home.

I recognized ma's trinkets and baubles anywhere. I looked around, I had been dressed and wrapped in a fuzzy blanket. Blood still caked my face, and I winced as I touched the fading bruise on my face.

I heard a dish shatter and saw my mother standing there, a cigarette dripping from her quivering lips. She rushed me before I could say anything and showered me with hugs and kisses. 

"Oh, my *copil dulce*. I was so worried for you. You slept for hours after the change left, you were so pale, so still-" She was rambling, her face running with the remains of her makeup. She finally just let the dam flow and wept into my arms. I held her close and soon joined her. 

"It was Jason mama, he tried to-" She hushed me and put a boney finger to my lips. 

"Speak no more of the *rahat.* He is gone now." She uttered plainly. Panic began to set in, as I remembered the display I had left at the beach front. 

"Mama, the body; it's surely been discovered by now." I started to get up but she gently pushed me back down. There was a grave look in her eyes. 

"Mr. Stryker found you on the beach, he brought you to me. He found you engulfed in blood and fur. But you were alone." She left her words linger.

"That's-that's impossible." I sputtered out. She just shook her head sadly.

"The gift of the wolf can only be extinguished by silver or flame. Anything else, and the beast puts itself back together, though the worse the wound, the more the mind shatters." She said. My mind raced a thousand times a minute; *no, no how could he still be- I had never bitten him I-*

His shoulder.

*I had scratched it the week before.*

Ma then went to the little Tv she had on the counter, this old black and white eyesore.

"It's been on every station since this morning." She said as she flicked it on. The screen showed a static filled mess, but I recognized the outline of Lenny, the station's news caster. He was mid reporting as the tv flickered to life.

"-to the worst slaying in our quiet town's history. Authorities say the bodies were mangled beyond recognition and are having trouble reaching the next of kin." The screen switched to a live recording of a house that was cordoned off by police tape. My heart sunk as I recognized Jason's house.

He had gone home.

This was a few weeks ago now. I spent time recovering at home, glued to the tv for any news on Jason. They said his family looked like they had been slain by a pack of wild animals, the wounds so severe. Sheriff came by asking for me, was hoping I could give Jason an alibi. I had nothing to give him, and he went away grumbling.

They still haven't found his body. He's out there, somewhere deep in the woods lost to madness.

It's my fault, I should have known I passed it on to him. His family's blood is on my hands just as much as his.

I need to track him down and finish the job this time. I know he'll be waiting for me, the monster who tore him to pieces.

I will find him, and when I do, I'll make it quick and painless.

After that? I think I'll take a break from dating, save some other poor schmuck the fright of his girl sprouting hair and a tail. Having a werewolf girlfriend is way more trouble than it's worth.

Take my word for it.
