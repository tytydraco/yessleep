When I moved into Apartment 3B three months ago, the landlord gave me only one warning: "Mrs. Chen in 4B is... particular. If she knocks on your door after dark, whatever you do, don't smile at her."

I laughed it off. Just another eccentric neighbor story, I thought.

Mrs. Chen seemed normal enough during the day—a frail woman in her seventies who shuffled down the hallway with her shopping bags, always wearing a surgical mask. She never spoke, never made eye contact. The mask never came off, even inside the building.

But I started noticing things...

The walls in my bedroom shared a connection with her apartment, and some nights I'd hear... sounds. Not crying. Not exactly talking. It was like someone practicing different emotions in a mirror. A laugh. Then the same laugh, but slightly different. Then again. And again. For hours.

Two weeks ago, my neighbor across the hall moved out suddenly. When I asked the landlord why, he just shook his head. "She smiled."

Last night, I was up late working when I heard the knock.

Three soft taps..

I looked through the peephole. Mrs. Chen stood there, still wearing her mask, but something was different. Her eyes. They were too wide. Too excited.

I knew I shouldn't open the door. But she knocked again. Then again. Each knock more insistent.

"I know you're there," she said, her voice muffled behind the mask. "I can hear your heartbeat. It's smiling."

My heartbeat can't smile. That didn't make sense. But I felt it—my chest tightening with the instinct to grin, to laugh off the absurdity of it all.

The knocking stopped.

I waited

Then I heard it ..the sound of a key sliding into my lock.

She had a key.

The door opened slowly, and Mrs. Chen stepped inside. She moved differently now fluid, deliberate. The surgical mask obscured most of her face, but her eyes locked onto mine.

"You have a beautiful smile," she whispered. "I've been watching it. Through the walls. When you talk on the phone. When you watch television. It's perfect."

She reached up and pulled down her mask.

I wish I could forget what I saw.

Her mouth it wasn't one mouth. It was dozens of them, stitched together in a grotesque patchwork across her lower face. Young mouths. Old mouths. Thin lips. Full lips. All of them moving independently, each one wearing a different expression. Some were smiling. Some were screaming. Some were just... frozen.

"I've been collecting for forty years," she said, and all the mouths moved with her words, creating a horrible chorus. "But I'm missing something. Yours would complete my joy collection."

I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. Every instinct told me to run, but my body betrayed me. My face—God help me I felt my face pulling into a smile. Not because I wanted to. Because my muscles responded to some primal trigger, some nervous system override.

"Yes," she hissed, reaching toward me with skeletal fingers. "Give it to me."

I don't remember what happened next. When I came to, I was on the floor. Mrs. Chen was gone. My door was locked from the inside.

But something was wrong.

I went to the bathroom mirror.

My face looked normal. Same eyes. Same nose. Same mouth.

Except when I tried to smil really smile I couldn't. The muscles wouldn't respond. It was like that part of my face had been... turned off.

I touched my lips. They were cold. Numb.

That's when I noticed the thin surgical line along my jaw, so precise I'd almost missed it.

And from apartment 4B, I heard it: my laugh. My exact laugh. Playing on repeat.

She didn't take my smile.

She borrowed it.

And tonight, she knocked again. Three soft taps.

This time, she wants the rest.
