It was the year 2019, and I was working as a marine biologist, researching the depths of the Pacific Ocean. I had always been fascinated by the mysteries that lay beneath the waves, but nothing could have prepared me for what I discovered.

It was a routine expedition, and we were exploring an area that had never been seen before. As we delved deeper, our cameras picked up something unusual, and we moved in for a closer look. That's when we saw them - three beings, floating in the darkness, their bodies made completely of light. I couldn't believe my eyes - this was something that defied all explanation.

We brought the creatures to the surface, and I began to communicate with them. It was a surreal experience, but as we talked, they began to reveal something truly terrifying. They told me about a series of events that would unfold over the next ten years, events that would lead to the extinction of humanity. I was shaken to my core - how could this be possible?

The events began with the outbreak of a deadly virus in late 2019, one that spread rapidly across the globe, infecting millions of people. The virus was highly contagious and had a mortality rate of over 3%, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. It was the beginning of the end.

As the years went on, the events only became more terrifying. In 2020, wildfires ravaged Australia, causing widespread devastation and killing billions of animals. The following year, a massive explosion rocked Beirut, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. Then came the murder hornets, a species of hornet that had never been seen in North America before. They were ruthless, killing entire bee colonies and threatening our food supply.

The years continued to pass, and the events became more and more complex. In 2022, a massive iceberg broke off from Antarctica, leading to rising sea levels and the displacement of millions of people. In 2023, a deadly earthquake struck Japan, triggering a devastating tsunami that killed thousands. In 2024, a massive drought hit California, leading to water shortages and food insecurity.

But the worst was yet to come. In 2025, a massive asteroid struck the Earth, wiping out entire cities and killing billions of people. It was a cataclysmic event, one that would change the course of human history forever.

As the years passed, the events only became more terrifying. In 2026, a massive solar flare caused widespread power outages, leading to chaos and anarchy in many cities. In 2027, a deadly new strain of influenza emerged, killing millions of people and further weakening our already fragile global health system. And in 2028, climate change led to a massive melting of the polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise even further and leading to the displacement of even more people.

It was now the year 2029, and the world was a very different place from what it had been just ten years before. The events that the beings had predicted had come to pass, and humanity was on the brink of extinction. As I looked out at the world, I knew that there was nothing left to do but wait for the end to come.

And then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the beings were gone. They vanished into the ether, leaving behind only a sense of foreboding and a feeling of impending doom. As I looked out at the world, I knew that the end was near, and that there was nothing we could do to stop it. The only thing left to do was to wait, and to pray for a miracle that would never come.
