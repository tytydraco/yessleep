My life has been in a bit of stir recently. I’m a terrified scared reck. I only show up for work, and I think someone or.. something is out to get me.


I suppose I should preface this. I’m a 33 year old man, living by himself. I’m working as a mechanic, and there is nothing special about me at all. I barely completed college, and did nothing impressive, only barley managing to pass my mechanics classes. Both my parents died, with my mom dying after child birth, and my dad dying of lung cancer. I only have a dog to my name, Buddy, a golden retriever. But, since I was 13, I’ve had vivid dreams, always myself in different situations. Sometimes I’ve been a superhero, fighting monsters and winning. Sometimes, I was weak, and couldn’t fight back the monsters. Sometimes it was my normal life, but my car was purple. Whatever it may be, I have dreamed my entire life. 


There is a theory that your dreams are you subconsciously peaking into your other lives. Seeing yourself in different dimensions. It’s a fun idea, one which I choose to buy into. It’s a fun form of escapism to imagine that those dreams where I’m a movie star are real in a different reality. It’s usually the only thing I have to look forward too. 


Recently, for the past month, I would keep having dreams of myself dying. Now, this isn’t to say I’ve never dreamed myself dying. It’s usually the typical stuff, falling off a cliff, getting shot, getting nuked, stabbed, burnt, drowned, you name it. Every death imaginable, and I wake up, dull pain in my body every time. It’s slightly scary for a bit yeah, but I get back so sleep, and go to work the next day. But, recently it’s been getting darker. Being strangled. Being tortured. Being burned alive in rituals. It’s been malicious. I wake up each time, with a sense of impending dread.


I have dreamed almost every night since I was twelve. It’s been at least five times a week. After the last dream, where I was eaten alive by cannibals, I stopped dreaming. It’s been a month. I have not had a dream in a full calendar month. 


Ive become a shut in. I’m terrified. I think I’m the last version of myself alive. I also think I’m next. I think the universe is after me. I think there is some greater force at work, trying to end me, and erase me from the multiverse. Some evil guiding force, hell bent on destroying me. If I die, there will be nothing left of me. I have no wife. No friends. I barely support myself and my dog. All I ever had to look forward too was my dreams. Now they’re gone, and with them go my life. I will update soon if anything changes


If I don’t update in a month, then you know what happened. Remember my story. Remember me. Keep me alive in some way, please.
