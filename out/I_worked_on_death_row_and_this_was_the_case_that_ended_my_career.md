In the old days, those in my profession wore a mask. Some say that it's so no one comes for revenge. Others say that it was so God doesn't recognize it as a sin. Still, I have heard that it is so Death doesn't come for the wrong killer.

Long gone are the days of axes, and it has been almost 50 years since even France used a guillotine. Instead, in my home state, we prefer the electric chair. And I am the hand that pulls the lever. A modern day executioner.

What they don't often report on killing criminals, is the tow that is inflicted on those who sentenced them. The lawyers, the judge, the jury, and none more so than those who pull the lever. There's the guilt for some executioners. The toiling abyss, and uncertainty that plague some cases that aren't exactly cut and dry. And even the most die hard amongst us, never know when something will trigger our subconscious.

My colleague, Eddie Croquette, who pulled the big one over a mother who killed her two sons. She claimed they were demons. Because she only prayed for daughters. Had it happen to him. Pulling the lever on someone like that normally didn't keep any of us awake. But it was what the woman said while she was sitting there screaming as a hundred thousand jolts lit her nervous system up like a Christmas tree, that got him.

"It smells like cheeseburgers," he told me. "Before her body went limp. And sure. You know. There's a little smoke. But I thought that was that. Until a couple days later. Jane and the kids come home with some McDonalds. And I was fine when I ate a fry. Even had a bit of their milkshake. But when I started unwrapping one of the cheeseburgers. I suddenly smelled it. Of that that woman cooking. It crawled out of some cavity in my brain, and came out of my nose. I could even taste her in my mouth." He shakes his head, "I haven't been able to touch the stuff since."

Then there are the conferences. It started as a kind of support group. And after Leslie McNeal passed away. It kind of grew from there. Those who knew Leslie, said she wasn't the same after bringing it down on this Satanist that had been convicted in the tri-state area.

She had chosen Eddie as her alternate, who later confirmed that it was true. That a Satanist did indeed curse Leslie as he was dying. But it was after the fact, that caused the majority of the outrage from our community. When Leslie went to stop the juice, the electricity jumped and the amps became unstable.

See, there's a safety feature on the newer models. A light that warns the executioner if the leads are hot, meaning that the system's been overcharged and has caused the lever to be live. But most states still got them rinky dink ones built in the late 1800s, without any of the fail safes. Leslie's machine was one of those.

And so we originally gathered to levy our grievances after her accident. To get those in charge to make a much needed change. But most of our push back came in the form of threats. That they'd tear the entire program down and switch to lethal injections. Put us all out of work. So we kept our mouths shut publicly, in want of a $3.29 cent part I see often at hardware stores.

The lack of that part sent Leslie to the hospital. Putting her into a coma for 6 weeks. They also had to amputate her arm because of it. From the elbow, down.

And I personally believe that what she said after waking up, is why people believe she had been cursed.

It was Eddie and then committee leader Jo Jones who heard it from her own lips.

"I can feel it," she screamed. "Oh God. Jo. It's so scared!"

"What is," Jo demanded. Eddie said the two were nearly shouting by this time because Leslie was howling and spitting, crying about the pain.

"My hand! My HAND," she shouted. "It keeps signing, from my hand!"

Wild theories after that one got out. A lot of at home accidents from fanatic groups, as electricity use in occults started to resurge.

And I sometimes wondered about the mysticism of it myself. EVPs. Photographs. Energy. It's difficult not to have some sort of obsession with volts and amps, or Tesla coils while in this field. For instance, when electric cars were commercialized, I embraced them. Watches. Books on my tablet. It seems like such an odd thing to say for someone in such an archaic profession, but it is true.

That was until it happened to me.

What became the most important case of my career, turned into one of pure terror. But I suppose I can't properly tell that story. Not really. Not without telling the last moments of Jennifer Tooley. As the this story and hers intertwine. Although, I don't know where the truth begins and the lies end.

What I do know is that Jennifer Tooley was a budding journalist on this side of the Sierra Nevada. An all valley kind of girl. Beautiful, young, and full of potential. And on the night she was murdered. She was covering an event for work.

Her text messages didn't indicate anything out of the ordinary. Gossip. Complaining about her dress. Her boss. How much she enjoyed the food. And what she hated. Later in the night, she even sent her brother a photo of the "cute guy" she had just met at the bar. A photo that would turn out to be the only clear image of her killer prior to his apprehension. And I mean this when I say. It's as if before that photo was taken of him. The man never even existed. He's in none of the public records. And as of this writing, no one has come forth to identify him or claim him as kin.

&#x200B;

Jennifer Tooley's body would be found 4 days later in a nearby cabin, after her brother reported her missing. She was found along with all of her belongings. Among them was a napkin where she had written: **Tonight I met a man. Though he claimed to be something more. But isn't that what they all say?**

There was also a video that was uncovered from her phone. Which was erroneously leaked to the public. Causing quite the stir.

In the video it showed Jennifer Tooley swimming for her life. She's screaming a sound my heart will never forget. Splashing. As she struggles to breathe after every stroke - far away from shore. And it's worth noting that Tooley was an excellent swimmer at the collegiate level. And had won multiple competitions. But that night, none of it seemed to matter. As shots pan to the shore where the man can be seen standing next to the cabin, back to her out deep in the water, back to the man who begins walking. On top of the water. Towards her. She turns again, screaming. Swimming. And looks back several times before the audio starts to hear the footsteps on the water getting closer. And closer. Until he's standing next to her. Crouches. And says, "Do not be afraid."

&#x200B;

The video cuts out. And it's radio silence from the department. I feel as if that made it worse. The rumors that followed.

&#x200B;

It started with a few frat boys, said they recognized the wanted man at one of their parties. They couldn't provide any proof, and after some digging it seemed they were trying to ruin the name of a rival football team. But even after the truth was revealed. It didn't matter. The damage had been done.

Next thing I know, there's sightings of the man. At this ice cream parlor here. Or a restaurant there. Locals even began reporting someone screaming Jennifer Tooley's name past sunset. Headless goats. UFOS. The Swamp Ape. And even red candles found in the shape of a fallen star deep inside the woods were subsequently linked back to the killer.

So that by the time the man was finally captured, and came up for trial. Everything was up in the air. No one could get a good grasp of the situation. For every 5 people who called the man for what he was, a stone cold killer. There was a hardcore zeitgeists who would claim that this man, the murderer, was the new prophet. Some even claiming that the man was Jesus.

The evidence at the trial quelled most of that noise, as evidence that hadn't been leaked was finally released to the public. What he did to that poor girl. Holding her under the water. Dragging her back to shore. The way he chopped her up, hanging her on a hook in that old cabin, the look of life still in her eyes as he made her smile for the camera, was unholy.

The state didn't know what to do with him. They were afraid. And when someone suggested he be sent to the electric chair. I knew that my time was coming.

And in October, that call came. I had been eating well, getting a lot of sleep. Really trying my best to stay in a good head space before the execution.

Although the day of, didn't go as planned.

Usually the officials and those invited, family of the victim and the convicted are brought into the room first. Then the officials, the Priest, and the executioner. So there's limited face to face between us and the condemned in order to lessen any psychological impacts. But this wasn't the case. Somehow the duties got mixed up and the Priest was running late. And I was left in the holding hall with the murderer. Alone.

"Do you know what my last meal was," he asked. "Bread. And water." He chuckled, "Of course when I drank it, was it still water?"

I tried to ignore him.

"Say, it was kind of like the day they caught me. I was drinking wine-"

"Shut up," I rapped the wheelchair they had strapped him to.

"-but they said it wasn't wine."

The report said it was blood.

He laughed as if he could hear inside of my head.

"Go on. Ask it." He leaned in real close. I could see his teeth. "Why did I leave all of that evidence behind?" He laughed again as he answered his own question. "So that they would know it was me."

By the time everything was sorted out. All the people and paper work. It was already an hour past noon. We were running late, and I was afraid the entire thing would be postponed. As if it were an act of God somehow.

But I knew that if I were called to service again, that I couldn't do it. I wouldn't be able to stand the man a second time. So when we were all mostly gathered, I pushed forward before anyone could get in a word.

In less than 15 minutes, we had him strapped up and the machine was primed. The phone was still on the hook and all last rites were said. The prisoner had opted out of any last words. And I was given the nod to send justice straight through his brain down to his sole.

I pulled the lever.

His body contorted and snapped, shivering. His mouth opened, I could see inside it, a gasping hole that was blacker then night, as blue and white lightning came in flashes. And for once, I didn't let my hand off the lever, not until this monster's hair stood on end.

When it was done a few people clapped. But it was Eddie I noticed first. He was looking at me, his eyes wide and telling, for he knew better than most what I had done, and exactly how I was feeling. How a killer only seemed to spread his madness from one person to the next, even in the end.

Before anyone could move.

The man opened his eyes and smiled.

No one knew what to do.

"What the fuck happened," the Chief yelled at me. "Was it primed?"

I could barley nod.

Eddie agreed, "I checked it myself."

"What should we do," someone asked.

One of the men in the plastic seats got up angrily. From the papers I knew him to be Jennifer Tooley's brother. He was full of anger. Rushing forward. As two officers detained him to the floor.

The man in the electric chair only laughed.

The red phone suddenly rang, and everyone grew quiet. Except for the man. The Chief answered the phone on the third ring. I could see him shaking his head, and then after a brief exchange he turned to me and said, "Do it again."

I pulled down the lever and this time I stepped back and watched.

It went on for a whole 5 minutes before I turned it off. Everyone was silent this time. We all watched the burnt body carefully. The Chief somehow goaded Eddie in approaching the chair.

He crept closer. I could see him smelling the air. See the shiver run down his spine as he approaches the man in the chair.

In an instant. Blood spurted everywhere. Eddie fell backwards howling, clutching his face, as the man, the murderer, was grinning from ear to ear with a piece of Eddie's skin in his mouth.

I could hear a few people screaming. Some were hurriedly trying to leave. I stood there in shock as I didn't know what to do. And after nearly an hour of commotion, the coroner was forcibly coerced into writing down a time of death as no pulse could be found, although the body kept twitching.

Eventually, the guards removed the man without a name and strapped him back into the wheelchair. And as long as I live. I'll swear. That even as the door was swinging shut behind him, I could still hear that man laughing.
