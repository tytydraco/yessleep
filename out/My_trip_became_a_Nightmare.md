I’d never driven to Miami before. I was supposed to go years ago, but things shut down and travel felt impossible. When life finally returned to something normal, I planned the drive myself. Half the places my friend Jeremy and I talked about seeing were gone for good, but I figured I’d still make the trip.

I was somewhere in the middle of nowhere when it happened. The radio cut from Dr. Dre to pure static. The screen didn’t glitch—it *melted*, the station numbers warping into strings of random letters like the signal was trying to speak. Before I could touch the dial, it slid to volume control on its own. I turned it down and pretended I didn’t just watch my car try to communicate with me.

Three minutes later the sky darkened. Heavy clouds rolled in so fast it felt like someone switched them on. Then came the rain—thick sheets pounding the windshield even though it was the middle of summer and the app had promised clear skies. The GPS said I had 53 km left. Yeah—kilometers. I stick to metric; it makes more sense. But the distance wasn’t what froze me. It was the faint yellow fuel light flickering like something breathing. I should’ve noticed it earlier. Jeremy told me to top up before leaving, and I shrugged it off.

I prayed there was a service stop nearby. Somehow, the highway spat one out just ahead, like it had been waiting for me.

The rain stopped instantly. Not slowly—just gone. I wiped the windshield once, and through the streaked glass I saw a road sign, or what was left of one. The metal hung crooked, dangling from a single bolt. The wind should’ve torn it down already, yet it clung there like it had a purpose.

The service area looked abandoned from afar, but the lights were on. I pulled in, stepped out, and walked toward the bathrooms before fueling up. Inside, a handful of people sat at the fast-food counters: Subway, KFC, a small Chinese place, and a dim little café. No one talked. No one looked up. They ate like they were trying to remember how food worked.

Between the restaurants sat a narrow storefront, barely wide enough for a door. The only reason I noticed it was the fading sign above it: Souvenir.

I don’t know why I went in. Habit, maybe. Inside, an elderly woman sat at the register. Silver hair pulled into a tight bun, thin glasses, a crossword book open in front of her. She didn’t move when I stepped inside. Didn’t nod. Didn’t blink. She just stared like she’d been expecting me.

The shop was nothing special—dusty postcards, cheap bracelets, hats, old shirts. The kind of stuff you only buy when you’ve run out of reasons to keep moving.

Then I saw it. A cap with the old Miami bull logo. Not the current one—the old one that got pulled years back after a plagiarism dispute. Jeremy always joked about buying one if he ever found it. We used to wear the original logo in high school; our principal was obsessed with that team. Seeing it here felt impossible



I don’t know why that souvenir shop bothered me so much.  
 It was just off the highway, cracked neon buzzing like it was dying. The shelves were packed with old-looking junk — not antiques, but things that felt… wrong. Like props from a place that remembered the past differently than we do.

I found a shirt with a bull mascot — Team Bulls, the logo nearly identical to my old high school’s. Same colors, same snarl. Only a tiny detail in the eye was different, like someone copied it from memory after years underground. I bought it as a joke for my friend Jeremy. A Pepsi too. The clerk didn’t say a single word. Didn’t even look at me. Just scanned my stuff and slid the bag across the counter like he was afraid to touch me.

The drive to Miami should have been easy. But twenty minutes later, as I rolled into the city, everything felt off — like the joyful beach scene outside my window was staged. Too bright. Too clean. Like it was trying too hard.

Then the man appeared in front of my car.

I slammed the brakes, tires screaming. A kid stepped out from behind him — pale, dripping ice cream down his wrist. The man just stared at me, eyes wide like I’d committed a sin. Like I wasn’t supposed to arrive.

My heart nearly stopped. I parked a block away and sat there shaking, trying to breathe. I kept telling myself I was tired. That I was just imagining the look he gave me.

By the time I made it to Jeremy’s place, the sun was dipping. He was waiting outside with his dog — Rudolf. Friendly, brown-eyed mutt, wagging so hard his whole body wiggled. I put the cap from the souvenir shop on him and we laughed. For a moment it felt normal.

Then evening settled in, and something in the house felt… watching.

Jeremy talked — hospital stories, burnout, pandemic exhaustion. I tried to listen, but my eyelids felt heavy, like the room itself was pulling me down. The dog trotted into the garden. The sitcom played. Jeremy kept talking, not looking at me.

And then I heard it.

A sharp crack, like wood splitting under heat. I jerked upright.  
 Jeremy didn’t react. Just kept talking, voice steady, eyes on the TV.

I looked outside.

Rudolf was running across the yard, but he wasn’t a dog anymore. He was a shape — burning, flickering, moving wrong, like fire had decided to imitate a living thing. I yelled Jeremy’s name, shouted about his dog, but when he looked, Rudolf was right there beside him, yawning. Perfectly fine. Like nothing happened.

I told myself it was shock from the near-accident earlier. Fatigue. Stress. I tried to breathe. Tried to act normal. Jeremy got water for me. Ordered pizza. We ate while the sun went down, and the house seemed to settle deeper into the earth.

Then the TV flickered. A game show.  
 The contestant looked like Jeremy — nearly identical, except for the hair.

The question was about the Greek goddess Hestia.

“Fire!” Jeremy yelled at the TV, half-joking. And then he froze. His eyes went wide.

“There is fire,” he whispered. “In the garden.”

I turned. And I saw it again. The burning shape — running, panicked, with the unmistakable outline of a dog in flame.

We raced outside with water, smothered the fire, choking on smoke and panic. When the flames died, the shape collapsed, and what was left wasn’t a burned animal — it was nothing. Just scorched ground, steaming, like something had burned its way *out* of the world.

When we turned around, Rudolf was behind us.  
 Tail wagging. Tongue lolling. Perfectly unharmed.

But his eyes were wrong.  
 They reflected the fire.  
 Even in the dark.

The silence between us felt like a living thing.  
 When I looked at Jeremy, I recognized every emotion clawing across his face — fear, regret, a crushing sort of dread that I’d never seen on another human being before. It wasn’t just that something bad had happened. It was that something wrong had settled over us, and we both knew it.

There were no tears. He didn’t shake or scream. He just stared past me, as if the world outside the window had shifted into something he didn’t recognize anymore. Then a knock rattled the front door. A woman’s voice drifted through — a neighbor asking if everything was alright.

“Yeah,” Jeremy said. “Everything’s fine.”

It wasn’t. I knew it. He knew it.

When the door clicked shut again, silence swallowed the room. For a moment, neither of us moved. Time didn’t feel real. Finally, Jeremy spoke without looking at me.

“We’ll talk about it later,” he muttered.

I tried to respond, but he was already walking upstairs. The door closed. A second later I heard beer caps tapping against wood.

I didn’t sleep. Every time my eyes shut, I saw it again — that thing, those impossible moments, the nightmare that didn’t feel like a dream at all.

When morning finally came, my brain felt hollow and heavy at the same time. It took a minute before I could even remember what I'd dreamed, and when it hit me, the fear returned like a punch.

I had been running up a hill, chasing Jeremy through thick fog. It felt like an old horror game — grainy atmosphere, no sound except my breathing and the crunch of dirt. Jeremy never turned around. The closer I got, the thicker the fog became, until I couldn’t see my own hands. Then the ground disappeared beneath my feet — I was about to pitch off a cliff. I stopped just in time, and the fog dissolved. Jeremy’s footprints ended right at the edge. One incomplete print hung there like he’d stepped into nothing.

A soft knock snapped me awake for real.  
 “You up?” Jeremy asked through the door.

I told him yes — or at least I think I did — and dragged myself out of bed. He had already made pancakes. Outside the window, a small mound of dirt rested in the grass. On top of it sat a photograph. Rudolf’s picture.

He didn’t say anything about it. Didn’t look at it. Just slid a plate toward me and chewed in silence. I understood. We weren’t supposed to talk about last night. Whatever happened — whatever we saw — it wasn’t meant to be spoken out loud.

After breakfast, Jeremy insisted we take my car.

“Trust me,” he said quietly. “You’ll want to leave when you want to.”

He smiled like it was a joke, but I could tell it wasn’t.

He claimed he knew a place — “coral beaches in the woods,” he called it. That phrase has been stuck in my head ever since. I don’t think it’s a real thing people say, but he acted like I should’ve known. He didn’t wear hiking clothes. No boots. No gear. Just jeans and that faded baseball shirt I gave him yesterday.

We drove in silence until the city melted into fields and narrow trails. It was beautiful — unsettlingly beautiful. Flowers everywhere, like someone had painted them on. Perfect rows. Vibrant colors. The kind of scenery that doesn’t look real unless you’re dreaming or standing in front of a photoshopped brochure.

We climbed a gentle slope toward a lookout. People walked around us, quiet and smiling, like nothing bad could ever happen in that place. For a second, I believed it. I breathed in the cold air and let the peace sink into me. My shoulders loosened. My thoughts went still.

Then I blinked.

And the world wasn’t the same.

The hill was gone.  
 The gardens were gone.  
 The sky, the people — everything disappeared.

I stood in flat grassland swallowed by white mist. My body refused to move. My eyes locked forward, trapped. Panic crawled inside my ribs but didn’t have anywhere to go. I breathed — I know I breathed — but I couldn’t lift a finger.

I don’t think I was in control anymore.

When I tried to move, it felt like I was waking up inside my own body for the first time, like I’d been tied down by chains I couldn’t see. The harder I fought, the more I felt myself breaking through whatever held me still.

That’s when I noticed it.

Something was coming toward me. It wasn’t walking. It glided. Not floating like someone tip‑toeing in the dark — not creeping or sneaking. It moved as if the floor wasn’t real, as if it didn’t need the world the rest of us are stuck in.

For a second, I forgot how to breathe. Every part of me screamed that if I didn’t move right then, if I didn’t tear myself out of whatever held me, something final would happen. Something I wouldn’t come back from.

It kept coming.

Closer. Too close. Just a few feet away—

“No. No. No—stay away from me!”

I don’t know how, but suddenly it was far ahead of me and I could move again. I ran. I ran like my life depended on it — and maybe it did — but that thing glided faster. It wasn’t human. I could feel it. It felt like pure wrongness.

Then it grabbed me.

Everything went white. A voice screamed — not mine — “Stop him!”

I opened my eyes and I was hanging off the edge of a lookout platform in the city, my hands locked in the grip of strangers trying to pull me back up. My body felt impossibly heavy, like gravity had singled me out. Dozens of people strained to pull me up…and still I barely moved.

I looked down.

Jeremy was clinging to my legs, shaking, desperate. And behind him — clinging to him — was it. A dead weight dragging him downward. It crawled up his back like it had all the time in the world.

No one else saw. I swear they didn’t.

A security guard grabbed my arm and tried to lift me. I rose, inch by inch — and so did the thing. It climbed until its face hovered inches from mine. It smiled. Its fingers dug into my clothing like it was deciding who to take.

I tried to scream Jeremy’s name. I tried to warn him. But the demon wrapped its hand around his wrist, like claiming property. Jeremy didn’t even react.

One moment he was there.

The next, his grip went slack…and he was gone.

No scream. Just the sound of a body hitting something far below. A dull, final impact. Everyone around me went silent, frozen, like they couldn’t understand what they’d just witnessed.

The demon vanished.

I stared down at Jeremy’s body as they pulled me back onto solid ground. Later, witnesses said they only saw me slip — dangling over the edge, terrified — and Jeremy trying to help. They didn’t see the thing. They didn’t feel it.

They want answers. So do I.

I drove away afterward. I couldn’t bring myself to go to Jeremy’s place. I didn’t turn on music. I didn’t think. I just drove, in silence, trying not to feel the shape of its hand still on me.

When I reached the highway, the radio flickered back on by itself. I shut it off. I couldn’t listen.

I stopped at a service area — the same one I’d visited the night before. Only this time, the souvenir shop wasn’t there. The building just…wasn’t. Every other place was in the exact same spot. But the shop? Gone like it never existed.

I drove around looking for it. Nothing. No trace, no sign it had ever been real.

I haven’t found it since.
