Entering the room past two stone faced Marines guarding the double door, I was mildly surprised how well a 3 star hotel in mountainous nowhere managed to put together a secure meeting for some of the most powerful figures in government. Military apparatus strewn about in the nearby rooms and halls. At the center, a long table in black cloth sits official looking members of federal agencies and their constituents. The gruff FBI agent I met this morning stands at the podium with a projector shining the blank canvas behind him. I take my seat.

The agent begins, "Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Today's date and time - November 19th, 1994, 1pm Eastern time. Location - Sundial Hotel, Montpelier, Vermont. Preliminary meeting in connection to a matter of possible national security. Time's pressing as we're all aware so let's get right to it."

He takes a beat for the room to settle down.

"Introductions as follows: I am Special Agent Sam Neuhouse, FBI; Brigadier General Nathan J. Carr, USMC; Director of National Intelligence Alan Kilgore; Senator Heather Reed, and lastly," he gestures at me, "Dr. Jonathan Ramos, physicist from Dartmouth University who arrived with his staff the morning after the event."

I shift in my chair, clear discomfort on my face being the center of attention in a locked, secure room full of very important people. Military personnel scattered about. No cameras, no media, no journalists.

"This is a classified conference in reference to the anomaly formally designated as the 'Cube.'" Neuhouse brings a photo slide of the object on screen, "first discovered on March 7th, twelve days ago, in a heavily wooded area approximately three miles northeast of Montpelier, Vermont. A local boy, Connor Jacobs, 14, first to stumble on the Cube while out bug hunting and reported to authorities shortly after by his father, Henry Jacobs. Whom noted, perhaps in correlation to the Cube, that his daughter, Emma, Connor's sister, went missing at the same time as its discovery. She was 10 years old. The children were allegedly together at the time of the incident."

A new slide show a recent photo of the three family members together on a picnic ground.

Senator Reed stiffens, eyes narrowing. Next to her, Carr's granite expression faulters slightly. Kilgore I assume has already been briefed as he show no reaction.

"Where are the father and son now?" Reed asks, "and have they been questioned?"

"The Jacobs' home, just 8 minutes from this hotel." US chief of intelligence Alan Kilgore said, cutting off Neuhouse before he can reply, "the detective on the case was not able to get far with questioning. He observed the boy either deflected or downplayed Emma's disappearance while the father often dipped into long stretches of unblinking silence. Repeated attempts at conversation proved difficult in his current state."

"Both could be in shock," Carr mulled, "something like that just doesn't happen on a random Tuesday."

"I plan on sitting down with them later this evening." Kilgore noted.

Neuhouse nods, clearing his throat, "an initial report from the local PD states the object is a translucent, shimmering symmetrical cube, measuring exactly four meters at each edge. Upon closer inspection, all cube faces exhibit an uncountable amount of various geometric shapes moving in all directions - forming out of and collapsing back into each other within the confines of the Cube. It is transparent, becoming increasingly opaque with a blue hue at the center. The ground surrounding the object is undisturbed; save for missing patch now occupied by the anomaly, described as 'simply vanished, as if taken out with a giant square shaped cookie cutter' with the vacant slot left perfectly snug for the object."

A pause, his eyes scanning, scrutinizing. Unease creeping into his tone, he push on.

"Near the north face, disintegrated remains of a presumably human skeleton is found a yard away. No direct contact made with either the Cube or skeleton, no further actions taken upon setting a perimeter. Dr. Ramos and his staff was on site the next day, clearance obtained."

"The skeleton, the missing girl?" Asked Reed.

"Not likely, Senator," he answered, "bone structure is closer to that of an adult than a prepubescent kid - plus it's been decaying for some time so says to the report. DNA lab tests pending. Search parties have been in progress for Emma Jacobs since the 9th but no update so far."

Neuhouse nod towards me before vacating the podium. All heads swivel in my direction - minus Heather Reed, still studying the pile of bones.

Taking several deep breaths as I make my way to the front, preparing to speak into existence the insanity of my experience from the last several days. I step up the raised platform, projector remote in hand.

"Right. My team and I began right away, we've assembled our major findings into concise bulletin points and can elaborate if need be. The police report's eyeball observation is accurate but that's just the tip of the iceberg." I begin, clicking to the corresponding slides. "Visual analysis - The Cube does not reflect or absorb light at any angle, distance, or intensity. While it does cast a shadow in the sun indicating the existence of *something*, it does not interact with light photons in the way we expect. This also means no temperature change. Our thermal cameras detected no variance in heat energy either absorbed or transmitted. While seemingly transparent, any light source directed at it simply stops at the surface. No refraction. However, the Cube maintains a consistent ambient blue glow. There is an internal source illuminating the Cube throughout we've been unable to pinpoint at this time."

The Senator's circle buzz with whispers, undoubtedly Reed is getting a layman's summary of what, to her untrained ears, must be word salad nonsense.

I resume, "audio analysis - None. The object does not interact with its surrounding air molecules. Lastly, physical contact - basically we poke and throw things at it and see what happens. We stuck a portion of a branch breaching past the one of its surfaces with no resistance, that same portion was missing when an assistant brought it back. Upon examination, no sign of breaking, tearing, or burning occured to the wood fibers. We poured a liter of water onto the top of the Cube, it vanished into the center, no splashing observed. Our first breakthrough was tossing a moss covered rock that came out the other side, intact and but unexpectedly much cleaner than before, dirt and moss all but gone."

"Dr. Ramos, it has come to our attention something happened to one of your assistants during this 'direct contact' phase, correct?" Brigadier General Carr asks in his hoarse yet imposing voice, a product of decades in the service.

I sigh internally, dreading this particular moment. "That's right."

"Please explain."
 
"The working theory at that point is that the Cube interact with organics, like moss and wood, in some capacity. I phoned my department at the University requesting a delivery run of any available lab rats but it was going to take time. Of course we could've went for any small wildlife scuttering about the area but for ethical reasons did not pursue." I close my eyes, memories of the moment rushing back to the forefront. A slice of insanity I can never hope to forget. "My primary assistant, Evie Gunderson, a post graduate with a brilliant mind and a near maniacal drive for knowledge - she, well, began growing restless."

I pull up a slide of Evie - a freeze frame from a recording of her on the ground next to the Cube, her face twisted in abject terror, mouth open stuck in a scream, her left hand grabbing at the wrist of a still attached but severely decomposed right hand. Now nothing but dried, blackened dead tissue stretched toght against bone, belonging more to a long buried corpse than a healthy 28 year old graduate.

The room's ambience raise an octave as loud murmurs erupt from the crowd. Reactions follow varied degrees of disbelief; Neuhouse's hand shot up to cover his gaping mouth, Kilgore forced his eyes down after a minute of unblinking stare, Carr's eyes twitched but otherwise kept his stoic composure. Behind them, their cadre of helpers scratching pen onto paper documenting every second.

"What happened?" Asked a shaking Reed, a tremor in her voice.

I exhale a long breath, "Evie, at our turned backs, slid her hand into the object stopping just before her wrist - she pulled back right away but it was done. Her hand, in short, experienced acute necrosis, equivalent to what you'd find after a decade buried six feet in the ground. And before you ask - no, it has not been amputated."

"Oh? And why is that?" Kilgore followed up with an incredulous expression.

"Simply, she refused it. Multiple times."

"What do you mean 'refused'?"

"Exactly what I said. Not only that, she has made several attempts to return to the Cube. We denied it, of course, but she didn't let up. Eventually it escalated to physical restraints. Every time saying she, and I quote, 'have to finish I started.'"

Casting a glance to Agent Neuhouse, "the skeletal remains you found next to the Cube, I have an inkling who it belongs to," I said.

The agent fixed his eyes on me, understanding dawns. "Emma." He uttered, almost to himself.

"What are you saying, Doctor Ramos?" Voiced a perplexed Heather Reed, disbelief in her tone.

I bring up a recording of a conversation between Evie and I after she's had time to collect herself. "It's better if I just show you." I said.
