It was a day like any other in the clinic, just another routine eye exam in what had become a monotonous cycle of patients. I hardly paid attention to the names anymore—just the ages and the concerns scrawled in barely legible handwriting on their forms.

 That day, an 82-year-old woman was brought in by her family. Her frail hands shook slightly as her daughter helped her into the chair, their faces tight with concern. I could tell, without a word spoken, that they had been worried about her for some time.

Her eyes were clouded with age, and she moved slowly, with the cautious steps of someone who had long since grown accustomed to fragility. 

I smiled, trying to be as gentle as possible as I guided her through the pretest. Small talk filled the silence as I did my best to put her at ease, though something about her haunted expression made the task more difficult than usual.

When it came time for the retinal imaging, I positioned her head carefully against the machine, aligning it with the precision I’d mastered over the years. The whirr of the device was a familiar comfort—predictable, reliable.

 If you’ve never seen a retinal image, it’s like peering into a miniature universe. The inside of the eye often resembles a blazing sun, an orangeish-yellow orb with a brighter spot where the optic nerve connects. Sometimes, dark spots appear—nothing more than old scars, remnants of sun damage, or other age-related blemishes. But what I saw when I pulled up the image of her eye made my breath catch in my throat.

The screen displayed something far from the usual comforting warmth of a healthy retina. Instead of the typical vibrant tones, her retina was almost entirely a sickly blackish-grey. It wasn’t just a lack of color; it was an absence of life itself, an endless void that seemed to consume the light around it. 

I stared at the image, my heart pounding as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing. The darkness on the screen began to move, to swirl like a storm brewing in the depths of space, drawing everything into its center.

I’m not a professional—not really. My job is to conduct the pretests and pass the results on to the doctors, who have the expertise to diagnose and treat. But even with my limited knowledge, I knew this was something beyond ordinary. As I watched the swirling void, I felt a strange sensation creeping over me—a feeling like the darkness was reaching through the screen, extending its tendrils into my mind. I blinked hard, trying to shake the growing sense of dread, but the feeling only intensified. 

It was as though the void was staring back at me, pulling at the edges of my consciousness, trying to drag me into its endless depths.I wanted to help her, to do something—anything—but I knew there was nothing our facility could offer. 

We were just a telehealth clinic, a middleman between the patient and real medical care. This woman needed something far more than I could provide. With a shaky hand, I printed out the referral, forcing myself to look away from the screen, from that horrifying void that threatened to consume me. I handed the paper to her family, my voice barely steady as I explained that she needed to go to an ophthalmology center immediately.

They thanked me and left, but the image didn’t leave with them. It lingered in my mind like a shadow that refused to fade. I tried to move on, to push the unsettling experience to the back of my mind, but it followed me home. 

That night, when I closed my eyes, I saw it again. The swirling void, closer now, as if it had slipped into my mind and found a permanent place.

Every time I close my eyes, it’s there, pulling me in, inching closer and closer. 

The darkness is no longer confined to the screen—it’s a part of me now.

And there’s a dark spot in my vision that wasn’t there before, a constant reminder that something is coming for me.
