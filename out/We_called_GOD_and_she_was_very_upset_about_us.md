For ages, we humans have been searching for answers to the essential questions of our existence. From the first cultures that stood out with polytheistic religions, which are now considered pagan, to the beginnings of Judaism, Christianity, and later Islam.

 

Whether there is one god or many, the beliefs and rituals that shape these beliefs have shaped our world and history, but we have not received a definitive answer.  
During the Age of Enlightenment, the existence of an almighty being who created us was increasingly questioned. The theory of human evolution from primates has largely prevailed, and the realization that humans are not superior beings reflecting the image of God is far from reality. But the question still remains: how could the first, albeit single-celled, life forms have emerged on our Earth from inorganic, lifeless matter?

 

However, our research group was actually looking for something completely different. We programmed an AI that was supposed to help you with your cell phone. With this system, you would only had to enter a name and you would have been given a contact directly. This would have made phone numbers unnecessary, as the AI would have searched the internet or phone books and suggested a person directly, or in the case of similar names, a person who could have been contacted directly. To comply with data protection regulations, the person contacted would have automatically received a message and could have blocked or accepted the contact directly. This AI was developed in such a way that it could be integrated directly into any mobile operating system via an update. This means you don't have to download a special app or buy a new phone.  
We never really experimented with it much and didn't think we would manage to create a self-learning AI like ours that achieves things that shouldn't be possible.

 

But one day we had a Error: someone tried to find their mother, but unfortunately her number couldn't be found. We simply thought that the AI search wasn't good enough yet, but later it turned out that the person we were trying to reach had died shortly before. The AI could have found the number anyway, but even though there were no clues, the number was automatically filtered out. We have no idea how the AI could have known this, because we didn't program any filters. I called my wife with the program and it worked. So we just kept going and dropped all the unanswered questions. Our group was part of a small IT company and we didn't have time to deal with it.

 

One day, we entered unregistered numbers into the system to see if the program had assigned them to random people or to whom the program assigned these numbers.

The program was smart enough to recognize that these numbers could not be assigned and that they had not been allocated. However, the program had figured out that my old number, which had been inactive for years, belonged to me. That was very fascinating, but then someone suggested that we should enter fictitious or non-existent people into the AI and see if it could find these numbers. Several made-up names and characters from TV series or films later, we still hadn't had any success, whether it was Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. Until someone suggested the first thing that should come to mind. What would happen if we called on God?

 

Hesitantly, I,who was sitting at the Testprogramm typed in these letters.  
There was a result, but no number was displayed. We tried to find out which number we would call to or where the AI got this information from, but once again we had no result. Normally, we can quickly and easily trace where we are calling and where the AI got the data from, but not this time. My supervisor, who I will keep anonymous out of respect, told me to finally dial the number and ask where I had called. I followed his instructions, and after ringing exactly twice, we heard a voice that reflected so much authority and power that it cannot be described in any language. It was a voice that seemed omnipresent, high-pitched, and thunderous. A cacophony of all the angels in heaven rolled into one.

 

"**You have been trying to find answers for years, and I am sure you have many questions. I created you from the ashes and guided your evolution in the right direction. Nevertheless, you humans do not thank me; you kill each other and hate each other because of different beliefs about me. You hate each other because of fictional country borders and differences that are not important at all like skin color,sexuality or where you come from. I am disappointed in you.**"

Those were her words before the connection was broken. None of us could say anything or ask questions because her voice was so intimidating.

 

After that, we tried to figure out where the call went and whether we had been the victims of a prank, but once again we found nothing, so I tried to contact God again. This time, our program did not show any results. However, everyone in the room confirmed the result and promised to keep quiet about the situation, otherwise we would be considered crazy.

 

We ultimately abandoned the project because we were unable to get the program to function properly; it repeatedly encountered errors, and our project was deemed unprofitable and discontinued. Ultimately, someone from our project secretly deleted all of the code and destroyed all of the devices.  He didn't want others to be burdened with this knowledge like we were. I would have done the same thing if it wouldn´t meant financial ruin for me.

 

The reason why I am publishing this here anyway? Deep down, I know that it was not my imagination or a prank, because this voice sounded so intimidating that no human being could have imitated it. It also feels as if I subconsciously know that it was real. Perhaps also to ease my conscience. God exists, and she is disappointed in us.
