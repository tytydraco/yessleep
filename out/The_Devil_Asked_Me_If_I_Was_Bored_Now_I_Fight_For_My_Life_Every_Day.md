Imagine a world in which the sky is purple, the stars, the clouds are missing, and so does the moon. Imagine a world in which the inhabitants don't rely on jobs or anything similar in the slightest to survive. Imagine a world in which the humans are nowhere near the top of the food chain. Imagine a world in which the darkness... is the only thing keeping you safe. That was my introduction to the DarkLands

A week ago I was in the library, I needed a book for my electronics and automation class. I didn't like the university I got into, I didn't like my classmates, my life felt "lifeless". "Are you bored?" the cashier asked. Without thinking much about it I answered a simple "Yea" and turned to leave. The cashier then asked me again but with a somber tone "Are you really bored?" There was no one else in the store, so I looked behind at the old lady on the other side of the counter. She had a small grin she was trying to cover. 

"Yes, why? Do you have an offer for me?" I replied.

"I sure do"

The second she finished her sentence I blinked and I realized I was in the middle of a dark alley with no light. The sky had a purple tint, there was no moon, no clouds, no sun, no stars, nothing. The street lights were all on the ground, ripped in half, destroyed by God knows what. The sidewalk wasn't much different, scratch marks that weren't from any animal I knew of were plastered all across and from where the road was supposed to be, there grew trees as tall as what I thought was more than 200 feet, they seemed to have fruits that I couldn't make out since their branches were far too high for me to see with no binoculars, let alone without light.

My shocked state was interrupted by an animal growl which I can only describe by a sound a lion merged with an elephant could reproduce. It came from the woods behind me. I took off running having a feeling that whatever made that sound wouldn't have pity on my soul. I don't know how much I ran but at one point I stopped, not only to take deep breaths but to listen for any sound, because my gut was telling me I wasn't being followed by a single creature. The weird thing was, I don't remember there being any sound except for the one coming from my nostrils. I started breathing slower and slower until there was only silence. The wind wasn't blowing, the insects, if any, didn't make any sound, the animals were nowhere to be seen or heard and the sky was turning darker by the second. It was the first moment in my life when I felt truly alone.

Suddenly, a humanoid figure appeared from behind, he had all the features of a person except he was probably above 14 feet and had muscles on every inch of the body. He looked like he could fight off an elephant. He stared menacingly into my eyes.

"How old are you?" he asked in the first human voice I've heard in forever.

"20. What are you?" I replied knowing fully well this could be my end.

"Why do you not tremble? Why are you not afraid. Human."

If I were to give him an answer it would've been that I didn't knew either, but the truth was I've been trained to do that, even though "trained" isn't the best word for it, in most situations I can stay calm in order to think and my brain was saying that this is not a situation to panic in, I had to think. Whatever this monster was I had to find a way out.

"Our territory," a voice screamed as a young woman was making her way to us with a weapon in her hand.

The giant shot her an angry look as he left. He put his hands down and started running on all 4 with the speed of a car.

"Year? What year are you from?" The woman said hastily.

"2022. What? Why?" I replied more surprised than anything.

"Planet?"

"Earth."

"Come with me." I stood for a second and looked at her, "NOW!" she screamed with her eyes opened as wide as humanly possible.

She started running with me right behind her. Our speed was similar but her stamina outshined mine by a lot. Whispers started coming from behind us as we made our way to what looked like a desert with massive cuboid structures of different lengths. She took out a flashlight and pointed it ahead.  When we got close enough to the border between the forest we were in and the desert we were running towards, the woman I was behind took a sharp left and after a couple more seconds we ran into a door. She opened it with a key and screamed at me to go inside. I went in and looked behind to see her struggling to close the door. There was a thing, a very dark silhouette behind the door, probably the source of the whispers. "NEXT ONE" she screamed as she let go the handle. The second door was unlocked and we managed to get behind it and lock it.

"I know you have lots of questions so let me answer as many as I can. But first, let's eat." she said looking like she managed to cheat death, but not for the first time.

We descended into what looked like an underground house with a bathroom, a kitchen, two bedrooms and a living room. There was nobody else here. She opened a cabinet and pulled out two portions of canned pork and beans. "You're not allergic to these, are you?", I shook my head to communicate that I'm not and I'm more than ready to eat. She microwaved them and then we sat down. It was probably the best meal I've had in my entire life. After I finished it, the events of the day started coming back to me.

"What was all that? Who are you?" I asked trying to stay calm.

"My name is Megan. What about you?"

"Nolan."

"So, Nolan. Before I tell you what I know i need you to tell me more about yourself. I want you to tell me some of the biggest events that happened in the past couple years. In your world."

"Can you just go straight to the point and tell me what the hell is happening around here?"

"Not until you respond to my 3 questions."

"Fine. Last major event in history was covid, a pandemic spread a across the globe. Next big one was a war that erupted recently."

"Second question, what day is it?"

"I don't know? Like 27th of December."

"That's fantastic news, " she said with genuine enthusiasm. "And third question, tell me what happened before you arrived here and everything after that."

"I was the library, buying a book for one of my uni classes when the cashier, an old lady, asked me if I was bored, to which I responded to yes. After that she said something and I ended up here. I checked my surroundings and heard an animal like a-a-a lion and and an elephant merged. I ran a while and after a short break, a man appeared in front of me, he asked about my age and "Why are you not scared?". After that you came, you know the rest. Now please tell me this is all a dream so I can wake up."

"Unfortunately it isn't. We've all been transported here by the devil."

"You're kidding, right?" If there's one thing I can't do without, it's a logical explanation.

"We just call it that, no one knows what he actually is. Anyways, we are in the DarkLands, we named it like this. It's a place where the creatures from the top of the food chain in their respective umiverse get transported along with a part of their habitat. I asked you about major events for two reasons, first being to see if we really are from the same universe and second to see if the land we are on right now gets teleported along with any of us, but apparently it's a replica."

"That doesn't make any kind of sense." I replied, knowing fully well that the serious look on her face meant she's telling the truth.

"Tell me about it, I've only been here for 2 weeks. Anyways, every once in a while a number of people appear, well not only people, top of the food chain guys do too but in their respective region. From what we've learned, the rules for these entities are 1: they have to be dominant on their planet, 2: they need the ability to speak with one another properly and 3: they need to have a chance at survival. So you won't see any small insects or stuff like that."

"Now you're just bombing my brain with information." I felt overwhelmed, how could that be? How could my perception of reality change? I thought to myself.

"You'll get used to it, we don't even know fragments of it, we don't know much about the other species or the rules of this universe, all I've told you could be completly wrong but it's what we have to go with for now. Let me continue and then you can ask any questions. The elephant-lion sounding thing, we have no name for it, they didn't want to discuss it with us. We call them Elions And yes we can talk to any creature. They actually are the size of elephants but are far more agile and are carnivore. The tall man you saw in the forest was a Cerento, they didn't develop advanced technology but instead they evolved to fight any animal. They told us how they fought off dinosaurs. They consider us inferior and so do we. We have a pact with them that they can't come into our territory and we can't either. From time to time a rogue comes. The dark thing you probably saw behind the door is a Darklin, we just named them that way because they only move in the dark which is good because night comes rarely. If the sky is anything but black, it's day. Darklins, I can't describe them to you, we can't really see them, only feel them, they defy what we know about the world, we would probably need to take math and remake it to understand what those are. They're more of some kind of energy, don't have any form in particular. The desert you saw while running here is their home, they live in the isolated cuboids that are connected."

"Why did the Cerento ask me about my age?"

"He could've mistaken you for one of his own. They are about our size when they're 5 months old from what I undersrand."

"I honestly don't know what to say."

"You could start by washing the dishes as a thank you."

"You're a pretty nice person, are there others around here?"

"Yes but most of them are in the center of our area, there is a massive city with all kinds of things. Rockets, underground labs, skyscrapers and most of the things humanity achieved. Also they might not be as nice as me. Let me ask you this. Do you have family at home? Friends, waiting for you?"

That question seemed a bit mean, but from the look on her face she didn't say it with bad intentions. "No, not realy." I replied honestly.

"Most of the humans, hell, even the creatures transported here were lonely, "bored" as the devil puts it, on the other world, people that wouldn't be missed by society. Expect the people you meet not to be too happy or nice. You seem like a smsrt enough guy, you'll figure everyone out, that's if we don't die before we meet them. Without weapons we're being hunted and decimated like pigs. Most of the city is destroyed, some creatures planted seeds beneath our roads and from them grew massive trees, some other creatures ran through our tallest buildings, we're mostly safe underground but we don't know for how long. The most one of us has stayed here was 2 months, they said the looked perfect back then. In just a few days everything went to shit. I've been here for only 2 weeks."

I had just realised this was the longest conversation I've had in months, no, years. And I teared up a bit. "Thanks, for saving me and for telling me all thes.e"

"Hey, no need to get emotional." She said tearing up a bit herself. Then she hugged me. "We all have to stick together."

"I'll wash the dishes now." I said right before an alarm started sounding. It sounded like it came from outside. "What's that?"

"Oh God," she said visibly disturbed. "There's an alarm system in place, it's covering our entire territory. We ring it whenever something bad happens to the main station and have to move to the next one." We stood there, unable to do anything for our fellow humans, powerless.

I'm sorry this is all I can tell you about for now, I have to do something, hopefully you'll hear from me soon enough. This is a story about how we live on the edge everyday, waiting for our deaths.
