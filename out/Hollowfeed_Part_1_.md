I saw her pacing in and out of the bathroom at the end of the long, narrow hallway, her figure cutting in and out of the dim light like some broken film reel. She was muttering nonsense, something guttural—words in a language I couldn’t fully place. Maybe something about the tap water, how it tasted off. „Kranówa," she called it, her voice clipped.

The smell hit first. Cheap tobacco burned down to its last rancid inch. Vodka fumes sweating out of empty bottles. The stale, metallic stench of 15% beer crusting over at the edges of old cans.

The taste followed. Dry, acidic air, the kind that leaves your throat raw and your tongue begging for spit.

And the sight... of a cheap hellhole. 

I knew I didn’t have long. The second she heard me—game over.

I bolted for the kitchen, my breath coming in uneven bursts. My hands tore through drawers, frantically pawing for something sharp, something final. A knife? A shard of glass? Fucking blender? Anything.

Her footsteps. Behind me. Slow, deliberate. Then her arms were around me, a slack, heavy hug that dragged me back into her stink. Her touch was a chain.

I whispered, bile rising in my throat. 

„..it is what it is."

I turned, slow, careful, and caught her gaze. Her eyes stopped me for a beat longer than I intended. They were glassy but bright, feral, like a stray mutt trying to gauge if you’d kick it or feed it. Her face, though—it was as rough as her smell. Mid-20s? Late 30s? It was impossible to tell under her ruin. A life lived uphill and downhill all at once, collapsing in on itself.

There was something there—a spark. Twisted loyalty, dirty devotion. A kind of love you’d find between a dog and its neglectful owner. It almost made me hesitate.

But then the moment passed.

The rusty scissors were already in my hand. I drove them straight into her temple, hard, with enough force to bury the blades to the handle. She twitched, jerking like a marionette with tangled strings. Her mouth opened, and the air hissed out, splattering spit across my flannel. The shirt—a hideous yellow-green checkered thing that smelled of sweat and mildew—was now wet and sticky. It made me angrier.

Her knees buckled, but she didn’t fall. Her eyes were dimming, the whites bleeding red, but she stood there, swaying like some stupid, stubborn puppet. I grabbed the scissors with my left hand, bracing against the sticky resistance. I had to twist and pull, leveraging my weight to free the blades. When they finally came loose, the sudden force drove her head sideways into the edge of the counter. 

The dull *thunk* reverberated through the room. That was what did it.

She went limp, collapsing in a heap. Her breath, though—it didn’t stop. It came in faint, wet rasps, uneven and shallow, like a dying cat choking on its last breath. I crouched down, straddling her. My ear hovered near her lips, straining to catch her final words.

„…dlacz..ego…,” she whispered.

I smiled.

And then came back from where I started. 

I sat back on the sofa, my right hand still gripping the blood-slick scissors. For a moment, I stared into the middle distance, breathing heavily, the adrenaline fading to a cold, hollow calm. I raised the scissors to my right eye. 

The first strike seemed to be just a dull, wet crunch that cut the world in half. 

Black crept in, and I had to stab three more times to finish the job, each thrust harder than the last, like I was trying to punch through wood. Blood gushed, hot and thick, streaming down my face, pooling in my lap, splattering the floor.

The left eye was a bit harder. The pain was not there only this sharp and splitting sound, but I didn’t stop. By the time it was over, the world was gone—just darkness.

The familiar hum of the interface filled the void where my senses had been.

Finally, I reached up and pulled off the helmet.

The smell of *Unum—Not Today* filled my nostrils: clean, metallic, and precise. My hands rested on the wooden desk in front of me.

*Job well done.* 

This wasn’t personal. It was just that. A *contract.*

The two of them—the girl and her boyfriend—were monsters by every definition. They’d made a habit of hurting dogs, finding owners in the park, pretending to pet their animals, only to beat the creatures senseless and their owners. They didn’t stop until the animals were broken, whimpering things that couldn’t stand or bark.

The clients wanted them dead. And I didn’t care why as long as money was good.

I placed the helmet back on its charging dock. The recalibration sequence buzzed to life, red and blue lights flickering across the room. The system needed a few minutes to realign before I could dive back in.

The system wasn’t perfect. The chip in my head synced with the implants that were placed in them weeks ago. During surveillance, we’d dosed her and her boyfriend with an edible—harmless in taste, barely detectable to the body. 

The key ingredient was nanotech, strands of engineered material so thin they were invisible to the naked eye, smaller than a dust mote. Created with an electro-spinning process, these microscopic filaments were folded into their food and swallowed without suspicion. Once in the bloodstream, the filaments traveled through the body, binding to neural pathways. 

The process was painless—no side effects, no warning signs. Over time, they formed a lattice across the brain, allowing my control chip to interface with theirs.

Red and blue lights still flickered.

The walls in my room were covered in posters: *Videodrome*, *The Thing*, *Black Rain* with a grim Michael Douglas glaring under neon rain. *Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3* action figures meticulously lined up on a shelf. Above my desk hung two *Elden Ring 2* posters. A stack of books on alchemy—Franz Marie-Louise von Franz’s works—sat next to an ashtray filled with IQOS butts. The air smelled faintly of leather and burnt electronics.

Charging dock finally made a faint sound. The recalibration sequence was done. 

I slid the helmet back on.

And her eyes opened.

The room around me was gone, but I could still *see*—not through my eyes, but through hers. Her body, limp and cooling on the floor, wasn’t hers anymore. 

It was mine.

I moved her fingers first, flexing them like a child testing a new toy. Then her head, rolling it from side to side to feel the stiffness in her neck. It was clumsy, but it would do. Her body stood now, stiff but obedient, blood dripping from the gash in her temple. Through her eyes, I could see the silhouette of his slumped figure.

The boyfriend sat slumped on the couch, his head tilted back at an unnatural angle. Punctured eye sockets carved into his skull. Blood leaked from the wounds, a sluggish river running down his cheeks and pooling in his open collar.

The muscles in his face had stiffened into something between terror and disbelief, as if he’d died still processing what had been done to him.

The sofa was a crime scene in itself. Blood soaked the fabric in dark, spreading stains, dripping onto the floorboards below. His hand rested limply on his thigh, fingers loosely curled around the handle of a pair of scissors.

My—*her*—body staggered forward, arms reaching out. She swayed unnaturally, her balance compromised by the growing disconnect between the nervous system and my control. It didn’t matter. I just needed her to get close enough.

The dead man’s hand was cold as she pried the scissors from his grip. It took effort—rigor mortis had begun to set in, and the resistance made the task feel even more invasive, more obscene.

Her arm raised, the blades trembling in her hand.

The boyfriend’s body didn’t flinch—it couldn’t. He was long gone. But I drove her fist down anyway, burying the scissors deep into his chest with a wet crunch. Blood spattered her face, her eyes, her cracked lips. The body jerked under the blow, a faint and meaningless reflex, and then stilled.

I pulled the scissors free.

She struck again. And again. Each motion is precise and detached. Not hers. Not mine. Ours.

The sofa was ruined, a tapestry of gore and viscera. Pale hands trembled as they fell to her sides, the scissors hanging loosely between bloody fingers. The boyfriend’s chest was a mangled ruin of collapsed ribs and shredded flesh.

I turned her body away, dragging it back toward the kitchen. Her knees buckled once, and she fell against the counter with a sickening thud, but I caught her, steadying her limbs with a flex of my fingers.

Neural connectivity was still strong. The nanotech lattice held firm, even as her body began to succumb to the damage I’d inflicted.

I flexed my hands, feeling the cold bite of bloodied scissors in my grip.

The client’s message blinked in the corner of the screen.

There was still one more to go.
