My mother's trespasses make me dull.



Last week, I decided to take a walk down the forest trail that lies within the vast woods just outside of my town.



It was a very gloomy and cloudy day. But still warm, especially for October. I walked the long distance to the trail, pondering life, taking notice of the lack of people in the streets. I eventually reached the entrance of the path. I took the familiar walk through the winding trail, skinny, leafless trees surrounding me, 



Nothing but the whistling wind blowing through the air. That was when a slight loneliness began to set in. There were no other people, no squirrels, not even birds anywhere to be seen or heard. 



If it weren’t for the wind and leaves crunching beneath my feet, the sounds of my thoughts would probably be deafening. I always found a special kind of solace in this place. Somewhere, I can let my mind go blank and let the surrounding nature consume me. 



The lack of the familiar sounds of the animals was unnerving. No matter what happened to me, they were always there. But now they’re gone, and I had no idea why.



I tried my best to brush it off. Relatively deep into my walk, I made it to the river that lay in the middle of the forest. The water was murky and anything but the color blue. I slowly stepped up to the edge of it. I sat down and routinely with these walks, I set my bag aside, and I looked at my surroundings, taking in the beauty of the simple sight.



It was still beautiful to me despite it all.



The water below me, despite being almost brown from the surface, was still able to show a reflection of my head. Not my face, just my outline. It wasn’t clear enough to see my physical features. 



For whatever reason. Something compelled me to lean in and try to see my face. At least just my eyes. I leaned in closer, still nothing. 



Please just let me see myself. Please. All I need is to be seen right now.



I gave up eventually. Defeated, I tucked my head into my knees. I looked up to once again take in my surroundings.



My head froze instantly when my eyes noticed something from across the river. I didn’t know what it was at first, but it was obvious it wasn’t there before. I examined the strange figure staring at me from a distance. I saw a white, sphere-shaped thing, surrounded by an alarmingly tall mass of black. From that far away, the white part almost looked like a face.



I stared at the figure. Suddenly, I saw it dart to the left. Moving with horrific speed. It was making its way around the river to me. I didn’t know if it was running on two legs or four. The only thing I knew was that I had to run too. 



I shot up and grabbed my bag, running away, back onto the trail, and back into the maze of paths and trees. My legs felt weak, and a hint of panic ran through my head when the thought of them giving out came into my mind. That thing was faster than I. I didn’t need to be close to it for me to know that. The way it ran wasn’t normal.



As I ran, I noticed the path I was running on was not familiar. I didn’t realize when it happened, but my surroundings changed. It was almost as if I were in a completely different part of the forest I hadn’t seen before. That couldn’t be. I’d walked down this entire trail at least fifty times. How could this have happened? And now of all times.



I continued running, taking random turns and not caring where I went. The only thing I cared about was getting farther away from that shape approaching me. 



That was when I heard something to the right below me.



“Hey, hey, excuse me?”



I stopped running and jerked my head in the direction of the voice. It was a woman. She was beautiful. She had long flowing blonde hair, and she was holding a basket in her hands. I caught my breath as I began to walk down to her. As I got closer, I noticed she was much taller than I.



“I’m a little lost. Do you know your way around this forest?” The woman asked.



I breathed in and out, still short of breath from running.



“I-I don’t know, I-I was walking and then there was something across the water. I don’t know what it was, but I-”



“Whoa, calm down, what happened?” She cut me off.



Almost like her soothing voice cured me of my panic, I started to calm down and took deep breaths.



“Stay calm, what happened?” The woman asked.



“I… I don’t know where I am either.” I responded.“I’ve been here before, but I was running from something, and I don’t know where I am now.”



“Running from what?” She questioned, with a hint of worry in her eye.



“... I couldn’t tell you. I’m just glad to finally see another person.” I answered.



“Well, I can relate to that.” She commented. “This place doesn’t feel right. I've got to admit you gave me quite a scare when I saw you running.”



“Oh… Sorry.” I responded



“No, no, it’s okay.” The woman said, laughing slightly. She took her hand out to shake mine. “I’m Melanie.” 



I shook her hand and introduced myself. “Erin… Can I walk with you, please? ” I asked her with a shake in my voice.



“Of course. I could use the company.” She said with a smile.



Melanie was so comforting. I had almost completely forgotten what had happened earlier. Her presence just made me feel utterly safe. We began walking down the trail together.



“Why were you here?” I asked her.



“I’m looking for my son; he’s in here somewhere,” Melanie answered.



“Oh...” I said. “Does he live around here?”



“Yep. He’s all grown up, quite older than you. He moved away from me about nine years ago. But he still asks his mom to come visit all the time.” Melanie explained.



“Hm… Why didn’t he just invite you to his house instead of asking you to come out here?” I asked.



“Well, to be blunt, he hates his place.” Melanie said, “He says it makes him feel lonely and frustrated. I can’t blame him. A dingy apartment is no place for a young man to live. I always ask him why he still lives there, and he always tells me it’s because he can’t live anywhere else.”



“Oh… Does he not like living with you?” I asked.



“No.” Melanie responded, “Some boys just need their independence from their mothers. It makes me sad, though. I always wish he would decide to live with me a bit longer. I know that’s selfish of me, but it is how I feel.”



I thought about her words for a moment.



“I don’t think you’re selfish for wanting that,” I said.



Melanie giggled, like she was amused by what I said.



“You’re sweet for that. I love him more than life itself. But that’s why I can’t stay with him forever. If you truly love something, it’s best to let it go. And believe in it from afar.”



I went quiet after that, and so did she.



“If you ask me... You sound like a great mother.” I said.



“Thank you,” Melanie responded.



We had been walking for what I’d say was half an hour. The path, no matter how far we walked, wouldn't seem to end. 



I thought of the possibility of what happened. I guess it wouldn’t be insane for me to accidentally run off the path and into a whole new part of the forest I hadn’t seen before. But it still left me confused. I couldn’t have run that far without realizing it.



There weren’t many new things to see as we walked. Other than a small pond to our left with rather clear water. The woman began breathing heavier the longer we walked. I looked at her with worry.



“Are you feeling okay?” I asked.



“Yeah, I’m alright. My legs are just feeling weak today.” Melanie responded.



“Do you need to take a break?” I asked.



“No, no, I’m fine. Don’t count me out just yet.” Melanie said,



I began to worry about her. I trusted her to walk fine. But I worried about her feeling tired.



“Please. I- I think we should take a break.” I said almost like I was begging her to relax.



“*Huff*, fine, if you say so,” Melanie said.



There was a slight hill forming just off the path, with a small clearing. We decided to stay there for a bit. Melanie sat down and placed the basket on the ground as she caught her breath. I sat beside her, relieved that Melanie agreed to rest.



“I think we’re almost out of here. We’ve been walking straight for a long time, we have to be.” I claimed.



“Right, right,” Melanie responded. “I’m sure we will...”



“Do you want me to help you walk?” I asked.



“Aw, you’re too kind. But I’ll be alright.” Melanie quickly responded. “Though I am thirsty.”



“Oh! I have water in my bag.” I proceeded to dig into my bag, attempting to look for my water bottle. When I did, I realized it was empty.



“I forgot to fill it…” I said, embarrassed. I had said it to her so confidently, too.



“Oh, no problem. The water in that small pond down there looked clear enough. I’ll live.”



I looked at her. “Are you sure?”



“Yes, of course. I’m not very high maintenance, and it’s no good being dehydrated.” Melanie responded.



“Alright, then. Whatever you say.” I said.



“Thanks.” She commented happily.



She then proceeded to lean in and hug me. My eyes began tearing up, but I refused to make a noise. I hugged her back. What was this?



After she parted from the embrace, I looked away and mumbled a response.



“Sure thing.” 



I looked at her with a weak smile on my face as I got up and began making my way down the path we came from. She waved to me and smiled back. 



“I’ll be waiting right here. I promise.”  She said.



After I began walking away, I felt kind of weird. I only met Melanie about an hour ago, but it felt like so much longer, as if my perception of time had been sped up infinitely. 



All the stress in me had left my body, and I felt so happy. I made my way to the small pond, and it looked beautiful. There was a tiny bit of dirt in it, but it was mostly stone at the bottom, which made it look cleaner. I carefully walked down to it and scooped the clear water into my bottle. 



I closed the lid and made my way back down the path to meet up with Melanie. But as I continued down the path and looked to the small clearing we had been sitting in. I scanned it to find Melanie gone.



There was absolutely no trace of her left behind. No basket or anything. I stood there in utter shock. I wondered why she would leave. My mind raced, wondering where she could’ve gone. Further down the path?



As soon as that thought ran across my head, I ran down the path farther into unknown territory, and I couldn’t see her at all, though. She would’ve had to move fast for me not to be able to see her through the skinny trees. I continued running, horrified that I’d lost her. I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to see her again. 



But she promised. She promised me that she wouldn’t leave.



I ran, but I felt sick thinking that she might’ve been back in the clearing we were sitting in. I was questioning if I had lost my mind. Where in God's name was she?



I shouted out loud, “Melanie!?”



Just then, I started to smell smoke, and I heard some kind of gas oven-type noise from behind me, almost like a fan blowing air. Dumbfounded, I turned around.



And then I saw it. The most horrific and traumatizing thing beyond my imagination.



I saw the figure that was staring at me from beyond the lake. I could see now that it was this four-legged, black creature. It was standing on two legs, despite the clear fact that it wasn’t meant to be from its stature. It towered over me, though it was looking off to the side, not facing me.



Its face, the white thing I had seen earlier, was nightmarish. It almost resembled a deer skull, though part of it was covered by the black, fluffy hair covering its head. It was a filthy and disgusting shade of white, that shade matching its disturbingly sharp teeth. But I couldn’t yet see its eyes. 



Despite its already nightmarish appearance, the uncanny and mind-boggling thing about it was, it was wearing a pink apron, with floral designs on it, and a matching pink, floral hairnet. 



It was holding a pan above a pink and beige-colored oven with a fire underneath the stove top. It was cooking something. My heart felt as if it had completely stopped when I saw what was in that pan.



It was Melanie’s severed head. Her luscious blonde hair had been reduced to nothing more than wiry strands on her skull. Her eyes had been completely removed. And her face was contorted into a state of permanent shock and terror.



I looked just beyond the stove to see a pink table with a wooden cutting board on it. There lay everything else that belonged to her body. Her arms, legs, and torso, all in completely mangled heaps. The figure grabbed a butcher's knife from the table and began hacking away at her severed arm, throwing all of the excess waste from the body into Melanie's basket that lay beside it.



The figure then moved its hand to turn off the stove, stopping the fire that had now turned Melanie's head charred black and smoking. The smell of Melanie's scorched head permeated my nose. 



It froze for a second, and then turned its whole body to face me slowly. It's few, gradual footsteps thundering through my eardrums as it turned to face me. I could now see its face entirely, or lack thereof, I should say.



It had no eyes, a mass of bone covering where they should be, yet I could feel it watching me. The only distinguishable feature of its face was a set of sharp, jagged teeth. Its full attention was on me now. It then reached over to Melanie's other arm on the cutting board, raised it, and violently shook it, obviously trying to imitate a wave to me. It then stopped abruptly and slowly lowered its hand back down to its side.



I looked at the creature for what felt like forever. I stared into its eldritch face almost if I was trying to see past its face and into its true being as it stared back at me, with no emotion coming from its unchanging expression.



I turned my head to my left. 



And I slowly began to walk away. 



It didn’t try to stop me.



I moved further and further into the forest, staring at the ground below me. I saw the same pond that I retrieved the water from, and approached it. This clear water. It sings to me. I stared at the rocks below. I can see my face now. And it all becomes clear to me, as the bubbles stop. My mother's eyes no longer stare back at me.



My hands loosen around her neck, and I remove them from the bathtub.
