Mike Harrison disappeared last week

 

That's what everybody is saying



But I know the truth. 



Mike and I used to be friends for a long time. I use the word ‘used to be friends’ because we kind of had a falling out between each late into freshman year of HS. Although we were friends up to that point, almost all the memories I can remember came when we were in 2nd grade. 



Mike was a loner, I wasn't.



I have no idea how we became friends, but I do remember sitting with him at lunch all the time, always being his partner for projects, and always hanging out at his house after school. Mike’s house was at the end of a street, and I always remembered how green his front yard looked. Dark green leaves covering trees, with light green grass littering at the base of the trees, always moving with the wind. I felt safe and calm there, and that's probably the only reason why I even hung out at his place.



I didn't like his older brother, however. Mike would always tell me,



“He’s a freak man, not nothing will change that. He and his friends scare me, and they scare Mom and Dad too, they always go in his room yelling and screaming, only for him to yell back and hit either them or a wall… I don't like being near him when he does that”



Mike’s view of his brother rubbed off on me, I guess. I would always have him in the corner of my eye, always wary of him. I remember I had to go to the bathroom one time, and I passed by his brother's door (it was open). All I saw was his brother sitting in front of a computer, staring at a blank page. That creeped me out a lot and only caused me to stay further away from him.



Other than that, though, I really enjoyed being at Mike’s house. We could do anything really (his parents weren't really around). Behind Mike’s house was a huge forest (where we usually played) and right behind the forest was a ravine. This ravine had a hiking trail connected to it, therefore making it a very popular hangout spot for teenagers. Because of the popularity, some of the teenagers started creating stories that they would pass around through word of mouth. Almost all of them were stupid, except one that still holds on in my mind even today. 



*The story starts off detailing the troubles of one particular pioneering family. The Father of the family was quite older than his wife, who everyone considered to be quite pretty. The family would travel from town to town, with the men of each town rushing to court the young wife, only to be met with disappointment when learned that the young wife was married to the older gentleman and had already started a family with him* 

*One day, the family stops by a town (the specific town that I live in, right near the ravine), hoping to resupply and make their way to California. They wanted to cross by the ravine, but were warned by the townspeople of Indians with hanging flesh and bony bodies coming out of the ravine to hunt at night. These Indians would hide during the day, but during the night, they would lure all sorts of things through imitation of sounds. Once the unsuspected victim is within their reach, they would drag these poor victims to the bottom of the ravine, where they would steal their flesh and add it to their rotting corpses. The townspeople warned this family to not get close to the ravine at night, ignore all sounds, and keep a watchful eye on any ‘humans’ facing away from them. Those were the Indians, who couldnt reveal themselves (not yet) during the day and were stalking their next victims.* 



*The family, incredibly scared, thanked the townspeople profusely and carried once more on the trail. But they were foolish, and at night, oblivious of dangers around them, they stopped. That's when they heard it. Their dead Grandfather, calling from beyond the brush. One of the young children ran into the forest, swayed by the sound, and then another and another and then their last child ran, calling for his dead grandfather's name. Eventually, the young wife surrendered to the never-ending calls, and all of that party that remained by the wagon was the Father. He was not swayed by the calls, but was determined to find his family. The calls led him to the ravine, and as he walked down into it, he couldn't help but notice someone standing by the calm water. He recognized the dark hair from where he was standing, it was his wife. He called for her, and yet she did not turn around.*



*He called for her once more, still no movement, so he walked closer to the figure, and as he did it finally turned around, and the Father had seen no such terror before.* 



*The face*



*The face was awful looking.*



*Parts of the face had flesh from one child, and other parts had flesh from another child. The Father was horrified to see that  there was new flesh, dripping with blooding, hanging onto the face.* 



*It was his wife’s.*



*But the Father saw something more than pounds of flesh loosely making a face. He saw a rotting corpse, smiling with hate, knowing its awful facade had worked on the man, and the Father knew he was staring at his demise. There, screaming with agony, the father was dragged to the bottoms of the ravine, never to be seen again. It is said that you can still hear the Father’s screams in the forest, if you are quiet enough. It is also said that if you look across the ravine and into the brush, there is something there, looking at you, careful not to reveal itself in the daylight, but knowing it has full control of the forest at night.*



When we learned about this, we were obviously freaked out. The idea of something false, yet wanting to be the real thing, wanting to trick you into believing it’s real, is horrifying. It freaked Mike out more than me, at least,  that’s what I thought. Like I said before, me and Mike had a falling out (sorta?). He went his way and I went mine, and it stayed that way until  two weeks ago, whe  he messaged me; 



XxTerminatorxX: Hey man you free?



MarleyBOb: Yeah I’m free, need anything?



XxTerminatorxX: I know this is going to sound weird, trust me you wont tell anyone about this 



MarleyBOb: Sure whatever, so… 



MarleyBOb: what do you need?



XxTerminatorxX: Like I said before, this gonna be weird, but I joined a forum talking about the stupid ravine behind my house



XxTerminatorxX: I joined it because obv I wanted to know if the story was true or not, and was just looking for some confirmation



MarleyBOb: and?



XxTerminatorxX: The whole forum was a big joke made by some stupid jackasses



XxTerminatorxX: everyone was sarcastic, telling people those indians were coming to their house at night, trying to get in, but there was one person that stuck out



XxTerminatorxX: he wasn't like the rest, he was really different. He knew a lot about those indians, and comment long paragraphs talking about them, and I mean these were like essay level comments



XxTerminatorxX: but one day, he kind of went insane, talked about how the Jurassic Park movies were hiding stuff, the Feds were hiding stuff… blah blah blah, but it was freaky dude, he replaced every comment with shit like that



XxTerminatorxX: people were making fun of him, but like I said before, I was looking into stuff like this, and so I decided to message him



MarleyBOb: What did he say?



XxTerminatorxX: He was talking funny dude, like hieroglyphs but in text, none of the shit he spat out made any sense



XxTerminatorxX: but he kept mentioning this “his majesty” and kept mentioning to look beyond the east, that this thing that he calls ‘his majesty’ is coming down or whatever



XxTerminatorxX: BUT NOT ONLY THAT, he kept mentioning this person named ‘moses’ and how they will proclaim his majesty's kingdom before his holy kingdom comes down. I asked him about the ravine and he said thats where ‘his majesty’ will reside, and that really, really freaked me out



XxTerminatorxX: because who the hell is this moses and majesty guy??? Is this dude going insane? 



MarleyBOb: idk man, I probably wouldn't believe it if I were you



XxTerminatorxX: Yeah well I that's what I was thinking, but then this guy told me about this dude this one ‘king’ , how he is the lord of the north star, the true king, and the sent me a article talking about him, linking this dude to the old ravine 



XxTerminatorxX: ‘*The true king of the north resides in the north star. He is followed by thousands of spirits who play all kinds of instruments, with the King revealing himself after these instruments are played’* 



*‘The king of the north can portray itself as anything, always careful to not to show its true identity wherever it goes, hence coining its term “The False God”, however, this King never portrays himself as the god almighty, but a ‘lesser’ version of himself’*



*‘As shown above, The king of the north does not poetry himself as God, so who is he? The king of the north’s true identity has been detailed over thousands years by people who have invited him into their presence’ Most detailing him as a ‘silver coloured’,  incredibly large man with a horribly discoloured face with a crown erupting from the sides of his head, who will grant promises to those who accept him as their true saviour’*



*‘Many instances of things that portray themselves as ‘false’ in folklore can be contributed to the king of the north, (mentioned before) that he appears in many different forms, rarely revealing his true identity’*



*‘Now to the true meat of the story, how do you call upon him? The king of the north would like to have his presence known throughout the house, so open all windows, doors, anything that will shut the outside world out. Call all family members to you, and have them wait for his presence as well, start  have light all throughout the room in which you are in. If you have done all these things, be ready for his soon arrival, listen to all his commands…*



*If you have done everything mentioned, good luck, and all Hail the King of The North’*



XxTerminatorxX: I did it



MarleyBOb: what?? Why would you do that, thats creepy and cultish and demon-like



XxTerminatorxX: I was scared, but I didnt drag my family into it, it was just me, but I think I screwed it up and Im fucking scared right now. I keep seeing my dead grandmother just standing there at the edge of the forest, just looking at me and wanting me to come to her. It’s not just her though, I keep seeing other people that look dead just walking around, all day, all night. I don't know man I might be going insane



That’s what I thought too, at least. I didn't hear from him for at least a week, he never came to school. His friends told me they went by his house and talked to him and all he responded with was gibberish, like his mind was fried. He said there's something in the forest making clicking sounds and didn't like them, and that freaked them and they took off. Mike called me two days ago and said 



“Haven't been getting enough sleep… keep hearing things whispering in the walls, but that's just not it, I keep waking up on the floor, maybe I was falling off my bed.. Idk, but one day I woke up outside my house (he slept walked a lot) and I had this really funny feeling that I there was 1000 eyes looking right back at me, from all directions” 



Mike and I knew he invited something over that wasn't meant to be invited. Yesterday he asked me to come over, and so I did. When I got there, Mike was standing in the garage, holding a gasoline can.



“I saw that thing last night, I’m going to kill it tomorrow, but I really needed someone over to help give me a sense of security, y’know?”



“Sure” 



Mike is definitely brave( to challenge something so powerful) but I, for one, am not. 



I consulted it 



Its words are pure, pleading with me, promising gifts that no other would have offered. It had the face of my mother, calm, with a sense of sadness. I couldn't let it go



And tonight, as I stand, with a pillow in my hand, I stare down on a defector. A denier of riches, a denier of peace, a denier of calmness



All hail king of the north
