Hello, my name is Justin, i had a scary experience where me and my friends apparently took a wrong turn on a road trip, I really want to think that this was not real, but we are 3 people who all remember it the same way, so i think no matter what, this is the truth…

This happened just last weekend. I’m still wrapping my head around it, and part of me is hesitant to even share this, but maybe someone out there can make sense of what we saw.

I had just finished a midterm marathon and wanted a break, so my friends Ethan, Sarah, and I decided to do a road trip upstate. Just three college kids, a tank of gas, some good tunes, and plans to camp out under the stars. It was supposed to be a fun, carefree trip. Nothing heavy. Nothing... horrifying.

We’d been driving for hours, the kind of drive where you lose track of how long you've been on the road, getting drowsy from the hum of the engine. We were somewhere off the main road—my phone had lost service ages ago—when Ethan, who was driving, missed an exit. Instead of turning around, he just kept going, swearing he’d find another route back.

A small road forked off to the right, almost hidden under tree shadows, and Sarah, half-jokingly, suggested we take it. I don’t know if it was the thrill of the unknown or the exhaustion creeping up, but Ethan took the turn without a second thought.

That’s when everything changed.

The trees closed in around us, dense and towering, like the forest was swallowing the car. The road was narrow and winding, barely enough space for one vehicle, and lined with thick underbrush. We joked at first, calling it “Creepy Lane,” laughing about how we were driving straight into a horror movie. But the jokes died fast when we noticed something strange about the trees.

They were… wrong. I know how that sounds, but they seemed twisted, like their trunks bent unnaturally, gnarled and warped, with branches reaching out like claws. And every few feet, we’d see scratch marks in the bark, deep gouges, as if something with claws had raked through them.

There was no other sign of life—no birds, no insects, nothing. Just this dead silence that felt so thick it pressed on our ears. We rolled the windows down to try and get some fresh air, but the air was stale and cold, way colder than it should’ve been for that time of year.

After a few minutes of driving down that road, we saw it: a small clearing with an old, abandoned building that looked like some kind of ranger’s station. It was strange because there were no trails, no signs of it on any maps we’d seen, and nothing that even hinted people had been here in years.

The weird part? The lights were on.

A single yellow bulb flickered above the door, casting a sickly glow over the entrance. Against all common sense, we parked and decided to check it out. Ethan figured we’d come this far, might as well see what was inside. Sarah wasn’t thrilled about it, but she didn’t want to be left alone in the car, so the three of us crept up to the entrance.

As we stepped inside, the smell hit us first—a foul, metallic odor that made me gag. It was this mix of rot and rust, like blood and old, damp wood. The place looked like it had been abandoned for decades: papers scattered everywhere, broken furniture, a thick layer of dust over everything. But in the center of the room was something that made my stomach drop.

It was a map. A massive, hand-drawn map of the forest, pinned to the wall with strange symbols etched around certain areas. Some of the symbols were smeared in what looked suspiciously like dried blood. There were small, faded Polaroids pinned around the map, showing what I can only describe as… figures. Blurry, half-caught glimpses of shapes that didn’t look fully human. They had twisted limbs, elongated bodies, and faces that were just blank, smooth, and wrong.

Ethan took a step closer to the map, but the second he did, we heard it—a low, guttural growl from somewhere outside. It wasn’t an animal. It sounded distorted, like something trying to mimic a growl but failing.

“Guys, we need to go,” Sarah whispered, her voice shaking. But it was too late. The front door, which had been wide open when we came in, slammed shut. We all froze, staring at each other, panic setting in. Then, the sound started again, this time closer, coming from right outside the walls.

We huddled together, backing up toward the far wall, when we saw something through the dirty window. A figure was moving through the trees. It was tall, way too tall to be a person, with long, spindly arms that seemed to reach out toward the building. Its face—or lack of one—was smooth, just like the photos.

Ethan grabbed my arm, pulling me toward a door at the back of the station, and we sprinted. We didn’t stop to look back, just kept running, our footsteps echoing through the empty hallways. We burst out the back door and kept running through the woods, branches whipping against our faces. All I could hear was the sound of that thing crashing through the underbrush behind us, like it was hunting us, drawn by our fear.

I don’t know how long we ran, but eventually, the sounds faded, and we found ourselves back on the main road, near our car. The clearing, the ranger station, everything—it was gone. Like it had never been there.

We piled into the car, and Ethan floored it out of there, none of us saying a word. The road stretched endlessly in front of us, and for a moment, I thought we were safe. But then Sarah screamed.

I turned to look where she was pointing, and my heart dropped. In the rearview mirror, that figure—the tall, spindly thing with smooth, blank features—was standing in the middle of the road. It wasn’t running or chasing us. It didn’t have to. It was just… there, a black silhouette against the headlights, watching as we sped away.

But no matter how fast Ethan drove, it stayed in view. Every bend in the road, every twist and turn, it was still there, growing larger, closer.

The headlights began flickering, and the car stuttered like the engine was choking. "No, no, no!" Ethan yelled, slamming the steering wheel. The car sputtered and died right there in the middle of the road. The only light came from the dim glow of the moon and the pale beam of Sarah’s phone flashlight.

“Stay in the car,” Ethan said, but we all knew that wasn’t an option. The thing was approaching, each step slow but deliberate.

In a panic, we bolted into the woods, not knowing where we were going. My legs ached, lungs burning as I pushed past branches and roots. The others were ahead of me, their silhouettes barely visible. I don’t know when it happened, but my foot caught on something, and I went down hard, my knee slamming against a jagged rock.

Pain shot through my leg as I tried to get up, but it was useless. The sharp, cold sensation of blood trickling down my shin made me want to scream, but I bit down hard, not wanting to draw attention. That’s when I saw it—the figure stepping into the faint light of the clearing I had fallen into.

It tilted its head, almost curiously, its long limbs twitching as it crouched low. I could hear its breathing, or maybe it was mine, shallow and fast. My entire body froze, panic taking over, but as its clawed hand reached toward me, Ethan came barreling out of the darkness with a heavy branch. He swung it with all his strength, connecting with the thing’s arm. It let out a sound that I’ll never forget—something between a scream and a roar, like static and nails on a chalkboard combined.

Ethan grabbed me under my arm and half-dragged me back into the woods. I couldn’t feel my injured leg anymore, but I forced myself to move, adrenaline pushing me forward. Sarah was waiting near the road, waving her phone flashlight frantically. “Come on! Come on!” she screamed.

We burst out of the woods and back to the car. Somehow, the engine roared to life when Ethan turned the key again, and we sped off, leaving the figure behind. Or so we thought.

Even now, I’m not so sure we left it behind. My leg is healing, but the scratch marks on the car haven’t faded. Sometimes I feel like I’m being watched, especially when I’m alone. And at night, I hear faint, distorted growls outside my [window.](https://youtu.be/URIXrbqKdBs?si=f1LduYEHpVDZk5qP&t=2211)
