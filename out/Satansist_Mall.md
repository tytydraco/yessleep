Recently me and my cousin started getting into Urbex and we were looking for some place big to explore, some friends of ours told us about a big abandoned shopping mall in the middle of big city that seemed pretty exiciting so we wait till night took our gear and went on to explore it.

When we got there was something odd about that place, it felt diferent from other places we explored  other then the liminal creepyness this places tend to have, however we couldn't put our fingers over what give that creepy aura. We got in anyway and we wish we didn't.

Inside the mall we were still feeling that threatening aura, but we were having too much fun exploring the old abondoned shops and structures to care about that as we explored we came across something chilling, in the office part of one shop one of the doors was closed and from underneath it the soft flickering light that comes from candles. I still tried to rationalise it, maybe be a hobo couple love den... we just have to go back without they noticing us. But there was no noise coming from there and my curiosity would not let me simply just go, so I put my ear against the door and... nothing my cousin told me that was enough we should go but i decided to check out when I opened the door there where 9 people standing around a pentagram  in the ground with full body cloaks. We didn't even tought about and ran as fast as we could and they followed by walking after us when we took our eyes of them and look foward there was a big man with a club so  I  kicked one of the windows out of its frame we were on the 3rd floor so it was a big drop my cousin jumped first when I went to jump my shirt got grabbed the man caught up to me he hit me in the head with the club knoking me out.

I woke up in different place inside some kind of old shed tied to a chair without my shirt and weird symbols drawn in my torso and a big scar on my chest which is stiched that look like they were made by a professional in an hospital, I had many questions but didn't want to fuck around and find out.

I  kinda stand up and ran backwards to the wall to break the chair, then i tried the door and uh unloked. I was in a farm in the middle of nowhere I walked for about two hours before getting somewhere people could ride me to the hospital.

The police went to check and they just found my cousin things whitout him there, as for me I went to the doctor and his diagnose weirded me out to the bone, they swapped my heart with another one and after the doctor took a dna sample, it is my cousin heart, WTF!!! we still looking for my cousing and the motherfuckers who did that, I hope he is alive.
