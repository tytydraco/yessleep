Back when i was little, i used to get stuck inside my dreams very frequently. This doesn't happen anymore because I've found a few tricks to force myself awake, such as controlling my body outside of the dream to throw myself off the bed, or hijacking control by going berserker on anything that comes near me inside the dream. Either that, or just sleep enough to not be able to dream.

Anyways.

When i was really small, probably around 4 or 6, it wasn't big deal, since my childsh mind couldn't process any kind of horror, and thus the most threatening thing i could dream at the time was getting chased by a swarm of bees while my childhood friend called me a crybaby. I remember that was the one time i used the 'going berserker' technique for the first time, by screaming "I'm not a crybaby!" Repeatedly until i woke up still screaming the same thing.

I didn't really have any problem with the situation of having to escape my dreams every time i slept, because it was usually something very innocent and childsh. But then, around 13 years old, my brain started to process all the brutalities I've been living on my everyday life (I'm not gonna say my situation, so I'll just leave it at "i went through a 5 year-long depression, after multiple traumas involving my childhood finally sunk in when i was 13").

I began to have hyperrealistic dreams, a lot of them were depressing or terrifying and that just destroyed me even more: the fact that I couldn't feel safe even inside my dreams. Some of the depressing dreams that i can remember include:

1-I was in the middle of an empty black void full of fog, with only an invisible floor beneath me. Suddenly, a figure of someone slowly slides out of the fog, pointing at me and repeatedly saying "i wish i were you, i wish i were you, i wish i were you", that person had a distorted appearance.

2-There was a bunch of kids playing soccer outside, i was sitting on a bench and there was a fence with a single gate separate me and the other kids. At some points, the ball they were playing with would fall on my side and i would give it back to them, only to be met with insults and complaints. Then, at the end of the dream, this time i think i was pissed off and threw the ball on the ground, so they ganged up and beat me to death.

Anyways, back into topic, the scary parts:

At some point, perhaps with a month of delay between dreams, there was 3 specific nightmares that fucked me up (and a bonus one, for honorable mention). 

Note: I'm currently in the middle of pitch darkness on my bed as i write this on my phone, and recalling the memories is making me afraid, I'm also hearing some noises that are disturbing me. So I'll apologize ahead of time for writing mistakes and exaggerations; I'm disturbed.

1st nightmare: "It's me! It's... Me? PLEASE WAKE UP PLEASE WAKE UP PLEASE WAKE UP"

It was just another pitch black night like usual for me, i laid on my bed and waited until my grandma turned off the tv so i could sleep (we share the room, sleep different beds), and then I immediately dozed off when the tv was off and there was no longer any light in the room (take in mind, this applies to the other dreams, too, so I won't repeat this description of the scenario).

When i went to sleep, everything went black as always and i was hoping that, perhaps, i could have a relaxing dream or just don't dream at all this night. However, when my vision came back, i was confused: i was still looking at my room, perhaps i hadn't gone to sleep yet? Well, i thought so at first but... Taking a better look, I wasn't laying on my bed, yet i was. I was looking at myself from across my room while i was sleep on my bed.

"Oh hey, that's me!" I wondered, i thought it to be an astral projection, so started moving myself but... No matter what I did, my perspective didn't change. Slowly, my vision started to approach me on it's om and that's when i realized: my point of view was the place where i usually saw strange things on my room, silhouettes moving on the darkness that freaked me out.

The thing that was looking at me was not me, there was something approaching me in my sleep while i was stuck seeing their perspective (like some sort of "reverse" paralysis demon?). I started freaking out and, as i did so, i could see my body moving frenetically on the bed. When i realized i could move my body outside of the dream, I didn't hesitate to punch myself awake.

After i did "reverse knock out" on myself, i immediately hid beneath the sheets and remained awake until the next morning.

Notes: although this nightmare is not so scary, i thought it deserved to be mentioned, since it was the first instance of me getting inside an actual nightmare and also the first time i managed to wake up by moving outside of the dream.
------------------------------------------------------
2nd nightmare: "Wanna play? Wanna search? *Wanna bet?*"

This was the WORST nightmare I've had in my entire life. This is the one that's scaring me while i write this.
I was NOT ready for that nightmare and i still rank it as the worst experience in my whole life, coming on top of all my childhood traumas as "the definition of fear". It's that bad.

Making it quick:
At the start of my dream, i was walking inside my house all the way to my older brother's room, it was another pitch black night. My brother was booting up the Playstation 2 we had before he realize i entered the room, the game he put was GTA San Andreas.
When he looked at me, he put a pouty face and asked "Oh, you wanna play?" To which i responded that i just wanted to watch him play, that eased him.
As the game was loading, i picked up the game's cover and pointed at it while talking to him casually.
"Ah! You're playing GTA San Andreas?" I exclaimed entusiastically and continued: "Did you know this game is full of mysteries and easter eggs? There's even a few images hidden inside the game's code!"
He brushed my off with a tiredly "Yeah, okay"
I insisted "Really! I can even show you if you just let me borrow the memory card real quick! Don't wanna me to search?" And then i quickly ran to my pc and inserted the memory card to pass download some images on my phone (ignore the logic in this, it's still a dream).

I quickly opened the game's folder and just selected every image, then clicked to download everything. This took a reeeeaally long time, until, eventually, there was only one photo left to download. That photo was taking a lot longer than the others, almost not downloading at all. I don't remember if i did it, but the image opened up and started to slowly load, pixel by pixel, up to down.

The first thing that appeared on the image was a forest, again in the middle of the night. The air was left with a dark blue tone.
Second thing that appeared is still very confusing to me, but i can tell it was definitely gore. A lot of it. My brain was capable of processing blood and viscera at the time, but that gore was beyond that.
I took the freedom of calling that thing the "Molten Reaper". Because it looked like the image of death itself, taking the shape of a woman on a bloodied, now barely white, dress; she looked like, if an AI were prompted to put every cause of death on a single person, that image would be it.

(Just so i can clear this out of my mind about the Molten Reaper's appearance: i am *absolutely* sure she was wearing a white dress beneath all the bloodstains, because the little amount of white standed out in darkness. The red that i saw was *definitely* a lot of gore that was still incomprehensible to me. I *think* she was standing and carrying something behind her, looked like a scythe. The closest i can describe her injuries is as if someone was walking with their flesh constantly melting and falling apart.)

Back to the scene: when the image fully loaded, it instantly closed and the images had all been transferred to my phone. Then i quickly ran to back to my brother, my phone in hands, exclaiming "brother, brother! You gotta look at this! This image was really scary, it was in the game!" And then i shuffled through the gallery repeatedly... Only to find nothing. The image was gone. "Hmmmm... What? I swear it was here-"

After that, I don't remember exactly, but i think looked at a window for a split second and saw the exact same image staring at us, before the dream was abruptly cut to a black screen with the text "that night, the brothers died within seconds." And i immediately woke up, so it was over... Or i thought it was over.

I was terrified, shaking, i wanted to laugh it out. So i decide to mock the ending of the nightmare.
"Haha- hahahaha! Pffffft... Died in seconds? Stupid dream, n-no one dies that fast!"
My mockery was immediately followed by a rough, crispy demonic voice near my ear that said loud and clear in the most threatening tone there could be: "Wanna bet?"
Needless to say, i could've shat the bed right there and then if I hadn't completely froze every cell in my body as i felt my soul leaving... But it didn't feel like the natural "soul leaving out of fear", it felt like something was deliberately *taking* my soul away, like something was *genuinely* trying to kill me. I think i even felt some sort of untouchable weight on top of me, I don't know what it was: my eyes were closed the entire time since i woke up, i was afraid something was waiting for me to open eyes, i didn't know what it was and I didn't want to know. But I'm sure that i was awake because i could feel my body and everything that was happening.
At some point, i felt the weight shift slightly, so i gathered every force i had left in me to pull the bed sheets over my whole body, locked away every possibility of taking the sheets off of me. Then i whispered "I can die really fast, i can die really fast, i can die really fast" to myself the whole night until the sun came up.
------------------------------------------------------------

Anyways, It's really late right now and i have stuff to do tomorrow. I should go to sleep now, specially because i just started to few a weight on my bed and my cat has been acting strange. I'll probably post some sort of follow up with the 3rd nightmare + 2 bonus dreams, since they don't mess with me as much a that previous one.

Hopefully, writing this won't trigger a nightmare.
