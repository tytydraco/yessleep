The fire crackled, sending sparks spiraling into the inky blackness. Maggie grazed nearby, oblivious to the storm raging in my mind. I pulled the small leather pouch from beneath my shirt, the familiar weight of the coin a cold comfort, or perhaps a curse. My fingers traced the strange markings, the silver worn smooth by time and countless touches.

Then it hit me, a wave of foolishness washing over me like icy water. I’d left my chips on the table. All of them. Every hard-earned dollar, every bluff and calculated risk, abandoned in my panicked flight. I groaned, burying my face in my hands. What kind of idiot runs from a poker game, leaving his winnings behind?

“Superstitious fool,” I muttered, the words harsh in the quiet night. Five years clinging to this cursed coin like a lifeline. And for what? Because some ghost story from a grizzled foreman had burrowed into my brain? Because a strange man in a dusty saloon pulled out a matching coin?

A reasonable man would have stayed, played his hand, and walked away with his pockets full. But I wasn’t a logical man anymore. My mind had been tainted with the foolish notion that there were forces at work beyond my comprehension.

I looked at the coin again, its surface reflecting the flickering firelight. It was just a piece of metal, wasn't it? Just an old relic with no real power. The dreams, the stranger, the lingering feeling of being watched - it was all in my head. A product of fear and isolation.

I tossed another log onto the fire, the flames leaping higher, momentarily pushing back the darkness. I needed to get a grip. I needed to stop letting superstition dictate my actions. Tomorrow, I’d find a town, get a decent meal, maybe even find another poker game.

Life would go back to normal.

But as I lay back, staring up at the vast expanse of stars, I heard the sound of footsteps moving through the brush. I slowly reached for my rifle.

The footsteps were soft, deliberate. Whoever was out there was trying to be quiet, but the dry twigs and leaves betrayed their approach. Maggie raised her head, her ears twitching nervously. She sensed it too.

I held my breath, listening intently. The footsteps stopped. Silence. Then, a single snap, like a branch being broken underfoot. It was closer now, too close.

"You got a name?" A voice called out from the darkness.

I recognized the voice. It was the same the low rasp of the stranger from the saloon.

"Who's asking?" I countered, trying to keep my voice steady.

A chuckle echoed from the darkness. "Someone who's been tracking you for a good long while."

I sat up slowly with the rifle in my hands. "Listen mister, I don't know who you are... but if you want to live to see tomorrow you should keep on riding."

"You think a bullet can save you?" he asked, stepping into the half-light completely unarmed.

My grip tightened on the rifle. He was either incredibly brave or incredibly foolish.

"I don't want to shoot you," I said, my voice tight. "But I will if I have to."

He chuckled again, the sound low and unsettling. "You misunderstand, friend. I'm not here to harm you. I'm here to offer you a choice."

He lifted up his hands. "I'm not armed. I just want to talk to you."

I gestured with the barrel, indicating a spot across the fire. "Sit."

He complied, lowering himself with an unnerving grace, his eyes never leaving mine. He was strangely calm for a man looking down the barrel of a gun. His face, etched with the lines of a hard life, betrayed no fear, only a grim determination.

"You can just give me the coin and you'll never see me again." He said staring into the fire.

I wanted to give him the coin. I had been thinking about throwing it into the fire all night.

"But we both know you'll never do that." He said matter-of-factly.

“And if I don’t?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

He stood up, his shadow stretching long and distorted in the firelight. He turned, surveying the vast darkness , the wind whistling softly through the dry grass. “Well, then this pretty little world of yours gets turned upside down.” He paused, then met my gaze again. “And none of us want that."

He opened his hand, palm up, "Now," he said softly, "can I have the coin?"

I considered shooting him right there in cold blood. We were too far from civilization for anyone to know the real story of what happened, but then I also knew he had the answers. Killing him wouldn't solve anything.

I put the put rifle down and pulled out the coin from the pouch, "It's not a coin is it?" I asked.

No,” he responded, his eyes fixed on the coin. “It’s not.”

I turned the coin over in my hand liked I'd done a thousand times before. The idea of being free of it was tempting. All I had to do was toss it to him and I was pretty sure he'd keep his end of the bargain.

"Is Silas with you?" I asked.

The stranger laughed, "Silas doesn't get out much these days."

He squatted down, peering into the fire as if searching for something hidden within the flames. "You know you're getting an opportunity nobody gave me."

And then I remembered he had a coin just like mine.

He looked up, his eyes meeting mine again, a flicker of something – regret? “Not that it would have made much difference.”

"My name is Tyler." I said.

A faint smile played across his lips, “I know who you are,” he answered. "I just didn't want to spook you."

“Who are you?” I asked, studying his face in the firelight.

It took him long time to answer such a simple question, like he was rolling it over in his mind.

"They used to call me Isaac," he replied, his gaze distant, as if looking back across a long stretch of years. "But I haven't heard that name in a long time."

He didn't look that old, maybe late forties, but his eyes held a weariness that spoke of a long road.

"I want to give you the coin." I said, my fingers tightening around it. "But..."

"... you can't." He said finishing my sentence, and nodding.

I tucked the coin back in the pouch and tied it around my neck. I was expecting him to say or do something, but he just sat there in the silence staring into the flames.

"Now what?" I asked, my voice tight with a growing unease.

Isaac looked up at me, a strange sadness in his eyes. "Well," he said, his voice low and urgent, "those dreams you've been having… they’re about to become real."

He stood and turned away from the fire. "You can come with me or stay here and die."

I laughed, "You expect me to trust you... just like that?"

He smiled, "I wouldn't trust me if I were in your shoes, but I damn sure would be wondering how I knew about the dreams."
