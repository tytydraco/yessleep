Hi my name is John I'm a thirty five year old living in the heart of alaska, deep within its forest's. But I too once lived in a the concrete jungle, Los Angeles a beautiful city none the less, filled with hard working people that want to get the most of life and at the same time with people that have been run down by the society that they live in. I was the latter and was a big IT guy working in the software sector for a giant tech company, I got in early on the stocks and made bank. I used the money i made to retire and buy a cabin in the heart of alaska, 20 miles away from the nearest gas station. 


The cabin was a little old but it was renovated. I wanted to have some peace and quiet in my life, to forget about the stress of living in a concrete jungle and getting to read the books I put off for so long. But It was hard getting use to living without the internet or any outside contact, but eventually i did. After a few days I started going fishing by the near by lake and going hunting for dear. But as it dose it gets lonely without any one around hire, so i went to town and got my self a golden retriever i named it drew. I took him every where i went be it fishing, hunting or hiking on the near by trails, but he did one thing that i thought was weird. Every day at dusk he would bark and bark into the abyss of the forest from the window in the kitchen. I didn't understood at first what he wanted, I soon realised that he wanted to go into the forest alone, so i let him. He would allways be back by dawn barking at the back door for me to open. He would allways be back with a stick or something similar. But yesterday was different he brought back a dead rabbit, and the the day after and the day after that, dead rabbits that weren't harmed physically or at least as far I can see. And from that day on I would find dead rabbits every where be it my favourite hill top or fishing spot, around the cabin and sometimes even up in the trees surrounding the nearby trails.

So yesterday dusk befoled again and as always my dog started barking, braking as loud as the my ears could hear. But I knew I couldn't let him out or whatever got those rabbits could get him. That night I fell asleep to my dog barking but the next day I woke up I went to check on him expexting him to have fallen asleep or something of the sorts but he was gone and the back door was wide open. I could swear I had locked bouth of the doors but even if I didint my dog wasn't big enough to open the door by him self, someone had to have opened the door for him. The next few days I searched for him every where but i didnt find anything. And the next day i woke up and went to outside to get some fresh air and when i opened the front door a huge box was waiting for me ouside with no address. I got a razer and opened the box. Inside of it my dogs body layed life less and with the tail and eyes of a rabbit.
