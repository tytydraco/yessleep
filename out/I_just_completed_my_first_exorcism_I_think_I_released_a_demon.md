Despite what people think, exorcists are real. I myself have been one for the past five years. The job is nowhere near as exciting as people think. It’s primarily administrative, and when it’s not, it’s diagnostic. Of the approximately 100 cases I have seen in those past five years, only three have made it into the point of what the public might consider an actual ‘exorcism’. However, like every other part of the process, an exorcism is highly bureaucratic. Many layers of documentation, interviews, research, speaking to friends and family before we even speak to the likely possessed individual. During this process two of the three cases I mentioned before were eliminated, better dealt with by a therapist or psychologist.

As you can likely determine, I have had a single true exorcism in my career. To disappoint, a modern exorcism is just as boring as the rest of the process. Before my priesthood, I was a therapist for 13 years, an experience which I have brought forward into my current work. A modern exorcism is a direct mirror of a therapy session, although more liberal in its allowances.

We exorcists have a saying, “before you treat the demon, you must treat the patient,”

A general exorcism takes place over several sessions, typically between twelve and twenty five. I hate to say it, but I believe this is because none of these cases involved a demon. Many of these sessions will go without any mention of the demon, just allowing the possessed to become comfortable, while supposedly disarming the demon. Certain historical records support these recommendations. However, I will say they do not align with my experiences.

For this reason we also say, “plans rarely survive first contact with the enemy.”

While I have redacted any identifying features, the following text is a recount of my first exorcism, and quite possible the first true exorcism of the 21st century. This event occurred one and a half years ago.

The subject was a young woman, thirty two years old. She was an actuary, successful in her field, and despite the demonic possession, clearly doing well in life. She arrived to the first session dressed professionally, looking entirely put together. Outwardly there were none of the signs one would typically associate with a demonic possession.

**Session 1:**

I purified my office prior to the arrival of the patient, pellets of holy blood placed into the lining of her chair, subtle crosses etched into most furniture around the room, and nothing which could be used as a weapon in reach. Through my intercom I told my assistant to send the patient in. A wave of nervousness ran through my body.

She walked through the door, appearing just as she had in the photos I was sent. A cleanly dressed woman wearing a charcoal grey suit, hair braided into a bun on the top of her head, and a black leather bag in her hand. She smiled weakly at me before taking a seat. “Um… hello Dr. \[my name\]?” Clearly the pellets were having no effect on her.

I returned her smile as warmly as I could, although, like hers I’m sure it was quite weak. “Yes, I am \[my name\], however you can call me Father; do you know why you’re here?”

Her smile was gone, replaced by a dark expression. She returned quietly, “Yes… I … have been told that I’m possessed … sorry that sounds crazy.”

I was not entirely surprised by her response, the prospect of being possessed by a demon is one that most people reject. I tried to reassure her. “Oh please don't feel as though you have to apologize. This is my job.” I continued. “You mentioned that you were told you were possessed. You don’t feel that you are?"

She replied, now almost angry. “At first I thought maybe I was just going crazy, but now, I don’t know, this whole thing doesn't seem fair.”

Our conversation continued for the next 30 minutes, just about her life, what she likes to do, her goals, you get the idea. I tried to steer the conversation away from the possession for a little while, just to get an idea of who she was as a person. However, as the session was coming to a close, I realized there was something she said that I didn’t follow up on.

“One last thing before we wrap up, you said someone told you that they thought you were possessed. Who was that?”

She looked at me for a second, giving a sad little half smile. “Oh. It was the demon.”

I unconsciously stood up, just staring at her. It wasn’t such a strange thing to say in this context, but the way she said it gave me pause.

“Father, are you alright?”

I sat back down again slowly. “Yes, perfectly fine. I just, sorry.” I tried again. “That’s interesting. I have heard of cases like that in my files. I think it’s best that we end here for today. I’ll do some more research on your condition, and we can reconvene in a few days.” “If you have an emergency, or notice any changes in your condition, please give me a call”

She looked a bit worried now; I had broken my composure. “Uh, yes Father, that sounds good.”

She left the room without another word. I watched from the window as, a few moments later, she walked to her car, speaking to someone on the phone. 

I had not expected an exorcism to be simultaneously so calm yet unsettling. Nothing like the movies might lead one to believe.

**Session 2:**

I was resolved to maintain my composure this time. It was a stupid mistake; the lightest hint that something could be amiss had set me off. Again I told my assistant to send her in.

She walked in, a flaming halo of thorns wrapped around her head, her black suit replaced by white linen robes, and a slight golden tint had appeared over her previously warm skin. Her eyes were a pure white and swimming with golden runes that I imagine no one alive could read. She spoke,“Hello Father, how are you doing today?”

My composure was immediately broken. I had not expected such an escalation. “Um.”

Her expression looked utterly cold, but her voice sounded concerned. “Father, are you okay?"

I leaned against my seat and tried to pull myself together. “Uh… Yes,” I stammered. “I’m doing well \[patient\]. Are you feeling okay yourself?”

She turned her stone expression away from me. “I think theres something you haven’t mentioned.”

At this point I was lost for words. I have always been a believer, but the prospect of a demon standing in front of me, especially one who so resembles an angel felt like such a departure from what I understood life to be. I pushed past the outer appearance that I saw, clearly a demonic distraction, but fumbled with my words as I said. “I have no idea what to say in this moment.”

Although her face didn’t move, she almost looked disappointed. She spread out her arms. “I look like a Grigori. You can see it, right?” She tilted her head to the side, her flaming halo flickering as she did. “I was looking forward to this, you know. You’re not as fun as I thought you would be.” She slumped onto the chair. “You know the old priests used to yell at you, and throw water. That was fun! I’ll bet if I didn’t show up like this today it would have been, I don’t know, five more sessions before you even breached the topic.”

I felt a sudden urge to defend my profession. “You know, these methods actually were honed by APA over—” 

I caught myself, my voice becoming harder. “Actually, it doesn't matter. What did you do to \[patient\]?”

She moved her hands to her face, stretching her mouth into a smile. “Oh, I don’t know. I didn't need her anymore so I put her away. It makes it hard to use this body though.”

“Sorry?” I cocked my head. “You did what with her?”

The demon dropped its hand back down, although the smile remained. “Look doc, I don’t want to talk about her. I want to talk about me!”

“No, NO, I will not continue until I know \[patient\] is safe!”

The demon was clearly annoyed, its smiling face taking a sinister tone. “You aren’t in control here.”

The pretence of a therapy session had clearly passed. My mind ran through the exorcist checklist. They became jumbled in my mind, but I stumbled my way into the recitation of a psalm, “My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the—“

“YES, Yes this is what I want, a bit out of order, but now we’re doing it the right way! And you picked my favourite, what a special priest.” Not annoyed any longer, her skin was almost glowing with excitement. Her crown was brighter than before, an almost white flame.

I stopped suddenly. Nothing about the situation made sense. I was in front of a real demon, and it wanted to be exorcised. I couldn’t continue.

In an instant the demon rushed towards me, its hand on my neck, the voice that was once the woman’s coming from an unmoving mouth directly in front of my face, screaming in my mind “YOU DO NOT STOP!”

My skin blistered under her touch. I could feel my throat constricting as she tightened her grip, but I managed to speak, “I’ll do it, but please, just explain it to me…”

Without moving she was back in her chair. “A chance to teach. I will always take the opportunity.”

I reached up to feel my throat; the skin was raw. “Demon, who are you?”

She moved her face again, pushing the smile up further. “I am a Grigori. I am the great P-----e!”

I didn’t recognize the name, but my body pulsed with waves of fear as I heard it.

She continued. “It would seem you don’t know me. I’d suggest you do some research once you finish the exorcism. It’s my greatest gift after all.” She stood up. “I’ve never understood it anyway. By any account, you should worship us. We made you who you are today, but instead, you’ve been killing my friends for the last few millennia.”

She dropped down to the floor, crossing her legs to sit. I pushed through the most recent wave of fear and asked my next question, “What business do you have here?”

“I have no business. You should ask the one who put me here.”

She reached up and closed her eyes before placing her hands in front of her in the supplicant position. At this point I was entirely lost. My body felt as though it was on fire. 

In a thin voice I asked her my final question, “Who put you here?”

The demon didn’t respond. It simply sat there for a minute, entirely unmoving before replying. “This session is over, Father. You should come back tomorrow with your friends.”

I looked towards the door, almost expecting to see people there, but it was empty. When my eyes returned to her, I saw that she was no longer flesh and bone. She was a marble statue, exactly as she had been sitting. A crown of thorns wrapped around her head.

**Between Session 2 and 3:**

I ran from the room into the lobby. My assistant was acting entirely normal, as though he hadn’t seen a woman with a flaming halo walk into my office. Using his phone I called the Bishop's office.

Bishop \[Dawson\] picked up on the second ring, “Hello Father \[my name\], how did your second session go?”

I replied, breathless, “Your Excellency, I have confirmed that the patient is possessed. The demon we are dealing with proclaims to be—“

Bishop Dawson cut me off. “Do not speak its name. Have you begun the rites?”

“I haven’t, I—“

Bishop Dawson cut me off again. “Good. I take it the patient is restrained then. We are on our way.”

I tried to quickly get my words in. “No, the demon is too powerful. I wasn’t able to do anything.” I doubt the bishop had heard. He seemed to have dropped the phone in haste. 

I considered what the Bishop had said. I pressed the button on the intercom. “Please pick up some chains from the hardware store. You can go home after.” I slowly walked back into the office. The demon was still there, just as it had been before, sitting in that supplicant pose. Although wary, I walked around its body. If I had not known better I would have thought it was just a statue.

Two hours later Bishop Dawson and Father Callum arrived at my office. In the setting sun I saw their black car drive up to the building, and the two men step out. The Bishop led the way, his shiny bald head bobbing along like an egg floating in water, Callum trailed behind, arms folded behind his black.

**Session 3:**

The two men practically sprinted into the room, Bishop Dawson clearly out of breath from climbing the stairs, while Callum was as straight as ever. Bishop Dawson doubled over, hands on his knees, red face dripping with sweat. He looked up. “Father \[my name\], where is she?”

I could barely meet his eyes as I pointed towards the statue. The Bishop’s eyes widened as he saw the strange form the demon had taken on. Callum, on the other hand, appeared to have a slight, almost hungry, smile on his face. Bishop Dawson clumsily stepped towards the statue before kneeling down on the floor in the same supplicant position, “Our father who art in heaven…” Callum and I knelt on the floor as well, joining in. “… for ever and ever. Amen”

Bishop Dawson stood up, reaching towards the statue before yanking his arm back. He hastily shoved his arm into his overcoat, producing a pair of white gloves that he quickly pulled on. He again reached out to the statue, running a finger along its shoulder before pulling on the chains that I had attempted to wrap around it. He looked towards me with a seemingly satisfied expression. “You have done well here my son. Tell me, have you heard the demon speak?”

“Y-yes,” I replied, “I don’t believe I ever really interacted with \[patient\].”

“I expected as much.” He nodded, seeming satisfied yet again. “Not to worry my son, this is all very natural. We can begin the rite.” “Your therapy is all well and good for your neurotics, but a true exorcism requires force.”

I considered protesting, but thought better of it.

Callum walked over to the statue, producing a small ampoule of holy water from his overcoat. He raised it in his hand and tossed the ampoule, with surprising effort, into the face of the demon.

The face of the statue shattered with the ampoule, cracking and crumbling as chunks of stone fell away to expose a solid gold iteration of my patient’s smiling face. The demon shifted as the stone cracked, stretching and pulling at the pieces like a lizard shedding its skin. 

Callum stumbled back, nearly running backwards across the room, not taking his eyes off the being in front of him for even a second.

The demon stood up fully, stretching her back and causing the remainder of the stone to fall from her body, crumbling into a fine dust as it hit the floor. The chains that I had hastily wrapped around her were glowing a deep red, as though the transformation was emitting heat, they flowed off of her, pooling onto the ground around her bare golden feet. She now stood in front of us, much larger than before. Her face was a brilliant gold death mask perched in the middle of a white linen headscarf that smoothly flowed into the rest of her porcelain white robes. The most striking change however was the pair of golden wings that extended from her back, surrounded by floating gold runes, the same runes which had previously swum across her eyes. A subtle white smoke emanated from her, and a quiet chorus of unspoken voices began to sing as she stretched those massive wings, blocking the window behind her. It was as though her time as a statue had allowed her to metamorphose into her true form.

Although I couldn’t see his face, I could imagine the innocent expression on his face as Bishop Dawson approached the demon in front of him, “Are— Are— a…?” He couldn’t seem to complete the thought.

The demon looked at him expectantly.

He stared back for a moment before finally choking out in a quiet voice, “Are you … an angel?”

Just as before, her face didn’t move, but you could tell she meant the smile. “Of course, your Excellency.” She knelt down to reach his level before stretching out her hand. He greedily reached out with both of his to clasp it. As they touched Bishop Dawson was gone. It was as though he wasn’t standing there just seconds ago.

It was my turn to stumble backwards. I tripped over the chair behind me and tumbled to the floor. To my right, I saw Callum jolt forwards as he yelled, “WHERE IS HE? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?”

The demon now looked displeased. “Oh, I shouldn’t have done that. We wanted him for the rite, didn’t we."

Callum continued to scream at her, “WHERE IS HE? IS HE DEAD?”

She looked truly distraught. I almost felt as though I wanted to cry just looking at her. I tried to stand but my body felt so heavy. I could barely breathe.

She turned her head to look at Callum. “Yes Father, where else would he be? He is with the Lord. Can you perform the rite without him?”

Callum looked broken. He slumped into my chair. “Why would you want us to exorcise you?”

The demon looked behind herself, taking a few steps back to crouch onto her own seat opposite his. “It should be pretty obvious.” She slouched in the chair, breaking its back off. “Sorry.”

From my position on the floor I felt compelled to respond, “It’s fine.”

She continued. “I have been trapped in these Nephilim bodies for millennium, just because I gave you humans a gift.” “Our lord felt that interaction with humans was a bit uncouth.” She looked wistfully at the ceiling. “I will say, it feels a bit hypocritical since he did all that boat stuff a few hundred years later.” “Didn’t get us though.” She covered an eye with her hand, as though she was simulated a wink.

Callum sat forward in his chair. Although his pale face was puffy and dripping with sweat he seemed to have a certain vitality in his voice. “You want to be released?”

The demon smiled warmly towards him. “Yes. This exorcism process you humans have invented seems to be quite successful when it comes to removing us from our hosts.” 

I managed to pull myself up to my feet again. “The rite destroys demons.”

“Believe me Father, I have done my research.” She stood up as well, dominating the room. “The rite has destroyed Grigori, in the past. Those who exposed themselves too soon. I on the other hand have managed to stay undercover and recover some of my power. God also seems to have gone somewhat… radio silent, which helps.” It paused on the word radio, as though the concept annoyed it.

Callum stood up to match the two of us. “This is very interesting. We need to document this!” He grabbed his bag and began to rummage through it until he pulled out a notebook.

The demon crossed her arms across her chest. “Feel free.”

I walked over to Callum. “Hold on, we aren’t doing this. Why would we free a demon? Why are we trusting anything she says?”

It smiled again. “How’s your throat feeling, Father? Wouldn’t you like to save my pretty child?”

I felt that same compulsion that I had before. Even if the demon could be trusted, we would be performing the exorcism either way. As the church says, you never negotiate with the possessed. My stomach churned and bile back up in my throat but I decided to perform the rite. Callum was clearly convinced, pure bishop material. 

The demon returned to her supplicant position, massive wings now wrapped around her body.

Although I have divulged a significant amount of internal church documentation, I will be redacting the specifics of the rite to prevent untrained individuals from attempting to recreate it.

The rite was entirely clinical. Callum and I ran through the steps, as the demon made no efforts to negatively influence the process. 

As we completed the final step, the demon’s body began to shake. Her golden skin became etched with white fracture lines, and the white linens that covered her body began to rot. Golden skin sloughed off of dark blackened bones as a milky blood-like fluid puddled around the base of her rotten feet, just as the molten metal had previously. The demon’s body unceremoniously decomposed into a pile of flesh in a matter of minutes with no indication that anything had been released.

The experience had taken something from us. Callum and I took turns throwing up in the corner of the room. On my second time in the corner I noticed that a white fog had begun to fill the room. The rotting flesh of the demon was sublimating away in front of us.

I spotted something sticking out of the mound and stumbled towards it. In the midst of the pile was a woman wrapped in a linen shroud. Despite my actions, my patient had survived the rite.

Following the exorcism I left the priesthood. I share this documentation of my experience as a warning to you all. I don’t know what, if anything I have released. If she is out there somewhere, I should not have written this, and you likely should not have read it. However, I just can’t get the demon’s words out of my head. Is God watching over us, or has Heaven truly gone quiet. I don’t know, but when I reach out, all I feel is emptiness.
