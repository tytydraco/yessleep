I sat down with my morning coffee and opened my email. It was bursting at the seams as usual.

I clicked on the first link and started skimming through its contents.

*I grew up in a haunted house… normally used to this stuff… this was the first time I was ever scared.*

Interesting.

There was a video file attached. I clicked on it.

It was a video from a doorbell camera. The video feed looked out onto a beautiful wrap-around porch complete with flower boxes and an American flag blowing in the evening breeze. A few bugs flittered by, but I couldn’t see why I had been sent the video. Then I saw it.

Just barely visible in the darkness, peeking from behind the flower boxes was a face. It didn’t move, you’d think it might be a statue by how still it was, and although about 75% of the face was obscured by the flower box, I could tell it wasn’t human. The skin looked rough, like papier-mâché and the proportions were off. It was a bit uncanny.

The wind blew the flowers in the flower box revealing slightly more of the face. One of the face’s large, unblinking eyes was exposed. Like I said, the proportions were off. It was too big, with no lashes or brow, just a giant white circle with a smaller black circle in the middle. It looked almost cartoony. It started directly into the camera. I started to think someone had just placed a creepy mask in front of the camera until I saw it blink.

A shiver ran up my spine and I had to turn around to check my own surroundings. I have to do that sometimes when I get scared. Just a habit from childhood.

When I turned back to the video screen the face was gone. The video clip ended a few seconds later.

Nope, hell nah. I am not getting involved with whatever that was.

I send a message back:

*Heyyyy,*

*Yuck! Pretty weird, but I can’t help with that, sorry! Maybe try the police?*

I opened the next email.

*We have something in our house. I can’t sleep. I’m worried for the safety of my daughter.*

Blah blah blah.

Another video file was attached.

The video was from a mother’s cell phone as she crept silently through a house. She arrived outside of a bedroom door decorated with unicorns and a sign that read, “Sarah’s room,” in bold letters under which another sign spelled NO BOYS ALLOWED.

I could hear something from the other side of the door. It’s quiet at first, but as the camera draws nearer I could make out the muffled sounds of children whispering to each other and the sounds of toys being dragged across a hardwood floor.

A hand comes into frame as the mother slowly pushes the bedroom door open revealing the messy room of a little girl. Toys are strewn everywhere, Barbies, Hot Wheels and ponies.

The girl who I presume to be Sarah is asleep in her bed.

The mother says quietly to no one in particular, “Don’t disturb my daughter. She needs to sleep.” There are a few seconds of silence. The mother lets out a sigh of relief feeling she’s won this battle. She takes a step towards her daughter, presumably to check on her or kiss her on the forehead, when a low growl fills the room.

“No,” the woman says quietly, but firmly, into the room like a mother would to a misbehaving child. There’s another few seconds of silence, then, like a lightning bolt, a long black arm lashes out from under the child’s bed, grabs a toy from the floor of the room and pulls it back into the shadows.

The mother screams in terror, the daughter wakes up screaming.

The video ends.

Nope. Don’t feel like messing with that one either. I still look under my bed all the time.

I shoot an email back. 

*Pretty Spooky!*

*This isn’t my area of expertise, looks like you might need a priest or a rabbi or shaman or those ‘spiritual’ girls you see at music festivals, but not me!*

*Hope this helps :P*

On to the next email.

*Ever since my roommate passed away, things have been going missing in my house. I think he might be haunting me. Is this a situation you could help with?*

Bingo! Easy Money.

During the pandemic I started a side-gig as an online psychic to earn a little bit of pocket money. It started with Tarot cards and palm readings and has since evolved into…something else. Once COVID restrictions eased I started doing house calls. It’s a fun gig. I make good money and meet some VERY interesting people.

Only thing is I didn’t believe in any of this shit. I would make it all up.

I started off in my Zoom call days by reading a script I wrote with a couple friends after a few beers, I’ve got it memorized now. Actually, I’ve memorized several different scripts now. Sprinkle in a little improv here and there, and I’m as good as the real thing. Honestly, I think I’m just a good salesman. Confidence takes you a long way in this racket.

Sometimes I feel bad and think, “Maybe I should just start selling cars or something,” but I can’t give this up, it’s just too much fun. And it's so easy. 

The thing is, when people lose a loved one, they start going a little bit crazy. They don’t sleep, they forget to eat, they are constantly stressed out dealing with funeral arrangements, grieving loved ones and restructuring their support systems. They get a little bit harebrained and eventually they misplace something. They forget they leave the TV on downstairs and hear voices when they are lying in bed. Sometimes they are so stressed and sleep deprived they straight-up hallucinate.

That’s where I come in. A knight in shining armor.

I tell them it will all be okay; I pass a message to them from their deceased loved one saying how proud they are of the person they have become. I prescribe some hot tea and a good night of sleep and bam – haunting nipped in the bud. The client gets a clear head and fresh start on the rest of their life and I get a pocket full of cash. The placebo effect is the real deal.

I knocked on the door of the tiny shotgun house 2 days later around noon. The door opened and a small Mexican man stood in the doorway wearing jeans and a black T-shirt with Tweety Bird and the Taz the Tasmanian Devil on it. He looked tired.

“Hi! Are you Pedro?” I asked the man.

“Yeah, are you…” He pulled out one of my business cards from his pocket, “Mystical Mike?”

Don’t laugh at the name. Magic Mike was already trademarked and alliteration is a winning business strategy.

“Yup that’s me”

I followed Pedro into the house and found myself standing in the living room. A basic set up with a TV, coffee table, couch and a loveseat. The other side of the room was occupied by a small and dirty kitchen. A small kitchen table bifurcated the two spaces. A short hallway connected the living areas to two bedrooms and a bathroom.

We sat at the kitchen table and Pedro gave me the rundown about what had been happening. His roommate passed away about 2 weeks ago under suspicious circumstances. He was a happy, healthy 28-year-old with a clean bill of health and no drugs in his system. Pedro found him dead in the bathtub. Heart attack was the official cause of death.

Since his passing, Pedro claimed things have been getting moved or going missing. He says he hears his roommate’s bedroom door open and close on its own some nights.

You know, typical ghost shit. This was going to be another easy client.

Now Pedro was Mexican, and Mexican means Catholic. Catholics grow up in a ritual rich environment - Reconciliations, confirmations, the transubstantiation of the communion. If your client is Catholic you can’t just walk around the house burning sage or an incense stick. You need a ritual. You need props.

I carry a bag of props with me to each jobsite. Every type of client needs a different type of prop. Among a few other knickknacks, it’s got a handful of Crystals for the ‘spiritual’ girls, incense and sage for the indigenous, a Bible, Torah and a Quran for the religious, an EMF reader for the skeptics or the scientifically inclined, a couple granola bars if I get hungry, and for the Catholics i have a few crosses and rosaries. I also have a Ouija board. Some clients go crazy for the Ouija.

I pulled out the Ouija board and Pedro’s eyes went wide. I immediately knew this was the right tool for the job. 

“Are you sure about that,” he asked, pointing at the Ouija board, “I heard bad things happen after people use those things.”

“Don’t worry Pedro, you’re in the hands of a capable professional,” I lied, “I know exactly what I’m doing,”

I set up the board between us, lit some candles and burned the end of a stick of incense. Ready to blow Pedro’s mind.

Before starting I had one last question for Pedro, “What was your roommate's name?”

“Archibald”

“Oh god, seriously?” I couldn’t help it.

“Yeah, he went by Arch, so it really wasn’t too bad”

“Ok, yeah that makes sense. Let’s start this thing.”

I placed my fingers lightly on the planchette in front of us and coaxed Pedro to do the same as I started the ceremony. I started by reciting a few Latin phrases I had memorized after taking it as a foreign language in high school. It was mostly nonsense. It started off with the opening line from one of Cicero’s famous speeches that I was forced to recite for an oral exam, followed by a series of pauses and random words.

*Quamdiu mihi consuli designato, Catilina, insidiatus es, non publico me praesidio, sed privata diligentia defendi!*

*Pūmilio!*

*Mea Culpa!*

*Habeas corpus!*

If I ever come across a client who actually knows Latin, I’d be screwed, so it’s a good thing almost no one does.

I switched back over to English.

“Archibald! I call you to witness!”

I started moving the planchette slowly around the board, not landing on anything in particular, just to give Pedro the sense something was happening.

“That’s not you, is it?” Pedro asked, a thin mustache of sweat forming on his upper lip. He shook his head in disbelief, for a guy with a darker complexion he was very pale.

Again, I called out to the ‘spirits’, “Is this this spirit of Arch?”

I began to move the planchette towards the ‘YES’ section of the Ouija board, about halfway there I encountered some resistance. The planchette froze. I couldn’t move it. It was as if it was glued to the board itself. Weird.

Improvising, I called out another question, “What do you want from Pedro?”

My fingers tingled and seemed to grow hot as I tried to move the planchette, still it remained frozen in place. Then, slowly, the wooden planchette drifted to H then E. I glanced up at Pedro to see if he was fucking with me. His face was as white as a sheet of paper and he was taking huge deep breaths like a dying fish as he looked down at the planchette, horrified. I get the sense he was faking.

The planchette continued sliding around the board. K then N over to O then W then S.

HE KNOWS.

Pedro looked up at me for the first time since the ritual began. He was trembling.

“Pedro, what's going on?” I asked him, “What do you know?”

Just then, Pedro and I both pulled our hands back in pain as the planchette erupted in flames. This is when I started to feel like I was the one being conned. I looked under the table for magnets or any type of machinery that could manipulate my planchette. I waved my hand over the flaming wooden disk in case somehow Pedro had managed to rig some sort of thin wire to it. All my searches came up empty.

A primal fear grew in my belly.

The planchette started sliding quickly back and forth across the Ouija board stopping at letters too quickly for us to even register which letter it briefly rested on.

“No mames!” Pedro shouted, “What’s it saying?”

“Uh, I don’t know,” I had no idea what to do in this situation? Ask it to slow down? That made sense, “Excuse me, Ghost? Can you slow it down? You’re going too fast for us to understand you”

The planchette came to an abrupt halt and the small flame extinguished itself just as quickly. A beat later, Pedro and I heard a *Click* from across the room. The television had turned itself on.

*Click click click*

Pedro and I watched in silence as the television flicked through several channels before landing on a random daytime soap opera. It was muted. We watched the characters act out a silent argument on the screen for a few seconds before the TV unmuted itself just in time for one of the characters to shout, “I SAID-”

*Click click.* The TV cycled through some more stations.

Liam Neeson appeared on the screen, “Give me back–”

*Click click click click*

The TV stopped on a wounded soldier in the jungle who screamed, “My Leg!” before the television muted him.

Pedro gasped and clasped a hand to his mouth.

*Click click click.*

The TV stopped again, this time on a man in a beanie in a meth lab. It unmuted itself, “BITCH!”

Pedro got up from the table and walked into his room. I could hear him opening his closet and rummaging around.

*Click click click.*

I sat there in silence while the television started playing the Final Jeopardy music.

The whole experience was just too bizarre. I could feel everything I had known about the world melt and re-arrange itself in my head. What did any of this mean? What powers have I been tempting and tampering with the past few years, and worst of all – were all those emails I get everyday actually legitimate? I felt like someone had just poured ice water down my back.

I had figured they were just people pranking me. People who figured I was conning people and wanted to poke a little bit of fun.

I quickly packed the Ouija board and was about to leave the house, when –

*Click click click click*

Kendrick Lamar popped up on the screen, “Sit down. Be Humble.”

I sat my ass back down at the kitchen table. A few moments later Pedro walked back into the room carrying a disgusting looking prosthetic leg. He dropped it onto the table with a loud thud.

*Click click click click click*

“BURN IT” the television shouted; I didn’t see what was on the screen.

*Click click click.*

Samwise Gamgee was on the screen now, shouting at Frodo, “Throw it in the fire!”

Pedro pulled a lighter out of his pocket and moved towards the leg.

“Wait,” I said to him, “I’m not sure that is a good idea”

Pedro looked confused, “If we give it what it wants, won’t it leave me alone?”

He was desperate, and I understood that. The past 10 minutes had completely shattered my entire worldview, even so, I had watched enough movies to understand that when dealing with an entity like this, you shouldn’t blindly bow to its will. Giving an evil entity something that it wants might only serve to make them more powerful allowing them to tighten their grasp on you.

“I’ll take it,” I said reflexively. It was the first solution that entered my mind. I didn’t want to take it, but that seemed like the path of least resistance to get the hell out of this house where I couldn’t think.

“Be my guest,” Pedro pushed the leg towards me and pocketed the lighter.

The television was screaming at me.

*Click click*

“Idiot”

*Click*

“Fool”

*Click click click click*

“…What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you…”

I tossed the leg into my bag and headed towards the door.

“Wait,” Pedro called after me, “Don’t I need to pay you?”

I was so focused on getting out of this house I had completely forgotten. I turned to look at Pedro and saw behind him in the kitchen all of the gas burners on the stove were ignited and the cabinets all hung open. I couldn’t wait to get out of here.

“Just hit me on PayPal,” I said, turning again to leave.

“Wait,” Pedro called again, “Do you offer Apprenticeships?”

I stared at the man, dumbfounded. Apprenticeships? What am I, a welder?

“No” I answered

“Wait,” Pedro asked yet another time, “This was really cool and I’d like to be a part of it, what about internships?”

“Jesus Christ, man,” I was on the verge of breaking, I was physically repulsed by this house, my hand trembled on the doorknob, “Sure, you’re hired, just call me next week, you have my number.” Anything to make this guy stop asking me questions.

I pulled open the door and headed to my car. The last thing I heard from the tv before I closed it behind me was, “I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you”

That’s how I came into possession of the leg and my intern, Pedro, but things only got weirder from there.
