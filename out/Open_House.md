From the moment we walked in I had the feeling it was a bad idea. As soon as I crossed the front door to the hall, I felt a horrible anguish and an inexplicable urge to cry that I discreetly concealed by making a pompous comment about the origin of the entranceways. I stopped when I felt the lump in my throat tighten, the sensation was suffocating, but I couldn't say anything. After so many endless discussions, and having seen twenty-five houses in a single month, this one had to be perfect. Once inside, the house proved what the street it was located on had predicted minutes before. It was, without a doubt, perfect.

Gloria and I had decided to buy a house several months ago. The money was there, the desire was there, and her seven months of pregnancy threw us out of the two-bedroom apartment in which we had lived for years. Frankly, we were both fed up with the memorized speeches of real estate agents, but it was always me who suggested: "Why don't we keep watching?". In her last visits, Gloria could no longer even disguise her anger at my new dissatisfaction, which led to glacial arguments on the trip back to the soon-to-be-inappropriate two-bedrooms.

We went past the entranceway and the house displayed all its beauty. The pegged hardwood, the marble hearth, the patio mosaics, the Virginia creeper on the patio walls. It was dreamy. The house, the area, the price, the street. Gloria didn't come out of her astonishment, but neither did I out of my anguish. The discomfort was already so evident that Gloria, reluctantly, asked me what was the matter. I replied that I had a little bit of a headache, but that the house was divine. Gloria smiled and we continued forward to the living room. The agony that I was feeling became more and more acute. So I decided to leave the living room and when I entered the bedroom and without being able to contain it, I started to cry. Heartbrokenly.

Through tears and snot, I was struck by a black and white painting hanging above the bed. It depicted a lady, American shot, sitting in a chair with who seemed to be her son next to her. It was one of those photos where the eyes follow you no matter where you are standing. When I saw her an awful shiver went down my back and my hands began to sweat. I yelled Gloria’s name, but she didn't come, nor did she answer. I went back to the living room and she was no longer there. I crossed the patio to look for her in the kitchen, and when I opened the sliding door I found her filling a pot with water in the sink. As soon as I started talking, she interrupted me and told me to go wash my hands. I wiped my eyes with the sleeves of my sweater and shook my head in confusion. With my eyes no longer glassy, ​​I approached her. The cold returned to my back when I saw that her hair was white and straw-like, and that she no longer wore the clothes she was wearing before. She turned off the tap, turned around, and gritting her teeth she yelled at me to go wash my hands because we were about to have dinner. Shaken up and unable to utter a word, I began to walk backwards. She was looking at me angrily and her face was losing patience. She set the pot on the counter, pulled a brown leather belt from her kitchen apron, and began to walk slowly toward me. I could have pounced on her, I could have run away, I could have asked her who she was. But I looked down and when I extended my hands, they looked like a five-year-old's. I ran out to the patio and felt the belt hit my legs. I tripped and I fell, and I hit my head against a concrete flowerpot.

When I opened my eyes I saw Gloria on top of me trying to wake me up - I was lying on the bedroom floor. Having already realized that I had passed out, I got up, and the anguish was gone. Gloria went to get me a glass of water from the kitchen, and I went over to the painting, which kept looking at me. On a closer look, I could read a small inscription on the frame. “Gloria and Luke; 1932 ". The funny thing was not that the lady's name was Gloria, like *my* Gloria; we always laughed at the fact that she had an ”old woman's name”. The funny thing was that Luke was the name we had chosen for the baby.
