If anyone is reading this, send help immediately! Please, this is not a joke! The address is *************.

EDIT: I’m surprised that went through! All my calls and texts have been failing. Please send help as soon as possible! I’m trapped. I know it sounds crazy, but the house I entered is not the house I’m in.

EDIT: It’s all white. Everything is white. The floors are white. The walls are white. The ceilings are white. The decor is white. The furniture is white. It’s all white! Not a normal white, either. A sterile, pristine, pure white. Everything feels normal to the touch, but the coloring is unnatural. There was a potted plant by the window in the kitchen. I could smell its flowers and feel the grit of the dirt between my fingers. I spread the soil out on the table, hoping to get even the tiniest glimpse of color, but it was white throughout.

I found this place through an online listing. The pictures looked perfectly normal. The home was small, if not a bit dated, but it was affordable. I remember the “open house” sign in the yard and being greeted by the realtor on the front porch. We shook hands and talked for a moment. He was surprisingly personable, not at all like your stereotypical realtor. He invited me inside, and once I crossed the threshold, I ended up here. This is not the house I saw from the outside looking in.

EDIT: I’ve been stuck here for hours. I’ve torn the house apart trying to find ways to get the attention of people outside, but I’ve had no luck.

I can see out the front window, and everything outside looks normal. I can see the yard, the neighboring houses, and my car parked on the street. I see other home buyers coming to visit. I see the realtor inviting them in, then I see them leaving shortly after. When I go to the front door to meet them, it never opens and no one comes through. As they get closer, I bang on the window and scream until my voice breaks, but they can’t see or hear me. Has the realtor forgotten about me? If he remembered, surely he would have called for help.

I tried to break the window with a chair, but it didn’t even leave a scratch. My shoulder is numb from trying to bust down the door. I don’t think anyone can see the flashlight on my phone from the outside. If you’re reading this, please send help.

EDIT: That son of a bitch! He left in my car! I hadn’t even noticed the keys were missing from my pocket. The realtor knew the whole time! He got in my car, taking his time to adjust the rearview. Right before pulling away, he looked me dead in the eye and smirked.

EDIT: I want to give my sincerest gratitude to whoever sent help. Unfortunately, gratitude is all I can give. The police arrived shortly after dark. One walked up to the front door while the other looked around the outside of the house with a flashlight. He put his face up against the window and peered through with his light. We were face to face! I screamed and hit the window as hard as I could. Nothing. It's as if I wasn't there.

I don’t know what to do. I’m getting a headache looking at all the white. The air is stagnant and humid. Worst of all, it’s unnaturally quiet. If I hold my breath, I can hear my own heartbeat.

I’m exhausted.

EDIT: My instincts are telling me I must stay awake. I won’t allow myself to fall asleep. The atmosphere is stifling, the air oppressive. It’s getting more difficult to breathe. The silence is unbearable!

To help myself stay awake, I washed my face in the sink. The water came out solid white. I’m thirsty, but I don’t dare drink it. Looking at myself in the mirror, it was difficult to distinguish myself from my surroundings, to see the finer details and familiar features of my own face. Everything starts to blend together here.

I must stay awake. I won’t allow myself to fall asleep.

EDIT: I saw myself leave. I saw myself walk out the front door.

The realtor returned earlier this morning. He put his sign up, and I watched from the window as more people came and went. I tried my best to get their attention. After countless failures, all I could do was watch.

At some point, someone stepped out the front door who had never stepped in. I could only see him from behind, but I’d recognize him anywhere. It was me. I looked down at myself, then back up. He was even wearing the same clothes. His mannerisms are unmistakably mine.

He stopped on the edge of the porch and stretched. He slowly turned his head toward me, his eyes locking directly with mine, then turned back. The realtor walked up to shake his hand. They talked for a while, both looking at me a couple times throughout. I couldn’t hear what they were saying, but they were in good spirits and laughing.

The realtor took my keys out of his pocket and handed them to him. He turned toward me one last time and gave a genuine smile, then got in my car and drove away. The realtor calmly collected his sign, walked up to the window, made a gesture as if to tip a hat, and then walked away. That was the last I saw of him.

I’ve been sitting on the floor ever since. I saw myself leave.

EDIT: I look in the mirror and I see myself, but it’s not me. Those white, hollow eyes peering back. It’s all white. Always white. I sit and watch as the world passes by, but I won’t allow myself to fall asleep. Once again, I am grateful you sent help.
