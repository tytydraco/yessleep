I don’t even remember downloading the app.

It was just *there* one day, nestled between my weather widget and Spotify.  
Black icon. No name. Just a pulsing, red dot in the middle.

At first, I thought it was one of those random bloatware things Samsung sneaks in during updates, but I tapped it anyway. I expected an error or a store redirect, but it just… opened.

The screen was black, then text appeared, one word at a time:

**"VIEW A MEMORY."**

No settings. No info. Just a single red button below the text that said "Begin."

I should’ve deleted it. But I didn’t.  
Curiosity's a bitch.

**Memory #1:**

The moment I hit *Begin*, the screen went white—and then I *wasn’t* in my apartment anymore.

I was walking through a playground I’d never seen before. My hand—*someone else’s hand*—was clutching a cigarette. I could feel the burn between my fingers. Kids were laughing in the distance, but the moment I looked at them, their faces blurred, like VHS distortion.

Then I heard a voice behind me say, "You shouldn’t be here, Dad."

I turned around, and the screen *cut to black*.

When I came back to myself, I was on my bed. Two hours had passed.

I told myself I fell asleep watching YouTube or something. Maybe it was a dream. But the cigarette burn between my fingers was real—and my apartment still smelled like ash.

**Memory #2:**

A week later, I checked the app again. New message:

**"Would you like to see another?"**

Same red button. “Begin.”

This time, I was underwater.

I could *feel* it—the pressure in my ears, the burn in my chest. My hands—again, not mine—were bound. There was *something* blurry above me, a silhouette leaning over the edge of the boat.

I thrashed. Gurgled. Panicked.

Right before everything went black, I heard a voice underwater whisper:

“You shouldn’t have remembered.”

I woke up in my bathtub. Shivering. Soaked.  
Still wearing my jeans and hoodie. My nose was bleeding.

I uninstalled the app.

Or, I tried.

It wouldn’t go away.

**Memory #3:**

The app started *forcing itself open*. Middle of work. While driving. While I was in the shower. No red button this time. Just the words:

**"YOU’VE BEEN HERE BEFORE."**

One night, I threw my phone out the window. Bought a new one the next day. Didn’t transfer a thing. Fresh number. New everything.

It was back by that evening.

Same black icon.

Same pulsing red dot.

**Then it showed me a memory I** ***recognized***\*\*.\*\*

It was me. *Actually* me.

Nine years old. At the lakehouse. My cousin and I skipping stones.

Except… I wasn’t holding the phone. I wasn’t the observer.

I was the one *being watched*.

The perspective was from the *woods behind us*.  
Hiding. Breathing heavily.

And when I turned and looked directly into the camera, the video *paused*.  
New text appeared:

**"You don’t remember what happened next. But we do."**

After that, the dreams started. No, not dreams—*replays*. Memories that didn’t belong to me. Deaths I never lived. People I never met. I’d wake up gasping, bruised, bleeding, screaming words in other languages.

Sometimes I’d be staring at the wall for hours and swear it was *watching me back*.

One day I looked out my apartment window—and saw the *lakehouse*.  
Except… it burned down fifteen years ago.

I blinked and it was gone.

**Then the app changed.**

It didn’t ask if I wanted to “View a Memory.”

It said:

**"Now it’s your turn."**

**"Live one."**

**This morning, I woke up in someone else’s bed.**

There was a baby crying in the next room. A man I’d never seen was sleeping next to me. The name *Becca* was written on the mirror in lipstick.

My phone was in my hand.

Same icon. Pulsing.

**"Don’t break the memory."**

**"If you die in it, you die for real."**

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. The app won’t close. I can’t wake up. Every time I sleep, I just *load deeper*. Every interaction, every choice—it’s like I’m *settling into a life that’s not mine*. The baby knows me now. The man kisses me goodbye every morning.

And I’ve started forgetting my real name.

If you see the app, **don’t open it**.

Don’t be curious. Don’t be brave.

It’s not just showing memories.

It’s *feeding on them*.

It’s overwriting them.

And when it finally runs out of strangers to mimic—it’ll come for yours.

**\[EDIT:\]**  
The baby just said my name.  
The *wrong* one.
