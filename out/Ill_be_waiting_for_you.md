**After a brief conversation with the doctor about his new assistant, who also happened to be his daughter, I officially began my session.**

“*How about we just start from the beginning Antonio. Talk to me about where it all started*.”  Said the doctor.

“*That’s going to be a long story doc, are you sure you just can’t prescribe me like a pill or something*?”

“*The time in this session is all about you, don’t worry about that.  I want to hear everything you can remember about when it started and leading up to now*.”  The doctor repeated.

**I lied back on the couch and began to collect my thoughts**.

I was always close to my mom and dad. I am an only child unfortunately. When I was 6, they began taking me to the hospital frequently.  I had many examinations and blood samples taken that year. They never actually told me why, but I remember my mother crying hard every time she spoke with the doctors. My father had to hold her to calm her down.

My mother was a staunch catholic, and immensely proud of her Mexican heritage.  She kept a small alter to the Virgin of Guadalupe in her bedroom and prayed to it daily.  That same year I noticed she added a second shrine next to it.  I didn’t recognize who the statue was on the alter but it had a long black robe with a hood, a scythe in one hand and a globe in the other.  On it’s left shoulder sat an owl.  A floral crown of red flowers wrapped around its head, like what you would see a bride wear in a wedding. It was seeing the face on that statue that scared me at 6 years old, it was just a skull.

The figure looked like the grim reaper, and my child’s imagination ran wild seeing it the first time. The alter was decorated with flowers and candles of purple and white.  When my father saw me staring at it that first time, he quickly rushed over to me and shut the door.

“*Your mother has her beliefs little guy, best to just leave her to it*.”  My father told me.

On my 7th birthday, I remember my father answering the phone looking surprised by what he heard.  He hung up the phone and called my mother over as he picked me up and hugged me tight, kissing me on the forehead.

“*Who was on the phone dad*?” I asked trying to breathe through the dad hugs.

“*That was the hospital my little guy, and I promise we won’t have to go back there as much as you’ve been*.”

I cheered at the thought of not having to spend a child’s play time waiting in cold boring hospital rooms.  My father carried me into the bedroom to tell mom the news, she was kneeling in prayer to the dark robed statue that I was still convinced to be the grim reaper.  That’s when I heard my mother say its name before she stood up to hug me.

“*Thank you, Santa Muerte*.”  I heard her say.

**I lost my train of thought at this point** and looked up at Doctor Gabriel White sitting in front of me.  He stopped writing in his notes and looked up at me.  He wore a black 3-piece suit with his blonde hair slicked back, I couldn’t figure out why he would wear his circle framed sunglasses in doors though.

“*Listen, Doctor, it gets weird from here on.  I can’t remember everything in full detail, I was only a child and I’ve tried hard to block most of this from my mind*.”  I said to him.

“*That’s ok, you’re doing just fine.  I know it can be tough pulling these memories back up, it can almost feel like your re-living them.  Take your time and focus on what you think are the most important instances*.”  He said.

“*Why are you wearing sunglasses indoors at night Doc*?”  I asked him.

“*Oh, I actually had laser eye surgery recently.  My eyes are still a little sensitive to any light right now, I hope that doesn’t bother you*.”  He said abruptly.

I told the doctor it wouldn’t be an issue.

**I laid back again on the couch and continued to re-collect the memories**.

I was 9 when the weird shit started happening.  I remember sitting in the pew in between my parents at church, at least 200 people in attendance at your usual Sunday morning sermon.  I only looked down for a second, when I looked up the entire row in front of me was suddenly standing up staring at me.  They still had the clothes I remembered them wearing before, but their faces were just skeletons staring at me, cold and eyeless.

I looked around as the fear took over, I saw every row stand and turn to stare at me in an orderly fashion, all clothed skeletons, just staring with their jaws open and pointing at me.  I saw a woman stand up from one of the rows, she was wearing a long black dress adorned with different color flowers, black gloves covering her hands and a wide brim tilted hat with a veil that covered her entire face.  She seemed to almost drift over to the end of the pew where I sat and stood there motionless.

I began to sob as tears streamed down my face.  Before I could reach for my mother’s hand, I felt my father’s hands cover my eyes.  He whispered in my ear to stay quiet and that he was going to grab my hand and guide me out.

“*Don’t open your eyes, I see them too.  Just keep your eyes shut until I tell you to open*.”  My father whispered to me.

He grabbed my hand and guided me; I kept my eyes shut as I squeezed his hand.  I heard mother speak to the figure as I clung to my father with my eyes closed.  I never heard any response back, only my mother speaking.  I can’t remember anything she honestly said to it at this point, I just remember being so scared I was trying to picture happy things in my head to keep from losing it.

It was only when I was in the car that my father told me I could open my eyes.  Both my parents were silent on the car ride home from church.  They assured me everything was ok when I got home and said I was just a “special child” with gifts.  Still traumatized, I stayed hugging my mother the rest of that day.  In between drifting in and out of sleep, I heard my parents arguing but I can’t remember the depth of the conversation at this point in my life anymore, it was so long ago.

That next day was the worst day of my life before recent events.  Our house was outside of town, nothing but forest and trees on either side of the road leading up to it.  There was not a house for miles close to the one I grew up in.

It was a bright sunny day when I got out of school for the day, the school bus pulled up to my drop off point.  It reached the stop earlier than usual, otherwise my mom would have been there waiting for me.  As I got up and reached the front of the bus to get off, I looked back at all the children I would have normally seen with rosy colored cheeks sitting in the seats.

What I saw when I looked back was far different, they all looked like they were pale and gray.  Their skin looked shrunken in to their heads making the outlines of their skulls vivid.  Their mouths were all open like they were trying to speak, but only silence filled the bus as they all stood up on the seats pointing at me.  None of them had eyes either, they all looked like a horrid real-life version of that Edvard Munch painting called “*The Scream*”.

I screamed in horror as I ran down the stairs of the bus and fell on ground below.  As I picked myself up, I saw the bus driver pointing at me through the open door, he still had the same uniform on I remembered, but everything else was just a skeleton.  He was pointing at me aggressively, like he wanted to scold me for doing something wrong.  I ran crying away from the bus towards my house just wanting to get away.

I turned around once I heard the engine of the bus pick up and watched it drive off.  I stood in fright with tears still streaming down my eyes, I was only the equivalent of a city block away from my house but movement in the trees across the road distracted me.  That’s when I saw him the first time, I just called him the fat man.

He must have been about close to 400 pounds, tall in overalls with no shirt.  He was just swaying left to right next a tree.  After staring at him under the hot sun for what felt like forever, he came out of the shade and walked up to the opposite side of the road.  He just stood there swaying left to right.  He had no shoes and no hair, no pupils either, just white in his eyes.  Under his eyes were long black streaks that went to his mouth, almost like tattoos.  The fat on him hung in rolls, but the way he walked up to that sidewalk and swayed left to right made him seem light footed.

He motioned like he threw something on the road, then began to mimic playing hopscotch.  He jumped on both legs the first time, then hopped on 1 foot the next.  He repeated that motion all while getting closer to me.  The closer he got, I saw markings on his arms, not tattoos, these looked like they were carved.  Symbols and numerals I didn’t understand as a child.  When he got halfway through the road, he jumped on all fours and smiled.  His teeth looked like they were filed down to just points, razor sharp.

He moved his mouth like he was talking but no sound came out.  After a minute of this, I started hearing him in my head, like he was whispering into the wind that carried it over to me.  His voice hissed like a snake, telling me all the things he wanted to do to me…horrible cruel things.  I ran as fast as I could to my house, when I looked back, I saw he wasn’t chasing me.  He just stood up and casually followed my path all while keeping a nasty grin.

I ran through the front door of my house; my mother met me at the door as I blasted myself into her arms crying and wailing.  I screamed for her to make it go away.  She asked me what was there and what I saw but before I could say anything, she shushed me and told me she saw it.  I turned around and could see the fat man casually walking up our driveway, the front door wide open if he wanted to just stroll right in.

My mother sat me down and told me to close my eyes, I begged her not to let me go, but she looked at me and said…

“*Antonio, I promise you I will never let anything hurt you.  Do you trust me, my sun, moon and stars*?” She said so gentle.

I told her I did as I closed my eyes.  I heard her go out the door and close it and the yelling haunts me to this day.  I heard my mother yelling something, I don’t know maybe an incantation or prayer or something.  The thing though, that fat man, roared like some animal I never heard before.  It went on until I heard one last whisper in my head from that thing, his hissing voice filled my head saying once phrase that just fucking haunts me to hear to this day.

“*I’ll be waiting for you*.”  It hissed in my head from all directions.

I lost my train of thought at this point and tried to stand up looking at the doctor taking his notes.  I started hyperventilating in a frenzy thinking about the fat man.  I fell to the floor feeling lightheaded all of a sudden, I couldn’t fight back the tears and sense of dread that was inevitable talking about these memories.  The doctor quickly rushed over to me and put his hand on my shoulder kneeling down to the floor with me.

“*Antonio, I need you to breathe nice and easy.  Breathe in and breathe out, can you do that for me*?”  The doc said.

I still struggled to control my breath as I grabbed the doctor’s arms, letting my fear hit his ears.

“*Doc, you don’t fucking understand.  I see him everywhere now, ever since my mom passed away.  He’s at my work, he’s outside every window I see.  I have a wife and kids now, the other day I went to take my little girls to the playground and HE WAS FUCKING THERE!  When I went to go grab something from my car, he was FUCKING THERE PUSHING MY KIDS ON THE SWINGSET!  He tells me all the violent things he wants to do to me WHILE MAKING MY KIDS WATCH!!!*”    I said in between gasps trying to regain control of my breath.

The doctor kept his patience with me and calmed me down, telling me to start first controlling my breathing.  I finally regained control and he helped me back to the couch.

“*I’m sorry doc, It’s taken a lot of medication and a lot of alcohol to block these memories from haunting me*.”  I said.

“*Would you consider yourself an alcoholic*?”  The doctor asked.

“*Borderline, I did start drinking more as I got old enough to*.”

“*Do you think the drinking escalated some of these things you are seeing*?” The doctor asked.

“*I don’t honestly know; I can tell you I have had at least a drink everyday since I was 25*.”  I confessed.

“*Ok, Is there anything else you feel you need to add about your childhood before we move on to what has happened recently*?”  The doctor asked while writing in his notes.

**I laid back and thought about the one last thing I hadn’t talked about, even to my wife**.

Yea, that day I met the fat man.  When my father came home that day, my mother pulled him into a room by themselves.  I heard my father telling my mother “*I understand some things are unexplainable, but this shit is ridiculous.  I refuse to believe a level of bullshit this big*!”  He yelled at her.

That night, while I was in bed, A knock came at the door at around 3am.  It was so loud it woke me from my sleep.  My mother somehow rushed to the door before my father could.  I stood in the doorway to my bedroom watching my mother run down the hallway to the aggressive knocking at the front door.  She turned the corner and I couldn’t see her anymore, I could only hear her open the door and gasp.

“*You may not enter; these grounds are protected*.”  I heard her say.  Shortly after she spoke, I saw my father rush from the bedroom down the hallway, disappearing out of my sight to the front door.  Only my mother spoke briefly, my father never uttered a word.  I watched him as he came down the dark hallway, a small safety nightlight plugged into a socket illuminated his face as he stopped to look at me briefly.

Normally he would have said good night or “*let’s get to bed little guy*”.  That night, he saw something out there that changed him when he went to the door.  His face looked pale, scared, almost empty of any emotion, I had never seen him like that. He looked at me, but it’s like he was reluctant to see me.  He walked right past me and closed the door to the bedroom.

I remember the sound of the gunshot that night, it was brief and loud. It scares me still how quick death works sometimes, just one flash can end someone’s lifelong journey that seemed filled with purpose and promise.  My mother was hysterical, crying and holding my father when the police arrived. He had shot himself before she shut the front door.  Hearing my mother slam the door broke that silence for me finally.

After that night, things were seemingly normal until I hit 25 and developed a “slight” drinking problem.  I started seeing them again.  It was never too bad usually, just quick glances of them around the corner of my eye at work or at a bar, I got so use to it didn’t bother me, a quick glance of them all just staring and pointing like I was some outcast or unwanted thing.  At church, they usually stayed in sight the longest, so I just stopped going.  I can’t say I honestly ever really believed in anything anyway, I just think I’m crazy.

It was when my Mom died a month ago, that’s why I sought you out doc.  It’s gotten so bad since my Mom died.  I know I called you like crazy for the past 3 weeks, I just heard you were very good with this kind of thing, helping people like me who are probably delusional.  I mean, it has to be just manifestation from trauma or something right?

“*You mentioned on the phone something happened during your mother’s funeral.  Would you care to share that with me*?”  Asked Dr. White.

“*I saw Santa Muerte at my mother’s wake.  She came when everyone left and I was by myself, staring at my lifeless beautiful mother in her open casket.  She glided down the church pews holding a bouquet of flowers.  She no longer wore a veil to hide the white of her skull wrapped with a floral headband of white and red roses.  She placed her bare skeletal hand on my mother’s head and put a white rose in her hands.  She then looked at me said.  “This is no place for you, seek help from the father.”  She then walked past me until she disappeared walking down aisle. I don’t know what’s funnier in my hallucinations, death personified as a lady telling me, an atheist, to ask God the Father for help, or just thinking that I am seeing death personified*.”

The doctor stopped writing in his notes and set his red notebook down. He got up and took out a bottle of whiskey from his drawer along with 2 glasses.  He poured both glasses and sat one in front of me. He sipped his glass casually before he spoke.

“*I cannot say I’ve seen a case like yours exactly, but I believe I can help.  You seem like a whiskey guy, have a drink, you’re shaking still*.”  Said the Doc.

“*Doc, I’ve been drinking too much.  I am afraid I will see it, that fat man if I drink anymore*.”  I said nervously looking at the glass.

“*Thats what we want Antonio.  I need to see you when you think it’s close to you.   This will help bring you back to reality. Don’t worry, it’s part of the process.  Just tell me what you see and hear, and I will show you that nothing is real*.”  Assured the doctor.

With my back to the closed door of the office, I took the glass and downed it, ungracefully but efficiently to achieve a nice relaxed buzzed state.  The doctor stared at me while casually sipping his glass.  The sound of a door breaking into splinters filled my ears and made my eyes widen in panic.  Footsteps accompanied the sounds of shattered splinters flying in all directions spraying the hallway blocked by the closed office door to my back, the only thing protecting me from a bone grinding death of a fat beast.

“*Antonio, would you prefer your arms ripped off first or your legs?  I’ll let you choose.*”  The hissing voice of the fatman crawled through my ears.

The footsteps stopped, and the doorknob to the door behind me began to jiggle.  First slow, then faster.  A voice yelled out as the door began to violently shake screaming “*Where’s your fucking mommy now to protect you, you little fucking prick!*”.  I began hyperventilating again as I saw pictures and vases shaking in the doctor’s office, a result of the violent onslaught trying to break the door down.  Doctor White casually looked at me seemingly unfazed by anything going on.

“*Doc Please!  I don’t want to do this anymore, please make it stop I can’t do this, he’s going to hurt me*!”  I yelled.

The doctor looked at me and then began smiling.

“*Do you know how I first met your mother, Antonio? Did she ever tell you about me*?”  The doctor said with a gentle smile.

I looked in horror unable to understand what was going on.

“*What the fuck are you talking about?  Do you not hear any of this shit going on*?!?!”  I screamed at the top of my lungs.

“*I met your mother after her 4th miscarriage.  I found her in that house you grew up in so long ago.  She always wanted a child, I thought to taunt her for worshipping the Holy Virgin, after all, when you want kids, why worship a Virgin of all things*?”  He laughed as his voice began to ring in my head drowning out all other noise to a mere whisper.

I realized I was never talking to a Gabriel White once he pulled off his glasses revealing his black eyes.  No pupils, just the blackest eyes that never blinked.  His eyes filled my mind with hopelessness and dread strangling my thoughts and commanding attention to his presence.

“*Oh God……Lucifer.*” I whispered while watching him wink his right soulless black eye.

“*She did not resist me; she knew only I could give her what God sought not to. She willingly shared her bed with me. All I asked in return was to let me take what was mine when the time came. Death sought to take you early, just like she did with all my other attempts with God’s precious little creations.  Death did not look at your existence as something natural. It struck you with sickness early on at 6, but your mother refused to allow this, she fell in love with you. She made a pledge to death, offering herself in eternal devotion if only she would spare you, just like I knew she would. Death resented you as an evil on the world, but she answered the prayers of a willing devoted follower, albeit reluctantly, as is her nature against the natural course of things. Your mother’s devotion was unmatched by anyone else, and I knew she was the perfect choice to keep you alive as you grew naturally*.”

The words of the fallen angel tickled my ears, warping perception to feel like they were spinning around my head. I felt sick at the thought of his confession, utterly hating myself and scared for whatever horrid future awaited me. I watched him as he crawled on the table between us, perching like some animal on its edge until he began to speak again, not worried so much anymore about the door behind about to break open with the horrid creature behind it.

“*It was me who came knocking on your door that night. I came for you at 9 years past, I have plans for you, but your mother’s pact with Death was strong, and Santa Muerte is powerful as death should be, I couldn’t get near you. Your mother knew it was only temporary, she couldn’t keep me from you forever. she knew when she died the devil will get his due. I gave her a choice that night, either I took my son, or I take her husband, that weak pathetic man I was disgusted to see around my son. She never faltered, and when her husband looked into my eyes, I only showed him the truth about you. He was too weak to live with the honor of having royalty in his presence, so he took his life and came home with me that night*.”

I looked at Lucifer in utter dread of the details unfolding. I heard the door break behind me and the bellowing of the fat thing or creature. I was so repulsed and lost upon this point that death seemed like a salvation from hearing anything else about myself, just an end to this horrid truth.

I heard the beast stop in his tracks behind me, suddenly changing his tone and saying, “*I didn’t know you would be here*.”

Lucifer kept his eyes on me and smiled before saying…..

“I’ve been waiting for you….my son.”

Lucifers black eyes then shifted from me to the creature behind me I couldn’t see but knew was that fat beast.  Lucifer’s mouth blared open with a sound so loud and violent that no human words can describe it.  It caused the beast behind me to whimper and cower, I heard the fat man’s hissing voice pleading for mercy to the devil.

Lucifer jumped from his perched state towards the thing behind me. I heard violent rips and tears and screams of agony along with demonic howls. I saw a fat fleshy arm hit the wall in front of me as I froze in shock, afraid to look at the carnage behind me. I could feel splatters of blood and chunky bits of flesh hitting the back of my head and dripping down the back of my head.

In an instant there was silence. Lucifer walked calmy and casually into my peripheral from behind me, his jacket to his suit now gone, and his white sleeves to his dress shirt covered in blood as well as his face. He pulled a handkerchief and wiped his face clean of blood before grabbing the whiskey bottle and refilling my glass, as well as his.

“*Unfortunately, some of your siblings were a bit jealous of my attention towards you. You are the only half-human still alive. That is…or was…your brother. Fortunately, you have over 1200 siblings which I am excited to introduce you too soon*.”

In a mix of hyperventilation, fear, trauma, and utter existential confusion I did what any normal person would do at that point, I passed out right on the spot. I awoke to the prettiest dark-skinned girl I had ever seen. I looked around and saw I had been laid on the couch, no signs of blood anywhere on me or anywhere in the room. I looked around scared of what seemed like a bad dream freaking out, but the girl’s gentle touch on my arm calmed me down instantly.

“*Hello Antonio, I’m Yaza, Dr. White’s assistant.  He had some other patients to attend but told me you had passed out in shock.  I am here to make sure you're comfortable and see you out when you’re ready.  Take your time please, no rush*.”  Yaza said smiling.

I told Yaza I was fine and just needed a minute to compose myself before I left. There was something in her voice that sounded almost identical to my mothers, it soothed me and calmed me down. As I stood up to get my jacket, I heard her whisper behind me “Welcome to the family” which brought my senses back to alert. When I turned around, I saw that I was alone in the office.  I saw a half empty bottle of whiskey still on the Doctors desk, I made sure I took a couple of swigs before I departed. I didn’t know if I just hallucinated everything, or maybe I am just turning into a brain dead drunk.

I spent the next two days away from my family in a hotel in the city, I just needed time to myself and hot bath. I planned on detoxing for 48 hours just to see if I could do it. I changed my mind on the sobriety decision when I read my news app in the bathtub.

.

The article read…

**The office of a recently deceased Doctor, Gabriel White, caught fire last night. Dr. White was found dead one month ago of apparent suicide in his high-rise condominium. His body was reported missing from the local morgue 3 weeks ago and has still not been found. Firefighters recovered the body of one person that was pronounced dead by paramedics. Insider sources believe the body has been identified as Yaza Black, a 29-year-old African American female who was pronounced dead after a car wreck four months ago. The driver of the car, in which Yaza’s body was found the first time, fled the scene, but is believed to be linked to a series of killings that terrorized the Southeast as well as East Cost. Insiders could not disclose the name of the driver at large or any theories as to why Yaza’s remains would have been at the scene. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined by the local Fire Marshal**.

I read the news article over and over at the bar in the hotel lobby not knowing what to believe was real anymore.  I got a taxi home that night, knowing well enough I shouldn’t be driving.  I looked forward to seeing my wife and kids after the hell I just went through in that office, but I couldn’t bring myself to go inside after the Taxi drove away.

I saw the silhouettes of my wife and kids, each in a different window of the house.  Each of them occupied their own window, staring at me, swaying side to side.  My phone is blowing up with texts from my wife all saying the same thing, “We’ve been waiting for you”.  Once I finish this post, I am not honestly sure if I’ll go in the house yet, maybe I’ll hop a taxi to the airport first and get away.  Maybe Ill just wait out here until I sober up, but Ill go in eventually.  After that, your guess is as good as mine.
