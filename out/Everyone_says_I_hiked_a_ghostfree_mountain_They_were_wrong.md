In Indonesia, many mountains are known for their horror stories. Hikers get lost mysteriously. Spirits call out at night. Some say Mount Mxxx whispers to the living. Mount Lxxx has offerings piled at the summit. And everyone’s heard of the haunted trails of Mount Sxxx. But the mountain I chose? Mount Pxxx. Everyone said it was the safest. The most beginner-friendly. Not too tall, no dangerous cliffs, no real history of tragedy, and more importantly, no ghost stories. It’s a favorite for people doing their first mountain hike. And the only rule people remind you of? Don’t litter to keep the environment clean. I didn’t. I followed every rule.

  


The day I hiked was perfect. The sky was clear, the air was thin and cold, but fresh. Other hikers passed by me, smiling.

 

 

"*Cuacanya bagus banget, ya? Langitnya bersih.*” |  “The weather’s perfect, isn’t it? Clear skies.”

 

 

I smiled and nodded in response.

 

 

I reached the summit just before sunrise, exhausted but satisfied. The world below was hidden beneath a sea of clouds, and the peaks that pierced through them caught the first golden light like ancient crowns. For a moment, it felt like standing in a dream. It was perfect. I took off my backpack and sat on a dry patch of grass, letting the cool breeze sting the sweat on my neck. My legs ached, but it felt good. I pulled out a thermos of lukewarm coffee and a soggy peanut butter sandwich, the kind that tastes like heaven when you’re above the clouds. Nearby, a group of friends took turns capturing slow-motion videos of themselves jumping, trying to get that perfect mid-air freeze with the clouds behind them. Not wanting to lose, I snapped a few photos of the sky, of my shoes against the edge, of the tent cluster below. One of them I even posted: “Made it to the top of Pxxx! Unreal view." The signal was weak, but it went through.

  


After a while, I laid back on a flat rock, watching the sky turn from gold to soft blue. I closed my eyes for maybe a minute, just enough to feel the sun warm my face. The wind rustled the grass gently. I could still hear laughter, thermos lids popping open, someone playing soft music from a speaker.

  


But then something changed. The warmth of the sun vanished. Goosebumps rose on my arms. The air turned sharp and cold, too cold for this hour, for this weather. I sat up, confused, rubbing my arms. The sky still looked pale and bright, but the warmth was gone. It didn’t make sense. I reached for my backpack to grab a scarf. That’s when I realized I was alone. No laughter. No footsteps. No distant music. Just silence, heavy and wrong. Then, I noticed the fog. Not rolling in from afar like a weather shift. It was just... there. All around me. One moment, everything was clear. The next, the summit was gone. The sky, the trails, the campers, all vanished into thick white. I stood still, confused. Called out. No answer. Then, in the whiteness, a narrow side path emerged, one I hadn't seen before. It sloped downward between crooked trees that didn’t belong on Pxxx. I don’t know why I stepped onto it. Maybe because standing still felt more terrifying.

  


I walked for what felt like an hour, though I couldn't see the sun anymore. The fog never lifted, just hovered, thick, wet, clinging to my skin. My clothes were damp, and each step felt heavier than the last. The ground shifted beneath me, sometimes soft with moss, sometimes crunching with unseen twigs. I kept hearing faint sounds, whispers, the rustle of cloth, maybe even footsteps, but every time I stopped, there was nothing. And then, I saw them. People. That’s what I hope they are. Dozens. Dressed in traditional clothes such as *kebaya*, *lurik*, and *iket kepala*, as if they had just walked out of a 19th-century Javanese painting. Their outlines wavered in the mist like watercolors not yet dry. Their faces looked real, tired, and surprised. One of them, a middle-aged woman with a worn shawl, stopped and whispered to another while pointing at me. Her lips moved slowly, deliberately, as if the words themselves were heavy. Others followed her gaze. Everyone stared. They didn’t seem hostile, just startled. Their eyes flicked from my shoes to my backpack to my face, as if trying to make sense of me. Then a man stepped forward. He looked older than the rest, his back bent, his face creased like a dried leaf. His eyes were sharp, still, and didn’t blink much. He spoke:

 

 

"*Sampéyan punika sinten? Nopo panjenengan saged mlebet mriki?*” | "Who are you? How did you enter here?”

 

 

I stammered. “*Maaf… saya tidak mengerti.*” | “Sorry… I don’t understand.”

 

 

They looked even more puzzled.

 

 

Another man, this one younger, gestured for me to follow. He stepped lightly and didn’t make a sound as he walked. He led me to a small wooden hut nearby and smiled. The hut was old, its walls patched with mismatched wood and its roof sagging under damp leaves. He spoke too quickly and too formally for me to understand, but he waved me inside and pointed to the floor. I didn’t want to stay outside. So I went in. The smell of jasmine floated faintly at first, sweet, familiar, almost comforting. Before I could fully settle, the man looked at me and spoke gently, almost whispering:

 

 

"Sampéyan ngaso mawon rumiyin, ben awaké waras." | "You should rest for now, so your body recovers."

 

 

I blinked, unsure what he meant. I didn’t understand most of it. He noticed my confusion, smiled softly, and then brought his hands together near his cheek, tilting his head, the gesture for sleep. I nodded hesitantly. Then he turned and walked out of the hut, closing the door behind him with a quiet thud. I laid down, trying to calm my breath. But I couldn’t sleep.

  


I didn't know for how long I closed my eyes, I then noticed the jasmine scent grow heavier… and heavier… until it pressed against my face like a wet cloth. Sweetness turned sour, then rancid. The air thickened, clinging to my throat. I could taste it now, something spoiled, metallic, crawling with decay. Then came the stench of rot. Not just dead meat, but meat that had been forgotten. I sat up, nauseous. My head spun. The walls seemed to pulse in the corners of my eyes. Something was wrong. Very wrong.

  


I stood. My instinct told me to run. I staggered toward the door, gagging on the air. And then he was there. Blocking the exit. No longer the young man who had guided me here. No longer human. His skin was dry and gray, flaking in patches like burnt paper. His eyes were sunken pits glowing blood-red, unblinking. From his mouth hung a swollen, blackened tongue that dragged against his chest like a wet rope. His lips had torn at the corners, splitting upward in an impossible grin. Inside, his teeth were jagged and yellow, each one a different size, each one meant to tear. He hissed, a sound like air escaping a cracked skull.

 

 

"*Panjenengan botên dipun undang. Panjenengan kedah dipun korbanaken.*” | "You are uninvited. You must be sacrificed.”

 

 

I didn’t think. I threw myself at him. He was colder than anything I’d ever touched, like stone soaked in ice water. His clawed hand scraped my side as I pushed through, the tips slicing skin. I fell into the mud outside, gasping, the fog swallowing me whole. But I didn’t stop. I ran. Out of the hut. Out of that place. Into the fog that felt safer than the thing behind me.

 

 

More of them chased me now. Their human faces were fading, skin melting into something pale and waxy. Their mouths stretched sideways, far past the edges of their cheeks, gaping with too many teeth. Eyes sunken deep, rimmed in black, some blinking sideways like lizards. Their arms grew longer with every step, fingers curling like claws, dragging against the ground. Bones cracked and popped as they moved, but they didn’t slow down. They hissed through broken teeth. Whispered words I couldn’t understand. Shrieked like animals being burned alive. They threw rocks. One scraped past my shoulder, another slammed into my back. One of them lunged and scratched my arm, tearing skin. Another got close and I felt its breath on my neck, hot and sour. It snapped at me, trying to bite. I screamed and grabbed the nearest branch, half-rotten, slick with moss. I swung wildly, hitting something soft, something that let out a scream that wasn’t human. I kept running. Bleeding. Slipping in the mud. I don’t know how long I ran. My legs gave out eventually. I collapsed in a clearing, lungs burning, heart pounding like it wanted to break free from my chest. And still, the fog was everywhere.

 

 

That’s when I saw him. An old man sitting beneath a twisted tree. Dressed in a black *beskap* and a *batik blangkon*. His face calm, dignified. His eyes... ancient. He watched me for a long time. Then he said:

 

 

"*Panjenengan ingkang kapisan mlebet mriki, mboten naté wonten sadèrèngipun. Amargi punika, kula lan para tiyang mriki sangat ajrih menawi panjenengan badhé ndhatengaken bebaya. Kula ajrih, para tiyang badhé nyobi damel piala dhateng panjenengan.*" | "You are the first to enter here, no one from your world has been here before. That is why the people and I here are very afraid that you will bring danger. I am afraid that the people will try to harm you.”

 

 

"*Maaf Pak, saya tidak mengerti.*" | “I am sorry, I don’t understand.” I replied.

 

 

He nodded, then switched to Bahasa Indonesia:

 

 

“*Kamu bukan dari dunia ini. Kamu yang pertama masuk ke sini. Aku tidak tahu kenapa.*” | "You are not from this world. You are the first to enter. I don't know why.”

 

 

“*Itulah sebabnya mereka marah padamu.*” | "That’s why they are angry at you.”

 

 

“*Dunia ini tidak pernah dikunjungi oleh manusia dari tempatmu. Tidak seharusnya bisa. Tapi sepertinya sekarang sudah terbuka.*” | "This realm was never visited by humans from your side. It shouldn't be possible. But seems like the door has opened.”

 

 

“*Sebaiknya kamu keluar… sebelum terlambat.*” | "You must leave... before it’s too late.”

 

 

I replied “*Bagaimana caranya?*” | “How?”

 

 

He didn’t answer right away. His gaze dropped to the fog-covered ground, as if searching for something buried beneath it. The tree behind him creaked, though there was no wind. For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t speak again. Then, quietly, he said:

  


“*Mungkin… satu-satunya cara untuk keluar… adalah membiarkan orang lain menggantikanmu.*” | "Maybe… the only way out… is to let someone else take your place.” His voice trembled, just slightly. He didn’t look at me when he said it. He seemed unsure. Not just uncertain, he was afraid of the answer himself.

 



“*Atau mungkin dengan pengorbanan... atau dengan menunggu kabut-nya menghilang.*” | “Or maybe through a sacrifice… or waiting for the fog to clear. ”

  


He looked at me then. For the first time, I saw a flicker of pity in his ancient eyes.

  


“*Belum pernah ada yang seperti ini. Saya tidak tahu pasti. Tapi mereka akan mencarimu. Dan mereka tidak akan berhenti.*” | “This has never happened before. I don’t know for sure. But they will come for you. And they won’t stop.”

 



He stood slowly, brushing invisible dust from his clothes. The fog around us shifted, almost pulling at him.

  


“*Aku akan mencoba menenangkan mereka… setidaknya untuk sementara.*” | “I will try to calm them… at least for a while.” His voice was low, heavy with doubt. Then he turned and walked away, his figure swallowed by the fog.

  


I contemplated his three options.

  


The first, trap someone else. The thought made my stomach twist. I didn’t want to do that. I couldn’t. But even if I did… how long would I have to wait? Days? Weeks? Would someone even come? Would they take the same wrong step I did? What if no one ever showed up? What if I waited forever, with the fog pressing in and those things getting closer? It wasn’t a plan. It was a gamble with no guarantee.

  


The second, sacrifice. But what did that even mean? Sacrifice what? My life? A piece of me? The "people" here? And to whom? To the forest? To the fog? To the twisted things that whisper when the wind dies? Too many questions. Too much I didn’t understand. And I was running out of time to figure it out.

  


The last, wait until the fog clears. It sounded almost laughable. Wait? In this place? With them crawling through the mist, stretching their limbs, licking the air for my scent? What if the fog never clears? What if this is it—forever?

  


None of the choices felt like escape. Each one was just a slower way to die.

  


Before I made up my mind, I noticed those creatures were closing in. I could see that it was no longer just fear in their eyes, it was pure hatred. A need to erase me.

  


I crawled into a hollow tree, my breath shallow, my body trembling. Thorns tore into my arms as I hid inside a bush, curling into the mud like an animal. I bit down on my own hand to stop from crying out. The cold wrapped around me like a second skin. They passed close, so close I could smell the rot on their breath. The air warped with their presence. Some dragged their limbs, others twitched like puppets pulled by unseen strings.

  


The old man stood in their path. His arms were raised in ritual stillness, unmoving, like a statue carved from the mountain itself. A barrier. A prayer. They bowed to him, reluctantly. But I saw it in their faces. In their clenched jaws. In the twitch of their stretched fingers. Even he couldn’t hold them back much longer. His strength was a thread, and it was fraying.

 

 

I curled deeper into the hollow tree, holding my breath as the sounds of their footsteps faded. My body ached, scraped and bleeding, my heart pounding so loudly I was sure it would give me away. And then through a narrow slit in the bark I saw her. A figure moving through the fog. Bright red. A girl in a windbreaker, maybe in her twenties. A real living human. Blinking in confusion as she stepped into the warped forest, eyes darting from tree to tree like she already knew something was wrong. She looked disoriented, but untouched. Unharmed. Still fresh to this place. She didn’t belong here. Just like I didn’t.

  


And in that moment, something inside me cracked. This was it. This was the moment. The one the old man suggested. I didn’t want to do it. I wanted to scream for her to run. But my mouth opened and the words that came out were a call. A wave. A lie dressed as hope.

  


She looked up, surprised. Cautious. But curious enough to follow. She stepped forward, and the moment her foot touched the path, the fog lifted. Just like that. As if it had never been there at all.

  


I was out. But she…She was in.

 

 

The forest was normal again. Birds chirped. The sun shone through the branches. I ran down the trail as fast as I could. Someone had to know. I had to tell them that a woman was missing. She needed help. She needed to be rescued. I didn’t stop running until I reached the mountain guard post, breathless and shaking.

 

 

“*Tolong, ada seorang wanita yang tersesat, dia memakai jaket warna merah, aku khawatir dia dalam bahaya*” | “Help, there’s a woman who lost, she wears a red windbreaker. I am afraid that she will be in danger.”

 

 

The guard tilted his head. “*Nggak ada pendaki yang belum turun. Wanita yang kamu bilang sudah turun sejam yang lalu. Nih, dia isi logbook-nya*” | “There’s no one else up there. The woman you mentioned came down an hour before you, look, she signed the logbook.” 

 



Then he narrowed his eyes. “*Bukannya kamu juga seharusnya sudah keluar kota?*” | “Weren’t you supposed to be out of town”

 

 

“*Hah? Tapi saya tidak …..*” | “What? But I didn’t ….” My voice trailed off as my hands began to shake. I pulled out my phone and called my cousin. He picked up right away.

 

 

“*Kamu ke mana, kok kata Nenek tiba-tiba hilang?*” | “Where did you go? Grandma said you suddenly disappeared!”

 

 

I replied shakily, “*Sejak kapan aku sama Nenek?*” | “Since when was I with Grandma?”

 

 

He chuckled, confused. “*Lah... dari seminggu yang lalu. Jangan bercanda, ah.*” | “Since a week ago. Don’t joke around.”

 

 

I froze. A week. To them, I never disappeared. Because something else took my place, and no one knew the difference. But now that I’m back… it is gone. Returned to the fog. Because the path has opened.
