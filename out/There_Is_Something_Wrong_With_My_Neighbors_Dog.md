My Name is Anna, and I just moved to a new neighborhood with my Shitz Shu Toby.  
We moved to a small quaint town in Oregon, with a population of around 5000 people. I'm going to leave out anymore detail In fear that someone Will go looking for the horrid things I bore witness to.  
   
When I first moved to the small Oregon suburb, I made it a priority to introduce myself to my new neighbors, mostly because I'm new to town and desperately need friends. I decided to start my neighbor meeting "escapade" with the house across the street.   
 The house was a older two story brick home, and absolutely stunning If you can ignore the 12 foot fence around back.  
Even with the obviously distracting fence, the home was infinitely more beautiful than mine, with its peeling siding, and rotting porch.   
  
"At least I have a doggy door for Toby." I said out loud while crossing the street, and stepping up onto my neighbors porch.   
I walked up to the old wooden door and knocked lightly. Almost immediately after, a small old, and dainty man opened the door.   
  
"what do you want?" He scorned quickly.  
  
"Oh hello." I said, letting my anxiety get the best of me.   
"My name is Anna, my dog and I just moved in across the street." I stated. Just as the words left my mouth, the mans face turned ghost white.  
  
"You have dogs?" the man said, as though he was taken aback by the situation.  
  
"Well, just the one. He's a sh-" Just as I was about to finish my sentence, the man interrupted.   
  
"Keep your dog away from my fence, I don't ever want to see it on my property!" The man shouted, as he was closing his door. Shaken by this interaction, I decided to cut my neighbor meeting quest short and went back home, to dwell on what had just occurred.   
"Could what he said have anything to do with his comically large fence? was he raising elephants, and didn't want them to step on my dog?"  
I Chuckled.   
just as I was thinking about starting my comedy career after making myself laugh, Toby ran out of his doggy door.  
I bolted towards the door after him, remembering what the neighbor whose name I didn't catch, had said to me.  
I slung the door open to find Toby just doing his business. I sighed a sigh of relief.   
"Even if something was behind that fence, I doubt Toby would care anyway." I muttered to my self. Just as I finished that thought, Toby promptly proved me wrong by growling at the fence. My whole body tensed up.  
But what horrified me even more what ever growled back. It growled as if it had just learned how by trying to mimic Toby.  
My mind quickly fabricated a story to ease itself.   
"Maybe the neighbor has a special needs dog or something, and doesn't want Toby to bully it." I thought naively. after calming down, I grabbed Toby and made my way back home. I walked in the door and was suddenly hit with a wave of nausea, this didn't yield too much concern, as nausea was a common symptom with my anxiety. However, this wave of anxiety was overwhelmingly intense.   
I dropped Toby on the floor, and stumbled over to my couch to lay down. Just as soon as my head hit the arm rest, I lost consciousness. After what had to have been hours, I awoke in a cold sweat. I sat up in a daze while reaching for my phone so I could check the time. A feeling of sorrow hit me when the clock read 3:00 A.M.   
"Great there goes my sleep schedule." I muttered. Just as the thought left my mind I heard barking outside, barking that sounded just like Toby.   
"Shit I forgot about the doggy door," I said while striding to the door. I slung the door open to the sight of Toby starting to dig under the fence. I started a full sprint to Toby, but missed him by a second as he slid under the fence. Not even Five seconds after Toby got under the fence, I heard what sounded like a dog chirp in pain.  
"Damn it Toby, I can't afford a vet bill because you want to pick on the neighbors dog." I started pulling out my phone to use the flash on the camera to see what's going on. It turned out being the worst mistake I've ever made.   
I saw the most gut-wrenching thing someone could lay eyes on.   
The creature was tall, skinny, and pale. It hosted large, soulless, black eyes. The longer I stared, the more dread that built inside me.  
The creatures jaw was unhinged, and it was swallowing Toby, like a snake eats its prey, which would have drove me insane If the creature staring right at me hadn't done it first. I stood up as quickly as I could dashing back to my house.  
Once I finally got into the door, I came to the decision to use what I think are my last hours alive writing this warning.   
Always respect someones wishes because one day You may come across something you regret.
