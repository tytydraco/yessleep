Daily Routine

  Consider this a good bye note I am typing this from the mini closet under my stairs He has came back my parents prepared me and taught me and told me how to keep him away but I can hear him pacing in-front of the closet toying with me as a cat does it’s prey I know it can hear every breath I take no matter how shallow I breathe but I guess I should give some back ground. 
  
I [f]20 have had the same morning routine for years now. Every morning I wake up at 9am say thank you brush my teeth wash my face place an offering on kitchen table which 9 times out of 10 is whatever I eat for breakfast I just make two plates then I close every door in the house and make sure every light is off besides the light I’m the dining room. So far this has kept it at bae but some how I messed up. The rules were so simple how could I forget how could I be so simple minded and forget.               Monday- 9am said thank you, brushed my teeth, washed my face placed an offering closed the doors and turned off the lights
Tuesday-9am said thank you, brushed my teeth, washed my face placed an offering closed the doors and turned off the lights
Wednesday-9am said thank you, brushed my teeth, washed my face placed an offering closed the doors and turned off the lights
Thursday-9am said thank you, brushed my teeth, washed my face placed an offering closed the doors and turned off the lights. Everything went wrong on Friday 

Friday- 11am Shìt I’m running late, my alarm never went off, i hop out of bed and run to the sink washing my face I opt for a piece of gum and run to the kitchen I grab a granola bar and through another one in the other room I turn off the lights then close the doors. I forgot my keys so I run into my bedroom and grab them and run to the car. Work goes by without a hitch it’s not until I get home I notice the granola bar unopened on the table that’s not normal. 
   
Then I hear it’s low growl I walk in the direction of the sound and notice my bedroom door is wide open and in the darkness I can make out the frame of what appears to be a long skinny man but I know it’s not just any many it’s him I know he’s here for me and I know he will never leave. I run away from the bed room and under the stairs into a little storage closet you know like the one form max and ruby. I can hear his heavy breathing along with his heavy steps as he gets closer I hear him stop in front of the closet and then silence there is nothing I can’t hear the breathing I can’t hear foot steps I can’t hear my own heart beat and I didn’t hear him behind me good bye.
