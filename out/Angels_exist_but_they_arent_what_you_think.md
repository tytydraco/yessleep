I work in an organisation that serves as both a research facility, and a jail of sorts. We officially call the things we detain “preternatural entities”, but realistically we just call them creatures. We just received a new creature that, ethically speaking, I can’t keep secret.



The organisation, which has no official name, has existed for a long time. We trace our roots all the way back to King Josiah, in the 7th century BCE. To placate the masses, biblical stories were made and altered, which is what scholars call a “religious reform”.



Since our founding, we’ve held that creatures known as “Malakhim” or “angels” do indeed exist, but have evaded capture. Until last month that is.



I was on an excursion in Iran with 4 other agents. We had received reports of “glowing men with magical powers” and the higher-ups decided it was valid enough to warrant exploration. I was the senior officer present, and so I led the team.



We came across a cave that can only be described as: weird. The mouth of the cave was angled, going into the ground. There was no rock or sediment keeping the sand up, almost like the tunnel had been deleted from space and the rest of the ground hadn’t caught up yet. Sophie, who has a master’s in geology, told me that there was no realistic way the mouth hadn’t collapsed in on itself.



Our teams are always composed of multiple “experts” in various fields. In a way that is, ironically, preternatural, our supervisors seemingly always know what experts to send on a mission.



“So… are we gonna go into the impossible cave?” asked Jacob, anxiously clipping his flashlight to his vest.



“It looks like you already know the answer!” Sophie laughed, gesturing to his light.



“Hey, you know me,” Jacob smirked with a shit-eating grin, “I always want permission before entering.”



“You’re not a vampire.” Sophie pushed him lightly.



“Oi! You two, get a fucking room!” Val groaned, rubbing her temples. I smiled softly at their idiocy and camaraderie. In hindsight it’s good they were happy for a time.



We slowly began our descent, cautiously entering the mouth of the cavern. Dust particles lit up by our torches, and the stench of mildew assaulting our senses.



“So, this gravity-defying cavern-” I began



“I prefer ‘impossible cave’, it sounds cooler!” Jacob cut me off with a roaring laugh.



“Fine,” I chuckled, “this impossible cave. What are we thinking, ontology threat? Or maybe material?”



“If I may…” Hans, our phenomenology expert, chirped, “I think it could be a Spatiophysical threat.”



“Well that’s just fuckin’ peachy” I groaned as we spelunked deeper. We travelled down for probably 30 minutes, in which time I had to break up Jacob and Sophie’s flirting at least 8 times, while the tunnel’s walls twisted in ways that made depth-perception nearly impossible. Then we reached a large cavern.



The first thing we all noticed was strange images and icons carved into marble walls.



“These are Babylonian.” Jacob said with a seriousness that was previously absent. It was here that I understood why we have an iconography expert.



“What do they mean?” I called out while surveying the long hall before us.



“Christ, Mark,” he sighed, “can’t you be impressed I recognised that immediately? Give me some time to actually decipher.” His voice trailed off to a grumble.



I shone my flashlight onto a pillar, and saw a writing system I couldn’t recognise. I called Val over, needing her expertise.



“Oh yeah, that’s cuneiform!” she perked up at the sight, “you don’t see this much!”



“Have fun, kiddo!” I laughed as I patted her on the back.



“I’m a year younger than you, dick!” I heard her call out, already pulling out her notebook and beginning to translate.



It was then I noticed the dust in the air. It was stationary, just frozen white specks illuminated by my flashlight. I waved my hand through a cluster, only for them to pass through me like I was a projection.



“Hans… come here a sec…” I called.



“What’s up, boss?” he eagerly appeared beside me before his eyes grew in excitement, “oh wow…”



“Yeah…” I gasped out.



While they were all working, I ventured deeper into the hall, seeing artwork and writing carved into almost every surface that I couldn’t walk on. The dust was still hanging stationary in the air before me, and it took me a moment to realise that the dust was now backlit, not just the light from my torch.



A crack in the wall ahead of me, with a bright white light shining through. I approached more recklessly than I like to admit, but something about the light made me feel so at ease. As I closed in on the light, I realised the crack was actually a gap for a door. 



Then in an instant, Jacob had me pinned to the ground, hands held behind my back. We were both breathing heavily like we had run a marathon. 



We were right in front of that door.



“What the fuck!?” I shouted, “get the fuck off me!”



“Wait! English! Get off him!” Hans’ voice rang out as I heard him wrestle Jacob off me. I felt the tension in my shoulders lighten immediately as he was removed from my back. I slowly stood up, an aching pain shooting up the left side of my neck.



“What happened?” I rubbed my head, looking around at everyone who had gathered.



“Are you fucking kidding?” Jacob’s voice seethed with rage. I looked over to him and my gut twisted into a knot.



Where his right eye was, had been replaced with a bloodied, swollen mess. Pus and plasma coated his face like he dunked his head in a yellow paint bucket. Val was rummaging through a medical kit, frantically scanning for patches and disinfectant.



“Jake…” I gasped out. He grunted as he turned and walked off. I felt a hand on my shoulder as Hans began to speak.



“You really don’t remember?” His voice was soft, almost cautious.



“I was walking to that door there, and then…” I inhaled deeply, trying to remember, “and then Jake had me on the ground.”



“Boss… we should get out of here…” his eyes shifted between me and the door.



It turns out, I had suddenly started speaking a language that none of us knew. According to Hans, it had a lot of uvular sounds, the phlegmy kind of sound in German or Hebrew or the likes. Then I drew my side arm and pointed it at my temple, raving like a madman in this language. It was then Jacob tackled me. We fought, and I apparently dug his eye out with my thumb. We scuffled like that for 10 minutes, the whole time I was speaking in tongues.



As we all were packing to report back to base, I turned to the others and mustered my best “commander voice”.



“You lot should head back. Whatever is behind that door needs to be catalogued.”



“Fine by me.” Jacob pulled his bag onto his back, staring at me through the blood-soaked bandage over his eye.



“No. You shouldn’t… not alone. You were going to fucking kill yourself!” Sophie protested.



“Look. I’ll run and open it. Last time, I lingered. I’ll use the field camera, and the lab back home can tell you what happened.” I began to go through my bag.



“Boss, I’ll stay with you, just in case.” Hans’ voice was solemn, with hesitancy hiding between his words. Curt nods were exchanged between all of us, followed by the other 3 beginning to walk off.



“Jake, wait!” I called out, “I’m sorry… I didn’t know… It wasn’t… me.”



“Yeah…” he grumbled, “but it was your fucking face.”



Hans and I turned and faced the door. We slowly made our way towards that soothing light.



“Vater unser im Himmel…” Hans muttered under his breath.



“I didn’t know you were religious, Hans… The Lord’s prayer?” I check my holster and make sure it’s locked as we walk. I’d never heard him pray before, and he’s said many times he tries to not speak German around us. He says he doesn’t want us to think he’s ‘gossiping’ even though Val and I both speak it.



“With all the stuff we’ve seen, you think there’s nothing out there?” he chuckled, shifting slightly as he walked.



“I guess… but what kind of fucked up God would create all that shit?” I chuckled back. Neither of us found it funny. Hearing him revert to something so primal, so instinctual, all I could do was laugh.



As we got closer to the door, the air became colder. The type of cold that seeps into your bones and freezes your marrow. I noticed Hans slowing down, and then I noticed he was slowing to match my pace. My feet were dragging, like the cells of my body didn’t want to approach the door again.



“Boss. I’ll do it…” he stared at the door, waving at me to slow down.



“What? No!” I ordered.



“Just shut up!” he cried. Before then, I had never heard him shout. It sounded wrong, like the cave warped his words.



“Hans…” I pleaded.



“No, I’m not sorry. You’ve got a fucking wife and kids, all I have is a boy back home that’s probably fucking someone else. If this goes sideways, I’m the one that’s least likely to be missed!” the rage in his voice churned like a stormy sea, threatening to destroy everything in its wake. Then I realised that he had made waves. The dust around him danced as it fell. Corrupted snowflakes waltzing towards the ground.



“Hans, what are you saying? Jürgen loves you dude… he got you that stupid… whatever it was… last Christmas!” the rambling fell out of my mouth. It was a pathetic attempt to stop him. The dust around him began to spiral faster, like the cave itself was reacting to our argument. Before I realised what was happening he began running to the door.



“Geheiligt werde dein Name.” he panted as he ran



“Hans, get back here, that’s an order!” I called out. I tried to run to catch up, but my feet refused to lift off the ground.



“Dein Reich komme. Dein Wille geschehe, wie im Himmel so auf Erden.” He reached the door and pushed it open.



The light flooded the cave before us, so bright that I felt it burning my retina and searing my optical nerve. It singed throughout my skull, as a drumming sound rattled the bones throughout my whole body. Not an external sound though, it was almost like my ribs were shaking against my lungs. The last thing I saw before my eyes shut from reflex was the shape of Hans, bursting into flames before I could even call out his name.



My eyes snapped shut and I felt the ground tremble under my feet. That drumming sound echoed through the chamber louder and louder. I heard screaming behind me. The screaming of Val, Sophie and Jacob.



Then, a groaning voice called out from in front of me. Where the door was, where Hans was.



“Al Tira.”



Hebrew. ‘Do not be afraid’. The calling card of angels.



The tremble beneath me grew exponentially. I felt rocks falling onto my head, locked in place, unable to move. I tried to force my eyes open, to see the creature before me, but the pain had welded my eyelids shut.



Then that same groaning voice spoke from within my gut, an ancient voice that defied language and accents.



“You will share this story. We are to be left alone. The day of our surfacing is yet to dawn.”



Then I was suddenly outside. I could feel the hot desert wind against my face. My body was still frozen. I managed to send a distress call back to base, and then everything faded to black.



When I woke up, I was in the infirmary. I looked around for a sign of anyone, but saw nothing. I tried to stand, but my legs didn’t listen to the signal. I kept searching, wondering why my sense of depth seemed to evade me. Then the door opened. Doctor Otto, one of the head researchers, approached cautiously.



“Mark!” His voice wavered as he spoke “I’m glad you’re back with us. We were worried for a moment.”



“What happened, Otto.” I had learned to identify his fake, corporate happiness.



“We were hoping you could tell us… We got your footage, including your fight with Hans, but when he opened the door, the video cut off. We aren’t sure if the file got corrupted somehow, or if your devices were fried.” He spoke with that equally false corporate empathy.



“My legs, Otto. My sight…” I growled at him.



“Okay… I had hoped to hold off on this for a while, but here we are, I guess.” He sat down on the chair next to my bed.



“You gonna tell me I’m dying or some shit? Spit it out!” I snapped at him.



“Fine.” He inhaled sharply, “Whatever happened to you, it impacted your nervous system. Your right optic nerve, and both your sciatic nerves were… erased…”



“The fuck you mean, erased?”



“MR Neurography and a brain MRI revealed nothing where they should be. I’m sorry Mark… we’ll do what we can, but it’s likely you’ll never walk again or regain sight in your right eye.” He patted me on the shoulder with that stupid fucking ‘empathetic look’, like the face you give an animal before it gets a shot.



I’m still in the infirmary, and I’ve been here for 4 days. The likelihood of me regaining those nerves is almost nonexistent. I still don’t see out of my right eye, and every time I try to flex my legs I feel the absence in my body. The others haven’t reported in, and their GPS trackers have gone dark. All I can think about is Hans’ sacrifice, and Jacob’s unforgiveness. I said I needed to share this because I felt ethically obligated, which isn’t a lie, per se. That thing told me to share, and something in me agrees with it. Some small part of me is screaming that I need to share, and that everyone needs to know.
