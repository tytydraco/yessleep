As I lay in bed, leafing through my old hardcover copy of *Talking To Heaven*, a tickle on my wrist. Some sort of beetle the size of an apple seed, flat and brown, crawled up my arm as if out for an evening stroll. I shrieked and blew it onto the nightstand.

I’m guessing it’s because I’ve lived in the city my whole life that I’ve never been a fan of bugs. Spiders hunched in dark corners. Bloated worms rotting on the sidewalk. Fruits flies buzzing around the sink in a cloud of filth. I know insects are a part of nature, but so are viruses—just because something’s natural doesn’t mean it’s good. 

I snatched a tissue from the box, draped it over the thing as it tried to scurry off the edge of the nightstand, and smashed it with the spine of my book. Wadding up the tissue, I flushed it down the toilet. And flushed again.

Back in bed, I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. But an Internet factoid kept creeping into my mind, how the average person supposedly swallows eight spiders a year in their sleep. Throat scratchy, I scurried to the bathroom for a glass of water and an Ambien, then burrowed under the covers and fell asleep.

The next morning, I awoke having all but forgotten about the encounter. I held a session across town, browsed the aisles at a used bookstore, and spent my usual quiet evening at home, this night with a filet of salmon, pint of mint chocolate chip, and a *Twilight Zone* marathon on the SyFy Channel.                                      

Three days later, while stripping my bed sheets, another of the disgusting bugs bumbled across my mattress like a cursor on a computer screen. Without thinking, I brushed it on the floor with the back of a hand and stomped, mashing it into the carpet with the heel of my slipper. I lifted my foot to make sure it was dead. Motionless, it stuck to my sole.

I took off the slipper and brought it over to the computer. Typed “indoor insects” into the search engine and sifted through a nightmare gallery of cockroaches, pill bugs, and centipedes before I had a match. A wave of nausea swept through me. It was a goddamn *bedbug*.

Weren’t bedbugs for messy people? But my apartment was spotless! Which meant they were coming from someplace else, probably that meathead down the hall, the stink of a locker room seeping out from under his door.

I did more research and learned the nasties had become increasingly common over the past few decades, for whatever reason. The only good news was that, although they could bite—sucking blood like mosquitoes and ticks—they weren’t disease carriers. Some consolation.

Though it was almost midnight, I called my landlord, demanded that he send an exterminator the next morning, and hung up before he could make any of his excuses. I yanked off the bedsheets and shoved the mattress on the floor but didn’t find any more of the bastards. A couple of Ambien later, I curled up on the living room couch under the afghan, and, scratching the occasional imaginary itch, watched *I Dream of Jeanie* reruns until I fell asleep.

A ring woke me late the next morning. It took a few confused seconds to figure out it was my doorbell—sadly, it’d been that long since I’d had a visitor. I jolted up from the couch and raced to the door, eye against the peephole. A man in a red and blue uniform stood there.

The exterminator told me I’d need to “vacate the premises” for the next six hours, which was perfect since I had a session, anyway. I got dressed and left, relieved to be escaping the infestation, if only for the day.

My client was a tiny, quivering Lithuanian widow whose sprawling Victorian smelled like onions. She wanted to speak with her husband, gone for almost twenty years. Her cold dry hand clutching mine, I tried to establish contact for nearly two hours but to no avail.

“The spirit world is elusive,” I told her with a shrug. “We can try again tomorrow.”

When I asked for my modest fee, she grunted up from her chair, shuffled to the closet, and came back gripping a broom. Jabbering in a foreign tongue, the awful woman literally swept me from her kitchen, down the hallway, and out the front door, which the ingrate slammed in my face.

Teeth clenched against my rage, I called a cab to take me to the pharmacy so I could refill my old Xanax prescription, which, thankfully, was still good. I popped one on the way out the door, and, calmer than I’d felt in days, strolled the sunny sidewalks for some window-shopping.

To distract my mind away from my vermin-filled home, I killed a couple of hours at a coffee shop, sipping a latte and browsing tabloids. A scruffy teenager played an acoustic guitar in the corner, fingers scrabbling over the strings like a Daddy-longlegs. It might’ve been the amplifier, but when he sang a second voice in the background, faint and trembling, wove in off-key harmonies.

Before long, six hours had passed, and it was time to go back to my apartment. But I didn’t want to. I dug my cell from my purse and called Arianne.

“Can you hold on a sec, hun?” Arianne said. I leaned against a lamppost, phone against my ear, listening to roaring laughter and what might’ve been a brass section. “Okay, I’m back.”

“So good to hear your voice,” I blurted, tearing up, happy to be speaking to the only person in the city I could honestly call a friend. “First—and you won’t believe this—I found a bedbug in my apartment. An actual bedbug! So, of course, I got the place fumigated.”

“Really,” Arianne said, barely audible over blaring trumpets.

“And then one of my clients wouldn’t even—”

“Don’t you dare!” Arianne screeched in my ear.

I held the phone away from my face. “What?”

“Not you, hun. Someone else,” Arianne said. “Know what, babe? This really isn’t a good time. I’m in New York. With Gil.” She whispered the last part.

I didn’t know who Gil was but figured he had to be Arianne’s latest paramour. “Sugar daddies,” she called them, which she explained wasn’t sex work because *she* chose *them*.

“I’m really having a hard time here,” I almost sobbed. “Could I maybe stay at your—”

Arianne sighed irritably. “I can barely hear you. How about you fill me in when I get back, okay? Love ya!” A smacking kiss, and she hung up.

I stood there with the phone in my hand beside the swarming traffic, berating myself for expecting anything—anything at all—from that selfish creature.

When I got back to the apartment, the exterminator was gone. The smell wasn’t bad, just a faint trace of something metallic. I opened the windows to let in the cool early autumn air, switched on the ceiling fan, and lit a few vanilla candles.

My heart crammed in my throat, I tiptoed into the bedroom as if sneaking up on an unfaithful lover. Holding my breath, I inspected the top of the mattress, flipped it over. Reluctantly, I knelt down to look under the bed. All clean. I let out a sigh.

Every day for the next week I scrutinized my bed, carpet, dresser drawers, and closets for signs of the invaders. Nothing. They were gone. I could relax again.

Four mornings later I woke to find one of the horribles squatting on my pillow, inches from my face, like a mint left behind by housekeeping. Gagging, I carried the pillow at arm’s length over to the balcony, sliding the torn screen door open with my foot. Then tossed the whole thing over the railing to watch it plummet seventeen stories to the street below. Suddenly exhausted, I crumpled into a ball on the cement. I cried a little.

The exterminator came back that afternoon. “Sorry,” he said with a sheepish smile. “Must’ve missed some eggs on the first sweep. Mind if I take a look?”

“That’s your job, isn’t it?” I snipped, not about to be taken advantage of again.

Sliding a flashlight from a hip holster, he went into the bedroom while I vacuumed the living room carpet for the second time that day.

After maybe ten minutes I noticed him standing there looking at me. I shut off the vacuum.

“I didn’t find anything,” he said, almost accusingly.

“Must not have looked very hard,” I shot back.

“Sure they were bedbugs?”

Annoyed now, I clenched the handle of the vacuum. “Positive.”

“There’s no sign of them.” He scowled, as if blaming me for his own subpar work.

“You think I’m making this up?”

He paused a bit too long before answering, which made me furious. “I don’t know, lady.” He shrugged. “If your landlord’s paying for it, I’ll bomb the place again.”

Satisfied, I nodded. “Make sure you get them all this time,” I spat, and fled the apartment to catch a film.    

The next week, I discovered two of the monsters on my headboard. The room swam for a moment before I got ahold of myself. Then I punched each of them dead with a bare fist, blood trickling from my split knuckle.

On my hands and knees I inspected the carpet. What if they were breeding under there? I crawled to the corner to see if I could pull up an edge. No, but there were a few tiny brown turds. For Christ’s sake, not only did I have bedbugs, mice were setting up shop, too!

I must’ve sounded like a madwoman when I called my slumlord, as he kept telling me to “settle down,” that he couldn’t understand what I was saying.

I calmed myself enough to insist he send over another exterminator right away or I’d “burn the place to the ground.” Needless to say, I took a double dose of Xanax.

By noon, a new exterminator in a brown jumpsuit showed up, and I checked in to a four star hotel. Despite my meager bank account, I needed to feel clean, if only for a night. You better believe I scoured every inch of that room to make sure it was pristine before I lay down on the ivory comforter.

I slept okay despite the occasional grunt, groan, or sigh from the bathroom—like someone relieving himself—startling me awake a few times. My phantom urinator aside, I was comfortable in the plush and immaculate room, and in no rush to head back home. I ended up staying for three nights, which cost almost a thousand bucks, part of a good month’s income. And it hadn’t been a good month.

Finally, nowhere left to hide, I trudged back to my apartment, dread scalding my insides as if I’d swallowed a pot of hot soup. I unlocked the door and sniffed the air, encouraged by the strong metallic stink. Chewing my lower lip, I marched straight into the bedroom.

I’m proud to say I didn’t make a peep when I found five of the sons of bitches cavorting on the nightstand. One at a time, I crushed them between my fingers and smeared their carcasses against the wall as a warning to the others.

Obviously, getting rid of the wretched beasts was beyond the ability of some rip off exterminator. Like everything else, it was going to be up to me. I dry swallowed another couple of Xanax.

Back on the Internet, I spent hours reading up on the crawling freaks, eventually clicking on a page with close-up photos of insects that looked like—but weren’t—bedbugs. A cousin of bedbugs, bat bugs lived in caves and fed on the blood of roosting bats.

I thought back to the poop I’d found in the corner. Could it have been from a bat instead of a mouse? Had one found its way into the apartment—through my torn screen door, maybe—bugs hitching a ride on its veiny wings?

I did some more research, learned how there were over a thousand species of the hideous flying rats, how they were supposed to be so great because they pollinated flowers and ate mosquitoes, and how millions of them were dying from some fungus that grew on their faces. Good riddance.

As the night grew late, I found myself on a website about vampire bats, the South American species that drank cow’s blood…along with the occasional sleeping human’s.

When I finally fell asleep, I dreamt of Casper, my childhood kitty, twining around my legs. Except when I bent down to pet him, a torrent of yellow maggots spilled out of his empty eye sockets and piled in a squirming mass around my ankles. I woke drenched in sweat, ran to the bathroom, stripped off my nightgown, and examined my entire body for bites. All clean, false alarm.

Curious what the dream meant, I logged onto [Occultopedia.com](http://Occultopedia.com), which explained how cats could be familiars for vampires. I laughed out loud. Still, for no other reason than to occupy my mind, I kept reading and learned that familiars didn’t have to be cats, they could be any sort of creature. Like insects, I wondered?

Yes, I’m a medium who was born with the ability to speak to the dead. That doesn’t mean I believed in vampires. I turned off the computer, checked my sheets and pillows—all clear, thank heavens—took two Xanax and two Ambien, and shut off the light.

I woke again in the middle of the night scratching my neck. Hit the light, flung off my nightgown mid-sprint to the bathroom to stare at my pale goose-bumped flesh in the mirror. Eyes blurry from sleep, it took me a few seconds to make sure it was real.

Lifting my chin to get a better look, I traced a finger over a pair of red spots on my jugular vein. The bites, two inches apart, almost looked like fang marks. Dizzy, I sat down hard on the closed toilet lid.

I’m not naïve, but years of communicating with the dead taught me to have an open mind. If there are lost souls among us yearning for contact, then are the undead really that much of a stretch? Clearly not, I finally accepted.

It was three in the morning, but I had to tell the world what I’d uncovered. I called Arianne, but of course it went to voice mail. I rushed over to the computer and, typing in a frenzy, dashed off emails to the local TV, newspaper, and radio outlets explaining my revelation.

How it’s not only bats that can be a vampire’s familiar but bat bugs, too. How the bats find their way inside a home, carrying the bugs, which siphon off the victim’s blood and crawl back to their master to feast.

After all, if you’re a hungry vampire, why go to the trouble of a restaurant when you can get home delivery, lying in bed (in coffin?) as you pop one blood-filled insect after another into your mouth like bonbons? I implored the journalists to do their jobs for once and report on what was happening, before it was too late.

I shut the computer and paced around my apartment, smacking the side of my head, trying to get the thoughts to flow. I had to accept that, even if the authorities got involved, it wouldn’t be in time to save me. As always, I was on my own. I scratched the bites on my neck until they bled.

Obviously, it was pointless to try to stop the bat from coming in. The bugs were already there, breeding under the carpet, behind the furniture, in the walls. Like unwanted houseguests, as long as I kept the refrigerator full—in this case, my veins—they weren’t going anywhere. I laughed at the idea of the vampire bugs as some deadbeat relatives mooching off my hospitality. And kept laughing, until the answer came to me.

My plan was simple but brilliant. I’d go out and buy a bottle of wine and drink a few glasses. Then I’d let the little shits suck down my alcohol-tainted blood and bring it back to their boss, who’d spit out his spoiled meal, call off his minions, and never trouble me again. If the tactic worked, I could share it with others, and maybe we could start to rid the city—the world?—of the bloodsuckers.

Sure enough, I found a couple of them on the nightstand the next day. Having them where I wanted, I just smiled. Defiantly, I polished off the rest of the wine along with a double dose of pills.   

There were a few more on the bedspread the next morning, but I refused to panic. I went out and bought some scotch, took slugs from the bottle until I passed out.

I woke up hours later and found a spot of blood on my nightgown just above my left breast. Still numb from the alcohol, I watched myself go through the motions of taking off my gown, running cold water over it from the bathroom sink, and dabbing the spot with a paper towel. Then fell to my knees with the futility of it all.

It had been stupid to think that the vampire would somehow be put off by my blood alcohol level. For all I knew, it was a treat for him, like a sweet after-dinner Riesling. There was no beating this, no happy ending. 

Nude and in a daze, I walked out to the balcony, nightgown in hand, and gazed down at the city, yellow streetlights strung out like a garland of fireflies. He was out there somewhere, laughing at me, knowing that I belonged to him—knowing that *I* knew it, too—and there was nothing I could do about it.

My chest felt tight, like a mousetrap ready to spring. I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t. I stared at the dark honeycomb windows of the apartment building across the street, wondering if any of them housed my vampire.

From a dead calm, the wind picked up. It blew through my hair, whooshed in my ears, almost like someone muttering. It was.

I couldn’t understand, at first. As always, it seemed to come simultaneously from inside my head yet miles in the distance.

The wind died down. I shut my eyes and concentrated.

“Very close now,” the paper-thin voice of an old man rasped. A warning? I couldn’t recognize the speaker, but the accent sounded a lot like my Lithuanian client whose dead husband I’d failed to reach earlier that week. Seemed I’d made contact, after all.

I stared at the inner wrist of my hand clutching the blood-spotted nightgown, blue veins branching beneath translucent skin, anesthetized to the fear.

“Almost here,” he said.

The dead had no reason to lie, and I was grateful to him for his counsel. I knew then what I had to do.

I flung the nightgown over the balcony, it floated to the street below like a white flag of surrender. With both hands, I gripped the cold railing and leaned forward.

A buzzing from the bedroom. My cell phone. Automatically, I walked inside, lifted it from the nightstand, and fingered it to life. I had a text and a voicemail.

The text was a dimly lit photo of Arianne with an older man. She wore too much eyeshadow, dyed yellow curls piled atop her head in a parody of elegance, evening gown cut desperately low. The man had a full head of white hair and was dressed in a tuxedo. He looked at something off camera, hand resting on the inside of Arianne’s upper thigh.

In her voicemail, Arianne explained how she and Gil would be coming back into town that weekend and that she wanted me to meet him.

“Gil’s very generous, you have no idea. I really hit the jackpot.” A few seconds of silence before Arianne went on. “But he’s got these quirks. And part of our arrangement is that I take care of them. So...” Arianne sighed. “I showed him your picture. And, well, he’s interested. Which is why I need you to do me this one teensy favor and—”

Disgusted, I flung the phone across the bedroom, Arianne’s voice still whining out demands from the carpet. Was she serious? As if I’d ever—

A thought jolted me like a cattle prod, and I leaned against the wall for support. Oh my God. Oh my God, it was *her*. It’d been her all along.

All the times I’d held that needy little floozy in my arms, consoling her after the latest guy tossed her away like a used tissue. The hours I’d spent listening to her drunken blubbering over the mess that was her life, her fading looks, the wrong choices she somehow couldn’t stop making.

All the times I told myself she was a bad friend, how she took and took and never gave back. That the next time she banged on my door late at night, I’d ignore her.

But I never had the guts. I always let her in.

My neck tingled where I’d been bitten, and I scratched. When I took my hand away, my nails were streaked with red, like a sexy polish.

Unable to resist a sudden impulse, I plunged my fingers into my mouth and slurped up the blood.

Coppery sweet with a dash of salt, I was horrified to find that I was delicious.
