**Chapman:** Miss Ross, I’m obligated to inform you that we are as of now, recording this interview. Anything you say from this point forward will be on the record. Is that clear?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Yeah. Sure… Whatever. 

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Alright. Now, it’s my understanding that you’ve turned yourself in to confess to the murder of Guadalupe Dominguez, is that correct?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Yeah. Just… Ask whatever the fuck you’ve got to ask. Say what you need to say. Whatever. Just… Just don’t make me go back home tonight.

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Don’t… Do you mind if I ask you why not?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Because she’ll be waiting for me. That’s why. She always is. Every night, that fucking *cunt* is there… *Torturing me* for what I did to her, like she didn’t have it *fucking coming* in the first place!

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** You’re referring to Dominguez? The late Guadalupe Dominguez?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Who the fuck else would I be talking about? Every night, I wake up dancing and it’s because of *her*!

&#x200B;

*\[There is approximately a 12 second pause in the audio here.\]*

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Okay… Let’s walk through this… Dominguez. Do you mind if I ask why you claim to have murdered her?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Because I did! And let me make one thing clear, I’m not sorry for it, okay? I don’t regret what I did. **I don’t.** Trust me, if you knew the bitch, you would’ve done the same thing! 

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Did you know that I put up with her abuse for four years? Four fucking years! Four years of dreading going into practice, knowing that the slightest fuck up would’ve resulted in me being chewed out in front of the rest of the goddamn company and feeling nothing but relief, whenever that woman decided to pick on someone else and tear them a new asshole, instead of me! I want you to let that sink in for a moment. When watching our ballet coordinator rip someone else a new asshole because they made a mistake during *practice*, all I could feel was *relief* that it wasn’t me! That’s fucked up!

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** And this was why you killed Dominguez?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** No shit, that’s why I killed Dominguez. And as much as I’ve suffered for it, I’d do it again in a fucking heartbeat! 

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Right… Miss Ross, can you describe the murder to me?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Yeah… Yeah, I can… Right. So… let me just back this up really quick. Dominguez… Part of why she was such a pain in the goddamn ass was the dietary restrictions. Obviously, we need to be in shape. But she was weirdly obsessive about it. No sugar. Only certain meats and vegetables. If she caught you eating outside of her diet plan, you caught shit. Well… Part of her diet plan, included no sweets. Zero. Which was kinda funny, because this bitch had the biggest fucking sweet tooth I’d ever seen. Like, you never saw her stuffing her face, but there was always evidence of it. Discarded candy wrappers, empty trays of grocery store cupcakes in the garbage. I’m pretty sure she bought them and then just fucking demolished them in her office when nobody was around… Look, if it were anyone else, I wouldn’t have really judged. I mean, whatever. Dominguez She was somewhere in her sixties and looked more like somebodys grandma, puttering around an impossibly pink house. She wasn’t really a dancer anymore. But the way she’d flip out on some of us for eating one fucking dessert on holiday, then sneak off to her office to eat an entire goddamn cake was kinda hypocritical… Look, my point is, I knew that she liked sweets and I knew that if I brought some in, nobody else but Dominguez was going to fucking touch them. 

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** So you used that to get to her?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Yeah… I’m not half bad at baking. I made some cupcakes, added a little something to them and brought them in on my friends birthday. I came in pretty early when I knew Dominguez would be the only one there. I caught a fucking earfull about how I was trying to ruin the company by breaking everyones diet, but it was worth it. The cupcakes were gone before lunch. Nobody else got one. Just her. I don’t know if the cupcakes tasted any good… Hell… I wasn’t a hundred percent sure it would even kill the bitch… But God, I really, really hoped it would…

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Evidently it did.

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Yeah… She ended up leaving practice early. While she was doing that, I went through her office. Her garbage was filled with the cupcake wrappers, so I took it out, replaced it with a new bag and tossed the trash into a dumpster down the street. Then I took my plate home and waited… Two days later, we got the call. The bitch was found dead in her house, and you know what? Nobody shed a single fucking tear. Which was kinda funny if you ask me… You know, the way she used to carry on, I always got the impression that once upon a time she’d been some big shot in the spanish ballet scene. I mean, she never fucking shut up about it… But I guess if she was half as big a deal as she thought she was, she wouldn’t be working at some small time California Ballet company, and maybe somebody, somewhere might’ve given a shit that she died… I remember one of my friends at the company said: *‘I hope she gets to spend two hours in heaven, before the Devil finds out she’s dead*.’ And yeah… Yeah, I fucking got that… Oh man, the best part was that when we heard the news, people were saying it was a suicide! I killed that bitch *and I fucking got away with it!*

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** And yet now here you are… Do you mind if I ask why?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** I already told you why! *Because she came back for me!*

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** And now every night you wake up dancing?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Yes! I don’t know how. I don’t know what the fuck is going on, but I know she come back for me every night! *That fucking bitch won’t leave me alone!* I just want to sleep, but I can’t! She won’t let me, all because she doesn’t realize that she deserved to be dead!

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** I see… Can you tell me more about what you mean by that?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** What the fuck else do you need to know!?

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Miss Ross. Please. Just relax. I’m not swearing at you. Can you not swear at me?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Fine, fine… I’m not… Christ… It started a few nights after I killed Dominguez… I started having these dreams about her. Being in practice with her again, only it was just me and she was just being her usual awful self. She was standing at the end of the room, with that ugly purple blazer she wore and her big cat eye glasses and she was barking at me like a drill instructor, making me go through routine after routine and she wouldn’t let me rest and I just… I just did it… And when I woke up, I was just standing in my bedroom, and my muscles hurt, like I’d been dancing. I thought I was sleepwalking or something at first. I’ve never done that before but I don’t know, I’d just killed someone! I figured maybe it was fucking with my head or something!

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** I see, and this nightmare is what made you turn yourself in?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** That nightmare? No. *The nightmares I’ve had for the past two months.* Look at this… Just… Look…

&#x200B;

*\[There is a rustling sound of movement, along with a wince of pain from Ross.\]*

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** Miss Ross, it’s not necessary for you to show me your… Oh…

&#x200B;

**Ross:** *Look at what she did to my feet!* I can barely fucking walk! I haven’t been able to go to practice in two weeks! She doesn’t let me rest! The doctor said… Christ, I might lose some of my other toes… Look at this! Every night, I dream about that bitch! Every night I wake up dancing and every night it hurts more, and more, and more! 

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** I… I see…

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Do you? I’ve tried everything… I tried talking to someone about the dreams. I tried calling someone who said they could get rid of ghosts. Last week I tried handcuffing myself to my own fucking bed and I woke up, to find the handcuffs gone! Somehow, something unlocked them! *I can’t do this anymore*! I can barely fucking walk! I can’t drive! I can’t work! I can’t sleep! *She won’t let me!* I don’t have anything else to try. I just want it to fucking stop! 

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** And you believe that by turning yourself in, it might?

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Detective, what else have I got to lose at this point? Do what you have to do. Just make sure I sleep tonight, *please*. Because I don’t want to do this anymore! *I can’t!*

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** I see… Miss Ross, given what you’ve said to me I’m placing you under arrest for the murder of Guadalupe Dominguez.

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Thank you…

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions. 

&#x200B;

*\[There is movement, and the sound of Ross being handcuffed.\]*

&#x200B;

**Ross:** Oh God, thank you…

&#x200B;

**Chapman:** You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.
