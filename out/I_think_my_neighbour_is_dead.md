So I moved into this apartment awhile ago, I’m staying here while I complete my bachelors (‘oh why not just live on campus’ have you seen those prices?? And I don’t even get an oven.) anyways, It’s a small, pretty cute, the couple next to me are nice, though I don’t think there’s anyone in the other one next to me. Like, the girlfriend, let’s call her Trish. Trish said someone had moved in there like a year ago? But they never saw anyone come in or out. Just packages showing up at their doorstep and then disappearing the next time you check. 

There’s also ZERO noise from in there. Which wouldn’t be a bad thing, and it isn’t, but this apartment is pretty old, the walls are pretty damn thin and I can usually hear Trish and her boyfriend talking if I’m quiet enough. But I NEVER hear anything from next door. Which wouldn’t bother me normally, but like…it’s weird. How can you live in complete silence? I thought the dude that lived there was maybe just a shut in. Like the kind that don’t ever leave their house and order food and stuff, which I mean, whatever. It’s your life. But even those people make noise, usually they have their video games or movies cranked up and you gotta yell at them because you don’t wanna hear anime girls moaning every 20 minutes. 

But there’s zero sound. Well, kinda, I got curious a few weeks ago and I pressed my ear to the wall, there wasn’t anything but I heard like…a shuffling? It was really faint and quiet but then it got super close, it sounded like whoever it was, was standing right next to me on the other side of the wall. then it went silent again. Super creepy yeah?

Well shits gotten worse. I was talking to Trish the other day and she had mentioned how there were tons of packages and mail left at that doorstep. Usually I pay no mind to the apartment but how did I miss that? I asked her about it some more and she had said that they’d been building up for like days now. She said she was surprised no one had stole anything. I agreed with her and then we ate dinner like normal, but on my way out I decided to take a peak at the doorstep. There was a ton of these brown boxes, no symbol or icon as to who shipped them just a sticker with the address on it and supposedly the owner ’s name.

‘Micheal’ 

So that’s his name? I don’t know what I was expecting to be honest. But just as I was going to grab the package I smelt like…the worst thing you could ever smell. It smelled like shit. Actually shit. And lots of it. There was also a really pungent coppery smell, and the smell of something rotting. I freak out, ran into my apartment and sprayed the whole place with fabreez. I know huffing chemicals is bad for you but whatever the hell that smell was? Had to be worse. I texted Trish and told her about it, she told me to call the landlord anc get him to take a look. Rick, our landlord, is a pretty old dude, I don’t want to bother him with all this, I decided to leave it for now. 

But then, just last night, I was watching one of those stupid YouTube video essays on a true crime story. One about a girl who fused to her couch. And anyways, as he was describing it, I recognized the smell he was talking about. The one from the other day. But that was months of rot…so if my neighbour is supposedly dead…who the fuck was walking around while I was listening?
