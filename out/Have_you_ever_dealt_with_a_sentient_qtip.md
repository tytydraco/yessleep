So, you know those double sided q-tips you use for makeup application or cleaning out your ears? I discovered a sentient one. 

Let me start this off by saying, I’m a twenty three year old female. I live alone in a decent sized apartment in a fairly busy suburb. My name is Ava, but I don’t think that’s important to my story. 

Now, I’m sure many of you have bought a-tips at some point in your life. I mean come on, they’re sold at practically every convenience store, at every Cub or Walmart or Walgreens. Im sure when it boils down to it, there are very few stores that *don't* sell q-tips, even if they’re just the generic ones called cotton swabs. 

Well, my story begins a couple weeks ago, so let’s start there. I was getting ready to go out and I grabbed a few q-tips to help blend my makeup. Something about one of them felt… I dunno, off. Like there was this unsettling aura coming off of it that shouldn’t be, because it’s just an inanimate object, right? I use it anyway, despite the odd feeling, like an idiot. As some eye shadow smeared onto the cotton, the aura changed from unsettling to almost threatening. My body jolted and the q-tip fell from my hands and onto the floor of my bedroom. 

I tried to put it out of my mind as I got ready, and as I’m about to leave the room, I grab it and throw it out with the others before heading out for a fun night with friends. When I get home and put my car keys on top of the cabinet by the front door, I jump. Sitting there, right beside my key dish, is a used q-tip I didn’t put there. As I take note of the makeup smudge, I realize it’s the same one from earlier. 

I once again throw it away before heading to bed. When I wake up, slightly hungover, I see the q-tip on my nightstand next to my cup of water. It looks like the same one. But that can’t be possible, right? 

So now, whenever a smudged q-tip shows up, I throw it out. But every time, it appears somewhere where I’m guaranteed to find it, to see it. On the the bathroom counter, by the soap. Sitting on the edge of the kitchen table. On my vanity where I get ready. And each time the q-tip reappears, it’s bigger. The growth was subtle at first, barely noticeable. But now it’s around five feet. The plastic stick in the center is much thicker. There’s far more cotton on the swabs. I can’t throw it out anymore. Hell, it’s kind of heavy. 

A couple days ago, when I woke up, it was in bed with me. Under the covers. The aura still menacing. After doing my morning business in the bathroom, I headed to the kitchen to make breakfast. As I do so, I kid you not, I feel cotton brush against my arm. But it stings, almost burns. I turned around, and there, right behind me, is the q-tip. Somehow standing on its smudged swab. 

I looked at my arm next, but figure there’s no point, because there’s no way a q-tip could harm me… right? But when I looked down, at my arm, where it brushed against me, not only is my literal skin smudged… I can see my bone. I screamed. Loud. It doesn’t hurt though, so I pinch myself, figuring I must be dreaming. But I don’t wake up. 

It’s been a couple days since it smudged me. Since I was first able to see my bone. I still can. It hasn’t changed. My bone is still there… like the q-tip just smudged everything off, leaving a round crater at the bottom of which I can see my arm bone. 

I’m writing this now because I need help. Twenty minutes ago, the cotton of the q-tip brushed up against my leg. And now it’s like my arm. Skin that has seemingly been smeared away, just disappeared. But the bone is still there beneath the smudged away skin. I still can’t feel any sort of pain, but I also know that this is real. 

And I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to turn to, because I fear they’ll think I’m crazy. What if others can’t see my smudged away skin? What if it looks normal to others, even though the skin and flesh is definitely gone, and they think I’m crazy and lock me up? I think it’s going to slowly smudge me away, like I used it to smudge my makeup. Does anyone know what I should do? This is both a plea for help and a warning… if a q-tip seems off to you, whatever you do, don’t use it.
