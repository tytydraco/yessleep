This is my second and final post.

As you can imagine, everything soured after the horrifying demise of Zack and Gracie — who weren’t even *a couple*, mind you, so I suppose Mr Wilson’s elimination rule was a lie. People’s true coarseness showed. I suppose the fight for survival corrupts a person more than the fight for wealth.

“Callum and Billie-Jo should sacrifice themselves,” Han said. “It’s *their* fault that Zack and Gracie are dead.”

“*What*?” Billie-Jo gasped. “I didn’t ask Callum to save me.”

“Fuck off,” Han scoffed. “We all knew you two liked each other.”

“Why did the island even take Zack and Gracie? It should’ve…” Kofi began, trailing off.

“No, go on,” Callum pressed, scowling. “Finish your fucking sentence, bitch. Maybe you and Han should be taken next. You’re a shit couple. In nearly a month, all you’ve done is hold hands and peck each other on the lips. Is that true love?”

“Oh, are we moving slower than you and Billie-Jo? Have you fucked already or something?” Han asked. “No wonder you’ve got seven kids.”

Matthew stepped between Han and Callum before a brawl commenced. Meanwhile, I was contemplating the implications of the second note that had been slipped under our front door. The note that had instigated such violence:

*Breaking rules comes with a punishment. Elimination Day has been pushed to Tuesday. And, due to unfortunate events, we’ve had to wrap up the show sooner than expected. This is the final. Our winning couple will be crowned at midnight.*

As I suspected, Mr Wilson and the other sinister minds behind DozMinus were well aware of the last Reddit post I made. What other rule-break could have provoked such a drastic change of schedule? But if you’ve come to this post hoping for answers about that cultist company, prepare to be disappointed. I can only tell you of the horrors that the island revealed last night.

“It is time!” Mr Wilson roared.

Around eleven in the evening, the malignant man burst into the villa, and the six of us leapt to our feet. We were half-asleep in the lounge area. I think we’d all been prepared to attempt a grand escape when the door opened, but the sight of the cult leader and his dozens of followers quickly quashed that dream.

“Please, Mr Wilson,” Billie-Jo begged.

“*Please, Mr Wilson*,” The man mocked, side-eyeing one of the cameras with a shit-eating grin on his face. “I know your brain is the size of a peanut, Billie-Jo, but try to keep up. I’m not the one who calls the shots here. We all serve the island.”

I put my arm around the poor girl’s shoulders as we were shepherded from the villa to what could only be our certain doom. The mass of cult followers surrounded us, preventing our escape, and I prepared to be led back to the horrifying pit of corpse-like arms beneath the forest floor. But Mr Wilson led us to the beach.

*And every test is different.*

When we reached a circle of tall torches in the sand, I wondered what fresh torture awaited us. Matthew squeezed my hand.

“It’s going to be okay,” He lied.

“Six contestants,” Mr Wilson loudly announced to the surrounding cameras. “A month of love draws to a swift close. I know, I know. I hear you. We’re all disappointed about the shortness of this series. But love doesn’t take long to blossom. It’s pre-programmed. A primal truth. It has an origin beyond our comprehension. There is something that science cannot explain about that bond between two perfect mates. But the island knows. It knows us better than we know ourselves. And it is ready to set mankind back on its rightful course. No more ill-suited pairings. Pure, naturally-selected generations shall reign on this Earth. It all begins on this island with *Origin of Love*.”

“*Origin of Love*,” The cult chanted.

“Two of you are meant to be together,” Mr Wilson gleefully informed us. “We don’t know which two. Every watcher has a favourite couple, but only the island knows.”

*Who’s even watching this?* I wondered.

“Only the island knows,” The followers repeated from the darkness.

“So, tonight, the finalists compete for more than £500,000 — they compete for the future of humanity. *Let the island decide*!” Mr Wilson screamed.

Decaying arms did not emerge from the sand beneath our feet. And somehow, that frightened me more. Perhaps I would’ve been comforted by a Hell that I could’ve anticipated.

Large walls of sand suddenly erupted upwards, forming a dome around the edge of the torches and sealing us from the outer world. The six of us found ourselves trapped in the beach’s cage, and I shrieked as the floating grains of sand started to swallow Kofi. But it wasn’t sand at all. It was a *living thing*. The wall began devouring her flesh. Slowly. Excruciatingly.

“Kofi!” Han cried.

As he attempted to retrieve his partner from the wall of sand that slowly stripped the skin from her bones, the levitating grains began to tear into Han’s flesh too. He screeched more painfully than Kofi, and I could only gasp in disbelieving fear at the sight before me. The whites of their skeletons started to show.

“Like their love, their death is slow and dull,” Mr Wilson bellowed from beyond the sand dome. “But Kofi, lover of horror, meets a fitting end.”

His voice carried over the haunting screams of the couple. As the pair began to collapse into bloody pools of their stripped skin, their screams fizzled into whispers. Eventually, the fleshless lovers lay still on the beach. Matthew shivered uncontrollably, and I could tell that he was striving to prove Mr Wilson wrong. He didn’t want to be weak-willed. But we all looked weak in that moment.

“The island decides,” The cult members chanted.

“Which of our finalists will go the distance?” Mr Wilson asked. “The island will now choose our winning couple!”

With a deranged glint in his eyes, Callum sprinted across the sand towards us. Matthew plucked his hand from mine and stepped forwards, shielding me from the maniac who was barrelling blindly onwards. But then the four of us stood still. A gargantuan grumbling quaked the sand beneath our feet. It filled me with horror — I didn’t want to know what lurked below the island.

Without warning, Callum started plummeting into a darkened chasm that was forming in the sand. His cries of agony rapidly abated as he fell to whatever frightful fate awaited him. The hole spread outwards, and Billie-Jo screeched as her leg tumbled into the opening. She managed to pull herself onto the sand, but she and I both gawped in terror at the bloody stump where her lower calf had been. Something in the hole had feasted on her leg. Gripped by horror beyond explanation, I skirted around the outer edge of the sand cavity, heading towards her. Matthew followed.

It wasn’t the screaming, legless girl that horrified me. Not the death of Callum. Not even the corpses of Han and Kofi which tumbled into the opening. It was the thing I saw when I peered for the briefest moment over the edge of the pit.

*Nothing*.

Nothing itself. An absence that I can’t put into words. An abyss that truly stared back into my soul. No eyes. No features. No discernible anything. But that nothingness was *something*, and that’s all I know with any certainty. Something saw me. Something beneath the island. A nightmare no human should ever witness.

Whilst Matthew and I dragged Billie-Jo away from the edge of the hole, the walls of sand began to cascade, filling the hellish pit. We found ourselves facing a beach littered with cult members. Illuminated by the torches, Mr Wilson’s face was not sinister at all. He was overjoyed. And perhaps that was worse than a malevolent smile.

“Congratulations!” He cried. “The island has left one couple standing. Becky and Matthew, you're this year’s winners of *Origin of Love*! Your primal bond prevailed.”

The crowd began chanting that awful, dissonant, wordless song. I cradled Billie-Jo’s dying body in my arms. As the cult began to move towards the sea edge, Mr Wilson walked over to us and eyed the pale-faced social media influencer in the sand.

“Callum, a blackness, has returned from the void which created him. Billie-Jo remains, but the island does not save individuals,” He said. “Only romantic mates are worthy.”

Speechless, the three of us watched in terror as the cult boarded the boat that had brought us to the island. Billie-Jo weakly urged us to go, but Matthew and I didn’t even attempt to flee. How could we have overpowered the hundreds of DozMinus cultists?

Their ship set sail, leaving Billie-Jo, Matthew, and me behind.

It’s Thursday afternoon. When the generator runs out of fuel, I suppose the router will switch off, and I won’t be able to connect to the internet again. So, I guess these might be my final words to the world. I’ll try to make them count.

Billie-Jo quickly succumbed to her injuries. I keep thinking about her body in my arms. There’s something haunting about physically feeling a person’s life fading away.

“If it’d... been a normal show, do you think... I would’ve won?” She weakly whispered, smiling.

I grinned, wiping my tears. “With your banging body and double-barrelled name? Of course. You were *made* to win a reality show.”

A solitary tear trickled down Billie-Jo’s face, but she continued to smile. “I just wish I had more… time.”

Something about those simple words — Billie-Jo’s final utterance — put the true horror of the island into perspective. So many lives extinguished. For what? Some ancient power that determines mankind’s mating suitability? Mr Wilson may believe that, but I don’t.

This island is evil. That’s it. There is no method to the madness. We can dilute that terrifying fact by assigning meaning to the thing that lurks beneath the surface, as I suppose that’s what humans do best. We explain things. But we can’t explain this. We don’t understand it.

This place is a cancer. It feasts. It doesn’t care about love. I may have won the show, but should I be grateful that my life was spared? As I type, hours after last night’s events, I can’t help but watch Matthew. He’s still staring at the ocean, though the DozMinus boat has long-disappeared beyond the horizon. I think he’s contemplating ending things. Call it intuition. Our ‘primal bond’. Whatever.

I think his escape plan might be the only one we have.
