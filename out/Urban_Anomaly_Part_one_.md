This document will contain information regarding my latest experience in urbex, (urban exploration.) My name is Powell Porter, and recently I have gotten into urban exploration. It seemed fairly harmless at first, if not comforting. I have always enjoyed adventuring, especially in more “liminal” spaces. 

I’d recently discovered an abandoned mall that was relatively close to me by urbex standards. In reality, it was around 680 miles away, but I’d always enjoyed a good road trip. Overall, it seemed typical enough. Of the few images I could find of it, the place just seemed run of the mill. 

The building was sprawling with vines and thick grass even as far back as 13 years ago. Parts of the structure were on the verge of collapse, and there even seemed to be signs of a forest fire indicated by several scorch marks along the face of the building. 

I couldn’t find any more pictures of the site before then. At least not in its current, arguably more interesting condition. 

The place had been closed for almost 20 years and it was in an empty lot miles from the nearest town. It was a prime target, so I put the address into Maps, only to find the location blacked out. This intrigued me, as that wasn’t usual for commercial sites. I should note that I don’t encourage trespassing, but something about the mall was drawing my attention. Despite my reservations, I found myself thinking about it again and again. I don’t make that exception anymore. 

I left it to the recesses of my mind for a few weeks, but mentioned it in passing to one of my buddies who had recently picked up urbex from a mutual contact. He seemed pretty stoked to check it out, even more than me, and he even offered his drone so we could scout the place more easily. I was hesitant, but ultimately accepted after a bit of discussion. 

Any adventurer worth their salt knows that exploring these kinds of places alone is a recipe for trouble. I usually opted to bring my dog along on my expeditions, but I decided to leave him behind on this one. I couldn’t be sure it would be safe for him. 

Initially, something in my gut tugged at me to stay back—to keep myself far away from that place. I interpreted it as a fear of being caught, or getting hurt and not being able to get out. Something which had almost happened in the past. I do not recommend trying to climb up any rickety ladders you may encounter within any old warehouses. 

With all that in mind, we prepared a short list of things to do once we arrived: 

1) Check for people or nearby vehicles. If there’re people around they may find you suspicious, or worse. You don’t want to spend your night explaining to the cops that you’re only there to take photographs. And you definitely don’t want to get into a physical confrontation. You’re better off avoiding the hassle and staying out of sight. Trust me. 

2) Make sure there aren’t any cameras or active security systems that might catch you off guard. This goes pretty much for the same reasons as point one, except the chances of finding trouble are much greater. The only trace you want to leave are footsteps. Respect the property and it just might respect you. 

3) Locate all available entry points and windows. You will need to know how and where you can get in or out, especially if there is an emergency. To reiterate, being injured and not having an exit plan is very, very bad. 

4) Perhaps most importantly, text a schedule of where you are and when you expect to be back to someone you trust. This also sort of plays into rule 3. 

The list seemed like enough at the time, but I could add a dozen more rules after everything. Not that they’d help me any now. 

Other than that, we scrounged a few masks, some water, snacks, heavy boots and gloves, several layers of clothing, flashlights, portable tents, spare gas, and a pocket knife. I’d never needed to actually use the knife before, but it was always better to be prepared when venturing into unknown spaces. 

Unfortunately, it isn’t too uncommon for these types of places to be occupied with squatters and/or drug addicts looking for a lowkey spot to get loaded. I’ve had my fair share of spooky encounters with less-than-friendly people, but once they see that I’m armed, I get no trouble finding my way back out. 

When we arrived, there wasn’t anything overtly negative or wrong about the place. The vibe was a bit off, but we both chalked it up to nervousness. At that point, we had driven 15 hours and we were determined to find something interesting. There was no going back at that point. 

Fortunately, there weren’t any vagrants or junkies there, but we had other troubles to ameliorate. 

Navigating the extreme flora would’ve been difficult, especially since it was already past midnight. I had immediately realized that my dinky little toy wouldn’t be enough to cut through the thick vines and weaves of branches that barricaded the mall. 

We were nowhere near energized enough to deal with the wall of thorns and shrubs by then. The drive had been hell, and we were both teetering on exhaustion. My friend, who I’ll refer to as James from now on, could read my thoughts from the expression on my face and responded with a similar glare. 

We decided to set up our tents for the night and get some well deserved shut-eye. In the morning, we’d look up the closest hardware store for a couple nice machetes to expedite the process. We just needed sleep above all else. 

It was ultimately a good decision to not bring my dog, as he would have kept us up all night. As we tried to sleep, I could feel it in the air that it wouldn’t be easy, and something told me James had the same problem. Strange noises permeating the air didn’t make it any better. Neither one of us had said anything at first, probably both just hoping it was our imagination, but the sound of screeching and squealing repeated through the night.

It was hard to ignore, and I was beginning to get very tense, but my lack of energy prevented me from getting up. That was until some time later when I finally managed in a good 40 minutes. 

Out of nowhere, the same sound woke me, now louder and more clearly than ever. I heard James begin to shout from his tent. He was cursing and yelling right back at the noise. I couldn’t make out what he was saying but he was not happy. 

Neither of us were huge believers of the supernatural. But we both enjoyed a good horror story, and this had the makings of one. It was all part of the “plot,” something to fixate on. It’s what drew me towards urban exploration in the first place. There was seldom a dull moment. I’d only made the mistake of assuming that was a good thing.

With the newly established energy from my moment of respite, I had slowly climbed out from my thick woolen covers and unzipped the tent door. The air was thick with fog, and other than the occasional yap from whatever creature was lurking, there was neither a living sound nor a sense of anything resembling civilization.

The sky was so damn black that I couldn’t see my hand stretched more than two feet. My cheery outlook was beginning to falter, and telling myself it was all part of some story didn’t do much when real life felt so much more real now than ever before. 

There was no wind or rain, but the night was deathly cold. Never had I felt such a sudden onset of blistering frost before then.

I found myself standing completely frozen in place, just staring out in whatever direction was hiding in the darkness. The sound of the tent opening beside me caused me to jump, and I nearly fell over. 

James looked at me like he thought I’d seen a ghost and asked me what all the commotion was. I told him I had no clue, and that's what I was out for. 

We both agreed to walk around a bit and do some investigating. We weren’t total morons, though, so we stuck close by. I had a five foot harness attached to his belt loop, ensuring neither of us got lost or fell down any unseen ditches. 

The screeching had soon resumed as we set off from our campsite, and I could feel James shaking through the vibrations in the rope. I asked him if he was doing alright and offered the walk behind him but he didn’t respond. I knew he was just as if not more on edge than I was. Only I had perfected the art of maintaining composure, or false confidence. 

We whispered back and forth about what the sounds could be, and we debated between a few different options. We both decided that it had to be some sort of dog or doglike animal, but we couldn’t agree on which kind exactly. The idle banter soothed the feeling of unease slightly, and it made the walk a hell of a lot more pleasant.

The sound was consistent in location at that point, so we knew roughly which direction it was coming from. We traveled toward it slowly hoping to catch the culprit off guard and scare it off. Neither of us would ever get any rest with whatever that thing was yammering through what little early morning was left. 

It was obvious that James was growing exponentially more anxious by the second. I didn’t know what to say. I hadn’t ever seen him that way before. I told him we were going to be fine, and he feigned agreement as we headed forward, more slowly now. 

The sound was incredibly unnerving at that point, and almost ear splitting. I’d felt an oncoming headache which only made me more concerned with tracking our annoying friend. 

As we crept along the ridge of the hillside, we slowly lifted our flashlights to reveal a little fox. No goblins or gremlins. It was just a pup. Instantly James and I felt relieved. It was only a small thing. The harmless creature seemed abandoned, with no parents in sight nor any siblings. Our next course of action wasn’t very clear, but we definitely couldn’t scare it off now. 

It came down to soothing the animal or sucking it up and dealing with the incessant cries. I thought we could give it some of our jerky. But James began to protest some potential concerns with feeding the small animal processed food. However, it seemed like the only easy option at the time.

We weren’t sure it would necessarily work, but trying was better than tiring. So I cut up a stick of honey glazed turkey with my knife and gently tossed the pieces towards the animal, making sure to not blind it with the light. 

At first it didn’t seem all too interested, although it did cease the whining. After a few moments, it began to cautiously move toward the treat, and then swiftly jumped at it gobbling several chunks at once. 

Then we noticed something peculiar. As the fox moved, it revealed several small items concealed within a poorly dug hole. James and I weren’t exactly concerned, but it didn’t seem normal. You’re probably wondering what the big deal was: people leave behind trash everywhere. It’s sort of human nature. However, these objects weren’t trash. Each seemed to glisten and glow. They looked ornate and almost clean, despite being sunken into the loose soil. 

What the fuck? I thought to myself. And James recanted the same out loud. It was probably smarter to come back in the morning but an odd feeling told me they might be gone by then. 

I began to take a short step anyway, but James tugged my arm. He whispered with a raspy voice, asking me what I was trying to do. I told him we should check out whatever the fox was laying on, but he seemed scared by the proposal. It wasn’t necessarily a conscious fear, but he was definitely acting more unnerved. Not just anxious as he had been, but genuinely distraught. 

He couldn’t hide it very well, so
I eventually conceded to calm him down. As we turned back, I made a final glance at the fox and it’s treasures. They continued to sparkle through the pitch black scenery, but the fox had become perfectly hidden. 

I’d begun to understand what James was feeling. The objects did possess a sort of eerie quality to them, so it was likely for the best we leave them be for now. And for what it’s worth, the fox seemed placated. 

Naturally, it didn’t take long for us to pass out pretty much the instant we made contact with the tent floor. What was otherwise a poor coverage that offered little comfort, felt like a pleasure palace at this point. 

By the time I had woke up, James was already outside with a fire. He had a mini grill that he kept in his truck, so we were set for breakfast. I bought some eggs before we left and he had cheese and bread. Looking back, the meal was more or less mediocre, but I was starving, and my stomach was rumbling something fierce. 

If James told me Gordon Ramsay himself pulled up and prepared our meal I wouldn’t have argued. Honestly, I was so damn hungry I’d considered snatching his plate for a second. Now, I like to think of myself as a pretty decent person, so I staved off my primal urges for the time being. 

We used the moment to relax and get to know the immediate area. Of course, we could see that the mall was blocked off by branches and other nuisances—it was practically the nightmare of any landscaper—but the area we were sitting in was just as important for now. We needed to get used to the campsite, as cutting through the bush could take longer than anticipated. Best case scenario I figured is we’d open a safe path to the mall by the following afternoon. 

I asked James if he’d brought any beer along, but he looked slightly puzzled, and told me it had completely slipped his mind. I let out a loud groan and gave him a stare of death. But an obnoxious smirk grew on his face and he lightly punched my shoulder. 

He bent over revealing a four pack beside him. I was not entertained. If that was all, he may well have kept the case a secret. But then he pointed out a cooler by his tent packed to the gills with all sorts of fun beverages and I grew excited enough to do a dance right then and there. Last night was a distant moment, and things were beginning to look up. 

While I kept the dancing to a strictly mental capacity, I did enjoy a few cold drinks, 
and we bounced a couple jokes off each other to pass the time. Eventually, we began to discuss the drones and where we should scout first. I argued the back was more important for now, as I had already gotten a decent look of the frontside online. He was fairly neutral, but did seem more or less eager to check out the entrance first. 

He was showing me how to activate the drone when a foul stench seeped into our campsite. At once we both started to cough and cover our noses. James wheezed and begged for a mask, so I started to run back to the car to grab them. Like an asshole, I had completely forgotten to bring them down with us, so I had to travel the whole way back. 

It was a good two minute jog, and while my endurance was pretty strong, I preferred to avoid cardio whenever possible. 

The vehicle peaked over the horizon, but the smell grew stronger. It was coming just off the path to the left. I debated ignoring it and heading straight to the car, but I had to check it out first. I shielded my mouth as the smell became more intense, and I began to recognize the area. 

This was the same place we found that baby fox. My heart began to race and a whip of cold electricity shot down my spine and into the back of my head.

I climbed the hill and peaked down the other side hoping to find our buddy just as disturbed by the odor as we were. I found he was much worse. I couldn’t stop myself from hurling. 

The poor fox was barely even there anymore—reduced to ivory scraps and rotting flesh. The items it had slept upon were now coated in blackened and thick blood.
