"Hey, you wanna hear something crazy? Something that'll make your hair stand on end? I mean, you look like the type who can handle it. You ever feel 
like you're just... different? Like you've got something inside you, something dark, that most people don't understand? Well, I do. And I've done things...
terrible things. But you know what? Sometimes, you just gotta let it out. So, here's what I did the other night and many nights prior..."

I pulled up to the street corner where she worked. I’d seen her there a few times before, so I knew where to go. She stood aloof, acting like she had no
idea why I had pulled my car over to the sidewalk where she stood. 

“Can I help you?” she asked.

“Uh, yeah, I’d like a date,” I replied.

“What are you looking for?”

“A date for the night.” “I’ve got plenty of money,” I said.

“Good, because it’s going to cost you. Let me see what you’ve got.”

I reached over, opened the glove compartment, and pulled out a large roll of money. The bill on the top was a hundred. That’s all she needed to see. 

Before I knew it, she had opened the door and hopped in the passenger seat.

“Let’s party,” she said.

“Oh, we’re going to party,” I replied.

We drove off into the night, past the city limits. Her glee turned to concern. As we ventured deeper into the desolate, moonlit landscape, I sensed uneasiness creeping over her. A chill ran down her spine as she realized the night might not end as she had anticipated. 

To calm her nerves, I offered her the stack of cash, a gesture that both surprised and reassured her. I then handed her a bottle of fine wine, its rich aroma filling the car. As she sipped the wine, her worries began to dissipate. Slowly, she began to trust me, her fear replaced by a sense of curiosity and intrigue.

We pulled through an open gate to my large mansion.

“Wow! You live here?” She asked.

“Yep. All mine,” I replied.

We entered the home where I instantly gave her a soft, gentle kiss on the cheek. "I must feed the beast," I whispered into her ear. She giggled. I took her hand and led her into my bedroom. I picked her up and laid her on the bed. She found to her surprise that she was unable to move, as if glued to the bed.

She screamed as she struggled in vain. "I must feed the beast," I said again to her. I walked over to a button on the wall and pushed it. The floor underneath the bed slowly pulled away to reveal that the bed lay at the center of a large web. From below, a dark figure the size of a small car began to emerge into the light. Its body was flanked by eight large legs. She screamed as its fangs found their mark. It removed her from the bed and then disappeared from where it had come. "I have fed the beast," I whispered to myself.
