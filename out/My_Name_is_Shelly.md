It started just like any other day in the office.

My boss, Bryon got my chattering co-worker's attention in his usual obnoxious way.  He pulled out a megaphone and screeched, "oi, listene, you lot", as loud as he could.  He really thought he was funny, that bryon, but he was not.  If he wasn't one of the directors of land lads leases, i'd tell him that, I thought.

"an anonymous source" he said with finger quotes to the laughter of most of those feather-brained idiots in the room.  "has brought to our attention a supposed 'murder' committed on the premises of the bush track we leased out to the public. " he rolled his eyes and grinned.  "I supposed we should take a look, eh?" there was groans of annoyance from the board members. " come on, don't be a bunch of whiners!" he joked.  "I'm sure it will be a good laugh".  He turned on the video.

a red-haired girl grinned at the camera.  "hello, and welcome to my channel!" she said, giving one of those fake little giggles.  I disliked her instantly.  "I'm destiny, and this was my brother, william!" she trilled.  The darker haired boy next to her sighed wearily.  "please leave me out of this, Des.  He muttered.  "anyway, she said, with a pointed looked at her brother, "I went here today, cause, as you know, i'm very excited to learn about my family history! and guess what? her voice dropped to a theatrical whisper.  " my ancestors house- was right over there!" the camera swung over to the right, and i saw an old house with peeling, dark grey paint in the middle of the bush.  "ready to go inside, kids?" she gasped, stepping into the house, her brother reluctantly trudging along behind her.  "I know I am!"

after that, the video became terrifyingly bizarre.

strange noises seemed to have came from the walls in the background of destiny's  chatter, harmless objects seemed to have moved in the corners of the screen, edging closer and closer towards her and william.  Destiny didn't notice, but her brother looked uneasy, his eyes flitting towards the walls and backed to the door.  Then at some pointed, as though signaled by some unknown leader, objects began to move.  The movements were small at first, a rust-coated toaster falling towards them, bowling balls rolling slightly near them on the floor, but slowly increased until the footage cut to them being chased by a monstrous cupboard.  Destiny was screaming and crying, while william dragged her towards a room, which was empty expect for an old television.  The front door had disappeared behind them.  They dashed into the room and william slammed the door shut behind them.  “I think we’re safe,” he panted.The tv turned on.  And a blurry faced appeared in the middle of the static.  “I hate to disappoint you, but you’re not. ”

“w-what do you want?” destiny sobbed,  pouting in terror.

“isn’t it obvious? I want to play a game,” the face said in a calm, clipped voiced.  “I’ve been bored for so long, but since you’ve seen my face now a quick game’s a good game!” it- no, he (I felt very certain that the creature was male) grinned.  “my turn!” with that, a filthy mannequin dropped down from the ceiling-

and crushed william’s neck.

destiny screamed in horror and tore past the mannequin out the broken window.

the video then cut to destiny limping through the woods.  The mannequin tutted at her.  “you’re being a bad sport,” he said, sounding slightly irritated.  He continued to tore effortlessly through the wood towards her, his long legs eating up the distance between him and her in seconds.  In a last, desperate attempted for survival, destiny ducked behind a tree.  “this is it,” she said softly and sadly.  “I just wanted to say- thank you to all my subscribers for supporting me. ” the camera fell to the ground when the mannequin started to beat her.  I turned away then, unable to watch.  She screamed for a long time before it was quiet.  When i looked up, the video ended.

I glanced around the room.  My co-worker's faces were as white as sheets.  Then the icy silence broke into a storm of sound.  I stared at the screen blankly, my heart pounding.  I someone said something about shutting the bush walked down but this idea was quickly dismissed. Eventually ted noticed my shock.  He kindly (but firmly) told me to take the rest of the day off.

Too shell-shocked to argue, I walked out of the meeting room with my backpack in my hand.  But as i did, something at the back of the room caught my eyed.  A face appeared on the screen of the older tv.  And winked.
