So a few nights ago, I was driving home from my girlfriend’s house. I usually sleep there and leave pretty early in the morning at like 6:00 or 7:00AM. That night, though, I wasn’t really in the mood to sleep. My girlfriend tried to convince me to stay over a little longer but I wasn’t really having it. Plus I had some things I wanted to do on my laptop. Typical for me at that hour, but I’m pretty much nocturnal at this point anyway.

I remember vividly that it was 3:30 in the morning when I left. Her house wasn’t far from mine at all, only about five minutes, give or take during the day with the traffic that the annoying tourists that flood my area this time of year cause. At this hour, of course, there was not a single soul in sight on the roads. Just me and my mom’s old BMW. I’d made the trip probably hundreds of times over the last couple years, so the darkness, lack of people, and quietness didn’t really scare me anymore.

For some reason, though, I felt oddly on edge as I drove home. Not the kind of on edge that one might feel when they're late to work or school or something like that. More the kind of feeling you get when something just feels "off." Something that you don’t quite know or understand but that still keeps you aware. I do have anxiety, and of course my mind just has to exaggerate every single thing that could possibly go wrong, even if it has no chance at all of happening. I could hit a pothole and pop my tires, I could get mugged, I could get pulled over, I could crash my car into a tree…I could hit someone with my car…but was it just anxiety? It felt different…

Anyways, I was cruising down this familiar road I’ve been down a thousand times. In my head I was having one of those long existential conversations that only happen in the middle of the night. My headlights are the sources of light besides some street lamps every now and then or the dim traffic lights that break every other day. I drove past the lights. I was only about a minute from my house at this point, and I was looking forward to flopping into bed and playing on my laptop, maybe watching some YouTube as well…but just as I’m thinking about that, to my right, I see something weird-looking come out of the forest and out towards my car, forcing me to swerve and hit the brakes, forcing me and everything else in my car to lurch forward. I didn’t hear a bump, so at least I didn’t hit…whatever it was. It was dark and so sudden that I didn’t get a good view of it at first. I thought it was an animal of some sort, maybe a deer or coyote, so honestly, I wasn’t all that freaked out. Hey, it would probably be a fun story to tell my friends and family…

But it wasn’t a deer or a coyote at all.

I tried to calm down…but you know, when you have anxiety and your fears suddenly become realized, it’s a bit hard to relax your nerves after that. But after about a minute passed, I thought I was ready to go. As I said before, I didn’t hear any bumps, so I didn’t hit anything, but I expected to at least see the animal keep running to the other side. I didn’t. I didn’t see much of anything actually. Weird, but whatever. Animals are pretty skittish, and it most likely just ran away once it saw me barrelling towards them. I went to put my car back into drive when I saw something…right in front of my car. For like half a split second, I thought it was a coyote…or even a wolf, but we don’t have wolves around here. It was on all fours, staring at me with its huge and expanded eyes, and had two large ears, a long snout, and dark gray patchy fur all over its body. Looking a little closer, I could see its extremely sharp claws and something swaying back and forth behind it, and there were some darker parts on it, but I couldn’t tell what they were. I was frozen. It was probably 10-11 feet in front of me. I didn’t know what to do, so I just sat there with my eyes staring at it. This…had to be a prank of some sort, but this was no prank. I could tell once whatever it was opened its mouth to reveal its razor sharp teeth, a gross diluted tongue that seemed to cut itself as it dragged across the teeth, and what finally revealed itself to be an off-pink tail swishing behind it. 

Why didn’t I just drive away? I know I should have, believe me, I wrestle with that thought every day. But I couldn’t. I sat there frozen as I slowly processed what I was seeing. It couldn’t have been a real animal, not one I knew of anyway. It was too…unnatural. As it focused on me, I could see its pupils getting smaller. There was no way I couldn’t see it. Its eyes were too big. It slowly advanced towards the other lane, more towards the light of my car, it moved weirdly, like it was hurt or something. Now illuminated in the light, it looked like some kind of giant…rat…a fucking huge rat. Yes I know how ridiculous that sounds, but please just listen to me. When I say giant, I mean giant…the thing was like 7 or 8 feet long. Something was dripping off of it, and I found out what the dark parts were. Blood. It was covered in blood. Some parts of its body looked mangled. Was it hurt? Was that its own blood? Or…someone else’s? Of course, I automatically assumed it was the blood of someone else and began to hyperventilate. I had to get out of there. I didn’t know what the fuck this thing was…but I didn’t want to stick around and find out. I made a little plan with myself to just bolt when the thing was out of the way, but as I put it into drive, the…rat? immediately turned my direction and stared at me. I heard these sounds come out of it, like squeaking, and some grunts and hisses. For a moment, the rat got on its hind legs and did some weird…spinning motion…I guess? I don’t know how else to describe it. Now I don’t know why I did this, I literally have no idea so don’t come attacking me for it, I grabbed my phone and took a picture of it.

It didn’t see me take a picture of it, but as I lowered my phone, I saw it fall back down on all-fours and make its way over to my side. My mom’s car can get kinda hot, so I had the window down a bit. I kept repeating “What the fuck!” in my mind over and over again as it approached my window. I had a clear view of it now…and the stench…the stench that breathed forth at me was the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in my life. I’ve smelled some pretty damn horrid things, but this was on a whole other level. I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s like a combination of the stench of dead animals and just general shit. That stench alone was making me wanna throw up. I was just sitting there freaking out as it did this. I also heard these wet slapping sounds as it walked around…probably from the blood it was covered and caked in. 

Now, I’m going to admit something. I was scared. I was fucking scared out of my mind. I’m not the type of person to act like a coward or to be scared all the time, but this thing was so big and scary looking. But for some reason…I still wasn’t panicked. Why? I don’t know. I couldn’t say why…but I wasn’t panicking. I was just…scared. Maybe my mind just shut down completely, trying to rid itself of such a horrible sight, and now I’m thinking it may have, because as it was practically nose to nose with me, I just remember opening my eyes. It was gone…and I was just sitting there, alone. Where the fuck did it go? I know I didn’t imagine it. The mind can conjure up some pretty crazy shit, but not that. That was way too real. I know it fucking happened. I was hyperventilating, I was shaking uncontrollably, I was sweating, I was crying…everything a person would do when they’re that scared. I don’t know why I didn’t call the police right away. In hindsight, I should have. But I did check to see if I was bleeding or something, because something felt wrong with my leg, but I didn’t see anything, thank god.

So, with that small victory, I was able to calm myself down a little, and by the time I had calmed down, it was about 4:00 AM. I just wanted to go home and forget about what just happened. I don’t know what the fuck that thing was, but I couldn’t take it anymore, and I just wanted to go home and sleep for as long as I possibly could. But it wouldn’t be that easy, would it? When I pulled into my driveway and looked towards my house, I immediately noticed something strange. Some of the lights were on and the front door looked like it was gone. Strange…but when I actually got inside…I couldn’t fully comprehend the carnage I was stepping into. My house was a total wreck…everything was broken, smashed, what have you. Everything. I knew my parents were out of town, so it couldn’t have been them. Was my house broken into? Great…I get attacked by a giant rat monster and to make matters even worse, now my house gets broken into, but that’s when I noticed something odd. A blood trail…leading down my hallway. I heard some sounds, like someone ripping apart a piece of meat and sloppily eating it…and then a muffled squeak.

Was it the cat?

No…no way…

I slowly made my way towards the sound…and when I peered down the hallway…I saw it…tall body…gray bloody fur…those ears…ripping pieces off my cat and eating it. I’m…I’m not sure if I can ever fully explain what I felt at that moment, but when I saw it, I was instantly fucking frozen…and I was angry…and…I don’t know. It’s hard to explain. The thing just looked up at me as it finished off the last of its meal, and then…it made a funny sound. I know it sounds crazy, but I honestly can’t explain it. It was like a high pitched squeak with a grunt, but like…weird. It was like it was almost…impersonating something it knew it shouldn’t have been able to make. But it did. It made that sound, and then I was…powerless to do anything…the sound made me lose consciousness…I have no memory of what happened after that…
