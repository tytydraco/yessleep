I took everyone's advice and bought my first gun. I don't know how to use it and my state doesn't require a license, so it may be useless. Still, though, it brings me comfort. 

Several people advised me to go to the police, but, to be honest, I just don't trust them. My brother was arrested in '07 for drug charges with no evidence against him, so I just don't have the faith that they'll come to my aid.

For anyone new to my story, my ex-girlfriend recently sent my - not OUR - 9 year old daughter, Reed, a package containing photos of her posing with my daughter since she was 2, and many threats to injure or kill me in my sleep. 

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I should explain what lead up to this. I need to tell someone, I guess, since nobody in my family cared and I never knew Maggie's family. 

Maggie, real name Margeret Grain, and I met in highschool. Real sweethearts. I was the typical jock-type. Class clown. No hope in the world of graduating with honors credit, lucky to receive a diploma at all. Maggie was the cheerleader. Proud and vain. Always obsessed with perfection. We dated for two years when we discovered she was pregnant. My dumb highschool self assumed it was all my fault, despite us always using protection. I was a stupid kid. I assumed I was untouchable and nothing like this could ever happen to me. Hell, I could barely hold down my job at our local Walmart. God, if only I knew Reed would be the most perfect thing in the entire world. I begged her to have an abortion. I'm not saying it's wrong to have one, just that we weren't ready at the time to have any kids. She insisted on keeping it, so I dumped her with the promise to send her a third of my wages whenever possible. She accepted and moved on. I don't think I ever sent a single penny.

6 months later, she reached back out. I was in between lovers and my highschool girlfriend looked like a good rebound. She said she missed me and wanted me at just one of her baby appointments. So, I went. Fast forward 2 months and Reed was born. After the pregnancy, though, she became... Different. She sat in her room for hours, days, then weeks. All while I worked and tried my best to keep Reed happy. Within that year, she'd become obsessed with rituals involving dead... things. I don't know how to describe it without it seeming like we were endangering Reed. You don't know what weirdos are on here. I'm sure someone's already found where I live and who I am. 

She began leaving her room at night, saying she was going shopping. Shopping with our old, dull butcher knives from the church's thrift store a mile away. She'd come back and strip, tossing her clothes into the washing machine by themselves. For a while, she'd be happy. Happy and willing to care for Reed, which was a relief on me. She'd even breastfeed her, something Maggie had adamantly refused, claiming it to be too perverse. She spent hours alone with Reed, just rocking back and forth in the nude. Singing. Strange songs in a language I didn't understand. Her family is from Polland originally, though, so I just assumed it was in Pollish. If anyone can help me translate, I'll include it in a comment.

And then, one day, she split. She packed everything she could fit into a black duffel bag, excluding the rabbit corpse she'd left splayed out on Reed's crib beside her. Safe to say, it escalated quickly.

Now, today, I sleep when Reed is at school. And when she's at home and asleep, I'm pacing around the house with my shotgun. I'm tempted to make it into a sawed-off shotgun, but I don't know how, and I don't think this is the right place to ask. I've all but boarded up my windows. A guy on TikTok showed me how to ensure my windows were locked at night and how to install cameras. I only have two: one by the front door and one by Reed's bedroom window facing into her room. I wish I could have one by my window, but I can only afford the two and her protection is essential. 

&#x200B;

But still, I feel uneasy. I hear banging at night from the walls of my house. The attic is too small to fit anything besides a small child, so we have a little bit of storage. The ventilation system is loud, too, and the vents above mine and Reed's rooms are so loud at night, I'd swear she was in the walls of my house. I pray I'm just crazy. What should I do about this?

&#x200B;

I'm sorry for the short entry, but this is all I can do right now. I'm exhausted and coffee, redbull, and rum can only take me so far.

Pleaase, help me. Send advice.
