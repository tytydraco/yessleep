I can’t believe I’m writing this.

Don’t steal the cafeteria trays to use as sleds.

No wait, I do believe it.  A college campus full of inhuman creatures and idiots with too much newfound freedom and not enough life experience is a recipe for disasters.  I say that as one of those idiots.

Working at the dining hall has some unexpected benefits.  For one thing, we get free leftovers at the end of the day.  We get paid.  And… that’s about all the benefits I can think of off the top of my head.  I was going somewhere with this but now that I think about it, “finding out about obscure inhuman creatures on campus” might not actually be a benefit.

I’m not talking about the manager.  This is something else.

Before I get into it, let me just update everyone on the thing in the hallway situation.  Other than some absolutely horrific nightmares that I don’t want to talk about, we haven’t made any progress.  I’m not surprised.  We’ve already figured out that all these creatures on campus don’t exist in folklore so the Folklore Society isn’t going to have much luck finding them in the library’s books.  I haven’t been involved in the process.  Maria has declared that this is not my responsibility.  She’ll let me know if she needs help and keep me apprised of what’s going on, but this is something for her to deal with.  She can’t stop anyone in the club from doing something reckless, but she can make sure she’s there to warn them off at every opportunity.  At the very least, she can ensure that they’re fully aware of the very permanent and very fatal consequences of making a mistake.

I’m relieved to have friends to help with this.  I don’t have to do everything alone.

Also I feel like this might mean I don’t fulfill the devil’s request and I’m perfectly okay with that.

Back to the dining hall job.  We’ve been running low on trays.  Yes, those plastic cafeteria trays you use to carry your food and drink to your table with.  It’s not unusual for them to go missing.  People use them to carry their meal back to their dorm and then forget to return them until weeks later, often with accompanying stacks of plates so old they probably belong in the geology department’s fossil collection.  I’m so grateful for industrial dishwashers.  So very very grateful.

There’s another way that the trays go missing though.  I’d just started my shift when the manager called me over to ask me to do a special job.  I was a little nervous, because I *know* my former boss lady has talked to him about the whole… eating… thing… but he hasn’t said a word to me about it.  Fortunately, he decided to have the conversation with me in the kitchen with all the other student employees around rather than, I dunno, in the freezer where they wouldn’t hear my screams.

“I need you to go get the trays,” he said.  “I just saw a group leaving with some too, so tell them to cut it out while you’re at it.”

I stared blankly at him for a moment.  Was I supposed to go door to door asking for them or something?  When he realized that I had no idea what was going on, he hurriedly elaborated.

Students take them to go sledding, he said.  On the hill at the far end of the campus parking lot.  The hill that’s rumored to be merely a covered garbage heap because this part of the US doesn’t have hills.

Apparently it’s a *thing* around here. Students steal the trays and slide down the hill on them.  They only get brought back about a third of the time.

“But there’s no snow out right now!” you’re surely thinking.  “There will never be snow again because global warming is going to kill us all!”

Correct.

But do you really need snow when you’ve got mud?  With as much as it rains around here, we’ve got plenty of mud.

“You want me to hike out to the far end of campus, where it’s remote and isolated, and demand a group of students give us back our trays?” I asked.

“Exactly!” he said.  “And bring back any discarded ones you find out there.

So he’s trying to get me killed I guess.  But to give him the benefit of the doubt, I asked why he was sending me, of all people.  He looked confused for a moment and said I was the most obvious choice.  He knew I could handle it.  Then I noticed that my coworkers were giving me the thumbs-up and I stg one of them mouthed “go get ‘em Ashley!” at me, like I’m a dog they’re siccing on some hapless squirrels.  It seemed that everyone agreed that I was best suited for the manager’s search and ~~destroy~~ retrieve mission.

Am I intimidating or something?  I don’t feel that way.  I certainly don’t look like it.  Maybe I’ve dealt with enough inhuman bullshit by now that I’ve developed a “don’t mess with me” aura?  Or perhaps it’s the trauma.  Let’s be real - I’ve seen some shit and I can say that unironically.  Perhaps that has actually made me a little immune to getting worked up over regular old nonsense.

Also it *was* broad daylight so a walk over to the edge of the parking lot wasn’t that big of an ask.

There were six people at the hill when I arrived.  They’d clearly been sledding, as evidenced by the mud covering the bottoms of their trays and the jeans of one hapless person that had clearly wiped out once already.  I’m not sure what the appeal of sliding down a muddy hill on a plastic tray was, but maybe it’s just one of those weird local traditions that I missed out on because I’m not that social of a person.  Cassie probably heard about it.  This just isn’t the sort of thing she’d want to do.

Strangely, I didn’t see any trays strewn about the bottom of the hill.  My manager was going to be disappointed.  He’s been grumbling for weeks now about having to reorder a bunch of food after the last time he went all Pacman on it.  He’s not going to be happy about having to order new trays on top of it.  I resolved to get the six trays the students had with them back at the very least.

I waved at them as I approached.  I’d left my work apron behind, so there was no way to tell I was there on behalf of Official Dining Hall business.  They waved back but otherwise seemed prepared to ignore me.  I stopped at the base of the hill. It’s definitely a man-made hill.  It’s maybe the size of a two-story house with steep sides, like a pimple on the landscape.

“I need the trays,” I said.  “The dining hall wants them back.”

The group paused and stared at me in unison.  The atmosphere shifted, turning both awkward and hostile.  Mostly awkward, though.

“No,” one of them finally said.  A girl in the back giggled.

“Yes,” I replied.

And then we just stared at each other in this weird sort of stand-off, where they weren’t quite sure if they should resume what they were doing, both because I was acting like I had authority to tell them not to and also probably because I’d chosen to stand at the base of where they’d been sliding, judging by the trail of mud at my feet.

Maybe my manager didn’t send me here because I’m intimidating.  Maybe he sent me here because he knew I’d make this so uncomfortable that they’d give up and leave me the trays.

“This is stupid,” the girl in the back huffed.  “Get out of the way.”

She set the tray on the ground at the top of the hill.  Got on it.  I braced myself.  Fine.  She could run into me.  I might not be that strong, but I felt my odds of knocking her off that stupid tray and into the mud when she reached me were pretty good.  Then she shoved off, her friends stepped aside to let her glide past, and the hill opened up around her.

Like a mouth.  It split in two, a gaping chasm from one side of the hill to the other with jagged teeth made out of the splintered remains of the missing cafeteria trays.  A rank smell emanated from its depths, a stench like rotting meat and spoiled milk.  I almost gagged.

She slid straight into it.

The other students around here were losing their footing as the hill split open, falling over and rolling or sliding down its side.  I distantly heard their panicked shouts, as if I were listening to them from underwater.  My gaze was fixed on the girl just ahead of me on the hillside, watching her body tumble down into the hill, her fall arrested as she latched both hands onto one of the hill’s teeth.

Her eyes met mine.  I saw the confused terror in them.  It had happened so fast, the hill opening up beneath her, but I still saw the realization in her face.

She knew she was about to die.  She didn’t know why or how, but she knew that something horrible was happening to her.

And I think that was what broke me out of my trance.  That moment of human contact, when our eyes locked.  The hill was moving about, the earth rippling, like it was trying to swallow, trying to shake her off its lip and into the darkness of its throat.  But that upper jaw was closing, the gaping chasm that was its mouth inexorably closing around her.

I lunged forward, digging my feet into the muddy hillside.  She stretched out a hand for me, the other still clinging desperately to the jagged tooth.  I grabbed hold, her muddy fingers slipping with mine, and then I latched my other hand around her wrist to stabilize my grip.

I pulled.  My feet began to slide in the mud.  We were going forward, not backwards, towards the depths of the creature’s mouth.

Then a pair of arms wrapped around my waist.  I heard yelling but in my panic I couldn’t discern the words.  I stopped sliding on the mud and then I felt a tug, I was moving backwards, and I was dragging the girl with me.

We almost had her free.  We were so close.

And then the hill slammed its mouth shut.

I didn’t let go.  The people anchoring me didn’t let go.  She screamed and screamed and went limp in my grasp but we didn’t let go.  We kept pulling and then with a wet sucking sound, we ripped her free of the hillside.

I fell over backwards and tumbled down to the base of the hill.  Then I lay there, stunned, listening to the chaos around me.  Someone was crying.  Someone else was screaming.  And someone, thank goodness, had the presence of mind to call 911.

I’d managed to collect my wits by the time the ambulance arrived.  The girl was alive.  We’d pulled her out in time.  She even still had both of her legs.  Granted, they were both *broken*, but they were still attached to her body.  Two *very* broken legs are awful, but it was still a lot better than it could have been.  She didn’t make a sound while the paramedics were loading her up but I suspect that was more from shock than relief to be alive.  *I’m* relieved she’s alive.  So was everyone else that had helped pull her out.

I walked with them back towards campus with the stolen cafeteria trays tucked under one arm.  They were frantically discussing what the heck they were going to do about this.  The hill had tried to *eat her*.  They all saw it.  Did they go to campus security?  The police?  Should they keep quiet because surely no one was going to believe them?

I was about to speak up when one of them threw up his hands, declared that this was all insane and he was going back to his dorm, and walked off.  No one went after him.  I watched him go while the remainder started discussing what they should do about the hill.  When he passed the corner of a building, something detached itself from the wall and began to walk behind him.  Something with skin patterned like bricks and with long fingers that dangled all the way down to its bony knees.

I felt a knot in my throat.  If I ran - if I caught up enough to at least yell at him -

I did nothing.  I stood there and watched until they were both out of sight.  And then I too walked off, leaving the remaining students behind to figure this out on their own.  It wouldn’t matter, whatever they decided.  The college would make sure they forgot about it and they’d think their friend broke her legs in some stupid, ordinary, accident.

I can’t protect them.  And even if they knew, they couldn’t protect themselves.  They have to sleep at some point and the Forgetter can get into their dorm rooms.

Maybe it’s for the best.  Knowing about the inhuman around here certainly hasn’t made my life - or anyone else’s - better.  Maybe the Forgetter is here to protect the students as much as the college itself.  If they forget and go on with their lives, then maybe the inhuman won’t distinguish them from any other student on campus.  They have the list of rules but they don’t have to believe it, not until they *need* to.  And after that?  Once they forget and return to boring normalcy?

Then maybe they won’t continue to be magnets for the inhuman.  Like I am.  Like Cassie and Maria and now the Folklore Society.

I wonder if that is what the flickering man meant, when he said he’d seen people like me before and that there would be more like me after I was gone.  Are we the lightning rods?  The sacrifices to keep the inhumans sated and away from the bulk of the student body?  Is this why the campus resurrected the Folklore Society after it was on the verge of disbanding?

So many questions and I know everyone is going to say who I should talk to about them.  Good news: I did talk to Grayson.  When I saw the Forgetter slink off I knew its hands would be busy with quite a few people.  That meant I had a window of opportunity in which to talk to Grayson and to remember what was said.

I called him and asked if he could meet me somewhere on campus.  He readily agreed.  Since it was somewhat nice out (and by that I mean not raining) we found a bench to sit on outdoors.  I took a deep breath, reminded myself that we were friends and friends were honest and just wanted the best for each other.  We weren’t dating.  I didn’t have to be the perfect girlfriend anymore.

“Your dad isn’t alive, is he?” I asked.

And I told him that I stopped by his house and got sucked into this awful situation where I was mistaken for him and didn’t know how to extricate myself.  I admit that I cried a bit.  I do feel guilty about it.  Really guilty.  But Grayson just sighed and ran his hands through his hair.  He didn’t seem angry about it.  He seemed… frustrated.

“It’s fine,” he said when I finished.  “You’re not telling me anything I don’t already know.”

“Then - you knew he was dead all along?” I ventured.

“I’m not sure dead is quite the right term.  I mean… he’s there, isn’t he?  His mind or soul or whatever it is.”

I was quiet for a moment.  Undead, then?  Or alive and rotting? Did semantics *really* matter?

“This is why his memory is going,” I said quietly.  “Isn’t it?”

“It is.  At some point he’ll be so rotten he can’t function anymore.  Then they’ll want a new president.  They’ll demand one.”

“You?” I asked, almost breathless.

Grayson laughed softly, bitterly.  His hands were clasped together in his lap.  His knuckles were white.

“No, I’ve managed to avoid taking that role.  They’ve always found someone else and just slid him into that position like nothing changed.”

“Is your dad…” I whispered, not wanting to say it, unable to stop myself, “...not your first dad?”

“I’ve lost track of how many there have been,” he replied.

“So what, they just - give you a new dad when the old one falls apart?  Not even a real dad but a - a *corpse?*”

I was starting to get angry at this point.  Appalled, yes, but also very very angry.  I mean, my dad was gone.  He died.  And if someone tried to slip in a replacement - not even a person, but a rotting animated corpse! - I don’t know if I could sit there and handle it as quietly as Grayson was.  How was he not spending every waking moment consumed with anger?  How has he not burned this fucking place to the ground already?

“I don’t think it’s really for *me*,” he said thoughtfully.  “It’s more that the university needs a president.  I just happen to be part of the package.”

Somehow that made it even worse.

“How long has this been going on?”

“As early as I remember.  There was…”

He raised his head and stared hollowly into the sky.  His gaze was distant and unfocused.  Then he took a deep breath and shook himself.

“It’s the tree,” he sighed.  “The tree is why they don’t last.”

The roots.  They were everywhere now.

“Is it… why you look so tired now?” I asked.

He nodded, turning his head sideways and giving me a sad smile.

“I’m sorry.  This is a lot to burden you with.  It’s okay though.  This is my last year here.”

“I hate this place,” I said.  “I wish I’d never come here.”

“Hey.  Don’t say that.”

He turned towards me and grabbed my hands.

“Listen.  You wanted to leave your hometown, right?  That’s why you’re here.  Don’t lose sight of that - you came here because you wanted to do something *different* with your life - and you are!  You left!  You changed your life!  That’s what I love about you.  And I’m going to leave too - I have a plan, don’t worry - and it’ll all be better.”

I wish I could believe that.  I really do.  But I do feel this - maybe I can trust Grayson or maybe I can’t, but he needs to get out of this place.  Leave, like I did.  I see myself in him, trapped by the expectations of everyone around him, caged in by how things should be because that’s how they’ve always been.

It’s wrong.  It’s why this whole damn campus feels like it's rotting at the core.  But we’re both going to graduate and then we’re going to leave and we’ll never [come](https://alderrayne.com/) [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
