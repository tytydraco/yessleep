It was a sweltering summer, over a decade ago, just after our freshman year of high school. We were a tight-knit group of friends, excited about continuing this chapter of our lives together. But one among us was the quiet loner, always on the outskirts of our laughter and secrets. His name was Alex, he had just moved to our town a year ago to start high school with the rest of us. He never quite fit in, and we could see the uncertainty in his eyes. Determined to make him feel welcome into our circle, we tried to include him in our summer activities.

  
One fateful night, our youthful recklessness led us to explore the abandoned Mansion at the edge of town. We were curious and fearless, believing ourselves invincible. Alex hesitated, warning us about the rumors the townspeople spoke of the mansion being haunted. But we teased him, dismissing his fears as irrational ramblings of the town’s elders to scare off new residents.

  
Inside the decrepit house, the atmosphere was eerie, and a sense of uneasiness settled upon us. Creaking floorboards and distant whispers played tricks on our minds. The darkness seemed to have a life of its own, closing in around us as we ventured deeper.

  
As we roamed through the halls of the old mansion, Alex's uneasiness was palpable. The unsettling stories about the place had gotten under his skin, and he decided to step outside, seeking a moment of respite from the suffocating atmosphere. This gave us the perfect opportunity to set our plan in motion. We decided to play a cruel prank on Alex, a twisted way of making him feel included and forcing him to confront his fears. We concocted a plan to make Alex believe the mansion was truly haunted.

  
As he stood alone in the moonlit courtyard, Alex’s fear of being left by himself overpowered him. His fear of being alone outweighed his uneasiness about the mansion, and he mustered the courage to go back inside.

  
As he called out to us in distress, we pretended to have left him alone in the darkness. My heart pounded with excitement as I took on the role of the "mansion's ghost," draping an old sheet over myself. The others in the group played sound effects on their phones, creating eerie noises that echoed through the halls. Some of them took it further, banging on the walls and sprinting around the other floors of the mansion, their footsteps adding to the sense of chaos and fear. All the while, Alex's heart raced, and his senses were overwhelmed by the terrifying prank we had orchestrated. As he searched for us, I moved stealthily through the shadows, making sure he caught fleeting glimpses of the ghostly figure in the corner of his eye.

  
As I ran around the house, keeping just out of his reach, Alex's fear escalated, and his desperate calls for us intensified. Our prank was in full swing, and the adrenaline surged through my veins, making the thrill of the scare almost intoxicating. But then, in a moment of panicked realization, Alex caught sight of me directly, so I began to chase him. His eyes widened with terror, he bolted, trying to escape the clutches of the haunted specter pursuing him.

  
With fear blurring Alex’s vision he unknowingly ran directly over some rotten floorboards. The wooden surface gave way beneath him, and he fell, hitting his head on the exposed cement of the basement below. Panic engulfed me as I rushed to his side, my heart sinking with guilt and dread at the unintended consequence of our haunted prank. We all scrambled to try and get Alex the help he needed. But now, it was too late.

  
We all gathered around his lifeless body. We never meant for things to go this far; it was just meant to be a harmless prank. As the truth of what had happened sank in, guilt washed over us like a tidal wave, threatening to drown us all. The laughter and thrill of our mischievous prank had vanished, replaced with the haunting reality of our actions.

  
After that fateful night, we made a pact to keep it a secret, vowing never to speak of what had transpired in the old mansion. Throughout the remaining years of high school, we would see each other in the halls, and the memory of that night would linger like a haunting specter. The weight of our terrible secret strained our once close-knit friendship, causing it to slowly dissolve. Paranoia crept into my every thought, and I found it hard to trust anyone, not even my closest friends. The uneasiness gnawed at my sanity, haunting my dreams and waking hours alike. The guilt and fear never truly left us, a constant reminder of the irreversible tragedy we had caused that summer.

  
…..

  
The years passed like a haze, and we thought we had left our haunting past behind. I convinced myself that the secret was buried, never to resurface. But just when I thought the past was finally behind us, the old house, the witness to our dark secret, was scheduled for demolition, making way for a new apartment complex. 

  
The news of its destruction brought a mixture of relief and anxiety. Perhaps we would finally be free from the burden of our past. Perhaps the ghost of our past would refuse to be silenced.   
As the bulldozers tore through the dilapidated walls, the remnants of our youthful indiscretion were unearthed. A construction worker stumbled upon a shallow grave in the same courtyard Alex had looked over seeking solace, revealing his bones beneath the rubble.

  
The police were called, and the once-forgotten missing persons case resurfaced with a vengeance. My nightmares returned with renewed intensity, replaying the events of that cursed night. I couldn't escape the feeling that someone was watching me, that the walls were closing in once more.

  
As the investigation progressed, my old group of friends reunited, one by one, under a cloud of paranoia. We all tried to maintain our composure, but the weight of guilt pressed heavily on our shoulders. We had all played a part in the tragedy that had befallen Alex. Each one of us pointed fingers at the others, desperate to save ourselves from the inevitable consequences. 

  
The media caught wind of the sensational story, and the entire town buzzed with rumors and whispers. Every face seemed to carry judgment, and I felt like an animal trapped in a cage. The guilt gnawed at me day and night, and I couldn't find peace in anything anymore. The past had wrapped its cold fingers around my throat, choking the life out of me. I couldn’t take it anymore.

  
When the detectives came knocking at my door to ask the same questions from over a decade ago, I caved. Unable to bear the weight of my conscience any longer, I made a desperate decision to tell the truth. I admitted to the accidental death in the old mansion that summer. I hoped that by confessing, I could finally find some semblance of redemption and give closure to Alex's family, even if it meant facing the harsh consequences of our youthful recklessness. The burden of our secret had haunted me for far too long, and it was time to face the truth and the fallout that came with it.

  
Despite the gravity of our actions, the law treated us with a leniency we didn't expect. As minors at the time of the tragic accident, the legal system recognized that our intentions were never to cause harm to Alex. The court acknowledged that it was an unfortunate incident that spiraled out of control due to youthful impulsivity and poor judgment. We received a slap on the wrist, and the consequences of our actions were minimal. Though relieved by the leniency, a sense of unease lingered within us, knowing that the true weight of our guilt would be carried with us for the rest of our lives.

  
…..

  
The apartment complex that now stood on the site of the old mansion is a constant reminder of the tragedy we had caused. But as I pass by the building these days, I can't help but notice the looks etched on the faces of its new residents. 

  
Whispers of strange occurrences circulate among them, eerie sounds echoing through the ventilation, the pattering of sprinting footsteps through the halls, doors opening and closing on their own, flickering lights that defy explanation, and something banging on the walls at night. Some have even claimed to catch fleeting glimpses of a figure, a shadowy presence that vanishes into thin air. 

  
I can't help but wonder if Alex's spirit, restless and vengeful, now haunts the very place the townspeople spoke so ominously of all those years ago. The walls that were once witnesses to our dark secret might now hold the specter of the friend we betrayed, seeking his own justice from beyond the grave.
