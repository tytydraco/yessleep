*Translator notes: In Japan, it is very normal for children to walk home from a very young age. Japan is considered a very safe country to live in and therefore parents let children walk freely from place to place.*

Police were sent out towards the area where the girl was last seen and conducted a search of the surrounding areas. They were able to recover a white shoe that matched the shoe size of Kanno Mizuki. However, they were unable to find any other sign of the girl in the area or which direction she might have gone. Patrols have been deployed along Nat'l Rte 139.

March 3, 2007, 7:01 p.m. Two children coming back from an after-school program at Narusawa Elementary School were found passed out near Narusawa Post Office.

March 4, 2007, 8:22 a.m. More reports of pets going missing by residents in and around the Kawaguchiko area. A separate investigation has been launched in order to locate the animals.

The local neighborhood association in a joint effort with Kanno’s parents have launched a campaign for locating Kanno's whereabouts.

*Translator Notes: Aokigahara Forest, also known as the Sea of Trees or the Suicide Forest, is a dense, 35-square-kilometer forest located at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan. The forest is known for its dense vegetation and the many natural caves that are formed by the lava flow from Mount Fuji. The forest has gained a reputation for being a site of frequent suicides, making it a subject of controversy and intrigue.* 

March 5, 2007, 6:19 p.m. A teenage boy working at the 森の駅 風穴 (Wind Cave Shop), a souvenir store, broke out into a psychotic episode after apparently hearing the sound of a bell. He was later admitted into a psychiatric care facility in Kawaguchiko. 

March 5, 2007, 7:40 p.m. A couple hiking the nearby tokai nature trail reported seeing a girl matching Kanno's description near the entrance of the Aokigahara Forest. They claimed that she was walking off the path and deeper into the forest. The man tried to approach her, but a very heavy fog suddenly set in which obstructed his vision and he lost sight of her.

A search and rescue party was formed immediately to search for Kanno. Authorities combed through the forest for days, but they were unable to locate her. The tracking dogs were surprisingly not able to pick up on any scent from her shoe, not only that, but they refused to enter the forest altogether. The dense undergrowth and rugged terrain made the search difficult, and the heavy fog that had descended on the forest only added to the challenge. 

March 10, 2007, 12:31 p.m. A school teacher and seven children were on a class field trip to  Aokigahara forest. They were hiking on a trail 3.2 km southwest of tokai nature trail. The teacher reported seeing the corpses of many small domestic animals as well as birds around the area. All seven of the children claimed they could hear the distinct sound of a chiming bell coming from the forest while the teacher could not.

January 7, 2023, 10:22 a.m. A second shoe, articles of clothing, and several of Kano Mizuki’s belongings have washed up in a sewage ditch in Shizuoka.

*Translator notes: Despite the ongoing search efforts, Kanno was never found, and her disappearance remains a mystery to this day. Unfortunately, she has not been the first child to have gone missing. From the 1950s over 40 children have disappeared from towns, cities, and even prefectures surrounding Aokigahara forest .The rugged terrain and dense undergrowth make it a difficult place to navigate, and it is easy to become disoriented or lost. The forest is also known for its eerily quiet atmosphere.*

*People love to gossip, so it’s important to be rational and stay close to the facts of the case, but locals in the area are starting to speculate.*
