So I live in a really old Victorian style house and sometimes the house makes weird noises. So I heard a weird noise above me so I went to check the crawl space. Now my house tends to smell... weird on occasion and there's nothing we can do so we just burn some candles. Now when I went to the crawl space it got even stronger. I felt like I was gonna vomit. It smelled like something had died up there. I get up in the crawl space with the flash on my phone. I started crawling around when it got really strong and I felt something squishy. I looked down and it was the most disturbing or maybe disgusting thing I have ever seen.

It was a human head that looked like it had been there for decades. I screamed and started back tracking and fell through the crawl space since it's not that strong and decades old. I couldn't scream. I was choked up. It's been a month and it still smells weird. At least I fell into a closet no one uses. I'm never going up there again or questioning that damn smell again.I still can't understand how something like that could ever happen. But the thing that I still question, the thing that shakes me to the core is why and how did this happen? 

I'm too scared to call the police because they might suspect me. But how did the head get up there? It's impossible!! The boards are too weak and you have to go up a ladder and go through this kinda shaft thing that leads to the crawl space and the roof. How could someone carry up anything even slightly heavy up there? I don't understand. I can still smell it but I'm not going back up there. The worst part is I don't live alone so it's not like no one's ever gonna go in there.

The only logical thing I can think of is that someone either got stuck up there and died with their body somehow being severed from their body or they were murdered,dismembered, and their head was put in the crawl space even if those are logical they still would not make sense at all. I can't sleep or even think because of this. I'm afraid to have anyone because they might question the smell and I don't want anything bad happening. I just don't understand how this is possible? I'm planning on just asking my roommate and life long friend if we could just pack up and leave but they love the house a lot and don't wanna leave.But I don't know what to tell her or how to tell her that I found a literal body in the crawl space that was probably older than us. I don't even have the strength to think about this any longer, every time I think of this subject I get a migraine and wanna throw up all over my room. Please DM me if anyone has any advice. To answer someone's question I posted here because it's anonymous and I think I'll be safe enough to not get police sent to my home.
