We should never have entered the catacombs beneath Paris. The air was thick with the scent of decay, and the narrow stone corridors echoed with the drip, drip, drip of ancient water. But curiosity has a way of leading fools to their doom, doesn't it?

I still remember the moment the dust stirred as we uncovered the spores, an undulating cloud of ancient mold that had waited millennia for fresh lungs. It was Bastien who coughed first, a dry, hacking sound that bounced eerily off the walls. Then, one by one, we all followed, gasping, choking, unable to stop the invisible tendrils from winding their way into our systems.

At first, it was the memories. They slipped into my mind so gently that I mistook them for my own. I remembered places I'd never been, saw through eyes that weren't mine. I was inside my friends' minds, experiencing their joys, their fears, the intimate moments of their lives. The shock was gut-wrenching.

Then came the pain. It wasn't mine—no, it was Élodie's. Her migraine, a crushing vice around the skull, shared generously among us. It was then we realized what had happened; the spores had bound us together, not just in memory, but in body and soul.

The escape from those cursed tunnels was a nightmare. Every scrape and fall was felt by all. When Tom twisted his ankle, the shared agony almost brought us to our knees. But the worst was the fear, multiplied by four, a looping feedback that grew with each shadow and echo in that godforsaken labyrinth.

Getting out into the open air didn't help as we'd hoped. The connection didn't fade as we'd prayed it would. Instead, it solidified, deepened. We became unable to function alone. We moved together, ate together, slept together. Individuality was slipping away, a sandcastle at high tide.

Then, the thoughts weren't just shared; they were merged, a cacophony of voices in a single choir, growing louder, drowning out who we used to be. I could feel myself fading, becoming just another voice in the chorus, fighting to remember my own name.

The breaking point came when we couldn't stand the sound of our own thoughts. It was Mark who suggested it first, a dark whisper in the back of our minds. If one of us ended it, would the connection break? Would the rest regain their solitude? We pondered, hesitated, then silently agreed. But who would make the sacrifice? Who could?

We drew straws, a barbaric lottery for such a modern curse. It was Inès who drew the short one. The decision made, the act was swift, a tragic finale on a moonless night by the river's edge.

But the release didn't come. Instead, her final scream, her ultimate fear, echoed endlessly in our minds, a loop that wouldn't cease. It was then we understood—the hive didn't diminish; it grew hungry.

Now, we avoid each other, desperate not to add more to the collective, to the echoing us. But solitude is a lie, for even as I write this, I can feel them, hear them, inside my head. They’re waiting, always waiting, for the echoes to consume [us](https://new.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1d3diim/a_killer_gave_us_a_list_of_instructions_we_had_to/) [all](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/).
