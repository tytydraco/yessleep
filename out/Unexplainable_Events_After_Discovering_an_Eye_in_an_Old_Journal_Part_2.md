It has only been 24 hours since the last post and I can’t help but notice things around here have gotten way worse beyond comprehension. I think posting my thread yesterday was a terrible idea as it seems like the entity got even stronger. To make matters worse I had some users reach out to me saying they too are now experiencing creepy things in their homes and feel they are being watched. I am beginning to wonder if the fuel for this entity is thought itself, not the journal or even the picture of the eye. I made a huge mistake talking about it yesterday, but I am desperate to get any help on this. I’m scared to go silent as this will just let whatever entity I’m dealing with win and succeed with whatever it's aiming for. Let me tell you a terrifying thing I witnessed earlier in the night at 3 am.

  
I awoke to the smell of fire and brimstone and what sounded like thousands of souls screaming at once in agony. I was too scared to leave my bed, I could hear the sounds of what sounded like sawing and people being beaten alive and tortured. I couldn’t take it anymore and tried to hide under my blanket but that only made things worse as it seemed as I more I tried to protect myself from what is happening the more sinister and twisted the punishment got for the damned souls. I could hear the many cries of people ranging from adults to young children. I felt like my heart was going to break as I was not able to withstand the guilt as I witnessed this horrific mess from the small confinements of my own bed.

  
I finally couldn’t take it anymore; I darted up from my bed and followed to where the screams and torment was coming from and it was happening in what was once my small bedroom when I was a child that is used for an office now. I was hesitant but when I entered the room the screams suddenly just stopped as if nothing was happening. Suddenly…the door slammed shut in front of me. I attempt to try and open the door but by doing soon I felt my hand burn when I touch the door knob…As I placed my back against the wall in fear what was happening next, I could hear the sound of something outside flying around before there was a large crashing sound off in the distance along with what sounded like an animal screaming in agony of some sort. I felt myself beginning to feel extremely weak and slide onto the floor losing consciousness into a deep terrifying slumber.

  
In my dream I found myself it what appeared to be a hellish environment, the sky was painted blood red the ground covered in decaying ashes and dust and like before the sounds of screaming souls in agony off in the distance. I feel like this was a scene out of Dante’s Inferno as the thing I’ve witnessed in this dimension is beyond anything that would be allowed to ever be discussed to another person. I felt sick to my stomach as I watched in horror what was happening before me.

  
I wandered through a dark labyrinth of some sort that was covered in fog from the distant burning flesh and was as if it was a large forest made of burning obsidian, I found myself getting lost repeatedly and desperate to escape. To make matters worse I wasn’t the only person or being in this hellish maze…I could hear the sounds of souls struggling to find their way through the walls. As I walked around the obsidian forest, I was also barefoot and could feel the obsidian shards piercing into my flesh with each step bringing me pain as misery and it got worse the further I walked along.

  
Finally, when I thought all hope was lost I saw what appeared to be a small blue flame flying around in circles in the air as if it was gesturing me to follow it. Staring at the blue light provided me some slight form of comfort and I was desperate for any chance I had of getting out of this hell. I followed the blue light and could hear a soft voice that could speak in a different tongue I was able to understand only for the moment that said, “Follow me, and only me, do not whatsoever take your eyes off me, look at me, don’t look away no matter what.”

  
What came next made that absolutely unbearable and difficult to follow but I managed. I focused my gaze only on the flame and trusted it to guide us in the right direction, from what I was able to see in my peripheral vision we were nearing a river of some sort with more souls being tortured in anguish, most of them screamed in agony while some of them tried to distract me to look at them to see what was happening. The beasts that were punishing them too were trying to get me to look at them and make loud sounds for me to turn, but in tears I focused my gaze only at the blue light as I continued to step through the bladed floors of obsidian before we reached what was a large gate that slowly opened into an abyss before me. As I walked into the darkness, I could feel myself slowly starting to awake in the real world, but before so I heard the blue wisp like light speak once more, in a foreign tongue “This was just the first circle.”

  
I awoke in my childhood bedroom out of breath and covered in sweat. I went to my Mom and told her everything that happened and she is suggesting we reach out to more relatives or family back home in the Philippines that might be able to help us. In the meantime, my Mom has tried burning sage which seems to struggle with staying lit but still burns as long as your consistent with relighting the flame. My Mom left a voicemail on my Uncle Edwin’s phone asking for help and if he knew about the journal and photo. As I said previously this journal and photo originally came from my late Aunt, but I should’ve expanded on that more. My Aunt Rosita isn’t around anymore but her husband Edwin is. I don’t really know much about him other than the stories how my Mom and him used to fight a lot when they were younger back in the day as children.

  
As for my friend with OCD I want to keep anonymous to protect his identity as much as possible, has checked himself into a mental facility. From what I gathered from his parents, he became so obsessed with the photo of the eye and wouldn’t stop drawing it in his room leading to him eventually having a meltdown and had to seek help.

  
The rest of my friends are still complaining of things progressively getting worse in their homes as well and now I have some reddit users saying they are experiencing paranormal activity in their home after reading my story. First, I am sorry for spreading this onto you, but I don’t know where else to go or what to do. I feel like silence is not the answer here as there has to be a way to defeat this thing.

  
I will provide another update when I can and hopefully, I will have more information on how this thing can be stopped and those that affected have their lives return to normal. Please if you know any information on this creature, please let me know or anything that can help us. I don’t know where else to turn.
