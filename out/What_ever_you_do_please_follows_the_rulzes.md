I'm writing to warn about the dangers of not following the rules on r/no sleep.
To give the context about my pediciment I didnt follows the rules and now in paying the price.

It all started when decided to create an account for my favourite subreddit you can guess what it is. I digress after creating my account and joing r/no sleep I was sent a message explaing the rules. I've read stories of people not following rules and and suffering but I knew that that was all hogwash. 

I read them and saw that they where all pretty standard rules of following there guidelines until I saw rule 13. 

Rule 13 stated as follow all accounts on these Reddit must be factual and not be made up. Not admiring to this rule will result In suspension of your account untill proven true.

I read that rule over and over again thinking to myself what bullshit there's no way they can tell in all of gods given earth they can find out that it was true or not. The only scary t hi in is when the moderator finds out that your story has been copied or pastest from the internet or you haven't gave them a warning of fixing up the story.

After finishing up my story about I survived a demon and wendigo attack I posted my story thinking I should be able to get a few karma. Part way of my shutting down my computer dinged. Surprised on how quick the moderator responded to my post but something was off.
I clicked on to the message and the following goses

Dear Redditor Danny4556 or dan
We have read your story and came to the conclusion that you haven't followed the rules and deem untill proven true we will be suspending your account untill further notice.

Good luck dan

What the hell that was more first post they can't just suspend my account. But what grabbed my attention was the good luck.
What the hell dose that mean those three words spooked me the most than it should have.  

Looking over I saw the time and it was just 110pm. I signed and logged off for the night when I heard three loud knocks coming from my bedroom. Being very paranoid of people and what they think of me I live on the outskirts of town where very few people live. So hearing to here loud knocks from my bedroom sent my anxiety thought the roof. I quickly bolted for the but the moment I opened a massive beast with deer antlers and rotten flesh assaulted my senses the sight was truely horrendous.

I slammed the door before the dressed beast could even belch it's horrible sound. I hurtled on to the floor from the smell.

Oh god that smell was so hurrendous I couldn't stop gagging for a minute stiaght.
I looked up to hear the sound of metal scraping on wood. The cabin felt as if it got a lot hotter.i started to sweat profusely untill my eyes caught on to a beautiful naked women with fire red hair. She looked at me and gave a menacing grin.

Shit I thought myself a fuckeng demon I quickly ran to the kitchen to grab some kind you she wasn't moving face. Only to taunt me.
I sprayed the water all over but that only pissed her off. She learched up ready to swing he mighty sword at me I barely missed me and left a blazing scroch mark across my ribs. That stung like hell litterly as I felt the entire of hellss victims flood my mind from that one single slash.

I realed back in pain and anguish trying to not let the screams of hell in side my head get to me. I looked up and saw that she had stoped and was smiling at me. Her evil grin was telling me something.

"Fuck the wendigo"
 I completely forgot I was facing not one but two monsters. Suddenly I felt a sharp pain across my back as three massive claws ripped through the window. Barely anytime to think and loosing blood I ran up to my room forgetting about the knocks I heard. 

Slamming the door behind me I ripped some of my shirt to make a make shift bandaid for my wound. I looked around my bedroom to see my computer on my bed how it got sent waves of anger and fear down me. The I rembered the post on I made the a science of pure dread come over meig this is happening that means all other accounts are true or have been made true by these moderator why tho.

"Shit"
I rembered that if all this is happening that means that the next part means that one I look und the bed hands would grab and throw me to the wall. I held my computer tightly and looked under the bed. Immedly dark charcoal hand grabbed me and through me against the wall. With my computer thrown away against me I crawled towards looked at my computer and saw the final message on my laptop
