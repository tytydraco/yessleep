I swear to shit, I’m about to lose it. This keeps happening and I’m over it.

  
My rugrat, he’s got this “gift”, right. If that’s what you want to call it. I call it a fucking nightmare.

  
He’s 15. He was always a really sweet kid, well-mannered, kind, the kind of kid who ran ahead so he could be the one to hold the door for people. He was 5 when he started doing that, and when we asked him where he learned that holding the door was polite, he said he didn’t. He just thought it was nice to do, so he did it. Sweet, right?

  
But now, he’s 15. His room smells like an asshole full of locker rooms, everytime me or his mom tries to talk to him – about anything, just a normal conversation about his interests or his friends – it’s like he’s talking with a mouth full of broken glass. He doesn’t usually say anything wrong exactly, but everything he says sounds wrong. 

  
Anyway, that’s not really the point. The point is he’s always had this gift with animals. His mom and I noticed it the first time when he was two years old. His older sister wanted a bunny and she grinded on it for two years. We looked into it and realized how much work and how destructive they can be, so we kept saying no. We got books that explained all the responsibilities and she just would not give it up. 

  
Eventually, we caved in and agreed to get a bunny. She’s a good kid and she was responsible even back then, so we went to the big box pet store to pick out a bunny and a starter habitat for Alisha. Aaron usually passed out in his stroller with his head at an awkward side angle and milk dribbling out of the corner of his mouth. Today was routine.

  
I’ve always liked fish and I’ve had several different aquariums, so my wife Sarah took Alisha to see about the bunnies, and Aaron rolled around with me while I toyed with the idea of a new tank.

  
About the time I stopped in front of the wall of tanks, Aaron woke up, so I kicked back the stroller hood to let him see and we browsed the fish. That was the first time I saw it happen, and let me tell you, it is a very strange sight seeing all those fish schooled up like that, tank by tank, looking at you. Pointed at you.  


  
I just thought it was some odd phenomenon at first until Aaron and I rolled a little further, and the fish filled along, watching like…well…I can’t really compare it to anything. It’s that fucking weird.  
Anyway, after doing a few (not scientific) tests with the fish, myself, and Aaron in the stroller, I figured out it was my son.That test was really only me rolling the stroller away from me, followed by removing Aaron from the stroller. It wasn’t the stroller, it wasn’t me, and that left only him. I told Sara the discovery and of course she didn’t believe me. I wouldn’t have either. But I could prove it.   
She actually got annoyed and even started to get mad because she thought it was some dumb prank I just wouldn’t give up on and we both got a little loud in the store. Nothing drastic or embarrassing, just a couple firm clear voices organizing their shared nonsense in public.  
After I showed them, Alisha got so excited (she was 9 at the time) she was bouncing around, making noise, and generally drawing attention. A few minutes later, Aaron, the stroller and I had a crowd of maybe more than 20 people watching us, chuckling, and looking puzzled. Even the employees came to see.  
Hardly a circus act, I know, but not bad for a midday Saturday suburban Pet Store. Equal parts interesting and puzzling.  
As he grew up, we saw different events like that one, over and over. He was in the local paper in a photograph absolutely covered with butterflies. That photo was picked up by the USA Today and ran in the Lifestyle section.  
He learned to control it, too. Not the animals, but he learned to control his gift, so it’s not like he was swarmed by critters all the time. In fact, we hardly ever saw a bug in our house, and our neighbors have some pretty good-sized ant infestations from time to time. I’m convinced Aaron has kept them mostly out.  
Then, about six months ago Aaron mentioned during one of our rare conversations that anybody could do it. He said the animals would be scared if everyone could do it. When I asked him how long he knew he could teach other people the – he quickly corrected me that it’s not a trick – method to it, he told me he’s always known it. He doesn’t remember that first time, but he’s always known that anyone could do it. He didn’t tell anyone because he knew it would turn out bad. He didn’t have a good reason why, but got a bolt of cold steel up my back when I thought about it being common knowledge. I was glad he didn’t tell anyone. It’s hard to say, but I think most kids would have told their friends and after that, word would have gotten out.  
He offered to tell me how. My gut punch reaction was no, and I told him I was proud of him keeping it a secret. We talked more about it and by the end of our conversation, he told me how.  
I’m never telling, so don’t ask. Besides, there’s more you should know first.  
So, Aaron’s right, it is not a trick. It is not really a method even. It’s just this natural thing. I can’t safely share much more in case somebody manages to put some ideas together and they get there on their own.  
The trouble with this fucking “gift” is that it isn’t easy to control. At all. Maybe since Aaron has had it since he was two, or maybe since birth, I don’t know.  
Every time I go outside, it seems to get worse, too. It started small at first and the family of squirrels that hung around the feeder out back followed me around while I walked around to check the siding on our house. It was as cute as you can imagine. They sort of weaved and braided their way through my legs as I walked. It 100% reminded me of The Chipmunks and their guy. I was Dale. (Was Dale his name? I can’t remember.)  
The next time, it was the dogs. Luckily, they were all leashed, but what the actual dick? Now I hear the stupid jokes from the entire neighborhood about, well, you name it. “Peanut Butter, huh?” with a glance at my zipper. “Is that a milk bone in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” From across the street, “You still in heat Steve? Or is it safe for Bella to come out?”  
I know they’re only kidding, but it’s adding insult to injury at this point. Last night, I took the garbage out and I stepped on an anthill I hadn’t seen before. They didn’t attack me, but I had to walk around the block and sneak back into the house. I had to hide from a colony of ants to sneak into my own fucking house.  
So, yeah. Since I can’t control it and Aaron can’t (or won’t, we’ve gone a few rounds about it) teach me how, I get swarmed everytime I go outside. It was cute, then annoying, but it’s getting progressively worse and it happens every day now and every duck fucking time I go outside.  
Right before I decided to share my experience, on the way in the door, it was cats. And mice.   
That’s right, two different animals now and mortal enemies, no less. If it’s cats and mice today, what will tomorrow be? What if it’s humans one day?  
I’m sure it will turn out ok. I’ll keep trying to practice, to learn how Aaron does it.

It’s hard to believe it’s only been a week. So much has happened. Things are becoming dire.  
Where to start…  
I’m exhausted. Our yard looks like a zoo, I’ve spoken with 4 different law enforcement officers, Ted and I are new best friends now and hang out every day now (Ted is the Director of Animal Control in our VERY populous county.), two nights ago a group of neighbors looked like they were less than a 6-pack away from actual torches, tar, and feathers. They banged on the side of our house for several minutes until Sara went outside and reminded them that children live here. I can’t go outside. I won’t be attacked, but I will be flat out crushed by all of them. I’ve spoken with 3 attorneys this week. All three said the same thing, nearly word for word which I figure isn’t a good sign of what’s to come. In a nutshell, if I don’t get the abundance of animals off my property and out of the neighborhood, I will be facing a civil suit. At least 3 at this point, but I suspect the biggest day for lawsuits is still to come. Birds slam themselves against any window they spot me through. Aaron can’t seem to help at all, and he broke down crying last night, so I believe home wholeheartedly about controlling it.   
My life is over. Who can live like this? And even if I can, how long can I survive?  
My wife and my children are upstairs packing now. I have no choice but to stay here. If I could leave and put more distance between them and me, I would. The television crews pulled up this morning, so it’s about to become much worse and I want them safe. I’m freaking the fuck out at this point.   
I told my wife to take the kids somewhere and don’t tell me where. It’s inevitable that the government will be along and offer to assist me” which will probably involve a lot of sticky pad sensors and some needles in the brain, and honestly that is the best case that I can think of at this point.  
I can’t believe this is happening. Please, tell your friends and your family that you love them. I’m bawling right now wishing I could just spend a peaceful day with them, but it’s never going to happen again.  
I’ll try to check in if I can.  
**Jan. 27, 2024**  
This is my last correspondence I think. We’ll see what happens, I don’t know. Sara left 2, maybe 3 days ago. I’m not sure. Since the helicopters started circling, I don’t think I’ve slept and that was….2 days ago, so maybe Sara left three. I don’t know anymore.  
I’m falling apart, and I’m scared. I don’t think I’ll survive tonight. They’re finding ways inside. I’ve gone over every window, door, vent, everywhere I can think of, and tried my best to seal them with towels, blankets, sheets, tape, everything I can think of. I still keep seeing them, only the small ones, some bugs and birds, but it’s only a matter of time. Every window of the house is cracked and caked with feathers and blood. Some larger animals have been slamming into the side of the house and it’s constant now that the house shakes and booms. Just non-fucking-stop. I’ve never been so happy that we don’t have a fireplace and the idea of needles in my brain at the bottom of a hidden military complex has never sounded more like a vacation.  
I haven’t seen any black suits, but the night that Sara took the kids away, I lost power. We still had a landline (Sara liked having it in case of emergencies, and it was cheap) but that’s out. I think the sheer volume of wildlife outside was too much. Maybe too much weight on the lines, I don’t know I can’t see much between the bloody streaked, busted windows, and the crowd of animals outside. I feel like everyone had to retreat. I’m not sure if the CIA or whatever would think I’m worth  the effort.   
I know that in the next 24 hours, either the animals are going to get in, more animals will show up until their bodies start piling up, with my house at the center, until the weight is too much and it collapses. What a way to go, eh? Crushed inside your house by the dead weight of thousands of animal corpses. Awesome. And since this must be problematic for the outside world, people are looking for a solution. Not one that involves saving me, mind you, but it very well could involve napalming the entire neighborhood. I would vote yes.  
I imagine that’s the last thing they’d want. It’s the last thing I want.   
Even if I survive a while, I can feel the stress, fear, solitude, dread, and the lack of sleep doing its work. Witnessing death at a rate of nearly 2 per minute as sparrows, robins, and cardinals splatter right in front of me. The thud of bigger animals outside, and I can’t imagine a scenario that involves all that noise but no burm of dead creatures surrounding the house? No way. Not possible.  My sanity is slipping.  
There’s nothing left to say. I’ll check if I ever get a chance. I probably have one and a half charges total on my phone now. I don’t want to waste the power for a tablet or anything. I even drained both laptops, so resources are low. I hadn’t considered that until now. Perfect.  
Tell your family you love them. Tell them to beware of the “gift”. I laugh out loud everytime I write or say the word. I hear the crazy in my own voice when I do. I can’t help it.  
Maybe I’ll just keep saying it over and over until I laugh myself to death. The gift, the gift, the gift, the gift, the gift, the gift, the gift, the gift, the gift.
