If you’ve ever heard of El Salvador, you might know that it’s a place rich with legends and folklore. One of the most infamous is the tale of *The Guirola House*, an abandoned mansion in Ahuachapán. The house was once home to the wealthy Guirola family, who, according to local lore, suffered numerous tragedies within its walls. People say the mansion is cursed, haunted by the restless spirits of the family members who died there under mysterious circumstances. It's a place where the line between the living and the dead is said to blur, especially after dark.

One evening, curiosity got the best of me. I decided to see the house for myself. They say the front door is always closed, yet never locked. When I arrived, that was true. The door creaked open with little effort, as if inviting me in.

The first thing that hit me was the silence, heavy and suffocating. It was so quiet that I could hear my own breath echo in the grand entrance hall. The house was frozen in time. A table in the dining room was still set for dinner—six plates, six glasses, six neatly folded napkins. A chair at the head of the table was slightly askew, as if someone had just stood up and left in a hurry. There was a faint odor in the air, something between mildew and old wood, tinged with a scent I couldn’t quite place.

The whispers started soon after. They were faint at first, like the rustling of leaves, but they grew louder as I ventured deeper into the house. The voices were taunting, cruel. They spoke of things I had never told anyone, secrets I kept buried deep inside. *“We know you,”* they hissed. *“We see everything.”* I tried to ignore them, but the more I walked, the more insistent they became.

I found myself in a sitting room. Everything looked untouched. A child’s toy truck lay on its side on an ornate rug. A book, I think it was a bible or something like that, was splayed open on a cushioned armchair, as if someone had just set it down. A pair of reading glasses rested on top of a newspaper dated August 1923. It was as though the family had just vanished, leaving everything behind.

I ascended the grand staircase, each step creaking under my weight. At the top, a long hallway stretched out before me. Doors lined the walls on either side. The whispers turned into frantic, urgent murmurs as I passed the first door. It was slightly ajar, revealing a small room with an unmade bed, a typewriter on a desk, and a closet with clothes hanging neatly inside.

*“Don’t go further,”* the voices pleaded, but I pressed on.

At the end of the hallway stood a black door, the only one completely closed. The voices fell silent as I reached for the handle. A thick, oppressive darkness greeted me as I pushed the door open, and the silence was replaced by a low, menacing chuckle that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

I stepped into the room, and the chuckling grew louder, closer. It felt as though the darkness itself was laughing at me, mocking my every move. But I couldn’t turn back now. I was compelled to keep going, one foot in front of the other, descending the stairs that appeared in the darkness.

Each step brought me deeper into the house, deeper into whatever malevolent force resided there. The chuckling grew more intense, more maniacal, until I was sure it was right in front of me. But still, I saw nothing. Just darkness.

My hands brushed against something cold and metallic—a leaden box. The chuckling faltered for a moment as I opened it. Inside was a key, old and heavy, but somehow I knew it was important. I turned to leave, and the chuckling grew into a cacophony of laughter, echoing around me as if the house itself was in on the joke.

I bolted up the stairs, my heart in my throat. The house was alive with noise now, the voices of the damned Guirola family screaming and wailing behind every door I had passed. I raced down the hallway, slamming doors shut as I went, trying to contain whatever was trying to break free.

Finally, I made it back downstairs. The whispers returned, more aggressive and malicious than before, hurling insults and threats. I ignored them as best as I could, clutching the key like a lifeline.

I knew there was something in the kitchen I needed to see. The voices grew even more frantic as I approached the door. *“Don’t go in there,”* they begged, but I had no choice. I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The kitchen was a nightmare. The remains of the Guirola family’s last meal were still on the table, but it was the door on the far side of the room that drew me in. I opened it, revealing a set of stairs leading down to a basement. The air was colder here, and the light switch flickered as I descended.

The basement was filled with old furniture, dusty boxes, and shadows that seemed to move on their own. I could hear the family upstairs, banging on the doors I had locked, desperate to get out. I found a wall at the far end of the basement with a loose brick. Pulling it away revealed a hidden hatch. The key I found upstairs fit perfectly.

Inside the hatch was a safe. My hands shook as I dialed the combination, the date from the newspaper upstairs. The safe clicked open, revealing a briefcase. The voices upstairs were growing louder, the banging more frantic. I grabbed the briefcase and ran, not daring to look back.

I made it to the bulkhead, shoving it open with all my strength. I could feel the cold night air on my face as I stumbled out into the yard. Behind me, the house seemed to groan, the family’s anguished screams echoing in the night air. I ran as fast as I could, not stopping until the house was far behind me.

At home, I opened the briefcase. Inside was the deed to *The Guirola House*. It was old, yellowed with age, but it was what I needed. The city couldn’t demolish the house without it. I knew what I had to do—bring it to the city and have the house destroyed, to finally put the Guirola family to rest.

But as I sat there, holding the deed, a thought crossed my mind. I had left the front door unlocked. What if someone else found their way inside? What if the voices lured them in as they had lured me? The thought chilled me to the bone.

I’m not sure what I’ll do now. Maybe I’ll take the deed to the city, or maybe I’ll return to the house one last time. Either way, I can’t shake the feeling that the house isn’t done with me yet. The voices are still here, whispering in the back of my mind, waiting for me to come back.
