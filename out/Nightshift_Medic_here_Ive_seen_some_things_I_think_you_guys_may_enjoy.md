For context, I’m an EMT-B in the SouthEast US. I’ve been working private company EMS for just over a year now, doing mostly hospital to hospital calls but occasionally some 911 calls too. I’m in a more rural area, but the city is only an hour away by interstate, we go up there a lot for calls, just as much as we work in our local. I work 8pm to 8am most of the time with the same partner I’ve had for around 7 months now, sometimes there is another crew working the night at our station but it’s often just us. 

When I was in training with my company, the other crews would often joke that the station was haunted since it used to be a morgue. I thought it was just a joke to try to preen the new guys and it honestly might be. However I’ve been experiencing some weird things at the station when it’s not a busy night. Most of the time I’ll be chilling on the station couch (I’m actually on it right now writing this) watching shit on my phone or sleeping, but sometimes when I get up some things will be off, moved stuff here, a closed door that was open earlier there. You know, the usual creepy, but explainable shit you experience at night. 

One night tho, I was watching a movie with my partner on the couches when we heard some footsteps, at first we thought it may have been some background noise, but when we turned the tv down the steps were just as loud. When we started paying proper attention to it, the noises stopped. It creeped me the hell out but my partner just shrugged and put the movie back on. I could’ve sworn he was crazy because of that but when I asked him he just said , “dude this station is old as shit, it’s probably just an animal under the floors or something. I figured he was probably right since he worked here longer than me and put it out of my mind. Still weird to think about in retrospect.

Another one I can think of is when we were heading back from a psych transfer call, it was during the fall, around November, and the route back was through a bunch of backroads and was about 40 minutes from the station. I was driving while my partner slept in the other seat. It was a pretty normal drive, windy roads, the occasional car, the main struggle was just focusing on staying awake long enough to get back to the station. Occasionally we would pass deer along this route, it’s pretty normal all things considered, either individual ones or small families. Didnt think much of them other than making sure they didn’t do anything stupid like get on the road or something. I started to notice something odd though, there was more deer than usual.

Now that’s not completely abnormal, but what was weird was that there would be all on the sides of the road, either just peeking through the tree line, or on the grass. None of them moved, none of them ran like a normal animal, they just stared at us as I drove by. Began to get freaked out at this naturally and drove faster down the road, blowing through stop signs as to not stop. I’ve read enough of this subreddit to know better. As I continued down the way, more kept popping up, all just staring at us. Luckily, as I got to the station, the deer stopped showing up. I parked the ambulance, woke up my partner, and went inside, I didn’t speak a word about what happened to him. 

I got some more stories, but I just got a call and will have to end this here. Should be able to respond throughout the night if I’m lucky enough not to be swamped.
