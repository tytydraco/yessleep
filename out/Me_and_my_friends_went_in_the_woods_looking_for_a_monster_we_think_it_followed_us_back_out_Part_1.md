I am posting this because I need some answers, and I thought that you folks, especially any of you that recognize what i'm talking about, could help figure out what the fuck is happening. And yes, my friends are aware that I am posting this. Now with all that preliminary bullshit out of the way, here is what happened.  
So I live in a small town, in the rural east coast, the place is actually not that bad. the town is small, but it's not so small that everyone is probably related to each other, you know? Anyways, my friends and I met in middle school, and we all go to the same high school now, since there is only one in the entire town. one of my friends is Avery, a short blonde girl with glasses, super shy, gets straight A's but thinks she's stupid, I think you know the type. Then there's Devon, a lanky guy with long dark hair, may or may not do drugs, acts like he's the smartest when we all know his dumbass would have flunked if it weren't for Avery helping him out with work, still a pretty chill dude all in all. Lastly there is Martha, a tall redhead who's built like a lumberjack, obsessed with cars, acts like an older sister, and I'm pretty sure Avery has a crush on her. We usually hang out everyday at lunch and after school, we usually take walks in the woods behind the school, the one thing we have in common is we all appreciate nature. Speaking of, our town is surrounded by a thick, dark forest, I mean the thing is huge, and cutting right through that forest, near the town, is a river. The river is probably 40 feet wide at its widest point, and maybe like 18 feet at its deepest. Now this wasn't always a river, it used to be a small creek, and some pioneers found some gold in it and decided to set up a town along the creek. but a few miles up the creek was a huge rock cliff, above it is where the creek started. so the pioneers had the genius idea to go to the cliff and blow it the fuck up, this caused more water to flow thus turning the small creek into a big river.  
Like I said, our town is surrounded by forest, and so eventually someone will see something strange moving between the trees. This is probably how the legend of the Beast was started. Where do I even start with the Beast? The beast is our local cryptid, you could say, the beast is to my town, what the mothman is to Point pleasant, it's the best way I could describe it. He's not super popular outside of town, but he's a damn celebrity here, pretty much everyone here knows about him. We even have a souvenir shop dedicated to the Beast, since the only reason any tourists come here is either to see the Beast or if they're coming down the river. We even named our high school football team after him. The legend states that he was first sighted by some miners, after some equipment was broken and some of the miners went missing. When the other miners went searching for the lost ones, they found some strange footprints, but eventually they gave up and went home.   
Then about a few weeks later some local farmer was woken up from his nap by a loud crashing in the barn. So he got up, grabbed his shotgun, and went to the barn expecting a coyote or a burglar, but when he opened it instead and found, would you have guessed, his wife fucking the farmhand. The farmer, rightfully pissed, took some shots in the air and scared off the farmhand before then leaving the barn and sitting on the porch. As the farmer was sitting on the porch, watching the farmhand quite literally run for the hills, he noticed a large dark shape stalking him from just beyond the tree line; it kept following the farmhand till he was over the nearby hills, after which it charged from out of the woods in pursuit. The farmer went to the town hollering about some monster that he saw, some took him seriously, and most laughed at him, all they knew was that the farmhand was never seen again. The farmer would remarry, have five kids, and would never see this creature again. This Farmer was my great grandfather, and I learned all of this from my dad.  
So one day me and my friends are shooting the shit at our main spot, this huge concrete building right beside the river. It had these large storage rooms each with 9 inch thick steel doors, apparently this place was used to store the explosives used by the miners, the doors were there in case anything blew up prematurely, or at least this is what Avery told me. So we're all sat there, talking about school, people we like/hate, the usual shit kids our age talk about, not necessary for what i'm telling you. So Avery is reading a book, Devon's trying to make a spark from smashing bits of concrete together, Martha's using sharpened bits of concrete to make knives out of sticks, and i'm sitting there talking shit about this one absolute fucking dictator of a teacher. This goes on until Devon suddenly perks up and says he has an idea.   
"So y'all know I'm taking history, right. And right now we're learning about the history of the town. and so we just started an assignment about the town's legends, mainly the one about the Beast."   
"that's pretty cool, I guess." responds Avery, still with her head buried in her book, not really paying attention.  
 "exactly right, so we're talking about the different areas where the Beast has been, sighted, different evidence from it, you know, shit like that, stuff that OP is into." he responds while looking at me.   
"what are you getting at then?" I asked Devon,   
"Well I just remembered that around this building was where they found some evidence of it, and even saw the Beast" Devon responded with.   
I now knew what he was getting at now, and it was a bad idea. First off, we don't have a map so we could easily get lost, second, whatever evidence they got from there was probably fake or misidentified, and third, why the hell are you even interested in going to this place? last I checked you didn't give a shit about urban legends. I told this to Devon, who just looked at me defeated.   
Then Martha stops her whittling and turns to me and Devon, "Wait, are we going to look for the Beast?" she asks in a clearly excited tone.   
"That actually sounds like fun!" exclaimed Avery in agreement with Martha, godamnit Avery, you fucking simp.   
Devon then looked at me with a smug look of victory. Martha reached into her backpack and pulled out a small folded piece of paper. She then unfolds the paper and it doubles in size, she then gives it to Devon and asks him where the sighting was. He then points to a spot on the paper and says “right there”. I was confused, so I got up behind Devon to see what was on the paper. The paper was a map of the area, with the building circled in red marker.   
I sighed in annoyance before turning back to Martha, “how long have you had that?”  
She shrugs, “not that long, got it from the souvenir shop.”  
“So we’re going then?” Devon chimes in.  
I sigh, “I guess we might as fucking well.”  
So with that, we left the comfort of the concrete and rust covered ruins, and headed off deeper into the woods. We were following this one trail for about an hour, Martha leading the way with Avery close behind her, me and Devon far in the back. We then started bushwhacking through the woods, off the trail, Martha had the smart idea to tie some cloth to a tree incase we got lost. So the reason we’re walking through the woods now, is because we need to get to a specific part of the river, a part that is inaccessible by trails or woods. Now, it's starting to get pretty dark out. If I remember correctly it was around 6:15, when we finally reached the part of the river. This part of the river was less of a river and more of a swamp, the river broke apart and flowed through multiple criss crossing streams. This caused the surrounding land to become muddy, and this allowed for swamp plants to grow.   
Now according to Devon, the Beast was sighted like six times in this swamp, so we thought it would be the best place to start looking. Now, I know this sounds stupid, but we split up to cover more ground. Me and Devon went one way while Martha and Avery went another. We kept in contact through walkie talkies that Martha always brought for games we would play at the ruins, so we were set. Me and Devon began searching through some ravines, making sure not to slip on the fresh mud and fall into the streams. The smell, my god the smell, if you have ever walked through a swamp after a fresh rain, you know what im talking about. The smell of sulfur was strong, it was like we were surrounded by rotting food. Me and Devon tried our best to ignore it, while we searched the area. While we did this, Martha and Avery searched the edge of this small pond, that was basically just a giant getty created by the streams converging. Because of this, it is extremely dangerous to try to swim in the pond, and there are signs all around it warning of potential death.   
Martha called us over her walkie talkie, “hey guys, so we’re at the death pond, and we found something weird.”  
I respond back, “ah really, what d’ya find?”  
“You know how the pond is surrounded by warning signs? Well, a bunch of them are really bent, like a car hit ‘em or something.”  
Devon catches this and grabs the walkie talkie from me, “holy shit dude, that's gotta be some evidence. Can you take a photo of them?”  
Martha sighs over the talkie, “trust me man, I would. But my phone’s dead and Avery’s is on low battery, and she doesn’t want to use it”  
Devon curses, before handing it back to me, “do you want us to come over to y’all?”  
“Nah, it's all good. You guys continue searching your area.” Martha responds before disconnecting.  
“They’re probably making out, you know?” Devon remarks.  
“Shut up, dumbass,” I retorted.  
“Hey, i'm just observing the situation”   
“You ain’t observing shit. Besides, you know damn well that Avery is way too chicken shit to pull something like that.”  
Devon shrugs, “I dunno man, love makes people stupid, even someone as smart as Avery”   
I just roll my eyes and continue walking through the ravine. After a few minutes of finding nothing, we decided to regroup with Martha and Avery by the pond. When we arrive there, Avery and Martha are sitting on a log looking over the map. Me and Devon immediately understood what Martha was talking about with the signs. About five or six of them were bent and distorted in various directions. Mind you, the sign posts were made of steel, so the only thing that could’ve twisted the signs like that was a car, but the swamp was surrounded by thick forest. The sight of these fucked up signs made devon ecstatic, I was just confused, as was Avery. Devon pulled out his phone to take a picture of the signs, and after he took it we heard a rustle in the bushes. Almost simultaneously, we turned our heads towards the thick bushes. I'll admit, I was pretty creeped out by this. I think Avery was creeped out too, but Devon and Martha were giddy, especially Devon. Devon held up his camera again, while Martha slowly approached the bush. When she got within about a meter of the bush, a small rabbit bolted out of it, and this caused Martha to flinch and Avery to yelp. After this, we all began laughing at the stupidity of the situation. However, afterwards, Devon looked at his phone with confusion, then shock, then fear. And when I say fear, I am aware that damn near nothing can really scare Devon, we learned that through our pranks. But when he looked at his phone, his face went fucking pale. I was the first to notice this, and immediately walked over to him.  
“Hey man, are you good?” I asked while holding his shoulders.  
Martha and Avery got up and walked over as well. But  Devon was still silently staring at his phone.  
“Listen man, you're freaking me out. Are you okay”   
Devon finally looks up at me and turns his phone for all of us to see. Now we can see what he was looking at. It was the picture he took of the busted up signs. We didn’t notice anything wrong with it, it was just of the signs and some of the forest behind them. Devon noticed this and zoomed in on a specific part of the picture. We looked closer at the picture, trying to see what Devon was trying to show. I was the first to notice it. At first I thought it was a shadow, of a tree or one of us. But as I looked closer, I realized what it was, and I felt my blood run cold. In the picture, probably 20 meters away in the distance, was a figure. It was tall, really fucking tall, now the bushes in the swamp were pretty damn big, maybe 5 feet tall and 7 wide, but this thing was fucking crouching and it still stood well above them. It was covered in patches of dark gray hair that partially covered its scaly skin, the hair was tangled with various twigs and leaves, like camouflage. It had a long tail like a lizard crossed with a monkey. And its head was like a monkey’s, but more reptilian. That's the best way to describe it actually, like a reptilian primate. Anyways, I'm getting off track. So after we all notice this fucking thing in the picture, we all damn near shit our pants. So we decided to get the fuck out of dodge, and basically sprinted back to our meetup spot at the ruins. Now, from this point on, my memory gets a little hazy, probably because of the stress of the situation. So from what I can remember, Devon started freaking out and so did Avery, with me and Martha having to calm them down.   
We decide to return to our homes and try to discuss what happened in a safer environment. So we’re talking about this over discord, mainly trying to see if we had been followed back. Now, I forgot to mention this earlier, but Avery had been recording the entire trip on her phone, so she shared it with us over discord so we could review it. We didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, so we assumed we were in the clear. We said our goodnights, and logged off. But something didn’t sit right with me about the footage, I just felt like something was wrong with it. So after dinner, I decided to review the footage again myself. This leads to the reason I posted this on here. When I rewatched the footage over again, I noticed that this…creature showed up somewhere in every. Single. Fucking. Recording. Never the main focus, but always off to the side in the distance, fucking watching us. Upon seeing this my blood froze and my hairs stood on end. I was more scared at that moment than I had been in a long time. Afterwards I immediately told all of this to the others, and they had similar reactions. Then I decided to hop on Reddit and type all of this up. So once again, I'm asking you all, if any of you know what I'm talking about, please share anything that could help.
