Have you ever asked yourself, "Am I perfectly sane?" or "Am I seeing everything clearly?" or maybe even "Did I leave that door open?"

I have had to cut the people out of my life, the ones that don't believe me. The ones that don't believe the dreams I had and the things I have seen. I have always considered myself sane, sane, sane as can be. A perfectly normal, happy, can-do hard-working individual that has common sense - has reason - can distinguish reality from fiction. More and more I question if I truly have gone mad, or if it is all true. I wish I could just peel the answer off like a band-aid and just have it over with, but it is not so.

I suppose I should stop blathering on and get to it.

I've been having these dreams for about five months now. At first it was just I wake up in my bed, in my room, and go about my life like it was normal - but then I would wake up in reality and be confused why it was the same day - why the milk was still left in the fridge - why the coffee machine was still broken. I didn't understand.

Then it got weirder.

When I would go about my day - my day in the dreams - the world was empty of people. Cars left in park on the road, shops open with no one in them, and just the absence of any human noise. These dreams felt like they would last for hours or sometimes days. When I would wake up I would recall the past few days I spent in my dream, but I wake up and it's the morning again, and I realise it wasn't real. Again, I was just confused and brought it down to being just weird dreams.

Then, can you believe, it got stranger?

I would wake up, again, in my room and in my bed, but there would always be someone at the door, knocking. The first time I felt so startled I put a chair in front of it,  the person still knocking as I stayed in the room for what felt like days. But one time, I decided to open it. Looking at me, was myself, with a stupid, forced grin and bulging, glistening eyes that stared at me. It looked like it was crying. As you can imagine, again, the first time I was terrified and ran away, the thing following slowly like a shitty Michael Myers. After, God, maybe a week, I decided to speak to it.

"Hello? You good?"

And when it opened its mouth and was about to speak, I would wake up. I tried and tried, but I would still wake up. The next time I just opened the door and stared at it, but it was unwavering. Eventually, just to see what would happen, I touched it. It felt solid - felt real - but again, it just stood there, eyes bulging out and mouth stretched wide. I thought maybe it was some sort of sign - you know - that maybe in reality I was actually pretending to be happy but on the inside I was fucked up? I didn't know. How could I have known?

And could you believe it, it got even weirder?

The next time I woke up in the dream bed, same dream room, the thing was standing directly next to me, just looking down at me. I didn't know why, but I didn't feel scared even when it reached out and its fingers wrapped around my head, up my nose, down my throat and into my eyes. It plucked them out - without any pain - as without my eyes I heard bones breaking, flesh wriggling and the entire feeling of something stretching my mouth open wide and crawling into me. Then I could see again, after what felt like ages, and the thing was gone. I went about whatever dream bullshit I would usually do, this time again with people, before I would wake up.

And everything was normal, perfectly, perfectly normal after that. I would wake up, and always be very, very happy. I had to cut the people out of my life because they didn't understand. They couldn't comprehend that I am beautiful, I am perfect and I am amazing. They couldn't understand I had to leave part of myself behind. They couldn't imagine the possiblity I am a new person - I am reborn.

But the perfectly normal, perfectly odd thing, is that, when I dream, I dream of someone knocking at my door, calling out to me.
