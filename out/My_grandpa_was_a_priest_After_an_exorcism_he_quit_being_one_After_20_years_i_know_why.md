My grandpa was a hell of a guy for sure. He had a great life, had 3 sons, 7 grandkids and a loving wife. Thats all he needed.

I remember when i was a kid i sometimes heard about his job back in the nineties. i was around 4 that time, maybe five. He was our town's priest. Everyone knowed and loved him. i heard roumors spreading about a girl from my school. Her name was Elizabeth if im right. Kids said that he was posessed cuz she would talk to himself, draw upside-down crosses and stuff like that.

The worst thing that he did (wich people saw) was smash a kid in the head with a rock because "The voices in my head said so". Her parents didn't know what to do so they called my grandpa. They said she might be posessed. I remember i was at home playing with my brother Jonathan., my grandpa came to us and said "kids grandpa will be gone for a few days, behave well understood?"

We said yes then he left. We didn't know where he was going but we did as he said. After 4 days he came back. But he wasnt the same anymore. When he arrived he was pale like a sheet that has been freshly washed. When we asked what happened he said "nothing happened". He sadly passed in 2010.

Nine years later my grandma died too so we had to clean out the house so it could be sold. I was cleaning the attic with my cousin Sebastian. We came across a big wooden box. It needed a key but we didnt know wich so we just smashed the lock with a hammer.

In it was a little black notebook. As we opened it we found writings of my late grandpa. It was about his stories. Like how we went to visit Lake Balaton in Hungary and stuff like that. But one thing caught my eye. It was about Lizzy (as the teachers called her). It read:

1979.02.25: 8pm  
I have arrived at the house. The girl was locked down in the basement on a wooden bed. He was screaming in a foreign language wich none of us knew about. It was strange. Her eyes were yellow, She was couching up blood, he was screaming in a mans voice. I started the exorcism. It went well for the most parts but she started having a seizure, the worst one i have seen yet in my career of being a priest. It was like she was coughing up bloodclouds. I had to call father Ryan from the neighbouring town. I felt like i couldnt do it for some reason.

1979.02.26: 12am

\-Reveal thy name demon- Father Ryan said. But it didnt work. Nothing worked. All she did was scream and speak in latin as we found out from one of our friend. We couldnt translate it yet but she or should i say it said:

Vado ad patrem meum Et Michael. nihil facere potes quod stimulum fallas.

We tried as hard as we could to get out at least something from It. But nothing happened. Im starting to lose faith that its going to work.

1979.02.27. 5am

She had another seizure this was the worst so far. She sit up Said something in latin then laid down and passed out. We couldnt get what she said. What a pity. We tried holy water, bible pages. Nothing worked. Im starting to believe we cant do anything. But we have to try. We have to save her.

1979.02.28 9pm

We tried. I can't believe it. I couldnt save her. The last thing she said was:

Im 'iens ut tardius accipere familiam tuam seorsum a piece piece et youll' satus tecum, vos fraudantes familiam relicto spumam

Ill probably never know what it said. Im going to quit. I cant take the burden. Its too much.

This was the last thing about the exorcism in his notebook. The scarier thing was the stuff he later wrote.

2010.03.04

I can see her. Yesterday she was floating above my bed speaking latin. Now i understand. It knows whhat im thinking about. It knows all my family member's names. I cant take it. I dont know what is going to happen.

The last phrase he ever wrote in this notebook was:

Tu quoque Michael. Im ' agnus dei cruciare vobis in mortem
