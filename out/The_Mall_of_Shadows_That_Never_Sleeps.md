The rain had just started when Jonah and I pulled into the parking lot of Edenridge Mall. It looked like something out of a forgotten decade—flickering signs, fogged-up windows, and not a single soul outside. But we figured we’d wait out the storm, maybe poke around the old bookstore for a while.

We walked in holding hands, and that was the last time I felt safe.

The second we passed through the sliding doors, something changed. It wasn’t just quiet—it was off. The lights buzzed, the air felt thick, and the mall swallowed sound in that way that made your breath feel too loud.

When we turned around to leave, the entrance was gone. Not locked—gone. Just a smooth tiled wall where glass had been. Jonah cursed under his breath and reached out like he could will the doors back into existence. I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. My throat was already tightening.

We wandered for what felt like hours until we found a hallway we hadn’t noticed before. The walls were white and glowing faintly, like they were lit from inside. At the end of the corridor, one word was stenciled in red above a door:

**ORIENTATION.**

I don’t know why we went in. Curiosity? Hope? Fear?

Inside was a square room, dim and cold, with walls covered in Polaroid pictures. Hundreds of them, all pinned in neat little rows like someone was tracking insects. I froze.

Right in front of me—was my face. My photo. One I’d never taken. Underneath it, a note written in red marker:

“Scenario: Horror - 6 Days to Survive.”

I turned to Jonah to say something—but he was gone.

No sound. No movement. He’d just disappeared.

Then the lights blinked, and I wasn’t in the room anymore.

I stood inside a dusty little boutique filled with broken mannequins and melted candles. A bell dinged over the door, and a woman in a red apron looked up from the counter. Her eyes were hollow, wrong.

“You’ll be here for six days,” she said like it was nothing. “You must survive.”

I wanted to ask what that meant, but she only smiled. Then everything went dark again.

⸻

I lost track of time.

One day I was hiding in the freezer of a butcher shop, the next I was trapped in the mall’s kitchen, scrubbing dishes with shaking hands. Other people were there, too—eating, shopping, waiting. But if I whispered to them, “This isn’t real,” or “Wake up,” they’d glitch. Their eyes would stutter, heads twitch—and then I’d shift.

Back to another version of the mall.

Every time I tried to fight the system, the mall rewrote me. Changed my role. My clothes. My purpose. My memories. Well, most of them. 
Jonah was out there somewhere. That much I knew. I felt it.

Sometimes, by some strange alignment of fate, we’d land in the same timeline. One night I found myself in the food court, and my phone buzzed for the first time in weeks. My heart nearly stopped.

Jonah?

“I remember now,” he whispered, voice raw. “We were trying to leave. The truck is in the parking lot. We need to go **now**!

We ran. Hand in hand. Through flickering halls and crumbling tiles. Out into the night air that should have been freedom.

But the truck was never there.

We searched the lot, row by row. Every time we found something that looked like ours, it vanished. Reset. Until—

He vanished again.

⸻

Every time I get close to the truth, *he* resets me.

The Time Maker.

I’ve never seen him clearly, but I know he’s there. Watching from the monitors, walking behind the walls. Changing our stories like a child playing with dolls. Every photo, every scenario, every “timeline”—he writes it.

I hope I have enough bars on my phone to get this out into the world in hopes of someone having advice on how to help us get out of here. 

I’m starting to remember everything. I’m starting to fight back. And if I can find Jonah again, if we can hold on just long enough—we’re going to find The Time Maker and end this.

Even if it costs us everything.
