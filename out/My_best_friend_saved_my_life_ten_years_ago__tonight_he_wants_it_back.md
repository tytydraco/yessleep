I'm sharing this account of events because I need a record outside of my own head. Maybe some of you will remember for me if it disappears. To be honest, I'm not even sure I can trust that I wrote it. All I can do is put it out there.

---

We left the city before dusk. Anna was driving, the radio low, her fingers drumming absently on the wheel.

"I'm looking forward to Maya's cooking," she said. "If I have to eat one more of your well-done steaks, my jaw's going to break."

I chuckled, but my heart wasn't in it.

"You're quieter than usual, Mark."

"Just reminiscing," I replied. "It's been over a decade since we started the business. Who could believe it?"

"You mean since you and Eric started it."

I shook my head. "We all five did. You remember those nights in the basement?"

"They were good times." Silence stretched until she said what we were both thinking, "Until he saved you from that drunk driver."

"Yeah," I paused. "It cost him a lot."

"You tried to help."

"He doesn't see it that way. We're all rich. He's… not."

We were both lost in thought as the miles passed us by.

"Did we leave Baxter enough food?" I asked.

Both amused and grateful for the change of subject, she replied "You filled his bowl twice."

"He's probably still hungry."

"Please. He's probably on the couch ruining the nice shirt I got you and watching TV like always."

I smiled. "He's got a good life."

"You'd save that dog before me if the world ended."

"That's because he doesn't complain about my cooking."

Her laughter softened the air.

Steve and Maya's house was large, but not imposing, all natural wood and soft colors. The door opened before we could knock, and Maya hugged Anna first, then me. "You made it! Everyone's been waiting. That is a *lovely* blazer by the way, Anna."

"Thanks!" she replied, "Mark got it for my birthday, violet's his favorite color."

"Sorry for the wait," I said. "Traffic. And my nerves."

"Still dramatic." Maya's smile widened as she nudged my arm with her elbow.

Steve followed her out with two glasses of scotch. "Protocol. You know the rules."

We caught up as we walked through the foyer. Steve spoke with his trademark grin, that always put everyone at ease. Maya asked how life had treated us, and listened with her usual undivided attention, letting you know she actually cared.

Then Steve nodded over his shoulder, a little too casually, "Eric's out back on the porch. He said he wanted some air."

I took a moment to gather myself, and walked out to say hello.

---

He stood leaning over the railing, his cane propped to the side. I took one look back over my shoulder at the others. The glass doors caught our reflections in the faint glow from inside. Mine stood straight; Eric's leaned slightly to one side, his subtle limp expressing itself even as he stood still.

"Mark." He turned to face me. "You made it."

"Wouldn't miss it."

He smiled, his eyes still accusatory. "You leading the intervention or do I get to keep my pride tonight?"

I lifted my palms. "Easy, man, I just wanted to say hello and see how you're doing."

He snorted, eyes rolling slightly. "It doesn't matter. I didn't need charity then, and I don't need it now. I have my own things going on."

"That's great! I always said you were the smartest of us. Care to clue me in?"

"I've been working on… balance." He didn't elaborate.

Eric had certainly gotten stranger. Not wanting to pull at that thread, I changed the subject. "What's that?" I asked, noticing a strange carving in his hand.

"Something I picked up while traveling in Jerusalem."

"Wow, glad to hear you've been getting around. Still collecting oddities I see?"

He frowned. "Not collecting. Researching." He ran his thumb along the knuckles of what I could now see was a small carving shaped like a human hand, fingers half-curled as if trying to grasp at something. It was carved in such a way that the grain of the wood and its stain looked like embalmed human skin.

"They call this one ***Envy***. I've been studying it for years."

As I looked at the carving, my breath held and I unconsciously took a step back. I was sure for a moment that the wood's grain had shifted, as if a tendon underneath were flexing. Unbidden, I imagined it reaching for my pocket.

Things had taken a weird turn. I'd come out here to make peace, maybe help Eric find his footing. Instead we were both staring at this creepy little hand.

In an almost hypnotic trance, he stroked it gently and whispered.

&nbsp;

"***Thou shalt not covet…***"

&nbsp;

The phrase ended, but I was certain there had been more. I had just heard it, yet for the life of me I could not remember the rest of it.

Eric slipped the carving into his jacket pocket. "Come on, we shouldn't keep the others waiting." He picked up his cane and made his way toward the door.

As I turned with him, I caught my own reflection in the glass door once again, and something about it looked… lonely. I shrugged it off and followed Eric.

---

Maya and Steve set the table, smells of garlic, rosemary, and tenderloin filling the air. Maya always chose steak when I was on the guestlist so she could extol the virtues of medium-rare.

"Finally," she said. "We were about to start without you!"

Eric set a hand on the back of the chair next to Anna. "Then it's a good thing we showed up!" He pulled it out and sat beside her. I hesitated, then took the chair on his other side. 

Maya lifted her glass. "To old friends."

It felt nostalgic for awhile; banter, old shorthand, a familiar rhythm from our youth. Maya complimented Anna on her lovely red blazer. Steve talked about some hijinks on their Europe trip. Eric told a cute story about his and Anna's engagement.

Something about the story was off, like it was taken from a Hallmark movie. Eric was watching me intently, then when he saw me noticing, smiled and redirected, "You remember the smell of that basement?"

I grinned. "The solder, the plastic, the takeout boxes. I still have dreams about it."

We talked then about the beginning. I didn't know why his guard finally came down, but I was grateful to have my friend back. We recalled when we first formed the company, bringing the others on board, about how our friendship in those days held us together no matter what.

"Eric, I know I've already said it a thousand times, but I really am grateful for what you did back then."

His expression darkened immediately. I should have expected it. "You weren't grateful enough to wait for me."

Forks froze in place and conversations stopped mid-sentence.

"I thought I was doing it for you, for all of us. I didn't expect you to leave," I quietly replied.

"I was in recovery for years, drugged out on painkillers. And when I came back, the company had moved on to things I had nothing to do with."

"We didn't think of it as moving without you. I would have--"

Anna's napkin clenched in her fist as she leaned in. "It wasn't your decision to make. He lost so much for you, and you left him in the dust."

Eric looked surprised for a moment, then oddly enough, his anger evaporated, leaving a satisfied expression. It was Maya who answered, "None of us wanted him to leave. We've been trying to get him to come back this whole time."

Anna looked like she was about to retort, but Eric put a hand on her shoulder and interrupted everyone, "It's fine, I shouldn't have brought all this old stuff up. Let's continue enjoying good memories, eh?"

We all looked at him like he'd grown a second head. When did Eric become so easygoing?

---

Dinner wound down as we all finished our meals and talked about safer things. Steve and I broke off into the living room to reminisce. I strolled over to the open bar and grinned at him. "You still using Scotch as a personality trait?"

He smiled wryly. "Still works on most people." 

I poured us each a glass and we sat down by the fireplace to chat. After a while, the sound of Anna's laughter carried over from outside, she was standing close to Eric. The reflection of the firelight on the deck doors obstrmy view of them.

Steve followed my gaze, remarking, "It's good to see him like this. He's mellowing out in his older years."

"Yeah, Anna's been good for him."

Steve barked out a wry laugh, "I think she holds onto the anger more than he does."

I laughed with him. Then, something urged me to look outside again. I saw Eric reach into his pocket and whisper something to himself. He spoke quietly, yet I could clearly hear every word.

&nbsp;

"***Thou shalt not covet…***"

&nbsp;

This time, I recoiled a bit. "Once burned…," I thought to myself, but even before finishing the expression, it seemed out of place. When had I been burned?

I strained, willing myself to remember the rest of what he said. For a moment the phrase "neighbor's fellowships" slid across my thoughts, but it was like trying to hold water with a sieve. I downed the rest of my gin before Steve and I stood to join the others.

---

"… was impossible back then," Maya was saying as we entered. "All deadlines and no sleep. I thought he'd drive us into the ground."

"Who, me?" I asked.

They all turned around. Anna's expression didn't waver. "Who do you think, Mark?"

I smiled as if we were just joking around. "You make me sound like a tyrant."

"You were a bit intense," Steve murmured behind me.

Surprisingly, Eric was the only one who wasn't chiming in; he just stood in the back with a small smile.

I knew Anna blamed me for Eric leaving the company. But now I wondered if  all of them saw it that way. As CEO, there was a certain distance between us, so it was hard for me to keep a pulse on what everyone was thinking.

The conversation had continued on while I was musing to myself. They all laughed at something Eric said. I found myself laughing too, but it came a second too late, the rhythm was off. Conversation wandered after that, spilling into benign topics, and I slipped away to the bathroom.

Why was I here? We had been close once, but after the company grew, we were all isolated in our own departments. Listening to them now, I wondered. Had everyone drifted apart, or was it just me?

I realized that, as the evening went on, my chest had been feeling tighter and tighter, but I couldn't pinpoint why. I pulled out my phone and turned on the pet cam. Baxter was there, curled up on the couch, slobbering all over my sweatpants as always. I think I needed to see him to feel grounded.

Then I heard that whisper again. Eric's voice, whispering softly in another room, yet perfectly audible as if he were speaking into my ear.

&nbsp;

"***Thou shalt not covet…***"

&nbsp;

The words were spoken calmly, but a ball of ice formed in the pit of my stomach. All I could think of was getting out of there. When I turned toward the doorway, the hall was empty, dark.

The air was thick, holding me still as a statue, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. The moment lingered, and then Anna said something to Maya in the distance, laughing loudly, and it faded away.

---

By the time I came back into the room, conversation had shifted to the company. Maya spoke about hiring difficulties in her department, Eric talked about an acquisition he was working on, Anna went over a new optimization her team was testing.

I hadn't said a word to anyone for some time now; nobody seemed to notice. They weren't purposely trying to flaunt their success, but nonetheless, they had the shared trials of building all this together, and the shared triumphs to go with it.

None of that included me. How could it? I was the guy who left the company before it took off, and then never really amounted to much. We may have been friends in college, but it was small wonder we had drifted apart.

I continued my glum thoughts on the side, half-turned away, pretending to check my phone as if I had important things to do. The tightening in my chest intensified; I glanced nervously over my shoulder, struggling to find something to explain it.

Maya was pouring another round for everyone. Steve was giving Anna the recipe for the salmon piccata we had for dinner. It all sounded perfectly ordinary. Then, from somewhere behind me, quiet and deliberate, came Eric's voice.

&nbsp;

"***Thou shalt not covet…***"

&nbsp;

This time was different; some unspoken boundary had been crossed. I sensed that whatever spectre had been haunting my periphery had finally gotten bold enough to touch me directly, and that terrified me.

My heart was pounding, my breaths ragged. I stood up shakily, and grabbed my cane to steady myself, but I stumbled and its rubber foot squealed on the wooden floor. Eric walked over, glass in hand, moving easily. He stood tall, and walked with a strong, confident gait. "Hey, you ok, buddy?"

"Yes… I'm fine." I stammered. "I'm just getting a little tired, I should be getting home."

He smirked. "It was good to see you, Mark." His tone was mocking, and yet there was a ring of truth to it. He was, unmistakably, pleased to have seen me tonight.

The others kept talking, their laughter soft and distant, unaware of my departure.

"I should get going," I heard myself say louder.

Maya waved distractedly. "Drive safe."

I nodded, already stepping away. My limp made the floorboards creak unevenly, but no one looked up.

---

When I reached my building, I fumbled with the keys. My hands were stiff, clumsy. The door opened into the familiar dimness of my apartment, my dingy old tiny studio in the bad part of town. A draft of cold air greeted me; the landlord still hadn't fixed that radiator.

Baxter trotted over, tail wagging excitedly. I crouched stiffly, the ache in my leg flaring. "Hey, boy." Baxter was the only friend I had in the world. He'd always been with me, never judging, always supporting. Even now, the gentle swishing sound of his tail on the floorboards comforted me.

He followed me to my desk, and I sat down, turning on the light. I took a moment to compose myself, and for the first time all night, the fog that blunted my memory and my thinking began to lift. Getting some distance must have helped to repel it.

I opened my browser and started writing. It felt important to record and report these events, so the truth would be known by *somebody* out there. 

It is a surreal experience, even as I type these words now. I record the events of the night, but they are not as I remember, hinting at a life that is entirely different from mine. But the words come all the same, like I'm tracing grooves someone has already carved.

Something deep in my soul tells me that this is the truth, and the life of isolation and poverty I remember is the lie. I'm afraid to ask where these words are coming from.

Is this an act of defiance on my part, a desperate attempt to record the truth in these fleeting moments when I can grasp it? Or is *he* giving me this truth so I can know what he has taken from me?

I sense him grasping the relic now, and I am compelled to continue writing. This one time he allows me to recall everything he says.

&nbsp;

"***Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's beast.***"

&nbsp;

The gentle sounds of a swishing tail go silent as if they had never been.
