There haven’t been any stars in the sky lately. 

I was relaxing on my balcony when I noticed. It was a small, passing thought. Maybe it would stun you for a second; elicit some kind of small investigation— make you search through your recent memory, until, inevitably, those panicked thoughts thrust themselves into your head: 

*No, of course there were. You just saw them. A few days, maybe? A week…? No, no. It hasn’t been over a month, has it?*

Such thoughts would bring about forced rationalizations—  I mean, who *really* remembers the last cloud they saw? The last speck of dust, the last blade of grass? There was something omnipresent about the natural things of the world. I may not see a mountain every day, but I know they exist. I know there are branches on every tree, leaves on every branch. I know that when I saunter my way atop the hard asphalt and concrete in my nightly-run to the local bodega, dirt exists beneath, and further, the foundational rock that makes up the Earth’s mantle.

But there is no mistaking the undeniable reality in front of me. You dig, you see dirt. You walk for long enough, you see the ocean. You look up, you see—

No, no, no. Something’s wrong. Cloudless summer skies— I would see something. Up until recently, I would have a drink and read on my north-facing balcony nearly every night. I distinctly remember seeing the stars of Ursa Major lounging in my seat. It couldn’t have been more than… god, how long has it been? It’s as if that lightless void is taunting me— the clouds missing from that deep, ethereal black are instead finding their home within my fickle gray matter. Where are they? It’s time to start keeping track. 

I’m sick and tired of people calling me crazy. Are they not seeing this? *Where are the fucking stars?* I started posting pictures of the sky every night. They look damn near identical, which would make sense if there were any goddamn stars in the sky. But it’s just black. Nothing. Darkness. So devoid of anything, that I may as well just cover my cell camera. I write the same caption every time:

*Where are the stars?*

I’ll link the coordinates to a star map. It shows the positions of the *exact* set of stars that should be visible from my location depending on the time of day. There’s nothing, not even a speck, a single glitter, a sparkle, it’s just that *fucking* void. 

I can’t stand being out in the dark anymore. The dim city streetlamps seem to slowly bleed-out as each day passes without the assistance of the naturally-lit celestial sky. My investigation has devolved into short peeks from the blinds of a tightly shut window. In here, it’s dark. But christ, out there? I didn’t know a city could be just… pitch black. So imperceptibly dark that the surroundings mesh with the night in such a way that the horizon is obliterated, and any semblance of an outline or perspective fades away into a Stygian homogeneity. 

I… 

I don’t know where I’m looking anymore. 

*Where are the fucking stars?* 

*Where the fuck am I?*

*Where the fuck are we?*

We, as a *species*, are kept sane by certain natural truths. That there is something out there, that there are stars, that there is an ocean, that there are trees, that there are— *fuck me*, is anyone else even still out there? 

I keep posting the *same* fucking photo over and over again; god— am I even looking up anymore? Where in here starts and out there starts is becoming impossible to perceive. I— am I even taking pictures? It’s not just sight— I don’t even feel right. It’s heavy, as if I fell into a barrel of jet-black paint, thrashing, flailing, struggling to breathe, this intolerable weight dragging me deeper and deeper into a silent, encompassing abyss. I don’t understand what’s   happening. I can’t stop looking *deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deep—*

There is something omnipresent about the natural things of the world. *There are branches on every tree, leaves on every branch.*

No no— this isn’t me. Something’s happening. I’m feeling myself slowly drift away. I need to get the message out— I need to get the message out— I need to— 

WHERE ARE THE STARS?

You dig, you see dirt. You walk, you see the ocean.  

You dig, you see dirt. You walk, you see the ocean.  

You dig, you see dirt. You walk, you see the ocean.  

You dig, you see dirt. You walk, you see the ocean.  

You dig, you see dirt. You walk, you see the ocean.  

I’m looking up. 

I took a photo. It’s the same.

Where are the stars?

I took a photo. It’s the same.
