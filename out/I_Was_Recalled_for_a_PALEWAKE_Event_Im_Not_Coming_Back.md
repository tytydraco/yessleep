I was halfway through unpacking when they called.

Two years retired, and I still jumped whenever my phone rang. Bad habits from a bad career, I guess. But this call didn’t come from any number I recognized. Just a scrambled string of digits and a voice I hadn’t heard since my last debriefing.

“Edward,” the phone on the voice said. “You’re being reactivated.”

I swallowed hard. It wasn’t a surprise really – I’d been waiting for the day they pulled me back in. We used to call it the *retirement mission*. One last job you don’t get to refuse. You think you're finally free of the Order, then the phone rings and you remember: you were never out.

“You leave in three hours. Bring nothing personal. Transportation is arranged.”

I asked *where* I’m going, just out of instinct – not expectation.

“You’ll be briefed on the way. This is PALEWAKE-authorized.”

Then the line cut I stood in the silence for a long minute, staring at the wall. I had never seen a PALEWAKE clearance in action — only in redacted files and whispered rumors. A global extinction-level protocol. The kind of thing you think is theoretical. Until it isn’t.

Three hours later, I was on a boat with one bag and a name I hadn’t spoken in over a decade. The air was thick with salt and something colder than sea wind. The fog started early and the island didn’t show up on any chart.

But I knew where we were going.

Everyone in the Order knows the lighthouse eventually.

The boat was small. Inside, just me, the pilot and a few covered crates tied down under a tarp. I tried to start a conversation once or twice, but the man at the wheel didn’t speak.

He looked like he’d been doing this route his whole life. Calm, detached from reality. Probably former Order himself. They don’t use civilians for deliveries like this, only trusted personnel.

After a while, I gave up on small talk and stared out into the fog. It was thick enough to make the horizon disappear. There were no waves or sound – just the hum of the engine and a cold pressure in my chest that didn’t seem to disappear.

The boat rocked gently as we moved forward, and I let my thoughts drift. Not because I wanted to, but because the silence gave me no other choice.

It’s strange what the mind clings to when there’s nothing to distract it, isn’t it?

I didn’t think back to the missions or subjects I encountered. Neither to the briefings printed in red ink and sealed in wax. Not even the containment breaches.

I thought about Ellis.

He was the first senior agent I shadowed, back when I still believed the Order had rules. He was sharp and quiet – not the kind who gave speeches, but he still made you listen. People said he’d seen things at Facility-Oxford and never fully recovered from that.

He taught me everything I know today – how to survive, thrive in the Order. How to handle the silence. How to recognize when something is watching – not with eyes, but with intent.

“Trust the silence more than the sound,” he used to say. I thought it was cryptic nonsense back then. Now, with this fog pressing in on all sides, I understand. “What’s missing tells you more than what’s there.”

I hadn’t thought about him in years. He vanished in ’09, mid-assignment. We were told he’d been reassigned to “remote observation”.

That was Order jargon for *never ask again.*

And now, they’re sending me to the lighthouse – *the* lighthouse, the one that needs supervision at all times. The one no one leaves.

I wondered, not for the first time, if Ellis ended up there. Am I now being sent to “remote observation” like he was? Does that mean he died there – and am I going to?

I closed my eyes, trying to quiet my thoughts. *Breathe, Edward. It’ll be fine.*

The island rose out of the fog like a bruise.

There was no dock, just a black stone slick with algae and a rusted metal ladder bolted to the side. The boatman said nothing when I looked at him. He just pointed up.

I climbed in silence, cold wind bit at my knuckles and the ocean below was too still. I half expected to hear waves or gulls – but there was only the slap of wet boots against the ladder.

The climb wasn’t long, but it still felt endless.

At the top, the island stretched no more than a few hundred feet in any direction. There was a single footpath leading to the only structure on the island.

The lighthouse.

It stood like a monolith swallowed in fog. Old stonework patched with rusted plates. Its glass eye was dark, the metal housing around it cracked and weather-torn.

I didn’t wait for a welcome.

The door groaned on its hinges. Inside I was met with a narrow corridor where only one person could fit. My nose filled with the smell of dust and rot.

I heard a dull *clang* from above me. Then a wet, dragging noise, like something was being pulled out of the water.

I froze, one hand on the stair rail and waited.

Nothing.

I took the stairs slowly, my steps groaning under my weight. The dragging didn’t return.

At the top, the observation deck was empty. There were no signs of anything I’d heard from below. No movement or footprints. Not even water.

Whatever had made the noise, it was gone now. Or never there at all, I’m not sure.

Back down, I checked the living quarters. There wasn’t much to them, just a bed, a rust-stained stink, and a stove with a pot still on the burner. I also found a hatch leading to the generator room. And then…

The body.

Slumped at the desk, collapsed across the logbook. His skin tight over bone. Clothes rotted but recognizable beneath the dust.

I was right. For all these years, I knew it.

It was Ellis.

He hadn’t aged much. Or, more precisely, not in the way you’d expect after over a decade. His beard had been white before he vanished. Just deeper lines now.

After a solemn prayer, I looked down at the open page of the logbook. The last entry was scrawled in a hand I remembered from field reports and briefing memos:

“The fog isn’t moving anymore. I hope they send someone. We need to keep it at bay.”

I closed the book and stepped back. Above me, the light remained off. I felt the fog pressing against the glass, waiting to be let in.

I didn’t sleep that night.

I don’t even think I sat down.

I stayed near the main corridor, checking the glass on the upper levels every hour – watching the fog. Seeing if they come closer.

The light remained off, and I couldn’t get the generator working. *The backup batteries better last*, I thought to myself.

By morning – if it *was* morning – visibility dropped to near zero. The fog has grown so thick it pressed against the window, almost bursting in. I couldn’t see ten feet from the upper deck. And yet, I kept feeling it.

Movement. Not physical or measurable – just a shift in the fog.

The same way you feel a figure behind you in a mirror. Or a shape beneath the ice (God knows I know a lot about this).

It circled the entire tower with pressure.

Each time the structure creaked, I tensed. Each time the hallway lights flickered, I reached for the wrench propped beside the panel.

Eventually, the backup batteries began to fail. A low warning tone echoed up the stairwell, before humming. One light at a time – *click… click… click…* \- the emergency corridor went dark.

I headed down. Fast.

The generator room was soaked with water. Was there a breach somewhere? Condensation poured down the walls like veins.

Then I saw the cables.

Coiled around the base of the generator. Slick, black and wrapped around the entire room like roots. They *throbbed* – not electrically, but organically.

I stepped closer, aiming to inspect them. The cables twitched ever so slightly – a rhythmic throb.

I didn’t know what they were. But I know what they weren’t: they weren’t ours.

Something had grown them. Or invited them.

The light hadn’t failed – it had been cut off.

Suddenly Ellis’s last words hit me harder than they should’ve.

>“The fog isn’t moving anymore. I hope they send someone. We need to keep it at bay.”

Not kill it. Not make it disappear or wait for it to dissolve.

But keep it at bay.

This place wasn’t meant to *contain* anything – it wasn’t a simple Order structure like a facility.

It was made to suppress it. Delay it.

And someone – *something* – had found a way to interfere.

I reached for the manual override, but hesitated. The breathing cables hissed beneath my boots.

If I restarted the generator, I might trigger something worse. A feedback surge, blowout, or in the worst case: a containment breach.

But if I waited any longer, the backup batteries would die, and then… then it wouldn’t matter.

I counted backwards from five.

Then tore the cables free.

The room screamed – not the metal or machinery – but the entire tower did.

Upstairs, the beacon housing cracked. A low tone rumbled through the walls.

I heard banging at the windows, like the fog was pressing up against it even harder.

I sprinted up the stairwell as the tower convulsed – doors slamming open one by one as I passed, water pouring out of them.

I reached the main terminal.

Power flickered once.

Then twice.

Then the light came on. It wasn’t gentle – it struck, like the beam sliced through the fog with a scalpel.

I saw something within the fog shudder – it recoiled.

But it wasn’t a creature. That would be simple for me to comprehend. I’ve seen dozens of those in my years in the Order. This was something else.

Something like a distortion. A fold in the world that shouldn’t be there. For a second it looked like a ship; then a face; then me.

The beam swept over it again, and it was gone.

I don’t know what it was, but I know it saw me.

And the light kept spinning. And since then, it never stopped. I made sure it wouldn’t.

The fog didn’t completely retreat, but I did manage to keep it at bay, as Ellis said. The pressure lifted – both from the tower and from me.

The cables in the generator room didn’t grow back.

I check all the systems daily, confirm power levels. All stable – at least for now.

Ellis’s logbook was still on the desk. I turned to the earlier pages, ones too faint to read before in the dark. And I read it all.

>“There always has to be one.

>The light doesn’t destroy the thing in the fog. It keeps it asleep. Barely.

>It doesn’t care about the lighthouse; it watches the people inside it.

>Automated systems fail. They don’t emit the same resonance. Presence is what matters.

>And it *knows* the difference.”

Further down:

>“If you’re reading this, you already know. They only send the ones who won’t walk away. The loyal. The ones who’ve seen enough not to let it out.

>You’ll stay because you have to. You understand.

>Because who else could they send?”

I closed the logbook.

No ceremony or orders like they usually do. Just the truth. Coming straight from Ellis.

I found it rather poetic.

There was a closet at the base of the stairs. I found a long coat inside of it, which I deduced to be Ellis’s.

I put it on.

The fabric fit like it had always been mine.

I cleaned the lenses that evening. Checked the beacon timing. Repaired what I could from the backup systems.

The fog hasn’t thickened since. And I’ve been here for quite some time now.

But I still feel it out there – expectant, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

The Order hasn’t called and they won’t. That was my last conversation with them – they made sure of it.

They sent someone who wouldn’t let the world burn.

And now, I wear Ellis’s coat. I sit where he once sat. And I watch the fog, turning the light, waiting for it to move again.

Because deep down, I know this:

It’s not the lighthouse that keeps the thing in the fog contained.
