Hello everyone! My family and I had a weird night at the great Wolf Lodge and wanted to check if anyone else had similar encounter at this place?

We've stayed here 3 times before with no problems ever but this was the first time anything like this has ever happened before.

We stayed at the Great Wolf Lodge and had a suite room at the newer location in Manteca CA. It has 2 conjoining rooms with two doors where you can lock the room from either side. The kids stayed in the kids style room with kids bunk beds and we stayed on the non kids side room.

We kept the doors open for both sides and I made sure the doors for both rooms were fully locked including the lock where you can't fully open the door from outside.

At midnight my Son (6 years old) ran into our room half awake next to our bed and was crying half asleep sitting up right next to us. I asked him if he had a bad dream and he said no I really saw something scary in the room. It was a big kid with a dark shadow walking around I ran right past him to get here.

I knew I checked the room before we went to sleep and figured it was his imagination and we went back to sleep.

Then 3am my Wife sat up frantically looking around and I asked what's the matter. She said someone yelled "mom!" You honestly didn't hear that? I told her no I didn't then she asked me to go check on our daughter.

I got to the kids bunk bed den in the next room and found her out of bed bundled up in the corner hyperventilating and full of tears. I swooped her up and she started saying be careful Dad he's still in here! I ran her back to our room and laid her on our bed with my wife and started searching the whole place.

I turned all the lights on and checked literally everywhere and there was no one. The doors were untouched, locks still in place, and windows unable to open. Honestly I was feeling the walls and mirror looking for hidden doors.

I asked my daughter what she saw and she said she was laying on the top bunk and thought at first it was me walking towards their bunk bed but as I got closer she realized it wasn't me. She said this person was taller and skinner then me. It also had smooth white skin and a neck longer then a normal person. It's skin was paper white, smooth, and looked naked but wasn't naked. It didn't appear to have much facial features.

I asked if maybe it was a blanket and she said no it's skin was smooth without wrinkles and it walked straight up to me and I covered myself. Then I watched it walk towards the door where your room is.

I came down the bunk when it walked away and peeked out the den window but saw it still walking towards your room. So I hid in the corner you found me and I tried to stay quiet so it wouldn't hear me because I thought it would kill me. But I started panicking and couldn't breathe good trying to be quiet. I was thinking of running out the front door into the hallway.

My Wife asked our daughter if she was trying to be quite why did she yell Mom? Our daughter said no I never said anything because I didn't want it to hear me and kill me. I didn't even hear our daughter say anything besides her hyperventilating as I got close to the bunk beds. I told my daughter to not mention what she had saw to our son even after he tells us what he saw when he wakes up. I know he would be spooked if he found out his sister had a similar encounter a few hours after him.

Both of our kids consistently sleep in there own rooms since they were little and have never ran into our room in the middle of the night unless our son had a rare bathroom accident.

At this point we figured the kids room was sketchy so we kept them with us, then closed and locked our room from that room. It took an hour for my wife to fall back asleep. I was honestly spooked by this whole thing so I left the hallway light on and figured I'd just keep watch and stay awake till daylight.

After she fell back asleep the closet light I left on turned off and wouldn't let me turn it on so I turned the bathroom light on. A little later I heard loud knocking on the conjoining room door I had locked. I honestly got goose bumps and tried to convince myself it was coming from the front door but knew it was from the conjoining door. I debated whether to ignore it or check. I felt vulnerable laying down without checking so I went and checked and there was nothing just an empty room luckily still with the lights on.

Half an hour later my Wife still asleep started freaking out in her sleep. She appeared to be having a night terror which she has had before (1-2 times per year in past) I woke her up and she was frantic. She stood up and said she dreamt she woke up from a dream in the same bed, she went to the bathroom in our room, came out, and ended up being stuck in the other room locked in with the evil entity. She said I had her locked in the other room and she was knocking like crazy in her dream trying to get back in on our side before the entity got her.

Later in the morning our son woke up and we asked him to describe what he saw. He said he saw what looked like shape of a big tall kid with a long neck that was white/gray in color and had a scary big dark shadow walking around the room. He said it was making weird noises like it was speaking words he didn't understand. He said it walked right up to him in the bed and had big eyes that glowed like our cats eyes look in the dark.

As the sun came out we got the courage to go into the other room and grab our belongings to leave. The last weird thing is the room had a weird smell which wasn't present there the day prior. It had smelt like a weird inscent was lit. Kind of reminded me of those stick inscents that were popular back in the 90's. We

So I personally didn't see this thing. But both of my kids (6 & 9) who have never had encounter like this saw same thing 3 hours apart from each other and had similar description of it without knowing each others description of it. The only thing that differed in their description was my daughter said it appeared faceless and my son said it had big glowy eyes and white/gray not just white. However my daughter covered herself when it got closer and my son watched it approach.

I did however witness 1: both of my kids having similar encounter. 2: my wife wake up to someone yelling "Mom!" 3: the light turn off and not turn back on. 4: Banging on the conjoining room door. 5: My wife have a night terror where she was locked in the other room banging on the door 30 mins after I heard banging on the door.

I've never really been a big believer on hauntings and paranormal stuff but after this I'm left questioning it in my head and find myself thinking about it all the time.
