I lost my parents very early. I didn’t even really get to know them. It was Uncle Manuel, my mother’s brother, who raised me—as a father would. We lived in a simple house, isolated, at the end of a dirt road, on the edge of a dry little forest in the countryside of Durango.

When I started college, I left that place behind with a heavy heart, but full of plans. I came back that first vacation. After that, life pulled me in other directions. Visits turned into phone calls. Then, not even that.

Twenty years passed. And I only returned now, to bury the man who loved me like a son. Uncle Manuel was laid to rest in the town cemetery, close to my parents' graves, behind the chapel.

I was alone after everyone left, staring at his name written crookedly on a wooden cross still damp from the rain. That’s when I heard soft footsteps behind me.
— “I thought it was you…” — said a familiar voice.
I turned. It was Camila.
My heart stopped for a second. She had been my whole world as a teenager. Now she was standing there, with faint wrinkles around her eyes, but the same smile. We talked under the overcast sky, reminiscing about things I thought I had buried along with my school years. When she said goodbye, she told me her husband was waiting by the cemetery’s crucifix. I watched as she walked away and disappeared behind the gravestones.

I went back to the house with a melancholy I couldn’t explain. The structure was still standing, but everything inside felt smaller than I remembered. I felt like a stranger among the furniture that had watched me grow up.

That first night, I barely slept. The wind rattled the shutters, and around two in the morning, I heard noises coming from the woods. I grabbed an old flashlight and stepped outside. The rain hadn’t started yet, but the air was already heavy.

I circled the house. Broken branches, trampled leaves—but no one there. When I came back inside, I stood at the door for a while. I felt something watching me from the dark.
The next morning, I found footprints near the kitchen window. Barefoot. Small. Like a woman’s. And I knew they weren’t mine.

The second night brought cold and a light, rhythmic rain tapping on the roof. I was sitting in the living room, unable to focus on anything, when I heard soft knocks on the front door.
I opened it.
Camila was there, wet from the rain, her hair stuck to her face. Her wet clothes clung to her curves.
— “Can I come in?” — she asked softly.
I was confused. I looked toward the road, but didn’t see any car.
— “Camila… what are you doing here?”
— “I came to see how you’re doing… after everything. You looked so lonely at the cemetery.”
Something felt wrong. Her gaze was glazed, unblinking. And she was trembling—not just from the cold, but as if she were struggling to hold herself together.
Even so, I let her in.

She walked in like she knew every inch of that house. I went to the bedroom, got a towel, and handed it to her. After drying off, she sat on the couch and crossed her legs. She spoke softly, like she used to when we were teenagers. But something about the way she looked at me felt distant, like she was studying me. It unsettled me, but I didn’t show it.
— “Where’s your husband?” — I asked, trying to stay rational.
She smiled.
— “What husband?”
— “Yesterday… you told me you were married.”
She didn’t answer. Just tilted her head, as if trying to understand why I’d said that. Then she slowly got up and walked toward me.
— “It doesn’t matter. I’m here now. That’s what matters, right?”

She got too close. When her face neared mine, I smelled her scent. It was both familiar and strange, like a perfume frozen in time. A smell that didn’t come only from her, but from everything we had lived—and left unfinished.
Her touch stirred something I thought I’d buried long ago. A forgotten warmth, a memory tucked deep inside. For a moment, time stopped—and there I was, without the shields of age, without the weight of the years, just a man in front of a feeling that had never fully died.

The night closed in around us, silent. The sound of the rain, the wind shaking the trees in the woods—everything felt far away. Inside the house, only her presence remained, and a void slowly being filled, as if we were picking up something left behind long ago.

There was no rush, no words. Just a silent, almost sad understanding that we both carried too many scars. And for a moment—a single moment—it was as if everything had fallen back into place.

Later, when I got up to get a glass of water, I noticed I was alone in the bedroom. I searched the house, and when I checked the living room, the front door was open. She had left before sunrise. That confused me. Maybe she needed to get back before her husband noticed.

In the morning, I went to the village to ask about Camila. I found her aunt in a religious goods store. When I mentioned her name, the woman’s eyes widened.
— “She died three years ago. Car accident. She was buried right here.”
I felt the ground slip beneath me, like I’d stepped wrong. A buzzing filled my ears, and for a moment, I couldn’t speak. I just nodded, like someone who already knew—though I didn’t know a thing.

I thanked her with a faint nod and left the store. Outside, the sun barely pierced the low clouds. I sat on a bench in the square and stared into nothing, trying to untangle the thoughts swirling around like leaves in the wind.
Her voice still echoed in my head—the touch, the look from the night before… So vivid, so real. Was it all a dream?

I don’t know who—or what—knocked on my door that night. I only know it came back. Three nights later.

I didn’t hear knocking this time. I just woke up with the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I opened my eyes slowly, afraid of what I might see. And there she was.
Standing at the bedroom door, her face half-hidden in shadow. But it wasn’t Camila’s face. Not really. It was… almost. Like someone had tried to sculpt a copy in a hurry, forgetting important details. One eye slightly higher than the other. The chin oddly long.
— “You left me outside,” she said, emotionless.
I tried to scream, but no sound came out. My body wouldn’t move. My heart pounded as she walked toward the bed, dragging her feet like she’d forgotten how to walk.
— “I waited so long for you,” she whispered, and climbed into bed with an animal-like movement.
I closed my eyes and wished it would all go away.

When I woke up, I was alone. The sun was shining through the window, and the sheets were in disarray. My whole body ached. In the bathroom mirror, I saw marks on my neck. Like claw marks.
There was no denying it anymore. That wasn’t a dream. It was real. A presence.

The next night, I slept with the door blocked by a chair, a kitchen knife in hand, and the lights on. But even with all that… I woke up with her lying next to me.

She moved toward me. When her face neared mine, I smelled it—that stench. Like rotting flesh left out in the sun. I jumped out of bed. She grabbed my arm with terrifying strength.
— “I waited for you,” she whispered, her mouth close to my ear. “I waited twenty years.”
I yanked myself free and ran to my uncle’s old room, locking the door behind me. On the other side—silence. I waited… minutes. Hours. When I finally got the courage to step out, the house was empty. The front door was open. Outside, no footprints. No sign anyone had been there.

By morning, my eyes were burning. I hadn’t slept. I decided to flee, pack my things, leave that place. Otherwise, I might not get out of here alive.
