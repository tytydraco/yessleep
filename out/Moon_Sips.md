My memory is a blurry, muddy hole. I can reach inside and grab around for the hard bits, the moments that I’m able to recall with confidence. It’s painful to do so, like I’m clawing around in my own intestines, rummaging for slop I digested long ago. But today, I’ll be persistent. 

Those first moments were pure bliss. What led us there, to the house, Alice and I, might have been a phone call. It might have been an email. No matter. The place was *ours*. It was an unassuming cottage, covered in ivy, parts of its roof sinking in. Humongous evergreen trees crowded around it like gigantic swaying obelisks of green, hugging the house like it was a warm hearth. The wind was constantly gusting, and the obelisks were always moving. 

James, the observant toddler that he was, liked them very much. “It’s like our own little army. Ready to do our bidding. Go trees! Fight them all!” Alice jumped next to him and twirled, the hem of her sundress twirling along with her. James rotated in a lunge, shoving his arm out and upward into the soggy summer air, pointing at the obelisks like a commander. 

I smiled at my family and felt like I meant it. That was a shiny new feeling, fresh as a ripe lemon. We locked arms and walked inside, suitcases in our free hands, all our belongings rattling inside them up the little steps to the door. The house was small, thin, and long, like the pill box my grandmother used to use. Oh, those pills. There were so many. My grubby little boy hands grabbed for them when she wasn’t looking and I stuffed them in my mouth, chomping down on them like candy. I wanted to feel what she felt. Wanted to know what sickness felt like. I found out, in a roundabout way. Those pills weren’t good for me. No sirree. 

The second I stepped across that threshold, I felt like I had just stuffed myself with those pills. That sinking feeling that something wasn’t right. It was probably the darkness, all the neglected web-filled corners crying out for someone to pay them attention. There were many of them, each room less maintained than the last, and there was a distinct lack of windows. It wasn’t like this when we last saw it, not at all. The small blonde owner — who looked quite like Alice, mind you — was chit-chatting away in her sing-songy voice during our tour. I must not have noticed.

“We can add a window,” I said. My insides grumbled. 

James squealed. “Window, window, window!” 

“There’s just one, back here in the kitchen,” Alice said. She looked more beautiful than ever. Light came through the large bay window behind the sink and landed like a feather on every angle of her face, caressing those classic sharp features I had fallen in love with at one time, deep in our pasts. The pill-feeling was long gone. James tugged my pant leg and asked to be put up on the counter. He sat there swinging his legs and singing. 

“*Moon sip, moon sip, hush at night*  

*Big hands sleep till day is bright*  

*Music smiles as phantom creeps*  

*Moon sip, moon sip, hush at night*”

I had never heard that one. He sang it in the style of “Rain, Rain, Go Away,” and I didn’t like it much at all. 

“Where did you learn a word like phantom?” I asked. 

“Moon sips, daddy. Moon petals. The little things you took.”

“What? You—”

The shrill clang of our doorbell interrupted my answer. 

“No one knows we’re here,” Alice said, putting her hand on my cheek.

“No one at all,” I said, withdrawing my hand from hers. 

Again it rang out. It cried long and loud, as if the ringer was trying their very hardest to push their finger through the button and into the house itself. I had no choice, really. My curiosity had to be satisfied. I strolled over and opened the door.

An incredibly tall and impossibly slender woman stood there. A comically large oval-shaped hat tilted downward to cover one of her eyes. She wore a black and white-striped suit that was draped over her as though hung on a coat stand. A large black-covered book sat open in one spindly hand, and a golden-tipped fountain pen sat hovering in the other. 

“Mr. and Mrs. Childress?” she asked without looking up. Her voice was just as pointy as she was. 

“That’s us,” I replied.

“I’m here with The Committee.”

“Who now?”

“The Committee.”

“What might that be?”

“I’m certain the previous owner informed you we’d be arriving promptly for a post-move-in inspection of the property?” She tapped the pen on the book. 

“I don’t remember any mention of a committee, miss…”

“*Mrs*. Bell.” She lifted her chin. “No matter. It’s mandatory.”

“It’s mandatory to let you into our home?”

“Precisely. And not just me. The rest of my team will enter as well. They should be done with their exterior inspection right about…” She leaned back and looked both ways. “...now.”

My own front door slammed into me, tossing me to the ground, my vision inaccessible from the sudden presence of an extremely bright light, my hearing assaulted by an ugly cacophony of clangs and bangs. 

Two large men — both in matching black suits — had joined the woman in the middle of what was to be the living room, appearing as if from nowhere. Various devices were on the ground behind them, littering our floor, which was empty just seconds before. A record player sat next to the fatter of the two men. Mrs. Bell stepped over it, the bottom of her heel marked with some kind of circular insignia I didn’t recognize. She no longer carried the book; instead, a wide ribbed tube sat in her hands, its tail extending back outside. 

Alice appeared in the archway leading to the kitchen with James in her arms, her hands covering his ears. 

“You must be the mother of the house!” Bell set down the tube and looked Alice up and down before centering upon James. “Who’s this little one?”

My wife, bless her, didn’t answer. James’s wide eyes took in the scary woman and her two henchmen as though they were three of the Four Horsemen — a judgment I shared.

“Come now, come now,” she urged, her voice a gentle but firm melody. “Let’s not get off on the wrong foot, shall we?” She turned and pointed her pen at me. “If you would prefer my friends here don’t restrain and inject, it’s best you speak only when spoken to, and answer all of my questions to the best of your abilities.” 

Bell took an unnaturally wide step closer to Alice. 

“Now, again. Who is the little one?”

“His name is James,” Alice answered, in the smallest voice I’d ever heard come out of her mouth. 

Bell eyed her for another moment, then clapped. The other man, a nasty scar across from his right ear down to the corner of his mouth, deposited the book back into her hands. She flipped through it with blazing speed. After a few moments, she stopped, made a mark with her pen, and looked back up. 

“That will do just fine.” She whipped back around to me, let out a sigh, and smiled. “Now you may take us down to the basement.”

The words came tumbling out of me before I could harness them. “You’ve *got* to be kidding. You came barging in here, practically ripped the door out of the wall, scuffed up our floors with…” I gestured to the gathering of evil-looking paraphernalia, “… whatever all of this is, and ask for a basement, which there isn’t one, given this is a *rancher…*” 

She took another gigantic step towards me, defying a few of the laws of the human body. “I’ll stop you right there. There is in fact a basement, and if you aren’t going to help us find it, one of my friends will gladly do the deed.”

“Hold on–”

“*And…”* she was inches away from me. I could smell her. A sickly combination of dried blood, burnt hair, and red velvet ice cream. “… if you insist on being churlish, perhaps this will convince you.” She paused, pupils flickering. “Jonathan David Fleury. 32 years of age. Father never around, mother died quite young, grandmother perished afterward from the grief. Sound familiar?”

“What are you…”

“You formed into a horrible kleptomaniac as you grew older, the weakness of your frontal lobe no doubt due to the lack of proper parenting. The warden of your orphanage managed to beat it out of you once and for all when she caught you stealing her precious family heirloom, a crime which you attempted to defend by claiming your long-dead grandmother had a tiara that looked just like it–”

 My blood boiled. I felt it burning beneath my skin. It made me yell. “ALRIGHT! ENOUGH!”

She looked positively smug. 

“If you already know all of that,” I stammered through gritted teeth, “why did you need to ask my son’s name?”

A wink flashed on her single visible eye. 

“You’ll see, curious Jonathan. The basement has been found.”

Her hand clamped down on my arm, dragging me with no apparent effort into the hallway toward the bedrooms. She grabbed Alice too. James cried. 

In the wall across from the half-bath was now a gaping hole, a sledgehammer sitting on the ground amongst remnants of the wall. Somehow, we hadn’t heard its use. The fatter of the two men was already making his way down the stairs, holding the large flashlight that blinded me. The scarred one grabbed James from Alice. I tried to cry out, escape the invisible hold on me, rip these strangers to shreds for daring to touch them, but my well of willpower was empty. Her hand drained me of something vital. 

The basement, which had not appeared on any of the photocopied floor plans, was square and unfinished. There was a break in the topography of the dirt floor, the four corners of the room sloping inward and downward, coalescing in a flat slab of ground in the middle. Black mold crawled up the walls. Many-legged critters scattered into prominent hidey-holes as the light touched them. The sight of it unsettled me, the feeling of not-right-ness even stronger than before. 

Mrs. Bell led Alice and me to chairs the henchmen had unfolded for us. I stole a look at her as we sat down, and to my dismay, I saw my wife also looked empty. She was biting the insides of her lips to shreds, her classic tick of anxiety, and I did the same. I wanted to place my hand on her thigh and rub it ever so gently, but my limbs were not responding. Ropes dug into my wrists and ankles, and an unbreakable stupor overcame me. 

I was alert enough to see another woman being led down the stairs, a small blonde woman, one who looked remarkably like Alice. Mrs. Bell leaned down before us and spoke through an unnaturally wide, pearly-perfect smile. 

“You’ll remember Miss Beatrice, the previous owner of this cursed homestead that we are now all a party to.” She grabbed the poor woman by the shoulders and wrenched her in front of us, as if she was a hunk of meat. “And Miss Beatrice, you’ll remember the poor sods you swindled. The Childresses.”

Catherine Beatrice. The lovely woman we had bought the house from, forms signed and money exchanged at a location far away. Yes, I remembered her. What exactly was she doing here? Whatever the reason, she looked positively frightened of it. 

“Please,” Catherine squeaked, hands clasped together in pleading. “Please, just listen to them. I’m sorry I dragged you into this, but it was my only chance. They said there was no other way. They said…”

Mrs. Bell picked her straight off the floor and sat her down in another chair to my right. “That’s quite enough, dearie. I’ll be doing the talking.” She turned to her henchmen. “Now, number four and six, are we ready? Roll the playbook for B5692.”

The two men had split the long ribbed tube into two and deposited it at both corners of the floor depression. A bizarre collection of trinkets was evenly spaced around the square area: a single cracked bronze hand mirror, a family of five clay idols (all with twisted, faceless heads), seven bundles of human hair, and nine candles with dark wax. The fat man held a pole with a thick net at the end. The one with the scar knelt down next to the record player, dusty vinyl in place. They nodded in unison, both apparently still refusing to speak.  

“Turn it all on,” Mrs. Bell whispered, licking her lips. 

A whirring sound enveloped the room. The tubes vibrated aggressively, sucking out whatever material covered the depression. It unfurled like scales being ripped off of an animal, the tubes jumping and jostling as the material disintegrated. The first pockets revealed a dark bunker beneath. A pure pit of blackness. The three strangers simply watched and waited like they had seen this nonsensical series of events occur a thousand times over. 

Eventually, the incessant whirring ceased and the pit was completely open. The room was significantly colder now. My breath hung in front of my nose, and goosebumps tickled my skin. A scent of copper sat in the air. 

“It now feels appropriate to tell you that there is a demon in your basement,” Mrs. Bell said, in the same tone one might use to describe the sky as blue. 

My voice felt like gravel under a wheelbarrow. “Excuse me?”

“Miss Beatrice is already aware of this, of course. Aren’t you dear?”

She appeared to be aware of it. If she’d have hugged herself any harder, organs would’ve burst out of her. 

“Yes, Catherine’s little daughter Mary was taken not long ago,” Mrs. Bell said, as she strode around the pit, stepping over the trinkets with her heels. “An unfortunate situation, to be sure. It’s not a common action with this type.” She flipped through the black book and made another mark. “And yet, poor little Mary must have stumbled upon the outside entrance into the basement. Tunnel hadn’t been properly filled. She waltzed in here and sat right on top of its sanctuary, I suspect. Wrong place, wrong time.”

“Please get her out, Bell!” Catherine cried. “You promised you would. I’ll do anything. Anything…”

“And you tried to bargain with it on your own, you curious little mouse. You got it so riled up with the tender way you pleaded for your daughter, it popped up on our radar. We hadn’t seen one like this in many years. I dare say my predecessor hadn’t even—”

“Why is my child here at all?” Alice interjected. Her eyes were flaming. “You need to answer our questions if you want us to cooperate, you sick-”

“Keep your emotion to a minimum,” Mrs. Bell snapped. “It will feed on your fear.” She turned and pointed. “Six, start the music.”

The vinyl played a muffled rendition of Duke Ellington’s “Take the ‘A’ Train.” The happy skips of jazz piano shocked me awake from the stupor, not because of the odd contrast, but because I recognized it. The same damn song was playing when I found her dead in her bed, the record repeating my grandmother’s favorite tune to her dead ears for who knows how long before I stopped it. 

“It should emerge any second,” Mrs. Bell said. “It will pick a target out of you two, Alice and Jonathan. Just know, if it picks you, there’s no telling what you’ll see or hear. The trick with B5692 is allowing it to hold you for long enough until we, The Committee, can offer it the deal.”

“Deal?” I asked, trying to wrangle my heart from slamming my chest open. “What kind of deal? Tell us—”

A shape appeared inside the pit, forming out of the darkness. It looked like a small human girl. Short blonde hair, cut into a bob, and navy blue overalls with little red sneakers. It sat there, legs crossed on the floor, and stared directly at me. The eyes were not blinking. 

“Do…do you all see this?” I turned to Alice, but she was looking around the pit, searching. Catherine had the same expression. 

“We see nothing, Jonathan,” Mrs. Bell said. “That means it chose you. Stay composed. Don’t make any sudden movements.”

“What does it look like?” Catherine whispered, her teeth chattering from the cold. 

“It’s…a little girl,” I murmured. “Wearing overalls. Blonde hair. She’s looking right at me.”

“Mary,” Catherine said, desperate. “Mary! That’s Mary. Is she okay? Does she look okay?”

The little girl gave me a closed-mouth smile, the corners of its mouth slowly creeping outward and upward. It got to its feet, its body moving to accommodate the change in stance, but its head stayed locked in place. 

One foot stepped in front of the other. The jazz was still playing, but I began to hear a clock tick inside of it. With each step, a tick. 

Step, tick…step, tick…She was going in a circle. Skipping. 

The head. No matter which way she faced, no matter which way she turned, the head still locked onto me. The impossible contortions of the neck were sickeningly hypnotic, to watch her go around and around…

Then her face subtly shifted. She looked less like a little girl, and more like an older woman. Then she had glasses, my grandmother’s glasses, and suddenly I was looking at my grandmother’s face oscillating around the pit, head still impassively fixed. Her mouth was opening and closing like a twisted aperture, whispering something. I leaned closer to hear…I had to hear it. “Moon sip, moon sip, he says they bring him to the moon, up high, up high…” 

It stopped in its tracks, body facing the other way, neck broken in twists, eyes wide. “Jonathan, my sweet,” the mouth said, just like she had said it…

I was no longer in the basement. I was in her room, walking toward her bed again, the song still playing, the large red alarm clock on the night table ticking along like a metronome. Her pills overflowed from the box on the night table. I remembered how she looked in the bed, despite the silk curtains on the canopy covering the body. The way the space between them opened and closed from the gust of wind coming in the open window, the space where I first glimpsed her legs, still like stone. 

I grabbed the curtain again, peeling it away. She was lying there, just as I remembered it, the pain returning with the sight of her. But, no…her eyes were moving, eyelids unsticking, like her pupils were butterflies emerging from their cocoons.

She was alive.   

She whispered something, so quietly I had to lean in to hear it over the music. The ticks of the clock got louder and louder the closer I leaned in…

“Keep me company, Jonathan…”

Then her hand was there in front of me, asking me to grab it. 

And god dammit, I grabbed it. 

Oh, did she ever smile. 

I almost smiled too. But Alice was suddenly there on the opposite side of the bed, body limp and hanging in the curtain, her blood soaking through the silk. I tried to remove my hand, to get her down, to save her, but my grandmother wouldn’t let go; pills fell out of her mouth now, an ocean of them, and she was laughing, all the music gone, and all I could hear was the clock ticking…

Then it was all over. The bedroom was gone. I wasn’t in the chair. Neither was Alice. I was below the basement, in the pit, looking upwards at Mrs. Bell. Alice’s dead body lay in the darkness next to me, the blood pooling around her. 

Mrs. Bell made another mark in her black book and smiled at Catherine, who held little Mary and James’s hands. The two men had packed up all their supplies and stood by the stairs, ready to go.

“Rare you get a two-fer-one,” the fat man said. “I figured it’d latch onto the kid.”

“Never seen it happen so quick,” the scarred one replied. “Guy must’ve had somethin’ it liked.”

“Now, now, boys. Let’s be respectful,” Mrs. Bell cooed. “I had it clocked from the start after all. Run the cursed dirt back in through the tubes. Let’s pack this baby up *tight.”*

I tried to speak. But the air down here drinks in every sound. When the whirring stopped, cursed covering restored, the darkness was absolute. A lid on a coffin. 

Time rots down here in the dark, but the incessant ticking continues, never reaching the next minute. The being in the room has kept me alive. I can no longer picture James’s little squealing face. Alice isn’t even here to help me. It’s been so long since her body sank into the floor. Sometimes the demon rearranges her bones for sport. It lets me watch.

I used to beg. Now I rehearse. *Moon sip, moon sip*, I murmur along with it, perfecting our lullaby with every tick. 

Together, we yearn for a new little companion to move in above us soon, someone we can invite inside our room and join us. 

Someone whose parents would call The Committee. 

We’ll be waiting for them.
