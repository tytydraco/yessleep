**June 28**

\[…\] Nearly three weeks have passed since the three men disappeared. Unfortunately, they weren’t the last. Helen Roscoe and Peter O’Donnell both disappeared on the same day, June 12. Miss Davenport followed her husband on June 14. The school has no teachers left. Not that it matters much now, no one sends their children to school anymore. Janice Porter and Evan McCarthy, a young couple, simply vanished on the open street while they were walking past Jack Galloway. Jack said he turned around after they passed him, just for a tiny moment, but they were nowhere to be seen. The strange thing is, no one really sees how all these people, our friends, disappear. It just happens. From one moment to the next, as if erased from the face of the earth.

Emory Knox, on the other hand, had an experience again a week ago, this time that everyone could witness. He tripped on his way to church and froze mid-fall. For exactly 17 minutes, he hung suspended in mid-air until he thawed and fell to the ground. Again, he had no memory of it. \[…\]

The shadows of Nate Klein, Evelyn O’Donnell, and Hannah Granger have disappeared in the past few days. I fear I know what will happen to them next.

**July 2**

\[…\] The worst part is the helplessness. We can only watch and come to terms with what will happen. We don’t know which “symptoms” (for lack of a better word) will appear in whom, how long it will take before the person disappears, or what will happen to them. Of course, we all suspect the two figures behind it (never have more than two been seen at once), but even though we blame them, we have no clue how or why these events are happening. We have no idea who or what the figures are, where they come from, or what they want. We know nothing. That makes waiting for the next symptoms that much more bearable, and as soon as someone’s shadow disappears or it seems like they’re saying or experiencing something strange, we already know something is about to happen to them. The town is full of living dead, if you look at it from that perspective. At least if the general assumption is correct that the disappeared ones are dead, because we don’t really know that for sure. Our ignorance also makes any attempt to form a plan nearly pointless, since we don’t even know how to stop or cure the symptoms, let alone what will happen next. Because things happen so randomly and irregularly that no pattern can be detected. \[…\]

People only go out on the streets for essentials, and even then, they rush through their errands. Some, like Jack Galloway, mumble strange things as they walk down the streets. Others you hardly see anymore, and only the light turning on and off in their houses lets us know they’re still there. \[…\]

**July 4**

\[…\] I see the beings every day now too. The thicker the fog gets, the closer they come to the edge of town. Hannah Granger, whose husband Howard owns the gas station on the far outskirts of town, has been standing at one of the pumps for two days now, just staring blankly at the northern hill. No one sees any of the figures there. But Hannah hasn’t moved from the spot for two days, and she hasn’t spoken. She just stands there, watching the hill. Howard is desperate. He tried to carry his wife inside, but without success. She won’t move. I think he knows there’s no saving Hannah anymore. He should make peace with it. \[…\]

**July 6**

Pastor Whitfield gave a strange sermon today. He says that beings spoke to him and showed him the way to paradise. He saw their beauty, heard their warm words, and felt their desire for him. He said that the beings are entirely unknown to us, but they know each and every one of us very well. I think I understand what he means, even though he speaks very metaphorically. Deborah Klein had tears in her eyes as she listened to him and shouted that her husband Nate had said the same thing before he left this morning. \[...\]

**July 8**

After Nate Klein, the other two shadowless have disappeared. Hannah Granger was simply no longer at the pump this morning, where she had been motionless for the past few days. Howard is devastated. Deborah Klein told him to rejoice for his wife, just as she had rejoiced for her husband Nate, that he had found the way. I don’t know where Deborah gets that enthusiasm from. The rest of us remain disturbed and frightened. \[...\]

And finally, Evelyn is gone. Young Stanley Wittaker, who saw her on the street from his window at night, tried to talk to her and convince her to come inside. But she only told him that she had to go to her husband, who was calling her. \[...\]

Aaron and Joanne aren't talking to me anymore. I haven’t seen them for days. They’ve drawn their curtains. I’m scared for them, but at least the light in their house proves that they are still there.

**July 10**

They have them. My best friend and his wife. Aaron and Joanne, both gone. I saw them one last time. They were walking across their field towards the forest, toward the two figures barely visible between the two trees. Voluntarily. No calling, no pleading could make them notice me. They just walked into the forest. \[...\]

Owen Harlow, Martin Harlow’s son, said that their phone rang today. Of course, no phone has rung in Dunn’s Creek for weeks. The connection was bad, but he clearly heard a voice on the other end that sounded familiar, but he couldn’t place it. \[...\]

The sisters Sylvia and Tina Klein, Nate and Deborah’s daughters, walked past the church today and also observed something strange. Apparently, the bells in the church tower rang, but they made no sound. Instead, the two felt vibrations in their heads. I don’t know what’s real anymore...

**July 17**

Despite our protests, the Mercers decided to leave their grocery store and follow the Finnigans’ example and flee the town. I tried to convince Eliot personally, but the old fool has always done whatever he set his mind to. Linda was very quiet and scared. I can’t blame her. We are all scared. Actually, I don’t even know why we tried to talk Eliot out of it, because people are disappearing here one by one anyway. During our discussion, I saw one of the beings in the shadows behind the grocery store.

They plan to leave tomorrow morning. I hope they make it.

**July 18**

Eliot and Linda left this morning. I saw them off personally and watched them leave the town. No figures in the fog. Their car has been parked in the driveway for an hour, but there is no sign of them. \[...\]

I trust no one anymore. Since Aaron left last week, I haven’t talked much with anyone. He was the only person I still trusted. Before all this, everyone knew each other, everyone got along. We didn’t even have to lock our doors at night. Now, trust is a luxury that no one can afford here. Paranoia dominates our lives in Dunn’s Creek. Linda Harlow is desperate because her phone hasn’t stopped ringing. No one else has noticed except for her and her son. Yesterday, Linda screamed into the phone until Pastor Whitfield, her neighbor, came to her. He said no one was on the other end of the line, but Linda had threatened him when he tried to hang up. \[...\]

**July 22**

Most of the citizens are now gone. We’re about 50 left. My research in the library about the nature of these occurrences has been unsuccessful. This, of course, also makes it impossible to come up with a plan to save the remaining people in Dunn’s Creek. As far as we can tell, we’re at the mercy of fate, and there’s no hope we could change anything. And we know that nothing of this will ever reach the outside world. Every escape attempt, every distress signal, and every plan for our rescue has failed, and we don’t even know why. Everything is so unpredictable; every time we think we see a pattern, something completely new and unexpected happens \[...\]

Sheriff Caldwell is dragging himself through the fog, looking for something that might help us, but of course, he finds nothing. He has dark circles under his eyes and loses his nerves over the smallest things. Ruth McAllister has been talking to her radio for days. Just like with the Harlows and their phone, nothing is heard, but the mayor behaves differently. She sits in a trance in front of her radio and talks to it urgently. I saw her today sitting on her porch and heard sentences like, “What do you mean, the blood shows it. The key is missing.” and “Yes, the candles went out, but since then, it’s only gotten brighter.” It seems as though she’s answering questions, but the answers are so incoherent and absurd that I can’t even imagine what the questions in this absurd game of Jeopardy might be...

**July 23**

Emory Knox is freezing more and more. Yesterday, he must have sat at the dining table for 117 minutes, with a spoonful of soup halfway to his mouth...

Sylvia and Tina have been standing in front of the church for days, trying to catch the bell ringing. Apparently, it only rings for them, but I can’t confirm that myself. Pastor Whitfield is encouraging them, he’s made peace with all this and I think he sees a divine plan in it. He tells them they’ll be ready soon. He seems happy. \[...\]

**July 24**

Sheriff Caldwell stormed into the Harlow house tonight. I suspect he was sneaking through the streets and passed their house, probably because Linda was on the phone again. I don’t know why, but something about that must have moved Tom to do what he did... Owen wasn’t even ten years old. It’s cruel, now we’re turning on each other, even though we’re all we have left. I, and Jacob Miller, brought the bodies of Linda and Owen to the cemetery. Sam and John took Tom to his office, where he apathetically let them take him and chained him to his desk with handcuffs. \[...\]

The pastor gave a little sermon for the two dead. He’s happy for them and called their death a blessing, as they were the ones who finally did what the rest of the town refuses to do. Marcus Kirkland stormed up to him a few minutes later and punched him in the face. I can understand him, the pastor isn’t himself anymore, and given the despair around here, his words are nothing but mockery. Marcus would probably have beaten Isaac to death if we hadn’t pulled him away from him. \[...\]

**July 25**

The sheriff is gone now too. Sam Barrows went to check on him today and see if he appeared coherent enough to be released. The door and windows were still locked, and the handcuffs were still fastened to the desk. The only difference was that there was no sheriff at the other end of the handcuffs. No blood or signs of how he could have freed himself. He disappeared from a locked room. But oddly, no one seems too surprised anymore. Too much has happened. We just accept the facts now, and everyone wonders how and when it will happen to them. No one has hope that things will turn around here anymore. The inevitability of our fate is the most terrifying, and at the same time, strangely comforting thought I’ve ever had. It's no longer a question of who will go, but how and when. There is no uncertainty about whether it will happen, because it’s certain that they will take us one by one. All we can do is hope it won’t hurt. \[...\]

**July 29**

\[...\] Who would have thought that the three boys would do something so foolish? Danny was never the brightest, I admit, but even he should have realized how hopeless their plan was. To just charge into the hills and threaten the beings with an axe—that wasn’t just a bad plan, it was downright stupid. At least Randy made it back, even though he lost his friends in the fog. We can still hear them calling, though more faintly each time, and always from a different direction. I could have sworn I heard Danny call behind me in the library, but of course, he wasn’t there. \[...\]

Since his return, Randy has strange markings and symbols on his back. I don’t recognize the language, of course I don’t. The symbols are completely foreign to me and to everyone else. \[...\]

I saw Sylvia and Tina walk into the church, where they’ve been standing for almost two weeks, trying to catch the bell ringing. They walked into the church calmly, but didn’t come out again. I asked Pastor Whitfield if he had seen them, since he hardly leaves the church anymore. He said the two never entered the church. So, they must have simply disappeared on the threshold.

**August 3**

Danny and Stan finally stopped calling out from the fog last night. Randy sneaked off last night and went to the North Hill, hoping to find his friends. John Harper watched him from his window. No one dares to follow Randy to try and save him. Why would they? It wouldn’t change anything. Anyway, Randy started calling out from the fog again this morning. We recognize his voice, but we can’t make out what he’s saying, because he’s speaking a language none of us have ever heard before. I suspect it’s the same language as the symbols on his back. \[...\]

Ruth scares me with the way she talks to her radio. I tried to get her away from it, but no chance. She keeps saying more and more disturbing things. She didn’t even look directly at me, even when I was only inches away and shouting at her. She just answered, “It’s not the trees that are moving. It’s the shadows pretending to be trees. You have to ask them properly before they show themselves.” \[...\]

**August 4**

\[...\] I don’t know if it’s just a coincidence, but honestly, I no longer believe in coincidences. Today, I noticed something that reminded me of what Mayor McAllister said to her radio yesterday. The beech trees in front of the town hall moved. I don’t mean swaying in the wind, I mean they’re gone. Similar to the way the path to the water tower disappeared. Now, looking toward the North Hill in the fog, I see the shadows of four new trees. Was that what the mayor meant by shadows pretending to be trees? \[...\]

**August 6**

\[...\] Now Randy has stopped calling out. I guess he found his friends. \[...\]

The beings were also seen by Emory in his basement. He rushed into the library to tell me about it, because it’s right across from his house. He said he saw both figures out of the corner of his eye. \[...\]

**August 10**

\[...\] Emory Knox froze one last time, but hasn’t appeared since. He’s been sitting motionless on his front wall for 32 hours. He was only in his house at night after he saw the silhouettes there. In his last movement, he seemed to nervously and fearfully look over his shoulder, at least that’s how I interpret his posture and expression. But we can’t get him to move, so we’ll probably just leave him there...

**August 12**

Howard Granger hanged himself. His son discovered him this morning. I guess since his wife was gone, it just became too much for him. Still, I curse that damn coward, he still had a nine-year-old son! Little Miles is staying with Mandy Glover now and is understandably completely disturbed. After Howard’s suicide, there are only a dozen of us left, three of whom are no longer coherent: Mayor McAllister, who won’t stop talking to her radio, Pastor Whitfield, who is unnervingly happy about the whole situation, and Sam Barrows from the tackle shop, who honestly never had it all together and is sticking to his conspiracy theories more than ever. There’s still one child left, Miles Granger. That leaves only eight, EIGHT adults left who are still in control of their minds, as far as I can tell. In less than half a year, an entire town has been erased, and no one knows why. I’ve given up looking for answers. I just expect my fate.

**August 21**

Pastor Whitfield has gotten the Kirklands wrapped up in his idea that everything happening in Dunn’s Creek is a divine test for us. The three of them spent the whole night in the church talking. This morning, we couldn’t find them anymore. The remaining survivors have formed new small groups. John Harper, Jacob Miller, and Sam Barrows have withdrawn to the former tackle shop. I suspect they’re drinking what’s left of Samuel O’Reiley’s whiskey, which hasn’t been replenished since his disappearance two months ago. Mandy Glover is keeping a close eye on Miles Granger. They no longer leave Mandy’s property. Shortly after Miles arrived with her, the two of them started behaving… in sync. It’s hard to explain, but it’s as if they were two separate parts of a single body. They walk in step, stop at the same time, turn their heads at the same time, and stand in exactly the same posture in Mandy’s garden, staring at the hill behind the gas station. It almost seems robotic, like a grotesque, unnatural choreography. \[...\]

I’ve stopped leaving the library. It doesn’t matter whether I’m here or at home, but here I at least have some distraction. I’ve actually started reading the Bible. It seems fitting. Maybe there is something divine about all of this. That thought is somewhat comforting, because it gives everything a purpose, even if it’s more abstract. \[...\]

**August 27**

If there was anything that kept me from losing my sanity, it’s now disappeared, just like Aaron, Joanne, the Mercers, the Kirklands, the Finnigans, and all the other poor souls who had to experience these last months. When I think about it, it almost feels like a miracle how long it took before something truly strange happened to me. Of course, I’ve seen the beings every day in the fog, out of the corner of my eye, and I’ve witnessed the strange things that happened to Emory Knox, Maggie Harper, Sylvia and Tina Klein, and everyone else, but there was still a certain distance between their experiences and my own sanity. But when you look out your window and notice that your reflection in the glass no longer follows your movements, but mimics you out of sync… To see your reflection suddenly grin widely, even though you’re anything but amused. To see it stare into your eyes and mock you with your sheer fear. To see it develop a life of its own… I’ve never seen anything that scared me more. \[...\]

I know how to interpret the signs. I can imagine what will come my way in the near future. \[...\]

**August 31**

\[...\] The mayor has settled in front of the library and hasn’t moved since yesterday. Instead, she keeps talking to her radio. I’ve started eavesdropping on her as best I can through the door, trying to avoid looking at my reflection in the glass, hoping to find some solution for all the unnatural phenomena that have plagued Dunn’s Creek. If it doesn’t lead to our salvation (because I doubt anything can save us), at least for the sake of answers. But her ramblings weren’t very enlightening. Here are some sentences I managed to overhear:

“No, no, the basement is no longer safe. It’s about the mirror…”  
“You see me now, don’t you? But I told you I don’t count anymore.”  
“The storm was like that too, remember? That was before the light went out and we gave up the sun.”

I don’t understand it. Ruth’s cryptic conversations with the beings (as I assume they are) make no sense without knowing the context. If there is any context. Maybe the mayor has just gone mad, I don’t know. I wouldn’t blame her, but it wouldn’t make a difference. \[...\]

My reflection, however, stares at me every time I see it. No matter what I do. It just stares or makes barely noticeable, strange movements that don’t match how my real body moves. Today was the first time I’ve had no reflection at all. It was simply gone. The next time I looked into the window, it was back, watching me.

**September 2**

I haven’t heard anything from the tackle shop down the street since the day before yesterday, and I haven’t seen any light there at night. I don’t know whether I should check to see if the three men are okay. I’m afraid to go outside, but I suspect that the three of them are gone now too. \[...\]

Mandy and Miles still walk absolutely in sync through the streets. The only person they sometimes run into is Ruth, who’s also wandering the streets, talking more and more frantically to her radio. Only four people left… And none of us can be saved.

Occasionally, I see the figures standing behind a corner at some distance. They’re still doing nothing. Just now, Ruth walked right past one of the beings but didn’t notice it. The being didn’t seem to take any notice of her either. \[...\]

**September 6**

It’s a strange sight when I look out the library window. Emory Knox has been sitting motionless on his wall across the street for weeks. Ruth, Mandy, and Miles pass by the library exactly every 17 minutes. They seem to have set routes in opposite directions. I’ve watched them as best as I could, without them noticing me. I don’t know which of the three scares me more. Actually, none of them are doing anything dangerous or threatening. \[...\]

Mandy and Miles continue to walk in perfect sync through the streets. Sometimes, they do something strange. For example, today, they stopped in front of the library when they met the mayor. The three of them stared at each other. Ruth pressed her radio to her chest, and Mandy and Miles tilted their heads at the same time, as though they were listening to someone. Then, the two of them suddenly turned toward each other and embraced with unnatural, jerky movements and waxy smiles. Then they all continued walking. It was like watching animatronics. There was nothing organic in their movements, no muscle movements or natural imperfections to be seen. \[...\]

**September 9**

\[…\] Today, I was able to eavesdrop on Ruth again, which only confirmed my suspicion that they are looking for me: "The mirror will find you, no matter how far you go. It knows you better than you know yourself." Mandy and Miles saw Ruth in front of the library about thirty minutes ago. She said something to her radio, and suddenly, all three of them stared directly at the window where I was standing. I quickly moved to the right of the window, out of their line of sight. Instead, I saw one of the figures on the roof across, just visible through the fog, barely recognizable as a silhouette. It too was staring into the window. \[…\]

**September 14**

For the past few hours, screams have been echoing from the darkness and fog. I can’t make them out clearly, but some of the voices sound strangely familiar. As if I were hearing a message from a loved one through a distorted speaker. They’re calling my name. But I don’t respond. When the screams started, the 17 minutes had just passed, and the last three survivors, if I can still call them that, all turned in the same direction. They stood like that for another 17 minutes until they suddenly sprinted into the fog. Their movements were unnatural, and the speed at which they ran was just as strange. I haven’t seen them since. I waited another 17 minutes, then 17 minutes more, and several more 17-minute intervals. But no one has passed by the library since. I’m now the only one left in Dunn’s Creek. Well, there’s still my reflection. At least sometimes. But since the three ran into the fog, I haven’t seen it. And Emory Knox, whom I can still faintly make out across the street, so dense is the fog now. Only the two beings randomly appear before my window, on the rooftops, in the houses and gardens, and on the street. Always just far enough in the fog that I can still vaguely see them. They still haven’t harmed me. They just stare through my window. I can feel it. \[…\]

My end is not far off. If it’s not my reflection, or the beings, or the fog that will come for me, then I will starve from the ever-diminishing rations. Right now, I still have three cans of beans, three jars of pickles, various bags of chips, and a few liters of water. Under these circumstances, I will only have a week to live, maybe more, maybe less. \[…\]

But what good would an escape do? The Finnigans, the Mercers, Emma Notte, they all tried to escape Dunn’s Creek, either by the roads or the hills. It did no good. The question now is whether I dare to take the smallest chance of survival and venture into the fog, where I can no longer even see my hand in front of my face, or whether I will cowardly stay here and wait for whatever will happen to me. \[…\]

**September 19**

I think I have to try. I’m going into the fog and will face the beings if I must. I don’t want to disappear without a fight. I’ve been fortunate to retain my sanity, so I intend to use it properly. The chances of success are low, but they’re even lower if I stay here. My rations are completely gone. The end is only days away anyway. \[…\]

I only see my reflection irregularly now. Today, I could have sworn it wasn’t a reflection anymore but had disappeared between two bookshelves. I looked directly to the right at the window and saw it there, grinning maliciously at me. The eyes have turned white, there are no more pupils. It seems to be getting closer. I wish I hadn’t looked into the window. \[…\]

So, I will go to the Mercers' store and see if I can find some water or food. Fortunately, Nigel’s weapons store is right across, so maybe there’s something there I can use to defend myself. Then, I’ll head south across country. The beings have mostly appeared on the hills, so I hope the river is a bit safer. \[…\]

In the hope that someone will find these pages, I’ve summarized the key points and left them in a manuscript. I hope no one ever gets lost in Dunn’s Creek, but if they do, at least they’ll know what happened here. With some luck, they will escape and spread the word. Although probably no one will believe what’s written here. \[…\]

I am ready. I found a few small rations; they might last me three days. The beings have been waiting behind every new corner for me, but I haven’t paid them any attention. I’m going into the fog now. The screams are still heard. The beings are still watching me. My reflection is watching me too. I think I’m ready. As ready as one can be when facing the unknown.

 

 

“Can we please just leave now?” The diary had taken its toll on Lara. The others no longer seemed quite as adventurous as they had before reading the manuscript. Steve still held it, eyeing it suspiciously.

“Yeah, I mean… shit, who writes something like that?” he asked. “This can’t be serious!”

“Of course not, what do you think?” Tommy responded, rolling his eyes. “Someone probably just wanted to scare people like us who were checking out this abandoned, creepy library.”

“I don’t know, it doesn’t sound like something someone just made up,” Dave said. “And remember the bell on the way here? The one in the church tower? It’s described exactly in the manuscript. And Emory Knox? The one frozen on the wall in front of the library? And the fog in the middle of the day in August?”

“What, are you saying you believe this crap?” Tommy mocked.

“Can we PLEASE just leave now?” Lara nearly screamed. “You’re right, let’s get out of here. This is a little creepy…”

“Yeah, I agree. It’s a bit unsettling…” Steve added.

Lara looked out the window. It had gotten darker faster than she thought. The group hurried to leave the library, and although Dave and Tommy put on brave faces, they weren’t keen on looking for the car in the middle of the night in an abandoned town.

When they stepped outside, they noticed the fog had thickened. They quickened their pace as they descended the sandstone stairs and crossed the small park. Lara made sure to ignore the statue, which hopefully wasn’t Emory Knox, as they passed by. On their way back to the car, which was parked on a patch of grass by the town’s water tower, Lara felt more and more watched. They shouldn’t have read the diary—it had been so creepy, and the mind plays strange tricks in situations like this. They should have just gone straight to the lake and left that creepy Lost Place behind.

Just as the fog grew even thicker and Lara feared they might not find the car, Dave hit the button on his key fob, and with a quick honk and a flash of headlights, they saw his car about a hundred meters away. Panting heavily, they ran toward it and jumped inside. Dave started the engine, turned around, and the group headed out of Dunn’s Creek.

“Shit, I’m so glad to be out of there!” Lara laughed loudly. The place had been creepy, but the diary, if it had indeed been real, was so authentically written that it felt like the absurd story might have actually happened. The group chatted for a while about what they had just read, concluding that the writer must have been an explorer who had noticed the broken bell and the statue on the wall and decided to have some fun.

In the cozy safety of the car, and since it was getting late, Lara closed her eyes for a moment, looking forward to arriving at the house by the lake.

About an hour and a half later, Lara yawned and asked, “Hey Steve, any idea how much longer we’ll be driving?”

Steve looked at the navigation app on his phone and replied, “Not far now, just a few more kilometers!”

Sure enough, after a few minutes, the forest began to thin, and they finally saw their destination. Dave parked the car by the roadside, and the group got out, stretching after the long drive. They stepped into the bright sunlight, finally free of the trees' shadows.

“Here we are—Dunn’s Creek!” Steve exclaimed.

“ The fog is a bit weird, though, especially in the middle of August. But I guess it adds to the vibe.he added.

“Yeah, sure. Really picturesque here,” Lara replied.
