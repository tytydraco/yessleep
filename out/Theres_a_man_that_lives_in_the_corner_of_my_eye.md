You know what I’m talking about, right? You're in the middle of work or doing something fun, and you get the strange feeling you're being watched, only to turn and see maybe a mere glimpse of a shadow of something before it disappears into the deepest nooks of your cornea. 

Yeah, in my case there’s a man. Well, I can’t actually prove there’s a man, but I know he’s there, watching me from where I can’t see. It’s like I can sense him watching me. Like when I’m alone, I’m not really…alone. It all started maybe about a month ago. 

I work in a school as a night shift janitor, usually from 2pm to 12am. Not the best job in the world, but hey, someone’s gotta do it. It’s not a hard job; it’s basically what you’d expect: cleaning off desks, sweeping up dust, and mopping up any poor kid’s regurgitated lunch. Like I said, not the best job. Anyways, it wasn’t a particularly exciting night, to say the least. I just did what I normally did on every other day I had work. I’d usually get up around noon after sleeping in for so long because of all the gaming I did the night before. Then I’d make myself breakfast—well, I guess it would technically be lunch? Doesn’t matter, I’d make myself cereal and coffee regardless. After that I’d get dressed in my work clothes, which is usually something I wouldn’t mind getting dirty. 

After that it’s about a long and painstaking 40-minute drive to the high school. I won’t say the high school’s real name for the sake of privacy, but let’s just call it Hillcrest High School. Before I continue, let me describe to you what type of school Hillcrest is, so you know what I deal with every day. You see, Hillcrest isn’t one of those normal suburban schools you find lying off the side of some random highway in a populated area that has a grand football field behind it packed with life every Friday night. It’s an old, quiet, poor, rundown school that doesn’t even have a football field or a football team for that matter. And when I say old, I mean old as shit, like built in the 1850s and placed in the middle of nowhere by an idiotic politician in charge of education. And trust me, it shows. Wonder why it takes me so long to get to work? Because there is no main highway that leads to it, just a beaten-down gravel road that stretches on for miles. The outside? A foundation that consists of nothing but crumbling red bricks used to replace the molding lumber underneath, smothered in decaying concrete, resting in a large open field that spans 1 or 2 long grassy, weed-filled, and insect-infested miles. The inside? Hallways filled with scuffed yellow (used to be white) tiles and thin paper drywall walls that make up every room. The dim white lights that flicker from time to time (which means I’ll have to replace them soon) wrap up the whole vibe and give the school a nice eerie, unsettling feeling as soon as you step foot into the building. Only about 100 to 200 people attend Hillcrest because really that’s the max capacity the school has space for. It’s not big in the slightest, and I’m surprised it’s still open, but I’m not complaining; the fewer kids, the easier my job is. 

I’d arrived at Hillcrest High School at around 2:30 that day. I remember the time clearly because I kept cursing myself for being late. I hurriedly jumped out of my car and headed inside to clock myself in; I couldn’t really afford to be a second later. I was never the best at showing up on time, but today I showed up a lot later than normal. I don’t know what it was, but I just didn’t want to be there. As I reached the entrance to Hillcrest, I put my hands on the dead cold handle of the steel door in front of me, the metallic surface stealing every ounce of warmth in my body. 

Swinging open the door, a gust of even colder ventilated air hit my body, making every hair stand up on its tippy toes. I took a deep breath before walking down the crooked halls and into the break room that looked like it was held together with a couple of glue sticks and hope. A familiar ding sounded off as I used my punch card (I told you the school was old) to clock in. Since the school was so small, it was relatively easy for one person to manage by themselves, so there was only one daytime janitor and one night time janitor. At this point it should only be me in the building by myself…it should’ve been anyways. Now I don’t remember the exact way these events went down, so I’ll break it down the best I can. 

3pm. There are only 3 hallways in Hillcrest High School: one hallway for freshmen and sophomores, one hallway for juniors and seniors, and finally one hallway for elective classes, you know, stuff like band and choir. You get the gist. I would normally start with the freshman and sophomore hallway and kind of work my way around to the others after. First I’d wipe down all furniture in each classroom, then I’d go back around and dust mop all the rooms, then spot mop any mess that was left behind by the kids, before finally taking out all the trash and leaving for the night. Easy but definitely time-consuming. 

5pm. Almost finished with the freshman/sophomore hallway now. It took about 2 hours, but I finally did it. Unfortunately for me, the freshmen/sophomores today decided to be unusually messy, throwing anything they could find on the floors, which is why it took me so long to clean up. They don’t normally do that; you wouldn’t expect a freshman/sophomore in high school to act like a 5th grader, but sure enough it happens. Pencils, folders, books, and even things from the teachers' desks were thrown on the floor, like it was done specifically to spite me. It’s never THIS bad; I even know the teachers of this hallway, and they’re super friendly, even picking up students’ things off the floor before I even get to it to help me out. So why was it so bad today? I shrugged it off, trying to just ignore the strange occurrence, but in the back of my mind a feeling of unease started to make itself comfortable. Better get back to cleaning so I can finish on time. 

7pm. Almost done with the junior/senior hallway; nothing strange to report there. In fact, there was barely anything to clean up at all. So I guess the freshman/sophomore was really just messy after all? I was pretty disappointed in the disrespectful way the teachers let their kids trash their rooms today. I get it’s my job to clean up messes, but they shouldn’t intentionally leave one; it’s just so rude, you know? It pisses me off. Anyways, I only have one room left in the junior/senior hallway, but I’ll be sure to have a little chat with the teachers in the morning. 

7:24pm. The sun is starting to set on the horizon, disappearing with a yellow and orange glow. While taking out the trash of the last room in the junior/senior hallway, I suddenly heard a loud BANG coming from the other side of the school in the hallway where the electives are held. Now don’t get me wrong, this scared the absolute crap out of me and made my stomach drop about 6 feet below, but I wasn’t exactly surprised either. Being the old school that Hillcrest is, there are many cracks and crevices for animals of many kinds, like birds, rats, raccoons, and even cats, to try and sneak their way in and wreak havoc on anything they could find. I remember a particular time where the biggest animal I’ve ever found in the school, a large dog, was jumping around in a classroom tearing up colored paper while managing to flip over multiple desks. It took awhile for me to get him out and even longer to clean up the mess he made, but eventually I did. I took a deep sigh of annoyance, knowing that whatever animal got in this time, I would have to get out again and hopefully not contract rabies. I loosened my shoulders and hung my head as I slowly dragged myself to the final hallway of the night where the animal was. I truly don’t get paid enough for this. 

8:32pm. At this point it’s completely dark outside, and I’ve checked every single room in the elective hallway for any sign of animals without luck, except for the band room. As I stand outside looking at its large steel doors covered in colorful sheet paper spelling out “BAND” with a little down tuba on the side, I gulp nervously, bracing myself for any type of creature to be behind these doors. I reach out for the handle, twisting the knobs and opening the large steel doors that give out a drawn-out shriek due to their rusty hinges. I then flicked the light switch, waiting for the delayed lights to flicker on with the same white hue that every other classroom has. “Just 3 and a half more hours; just gotta make it to 12,” I said, taking slow, cautious steps into the band room. 

You see, the way the band room is set up is like this. It’s an extremely large room, probably the biggest in the entire school; it has grey cracking concrete floors and very tall, thin white walls that reach towards the sky covered in soundproofing barriers. Across the dirty concrete floor rest a bunch of black desk chairs for students to sit in, as well as black music sheet stands sitting right in front of them. The music room is so big it also has narrow, small carpeted stairs that lead up to a balcony with several small noise-canceling rooms in the back of it for students' private practices. The rooms upstairs are no bigger than a closet and can only really hold one student at a time, but with 3 of those types of rooms up there, multiple students are able to practice at once. Although it’s nothing special, it’s probably where most of the funding went when building the school. 

As I took steps deeper into the band room, I noticed a large beige filing cabinet that had been tipped over on its side and was now resting in the middle of the floor, knocking over several chairs and stands on its way down. Great, it must be a pretty big animal then. I walk over to it and try to lift the filing cabinet back up, pulling at it with all my strength as I let out several grunts of struggle. I then stop trying to lift it as a sudden shocking realization hits me. Wait a minute…there's no way an animal could knock this thing over, even if it was big. This thing weighs at least over 200 pounds; a HUMAN could barely move this thing. How the hell did it fall over? My eyes then quickly survey the surrounding area and manage to wander up to the balcony. What I saw next made my soul nearly leap to hell from how scared I was. 

I only saw it for a split second before it disappeared from my sight, but I swear I saw two large, thin, shadowy legs disappear around the corner of one of the doors of the small open rooms upstairs on the balcony. “Holy shit,” I’d said to myself, frozen in fear. Great, so there’s a squatter in the school, and he’s hiding upstairs. What should I do? Should I call the police? It’s the most logical option, but there’s no way they’ll make it here in time. At this time of night in the middle of nowhere? This guy will be gone by the time they’re even halfwayhere. Should I just run? No, I can’t; the school would definitely fire me for not doing my job and maintaining it at night. Great, more shit to handle, and by myself too. Although I didn’t want to, I somehow scraped enough courage into my soul to start to walk towards the upstairs. 

Every step I took made the wooden carpeted steps creak. One step, then another, creek, creek, creek, until finally I reached the top, facing 3 smaller steel doors, all completely pitch black on the inside. I take a look at my watch; it reads 

10:02pm. Ok, game plan here: kick the guy out, then finish the rest of my shift in peace, and let the school know about the incident in the morning. All I need to do is confront the man behind one of these doors, and hopefully he’ll leave without a fight. Just please, please be a harmless homeless person looking for shelter and not some deranged lunatic wanting to kill me. I’d decided to open up the first door on the left. As I place my now shaking hand on the knob of the first door, my whole body shudders. I’ll do it quickly, on 3. 1……2……3! I slam open the first door so hard it makes the walls shake. I quickly flip on the light switch, fully preparing myself to see someone there, but…there isn’t anyone there. Just a black chair and a music sheet stand, as there should be. Which means the man is in one of the other two doors. I shut off the light and closed the door of the first door while mentally bracing myself to open…. 

The second door. My heart was racing at this point; it’s a 50/50 shot that he’s either in this one or the other one over. I brace myself against trying to put on the most authoritative and intimidating face I can, preparing myself to yell my lungs out at some poor homeless fool that wandered his way inside. On 3, just like last time. 1……2…….3! I slam open the door and flip on the lights as fast as possible with a fierce look in my eyes, only to see…no one. Again, I’ve found no one, which means I now know which door this guy’s hiding behind. Part of me was glad that I haven’t been able to find anyone yet, because who really wants to come face-to-face with someone crazy enough to break into a school at 10 o’clock at night, but the other part of me was annoyed and fed up and wanted this guy out of here as soon as possible. 

You know what, screw it, it’s late, I’m getting this over with. I rush up to the final door on the right and bash into it with my fist. “HEY, WHOEVER IS IN THERE NEEDS TO GET OUT RIGHT NOW, OR I’M CALLING THE POLICE! ” I scream, trying to put on the most masculine voice I can. No response. Shit, I really am going to have to take this guy out by force. On three then. 1……………..2………..I stop hesitating for a moment, 3! I burst open the door, already swinging my fist around like a madman, not even bothering to turn the lights on. I then trip and fall over something before swiftly tasting the floor. I lay there for a moment in pain before jumping up and flipping the switch. Wait…no one? No…they can’t be; there was no one up here? But…no, I know what I saw; there has to be someone up here. Could it really be my imagination? 

I stood in front of the third door facing the inside with absolute confusion. Then I heard a cough. It was subtle and not very loud at all, but the room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, so it was pretty easy to figure out where the cough came from. Right behind me. I turn with the speed of lightning, so fast my eyes don’t even adjust, only to see no one. Seriously? No one? Am I going crazy? Insane? Or is the night shift finally catching up to me after all these years? Whatever it was, something strange was going on, and I was NOT going to be part of it. I quickly turned off the lights and made sure all three doors were shut, then rushed down the stairs as fast as I could without tripping. I then ran out of the band room, slamming the large metallic doors behind me. 

Wait, shit…. I completely forgot my cleaning supplies in there. Sure, I could just leave them, but without them I wouldn’t be able to finish cleaning the rest of the rooms. How am I going to explain why I didn’t finish my job to a bunch of angry teachers whose rooms weren’t clean? What? Say that I maybe saw something and was too scared to finish, and I would easily get fired on the spot. I decided against my best judgement to go back and at least retrieve my cleaning supplies, then in the morning explain to the band teacher what happened to the filing cabinet. As I headed back in, a gut-wrenching feeling hit me; every voice in my head screamed at me to turn around, but I continued regardless. As I turn the corner to face the large open band room once more, I notice all my cleaning supplies somehow neatly stacked on top of the filing cabinet lying in the center of the room. I speed walked over to it, trying to leave as soon as possible, but as soon as I went to pick everything up, I felt it. Someone was staring right at me, and then I noticed who it was. 

I dared not to turn my head toward it, but up on the balcony I could see it out of the corner of my eye. A large, thin, shadowy man with long, unnatural appendages and a twisted figure. The man was easily over 6 feet tall but hung his head low and to the side, just starting down at me. I couldn’t see every detail since I could only see him through my peripheral vision, so I couldn’t make out any facial features or human-like appearances, if he even had any. Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t human, but it was trying to be. I couldn’t move, frozen in fear of the thought that any second this creature…this oddly shaped man would sprint down to me and swallow me whole. I closed my eyes, praying that when I opened them it would disappear. That it really was in my head and I was just really tired. Whatever the case, real or not, I had to make a decision to move. On 3 I would open my eyes and look at that thing, then run to my car as fast as my legs would carry me. On 3 then…1, my heart began to race, its tantalizing rhythmic beat filling my eardrums. 2. I began to sweat drastically, pools of it forming at the base of my feet. Please don’t be real, please don’t be real, please don’t be real. 3! 

I opened my eyes and twisted my head towards that gong so quickly that I almost gave myself whiplash. As I opened my eyes in its direction, I then saw…nothing. I let out a nervous laugh of relief, just staring at the spot where the man once was. So I am just losing it after all. For moments I just stood there in disbelief that the man actually wasn’t there. Then I felt something on my shoulder, a hand; I could see it in the corner of my eye. Oh fuck, a hand is resting on my shoulder. A large hand, black as night, with different-sized fingers and long, sharp nails. The hand felt rugged and heavy, almost making me tip over. Fuck, fuck, fuck, this thing’s standing right behind me, and worst of all, it’s actually real. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? I need to run now; I need to run. I fried my head as my flight or fight instincts kicked in. Although as soon as I threw the punch, it connected with nothing but the air, because as soon as I turned my head all the way round, nothing was behind me. I couldn’t miss this chance; I ran straight out of the band room, forgetting all of my cleaning supplies. As I ran, I only looked straight back to make sure the man was chasing after me. I needed to get—WHAM—my head burst against the blue rusted lockers that sit on the other side of the hallway parallel to the band room doors. I fell to the floor with a large crash. As I held my head in pain, my instincts kicked back in again, and I got back up to run. 

I ran down the crooked hallways, my shoes squeaking across the scuffed tile floors. This time I kept my head straight forward to see where I was going, only looking back occasionally. I looked back expecting the man to chase me, but as soon as I looked back, nothing was there. I let out more crazed laughter as I sprinted towards the nearest exit. I look back again instinctively, barely turning my head over my shoulders. This time I wasn’t so lucky. Out of the corner of my eye there was the man, large, twisted, and terrifying, sprinting at me on all fours like some rabid animal. It let out an ear-piercing scream that was so high-pitched and loud it shattered the dusty trophy case I sprinted past, the glass flying out into the hall. I lost it, screaming in absolute fear and pissing myself. I ran as fast as I ever had. Warm teardrops fell down my face as I started to hyperventilate. Then I started to slow down. No, no, no, my stupid body had reached its limits. I guess that’s what not working out for years gets you. I then tripped up on my own feet and fell face first into the hard, cold tile floors. At this point I was so tired and out of breath I had just accepted my fate. I lie there waiting for the creature to devour me or do whatever it was going to. 

But it never did….. I had been lying there for multiple minutes, definitely enough time for the man to catch up to me, but he never attacked me. I got back up on my feet and turned around, and again there was no one. Again the man had seemingly disappeared out of thin air. Was he really real? No, he had to be; the glass from the trophy case was still shattered, lying out in the middle of the hallway floor. As I looked around frantically, I slowly took steps backwards towards the exit. Then I backed up right into a wall. Wait, a wall? In the middle of the hallway? There couldn’t be one; the exit was supposed to be right behind me. But there I was, my back to a wall. I reached my hand behind me without trying, feeling around the wall. It was stiff and rugged and warm and organic and…it wasn't a wall. It was the man. 

He was standing right behind me, and I had just backed straight up into him. As I stand there frozen, my hand still on the man, I could feel his warm breath brushing the hairs on the top of my head. He let out another ear-piercing screech, and I used both my hands to cover my ears as they started to slightly bleed. Some light bulbs shattered around us, making the atmosphere darker, as if it wasn’t scary enough. The man wasn’t attacking me; he was just standing behind me, almost as if he was taunting me. Like he was just out of my range of sight, and no matter how hard I tried to see him, I couldn’t. Like he wanted me to be in constant fear of him. I slowly lowered my arms to my side. 

The exit. The exit is right behind me, and the man is only about 30 feet away. All I have to do is make it to the exit. I gathered up the rest of the remaining strength I barely had and closed my eyes. Then I turned towards the exit and opened my eyes. Of course the man wasn’t in front of me anymore, but I could still feel his heavy breath and relentless gaze on the back of my head. I took each step carefully as to not make any sudden movements to invoke the man into attacking me. Every step I took, he took, like he was walking right on top of me. Slowly but surely I made it to the exit. 

I cautiously opened the metallic exit door and stepped outside; the cool night breeze brushed against my face. Then I sprinted as fast as I could to my car. I fumbled with the keys before finally unlocking my grey 2001 Kia Spectra. I hopped in, started the car, and hit the gas. My car’s tires made a screeching sound much like the man’s as I burst out of the school parking lot, leaving tire marks in my tracks. I had done it. I’ve successfully avoided the man and gotten away alive. I don’t know what he wanted from me, if anything at all, but I didn’t have to worry about that now. I’m calling in first thing tomorrow and quitting; I’ve had enough of this shit. 

The school lights that I had left on grew faint as I drove farther and farther away from it. The tension that had been overwhelming my soul had faded away, and relief washed over my body. I went to adjust my rearview mirror when something caught my eye. There in the corner of my eye, I had seen it. 

THE MAN, sitting in the back seat of my car. I screamed the loudest I’ve ever had before. The man screamed too, his scream shattering my windshield. I closed my eyes before hearing an even louder BOOM as everything went dark. 

The next thing I remembered from that night was the blinding lights of the hospital and the subtle beep of the vital monitor. Apparently I had crashed my 2001 Kia Spectra head-on into a tree. Thankfully I didn’t have any major injuries, just a few cuts and bad bruises. I was discharged about 2 days after the crash, doctors clearing my case as a mental breakdown. Soon after I got a call from the school, I was fired for vandalism and failing to do my job. I’d have to pay for any broken or damaged property too. I know I didn’t cause any of the damages; I know it was the man, but to be honest I was fine with that. I didn’t want to work there anymore anyways. I let out a large sigh of relief as the sun hit my face, spreading its golden rays across my skin. The nightmare is finally over. Or at least that’s what I thought. 

I thought the man was somehow connected to the school and that once I left, the man would disappear. But he didn’t. He was always there. I could feel his gaze, feel his breath, and sense his presence. Every time I went to brush my teeth and looked in the mirror, I’d see a glance of him. Every time I’d rinse my hair in the shower and had to close my eyes, I knew he was watching. Every time I would go to sleep, he’d be there in the corner of my eye at the end of my bed watching me. In my rearview mirror, in back of my car seat, behind me everywhere I went, IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE, he was there.  

I went to anyone who would listen. 3 therapist, 5 doctors, 2 psychologists, but everytime they would just come up with some excuse that I was crazy or schizophrenic or even just imagining the man.

I don’t know what the man is. I’m not sure if he’s a curse, I’m not sure if he’s a demon, and I’m really not sure why I’m the only one who can see him. But if there’s one thing I am sure of, I’m sure the man’s real. He has to be real. Because today was different. There was no man in the corner of my eye today, only one standing right in front of me, staring right back at me.
