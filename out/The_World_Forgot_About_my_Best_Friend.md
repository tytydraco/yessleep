His name was David Hendrickson. He preferred to be called “Dave,” though, as he felt “David” sounded too serious. For almost as long as I can remember, he has been my best friend.

And about three weeks ago, he disappeared.

As I said, Dave and I have been close friends for a very, very long time. He grew up a few houses down from where I did. My school wasn’t massive, but it was far from the typical small Midwestern school. Being the odd, antisocial boy that I was, I slimmed my options for friends right down, which left Dave and a few neighbors as the only real candidates. He was the talkative type, able to strike up a conversation with anyone about anything. It was a skill I envied, to be perfectly honest. 

The way we met was pretty funny, in hindsight. I was seven years old at the time if memory serves me correctly. I was sitting in the cafeteria by myself, eating the slop from the standard-issue plastic tray, when a short, dirty-blond boy plopped his tray down across from me and sat.

*“Hi! My name’s David, but you can call me Dave,”* he had said.

The sound of the tray hitting the table sent a jolt up my spine. I nearly spit out my broccoli as he introduced himself. It took me a second to recover.

*“I’m… I’m Jordan,”* I responded.

*“Jordan? Like the basketball player?”*

The suddenness of the comment elicited a chuckle from me. 

*“I guess so.”*

*“Do you watch basketball?”* He asked, shoveling a forkful of undercooked pasta into his mouth.

I chuckled again out of nervousness. Most people didn’t talk to me this much.

*“No, not really,”* I responded. *“My dad likes football, though.”*

He gasped. *“So does mine! Maybe our dads could watch football together.”*

I smiled at the idea of my dad, a 6’ 1” wall of a man, laughing and shouting at the TV with another guy. *“Yeah, maybe!”*

We’d sat in silence for a few moments before I realized that I hadn’t asked him what he watched.

*“Do you watch basketball?”* I asked.

He chuckled. *“Yeah, all the time. I wanna play, but I’m not any good. My dad says, when I’m older, I’ll grow, and my legs will get long, and I’ll be amazing.”*

*“That sounds awesome.”*

*“Yeah.”*

And that was all it took. I sat in the same place every day, and every day, without fail, he’d sit across from me. He’d have some new revelation to tell me or some random question to ask. He had this uncanny ability to make me care about anything and everything he said. There wasn’t a quiet moment between us.

Even outside of school, he would come over to my house and play SNES, or I’d go over to his and watch basketball. I wouldn’t admit it, but he got me to like the sport, even though I could never and would never play it. Countless hours were spent in the sun or under the artificial light of our bedrooms, chatting the night away or watching some God-awful show or movie.

As we grew up, he got me to come out of my shell. His personality did that, I guess. Soon, more people were sitting with us at our table, chatting with him like they’d known him as long as I had. I guess I had felt a tinge of jealousy in those moments. Talking just came so easily to him. He never had that lump in his throat stopping him from speaking or that block in his head that convinced him what he was saying wasn’t worth talking about. I’m not saying he should have stopped talking; I certainly didn’t mind. I had just wished that it would be as easy for me as it was for him.

Thankfully, he helped me get over these hurdles. I got more friends, learned to talk to girls (kinda), and tried my best to pass my classes. Looking back, I don’t think he ever really changed in the ways I did. He was always cheery, talkative, and annoyingly charismatic. Even his jokes, for better or worse, always kept that middle-school-to-high-school tinge.

Middle school came and went, as did our friends and teachers. Depression introduced itself into my life in ways I hadn’t expected. I found it hard to get out of bed at times. It was hard to find joy in the things I did before. Friends started leaving for reasons they wouldn't explain, or I didn't understand. It was… scary, for lack of a better word. 

But through it all, Dave stayed. He had this empathy in him that I wasn't able to appreciate. When I was down, the kid who did nothing but talk managed to listen. I can't articulate the feeling I had when I poured out my heart and told him everything that had been bothering me, and he just… listened. Was it admiration? Relief? To this day, it's a feeling I struggle to find words for.

When he needed it, I returned the favor. I knew how it felt for everyone to stop listening when I needed them to. I wanted to listen.

We stayed friends even as we graduated. Neither of us planned on going to college, which was fine by me. That is an amount of debt I didn't need for a degree I couldn't promise I would use. We ended up moving into the same apartment complex and even got a job at the same run-down burger joint. It was far from heaven, but we were in the Midwest, so we weren't expecting it, either.

I say all this not just to give context for what I'm about to say but also to convince myself it happened that I remember it happening. 

One cold winter morning near the end of January, Dave didn't show up to work.

Now, there's no way to explain to you how strange this is except to say that it was *exceptionally* strange. Dave would figure out how to graft an extra set of legs onto his hips if it meant that he could make it to work twenty minutes sooner. I think it's crazy, but that's just who he was.

But Dave isn't superhuman. Maybe he was sick, I thought. But it couldn't be a stomach bug or the flu. He was too hard of a worker to let something like that get in the way. Once, he came into work vomiting blood and insisted on working his eight hours. Again, I think it's crazy.

That was a thought that worried me. If something really was wrong, it was bad enough that he couldn't even go to work.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but I also wondered, if it was that serious… why hadn't he told me? From what he told me, I was his closest friend. He told me everything. What made this different? Had I missed something? How long had he been sick? Maybe this was the latest symptom in a long line of issues, if that's the case, how had I managed to miss it? 

I read through our messages while writing this. I can't find anything out of the ordinary. He acted just fine. He said he was excited to work with me the day before he disappeared. I thought I was good at reading people and understanding what they're feeling, but here I am. 

For a while, as I was driving home from work, this feeling of my stomach sinking to my feet was all I was left with as my mind ran circles around itself. I tried to think about his behavior, how he'd acted, trying to find a hole, a loose bit of string to pull on. But my racing mind made focusing nigh impossible. 

I pulled into my usual parking spot in front of my apartment. I turned the key and listened to my car's engine die, the sound muddled by my scattered thoughts. I couldn't do much but stare ahead at the off-white siding of the complex as I waited for my heart to slow. I got out and walked up the stairs to his door. I wrapped my knuckle against the wood, hearing it reverberate off the walls behind it.

I sat there for fifteen minutes or so. I checked my phone repeatedly. I asked where he was, what he might’ve been doing, and if he was okay.

Nothing.

I walked back to my apartment, the cold air biting at my cheeks harsher than I remembered that morning. This wasn’t the end of the world; I knew he was okay. Maybe he was sick, and his phone had died. It’s not impossible, I guess. The rationalization didn’t make me feel better.

The next day rolled around, which was another day Dave and I were scheduled. It was grueling waiting for him to show. I tried distracting myself by doing stupid things like counting the ketchup bottles in the back, thoroughly reading the labels on the salt packets and anything else that could hold my attention. But that little voice in the back of my head, the voice telling me that Dave wasn’t coming, never stopped. Unfortunately, the little voice was right. He didn’t show. Not that day, or the day after that, or the day after that.

The days trudged along. I’d knocked on his door a few more times and left at least a dozen voicemails. Every avenue returned the same radio silence they had the first day he didn’t show up.

After work, I decided to drive to his parents’ house. It’d been about five days since he disappeared. The whole way there, my brain ran in circles once again. Half of me genuinely believed he was okay; there was some reasonable explanation for all of it. He changed his phone number, or he was in the hospital, or he’d taken an unexpected vacation. The other half, though, the louder half, wouldn’t accept these answers. If he’d changed his phone number, why didn’t he tell me in person? If he’d been in the hospital, why didn’t he text me once he was okay? If he’d been on vacation again, why didn’t he text me?

I don’t know how this sounds, but I feel crazy even writing this. Maybe I am overthinking. But Dave has always at least texted me when shit like this has happened. He’d tell me everything and vice versa. What made this so different?

I pulled up the short gravel hallway leading up to Mr. and Mrs. Hendrickson’s driveway. Dave hadn’t lived at home in years, but I knew he kept pretty close contact with his parents. I didn’t want to bother them if it was something small like a stomach bug. The fact that it had been a week since I’d seen him made me feel more sure of my conclusion that something was genuinely wrong.

Thankfully, their SUV still sat in the driveway. Mrs. Hendrickson is a nurse at a nearby hospital, and Mr. Hendrickson works from home. I guess they never sold the SUV they used to drive Dave to soccer practice, even after he’d grown out of it.

I made my way up the driveway, the gravel crunching and the wood of the porch squeaking underfoot. They punctuated the hollow sound of the wind blowing straight through the coat I’d worn. I knocked on the screen door, my breath floating in front of my face. I shivered as the sound of footsteps approached the door.

“Oh, Jordan! It’s so good to see you,” the warm voice of Mrs. Hendrickson said as the door opened. I couldn’t help but smile.

“Hi, Mrs. Hendrickson.” My voice was hoarse from the cold. I couldn’t bring my voice higher than a whisper. “Would you mind if I…?” I gestured to the door.

“Oh, oh, yes, come on in.” She quickly pushed the screen door open. I rubbed my hands together as I stepped inside. “You must be freezing.”

I nodded, thanking her as the warm air greeted me. I could hear the clickity-clack of Mr. Hendrickson’s keyboard in his office.

“Who is it, dear?” His husky voice boomed from the other room.

“It’s Jordan! You remember him, right?”

“Ah, Jordan. Give me a moment, let me finish this.”

I took my hat off, the memories of the house’s layout returning as I looked around. The impressionist painting of Mr. and Mrs. Hendrickson as a young couple hung in the same place it’d been for two and a half decades, maybe longer. I’d been there countless times and spent God-knows-how many afternoons following Dave through the halls. I could navigate it in the dark if I needed to.

“What brings you here?” Mrs. Hendrickson’s voice snapped me back to reality. “It’s been a minute since I’ve seen you.”

“Yeah, how’s the job?” Mr. Hendrickson asked as he descended the stairs. “Got a girlfriend yet?”

A sharp chuckle escaped my lips. “It’s fine. Jackie is still a dick. And no, I don’t.” I chuckled again, more nervous this time.

“Oh, that’s a shame. You’re a catch.” Mr. Hendrickson kissed his wife on the cheek as he passed her. I smiled at the two.

“Thanks. I, uh… I wanted to ask about Dave. I haven’t seen him in a few days.”

The two began wearing looks I couldn’t place. Their brows drew together, and their lips pursed slightly. There was a hint of confusion in their eyes. The looks made the pit in my stomach slightly deeper.

Mrs. Hendrickson seemed to stumble over herself. She stammered for a moment before saying, “What?” with a smile.

“Dave. He’s missed work, and he won’t answer his phone.”

The two glanced at each other, the confusion in their brows deepening. I wasn’t sure what to think. A feeling of unease and slight frustration was growing in my chest. Was this a joke? Was Dave okay?

“Are you feeling okay, son?” Mr. Hendrickson asked slowly. He inched forward as if nervous to approach me.

“What? Yeah, no, I’m fine. I’m just worried about Dave.”

Mrs. Hendrickson’s eyes grew worrisome, and her mouth slowly opened. Mr. Hendrickson squinted at me. I felt like I was speaking gibberish.

“David, your son. He’s gone, and I don’t know where he is.”

They shared a look again, exchanging some imperceptible message I couldn’t decipher. They didn’t care to mask their confusion anymore. Mr. Hendrickson turned back to me.

“Jordan, we don’t have a son.”

My eyes snapped. My breathing became quick. What the fuck was happening?

“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked. I felt something rising in me, a mix of frustration and anxiety. “Your son, David. We’ve been friends since we were kids.”

“Jordan, maybe you’re confused-” Mrs. Hendrickson began.

“No, I’m not confused. There are pictures of him on the wall.”

I pointed at one. As I did, my heart sank. There were dozens of pictures, dozens of reminders of Dave’s existence. Him posing with his parents, his graduation, his first goal at soccer. I remembered them all, seeing them as I visited, watching the collection grow like a fungus along the wall.

Suddenly, he wasn’t in any of them.

My breath caught in my throat, and I stumbled back, my hip colliding with the dining room table. The vase resting in the center of the table tumbled sideways, spilling the roses it contained on the runner.

“Jordan, breathe,” Mr. Kendrickson said. But I couldn’t. I felt my heart racing again.

“Where is he? Where did he go?”

“Jordan, please, just take a breath. Who is Dave?”

My gaze snapped back to them. Their faces were once so familiar and now so alien. What were they talking about? Who did I have these memories of if Dave wasn’t real? How would I know these people if I never met him? Where did he go? Why were the pictures empty? Why were his parents looking at me like *I* was the crazy one?

“I need to go,” I said, my thoughts surely showing on my face as the whirlwind of terror enveloped me. I pushed past them both as they shouted my name.

I rushed out the door, fumbling with my keys with my cold fingers as they beckoned after me. I couldn’t hear them. I wasn’t listening. I couldn’t listen.

I unlocked my car, twisted the key, and backed out of their driveway. I nearly hit their mailbox as I reversed into the road, a car honking at me as they screeched to a stop. I couldn’t care. I drove away, my heart hammering like a clock striking the hour in my chest.

I drove for what must’ve been hours. I didn’t care where I went or what I’d do when I got there. The questions whizzed by me like flies on my windshield. The knot in my stomach nearly made me sick. Who the fuck was I remembering if Dave wasn’t real? Who was taking up space in my mind if Dave didn’t exist? The questions stung my eyes.

I got home, slammed my door shut, and threw myself on my bed. I tried to organize my thoughts and tried to make sense of the torrent of questions the night brought to me. But no matter what I did, the questions didn’t stop. The pit in my stomach only managed to grow and grow as I realized I didn’t know what the hell was happening.



I must’ve fallen asleep. I awoke in my clothes, my hair matted and my mouth tasting like rot. For a brief moment, I wondered why I’d slept in my clothes. The sound of an engine turning over outside reminded me further of where I was. The subtle hum of my AC drifted over me like a soft, warm blanket as I sat on the edge of my bed. The only thing I felt I could do through the fog of my mind was breathe. The questions returned, poking gently into the sides of my brain, but I was careful not to acknowledge them. Not for now.

I only realized then I hadn’t checked the time. The sun wasn’t up yet, but I had no idea if that meant it was night or early morning. I realized, after reading the fuzzy numbers on the clock, that work started in half an hour.

Work that day was a blur. I couldn’t focus. I answered every question with a half-mumbled, unintelligible response. The questions still spun around me. Did these guys remember him? Did they remember the time he fixed the ice cream machine without a manual or the speech he made when we were thirty orders deep and a full line out the door?

Or had I made those up, too?

Before I knew it, the day was over. My boss, Jackson, saw that I was in a funk. He wore a look I rarely saw. One of pity or remorse.

“Jordan? You okay?” He asked. I didn’t want to tell him the truth, nor did I think he’d believe me if I did. He looked at me, searching my eyes as I tried my damndest to formulate a lie.

“I’m fine, Jackie. Just… a lot going on in my head.” The lie wasn’t convincing, not even to me.

He cracked a soft smile. “Jordan… you barely said a word all day. You’re one of the chattiest guys in here. You can tell me what’s goin’ on.”

I felt my brows furrow. I had an idea, but not one I was sure would work.

“Can I ask you something?” I said, looking over at him.

A confused look morphed onto his face. I could tell he didn’t know where this was heading. 

“Sure?” He said hesitantly.

“Can I see someone’s application?”

The question seemed to strike him. Whatever he was expecting, I don’t think he expected that. He looked around for a brief moment. I’d guess he was looking for a way out.

“I… s’pose. Why?”

“I just… I need to confirm a suspicion.”

He gave me an odd look. I could tell he’d thought I’d lost it.

“Sure, kid.”

I followed him to the office, not making eye contact with the workers around me. Not that it bothered me. My mind was preoccupied with the questions from last night, on the events of the past week.

Jackie took me to an old metal filing cabinet and slid a drawer open. He was old-school and preferred to print everything out. I don’t blame him; I probably would’ve been the same if I were his age. He pulled a manilla folder out and began thumbing through the pages within. After a few seconds, he turned the folder over to me.

“That’s the last few months of apps,” he muttered as I took the folder in my shaking hands. He gave me another look as I clumsily searched through the folder. “I gotta tell ya, Jordan, you’re startin’ to scare me.”

His words became muddied in my head as I thumbed through the pages. The soft paper moistened slightly under the touch of my sweaty hands. Names rushed past me as I scanned the pages. Garrison, Glyndall, Hardy, Hamill.

Not Hendrickson.

I double-, triple-checked. Garrison, Glyndall, Hardy, Hamill. Garrison, Glyndall, Hardy, Hamill. I stared at those names so long they blurred into meaninglessness. I asked for another folder and looked through it. Page after page after page of payment information. Nothing. Another folder. Again, nothing. No application, no pay stubs, no W-2s, nothing.

Jackie looked at me like I was a mental patient gone wild. I could only imagine what he thought about me at that moment. That wasn’t the most pressing issue on my mind. How could it be?

My friend went missing, taking every trace with him.



I kind of wandered through the next two weeks. Jackie never looked at me the same. I’m sure he told some of my coworkers, as I was getting weird looks all the time. I haven’t called Mr. and Mrs. Hendrickson, although they’ve been calling me at least once a day. I feel bad, but I also don’t know what to do. How do I explain any of this to them? How do I explain that my friend vanished and I’m the only one who remembers him?

I’m sending this to you guys now. I don’t know if this will disappear, just like those photos or his records, but this is the best I’ve got. If this disappears, too… Dave, it was nice knowing you. Real nice.

I’m going to look into this. I can’t let this go, not while I remember him. But first… I need to rest.
