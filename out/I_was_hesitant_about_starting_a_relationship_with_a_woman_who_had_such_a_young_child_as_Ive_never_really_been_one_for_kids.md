What could I say though? I feel like I'm genuinely in love here. Her name is Piper and we met online last year. After chatting for a few months we decided we liked each other and took it to the next level.

For the first 6 months of our relationship, she wouldn't allow me to meet her kid. This is understandable as she just wanted to be sure I was truly "the one" before bringing me into her child's life. I'd seen pictures of him on her social media pages and he's such a cute little guy!

"What's his name?" I asked her in one of our first conversations.

"Milton," she replied. "He's named after his great grandfather."

Finally, the day came when I got to meet him. I arrived at her house around 4:00 pm and made sure to bring a toy with me. After all, the best way into a 3-year-old's heart is bribery. When Milton heard the front door shut he ran out to the front corridor to see who had arrived. He seemed a little shy at first, but when he saw the Lightning McQueen car in the box I was holding he was suddenly smiling. I smiled back at him.

"Hey Milton! I got this for you!" I said, handing over the toy car. He snatched it out of my hands greedily. Piper looked over at me with a warm smile.

"Milton," she said. "This is Robert. I was hoping that maybe we could all be friends from now on. Is that okay, buddy?"

"Yes!" Milton said, eagerly handing her the box to open.

I'm not sure why I was so nervous to meet him. He seemed like a well-behaved kid. Besides, Piper was the best thing that ever happened to me and I feel I'd literally go to Hell and back for her.



That night, Piper and I hung out on the couch and watched a Disney movie while Milton hung out on the floor playing with his new toy car. About halfway through the movie Milton started to get tired of playing and came to sit with us on the couch. He sat right between Piper and me with his tiny arm around my back. At one point, he laid his head on my side and fell quickly asleep. Piper once again looked at me with a huge grin on her face. This whole scenario warmed my heart like it had never been before. I felt such intense joy in that moment. It was as if I had a real family for the first time in my life.

When the movie finished Piper gently picked up the little guy and brought him into his bedroom where she laid him down for the night.

"He's certainly taken a shine to you super quick!" she said as she reentered the living room.

"Not just quick but *super* quick!" I said jokingly. "What can I say? Kids love me."



That night, while lying in bed next to her, I heard tiny little footsteps headed toward the bedroom. I knew it had to be Milton, likely coming into lay with his Mom who was already fast asleep. You know how toddlers are. They fall asleep in their beds but in the morning you're waking up next to them in *your* bed. I heard the tiny feet scamper into the bedroom. I immediately got up and stood next to the bed. It was much too dark to see anything and I didn't wanna knock the little dude over so I said alouded: "Hey, Milton, buddy. Did you wanna lay with your Mom? It's okay if you do. I'll go lay on the couch."

Silence. 

My eyes hadn't adjusted and it was still too dark to see anything.

"Milton, I know you're in here buddy. Come over here and I'll tuck you in with your mama."

Still silence, but... now I could hear his muffled breathing. If... that is him breathing? The breaths seemed shallow. Few and far between. The most peculiar thing though was that they sounded... deep. Like the breaths of a fully grown man. Not an innocent 3-year-old boy. This triggered panic in me almost immediately. Visions of a fully grown man standing in the bedroom just feet away from me... from us... filled my head. I made my way across the room to where I knew the light switch was as quickly as I could. I flicked on the switch and light flooded the room. After only a second or two my eyes adjusted to the light and there I saw Milton standing next to the bed. Next to his mother. He was holding his hand out and appeared to be caressing her sleeping face. My heart was beating extremely fast and I gave myself a few seconds to calm myself down. He was looking at his mother with love in his eyes. Even for a 3-year-old, you could tell he definitely loved her very much.

"Milton" I whispered. He didn't look up at me or even flinch. He just continued caressing his mother's cheeks with that gleam in his eye.

"*Milton*!" I whispered louder this time.

He didn't remove his hand from his mother's face but his head cocked to the side quickly and I swear I heard a cracking noise. He stared at me with a burning look in his eyes, as if he was examining me. I... can't really explain it, but he looked... older. His eyes seemed to get dark as he stared at me. Not like a toddler when they're angry but like an adult when they're furious. I'd never seen someone so young look at someone like that. I shivered. I'm being completely honest when I tell you I don't think I'd ever seen anything so terrifying in my entire life.

"M-Milton" I stammered. He did not take his eyes off me. He had the expression of a cheetah ready to pounce. "D-Do you, um, want me to help you into bed? So y-you can lay with your mama?"

He continued to stare at me with a deep, dark look of intense burning anger. His mouth curled into a slight smile.

"Yessss" he said in a hiss, eyes still ablaze. He removed his hand from his mother's face and began slowly walking around the end of the bed toward me. Never taking those dark eyes off of me. His mouth still curled into that creepy little smile. As he moved, I felt an intense fear like I'd never felt before. He walked directly up to me and stared up into my eyes. They appeared almost black at this point. He put his arms in the air like he wanted to be picked up. I'm not sure why I was holding my breath. Maybe I thought it would calm me down. Without saying a word I closed my eyes, reached down, and picked Milton up. I placed him in the bed, walked over to the wall, and turned off the lights. I basically ran to the living room. I felt like I needed out of that bedroom as quickly as I could. Away from... *him...* as quickly as I could. 

There were more windows out here and the light from the street lamps shining through was welcoming to me. I lay on the couch without any blankets or pillows and tried my best to get some sleep.



After laying there for what seemed like hours, replaying the entire scenario over and over in my head I must have eventually dozed off. My dreams that night were... interesting, to say the least. All of them involved Milton.

My first dream was Milton sitting in his high chair, smoking a cigarette and playing on an iPhone. Yes, a 3-year-old smoking a cigarette. His mother tried to blame me for this which dumbfounded me. Like I would ever give a cigarette to a kid.

The second was about him being hit by a car and his mother being absolutely devastated! I remember trying to comfort her but at the same time feeling utterly relieved that he was gone forever.

The third and final dream was by far the worst. I was... trying to burn him. He and I were in an unfamiliar house with a fire blazing in the fireplace. I kept picking him up and tossing him into the fire but he just kept rolling out of it without a burn on him. I'd pick him up and toss him in again and again. Each time he rolled out, his clothes and hair were a little more burned but he was unfazed. Those eyes... That smile... With every toss, they got more terrifying. It was almost as if the fire was making him stronger. After what seemed like eight or nine tosses he finally rolled out, looked at me with literal fire in his eyes, and said in a raspy but deep voice "Do you think you're something special, motherfucker? I'm gonna fucking kill you someday." This is when I finally woke up. Without hesitating, I immediately grabbed my keys and left.



About 30 minutes later my cell phone rang. I looked at the caller ID and saw it was Piper. I had no idea what I was going to tell her. Was I supposed to explain to her that her 3-year-old son scared me more than I'd even been scared in my entire life? That I had dreams of him dying, or worse yet, dreams of me attempting to kill him? How about that I was sure he was breathing like a 50-year-old man in her bedroom. Or that I'm beginning to think he's possibly a demon? Finally, I answered.

"Hello?" I said, trying to sound as normal as I possibly could.

"Robert, where did you go this morning? I woke up a few minutes ago and you weren't beside me. I got up and I noticed your car was gone." I could tell she was sad and disappointed.

"Oh, well I actually slept on the couch last night. The little dude came in and I figured he wanted to lay with you."

"Milton never sleeps in my room, Robert. I just don't find it ideal. Besides, if he did come sleep in here last night he's back in his own bed, fast asleep now."

"Did you move him?"

"Huh? No. I was the only one in bed when I woke up."

"Oh. Well, he came in there to sleep last night. I put him in bed with you and everything."

I was finding it hard for my voice not to crack. Simply talking about him was causing my heart to race.

"Yeah, well, whatever you're doing, I need you to come back to the house."

"I... had some plans today, Pipes" I lied. "Maybe we can meet up tonight though?"

"Robert, I have that stupid status update meeting in an hour and you promised me you'd watch him today, remember?"

Oh my God! I had completely forgotten about her meeting! Who even goes to meetings on a Sunday morning anyway? It's technically part of her work but is there no way she could bring Milton with her?

"I... Oh. Yes, I remember" I said. My brain was racing trying to think up a lie as quick as I could but nothing came to mind.

"Soooo... Are you coming back to the house?" she asked.

I sat in silence for a moment still trying to think of anything I could say to get out of this.

"Hello?" she finally asked after a few seconds.

"Yes. Sorry, babe. Okay, I'm on my way there now. Wait. What time is your meeting?"

She sighed. "It's at 10:30, Robert, so I need to leave here in the next 30 minutes."

"Alrighty," I said. "I'll be there in half an hour." I knew I could have made it back to her house within five minutes but I didn't want to spend any more time there... any more time with him... than I had to.

"Okay," she said. "Please hurry back. I really don't wanna be late."

We said our "I love yous" and I hung up the phone.



Exactly 30 minutes later I arrived back at her home. As I pulled into the driveway she was already running out of the front door.

"Jesus, talk about taking your sweet time," she said angrily and rushedly. "I didn't have time to make him breakfast because I was trying to get ready but you know where everything is. We have cereal, toast, whatever you wanna give him. He's sitting on the floor right now watching his movie. I'm gonna sneak out now so he doesn't see me leave and get upset." 

No. We wouldn't want him getting upset, I thought. 

"I'll be back in about four hours or so. You two have fun today, okay?" 

She got into her car and blew me a kiss. I blew her one back as she backed out of the driveway and took off down the street.



"Okay," I said aloud to myself and began snickering. "You're just going crazy. He's just a toddler. Were you high last night? No? Well, something was going on. Maybe you're going crazy?"

Maybe I *was* going crazy. What really *did* happen last night? I imagined this kid as a fully grown man because I thought I heard him breathing deeply. I pissed him off because I was interrupting his time with his Mom who he very clearly loves. And I had some bad dreams.

That's it. That's all that happened. Now that I think about it, I was definitely overreacting.

Even after this realization I still stood on the front porch for another minute or two. Avoiding having to go inside the house. Avoiding having to see... *him*.

Here we go, I thought.

I opened the front door and walked into the corridor. Unlike last night, Milton did not run out to see who was there. I took off my shoes and slowly made my way into the living room.

There he was. Sitting in front of the TV drinking a juice box, just as Piper had said.

"Hey, Milton. Buddy," I said. Why did I sound so terrified? Probably because I was. He did not look up. Too invested in his cartoons. I walked over and stood next to the television. Now he finally saw me. Without saying a word he jumped up with a smile on his face and ran over to give me a long hug. At that moment I had an overwhelming sense of relief wash over me.

"Hey, little dude!" I said enthusiastically. "Are you hungry?"

"Yes!" he replied enthusiastically back. His voice... was normal. He sounded like a child. Like a normal 3-year-old child.

"Wanna come to the kitchen with me? You can pick out whatever you like to eat." 

Without responding, he ran into the kitchen.

"Okay," I said. "Let's see what we've got." I opened the cereal cupboard and he began jumping up and down excitedly pointing at one of the cereal boxes. "This one?" I asked pulling out a box of Froot Loops.

"Yes!" he replied enthusiastically. I poured him a bowl and went to grab the container of milk from the refrigerator. "No!" he shouted. "No milk!"

"Oh, you just wanna eat it dry?" I asked him.

"Yes!" he replied again enthusiastically.

I brought the bowl into the living room and set it on the floor where he had been watching his movie. He hopped onto the floor and reimmersed himself back into his cartoons while chomping down on his Froot Loops.

I felt immensely and utterly foolish. This was just a normal little boy. Not a boy with a man's voice. Not a boy with any sort of evil inside. He was just a normal boy.

Maybe I *was* high last night, I jokingly thought.

When Milton had finished his cereal he picked up his bowl and ran it into the kitchen. I heard him place it on the counter before running back into the living room. He plopped his butt back down on the carpet and was once again engrossed in his cartoons.

I relaxed. Piper would be back in a few hours but I didn't feel the urgency for her to return as I did before.

When Milton's movie was finished he hopped up and ran over to me with that happy smile on his face. He started moving his fingers in a tickling motion and went for my stomach.

"No! No! Don't tickle me!" I playfully yelled as I pulled out my best fake laugh.

"Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!" Milton yelled giggling.

"Now it's your turn to be tickled!" I shouted as I put my hand on his belly.

"No! No! Hahahaha!"

He was having so much fun! He was laughing so hard from the tickles I was dishing out that he was drooling. That huge smile was still plastered on his face.

The app on the TV started playing a new movie and he got distracted for a moment. Suddenly this tickle game wasn't as interesting to him as he was now eagerly waiting to see which new film was about to start.

I smiled. This was actually a good little kid.



With the movie now at about halfway I smiled and looked at Milton enjoying the story.

"Can you believe I was afraid of you last night, Milton?" I asked, knowing he wasn't even listening to me. "I thought - I thought you were... Well, I'm not even sure what I thought."

Without taking his eyes off the television Milton said in his childish voice, "Oh? And why were you afraid of me?"

This came as an extreme shock to me. The only other words I'd heard him say up to this point (not counting what he was saying in my dreams last night) were 'yes,' 'no,' and 'tickle, tickle, tickle'. It wasn't just that he had spoken a complete sentence. It was how he spoke the complete sentence. Once again, it was like an adult speaking. Like an adult who is too distracted to have a conversation so they answer you automatically without thinking.

I felt the terror I'd had the previous night begin to grow in me as I stared at him.

I didn't answer him. I didn't even move. I felt paralyzed. After a moment, still with that innocent voice of a child, he repeated his question.

"Why were you afraid of me last night, Robert?"

Now he turned his head to look at me. The moment he did, I closed my eyes. I didn't know if his eyes would have looked the same way they had last night but I refused to have that image burned into my brain a second time.

I felt Milton reach onto my lap and grab the remote control. The movie he was so distracted by moments ago was now paused. He stood up on the couch next to me and I felt his tiny cold hands touching my face.

"*Open*!" I heard him whine. "*Open*! *Open*!"

Then he began to cry. I opened my eyes and there stood the site of a crying toddler who genuinely looked scared and concerned.

"I-I'm sorry, buddy," I said. He looked at me sadly and used the sleeves of his shirt to wipe his teary eyes. I genuinely didn't know how to react. "Do you want a drink or something?"

"Yes," he said through his sniffles.

I walked into the kitchen and grabbed his tiny plastic cup from the cupboard. I opened the fridge and saw the juice boxes. I remembered he didn't like milk so I grabbed a juice box instead, put the cup back in the cupboard, and walked back to the living room.

When I entered Milton was no longer crying. In fact, he didn't seem sad at all. I was so confused. Imagine having a mix of terror and sympathy at the same time. My emotions were being pulled in different directions.

"Here you go, buddy," I said handing him the drink. He snatched it from my hands and began slurping the juice from the straw. He had finished the entire box in a matter of seconds. He then smiled at me, grabbed the remote, un-paused the TV, and went back to watching his movie.



By the time the movie had finished, I had calmed down slightly. Taking a few deep breaths and trying to focus only on the present moment seemed to work for the most part. I was trying my best to ignore everything that happened in the past 14 or 15 hours.

"Well, buddy, did you wanna watch another movie? Or what did you wanna do now?" I asked Milton.

Then it happened again. The thing I'd feared the most babysitting Piper's son. Sitting only a couple feet from me he cocked his head to the side and his eyes went dark. Darker this time than I'd seen the night before. His face *definitely* looked older now and he smiled so big it looked almost unnatural. Almost... inhuman.

I stared back at him wide-eyed. Unable to say, or think, or do anything. My mouth suddenly went completely dry. There was no use in trying to hide my absolute terror.

He stared at me for what felt like an eternity when in reality it was likely only a few seconds. Then he opened his mouth and said in a raspy voice, "*Agaliarept*." It sounded like he was speaking with an accent.

He sat for another moment staring at me waiting for my reaction. That huge smile was still plastered on his face. I said nothing but you could literally see my heart beating through my chest. My face was in a twist of fear and confusion.

"*Lucifuge Rofocale*," he said turning his head towards the living room. His voice was even deeper and more horrifying now. It appeared as though he was speaking to someone who was not there. "*We both know. Shall I*?" he asked. His smile widened even larger which almost seemed impossible.



"Robert!" Piper shouted. "What's going on!? What's the emergency!?

"Piper you have to come home now!" I said over the cell phone. I had run onto the porch outside while Milton was still sitting in the living room speaking with his invisible friend.

"Why!? Tell me what's going on? Is Milton okay!?"

"No!" I screamed. "There is something very wrong with him!"

"*What!?* Is he hurt!?"

"No. Well... I don't know!" I had no clue what to say to her. Milton was clearly having issues. At least that's what I kept telling myself as it sounded crazy, even in my own mind, to think he was either possessed or was the physical embodiment of a demon.

"What do you mean you don't know?" she demanded. "Is he hurt or isn't he?"

"He's... he's swearing!" I finally blurted out.

"Milton. Milton is swearing?" she asked. I could tell she was having a hard time believing me.

"Yes! There's something wrong with his voice, or his throat. I think he's sick. I think he's really really sick."

"Did you feel his forehead?" she asked.

"Well, no. But even if I did I wouldn't be able to tell if he had a fever or not. I'm no good at that stuff."

I just wanted her to come home as fast as she could. I couldn't be here anymore. I refused to be here. Even if I had to leave this 3-year-old by himself... They could arrest me if they wanted, as long as I never had to see him again.

"He's swearing and he has a sore throat?" she asked again. I could tell she didn't believe me. "How do you know he has a sore throat?"

"It's just... his voice. I can just tell. He doesn't seem okay, Pipes!"

Piper sighed on the other end of the phone.

"Robert, this meeting will be over soon. I can't believe you had them pull me out of it for this. You told them it was an emergency."

"*It is!*" I shouted at her.

"Robert, is everything okay with you?"

No. Nothing was okay with me. I was terrified, and panicking, and sweating, and my blood pressure was extremely high, and... "If you really think he's sick bring him to the hospital. I'll call you as soon as the meeting's out. Okay?"

I didn't say anything. This meant she wasn't coming home right now and I'd have to watch this monster... this - this... demon, for at least another hour.

"Okay," I finally said.

"Love you. I'll see you soon," she said.

"Love you too," I replied and hung up the phone.

About an hour. Sixty minutes. That's it. That's not that long. It's like watching an episode of the Tonight Show. It'll be over soon.

Oh, who was I kidding? An hour with this little beast would feel like an eternity. I decided not to go back inside that house. I'd stay put here on the porch until Piper pulled back into the driveway. Without supervision maybe Milton would drown in the toilet or accidently electrocute himself. I prayed to God that would happen.



Just under an hour later Piper's SUV pulled into the driveway.

"Hey," she said, hopping out of her car. 

I didn't say anything. I ran to my car and got in as quickly as I could. Piper looked at me and raised her arms in confusion as I backed out of the driveway. I could see she was shouting something at me as I sped off. I refused to look back.



It's been two months now since I'd seen Piper or Milton.

The dreams... they just don't stop. And I swear they get worse every night. Milton is in all of them. Most of the time he's doing things only an adult would do like driving a car, washing the dishes, and even shooting a gun. Sometimes I dream he dies and every time I feel an overwhelming sense of relief. In some of them, I do everything in my power to kill him but it's always impossible. Either he avoids it, or it simply doesn't work. One in particular that disturbed me to my core was my attempt to feed him through a woodchipper, but the blades broke and the machine stopped working all while Milton pointed and laughed at me with those dark, evil eyes, and that deep menacing voice.

In almost every dream I've had, at some point, Milton always stares at me with those devil eyes and inhuman-looking face. He always says to me in a deep, adult-sounding, raspy voice "*I'm going to fucking kill you, Robert.*"

I've been talking to Piper via text message on and off, but... I refuse to answer the phone when she calls. I can tell she's heartbroken. All she wants to know is what occurred that day between Milton and I which she's completely justified in knowing. Even after two months though, I had no idea what I was going to tell her.

"Milton is a demon," I thought about saying. "I love you, Pipes, but I can't be around your kid." That would only break her heart even more, or worse yet, she'd think I'd gone completely insane. But because I owed it to her and I did love her I finally answered the phone one day when she called. I told her it wasn't her, it was me. The worst thing you should say when trying to get out of a relationship but I knew it wasn't either of us. It was Milton.

I told her we could meet that night to talk but only if it was just her and I. Milton had to either be in bed or have a babysitter, or *something*. It would have been better if we could meet up in the daytime while Milton was at daycare but we both worked days and the only time we could really talk alone was at night.

Piper agreed. She told me to come over that night around 9:00 pm. Milton's bedtime was 8:00 pm so he would have been long asleep before I arrived.

I arrived on time to see Piper through her front living room window holding Milton in her arms.

"No!" I shouted to myself. "No, no, no, no! You're supposed to be asleep you little fucker!"

I thought about just backing out of the driveway and leaving but Piper already saw I'd pulled in. She had left the room and I prayed that she was finally laying that little demon down for the night.

I entered the house a moment later just as she was coming out of the hallway that led to the monster's bedroom.

"Okay, he's in bed," she said, looking sad and disappointed. I frowned at her, mimicking her sad face. "But..." she said, showing me her prayer hands. "He saw you pull in and he misses you. He wants you to go in. Just say goodnight to him."

My jaw dropped. Whatever game he had going on with me I didn't want to play. The fear that I had carried with me for the past two months had suddenly turned into anger. I'd had *enough* and planned on letting him know it. Right now.

Piper stared at me momentarily with a look of hopeful confusion.

"I - okay," I finally said.

She smiled. I knew she thought this would somehow make things better. She knew I'd left that day because of Milton but she still didn't have a clue as to why. This was the night I was going to tell her but apparently, first, I had a demon to speak with.

I walked down the hallway and entered his bedroom. He had a nightlight turned on beside his bed so at least I wouldn't be going in blind like I was in Piper's room the last time I'd stayed here.

The moment I entered he sat up in bed and smiled, raising his arms like he wanted a hug. My blood boiled. Here he was again pretending to be an innocent little toddler when we both knew the truth. I clenched my fists and jaw as I approached his bed.

"Good night, buddy," I said, trying to sound as genuine as I could. He raised his arms higher like he wanted a *big* hug. I bent down and put my arms around his back, making sure not to squeeze him too tightly.. Honestly, I wanted to crush the little fucker in that moment. I brought my face close to his ear and whispered to him: "I'm on to you, you little piece of shit. I'm not sure what you're doing, or what game you're playing, but you and I both know you're not a normal kid. You're a demon, or a monster, or an 'I-don't-know-what.' I'm telling your Mom everything tonight and by this time tomorrow, I swear to fucking God she'll have you committed. Don't fuck with me."

I pulled away from him and the fear that he would have transformed his face again made me immediately leave the bedroom without looking back. I didn't want to see his face ever again after this.



That night, Piper and I had a long talk. About our relationship, about how everything was going so well and for some reason I'd abruptly left. She told me that Milton was her entire world and that if he did something wrong she would punish him. She didn't want to lose me and she couldn't imagine him doing anything so horrible that I would leave. She continued to poke and prod me about what exactly happened that day but I couldn't bring myself to tell her. She very clearly didn't buy into my original story about his swearing or having a sore throat.

"I think... it's just the whole family aspect," I lied to her. "I'm not used to having kids around, and I know Milton (I shivered when I said his name) is your life. I - I think I just got scared."

"That's one hundred percent understandable!" she spouted. "Listen, I thought we were taking things slow in the beginning but if you think we need to slow down a little bit more, we can! Robert, I would very much love to have both you and Milton in my life."

I knew for a fact that wasn't going to happen. I bit my lip as I just wanted to tell her the truth about everything badly but once again, I couldn't bring myself to do it. All I could picture was her screaming that I was a liar. Telling me to get the hell out and to never contact her again.

"Pipes, I just have to think about this, okay? You and Milton (God, I hated that name) seem to have a happy life together and I feel like I'm a third wheel."

"That's crazy!" she said. "Milton took a shine to you right away! He loves you, Robert! He even wanted you to say goodnight to him. He knew you were coming over and refused to go to bed."

'He's only doing that to fuck with me,' I thought.

I checked my cellphone and saw it was nearly 1:00 am.

"Okay, girl, I'm really glad we had this talk but it's getting pretty late and I think maybe I should go. If you like, you can call me tomorrow and we can continue this discussion.

"No, baby," she said scooting next to me. "Can't you just stay tonight? Milton's asleep and that new lingerie I bought a couple months ago has just been sitting in my dresser drawer waiting for a 'gentleman caller.'"

When she said "*gentleman caller*," she said it in one of those old-timey Southern accents. She smiled at me and gave me those eyes. Then she moved in and kissed me, pulled away and continued looking at me, waiting for my response.

I felt terrible for her. Here was a woman who had done nothing wrong, except maybe give birth to a demon, and was being punished for something her child had done without any idea as to what was going on. Why was she fighting so hard to keep me? As I stared back into her eyes I could tell she was willing to do *anything* to make this relationship work. Well, anything except let me kill that little fucker pretending to be a kid.

I sighed and grabbed her hand. "Just tonight," I finally said, forcing a smile. "But if Milton comes in the bedroom..."

"He won't!" she said excitedly. "He never does anyway. I'm not sure why he did the last time you were here."



So I stayed. Against my better judgment, I stayed. Jesus, I *must* be going crazy. Or I must really love this woman. Before all this, I figured there was nothing on God's green Earth that could make me step foot back in this house while he was here, let alone spend the night. But here I was, two hours later, lying next to a sleeping Piper staring at the dark ceiling. My senses were on high alert waiting to hear tiny footsteps. I must truly love this woman because I'd never been so on edge, yet I was deciding not to leave. I felt my eyes starting to grow heavy but forcibly kept them open. The last thing I wanted to do was fall asleep. In the morning when Piper woke up, I'd make her a coffee, give her a kiss and be out the door *hopefully* before Milton woke up. But for now, I just had to stay awake. I refused to betray Piper a second time but the cost was my sleep. Possibly even my sanity. 

At one point I got up to use the washroom. That immense fear came rushing back to me as I entered that dark hallway. I envisioned Milton standing just outside the bedroom door. Waiting for me. Looking like a full-grown man. Ready to "fucking kill me" as he'd said in my dreams.

As I turned on the light switch in the washroom, light washed into Milton's bedroom. I stuck my head in for a quick second to see he was fast asleep under his covers. Eyes shut. Mouth open with an abundance of drool flowing out.

"Yes!" I thought while pumping my fist. "I hope you're having a horrible nightmare, you little fucking devil."

I peed, washed my hands, turned off the light, and made my way back to Piper's room. I got in bed and continued staring at the ceiling, making sure to keep my senses heightened. Making sure to stay alert. Making sure under any circumstances to *not* fall asleep.



Here is where it gets scary...



I woke up maybe an hour later. It must have still been late because the bedroom was still pitch black. I rolled over to check on Piper and she was still fast asleep.

Suddenly, I heard whispers coming from every corner of the bedroom! 

*"They will deal with you and it's gonna hurt."*

*"You don't understand the ghosts."*

*"I am a force you cannot confront."*

*"Acknowledge me or face my wrath."*

*"Your pain is my pleasure."*

All of these voices... they sounded the same! All speaking at once!

Some sounded to be speaking gibberish but it also could have been some form of Latin. My head was spinning! It sounded like they were coming from the walls but at the same time, they sounded like there was a radio transmission inside my head that was picking all of them up like a radio station!

I sat up in a complete panic! I checked on Piper again. Maybe she could hear them too? They were whispers but they were very loud so I was sure she would wake up! She did not.

"Stop!" I shouted. "*Stop!*"

The whispers only intensified.

*"You have no idea what you're dealing with."*

*"We know all your business."*

*"How dare you scare a young innocent child."*

I covered my ears and shut my eyes.

"*Stop!*" I shouted again. "Stop! Stop! Stop! *Jesus Christ, stopppppp!!*"

Silence now.

I opened my eyes and looked around the room. Nothing. All I could hear now was my own heartbeat pumping in my ears and the crickets chirping outside. The voices were now gone. I was sweating profusely and my hands were shaking. I couldn't seem to catch my breath but after a moment or two, I was able to get it back to being somewhat steady.

I was breathing so heavily and shouting so loud I was surprised Piper didn't wake up.

"What the fuck?" I said allowed and laid my head back down on the pillow facing towards Piper just as the bedroom light clicked on.

I froze. 

Who turned on the light!? My heart immediately started beating rapidly again and my mouth became dry as with light now flooding the room I could see Piper facing me. Her pitch-black eyes pierced my soul. A huge smile plastered on her face as she stuck her long black tongue out making a 'licking' motion. I let out an inaudible scream as I felt a tiny cold hand on my cheek and sharp steel pressing down on my neck. Milton leaned forward and whispered in my ear in an evil, deep, adult-sounding voice "*I told you I'd kill you, fucker*" as he pulled the blade across my throat.

As I lay there blinded, choking and bleeding, believing I was about to die, I could hear two distinct deep voices speaking to each other in thick accents.

*"You did good, mother."*

*"Thank you, Agaliarept. Now get some sleep. We dispose of this one in the morning and tomorrow night my new boyfriend Dawson is coming over to meet you."*

Little did they know, I would survive this encounter to tell my story, and soon I'll warn the world.
