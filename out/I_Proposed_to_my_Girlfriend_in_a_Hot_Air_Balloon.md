Marco removed the weights that had kept us anchored to the ground then released a valve on the burner. Orange flames spewed from within a metal rim and the giant multicolored envelope above us inflated until it became taut. The basket in which we stood jerked and wobbled against the tension.


I turned to Stacy and found her with a timorous smile plastered across her face. I took her hand and held her close as we began to hover a few inches off the Earth.


“Are you nervous, John?” She asked.


“Not at all, babe. Are you?”


She took a moment to stop nibbling at her nails and responded, “If you’re not nervous, then I’m not.”


I adored the confidence she exuded even though I knew it was a show. She only chewed on her nails when she was really nervous. I’d seen her do it before job interviews and before she had to give a speech at a local conference. I squeezed her hand tighter and kissed her on the forehead. She was putting on a brave face for me and I appreciated her courage.


It was the first time either one of us had ridden in a hot air balloon and she had been excited when I told her I’d rented one out just for the two of us so we could experience something new together. Now that we were actually about to ascend, she tried to hide her nervousness so I wouldn’t worry, but the truth was I was much better at masking my anxiety.


I wasn’t just nervous, I was fucking terrified.


My fear didn’t manifest from the altitude of 2,000 feet that we would reach. Not from the disinterested attitude of Marco, our licensed hot air balloon pilot. Not from the exhilaration of having only a few inches of wicker separating us from the unyielding ground.


I was terrified because of the small diamond ring in my pocket.


Today was the day I was going to propose to Stacy. We’d been together for three years and I cared more for her than anyone I’d ever known. We shared the same sense of humor despite our constant argument on which Austin Powers movie was the funniest. We loved cooking for one another and going on walks in the park. The fun times were euphoric and that was when our bond flowered, but it was during the bad times when our relationship solidified. I remembered the exact moment I knew she was the one. 


We were at my mother’s funeral and I was a sobbing mess. The speeches that were given were nothing more than a blur. The graveside burial was a way to let my mother’s loved ones experience closure, but I didn’t want closure. I wanted my mom back. They lowered my mother into her final resting place and just when I couldn’t stand the pain anymore I felt a warm embrace around me.


“You’re not suffering alone, John,” Stacy whispered. “I’m here. With you. Forever.”


Stacy was my world and today I was going to ask her to spend the rest of her life with me while we were on *top* of the world.


“Here we go,” Marco mumbled and pulled the valve of the burner again. Flames erupted skyward and we began to ascend at a rapid pace. Ten feet off the ground. Twenty. Fifty.


My vehicle in the parking lot of the balloon ride tour agency grew smaller and smaller until it was merely a white dot. Stacy’s grip on my hand lessened and soon she was pointing out buildings in the distance.


“That’s the high school,” she said. “And there’s the hospital. Oh, look! Over there is the mall.”


She was starting to have fun. My nerves were still shot, but I enjoyed the view. Trees became tiny stalks of broccoli. Highways transformed into skeins of gray yarn. The landscape spread out before us in overwhelming beauty. The blue sky above seemed endless and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. Hills in the distance got closer, as did small lakes and rivers located on the far side of the county.


It was a beautiful view and I grew excited knowing this wonderful place was where I was going to propose to the love of my life.


I steeled myself for the proposal. I’d memorized a short speech I was going to recite then I was going to get down on one knee and ask the question that would change my life for the better. I stuck my hand in my pocket and felt the ring case.


It was time.


I stood next to my soon-to-be fiancée and grabbed her hand. “Stacy, we’ve been together for three years now-”


Then Marco interrupted me.


“Stezliroph,” he yelled into the sky, “I have gifted you two souls for your harvest. My debt has been paid.”


Stacy and I traded glances.


“Uh, Marco? You okay, man?”


A wind gust swept over us. Stacy and I gagged before we covered our mouths. The wind smelled . . . sour. Marco didn’t react but instead closed his eyes. Tears began to trail down his cheeks and a wistful smirk spread over his face.


Another gust of wind sliced through the wicker basket but this time it was so strong that a low-pitched hum funneled into my ears. I grimaced from the harsh sound.


Then the low-pitched hum from the wind began to form words.


*You . . . are . . . released.*


I gripped Stacy’s hand when Marco turned to us. His bottom lip quivered and his shoulders were shaking.


“I’m sorry,” he whispered.


Then he jumped out of the hot air balloon.


Stacy and I clung to the edge of the basket as we watched our licensed pilot tumble to the ground. Stacy was screaming when Marco’s body slammed into the gray churning waters of the ocean below us.


The ocean?


Wait, we were hundreds of miles from the ocean.


My gaze trailed in a three hundred and sixty degree rotation of our surroundings. Raging water spread under us as far as I could see, churning and white-capping with tremendous force. Thick gray mist shrouded the air in front of us and looming dark clouds unnaturally boiled above. A flash of lightning trembled the wicker basket under our feet but my body was numb.


The sudden explosions of light had made a few of the nearest clouds transparent for a brief moment, revealing a ghastly silhouette of some serpentine colossus hovering behind distant clouds.


“Oh, my God,” I mumbled as our balloon began a rapid acceleration. It wasn’t from the wind. We weren’t being blown toward this nightmarish landscape.


We were being sucked into it.


Stacy was rigid when I pulled her against my chest and told her to hold on to me. Her eyes widened and I followed her stare.


A structure was forming out of the gloomy haze and was approaching fast. My arms gripped around Stacy as I told her to brace for impact.


The bottom of the wicker basket slammed into something hard and the force almost ejected us out of the balloon. We heard rending and snapping. Then the balloon came to a jarring stop.


A desiccated tree had halted our progress. Gnarled branches curl around some of the tension lines above the basket like it had caught us in snare. From what I could see, the integrity of the balloon itself was intact. Its bulbous multicolored shape was in deep contrast to the grotesque landscape around it.


“What the hell is going on?” I shouted.


“I don’t know but I want to go home. I’m so fucking scared, John.”


I pulled the valve on the burner and a spout of flames spiraled up. The balloon lifted a few inches then strained against the weight of the tree. We were stuck.


Stacy pointed to a large limb. “We have to break the branch and get the balloon free.”


“I’ll do it. You stay here.”


I jumped out of the basket as Stacy fished her phone from her pocket. I stood by the tree, inspecting it to see the best way to unhook our balloon from its grasp. The soil beneath my feet oozed a viscous black tar and I saw nothing growing that was green.


Stacy told me her phone didn’t work. The screen itself refused to show anything but solid black. I checked my phone to find the same thing.


A powerful roar erupted from behind me but I couldn’t see any motion. The dank fog shrouded everything in a gray haze and a smattering of desiccated trees stood tall and proud in this eerie place.


What the fuck happened? Where were we?


A putrid smell overpowered my nostrils during another gust of wind. It pushed away veils of fog and displayed the structure we’d seen earlier.


A towering stone temple loomed over us. An army of thick columns stood in rows as if protecting the structure and the walls stretched past my ability to see through the fog. Jagged spires penetrated the sky. Brown moss and lichen spotted the window entrances and rich, detailed carvings decorated the wide open doorway. But what really got my attention was the faint light twinkling inside. Maybe there was someone there who could help.


Out of the corner of my eye I spotted one of the tallest trees swaying from the wind.


Then it began to move toward us.


“John!” Stacy screamed.


The tree wasn’t a tree at all. A giant tall creature on two legs easily removed the distance between us with long lumbering steps. Fog billowed around it, making it disappear as I sprinted back toward Stacy. We were sitting ducks in this wicker basket. We had to get to a better shelter.


I grabbed Stacy and told her to run.


We leapt out of the way as a hand the size of a house reached for it. It missed by a few feet and struck the desiccated tree on which our balloon was stuck. Our balloon jostled and I prayed it wouldn’t break free and leave us stranded.


My heart hammered in my chest while we ran for our lives. I’d never felt fear like this and the terror was mixed with an overwhelming sense of confusion of where we were.


A high-pitch hiss emitted from high above our heads as Stacy and I, hand-in-hand, ran toward the safety of the stone temple. Thunderous footfalls sounded out behind us but we didn’t dare look. Our focus was on the temple entrance.


We conquered the wide steps and lunged into the stone structure. We didn’t stop until we were in the middle of a massive room. I turned around to find the pair of monstrous long legs lumbering back into the depths of the fog outside. We’d made it. We were safe.


Sconces along the walls were lit with flames, affording us a view of deep-cut runes carved in lines around us. The sour stench that had been following us was here too. I could hear trickling water but I didn’t see the source.


But Stacy didn’t feel the same way. She fell to her knees in a sobbing mess, covering her face with her hands.


“I can’t do this, I can’t do this, I can’t-”


I knelt down beside her and wrapped my arms around her stiff shoulders. “Babe, you don’t have to do this alone. I’m right here.”


“I have such a bad feeling about this place.”


“What do you mean?”


When she looked at me her cheeks were wet. “I have a feeling that I’m never going to leave. Like . . . I’m stuck here.”


I took her by the hands and helped her to her feet. “That’s not true. Where you go, I go. If you’re stuck here then I’m stuck with you.”


She grinned a little. Any hope I could offer was worth it. 


“You’re not suffering alone, Stacy,” I whispered, repeating the same thing she said to me on the day of my mother’s funeral. “I’m here. With you. Forever.”


I then removed the small box from my pocket. I opened it and the diamond ring glittered from the flaming sconces around us.


Her eyes went wide and that grin spread into a smile. I took the ring and put it on her finger.


It wasn’t as romantic as a sunset 2,000 feet in the air, but my proposal was about more than romance. It was a promise to help and protect the woman I loved.


“Stacy, will you marry me?”


She looked at me, at the ring, then the terrible building we were in.


“I promise to protect you and love you. I’m not going anywhere. We will get out of here. I swear.”


“You’re *really* doing this here. And now?”


She started laughing and I joined in. The dark humor of the situation calmed both of our nerves.


“It’s not perfect,” I said. “But neither am I. All I can do is swear my life to you and I’m doing that now.”


She wiped the tears from her eyes. “If you’re not nervous, then I’m not.”


My promise encouraged her. She stopped chewing her nails. Her back became more upright. Her shoulders loosened. She exuded confidence and I loved her for it.


“Yes, John,” she answered. “Yes, I will marry you.”


We held each other in a powerful embrace and our lips locked. I loved this woman so much and there wasn’t an eerie place, creepy monster, or fucked up hot air balloon pilot that could change that.


After we settled down a little and got our emotions under control, we looked around.


“Look at this place,” Stacy whispered. “It’s immense, isn’t it? Who could have built something like this? Each stone block is the size of a car.”


“Not who . . . but what?”


“Look,” Stacy said and pointed deeper into the temple. “A staircase. There’s a lot of light coming from it.”


And she was correct. We held hands and continued our journey into this unknown place.


The staircase was unusual. The steps weren’t formed for humans. Each one was waist high and took us tremendous effort to scale each one. Our bodies were drenched in sweat when we reached the “second” floor. In human terms, we were clearly eight or nine stories high.


A corridor stretched out before us with dozens of rooms on each side. There were no doors here. It was like each place was an invitation for exploration and my curiosity got the best of me. Our eyes cast forward to the farthest room located at the end of the hall. A bright light flickered from within and we both silently prayed we could find help.


We poked our heads into one room and the gray light from the window allowed us to see inside it. We found what at first appeared to be human bones. Stacy gasped and I held her firm, but we soon realized the bones were much too large to be human. And the jaws didn’t hold incisors and molars, but rows of yellowed fangs.


We continued on, occasionally glancing into the rooms. One room was covered in chalk markings of some esoteric language. A splatter of dried blood covered one corner. One room had a giant hornet’s nest clung to the center of the ceiling. A flash of lightning outside briefly made the striated fibers of the nest see-through. Inside was a remarkably human-looking fetus.


Another room didn’t have a window and was too dark for our eyes to adjust. We decided to continue down the corridor when we heard a wet, slurping sound echoing inside the stone walls of the room.


We finally reached the farthest room and went inside. A large fire was burning, fueled by branches reminiscent of the ones that snagged our hot air balloon. Flames danced and illuminated the space to the extent that all shadows had been banished to the corners. Smoke trailed to the ceiling but escaped in vast cracks between the stone blocks.


Stacy clutched my forearm tightly. “John . . . look.”


A woman in a tattered shawl sat at the fire with her back to us.


“Thank God,” I whispered. “Someone who can help us.”


I kept Stacy behind me as we slowly approached the woman. She heard our approach and her head cocked to the side. I stopped when the woman lazily got to her feet.


When she turned around my knees buckled and I fell to the floor. Tears welled in my eyes and not a single muscle of my body obeyed me.


“I’ve been waiting for you, John.”


I blinked heavily to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. “Mom?”


She removed the shawl to show off her bright blue dress that was in deep contrast to the dreary colors of the temple. My tears ran freely now. This was the blue dress in which my mother was buried.


She extended her arms out. “Come hug your mother.”


I took a step in her direction. All this time she hadn’t been dead. She’d just been here. In this eerie place. My heart broke for her knowing she’d survived so long among the cold stone of this temple with monstrosities all around. My mom was so brave and I was going to tell her that. More importantly, I was going to save her from this place.


“Mom, I’ve missed you so much.”


I tried to take another step in her direction . . . but I couldn’t. Stacy had a hold of my arm.


Stacy also had tears in her eyes but her brows knit together in a focused glare. “Don’t go,” she said.


I jerked my arm from her. “It’s my mom. She’s not dead. She’s been here-”


“No. That’s not your mom, John. This place is fucking with you.”


My wistful longing for my mother’s touch was unbearable, but it wasn’t strong enough to remove my sanity. Stacy was right. I was with my mother the night she died. I felt her pulse slip away. I saw the monitors alerting the nurses that her heart was no longer beating. I saw her in the casket at the funeral and watched as they lowered it into the ground.


As much as I wanted my mom to be alive, Stacy was correct. My mom was dead. And she was never coming back.


“What the hell are you?” I asked, rage coating my voice.


“I’m your mother, dear. Come give me a hug.”


“You’re not my mom,” I mumbled to the woman.


Her arms fell limp to her sides and her smile was replaced with a scowl. Those soft eyes that had warmed me during my childhood transformed into cold black pits.


“I will be merciful to you . . . but Stezliroph will not.”


“There’s no help here,” I whispered to my fiancée. “We have to get back to the balloon.”


We turned and ran toward the corridor while the thing posing as my mother began to scream. “You will bow and worship before our mighty lord who has reigned over the universe before there was light or time! Your apostasy will not be tolerated!”


We sprinted toward the corridor, chasing our own shadows that stretched high upon the walls, but when we rounded the doorway we were met with the dim silhouettes of half a dozen people walking toward us in the corridor. Stacy stumbled as we jerked to a stop.


“John. They’re trapping us inside.”


She was right. Whatever this place was . . . whatever was in control of it . . . was trying to keep us here. When Marco had apologized to us before she jumped, he was apologizing for this. We were trapped in this desolate place full of madness and the grotesque. Our odds were low but I refused to go without a fight.


I told Stacy to wait while I ran back into the woman’s room. She stood by the fire, her arms spread wide, and her scowl went back to the smile I so fondly associated with my mom.


“My son,” she said. “You’ve returned. We will worship Stezliroph together and let his glory spread throughout our veins. Your obedience is-”


My fist crashed into her face and she fell into the orange flames behind her. While she wailed in agony, I grabbed one of the flaming sticks from the fire and ran back to Stacy.


But she was gone.


Far down the corridor, a group of shadows disappeared down the staircase.


“John,” Stacy said from down the corridor, the faint echo barely reaching me.


I took off running into a dead sprint, holding my flaming stick up as a weapon. I tackled the large steps of the staircase and nearly broke my ankle in the process, but the shadows were closer. They were taking her away and I wasn’t going to let them.


I followed the shadows and the faint cries from Stacy until I caught up with the group in the same room I’d proposed in. With one quick lunge, I swiped down with my stick and caught one of the attackers in the back of the head. It fell down and rolled over on its side.


I lifted the stick again to defend my fiancée from the things holding her but I couldn’t swing. I couldn’t even believe my eyes.


Stacy was being held by . . . five different Stacys.


I looked on the ground at the one I clubbed, and it too looked identical to Stacy - except for the pool of blood around its head.


Two pairs of the Stacys held on to the other two, both of which struggled to break free. I was in a conundrum. All of them were identical to *my* Stacy. Same hair. Same clothes. I didn’t know which one was which and my rage at the situation morphed into complete hesitation.


Then my Stacy solved the problem for me.


“John, it’s me!” My Stacy screamed. “Get these bitches off of me and let’s get out of here!”


I blew her a kiss. “My pleasure, babe.”


I swung the stick like a baseball bat and made contact with a fake Stacy and she crumpled to the ground. The other four fake Stacys looked shocked and began begging me to believe their authenticity.


“John, I’m the real Stacy.”


“Save me, please.”


“It’s me, John. I love you.”


“John, they’re tricking you. Don’t hit me.”


I silenced them one by one with hard blows to the head. Once the final one had fallen, I turned to my Stacy and stuck my hand out. “I told you I was going to protect you. This has been one hell of a day for a proposal.”


Stacy smiled and her cheeks pushed into her eyes in that cute way I loved. “I never doubted you for a second.”


God, I loved this woman.


We jogged through the stone chamber and exited the temple. The bulbous multicolored shape of the balloon stood out against the gray fog and dark leafless trees. Our pace picked up the closer we got until I helped Stacy into the wicker basket.


“It’s still stuck,” she told me and pointed toward the branch keeping us from flight.


“I got it,” I said and began climbing the tree.


I was ten feet off the ground when I could see the snag. I balanced myself and stood on the branch keeping us in this evil place then used my weight to push up and down like I was on a pool diving board. The dry tree shook and waved.


Then the branch snapped.


I fell hard to the ground and Stacy screamed. My eyes fluttered open to see that the wicker basket no longer touched the ground.


I also heard thunderous footfalls behind me.


It took every ounce of my strength to get off the ground. My shoulder shrieked in pain. My ankle was sore from descending the massive staircase in the temple. A headache raged between my ears.


But I ignored it all and raced to catch up with the balloon.


Stacy reached her arm out. “Grab on. Hurry.”


I pushed my head down and leaped, catching one hand on the wicker basket and the other in Stacy’s hand.


She helped me inside the basket but there was no time to celebrate. The long thin legs of what had chased us earlier were closing in. I found the valve on the burner and pulled it.


The burner hissed and a burst of flaming gas spewed out, climbing into the multicolored envelope. The balloon expanded and began to rise.


“Faster, John!” Stacy screamed as I followed her gaze.


The fog wasn’t as dense at our current elevation and afforded me a view of what pursued us. The long legs attached to a slim body full of tentacles. A thick head spotted with black eyes grew closer and closer until I could see the wide scales that made up its skin.


I kept the burner going as the creature’s huge hand groped for us, its fingers as long as my body.


I held Stacy as we both screamed and I knew that if I died . . . I would die protecting her.


Then the hand was below us.


The creature slowly disappeared into the ground level fog as we ascended higher and higher into the sky. The flames hissed above us and into the dark looming clouds.


We’d made it off the ground and away from the temple but we weren’t in the clear yet. The roiling clouds around us began to strobe with streaks of lightning. A peal of thunder was so loud it vibrated my core and every fiber of my being told me to duck. But I couldn’t. We had to get out.


I kept one hand on the burner valve. The other held Stacy.


Lightning spider-webbed around us and in the distance. During one of the particularly bright displays, I got a view of something behind us.


The serpentine colossus I’d seen earlier hovered in the sky. It was big. Impossibly big. A pair of red glowing eyes sat under a cavernous mouth of jagged teeth, all on a head the size of a mountain. A thick body covered in slender fins writhed like it was in pain from our escape. 


A ghastly, sour wind blew and the low-pitched hum against my ears formed words.


*Freedom is the lie of mankind. Obedience is a chasm that consumes all humans. My revelation is nigh.*


The fog grew more dense until I could barely see my hand in front of my face. The wind blew. Lightning popped. The wicker basket jostled and twisted against this strange storm.


Stacy and I held onto each other during this torrent of wind and fear. We shouted into the wind and cried for salvation. We didn’t know if we were going to make it but we did know we had each other.


“I love you,” I shouted.


“I love you, too!”


Then sunlight began to poke through the murk.


Stacy’s smile was as bright as the sun when the gray storm withdrew and left us with the view of our town.


“Look,” I said and pointed. “There’s the high school. And the mall.”


“We’re back,” Stacy said. “We’re back home!”


I stopped the burner and embraced my fiancée and we kissed more passionately than ever before. We’d been through something horrible together but we’d made it out. She was my everything and my all. We cried as the balloon slowly descended, bringing us closer to earth. I wanted nothing more than to kiss the fucking grass.


I had no idea what I was doing when it came to landing a hot air balloon. When I could see we were about as high as the trees, I noticed our descent speed would injure us if we landed, so I turned on the burner sporadically and desperately tried to make our landing as soft as possible.


Once again, I certainly wasn’t a professional at landing one of these things.


Soon, the wicker basket slammed into the ground, bounced up, rolled over some shrubbery, decelerated, then slammed into the ground again. The basket tipped over and Stacy and I spilled into a field of soybeans. My mouth ate dirt and Stacy landed hard on her side.


The balloon eventually stopped and toppled over but I was busy helping Stacy to her feet.


“Are you okay?” I asked, brushing debris from her pants.


“Yeah, I’m better than okay. Thank you, John. Thank you for bringing me here.”


I kissed her then took her hands in mine. “I told you I was going to get us home.”


In the distance, I heard police sirens. I guess someone saw the balloon dangerously close to landing in the field and called the authorities. We were going to get medical attention. We were going to be safe. I had no idea how I was going to explain what happened to us . . . or Marco . . . but I didn’t care. I had Stacy and that’s all that mattered.


“Marrying you is going to be the greatest day of my life,” I said and rubbed my thumb over Stacy’s engagement ring.


But there was a problem.


She didn’t have a ring on.


“Yes, John,” Stacy said. “The greatest day.”


My smile vanished and I almost had to cover my nose. There was a terrible stench coming from my fiancée.


And it smelled sour.
