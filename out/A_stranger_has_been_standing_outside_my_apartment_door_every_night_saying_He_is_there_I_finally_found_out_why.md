It was three days ago when I first saw him. I had been working late and I arrived at my apartment building just after midnight. I was exhausted but happy to finally be home.

It was quiet and I made it up to the 3rd floor without seeing anyone. But when the elevator doors creaked open, I noticed a hunched shape at the end of the hall, just past 308. At first I thought it was one of the maintenance guys. The light above them flickered, so it took a few seconds for my eyes to make sense of the silhouette. They stood in front of old Mrs. Danvers apartment, or rather, they were pressed up against her door, one hand braced on the doorframe and the other curled into a fist.

I cleared my throat as I walked and the person didn’t move. They just stood there, facing her door and oblivious to my arrival. I felt uncomfortable moving past the strange figure, whose face remained down turned. I felt my skin crawl a bit and shuffled past them to my door as quickly and quietly as I could.

I fumbled for my key and just as the lock turned and the door opened. I glanced back over and the strange person was looking at me. There was something wrong with their eyes. It looked like they were too wide for the size of the head. The color was off as well, they were a shade of gray I had never seen in a person. The skin below each eye seemed pulled too tight, as if this person had been awake for days. When their gaze met mine, I thought for a heartbeat that they might ask for help. There was a raw, wincing need in that stare. Instead, their lips peeled back in a way that wasn’t quite right.

I quickly stepped inside and closed and locked the door. I let out a breath and tried to calm down. I threw the deadbolt on the door for good measure and the reassurance of the heavy bolt let me relax a bit. I did not know why, but something about that person felt off. They were not doing anything threatening, but the way they stood there outside my neighbors door and the way they looked at me when I entered my own was disturbing.

Almost an hour passed and I was too wired to sleep. I sat on my couch watching some TV to try and relax. After a while I was finally feeling sleepy and went to my bedroom. I woke up after only an hour to a sound through the wall. It was a voice, thin and papery, like it was being pressed through several layers and still managing to make it to me. It was Mrs. Danvers unit, I realized. The other side of my wall should have been silent at that hour, since the old woman’s sleep pattern was like clockwork.

I pressed my ear to the drywall. It was hard to tell if it was her or not. At first, there was just a shushing sound and a low, wet whimper. Then a strange voice spoke,

“He is there,” it rasped, and it was followed by a rhythmic scratching, a back-and-forth sound as if someone was using their fingernail to saw slowly at the wall.

I jerked back, heart stuttering, and waited. The silence that followed was heavy. I stared at the dividing wall, half expecting to see it pulse or bulge, and finally retreated to the living room with a blanket and my phone. I didn’t know why, but I felt a discomforting notion that the voices were talking about me.

I crept closer to my door and on a hunch I decided to look outside. When I summoned the courage to look out the peephole I nearly fell back and let loose a scream. It was that man’s face. He was looking directly at my door, just staring motionless and unblinking.

I heard a low mumble and realized he was saying something, just under his breath while barely moving his lips at all.

“He is there. He is there. He is there.”

The sight of the murmuring, deranged looking man was disturbing. I forced myself to breathe and try and calm down. The deadbolt was secure, I was safe. I pressed my palm against the door and called out, my voice cracking on the first attempt.

"Listen," I said, checking my phone's glow. "It's 2:35 in the morning. I can see you standing there. I'm giving you thirty seconds to leave before I call the police. This is private property. Do you even live here?”

The man’s face didn’t move, but the chant grew louder, the words threading through the door and setting my teeth on edge. I waited, but he didn’t answer, didn’t even blink. Just kept repeating,

“He is there. He is there. He is there.” As though the words themselves were enough to conjure something behind me, in the dark of the entryway.

Finally I had had enough. I called 911 and reported a trespasser and fortunately despite the late hour, someone answered promptly and I explained the situation. They said they would send someone right over.

Once I got back to the door to check, the disturbing figure had left. I don’t know what I expected when the police arrived, maybe a sudden burst of action, a show of force meant to put me at ease. Instead, I got a couple of tired-looking officers who asked if I had been drinking, and if I was “absolutely sure” about what I’d seen. I pointed out the exact spot where the man had stood; I even did my best to imitate the unblinking stare and the strange cadence of his voice, which in retrospect made me feel ridiculous, like a child telling adults about the monster in the closet.

They left, telling me that if something happened again to contact the apartment manager about security, but nothing illegal was happening for them to do anything about. I was upset and concerned over what had happened, but was just grateful that the man had left. I locked up again and went back to my room to try and get a few fitful hours of sleep before morning.

I woke up the next day exhausted. When I left for work I held my breath and half expected the weird man to be waiting in the hall again, but fortunately it was empty.  I went back downstairs and shuffled outside. I found myself feeling grateful to be out of the building for a while.

It was a long day but the monotony of my job helped calm my mind a bit. When I was returning home I was dismayed to see police outside the building. When I reached the third floor, I saw two officers hunched in a soft conference with the building manager.

Half the hallway was covered in police tape. Mrs. Danvers' door stood wide open, surrounded by a corona of shattered glass. My stomach dropped. I glanced at my own door and saw no sign of a break in. Yet that wasn't the consolation it should have been.

I must have stood in the hall for a minute. The officers noticed me and drew me in.

“You’re a neighbor?” one asked.

I nodded and gave my name. She wrote it down with the lethargy of someone who expected nothing new.

“Last time you saw or heard from Mrs. Danvers?” she asked.

My mind replayed the shushing and scratching, the creeping sounds from the other side of my wall.

“Not very recently, though last night,” I said, “after midnight. I heard… I thought someone was at her door.” I stopped, unsure if I should mention the voice I thought I heard through the wall. My anxiety grew and I felt guilty. I knew I should have called someone when I saw that weird guy by her door. I should have helped her, not just hide in my apartment.

The officer nodded and continued.

“Her nephew found her this morning. Looks like a break-in, but there’s nothing much missing. No forced entry. Whoever did it left the locks in place behind them.” The officer gestured at the splintered frame, now haphazardly propped up with yellow tape. “Did you see or hear anything else? Anyone strange hanging around?”

I hesitated, sweat prickling in my palms. “There was someone. A man. I saw him late last night, maybe two or three.” I swallowed. “He was just… standing there. I called you guys, but by the time police got here, he was gone.”

The other cop, a heavyset guy with tired eyes, looked up from his notepad. “And you get a good look at him? Height, hair, clothes?”

I started to describe the face, but the words tripped on each other gray eyes, those too-tight features, a mouth that had smiled without really moving. I lapsed into silence after only a sentence or two. The cop’s eyebrows inched upward, just barely. “You think he lives here?”

“I’ve never seen him before,” I admitted. “Not once, and I’ve been here nearly two years.”

He wrote down some notes.

“Well, if you see him again, don’t open the door, okay? Call us right away. And talk to your landlord if there’s anything else you need,” the woman said. “Stay safe.”

I nodded, and the word "safe" lingered in my head. I squeezed past the cluster of uniforms into my apartment. I locked the door behind me. Then I locked it again, as if the second click of metal would somehow double the protection. I thought of Mrs. Danvers’ door, splintered. No forced entry. Like whoever had come for her didn’t need to force anything. I pictured the precise, careful way that man’s hand hovered over the door, how easily he could have slid inside.

I called my friend Seth to see if I could crash at his place that night, since this whole situation was making me feel nervous, but he was out of town on an impromptu vacation and I did not have anyone else nearby I could stay with.

I decided to buy a ring cam for my door and monitor it for any sign of that creepy guy. Once it was done, I caught myself staring at the live feed every twenty minutes. Each check felt both paranoid and necessary, like checking that your car is still locked even when you can see it from your window.

That night, I made an effort at normalcy. I reheated dinner and watched some TV. I ignored the pressure in my chest until it went away, or at least until I convinced myself it had.

When I finally crawled into bed, it was with the lights on. My phone rested within arm’s reach, the camera feed open in the corner of the screen, the blue glow painting the ceiling in restless waves. I was restless and my mind kept moving from one paranoid fantasy to the next.

At 2:09 AM, my phone buzzed. It was a motion notification from the camera in the hallway. I scrambled upright, yanking the phone to my face, but the app feed was frozen on a dull blue rectangle. I jabbed the refresh and squinted at the screen.

There was someone in the hall, just beyond the bullseye of view, where the camera’s lens distorted them into a blurred, twitching oval. I held my breath and waited for the image to sharpen. The live video hiccuped, then caught up.

It was the same man, his eyes somehow even wider in the night vision mode. He stood in profile, just staring at my door the way an astronomer might stare through a telescope at some distant, decaying planet. Then he moved, a spasmodic half-step, head jerking in a way that made my neck ache to look at. He bent down, nearly folding in half, to peer at the number plate attached to my apartment. His finger hovered a fraction above the digits and he started tapping them.

He looked straight into the camera then. His face was vibrating slightly in the low-light pixelation, and his lips pulled back again, not a smile, but a peeling-away, like bark flaking off an old tree. I realized that he was mouthing the words again,

“He is there. He is there.”

My muscles locked in place, a cold paralysis seizing my limbs as I stared at the screen. The dread pooling in my gut felt heavier than before, weighed down by the certainty that this man had something to do with the splintered door across the hall and whatever had happened to Mrs. Danvers behind it.

My fear broke just long enough to come to my senses and call the police again. The dispatcher answered, and I rattled off my address between tight breaths. I’d like to think I sounded rational, but I could barely string thoughts together. All I could do was insist, over and over, that the man was back and he was just standing there. I watched the screen while I spoke, ready to describe everything: his build, the color of his coat, any detail I could scavenge from the camera’s stuttering stream. The dispatcher promised help and when I hung up I still felt a surge of anxiety.

The time between the call and the arrival of the officers dragged on. I waited, cross-legged in the middle of my kitchen, phone in one hand, and the largest knife I owned in the other. Each time I refreshed the Ring feed, I saw the man return, peering in, growing bolder, as if my repeated calls for help were only invitations. Every few minutes the pale gap of his face would drift across the camera’s periphery, closer each time, lips mouthing the phrase,

"He is there."

I gripped the knife tighter when I heard the handle to the door rattling, like he was trying it to see if it was unlocked.

When the police finally arrived, I wouldn’t have known it except for the distorted blue flash that briefly splashed against the corridor wall, brilliant and spectral through the peephole. The man outside my door recoiled from the light, or maybe just melted away, because one moment he was there and the next he seemed to have evaporated.

I pressed my eye to the glass and watched as two officers, different from last night swept down the hallway. One stopped in front of my door and gently knocked. I unlocked the door and let them in, the bright LED beams scanning every corner of my single-bedroom apartment as though a murderer might lunge from behind my laundry basket.

Despite what had happened to Mrs. Danvers, the officers barely spent five minutes sweeping my apartment before they exchanged that look, the one that said I was just another paranoid tenant with an overactive imagination. My pulse hammered in my throat as I begged them to check again, to look harder, but their reassurances felt like nails in my coffin. "We'll patrol the area," one said, hand already on his holster, eager to leave. The door closed behind them with a sound like a death sentence, and I was alone again with whatever had been watching me through the camera.

As soon as the door shut, I jammed the deadbolt home again and slumped against the door, suddenly so tired it felt like my bones had turned to jelly. I left the kitchen light on and slept upright on the couch, phone on knee, knife against thigh. I managed to force myself to get some sleep, but my mind lingered on the figure haunting my doorstep.

The next night the whole terrible process was repeated, with a slight change. I got home, on edge but no one was there. I rushed inside and sure enough after trying to sleep for a while, my phone buzzed. On the screen, haloed in the glitchy blue night vision, was the man’s face inches from the peephole, teeth showing in a way that wasn’t a smile or a snarl but a slow, deliberate baring. His lips trembled as he whispered: “He is there. He is there. He is there.”

I heard the sound of paper sliding under my door.

I froze. It took a full minute before I finally crawled across the room and knelt at the entrance, unwilling to expose so much as a knuckle to the air beyond the threshold. The paper was no thicker than a receipt, folded twice and pinched at the edge where it had been pushed beneath the frame. I used the tip of the knife to drag it closer, then flicked it open with the least possible movement.

There was writing on it, shaky and cramped, the sort of print you’d expect from a hand not used to holding a pen.

“He is there… He is waiting for you.”

That was it. It was just the same warning repeated and repackaged in a new, more permanent form, as if the words themselves had more power now that I could see them. I checked the camera again but to my surprise he left before I could call for help again.

I spent the rest of the night on the floor, knife in one hand, the note in the other, as if both could somehow balance each other out and keep me alive until morning. At around four in the morning, my phone died, the screen flickering dark. I stayed there, awake and counted the heartbeats.

At some point I must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew I saw daylight leaking through the window. I checked my watch and saw it was almost noon. My jaw ached from clenching it, and my phone, when I plugged it in, refused to take a charge. The screen stubbornly insisted on zero percent. I groaned when I realized my charger was broken somehow. I checked the hallway camera from my laptop out of paranoia and there was nothing. Not a trace he had ever been there, besides the note I had left on the floor.

I stayed home from work, since I did not feel like risking going outside. I slept again for a few hours, but when darkness fell, I was anxious again.

I stayed up late and when the time passed 2:30 and I had received no alarms I relaxed and thought I might be alright for the night. But at 3:35 I woke with a start. I heard that disturbing scratching, but no motion alarm. I looked to my phone and it was dead. I checked my laptop and when I booted it up it threw sparks into the air and I saw to my horror a knife had been stabbed through the top of it.

I shot to my feet and nearly tripped. I scrambled for the light but when I went to turn them on the switch failed. I tried to control my terrified breathing in the dark room. I fumbled through my drawers and found an old flashlight I kept for emergencies and mercifully the batteries were still good.

I shined the light around my bedroom in a panic. There was nothing at first, but I held my hand over my mouth to suppress the gasp as I saw a message scrawled across my wall in red paint that read,

“I am here…”

I wanted to scream, but I had the sense that making noise would only trigger something far worse. I carefully pulled the knife out of my laptop and gripped it so hard my knuckles turned white. I cautiously stepped toward the door, shining the light all around, looking for any sign of an intruder. The cold from the tiles seeped through my bare feet and I realized I was shivering hard enough to rattle my teeth.

I kept scanning the room for any sign of movement. I tried to slow my breathing and take stock. If something had gotten in, it would be in there with me, but I saw nothing. Except…

Near the foot of my bed, just within the cone of the flashlight beam, sat a black gym bag. It definitely hadn't been there when I went to sleep. Every muscle in my back locked up until my whole body buzzed with pins-and-needles. I circled it, knife drawn, as though half-expecting some animal to leap out at me.

The zipper was open. Inside, I caught a jumble of thick twisted cord and brownish cotton rags, knotted around objects I could not identify. I forced myself to open the mouth of the bag wider. The first thing I saw was a length of thick rope. Under that, a battered roll of duct tape, the edges chewed and frayed down to the cardboard ring. The bottom held two stubby white candles, already half-burned, and an unmarked pill bottle filled with strange unidentified black pills.

At the very bottom, glinting in the light, a set of tools that should have belonged to an emergency dentist or a mechanic. Tiny pliers, scalpel, a drill, something like a sharpened file. I saw a slight tingle of red of some of the sharper implements and recoiled.

I backed up and tripped over something. I bumped hard into the dresser and the sound shook the floor. My hand moved to cover my mouth and still and listened in terrible anticipation.

I thought about running. I thought about the window, it was the third floor, but maybe I’d make it, better a broken leg than whatever might happen if I stayed. I even thought of locking myself in the bathroom, as though the thin door could actually keep anyone out. But I just stood there in the musty dark, clutching the knife and the flashlight, building a fantasy in my head where I would see the intruder coming and have time to stab or scream or do anything but freeze.

Then I heard it again, a faint scratching, louder and closer than it had been the night before.

I slipped out of my bedroom and aimed the flashlight at the front door. A massive figure stood there, motionless. They were much larger than the strange man who had been waiting outside my door. Where a face should have been was only a pale, concave mask, bone-white and misshapen. My stomach lurched.

I stepped back. The floor creaked. The mask turned toward me with terrible slowness. It resembled melted wax poured over living flesh, translucent and sagging. Gaping eyeholes revealed only darkness. Below them, an unseen jaw worked mechanically, grinding like teeth through wet fabric.

Then the figure spoke one word in a cracked a horrible voice,

“You…”

They advanced with mechanical precision, one shoulder dragging, body lurching in a broken rhythm. I screamed and hurled the knife, but it only grazed fabric. The mask cocked sideways, surprised by resistance. I tried to rush forward and kick the person, but a single shove sent me skidding across the kitchen floor, flashlight spinning away. Above me, a disc of light swung wildly across the ceiling as the figure's stuttering silhouette closed in.

I tried to scramble upright, shoes slipping on old grease and dust. The looming figure lurched after me, boots pounding the tiles hard enough to splinter bone. I barely made it around the chipped laminate counter when the edge of his palm snatched the back of my shirt. The fabric tightened, air knocked from my chest, and I smashed straight into the linoleum, the cold knocking sparks into my vision.

They knelt on my back and blackness edged my vision as I felt a rope wrap around my neck. In my desperation I managed to grab something. My hand found the coffee mug I dropped yesterday. It had not broken when I dropped it. I grasped the handle and swung hard, connecting with the head of my attacker. They reeled back and I used the space to lunge for the door, unlock it, and stumble into the hallway where the old man stood waiting.

He regarded me and pointed. No not at me, but behind me into my apartment.

“He is there…Isn’t he?” I looked back and saw the large figure rising and stomping back towards me. I flew past the weird old man in a mad rush and wondered if he had known the other man was in my apartment all along.

I raced out of the hall, down the stairs and burst through the lobby doors. I sprinted across the freezing parking lot in my socks. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys twice before unlocking my car. I couldn't look back at the windows, couldn't bear to see if that mask was watching. The car's interior light stuttered as I started the engine, my knuckles white on the wheel.

I kept on driving for a long while. I finally thought to plug my phone in and when it had enough of a charge back I heard it buzz with a notification. I ignored it at first, then realized it was the same number that had called me back after my first 911 report, the local police line. 

I listened to a message saying that someone had broken into several apartments in my building and that they found my apartment open and signs of the struggle were evident.

Unfortunately the person who attacked me was not found. I have no idea who it was or what they wanted to do to me, besides what terrible things I could conjure in my mind based on the contents of that bag and what had happened to my neighbor...

Since then, I have had to find a new place to stay. If whoever that was is still out there, my room, my building, none of it is safe anymore.

The old man's face still haunts me as well, those sunken eyes that had seen the horror waiting in my apartment while I remained blind to it. He wasn't my enemy. He was trying to warn me, in his own strange way, about whoever had been lurking in my home, breathing my air, watching me sleep. I still wonder what happened to him and just how he knew what he knew.

I check every closet now, look under my bed. I've installed three deadbolts and sleep with a baseball bat. But locks don't seem to matter when that giant had managed to sneak into my house. I just hope he does not find me again, or anyone else for that matter.

I made it out alive this time. But sometimes a warning comes too late...
