****

We’d made it back through the maze of downtown to the side opposite from the gym, but it didn’t matter.  Not only were the ones from the gym still after us, along with a few more dreamers they’d picked up along the way, but up ahead was another group of fifteen or so men and women were running towards us with impromptu tools and manic grins that both flashed murder with each bouncing step closer.  They were practically *skipping* towards us as they guffawed and giggled, and it might have been funny if not for the dead ice in their eyes.

“Jesus.  We…In here!”  I’d spotted the garage door of an old-fashioned service station across the street—it was propped open a foot by a cinder block, and while it might have been a trap set to lure us in, I didn’t really think the people of Braxton had had the time or the sense to arrange it so quickly.  These people…they didn’t move or look right, and not just because they were crazy and trying to kill us.  They all looked *off* somehow.  Maybe it was the way they moved, or the loose way the skin hung on their cheeks, even when pulled back with their fishhook smiles.  They were becoming something different, though whether it was less or more, I couldn’t say.

All of those thoughts were in the back of my mind as we rushed over to the door and I tried to pull it up further for Mrs. Graves and Mr. Holliman to crawl under.  The door only budged a few more inches before it let out a protesting rusty squeal and would go no further.  Graves had already rolled through the gap, leaving a smear of blood in her wake, and Holliman was grunting as he sucked in his stomach and pulled himself past the door.  Gasping with exhaustion and terror, I looked over my shoulder to see how far away the crowds were.  The one cutting us off was still some distance away, though they were moving fast, but the ones behind us since the gym were thirty yards at most. I dropped to my belly and rolled through the gap, kicking the cinder block free as I went.

It all happened in a few harried seconds, but as I was getting to my knees I already realized the problem.  The block had been so easy to kick away because the door hadn’t dropped back down when I let go to scoot under it.  It was stuck, and as I stood up and started pulling on the other side, it immediately became clear that neither me nor Holliman’s frenzied yanks and kicks were doing much good.  

“Back here!  There are tires!  Wedge them under!”

Mrs. Graves’ voice was soft but strident, cutting through my panic as I followed her words to the back wall of the garage.  There were several stacks of old tires back there, including several truck tires big enough to block the door gap if put end to end.  Holliman ran with me to the back, yanking tires down and sliding them across the concrete floor to jam them into the space between the ground and the edge of the door.  They were on the other side, clawing and pounding and laughing their heads off as they told us to let them in, but either they didn’t catch on that we were plugging the hole they could crawl through or they just didn’t care.  A couple of minutes later we had five tires jammed across the opening, with the last bit of space partially blocked by a heavy-duty hand truck we stuffed into the corner and ran through with chain to the last tire so it wouldn’t be easily removed.

Yet for all that, I knew it would only take a few minutes for the mob to dismantle our defenses, and that’s assuming they couldn’t force the door up themselves.  I looked over and saw the same worries on the faces of Holliman and Graves.

She looked past me and nodded towards the far corner.  “There’s a door back there.  You better go close it in case they come in that way.”

Turning fast, I saw what she meant—an open door that seemed to lead to the store part of the gas station.  Heart in my throat, I went to the door and peered through it.  The store itself still seemed empty and intact, but I could see more and more people gathering outside.  I jerked backward, afraid they might see me through the glass despite the darkness inside the store, but peeking back out a few moments later, there was no sign that they had.  Still, they’d seen us go in here, right?  Why weren’t they coming in after us?

Stepping back through the door and closing it behind me, I quietly slid over a mechanic’s creeper and propped it under the knob before turning back to my employers.  Holliman had managed to tourniquet Mrs. Graves’ upper arm with her belt and bandage her forearm with a strip from his shirt, and while the strip of cloth was already turning red with blood, it was definitely an improvement from how she’d looked a few minutes earlier.  Other, of course, from the fact that she looked as terrified as I felt.

I walked back over to them, keeping my voice low.  “Why aren’t they coming in?  There’s more around on the store side, but they weren’t even really looking in through the windows.  It’s like they forgot we’re in here.”

Holliman grimaced and gave a nod.  “That’s probably exactly what has happened.  We need to be very careful to not make noise or let them see us.”

I frowned at him.  “But how does that work?  Are they like so crazy or brain-damaged that they don’t remember chasing us in here just now?”

Graves shook her head.  “No, I don’t think so.  Based on what we’ve seen and what we know, they may be insane, but they retain a large degree of sophistication.  I think this is just…well, a measure of protection we’re being provided by our service, even here.”

I felt a flare of anger at her carefully chosen words.  “Oh, so more magic from ‘our service’?  And what exactly do we serve again?  Because I seem to always miss out on that part.”

Holliman started turning red.  “Clint, now is not…”  

I raised my hand and cut him off.  “Fuck it.  Just save your bullshit.  You’re actually right.  We’re about to die, and I’d rather focus on that *not* happening.  Any ideas?”  I glanced between the two of them.  “Either of you?”

A look passed between them and then Holliman glanced toward the shadowy back corner of the garage.  “I don’t think there’s another way out of here, but even if there was, they’d just be after us again as soon as we ran.  But if they’re that discombobulated…Clint, how many do you think are out there right now?”

I shook my head.  “Shit, I don’t know.  There were probably thirty or forty following us, right?  And another twelve or fifteen trying to cut us off.”  I glanced back toward the store side of the gas station.  But when I was closing the door I could see out the windows pretty good and…yeah, there are still more coming.”

Holliman fluttered his hand in frustration.  “Yes, I understand.  But how many?  By your best guess?”

Scowling, I gave a shrug.  “I don’t know.  Probably a hundred or more if none of them are leaving again.”

He gave me a grim smile.  “Good.  That may be enough.”

“Enough for what?”

Wiping his forehead, he gestured up at the fluorescent light sullenly illuminating the dingy garage we were in.  “Have you wondered about the electricity?  Not every place has power it seems, but some do.  And where is that coming from?  Is there an active power plant within the bubble of this place, filled with giggling electricians and engineers that are keeping the lights on?  Or are there power lines running outside the bubble to where time and nature move differently?  Some kind of life line to the world outside this…” he waved around at the garage, his face contorted with disgust.  “This insane hell?”  He waggled a finger.  “No.  Neither.  The thing that has taken this place and its people is keeping the lights on.   Keeping the people asleep until now, feeding on their dreams and using a bit of that power to maintain certain things for whatever reasons.  Perhaps to more easily lure in the occasional traveler, though that’s just a guess.  And it doesn’t matter.  What *does* matter is that it takes resources, and the more dreamers we take from it, the weaker it will become.”

I rolled my eyes.  “Well, no shit.  But I don’t think these fuckers are going to let us get near them with the eyedropper.  And they don’t look too sleepy either.”

Holliman started to give an angry reply when Mrs. Graves put a hand on his arm and my own.  “When they were in that dream state, the Elixir was the only way to end that connection.  If we had simply gone around and killed them, their deaths would have provided a powerful boost to this thing, perhaps more than just letting it feed on them until they could no longer be sustained.  It would have been akin to a ritual sacrifice.”

I felt my stomach twist as I saw where this was heading.  “And now?”

She let out a long, tired sigh.  “Now?  Now it has had to wake up part of them.  Sacrificing the power of their dreams to create a standing army to eliminate a threat—us.  Unless and until they sleep again, that power is lost.”

Holliman cut in.  “And if you’re right, and there are a hundred or more out there, and given those we’ve already dosed, we could move past the breaking point in one fell swoop.”

I stared at her.  “You’re talking about killing them, aren’t you?  Murdering a hundred people.”

Graves shook her head.  “No.  Not murder.  Self-defense.  They *will* kill us eventually, and in horrible ways.  This place…we’re trapped here.  Hard as it may be to hear, it’s going to be either them or us.”

Holliman snorted.  “Enough of this.  We can moralize after we’re no longer in danger.”  He pointed to the abandoned sedan sitting in the far corner of the garage.  “Clint, go look for gas and oil.  If you can’t find much, see if you can syphon some from that car.  I’d guess we’ll need at least twenty gallons to spray them all down.”

I backed up a step.  “What’re you talking about?  You’re going to walk out there and what?  Spray them down with oil and gas and set them on fire?”

He chuckled.  “No.  That’d be suicide.  Don’t be an idiot.”  He pointed to a skylight above the sedan.  “I’m going to have you pry that open and we’ll go onto the roof and spray it down on them.  If we’re careful and they don’t see us, they may just let us do it until it’s too late.  But first you need to find something liquid that will burn.”

I looked back at Graves.  “And you’re okay with this?”

She looked on the edge of tears.  “I’m not okay with any of this, but we don’t have a choice.  We have a job to do, and they will kill us otherwise.  Please Clint.”

Holliman looked ready to argue further, but I cut him off.  “Save it.  I’m doing this because you’re both right, but that doesn’t mean I like it.”

He nodded.  “I appreciate that.  I feel the same way.  Will you please go find us some flammables while I stay with Gracie?”

“Sure…I…yeah, sure.”

The garage was big enough to hold two cars at a time, but with only the one slot occupied, I didn’t think there’d be much to really search.  Most of the walls were lined with tools, and there were miscellaneous pieces of equipment along the perimeter, but it wasn’t until I started around the car that I saw something of interest.

It was a pair of feet.

I let out a gasp and started to back away, but something stopped me.  This…wasn’t right.  The feet were laying at a weird angle and looked…lifeless.  Taking a couple of steps forward, I could see more of the man’s body.  

He had clearly been dead awhile, though it was to tell how long in this place, and it wasn’t hard to see how he’d died.  A box cutter still lay clasped in his withered hand, stained from the gash he’d put in his own neck at the end.    I thought about the cinder block at the door and wondered if he was the one that had put that there, maybe hoping someone else would come along and rescue him for a time before he gave up hope.

Tears springing to my eyes, I looked over at his other hand.  It was a plastic grocery bag, and inside were the dried ruins of what had probably once been half an ice cream cake, along with plastic plates, candles, and other party supplies.  Jesus.  This looks like he was going to his kid’s birthday party.

I stumbled back a step before my eyes caught on a large metal drum in the corner.  Black painted letters were stenciled along the side, with the first line saying “50 gal”.  Below that, was a longer line.  “Waste Oil.”  Stepping cautionly by the poor dead man, I gingerly rocked it.  It felt most of the way full.  Sighing, I looked back down at the birthday bag.

When I came back around, Graves and Holliman were looking at me with expectant desperation.  I nodded.   “I found a drum back here.  I think it has like thirty or forty gallons of old oil in there.”  I threw a small plastic bag at Holliman’s chest.  Flinching, he fumblingly grabbed it and looked at it before giving me a sullen stare.  

“Party balloons?”  His face split into a grin as he began to laugh softly.  “Oh, I see.  Yes.  That should work well.  Yes, yes.”  

“Yeah.  Let’s just…let’s hurry and get this done.  Come help me get the barrel out.” 

Easing up from his spot next to Mrs. Graves, he bustled over past me, still chuckling.  “Sure thing, chief.  Time for a fire tonight!”

Frowning at him, I turned to look back at Graves, her eyes wide and more fearful than when we’d barely escaped the mob outside.  She was mouthing something to me, lips trembling as she tried to enunciate each word clearly across the shadowy space.
