I woke up a few minutes ago. I stayed in bed for a while, though. I wanted to make sure I was hearing it right before I got up. I'd thought it had moved on. Windows, soda bottles, wine glasses... they were all gone. Why was it back?



Yeah... that's definitely the sound of glass breaking.



An unmistakable sound - the sharp impact of a small hammer and then the tinkling of tiny pieces hitting the tile floor, crumbling away even smaller. It sounded small, thinner this time... a lightbulb? No, it got all the lightbulbs on the fourth pass through the hallway.



The windows went first - which, of course, could only be broken from the inside of the fourth floor hallway. The outside had been boarded up for the hurricane. With the glass of the windows broken and picked clean, the plywood boards did little to keep the wet roar of the hurricane out of the hotel.



The storm was unending. The ocean has overtaken the land and everywhere was a raging torrent. I don't remember how I got here. I woke up and I was alone in a resort, boarded up and abandoned for the hurricane. The bottom floor is flooded and I cannot leave this building until the storm subsides... which hasn't happened in the ten days I've been here.



It was back outside, patrolling the hallway.



I held my breath. I don't know why I still did it - it obviously wasn't after me. But I still did it out of habit, out of blind superstition and good luck. I'd held my breath and remained frozen the other times it had slowly stomped by... who was I to risk breaking such a perfect record? When baseball players are on a winning streak, they don't change their socks. Maybe I shouldn't change mine, either. If I were wearing any...



There was a huge crash. Not glass. It was wood splintering. I almost exhaled and had to clamp my hand over my mouth to keep from breathing. It'd surely hear me. I froze on the bed, afraid I'd wet myself... afraid that if I did, it'd surely smell my wet, yellow fear with that awful snout through the crack under the door. 



It had heard the guy down the hall in another room a few days ago. The other guy wasn't quite as fearful as I've been. His winning streak didn't last as long. He made a run for it. The thing chased him down faster than I'd expected - I was watching through the little fisheye peephole the whole time - and when it caught him...

I hadn't left this room since then. I can't.  I don't dare.  Not now.  Before I saw... I could have moved around.  The resort was completely abandoned and I could have moved into any other room. I'd thought I was the only one here until... until I'd heard the commotion. The sound... The door getting kicked in - that huge wooden crash - and the poor man screaming. It pulled him into the hallway as if to show me, to afford me a better view of that poor man's end.



I haven't moved a muscle since that day... I hid under the sheets and haven't left.  I still hear it moving around, lurking in the room a few doors down. It's taking too long. It isn't patrolling anymore. I can't... I have to breathe. I do it slow and quiet through the closed fingers of my hand.

It's searching. It's getting more thorough. It had kicked in the door to that empty room and is now rummaging around inside - looking for more glass to shatter. I hear it breaking things. Maybe a mirror in the bathroom. Maybe one of the panels of sliding glass door to the balcony - I do hear the howl of the storm louder now...



Back then... I saw the beast through the peephole... When it had caught the man three rooms to the left, I'd seen it. The thing was massive, in a way... short, but so incredibly thick. It was round - and wide as it was tall. It was the first time I'd risked looking at it through the peephole for more than a paralyzed moment. It was vaguely man shaped. Short stocky arms and thick legs like treestumps. Long, greasy black hair hiding it's face. I could not see its eyes. There was a dripping, slimy pig snout parting the hair.



The Pig Man held a hammer - it looked small, no bigger than a toy in its massive pinkish-gray hand. As it gripped the handle, the swollen skin on the back of its fat hand looked ready to pop.



It beat the man savagely. Two strikes and he was dead.  One blow stunned him. The second left him limp and motionless. But the thirtieth? The fiftieth? The Pig Man left a smear of what used to be a man. And when it finished pummeling... the Pig Man stood for a moment and regarded what it had done... then it pounded out one of the plywood window panels, lifted the red pulp by what may have once been an arm or a leg and tossed it out the third floor window into the raging tempest below. The flood water below was moving fast and the hurricane swept away whoever that man had been.



It was unceremonious. I'd at least expected the Pig Man to eat him. Hell... I'm so hungry that even I would have been tempted to give a nibble... but the Pig Man doesn't eat flesh.



It eats glass.


It shatters it and picks up the pieces with chubby, thick fingertips. It puts the shards into its bleeding mouth and chews. I've heard the thing do it. It bit into a glass Coca-Cola bottle while it was standing outside my door. It cracks the pieces between its teeth and he swallows it into that cavernous throat - and goes right back for more.



Another huge, wooden crash - this time closer to my room. It's going room by room. Oh dear God... it's going to kick in my door, too... what am I going to do? That hammer... I can't stay in here... do I hide? My breath is coming hotter and faster now. My winning streak - my living streak - is running out.

Do I run while it's in the next room? It might hear me... maybe I can run past and hide in one of the rooms it's already checked. The thing won't go back in there... right?



Do I sneak out the balcony and try to drop down a story? No... the storm is too strong. I can't climb in this wind. It's stripped the fronds from the palm trees, it'll cut me down like a razor.



Do I hide and hold my breath? Under the bed? In a wardrobe? 



No... it's too late.
I hear it, chewing, just outside my door.
