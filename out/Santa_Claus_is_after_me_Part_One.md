My wrists ached as I swung the hammer down for what had to be the tenth or twelfth time.  Each time the head of the hammer met the head of the Santa, the sound got softer and wetter, and my hands were starting to get slick with sweat and blood as I staggered back to look at my handiwork.  Had I done it?  Was he dead?  Was it over?

But no.  That’s when I heard it.  A stealthy ripping of fabric further down, a darker smear of blood against the red velvet of his pants, and right where his ass crack would be, a black rip as something grey and shiny shot out of the gap and between my legs. 

Screaming, I leapt halfway up the nearby dumpster and scrabbled the rest of the way over the side, terrified that the thing I’d seen would follow me in there.  But no, either it couldn’t or it didn’t want to, because I could still see its dark silhouette further down the alleyway, peering out from around a stack of broken crates.  It seemed to be looking at me though I couldn’t see its eyes.  Couldn’t say for sure it even *had* eyes.  We stayed like that, staring across the ruined corpse of the red bucket Santa—his head caved in and his ass blown out—for what felt like an hour, and then it suddenly turned and scampered away.

It took me another ten minutes before I could make myself leave the dumpster.  I only left then because I knew someone would find the body eventually, and if I was five feet away and covered in his blood, there was only one way things would go.  Jail, probably followed by some kindly looking old Santa coming to visit the inmates.  Without weapons or a way to run, I’d be dead before the cops could even try to stop him.

So I wiped off the blood with trash from the dumpster, zipped up my jacket and pulled my socks up over the cuffs of my jeans before climbing out and stepping around the body.  It was hard not to run out to the street, but I didn’t want to raise any unnecessary suspicions.  Cold air burning in my chest with each panicked breath, I forced myself to walk slowly out to the sidewalk and turn away from the direction that would take me home.

I didn’t have a clear plan for why I took a strange route.  Part of it was the vague idea of losing the grey thing if it was following me, though I didn’t know that it was.  So far, I’d been attacked by three different Santas over the last week, but none of them had tailed me as far as I knew—just stalked me for a little while and then jumped me when I was alone.  Flagging down a cab, I gave a small, bitter laugh.

Over the last week three Santas had tried to kill me.  Or at least something that was getting inside of them.  I glanced down at the blood around the edge of my nails before stuffing my hand back in my pocket.  Over the last week, either the world had gone insane or I had.  

Either way, I was fucked.

**Five days earlier**

“Looks like Santa must be pissed at you.”

I glanced up at where Brie was propped up against the customer service counter, smirking at me.  “What?  What do you mean?”

She hooked a thumb over her shoulder towards a figure slowly trundling along with a few cases of canned vegetables on a handtruck.  “He put Cole in your stocking.”  She started snorting laughter as Cole Hanson wandered around the corner of an aisle and out of sight.

Shooting her a dark look, I shook my head.  “No fucking way.  They put him back on restock now?  Half the store’s cleaned out and he takes forever.”

Still chortling, she gave a shrug.  “Yeah, I guess with so many people being off already…I told Ted he shouldn’t hire so many college kids.  They’re back home and we’re stuck with a skeleton crew.”

I gestured impotently in the direction of where I’d last seen Cole.  “But…he’s a moron.  I know he’s Ted’s wife’s cousin or some shit, but he can’t even use a pallet jack, and he moves like a fucking turtle.”  I looked back at her, desperation in my voice.  “Is anyone else working stock?”

Her face grew more serious as she looked at me with something approaching sympathy.  “No, and before you ask, I can’t stay past nine.  Mom’s having an early Christmas party and she’ll skin me if I don’t come straight after work.”

I nodded.  “Yeah, that’s fine.  I’ll help him do it.  It’ll still take hours, but I can’t leave until it’s done or Ted’ll be pissed in the morning.”

Brie gave me a grin.  “Perks of being assistant manager, right?”

Snorting, I checked my watch.  Half an hour until closing and then I could go start stocking the shelves.  Cole would probably have at least ten cans of peas back out by then.  Fuck me.  “You say so.”

**** 

“Thanks for the help tonight, man.  I swear I’m going to ask Ted to give me another chance with the pallet jack soon.”

Locking the door, I turned to look at Cole.  He was an idiot doofus, but he wasn’t a bad guy.  “Sure, man.  No problem.  And if he okays it, I’ll be glad to give you tips on how to steer it and all, okay?”

Cole’s face brightened.  “Hey, cool, man.  You have a good night, yeah?”

It was after midnight and as I turned to look out at the empty parking lot, I saw my car alone in the farthest corner of the lot.  Cole apparently wasn’t aware of the employee parking rule, as he was already to his car and gone by the time I’d made it halfway across.  I hated this parking lot.  It was big and dark, and when it was this late and cold, it felt terribly lonely, like I was the last person left on the planet.  Maybe that’s why I felt a moment of relief when I heard footsteps behind me.

Glancing back, that cheer froze in my chest and slid down into my belly.  It was a short, fat man dressed up like Santa Claus, walking slowly in my wake across the deserted lot.  It wasn’t that it was the wrong time of year—it was just a week until Christmas, after all—but why was he out there so late?  And why was he following me, slow and quiet, like he was trying to sneak up on me?

Trying to dispel the nervous awkwardness I felt, I lifted my hand in a wave as I sped up my pace.  “Hey there, Santa.”

He didn’t say anything or wave back.  Instead, he stopped dead still for a moment, staring at me with eyes that I couldn’t see so much as feel, but that felt hot and crazy as they bored into me.  It wasn’t like I had a real thought process after that.  Just an autonomic response of “fuck this” and then I took off running toward my car.  The asphalt was icy and uneven in spots, but I managed to keep my footing.  Glancing back once, I saw that he was no longer standing and staring.  Instead, he was running hard and fast with his head down like a linebacker or a charging bull.  Hard and fast toward me.

Despite his size and heft, he might have caught me before I got in my car if he hadn’t slipped.  But his black boot hit a patch of ice and he slid down onto his face with a soft grunt.  I got in my car and looked in my side mirror as I locked the door.  He was already getting back up, his face scraped up and his white beard quickly turning red with blood.

“Oh fuck.”

I cranked the car and made the quick choice to drive forward over the curb instead of backing out and either hitting him or putting myself more into his reach.  I made it onto the road with a scraping thud and started to drive away, my hot, panicked breaths fogging up the windshield so much I could barely see as I picked up speed and reached the intersection.  I made the turn fast, and only when I was fifty yards past turning did I look back in my rearview.

He was still behind me, running into the intersection and turning to fo…

That’s when the truck ran him over.

It was a big truck—one of those with an extended cab and double wheels on the back.  Something for construction maybe.  Either way, it ran him down at a good speed before slamming on the brakes and skidding to a halt.  I had slowed to a crawl but didn’t stop, as I didn’t want my brake lights lighting up and calling more attention to myself.  A man got out—it was hard to say at a distance, but the lights were decent on that street and the guy looked to be young to middle-aged.  He ran up to the Santa’s body and then…I heard him scream.  At first I thought it was just he was upset at what had happened or the shape of the man’s body, but then he started running away, jumping back in his truck and driving off.

I did the same.  I was shaking terribly, and it took me twice as long as normal to make my way home, but even when I got inside and locked my door, my mind and pulse wouldn’t stop racing.  Part of it was just the strangeness of the whole thing, but that wasn’t all.  It was that when the truck guy had screamed and ran, he hadn’t looked like he was running from the scene of running down another person.  If he’d been doing that, I figure he would have just focused on getting to the truck or maybe glanced around to see if anyone had seen him do it.  But that wasn’t what he had done.

He’d been looking back behind him, not back at the body, but closer to him and lower to the ground.
