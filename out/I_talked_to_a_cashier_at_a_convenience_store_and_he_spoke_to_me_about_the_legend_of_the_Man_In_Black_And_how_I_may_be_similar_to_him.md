I walked down to a convenience store to pick up a few snacks for my travels. I was the only one inside said convenience store since it was early morning. The Cashier of the store fixed his eyes on me. I noticed him doing this, but I didn't care, letting him admire my appearance as I got the snacks I wanted.

As I was paying for my snacks with the few dollar bills I had, the Cashier started to initiate a conversation with me. And this conversation would spark my knowledge of a figure I may be similar to...

"So, you're the Black-Eyed Child, huh?" The Cashier asked me.

"Yep, that's me. That a problem?" I asked rudely.

"No, no. Nothing's wrong with that. It's just... I had an encounter with someone like you." The Cashier spoke with words that caught my attention.

"Like me? Is he a kid like me?" I asked, surprised to hear what the Cashier had to say.

"No, he's not a kid. He's a full-grown adult. Perhaps, too grown..." I could see the goosebumps forming on the Cashier's skin as he said this.

"He had similar features you do. The jet black hair, the snow-white skin, black eyes and veins, those kinds of features. Except his hair is long, covering his face. He was massive. He wasn't just tall; he was all muscle with no fat. He's 7'2" if you're wondering how tall he is... Everyone calls him the Man In Black..." The Cashier sighed as he scanned the last of my items.

"How did your encounter play out?" I asked, tilting my head like a horror movie slasher.

"It was horrible... My wife and I haven't heard from our son for quite some time. We started to worry that he wasn't walking from school for an hour. We decided to track his phone to see where he ended up. We got to one of the corners of the neighborhood..." The Cashier described his first encounter with the Man.

"When we see the Man In Black, we were terrified to see him with our son, battered and bloodied. We were too stunned to speak as he turned to see us with malice behind his smile. He told my wife and I our son was bullying another kid for one month, and he sped away before we could say anything." The Cashier croaked as tears formed in his eyes.

As the Cashier told me his story, I started becoming scaredCashiert would happen next.

"When we ran to our son, my wife gasped in horror, and I was horrified to see him in his state. His limbs were twisted and broken. His shoulders were dangled, his collar bones were snapped, and his ribcage was shattered. All his organs were severely damaged. The doctor told us all this after we called 911 and took him to the ER." The Cashier whimpered and sniffed as he tried to hold back his tears.

I was terrified and disgusted by how graphic the Cashier's story had gotten.

"Do you wanna know what the worst part about it all?" The Cashier asked me.

"When our son recovered from his injuries one year later, he told us that when the Man-In-Black beat him to a pulp, he was conscious throughout the whole process... And when the doctor told us the Man In Black paid the hospital bill, he only did so to warn us that he wouldn't spare our son out of pity again..." The cashier whimpered as he remembered the whole ordeal.

"Jesus... Do you think I would do things as he did?" I was terrified beyond belief, feeling fear consume my body for the first time.

"No... I'm not saying you would do that..." The cashier started sobbing as he covered his face.

A middle-aged man, who I assume is the convenience store manager, put his hand on the Cashier's shoulder to tell him it was going to be okay. He took at me and said this.

"There's a reason how the actions of one person can shape another. I don't care who you are, kid. But no one deserves something like that happening to their child. Someone should teach that Man some humility..." This was the only thing the manager said to me.

I nodded in agreement as I paid for my snacks and walked out of the convenience store.

**If I have the Man In Black encounter me at one point... I'll let you guys know...**
