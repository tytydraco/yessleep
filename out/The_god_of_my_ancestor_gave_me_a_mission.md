My name is Zara, I am 12 years old and I live in a small village nestled on top of a large hill on the border of a lush and gigantic forest. The trees rise out of the dark earth like thick spears, branches and leaves spreading out in all directions to capture the abundant rays of the sun. Our tribe is small but proud. We live off the land, grow crops, and tend to our animals. The days are filled with the smell of the rich earth, the sound of the wind through the trees, and the chatter of our animals. I am the eldest daughter of my family, and my chores keep me quite busy. 

We have a small herd of a dozen black goats, a few golden chickens who try to escape their enclosure way too often, and one crimson cow. I am responsible for feeding them each morning, collecting their waste, throwing the waste into the manure pile, and milking the cow. Our cow’s name is Bina, and she is a kind and gentle beast. As soon as she sees me coming out in the morning, she greets me with a motherly moo. 

Our home is modest but comfortable. The walls are made of clay and straw, and the roof is thatched with reeds from the lake. If you walk inside, you can smell the sweet odor of herbs my mother hangs from the ceiling to dry and the meat roasting on the spit. My father is a farmer of grain, and he works the fields from dawn until dusk from spring to summer. His large and dark hands have become calloused from years of hard labor. My mother tends to the household, and she is always busy with something—whether it is cooking, cleaning, or sewing. 

Now as I said, our village is not large, no more than 100 people, but it is close-knit. Everyone knows everyone else, and we all rely on each other to survive. There is a rhythm to our lives, dictated by the seasons. In the spring, we plant our crops—grain, barley, and vegetables. In the summer, we tend to them, weeding and watering. In the fall, we harvest, storing what we can for the winter. And in the winter, we huddle together for warmth, sharing what we have with each other.

But life in our village is not without its hardships. There are times when the rains do not come, and the crops wither in the fields. There are times when sickness sweeps through the village, taking the young and the old alike. We have also seen the ugly face of war, and how it leaves destruction and death in its wake. This land can be cruel, and the gods of this land are no different.

It was late in the fall when my mother gave birth to my brother. The air was crisp, and the leaves had turned golden and red. There was excitement in our home, as everyone anticipated the arrival of the new baby. My father was especially eager, hoping for a son who would be his heir.

The day my brother was born was a day of great joy. My mother’s labor had been long and difficult, but when the baby finally arrived, all the pain and worry seemed to melt away. He was a small, fragile thing, with a shock of dark curly hair, light blue eyes, and a piercing cry. My mother held him close, tears of joy streaming down her face. My father beamed with pride as he held my brother for the first time. 

We named him Yamin, after my grandfather. He was beautiful, and we all doted on him. My mother spent every waking moment with him, and even in her sleep, she held him close. My father would come in from the harvest just to watch him, a look of gratitude on his face. And I, too, was captivated by him. I would hold him in my arms and smell his smooth skin, it smelled like a loaf of freshly baked bread. Our hearts were full.

One morning, we were all awoken by the sound of our tribe’s priest screaming for everyone to come to the village square. The urgency and glee in his voice was something that I had never heard before, and it truly unsettled me. We scrambled out of our skins, prepared our clothes, and ran to the village center. Soon, we all met in the village center, standing before our priest. The priest was wide-eyed and grinning from ear to ear. He wore a long black goatskin tunic that went down to his ankles. His skin was tattooed all over with the symbols of the gods he served, the ink black as night. He also wore various animal and human bones around his neck, on his wrists, and on his feet. 

“Our gods came down and visited me in the woods last night.” he shouted with mirth. “They say that they grow hungry. Do you know it has been over 100 years since they came down last?” He looked around at the crowd as gasps of shock and shouts of joy escaped from the villagers’ lips. The priest then looked fixedly towards me and my family. “You all will honor the gods with an offering, and it will bring us into many blessed years of prosperity.” The priest broke eye contact with us and pivoted to the  others. “The offering will take place in one week.” he said before walking hurriedly away. The almost silent volume level while the priest had spoken remained even after he was gone. 

I looked around at my tribesmen for any indication of how I should feel. As my eyes scanned the crowd, I noticed the elders were all staring at my family. It caused great unease in me. 

That night, I overheard my parents talking, and I began to understand. My father’s voice was low and despondent. “My grandfather told me that the last time the gods came down, the babe of Daat was offered.”

My mother’s voice was trembling and cracking. “How can they ask this of us, our only son…?” My mother then lost her composure and began hysterically crying and hyperventilating.

“The gods have spoken,” my father replied, as he hugged my mother, his tone heavy with resignation. “We have no choice.” I couldn’t hear anymore. I slowly crawled away into my sleeping skin. I felt hot salty tears pouring down my cheeks and choked out a whimper. “Blessings can’t die like this.” I said to myself as I escaped from the horror of my reality into the warm embrace of sleep.

The day of the ceremony arrived in haste. The sun was just beginning to set when the whole village assembled in front of the altar. The priest was dressed in his red ceremonial robes and held a gleaming bronze dagger in his right hand. My mother clutched Yamin to her chest, her eyes wide with fear. My father stood beside her, his face pale and drawn.

I watched in horror as the priest began to cut his own flesh with the blade all over his body. He proceeded to flick the blood onto us, the altar, and the idols. “We are here to offer you what you desire!” the priest yelled.  The priest walked over slowly to my mother and reached out to take Yamin. She cried out, but the priest ignored her and yanked him out of her arms and pushed her to my father. My mother began uncontrollably sobbing. “We have to do this,” my father said, his voice choked with emotion. “We cannot anger the gods.”

I could not bear to watch. I turned and ran, my heart pounding in my chest. I heard my name being shouted by countless voices, but I ignored them all. I ran through the village, down the hill, past the fields, and into the woods. The trees closed in around me, their branches reaching out like arms, trying to hold me back. But I kept running, tears streaming down my face, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

I cursed the gods as I ran. How could they be so cruel? How could they demand the life of my baby brother? I wanted nothing to do with them. I wanted to be free of their cold and twisted tyranny.

I don’t know how long I ran, but eventually, I collapsed to the ground, exhausted and trembling. The woods were silent around me, the only sound I heard was the beating of my broken heart. I lay there, curled up in a ball, sobbing uncontrollably. 

The woods were thick with shadows, the dwindling light barely penetrating the canopy above. The air was cold, and the ground beneath me was damp. My mind was consumed by grief and rage, swirling together into a storm that threatened to tear me apart.

I don’t know how long I lay there, but eventually, I became aware of something—voices, distant but growing closer. Panic shot through me as I realized someone was coming. I scrambled to my feet, my heart racing. My first thought was that the crazed priest had come after me, to drag me back to the village. I couldn’t let that happen. I had to run, but my legs felt weak, and my head was spinning.

I turned and tried to slip deeper into the forest, hoping the trees would hide me. But the voices were even closer now, and I could hear footsteps crunching through the leaves. There was no time to escape. I pressed myself against the trunk of a large tree, holding my breath, praying that whoever it was would pass by without noticing me.

The voices grew louder, and I could make out words now, though I didn’t understand them. They were speaking a language unfamiliar to me, choppy and gruff. I peered around the tree, and my heart sank as I saw them—a group of men, dressed in furs and carrying spears. They moved swiftly through the woods, their eyes scanning the trees as if searching for something.

I shrank back, my heart pounding in my chest. These were not men from my village. They were from a rival tribe, one we had long battled. “What are they doing so close to our territory?” I thought to myself. I had heard stories about them—stories of stolen animals, cruel raids, and burning hatred. I knew if they found me, I would be in grave danger.

I moved my foot so that I could turn around and run in the opposite direction, but I felt the sickening crack of a dry branch loudly breaking in two beneath my foot. One of the men stopped suddenly, his head snapping in my direction. His eyes narrowed as he scanned the trees, and then he barked out a command in his strange language.

The others stopped, turning to look where he was pointing. My heart froze as I realized they were going to find me. There was no escape now. The men formed into a line, spears raised at their belly. I felt a wave of terror wash over me, my legs shaking so badly I thought I might collapse. The men started singing a frightening melody and jogging towards where I was, bronze spear tips gleaming in the dying light.

But just as the men were about to reach me, a bone chilling howl reverberated in the distance. The howl was followed by the distinct sound of countless paws running on the wet leaves. The men froze in their place like statues.

Behind the group of men, a pack of at least a dozen grey wolves emerged. They looked slender and were hungrily licking their chops. The alpha wolf in the center was the size of a small bear and looked to be the survivor of a dozen battles. He intently eyed the group of raiders. The men stumbled back, their spears shaking in their hands. 

The alpha let out another guttural howl, this one even louder, and the men turned and fled, running away from where I was hidden. The wolves began the chase and I began to hear screaming. That snapped me out of the trance that I was in, and I turned around and ran as fast as I could, leaping over roots and ducking under branches. I had put some distance between the wolves and I, because I could hear the screams, howls, and tearing sounds getting more muffled. The anxiety was starting to leave my body, and my feet felt lighter. Alas, in my moment of relief my foot slipped on a mound of wet leaves. I was airborne for a few seconds and hit my head hard on a dead tree trunk. Everything went black.

A dull ache throbbed in my head, and I slowly became aware of the cold, damp ground beneath me. It was pitch black now. 

RESTART HERE: My body felt heavy,  weighed down by exhaustion and pain. Faintly, I heard the rustling of leaves and the soft panting of animals.

I felt a tongue rough, wet and hot, licking my cheek. I instinctively shut my eyes, and my heart skipped a beat. “The wolves found me, I’m dead.” I said to myself. I was filled with dread, but accepted my fate. I felt another one sniffing at my hands and whimpering softly. Another began biting on my feet, the sharp teeth prickling my skin through my leather shoe. The one sniffing my hand then let out a loud bark. My eyes shot open instantly and my hands reached out and touched smooth short fur. These were the village’s search hounds. A wave of relief washed over me.

I tried to push myself up, but my arms were weak, and the pain in my head flared up, forcing me back down. The dogs began barking even more frantically, their excitement growing as they continued to nudge and lick me, urging me to move.

“She’s over here, they found her!” a voice called out. The sound of hurried footsteps crunching through the underbrush followed, and soon, several figures appeared, parting the trees.

It was the village’s search party—men and women carrying torches and ropes, their faces etched with worry and exhaustion. Among them, I recognized my father. He rushed forward, dropping to his knees beside me.

“Zara, thank the gods!” he breathed, his voice trembling with relief. He touched my face gently, as if reassuring himself that I was real. “We’ve been searching for you for hours. We feared the worst.”

I had the overwhelming urge to bite him in his face like the wolves I had just encountered. He let the priest take away my brother, but all I managed was a weak smile. “I… I’m sorry, Father. I—”

“Hush,” he said, his voice shaking as he pulled me into a tight embrace. “There’s no need for apologies. We’ll get you home now.”

The other villagers gathered around us, their expressions softening with relief as they saw I was alive. Some murmured prayers of thanks, while others simply nodded, their eyes filled with compassion. But beneath their relief, I could see something else—a deep and consuming sorrow.

My father helped me to my feet, supporting most of my weight as I leaned heavily against him. My head spun, and I felt weak and unsteady, but with his help, I managed to stand. 

“We must get her home,” my father said to the others, and they all nodded in agreement. The search party began to move, the dogs now circling around us as we made our way back through the forest. The path was rough and uneven, but my father held me steady, guiding me with gentle words and a firm hand.

Finally, we reached the edge of the village, and I saw the familiar sight of our homes and fields in the moonlight. As we walked deeper into the village center, I couldn’t help but notice that something was different. 

In the center of the square, where the altar had stood, was a small mound of earth, freshly turned. My breath caught in my throat as I realized what it was—a grave, marked only by a simple stone.

My legs buckled, and I would have fallen if my father hadn’t caught me. “No…” I whispered, my voice trembling with disbelief. “Yamin…”

My father’s grip tightened around me, and I could feel the tension in his body. “Zara, we… we had to,” he said softly, his voice choked with emotion. “The gods would have blessed our enemies and destroyed us for breaking covenant with them.”

The words hit me like a blow, and I felt the ground sway beneath me. My baby brother, the tiny life we had prayed so desperately to come, was truly gone. No wolves to save him, gone. The gods hadn’t spared him. They had taken him, just as the priest had promised they would. But instead of me feeling rescued from death, I felt condemned, empty, and destroyed, as though my very soul was rent in two.

I stumbled forward, breaking free from my father’s hold, and made my way to the grave. I dropped to my knees beside the mound of earth, my hands trembling as I reached out to touch the cold stone that marked Yamin’s resting place.

Tears streamed down my face, blurring my vision as I whispered his name, over and over, as if saying it enough times could somehow bring him back. But the grave was silent, and the only response was the soft rustling of the wind through the trees.

My mother approached, her face pale and drawn with grief. She knelt beside me, her hands covering mine as we wept together. I could feel the deep sorrow in her, the same pain that had taken root in my own heart. We had lost Yamin, and nothing would ever be the same again.

The villagers stood silently around us, their heads bowed in respect. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my father gently lifted me to my feet. “You must sleep, child,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “Let’s go home.”

I nodded numbly, allowing him to guide me away from the grave. My mother followed close behind, her steps slow and heavy. When we reached our home, my father helped me inside and laid me down on my bed skin . My body was exhausted, but my mind was a whirlwind of emotions—grief, anger, confusion, and a deep sense of helplessness. 

I could still see Yamin’s tiny face in my mind, his bright eyes full of innocence and wonder. And now, he was gone, taken from us before he had even had a chance to run, ride, or love.

As I lay there, staring up at the ceiling, I felt a heavy darkness settle over me, a despair so deep that I wasn’t sure if I could ever climb out of it. 

That night, sleep came in a way it never had before. I found myself standing on the shore of our vast lake, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and the soft whisper of waves lapping at the shore.

The moon, hanging low, cast an eerie glow over the water, making it shimmer like liquid silver. The surface of the lake was unnaturally still, as if time itself had paused.

I stood barefoot on the cool sand, the grains pressing against my skin. I looked out over the water, feeling a strange sense of calm. Then, in the distance, I saw a figure. At first, it was only a faint shadow, barely distinguishable from the darkness around it. But as I watched, the figure grew clearer, closer. My heart began to race, not with fear, but with a sense of anticipation, as if I knew—deep down—that this moment was important, that it held the answers I sought.

The figure moved with a grace that seemed almost otherworldly, each step sending ripples across the glassy surface of the lake. He was walking on the water, his feet barely disturbing the stillness, as though the lake itself welcomed his presence. His form was tall and strong, but shrouded in a cloak that billowed around him, blending into the shadows. 

Despite the strangeness of the dream, I felt no fear. I stood rooted to the spot, unable to look away as he continued his silent approach. Finally, he reached the shore, stopping just a few paces away from me. He removed the cloak from his head and looked at me. He regarded me with a look that was both tender and profound, as though he understood the depths of my pain and confusion.

“Zara,” he said, the weight of all the worlds in his voice. 

“Who are you?” I said, my voice barely a whisper. 

The man smiled and said.

“I am the maker of Heaven and Earth and the God of your ancestors. I saved your ancestor Yafeth and his family from the Great Flood in the Ark. However, with each generation that passed after that, fathers and mothers slowly stopped telling their children who I am. Eventually, your ancestors began to worship gods of wood and stone, which have no life. They turned away from Me, their creator and exchanged my glory and worship for abomination upon abomination. Their minds and hearts became darkened.  Your brother’s blood is screaming out to me from the ground. I will do justice upon the Earth.”

I took a shaky breath struggling to comprehend what was just told to me. “I have never heard of you…and I don’t even know your name?” I asked, my voice trembling. 

“My name is wonderful, and I cannot tell you it. The time has not yet come. Yafeth called me God, and there is no other god beside me.

The man stepped closer, his presence both utterly comforting and overwhelming my very being. I bowed down in worship. “I’ve chosen you, Zara,” he said, his tone gentle yet firm. “You will remind your people of the true God, the Almighty God who loves justice and righteousness. Although the sins of your people are great, I will forgive whoever comes to me and forsakes the darkness. You will remind the people of my ways. Walk before me and be blameless.” 

I began to see images of all of human history flash before me: the past, present, and future. I felt like a lump of clay before the potter. His words brought fire into my soul. I believed Him. I loved Him.

“What would you have me do?” I asked my creator.

“I have a task for you. When you wake up, arise and go to the altar of your people. Smash the altar, destroy the idols, and remind the people of who I am.” God said.

The thought of destroying the things that had taken my little brother away from me filled me with an exhilarating joy, but I felt a sharp twinge of fear at the consequences.

“I… I don’t know if I can,” I admitted, my voice barely audible. “The priest… the villagers… they’ll kill me.”

The man’s expression remained calm, his eyes filled with understanding. “I am with you wherever you go,” he said. “Just as I ensured that the priest put his blood on you so that the wolves would smell it and arrive just at the right moment to save you from the raiders. My arm is not too short to save.” 

He reached out, placing his hand on my lips. The touch was warm, and a sense of peace washed over me, soothing the fear and doubt that had taken root in my soul. 

“See, I have anointed your mouth to speak life. Now, arise and fulfill your purpose, Zara. I am with you.”

My eyes opened, tears flowing, to the call of the rooster. The god who had walked toward me on the lake had spoken and I was forever changed. His words echoed in my thoughts as I dressed quickly, my heart pounding with determination. I walked over to my father’s tool box and grabbed his axe, as he and my mother still lay sleeping.

The village was still quiet as I stepped outside. No one was outside yet. My steps were hesitant at first, but as I passed the mound, the memory of Yamin’s sacrifice strengthened my resolve. There will be justice on the earth.

The area of the altar was illuminated by a row of torches kept perpetually burning. The idols loomed before me, their carved faces staring down as if they held some great power, grotesquely jesting at me. Intense fear started to boil inside me. All of the stories I was told as a little girl of those who defied the gods and their horrible fate swirled around in my mind, trying to stifle the flame I was given. “No!” I said to myself, steeling my resolve.

I reached out and touched the largest idol, a towering figure of dark wood. Its surface was rough under my fingers, but it felt no different than any other piece of carved wood I had ever touched. It was a mere object, not a god. 

With a deep breath, I pulled back the axe and swung it with all my might at the idol’s head. It fell to the ground with a thud, as it’s nose flew off. I completely lost control of my body and felt a strength I never knew come upon me.  I started relentlessly chopping at the idol’s head, 

with savage blow after blow 

STOP: until I cut the head clean off of the body. I grabbed the other smaller idols and started smashing them against the stone altar. Dust, pieces of wood, and broken stones began peppering the air. I broke the torches and began igniting the broken idols at my feet. The splinters caught fire first, and then the bodies went up in purifying flame.

I heard shouts behind me. I turned to see the villagers rushing into the square, their faces a mix of shock, confusion, and anger illuminated by the growing fire behind me. I saw my mother, father, and sisters along with them. I heard a shrill cry louder than the rest come from the back of the crowd. The priest wide eyed and enraged, pushed his way to the front of the crowd.

“What have you done?” the priest screamed, his voice seething with rage. His gray beard quivered as he pointed an accusing finger at me. “You have profaned this sacred site and desecrated our gods!”

I stood tall, though my heart was pounding within me. “These gods did nothing when I destroyed their altar and their images! ” I said, my voice steady as the fear slowly died within me. “They hold no power. The true God, the God of our forefather Yafeth, has appeared to me and shown me the truth. We must turn away from these false gods and follow Him, the true and living God.”

The priest’s anger only grew at my words. “Blasphemy!” he spat, stepping forward with a sneer. “You have been deceived, girl! These gods have protected us for generations! You were visited by an evil spirit sent to destroy us by our enemies.”

The crowd began to close in, their fear of the gods outweighing their doubt, not even my own family was immune.“She must pay for her crimes,” the priest declared, his voice cold. “She must be killed to appease the gods.”

The crowd murmured in agreement, their hands reaching for stones. My heart raced as I realized what they intended to do.

Just as the first villager raised a stone, a low, menacing growl cut through the air. The crowd froze, their eyes widening in terror as a massive figure emerged from the shadows. A huge, dark, tawny lion approached us, massive teeth bared.

The priest faced the lion, his expressions shifting from anger to fear. The lion let out a deep roar, a sound that shook the very ground beneath us, and the villagers started scattering in a panic. However, the lion’s gaze was fixed on the priest.

The priest raised his hand and screamed a death curse at the beast in the magical language. The lion moved with a terrifying grace, paws rhythmically hitting the ground before he leapt through the air and connected with the priest’s body. His screams filled the air, but they were brief, cut off by the lion’s powerful jaws.

When it was over, the lion stood in the center of the square letting out a piercing cry of sadness. The priest lay still at his feet. The villagers were even more silent, their fear palpable as they stared at the scene before them.

The lion turned his gaze to me, bowed his head, and sprinted back towards the forest, leaving the village in stunned silence.

The villagers remained frozen, unsure of what to do. The authority of the gods had been shattered, lying there burning and broken along with their priest. 

I took a deep breath and stepped forward, my voice calm but firm. “The true God, the God of Yafeth, has protected me,” I said, addressing the crowd. “The gods you worship are false, and they were unable to protect their priest or themselves. You must turn away from them and seek the one true God who made Heaven and Earth.”

An older man, one of the elders, stepped forward, his brow furrowed with skepticism. His voice was gruff as he addressed the crowd, but his eyes were fixed on me. “What trickery is this?” he demanded, his voice carrying over the whispers. “Our priest is dead, our idols destroyed—but how can we know this is not some sinister sorcery?”

A few villagers nodded in agreement. Another villager, my relative, her face lined with years of hardship, spoke up, her voice trembling. “We’ve followed these gods our whole lives, this God whom you speak of has never appeared to us like our gods have to our priests?”

My heart tightened at her words. The village had been steeped in idolatry for so long that the truth was difficult to accept, even when it was staring them in the face.

I looked at the elder, then at my relative who had spoken, and finally at the rest of the villagers who stood in uneasy silence. “I understand your doubts,” I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. “But the power that destroyed the idols and struck down the priest is not dark magic or sorcery. It is the power of the true God—the God of our forefather Yafeth, the one who delivered him from the Great Flood.”

“She’s bewitched by our enemies and commands animals to do her bidding by black magic.” someone else shouted. The crowd began to shout in approval. My heart started to falter within me. “They don’t believe me.” I said to myself, crestfallen.

A voice echoed softly in my mind, clear and unwavering. “Your brother is sleeping, go tell him to wake up.” My breath caught in my throat at his words. The image of Yamin’s small grave, the fresh earth still piled above him, sent a shiver down my spine. 

I hesitated, my mind reeling at the thought. To stand before Yamin’s grave and speak those words felt impossible, almost absurd. Yet  I found myself moving before I even realized it, my feet carried me the few paces to that cursed mound.

My throat tightened with emotion as I knelt before Yamin’s grave, the soil cool beneath my hands. Tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision. I took a deep breath, steadying myself, and then spoke those words.

“Awake, my brother,” I whispered, the words feeling strange and powerful on my lips.

For a moment, there was nothing but silence, the world holding its breath. My heart pounded in my chest, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts and doubts. 

And then, piercing through the stillness, came a sound that should not have happened—a strong, clear cry, the unmistakable wail of a newborn. My breath caught in my throat as I stared at the grave, my eyes wide with disbelief. 

My hands trembled as I reached for the soft earth. I dug frantically, the soil giving way beneath my fingers. The cries continued, strong and vibrant, each one filling me with a mix of fear, hope, and overwhelming emotion.

The earth shifted beneath my hands, and then, suddenly, I uncovered a small, wriggling form wrapped in a cloth. My heart leaped. I removed the cloth and beheld him—Yamin, my brother, his tiny body scrunched up as he wailed with the fierce, demanding cry of a newborn. He was alive, his chest rising and falling with each breath, his limbs flailing as he protested the cold air.

Tears streamed down my face as I gently lifted him into my embrace. His cries softened as he felt my warmth, his tiny fingers curling around my thumb..

I cradled him close, my heart swelling with a mix of joy and disbelief. My brother, who had been taken from us so cruelly, was now in my arms, alive and well. His cries filled the air, a sound of life, of defiance against the darkness that had sought to claim him.

As I stood, holding Yamin to my chest, all my tribe had fallen to the ground in shock. Among them was my mother, her face pale and drawn, her eyes wide. 

I walked toward her slowly, every step feeling like a dream. The villagers parted with looks of reverence and awe on their faces. 
When I reached her, I gently placed Yamin in her arms. She stared down at him, unable to believe her eyes, her hands shaking as she touched his soft cheek. Yamin began crying hungrily.

She lifted him to her chest, and began to nurse him, her hands still trembling. The shell-shocked expression on her face slowly gave way to one of fragile hope as she cradled him.

My father stepped forward, throwing off his amulet onto a burning idol. “For the God of Zara, the one who raises the dead, may he forgive us” he said solemnly. That day, everyone in my tribe stepped forward from the youngest to the oldest and cast their old life into the fire.

Our God makes all things new.
