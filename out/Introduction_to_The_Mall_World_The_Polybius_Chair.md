There is an abandoned mall that has been kidnapping runaway teens since 1982. I only know about this because my dad's friend worked there in the 90's and we were subjects in their experiments.


Back then they were called Mann Technologies. A company out of Japan that opened up a large office right next to an abandoned mall in the rural south of the United States. What they did there I still have no idea but what I do know is they were experimenting in the 90's or creating a device for teens for recruiting without kidnapping subjects. 


When I was a kid my family was always short for cash and when my dad's friend David told him about a research study for my age range that paid $1000 for an overnight study at his lab he signed my sister and I up. Back then that was a lot of money and would help my family out alot.


I was excited. I was told it was a new video game that we would get to play. What they didn't tell us was that this technology was being developed by the CIA and the primary goal was recruiting soldiers to become spies. 


What they discovered though was much more than they had hoped. Their original studies had been with another company in the 70's, TavikTok Industries. They had created what has long since been called The Polybius Machine. Long rumored to have been their way of kidnapping runaways to join them at the place now called Camp Hero in Montauk, NY.


That's where they began work on a chair that would allow soldiers to fight remotely. Basically they were creating human spy satellites utilizing some wild tech discovered by German scientists in WW2 which was later stolen by the USSR and then smuggled to America. 


This was just the tip of what they uncovered. They found a realm in what many New Age people might call the Astral realm. With this chair it would amp up those with the abilities to cross into the Astral realm and navigate basically anywhere they wanted. The problem is they could also create things there with their minds. They also weren't the first ones to tap into this place. 


They knew of the creatures that lurked but they had no idea. So with their new tool, their plan was to get people strapped for cash to send their kids for a night into the astral realm. The children would be sedated but when they woke up they would have imagined a wonderful journey at the mall overnight. 


The problem is the mall also existed in the Astral realm and something Mann Technologies had never experienced was about to happen. 


My sister and I were super stoked to be going and we could barely contain our excitement on the ride there. David had picked us up from our house and we were ready for an adventure. It felt like winning an award. Turns out it's was more like winning years and year of psychological torture.  


We arrived and were placed in a room with toys and a TV show playing. I remember between various cartoons, all the commercials were for locations in the mall. The weird part was it was almost like they were subliminally giving us instructions without us knowing. 


Soon men in uniforms came to pick up my sister. They assured me we would be joining each other soon for our mall adventure. The first part was a test. They came and got me next and proceeded to take me to a room with what I would later know as a two way mirror.


A very nice lady came into the room and began to ask me odd questions:


How often do you dream?


Have you ever had dreams where you control them?


Have you ever met someone in a dream you were sure was another person?


Have you ever seen a creature in a dream the felt like was hunting you?


Have you ever conjured something terrible in your dreams?



The questions got stranger but I started to lose consciousness during this moment. The Lady called in the gentleman who had escorted me. The last thing I remember was being put into a chair facing a glowing looking mirror. I vividly remember the mirror seemed to be glowing from inside and it almost looked like a door. 


The next morning I woke up in a parking lot. A parking lot for a mall that hadn't even opened yet. My sister wasn't there. I went to the closest payphone to call my parents. It was the most scared I had ever been in my life. 


When the phone answered I could hear the panic in my father's voice. I began to tell him I'm not with my sister and I'm in an abandoned parking lot. I recognized some street signs and rattled them off to him. That's when it all started. My truest nightmare. 


My dad and mom arrived at the payphone and followed behind them was an ambulance. My father approached me and gave me a hug. Told me how worried the whole family was. I kept saying where's my sister. We need to find her. 


That's when my jaw dropped.


"Son, you've never had a sister. You ran away from home last night while your aunt was babysitting. How you got all the way out here, I don't know. You don't have a sister. These nice gentleman here are going to take you to the hospital to get checked", he waived the men over as they proceeded to put me in the back of the ambulance.


Session 01 - Patient 27 - 07/13/1995



Dr. Salazar: 

Would you like to tell us what happened to you?


Patient 27:

I told you I have a sister. We were going to do a research study and I woke up alone. 


Dr. Salazar:

You have no sister. No records ever indicate you have ever had one. Why are you lying to me?


Patient 27:

I'm not lying. Something happened in the mall.


Dr. Salazar: 

Nothing happened in the mall. 


Patient 27:

You are lying.


Dr. Salazar:

Maybe. Does it matter. What's done is done. Security we have an unruly patient. Send him to the room. Send him to the Polybius Room. Maybe he can find his sister there.
