Last night, I had a dream so strange that it’s still lingering in my mind. It wasn’t just an ordinary dream—it was one of those that leave a strong feeling behind, even after waking up. What made it different was the moment I somehow realized I was dreaming. Normally, this realization would excite me, but this time, instead of simply enjoying the experience, I felt an overwhelming urge to tell everyone around me that I knew it was a dream.



As soon as I spoke those words, something changed. The atmosphere shifted in an unsettling way, and suddenly, eerie images started appearing around me. They weren’t outright terrifying, but their randomness and the way they emerged made them deeply disturbing. It was as if the dream itself didn’t want me to be aware that it was a dream, and by acknowledging it, I had triggered something sinister.



One image that truly haunted me was of a figure with a head shaped like a clock. At first, it seemed like a strange and harmless concept, but in that dreamlike state, it was incredibly unsettling. The ticking sound coming from its head grew louder and more intense, blending with an overwhelming sense of dread. It wasn’t just the sight of the figure that disturbed me—it was the feeling it carried, an unexplainable heaviness that filled the entire space.



No matter where I turned, the dream seemed to react to my awareness, warping itself into something darker. The people around me, who had seemed normal before, started behaving oddly—some staring blankly, others whispering things I couldn’t quite understand. It felt as if I had broken some unspoken rule of the dream world, and now, I was facing the consequences. The air itself felt thicker, making it harder to move, as if the dream was trying to trap me inside.



Then, just as the eerie feeling reached its peak, I woke up. But even after opening my eyes, the strangeness hadn’t fully left me. Without realizing it, I found out that i was pulling the skin under my eyes to wake myself up, almost as if I was trying to shake off whatever had lingered from the dream. It was such an unnatural reaction, something I’d never done before, which made the whole experience even more unsettling.



Even now, hours later, I can’t shake the feeling that something in that dream was trying to reach me. The clock-headed figure, the eerie whispers, the thick air—it all felt deliberate, as if the dream wanted to show me something I wasn’t ready to understand. something about that dream was different. I’ve had strange dreams before, but this one carried a weight, a sense that it wasn’t just meaningless fragments of my imagination, Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks, a collection of subconscious fears manifesting in strange ways. Or maybe, just maybe, dreams aren’t always as random as we think.


PS…but to be honest, if i had the chance to do that again, i think i will.
