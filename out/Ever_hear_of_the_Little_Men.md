I hear they haunt people who've been bullied.

They're tiny, look like gnomes but they're not. They have snowy white beards and red pointy hats and practical blue trousers. They carry automatic rifles, mostly AK-47s they got from Afghanistan after the Soviets pulled out in the 80s.

Like I said, if you've been bullied, you might have already heard them. They only haunt people who really believe what their bullies say about them, or who believe they deserve to be bullied, or who tell themselves they should be bullied. Only people who have really and truly given up on themselves, might first hear the Little Men.

First you hear their laughter. It sounds exactly like you'd think. Like high pitched hyena shit. Like deformed demon children. Or something scary and fucked up like that.

You'll hear it just out of sight. Around corners. Behind doorways. Under your car (if you have one). Just over the horizon. They'll be laughing because they're amused by your suffering. They just have to let it all out. They'll laugh so hard they'll wheeze.

Before long they'll start fucking up your life. Doing little petty stuff like pissing in your gas tank and pissing on your clean laundry and pissing on your laptop and pissing on your cat and turning your toothbrush upside down in the morning so you go to use it and brush your teeth with the plastic end and it fucking hurts and now your gums are bleeding but you didn't notice that it was upside down because you were really tired because you get up at 5 am to go to a job you can't stand and why aren't you rich yet UCAKF

Once the petty pranks have started, you need to start believing in yourself again. Stand up for yourself to the bullies. If the Little Men see you've grown a spine, they'll bounce because they're all secretly huge pussies. They have strength in numbers (some say there are trillions of them, since they exist in the fabric between dimensions and you know how much space there is in the fabric between dimensions) but that's all they have. It's why they carry the AK-47s.

If you don't, though, prepare for the next level.

You'll hear them chant.

*Little men. Big guns. Pointy little hats.*

Once you've heard the chanting, it's too late. You'll hear it just like you heard the laughter, in random spaces, just out of sight.

You'll hear it more and more. You won't be able to explain it away. Then you'll start seeing hints of them. You'll see a little hand flipping you off from under the bureau. You'll see a little foot sticking out from under the curtain. You'll find their little footprints everywhere. You'll find little white whisker hairs everywhere.

Then, when the time is right, they'll come for you.

You'll be shocked how many of them there are. They'll point their guns and say "Put your hands up," and of course you'll comply cause who doesn't in that situation?

They'll pick you up and carry you on their tiny hands all the way back to Disneyland. But this isn't the Disneyland you're thinking. Oh, no. This is Disneyland in *Anaheim*.

You'll stay there with the Little Men, eating nought but popcorn-flavored cotton candy and drinking nought but half-melted slushies with barely any syrup in them. The temperature will always be 88 degrees and muggy. You'll ride the same rides every day but the lines will be 4 hours long and when you get to the gate the ride will close for maintenance and the Little Men will be laughing laughing laughing all around you.

No one knows how long this goes on but it sounds like nothing you'd want to fuck with.

So believe in yourself.

Or else.
