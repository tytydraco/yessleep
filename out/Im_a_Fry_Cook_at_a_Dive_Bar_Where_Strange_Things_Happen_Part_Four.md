The next time I saw Henry. I was watching him pick the lock on the back door of the bar. “God damn it Henry,” I whispered while sitting in a motel parking lot across the street. I felt dread as he finally unlocked the door and stepped in. I got out of my car and crossed the nearly empty street. It was early in the morning, a few hours after the bar had closed. I tried to avoid the light coming from the street lamps. I didn’t want Henry to happen to glance out and see me approaching. My dread increased with every step I made toward the door Henry disappeared through. I kept trying to find an excuse for what he was doing. I was horrified to find comfort in the idea that he was just stealing from the business and not bringing about the things that kill employees. When I finally reached the door my head was swirling. I slowly grabbed the handle and centered myself a little bit.  
I slowly opened the door and peeked inside. The door opened into a little room the size of a closet. There were doors on the left and right walls. To the left was the bar and dining room. To the right was the kitchen and dish-room. All the lights were off as I stepped in and carefully closed the door. It made a small thud as it knocked against the doorframe. I winced then I heard it. To me it sounded like I just slammed it closed. 

I glanced between the left and right doors. I was straining to hear any hint of Henry’s location. As I stood there, I began to hear quiet whispering coming from the direction of the kitchen. I slowly walked up to the kitchen door and peeked through its window. I could see a silhouette standing by the fryer. I hesitated…I could stay and watch what he was doing or I could run in and stop him. I thought of his last encounter with the thing in the fryer grease. A cold sweat broke out on my head and my stomach dropped at the thought.  
I decided I needed to save Henry. I pushed the door open and ran around the expo counter that was between me and him. I slipped when I tried to speed around the counter. I slipped, crashing into the one of the stoves. My head bounced off the corner of it before falling to the ground. I looked up, my vision blurred. I felt a sharp pain in my head with each beat of my heart. The room spun as I saw Henry standing over the fryer. It was bubbling again. Henry was whispering rapidly. It was rhythmic like a chant. I tried to stand but vertigo kept me from getting up. Even with my vision blurred, I saw Henry lean back. “NO!” I shouted and tried to get up again but failed. Henry practically dove into the oil. His head disappeared into the fryer.   
There was a short pause before Henry pulled his head out of the fryer. His head whipped back, his hair flinging oil everywhere. The skin on his head and neck was blistered and peeling. Blood poured out of multiple places where his skin was sliding off his skull like melting butter. Henry’s shrieking seemed distant to me. I don’t know if it was from the concussion or from the shock I felt. Henry scratched at his face, peeling flesh from bone. He fell to his knees looking at the pieces of his face in his hands.  
His screaming became hoarse as he destroyed his vocal cords. I watched him fall quiet and slumped forward. His head collided with the floor and slid, leaving a trail of gore. I struggled to my feet, using the line counter as support. I staggered over to him and fell to my knees next to him. Tears dripped from my face as I examined the damage. Blood slowly spread from his head. I reached down to feel his neck for a pulse. I almost fell over again…there was no heartbeat. skin peeled off as I removed my fingers, causing more blood to poor out. I still can’t put into words the soul crushing pain I felt while sitting over Henry’s mutilated body. I noticed his arm was bleeding as well. I gently lifted them up and flipped them over. They were covered in deep gashes that seemed to form symbols that ran down his arm. I checked the other one and it was the same. I was filled with rage. I did do the only thing I could think of. I stood up and began to yell at the fryer. I swore…I spit…I screamed…I cursed the demon in the fryer with all my soul. The oil lay still. It didn’t bubble or swirl. I felt ignored, which only fueled my rage. I kicked it over and over and over again. I ignored my vertigo as well as the hot liquid that flew out and burned my exposed skin on my arms. I screamed and kicked until my voice was hoarse and I was gasping for breath.   
The vertigo finally overwhelmed me and I fell to the floor. I curled up and began to sob. It was all I could do. Eventually, my cries turned to sniffles. I slowly pulled my phone out of my pocket looking at the dent I left in the body of the fryer. I made a call to the police. I don’t remember what I said. At that point I was on autopilot. After I knew they were coming I hung up and stared at Henry’s body for a while. After a few minutes, I sighed and stood up. I bent down and gently placed my hand firmly on my friends shoulder, “I’m sorry I hesitated.” I tear up again as I stood up and staggered out of the bar, leaving Henry's body behind.   
I sat in my car and watched as red and blue lights illuminated the side of the building. A single squad car pulled in and parked by the back door. I saw two officers exit the car and rush up to the door. They ran in as an ambulance pulled up. It seemed like the EMTs waited for the officers to check the building. I suddenly felt really tired. I tried to fight off the encroaching darkness but it was no use. The concussion was finally overtaking me. The last thing I saw was the police walking out and waving away the EMTs. After that I slipped into the bliss of darkness that came with a dreamless sleep.
