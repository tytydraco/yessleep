**Hey, Earth.**

How has it been back there?

I'm James, and I've been in an alternate world for 2 months. I'm not gonna tell you my last name, for reasons that, obviously, don't involve personal things. I guess you can know I'm in my early 20s. I'm not great at putting my life into text and also make it not have filler, so I may skip some boring pieces. I might also not :)

I can't remember much of how I got here since, you know, being in a dimension with hideous creatures, even seeing my friends as monsters, so cut me some slack. However, I do know this; It's getting better here. I'm only gonna share the first days right now, since I may be traumatized, but my mom said I was a witty little rascal.

she was right.

I'll begin now, at the start, where this all began. Kind of. I can't remember, remember? wait, I don't. ^(lol). Listen, this will be an end to a long story (the story of how I even ended up in the woods) and then I'll end up here since I just remembered this. Alright, here you go.

(My earliest memory of not being in this universe)

As I trekked over logs and sticks, with some roots in between, Oliver silently went with me. I even forgot about him for a moment.

And then, just as I forgot about him, Oliver finally spoke.

"Do you really think... that we'll find them, James?"

Oliver said while looking at the ground with a glazed over look as we trek through the sticks and trees, leading nowhere as leaves crunch under his and my shoes. You see, Oliver was depressed. Very depressed. He wore gray sweatpants and a dark purple sweater, his brown hair falling in front of his also brown eyes

"Oliver, of course we will. Kendall found them, right?" when I said that, I quickly retracted. Kendall had died a bit ago back then. I forgot how, of course.

"Yeah, and she went missing a day a day later when-" Oliver said, slightly irritated that I brought her up. as he spoke, his words got mixed and fused together, repeating themselves and in some times, going backwards, as if my mind cut them off and tried to make sense of his movements. However, something weird began to happen. My vision blurred as i stared at him and he stared back, and a strange string of symbols stood out from my blur, and forced it into my mind, imprinting itself into my memory. I'll write what I saw at that moment.

"5|-|3 \\/\\/3|V7 84(X 70 7|-|3 574125. |-|32 80\[)7 \\/\\/45 |=0(\_)|V\[) \\/\\/17|-| |-|(\_)|V\[)23\[)5 0|= 814(X, 8100\[)7 7214|V9135 1|V |-|32 80\[)7 219|-|7 |V3><7 70 7|-|3 574125. \_|4|\\/|35, 1 |V33\[) 70 7311 70(\_) 50|\\/|37|-|1|V9... 1 X1113\[) |-|32. 1 \[)1\[) 17. 1 (42\\/3\[) 7|-|3 7214|V9135 1|V70 |-|32. 5|-|3 |=0(\_)|V\[) 0(\_)7 480(\_)7 |\\/|7 53(237. 1 X|V0\\/\\/ 70(\_)'11 11\\/3. 4|V\[) 1|= 70(\_) \[)0 23|\\/|3|\\/|832 7|-|3|V, \_|4|\\/|35, 7|-|3|V 90 (\_)|\* 7|-|3 574125, 4|V\[) |V3\\/32 (0|\\/|3 84(X. 7|-|15 \[)1|\\/|3|V510|V \\/\\/111 83 \[)3572073\[) 70\[)47, \\/\\/17|-| 3\\/3270|V3 1|V 17. 4|V\[) 1 (4|V'7 137 70(\_) 90 \\/\\/17|-| 17."

I have no idea what that language is. I'm guessing Leet-speak. It's been two months without progress on finding it out. Someone translate that as soon as you can.

"Yeah. guess so..."

After another half-hour of walking, I looked up from the ground, and spotted it. A set of stairs, leading to nowhere of course and ending in a straight drop. By now, we had not a single clue of where we were, but at least we found what we wanted. The stairs were sturdy and made of something, I currently don't remember, but I know it was grey so probably cobblestone. It had large blue walls that made it so you couldn't see someone of average height in the staircase. If I were to guess, I'd say it had around 20 steps. Me and Oliver admired the stairs, looking at it from the side.

"Told you we'd find one, Oliver."

"I stand corrected..."

We stood there for a moment. Oliver seemed to stare at the drop of the stairs. Maybe someone he knew died there... "I bet you 20 dollars you wont climb the stairs completely." Oliver said, sounding somewhat challenging.

I wish I looked into his eyes to see his tricks beforehand.

"Aight, bet." My past self spoke, walking to the front of the stairs.

I looked up at the stairs and the tall walls. Damn, I was off by 1 step.

21 steps.

I felt Oliver tap my shoulder, a shudder goes down my spine. Oliver goes in front of me, holding two glasses of water.

"Here, let's have a drink of water before you do this, eh?"  
He said, holding out a medium sized glass of water for me and one for him. Him, being my friend, I take the glass.

"Sure, why not."

I wish I looked into his eyes to see through his tricks again.

I smiled, taking the glass. I was about to drink it, and so was Oliver. Until I saw the water. My water was a bit white, I'm not sure how to explain it. It looked salt-water-ish, I guess. Oliver's water looked normal. I can't believe I didn't expect what was coming next.

As I drink the water from my glass without thinking of where he got it, so does Oliver, a smile on his face. Now I knew something was up, he never smiled like he was then. He was off...

Fuck, I think he spiked my drink. I can't feel my limbs. I fall weakly to the ground, Oliver standing above me for a moment. He grabbed a rope from behind a tree. This motherfucker planned this. He tied the rope to my feet and tied my feet together. I remained conscious throughout. He walked up the stairs with the rope, then jumped off the edge with the rope, yanking me to the stairs. My head hit the stairs repeatedly, but i couldn't care about that less. I tried to scream, but my body refused to. God fucking dammit, Oliver couldn't even bother to speak to me while he dragged me up the stairs. finally, I reached the top, but he didn't stop. my body dragged and finally, I felt my body dropping. My body flipped. the grass was bloody and red below. Oliver's body was laying against the grass, a hole through his head.

I regained control of my body. I screamed, standing up and stepped away from my former friend's body. I felt my heart through my entire body, Oliver's clothes bloodied and torn, a giant claw mark against his back. His eyes were just as lifeless as when he was alive. I didn't see much of them though, since the hole punctured directly between the eyes. when I look up, I see the sky. But not the sky I used to know. It was a dark red color, almost like a maroon, but much more insidious... The sun was gone, and yet and unplaceable light source still covered the ground not below trees. the grass was still green... but the trees. The fucking trees.

They were made of fucking meat.

Bones and muscles replaced what would be bark and branches, but the leaves were normal. Everything was alive here... I heard a groaning sound from the closest tree to me. It sounded like a dying horse... Then I noticed something. Oliver's face was fucking gone, straight from his fucking body.

What the fuck? Where did his face go? I just fucking saw it!

The creature made a noise that was a mix of tongue clicking, bone cracking, and gurgling. It was horrifying. Then, it spoke, trembling...

"J-james... It's me... its me... Please... don't leave... m-me... i... i am h-here... James... Hu... hues..." It spoke, struggling and gurgling as it slowly made its first step.

What the actual FUCK

it knows my fucking last name, not even Oliver knew it. The only person who I know knew that was a friend back in pre-school. I didn't want to find out what it looked like. This motherfucker had Oliver's face, and I don't want to know what it did with it. Screaming wasn't the best choice I assume. I saw one leg come from the shadows. it was bloodied fucking femur. A motherfucking femur. I saw bits of skin patches across the bone. I almost vomited, feeling nauseous. I didn't care where I went, I just wanted to get away from this thing. I ran until my legs went numb, jumping across logs and roots and passing giant trees. I saw a cave, quickly running to it, muttering profanities to myself. I climbed up rocks to a tiny entrance to the dark cave, falling down to the ground. After waiting for any sounds, I fell onto the ground, tired as shit. I fell to the cold rock floor, my eyes heavy as I drifted in and out of consciousness. I can't stand it anymore, i was running for what I assume to be hours.

I laid in the spot of light peering from the hole above the rock blocking the majority of the cave's opening, I knew that I may die in my sleep.

But at least I wont die like Oliver or from that thing.

I checked my phone before deciding to sleep. Almost dead, shit. If I want to document my story if I survive, I'll need to see if electricity exists, and see if i can get some wifi or power

(Check-in from current James, yes, I did.)

I lay my phone in my pocket, and I pass out.

I hope my mom misses me.

(Welp, that's what day one consisted of. I'll update when I charge my device. Power is super slow here, but I'm lucky there is in the first place. I'm currently in my house in this universe. I'll explain how in my followup if I survive long enough to get up off my ass and begin writing once more, lol)
