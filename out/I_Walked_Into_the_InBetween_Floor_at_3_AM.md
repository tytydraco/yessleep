I used to laugh at urban legends. Shadowy figures, cursed buildings, secret floors—just stories people tell for fun. But after what happened last night… I’m not laughing anymore.

It started at 3:12 a.m. I remember the time exactly because I looked at the clock right before I sat up, wide awake, heart pounding like I'd just been yanked out of a nightmare I couldn’t remember. There wasn’t a sound. No sirens, no knocking, nothing unusual. Just a heavy, sinking feeling in my chest—like the air in the room had turned into water and I was slowly drowning in it.

I couldn’t shake the sense that I needed to leave. Not to run away, exactly—but to go somewhere. Like something was calling me out into the hallway.

Half-asleep and completely unsettled, I opened the door to my apartment—and instantly knew something was wrong.

The lighting was off. The usual bright, flickering fluorescent bulbs had been replaced by something duller, yellowish, and cold. Shadows clung to the ceiling. The walls looked... longer. Like the building had stretched while I slept.

Still half-convinced I was dreaming, I stepped out and walked toward the staircase at the end of the hall. But when I turned the corner—there were no stairs.

Just a hallway I’d never seen before.

It extended far beyond where the stairwell should’ve been. The floor was carpeted in a pattern I didn’t recognize. The walls were lined with dozens of identical doors, perfectly spaced. No labels, no numbers, nothing to indicate where any of them led.

I should’ve turned back. But I didn’t.

I told myself it had to be some weird maintenance access or a part of the building I’d just never noticed. But the deeper I went, the harder it became to move. Every step felt heavier than the last. Like the air itself was pressing down on me. My breathing turned loud in my ears, and even the sound of my footsteps seemed swallowed by the corridor.

I tried a door. It didn’t budge. I tried another. Same thing.
Then I felt it.

That unmistakable sensation—like something was behind me. Watching. Waiting. I turned around slowly, and that’s when I saw it.

A figure.

No face. No eyes. No mouth. Just skin—smooth, pale, stretched tight over a long, humanlike frame. It didn’t walk. It floated, silently gliding inches above the carpet as it moved toward me.

My body refused to move. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t breathe. I felt like I was being pulled apart molecule by molecule, my thoughts disintegrating. The thing kept coming. No sound. No expression. Just a horrible presence that pressed into every corner of my mind.

Then, through the panic, a memory surfaced.
The tenants' whispers.
A story passed around like a joke, but always with a nervous laugh.

The In-Between Floor. A place that shouldn’t exist. A trap.

I squeezed my eyes shut and backed away. One step, then another, then another. I didn’t stop, didn’t look, didn’t breathe until I felt something familiar—the cold metal doorknob of my apartment.

I opened my eyes.

I was back.
The hallway was normal. The lights were bright again. The building felt... real.

I slammed the door, locked it, and didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

That should’ve been the end.

But ever since then, something’s been wrong.
Each night, the hallway outside my apartment feels different.
Like the shadows last a little longer.
The silence stretches a little deeper.
And the door I don’t remember being there is getting closer.

One step closer.
Every.
Single.
Night.
