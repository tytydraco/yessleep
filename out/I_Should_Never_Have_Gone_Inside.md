I'd explored abandoned buildings before, it was a hobby of mine, the mystery, the legends, the idea of light rays shining threw a broken window, it all drew me in, but this particular building made me rethink my interests.  
  
I'd been exploring the building for a solid 30min, it was an old mansion there had been story's of people hearing voices coming from inside, but that didn't stop me, i never believed the story's that made me explore mainly because all of them had been duds, anyway i was trying to open a stubborn door when all the noise just ***stopped***, complete silence, the chirping of the birds, the sound of cars passing by, they were all just ***gone***, its like the world outside had just ***disappeared,*** even the dust reflecting the light seemed to freeze in place, the air felt heavy, like a car was on top of me, than out of the corner of my eye i saw something move, i turned to see what it was, and just like that the sound was back, the birds, the cars, even the dust seemed to regain motion.

I immediately scanned my surrounding looking for anything, at the time i tried rationalizing what just happened, the silence? "an acoustic flaw in the building, a dead zone or something" i told myself, the thing i saw in the corner of my eye? "trick of the light" i told myself, but still i felt an overwhelming sense of dread, after i went back to trying the door, i wasn't going to let that ward me off, eventually i got the door open, a book shelf had fallen in front of the door, the door handle being rusty didn't help either.  
  
After i was done exploring the room which turned out to be a guest room, i started to look for the source of the thing in the corner of my eye, despite my best efforts i couldn't rationalize it, when i left the room i saw a bookshelf tipped over that i swear was upright a few minuets ago, at this point it was getting dark i had started exploring at evening and i expected this to take awhile so i brought a flashlight, i was looking around when i heard a noise, i turned my flashlight toward the sound, than i saw ***it,*** bright glowing eyes, along with long sharp claws that wrapped around the corner of the wall, i didn't stick around to see more of it, i immediately turned and ran back to the guest room.

I slammed the door shut behind me immediately barricading it with furniture, i was in a cold sweat after seeing it, at first i was relieved that i got away, but then i realized that i was stuck, after that i listened for anything, the silence felt impossibly long, but than i heard it, distorted screams and growls it was faint at first but it was getting louder and louder, eventually it was right outside the door, it was banging the door i thought it was going to break it down, but than it stopped, it was still there but it was like it was looking for a way in. Whatever it was it was ***not*** happy i got away.

I was catching my breath when i heard a loud crash, than i looked over to the boarded up window, where i saw those familiar glowing eyes, when it realized i saw it it immediately started banging against the window trying to break through, i had to find a way out, i couldn't go thorough the main door as it would take too long to move the furniture i had placed in front of me, the vary things i had used to protect myself are now putting me in danger, i quickly scanned the room, i saw a door leading to what i hoped was a hallway, i tried opening it but the door handle was rusted, the thing was almost through so i started kicking the door trying to open it, luckily the wood was rotted making it easy to get through, it wasn't a hallway liked i hoped, my hart sank, but than i saw it, a hole in a wall, but that thing had made it through.

I didn't hesitate to run through the hole, there was no time to, it wasn't a large hole though so i has cut myself on a sharp piece of wood, i looked behind me and saw that it couldn't reach me, i took a moment to look around, i was in a dark hallway, i didn't recognize the are, i assumed it was an area behind a door i couldn't seem to budge, before i could catch my breath i heard a loud bang, that thing had broken through the wall, i immediately ran hoping the hallway lead to an exit, i looked behind me to get a better look at it, it was giant and lanky, along with those long, sharp claws and glowing eyes i had seen before, and its teeth were unbelievably sharp, whatever that thing was it was ***not*** natural.

As i was running i could here its footsteps, they sounded heavy, i could here what i can only assume were the floorboard cracking with each one of its steps, eventually i saw a light an exit but it was closing in, i ran as fast as i could and put as much power behind each step that i could, when i got out i didn't stop running until i got to my car.

I had barely gotten out with my life, if it wasn't for that rotten wood and that hole in the wall i wouldn't have gotten away.  
  
Sometimes when I'm alone that same silence i experienced that day happens again, and i can only hope my mind playing tricks on me.
