Only these two people in particular.


It was around 9 PM one night. I was walking back home after a trip to the convenience store. I didn't expect anything out of the ordinary, as nothing of such nature ever happened to me. All I was thinking about was what I was going to watch on TV, then about five minutes away from my home, a person wearing a thick coat walked up to me and stood in front of me, blocking my route.


They had a strong, determined gaze. I bit my lip and stepped aside, buf they stepped in front of me yet again. A pit formed in my stomach.


"What do you want…?" I asked.


Their lips rolled up, exposing their gums. Blood red with bumps which moved around like insects. Their teeth were the average pearly whites, but then they grew longer, then shorter, like this person could control the growth of their teeth at will. Chills ran straight down my spine.


The hell? Is this really happening right now? What's up with this person? As I thought to myself, it dawned on me that this clearly wasn't a person, but some creature that looked like a person. There were no genetic conditions that this matched the description of.


As I thought about running in another direction, they kicked me in the groin. Pain shot up through me, sending me to my knees on the concrete. Then they grabbed my arm with a painful force and dug their teeth into my lower arm. It stung like hell. I told them to get away from me, but they kept their teeth lodged into my arm. I squirmed around in pain, hoping it would stop. Soon, they let go and stood over me, continuing to give tat overbearing stare.


I got up and sprinted across the street. Without looking back, I ran home, breathing as quick as my steps. Once inside my house, I locked the front door and made sure the other doors were locked as well. No way I was letting that thing in. My heart sank at the possibility of it having seen me enter my house. I closed all my blinds so it wouldn't be able to see me.


After shutting my blinds, I took a look at the bite. It was a little deep, bleeding, and within a dark blue spot. I searched Google for anything similar but found nothing matching its description at all. I showed it to my doctor. He told me it looked like a brown bruise rather than a bite. I was dumbfounded. He told me there was no bite, but I sure as hell could see a bizarre one myself. In fact, I was sure the blue spot had grown an inch by the moment I showed it to him.


I surfed YouTube for any videos of the person… or monster… who attacked me. It had to have attacked other people as well. I found a video titled "Montvale, Virginia beast." In the thumbnail, vehicle headlights were shining on a man with similar blood red veiny gums. It was uploaded in 2022 and had around 200 views. I tapped the video, hoping it would bring me some closure.


The video began with the camera operator filming the beast standing in front of his car, doing its thing of just staring, almost silently threatening to bite.


"What the hell is that?" asked a male voice.


The beast walked out of the view of the headlights. I had chills watching it walk into the blackness of the night. They got more intense as its footsteps could be heard across the gravel. The man hit the gas, speeding down the road. As he began to breathe heavily, a hand punched through the drivers side window, knocking the phone down. Everything was black, but the driver screamed, there was another punching sound… and another… and another… eventually, there was a loud crash and the sound of the engine weakened. The driver grunted as more punching sounds could be heard.


It was assuring to know someone else had experienced the same thing I did. I went to the channel page. This channel had different videos of the humanoids, all titled with different places. Fredonia, Ohio, Palestina, Ecuador, Newmarket, Ontario… it was very interesting, but terrifying as hell. I had never heard anything about these encounters on the news, which was weirder.


The channel was named Niyoti&Joti79. They were two girls from Uttarakhand, India. Their channel had around 400 subscribers, so it wasn't anywhere close to being well known. However, it had what I was looking for. I went back to the Montvale video and left a comment. Here's what I wrote:


"Hello, I love that this channel exists. I've been a victim of this humanoid as well, but in Graham, North Carolina. I would love it if you did a video where you investigate the area, trying to find any trace of the humanoid beast who attacked me."


One week later, they responded. This is what they wrote:


"Sure! We would love to help the best we can. We have medication that treats your condition which we will show in the next video."


I was even more relieved to be given support. Help is exactly what I needed. A video on the subject would give me closure of some sort, which would mean I could feel at least a little bit comfortable again. The medication was definitely promising as well, especially as the blue spot had taken over most of my left hand along with half of my lower left arm.


I waited patiently for their video to come out. I looked at their channel once every evening to see if they had uploaded the video, eager to see what they'd say and do. I even religiously watched their videos, which kept me from going insane. As I did so, the spot grew up my left arm and covered my left hand. Everytime I fixated on it to the point of shaking, I watched one of their videos. It was pretty calming.


Two weeks after they told me they'd help, I checked their channel yet again. They had uploaded a new video.


"Graham, North Carolina beast"


Here we go! I tapped the video, sat back, and focused.


"Hello everyone, welcome to our channel!" Niyoti and Joti said in unison.


"So, NJs, today we will be investigating the alleged case of a beast in Graham, North Carolina," Nyoti said as my comment flashed on the screen for a couple seconds. "As requested by a commenter who was attacked by a beast recently."


"They were so happy to find our channel," Joti said to Nyoti.


"Yeah they were like "I'm so glad you exist"" Nyoti said to Joti. They both smile at each other in a calming way.


"Okay," Nyoti said. "Anyway… now, let's help them with their closure. Before our search team arrives, we will be giving the requester a little surprise."


Joti whispers something into Nyoti's ear. I could only make out last word she said… "alive."


Nyoti smirked and flipped her hair back.


"No… no…" she said, nodding her head. She then turned her attention back to the camera.


"Okay, let's start," she said. She reached for something that was off camera. Taking it into view, I could see it was an orange pill bottle. "What I'm holding in my hand is the antidote for the disease the beast gave you. You may notice a spot growing on your arm. That's the virus growing. It's very dangerous as it's too strong for your body to process. You won't be able to eat or drink anything and will starve."


I hope I can get my hands on that stuff soon. No way I'm starving to death.


Joti smirked.


"What?" Nyoti asks her.


"Nothing," Joti said. "You know…"


"Yeah we're going to show him," Nyoti said, chuckling.


The video transitions to the two sitting on the floor beside a bunk bed. The camera is aimed down at them at a slightly elevated angle.


"So, we have the pills," Nyoti said. "Now we are going to do the pre-investigation thing, which includes watching us take these pills and do important things with them."


Joti shakes her head as Nyoti twists the lid off the bottle. After she finishes shaking her head, she gazed into the camera. It wasn't your average gaze… that gaze was intense. Determined. Chills ran down my spine. It felt just like the one the "beast" shot at me that night.


Hopefully It's just my brain playing tricks on me…


Nyoti takes a pill out of the bottle and places it on the floor in front of Joti. She takes another pill, setting it on the floor in front of herself.


"And now let's start," Nyoti said.


She grabs something that is off camera again. She carries them into view. Two hammers. One which she hands to Joti. The two look down at the pills, position their hammers, then whack… the pills explode across the floor.


Wha-what are they doing? Aren't those pills important?


Nyoti gives another pill to Joti and takes another for herself. The two whack the pills. Those pills explode as well. The repeated this two more times. I was confused, and began to suspect the worst. I began to believe I had to assume the worst, no matter how much I didn't want to. Maybe they needed to do this…? No... This wasn't right.


They continued to smash each of the pills until the bottle was empty, then Nyoti smashed the bottle. She put her hammer down, then so did Joti. They then glared into the camera in the most sinister way possible. They smiled while doing so, then their lips peeled. My heart sunk.


I thought they were well meaning helpful people, but they turned out to not only be monsters, but THE monsters? Are either of them the same monster who threatened me and those in the other videos? I didn't bother thinking about much, as I knew I was going to die anyway. I looked at the blue spot again. It had reached my left shoulder.


I texted my friend, telling him about the beasts. It was the first time I opened up about the beast to someone I knew. He asked me to send him the link, so I sent him the link to the YouTube channel. Two hours later, he replied, telling me when he opened the link, it brought him to a white screen. Then, when he closed the app, most of his apps were gone. When he opened Google Chrome, he was taken to a white page with random letters and numbers. The letters changed languages every second while the numbers turned into weird symbols. His phone got really hot, to the point he couldn't hold it in his hands. He dropped it on the floor and it shattered into a dozen pieces.


I went back to Nyoti and Joti's channel. It was still there. I copied the link, then put it into Archive.org's Wayback Machine.


"Erm. The Wayback Machine has not archived that URL."


I archived the link, but the archived page was of a 404 Error screen. I took a screenshot of the channel, but it never showed up in Gallery. I decided to take multiple screenshots of multiple unrelated random things to see if there was a problem with my phone, but those screenshots showed up.


When my friend came over, I showed him the channel. He told me it was an error screen. I refreshed the page, but the error page remained. I felt alone. I was going to die without any evidence of the existence of those two monsters. I had nothing to bring to the police at all. I bet I was the only one who could see the monsters.


Later that evening, I got a knock on my door. When I answered it, I saw the broken pill bottle sitting on my doorstep. I looked around, unsure of what to do next. My heart was at the bottom of my chest. This was it for me. My anxiety shot up to the point where I was shaking.


Over the following month, I'd get a sinking feeling everytime I walked outside at any time close to sunset. Even standing near the windows would give me the shivers. I'd make sure all my curtains and blinds were closed by sunset. Over that time, the spot covered the left half of my body. It grew at a slower rate than when it started growing, but it began to feel a tad bit thicker and became quite itchy.


At one point, I wondered what Nyoti and Joti were up to. I checked their YouTube channel. Only two videos had been posted since the Graham one. The one following the Graham video was titled "Nuevo Tocumen, Panama" with an image of Nyoti biting what looked to be a woman in her 30s as the thumbnail. The most recent video was of them doing a dance while wearing red dresses. It had nothing to do with the beasts. I closed YouTube, thinking I'd never see the girls again.


That night, I woke up to the sound of footsteps. It sounded like they were coming from the living room.


"Who's out there?" I asked.


The thuds stopped for a second, then they resumed. I had locked all my doors, nobody had a key to get in, and nobody was staying over, so I called the police just in case. After the call, the footsteps got louder and louder. My door creaked open. I had no idea what to do or what to think.


The thudding of their footsteps crossed the room, in the direction of the window. I began to hear a tugging noise. It sounded like whoever was in here was tugging at my blinds. The blinds were ripped off the window and ruffled with. I had a hard time speaking and moving. The moonlight was shining on two silhouettes with long hair. They both tugged hard, ripping my blinds off the window. They began stomping on and pulling the blinds apart. The fact I was visible to any monster that may be outside gave me goosebumps. I attempted to move, but I couldn't. My hands, my arms, my legs, my feet, my head… were all frozen all of a sudden.


And the spot was starting to itch badly again.


I let out a throaty wail, then the sounds stopped. The intruders stood up and turned towards me. Their eyes lit up in a purple glow for a split second, then they silently walked out of my room. Seconds later, I heard my front door creaking open, then being slammed shut. I twitched, feeling the ability to move again. It was reliving, but I was still defeated overall.


I contacted the police. They came over to talk to me, telling me they would keep an eye out for the girls. I still can't sleep knowing the girls know where I live, let alone the fact the spot has grown over half my body… and I'm beginning to feel lightheaded. My nose is stuffing up too. So my fate begins…


My neighbor just messaged me, telling me she saw two girls leaving my house before a police car showed up in my driveway. I'm not the only one who can see the monsters! But there's no hope for me anyway… I don't know any other way of getting this condition cured.


One last thing… something interesting I found out was that every place Nyoti and Joti mentioned on their channel lined up geographically with one another. I checked the antipode for Graham, North Carolina. It was somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. I noticed the point seemingly lined up with central India. I zoomed in and found Uttarakhand. On Google Earth, I used the grid to see where everything lined up. Every location mentioned on their channel was within the 79th Meridian, or 79° longitude west and east. Either I'm reaching or these two monsters are tied to a couple specific time zones or the 79th Meridian itself.
