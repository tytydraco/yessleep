Thomas offed himself in a most unusual fashion. It is an unspoken truth, and for good reason, but one I feel is necessary to point out. It could have something to do with what's happening.

Of course, his unusual manner of death is not the only unspoken truth. Another is the fact that he died at all. As the story goes, he was found in his "contraption" (that's what they're calling it now) just in the nick of time, and is in a coma for the foreseeable future but is very much alive.

Apparently removing him from that mass of "centipede sculptures" and "snake pretzels" in what his note/manifesto called "the Dollhouse" was such an intense procedure it required the removal of limbs and left multiple first responders catatonic. I'm not supposed to know any of that but I did some digging.

This is all very hard for me to write about, so excuse me if I come across a bit cold. I love him. And it's been a challenging few months. I admit he was suffering so horribly that there was a certain cold relief when he was finally free. That relief is gone now.

The leaves had just started to change when I first noticed something different in the air. He had been hospitalized for a week then. Thomas was a person who always had a very distinct "feel", if that makes sense. One of those people who scratches an itch that no one else can scratch. Even at the height of his "episodes" and whatnot, there was a sense of safety and security in being around him that's hard to explain. Like the universe consists of only the two of you.

That feeling takes on a different tone entirely when you're taking the shortcut through the cold, dark woods at the end of a long night shift, and you feel yourself drowning in it. I could have sworn he was there with me. He had me checking behind trees, even looking up into the stars, anywhere he could be hiding. Did he get out early? Was he surprising me?

I found nothing that night, and that feeling has not left since. It has evolved, however. I can tell it's him, but he feels different. I'm scared, and I'm scared for him.

I did find something a week or so after that.

I was reading a book alone in my apartment. I was feeling sad and nostalgic that night, and had dug up my old copy of *Where the Wild Things Are*. It's a good comfort read in a time like this. But I turned the page and saw a picture I don't remember being in the book. Max was looking right at me, ignoring the monsters around him, and the words simply said: "The doctors lied."

I stared at this for several seconds. I was going crazy. I didn't know what to make of it.

When I turned the page again, it was the same image, but closer to his face, and he had almost a mournful expression, and the words were: "It worked."

What worked? What are they lying about?

The rest of the book was like usual, and I could not find those pages again.

Another month of his coma. Another month of getting used to not having any friends. Other than that feeling in the air, of course.

I was driving home for Thanksgiving, listening to an audiobook. I'll admit it was an old *Goosebumps* book. The first dummy one. Sad and nostalgic again. Holidays, all that.

I had been zoning out in the desert void of the highway when the woman reading the book said, "I am alive and dead."

She said that with great emphasis, and stopped reading for several seconds.

Then, "The experiments continue. Past where I took them. They won't stop. They won't letâ€”"

And she abruptly switched gears and continued to read the book. Rewinding did not find anything and there was a lot of fighting with my family that week.

My therapist thinks I'm just having trouble processing my grief. What I'm really having trouble with is trusting doctors.

All day today I've been thinking about his "Dollhouse". No one told me anything about it. My digging has only led to certain keywords and phrases. But some twisted part of my mind wishes it was me that was found in that "contraption", whatever it was. I hate that he did that. I don't blame him, and I understand, and I hate it.

Through most of my typing this, some voice has been screaming in my head. "Build your own dollhouse! Build your own dollhouse!"

That's just a psychological thing. I've learned how to tell the difference.

They won't let me go, they won't let me pass on, the arms are clawing out for me, clawing out for my soul, clawing out to grab me and pull me free, but the doctors won't let me. The doctors will only hold me here. The doctors have me alive and dead at once and they will not stop the experiment. The experiment I thought was mine is theirs. They will not stop. The arms are clawing out to me and the voices are screeching for me, screeching my name, and the experiment will never stop.

Sorry.

I was dozing off.

I'll leave that paragraph.

I think Thomas wrote that.

To think he went to such lengths to escape his suffering, only for these lying doctors to drag it on, to drag on his suffering forever.
