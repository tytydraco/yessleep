I know what you all are thinking. Animals are weird, unpredictable even, but I just can’t shake this feeling I’ve had.  

 I found her while I was hiking earlier today and she’d looked like she’d been out there for days, maybe even weeks. She wore a mangled collar that was basically a tattered string at this point. I looked at the tag and all the tag said was Daisy. No contact information for any potential owner.

When I found her, her eyes looked, well looked sort of human. Like she had some sort of soul in there. Also something about her just didn’t look right. She looked like one of those taxidermy animals you see in a museum. However , I just chalked it down to the fact that she was probably unwell. 

Like any sensible person would I took her home with me, because who knows how long she would have lasted out there on her own. Especially with winter approaching. I gave her a bath as well as some fresh food and water. I set up a make shift bed on the ground with some spare blankets I had laying around. 

At this point it was getting late, so I got ready for bed. I planned on taking her to the local vet in the morning to have her checked out. Before I laid down, however, I decided to post an ad in a local facebook group. Hoping to reunite her with her owners. I’m sure they have been worried sick about her. I mean she had to have come from somewhere.

After making the post I put my phone down and crawled into bed. I closed my eyes and instantly fell asleep. I woke up to an eerily weird noise. It was a sound I could barely explain. Almost like the sound of a baby crying but not quite. 

I slowly opened my eyes and felt like someone or something was watching me. I turned my head slowly toward the door to find Daisy. She was just sitting there with her eyes set on me. Except she didn’t look like her self anymore. The longer I looked the more obscure she became. Then suddenly her body contorted, it was so unnatural it almost looked like I was watching a video game glitch. There is no other way to describe it.

Unsettled I turned over in my bed, so that I no longer faced the door. At that moment my phone pinged. It was a facebook message from the post of Daisy. My eyes squinting at the light of the screen, I read the message. ‘Where did you find her? Tell me now it’s urgent!’

Hesitantly I responded, telling the woman I found her in the woods near the creek. While awaiting a response I checked the time. Why would someone message about this post at this time of night? Before I could think I got a response. ‘Listen to me please, put that thing outside. That creature is not a dog and you are not safe. Put it outside now and lock all the doors.’

As I read this message I had almost forgot about the strange noise that awoke me. It had stopped. I then glanced at the door to see if Daisy was still there. Except now the doorway was empty. 

Now here I am writing this. I don’t know what to do. What was that message? How do I respond? Do I respond? Was that really Daisy in the door or was it my half awake brain scaring me? 

Call me stupid if you want for typing this instead of investigating further. I just don’t know what to do, I don’t even know what’s happening.
