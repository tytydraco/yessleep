Hello everyone, I'm writing this primarily as a way to note down and document some really terrifying and unexplainable things that have been happening to me recently.

You will most likely not believe me and I won't blame you if you don't

I will be writing this in parts as there is too much to type in one sitting and I have a feeling its not over yet either.

I'll start from the beginning.

My name is Ella Lane, my friends call me El, please feel free to as well, I'd love interact with anyone who is willing to reach out to me, so feel to,  I will respond to as many people as I can.

But anyway, I'm 22 and I'm currently working as a cleaner for a school and the house of a wealthy priest named George Morgans, he's very well liked by the people on our island.

I usually don't see him much as he's never in his house when I arrive to clean it, however yesterday was different and I'll explain why..

I was running a bit late to the Mr Morgans house yesterday, I'd had a really stressful and upsetting last few days after my dog Midnight went missing. 
 my overthinking often gets the better of me but how could he have disappeared when we left him in the house? 

I can't make any sense of it but I hope he comes home ,I'm really worried even if I act like I'm remaining calm.

Mr George Morgans was waiting outside his house for me when I arrived he immediately shuffled over to me and said with open arms 
"I heard about your dog, my condolences for your loss, Ella."

"My dogs not dead, he's just missing. He'll come home, someone will find him eventually." 
He did not respond just kept his arms out as if offering a hug that I did not want or need.

Ignoring that I decided to change subjects.
"Anyways, I'm surprised to see you here. Shouldn't you be out by now? Do you want me to come back later??"

"No. I want you to be here right now but you are welcome to come back later as well if you'd prefer! But I'd prefer you to just come clean now, me being here isn't going to make much of a difference surely!"

"Are you sure, Mr Morgans? It would make much more sense for me to come back later when you're out, like what if you make a mess or something while I'm cleaning or after im gone?"

"Please just come in Ella. There's no point us talking out here! It's cold.
 At least come in and have a cup of tea."

What's the harm in having some tea? I had thought. He's a nice enough old dude, even if he's a bit odd everyone really likes him, so I may as well chat to him for a bit even if I don't intend to stay very long."

"Alright how about this, I'll have a cup of tea for a bit and I'll just clean your house later on, I can make some time in the afternoon to clean your house properly."

"Great! Come in then, I'll go get the kettle!"

I followed him in through into his kitchen as he patted a chair for me to sit on. It was a lovely brown chair with a carving of a happy looking dog on the back.

"Oh I have a chair that looks just like this! It's lovely"

He nodded and smiled warmly at me as I sat myself down.

He briefly left the room and came back just as quickly, which I didn't think to question at the time.

He turned to me with a grin

"I really appreciate the work you do for me Ella. You're a star! Always cleaning my house and never complaining no matter how messy. I know many people think of you as an amazingly perfect woman, with a heart as pure as they come!"

I was quite caught of guard by this, obviously.
 I'm not good with compliments as it is but I did not like the way he was looking at me at all.
Feeling uncomfortable I shifted in my chair and nodded "I-I see. I just do what I'm payed to do. It's not a big deal, honestly-"

He cut me off "Nono I know you put in extra work I've seen it myself. You go out of your way to clean up everything even things I didn't ask you to!
 And you're always in a great mood, going about with amazing and admirable energy, that I imagine is due to your music since you typically dance around a bit! ahaha"

He must have saw my expression of extreme discomfort and confusion, as he immediately clarified..

"Ah, don't be concerned Ella, I should have explained better! ahaha
I have several cameras installed around the house- NOT for the reasons you may assume but rather to keep and eye on things while I'm out the house. Don't worry however, you'll understand soon enough! it's important after all that you see it yourself."

"What the hell are you talking about!??"
I jumped out of the chair and started backing away, something was clearly wrong with him and I just wanted to get away from this immediately.

I sprinted for the door which to my terror was locked, when did he lock the door?
I heard sprinting behind me then felt a bang as everything went black and I felt myself hit the ground.

When I awoke I was sat in the same dog chair but I was in a room I didn't recognise. It was so dark I could barely see anything.
I felt cold but the silence was more disturbing.
I steadily stood up, observing my surroundings.

I walked around for a few minutes trying to figure out where I was, the cold stone floor and echoey sound that was easily made from not only my footsteps but also and most notebly, a distant dripping sound that made me realise there was a small passageway, very narrow but there seemed to be no other noticeable passage way I could notice.

How did i get in here anyway? And where is Mr Morgans?
All I knew was I felt I should go through the passageway and find out where it leads.
I got down on my stomach and started crawling through the passageway, it felt like I had been crawling for ages when I finally saw light in front of me, I was suddenly filled with hope that I was going to get out of where ever I was.

I reached the end of the passageway and into a new room, unlike the other one this one had light in it coming from a random torch pointed upwards which was when I realised two things, I was wearing only a thin robe that hung down to my waist that was really tattered and dirty and a pair of very clean white knee high socks.

I remember almost breaking down in fear, what happend to me? Why am I dressed like this? Where am I? I crouched down trying to collect myself as I felt like if I had to focus on getting out of here and eventually I was able to calm myself enough to stand back up, even if my legs were still shaking a little bit.

I picked up the torch and shone it around the room.
It was all stone and completely empty other than a singular picture frame sitting on the floor in the corner of the room.
It was a dog sitting in a dark corner in front of a latge shadowy figure partially obscured from the camera.
I knew immediately that it was a picture of my dog, Midnight
