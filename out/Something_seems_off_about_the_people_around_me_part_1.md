‘Don’t you think something seems off?’

I stare into the cup of coffee my partner made for me, as the milk dissolves a bit too slowly.

‘Are you sure the milk hasn’t expired? Does it taste okay to you?’

Addison, my partner smiles, taking a sip of their coffee to reassure me.

‘It’s fine, darling. Don’t overthink it. Hurry up, we have to head out soon or we will both be late.’

I nod, feeling my suspicion calm down a little bit, speeding my breakfast process up. I got incredibly lucky to have found such a sweet, reassuring partner, who never judges me for my overthinking. I could wake Addison up in the middle of the night and tell them the most atrocious intrusive thought that’s been eating at my brain, and they will give me a hug and repeat for the millionth time that it’s all in my head and not based in reality. 

Other people, however, aren’t as understanding. My excessively anxious and worried personality has become a subject of multiple jokes from family, coworkers and friends alike. Apparently, a grown man being scared of diving, petting stray animals, ordering food at new restaurants, squashing spiders, and picking up calls from unknown numbers is peak comedy to those around me. Maybe it does look ridiculous, but I’d rather keep myself safe than regret my recklessness.

Addison drops me off at my office building, waves me goodbye and drives off to their workplace, which is not far from mine. At work I keep my guard up probably even more than anywhere else. That being said, as much as I don’t like to admit it, my partner doesn’t get a break from my anxious texts even during our work hours. Usually I am able rationalize my suspicions and calm down after they send me reassuring texts. For example, if Brendan takes a few too many smoke breaks, or if Dean shields his phone screen from others a little too carefully, of course I will take note of it and message my partner my observations. But rationally I will always know that nothing truly suspicious is happening. My partner knows this too, they never freak out about my fears and just keep telling me there’s nothing to worry about, it’s all in my head and not based in reality.

However, today things seem particularly off, unlike usually. Doing my usual mundane tasks, I eavesdrop on Brendan and Dean having a conversation that seems to make sense on the surface level, typical small talk between two coworkers with a few jokes and cliche phrases sprinkled in… right? I listen closer, now looking right at them. Dean’s body language looks a little bit stiff, as if he has trouble bending his joints in a way he usually would. Whatever, maybe he’s just in pain. Maybe he worked out a little too much at the gym. Suddenly, it hits me. I pull out my phone and frantically text Addison: ‘You know how Dean has a stutter?’. 

They reply immediately: ‘Yes, what’s up?’. 

‘He’s speaking perfectly smoothly to Brendan right now…’

‘Aaron darling, are you sure you heard him correctly?’

‘Yes’

‘Maybe he went to speech therapy?’

‘And got these results in one day? Something isn’t right about him…’

‘Please try not to overthink it, it’s for your own mental health. Maybe he really did get his stutter fixed in one day. Please just keep me updated on you and tell me if something else happens.’

I try to let my partner’s words sink in and work their usual reassuring magic, but somehow my fear only intensifies as I listen to my coworkers’ talk, now paying attention to what they’re really saying.

‘I sure do get annoyed with my wife sometimes!’ Dean says with an unnatural cadence, following it up with a rhythmic, oddly paced laughter, sounding out every ‘ha’ with precision.

‘Aren’t you single though?’ I blurt out, now ending up the center of their attention.

‘Don’t you get it Aaron, I was just making a joke!’ Dean responds in that same tone, as if he’s being dubbed by a cheap text-to-speech software. 

It’s not just his stutter, or movements, or tone, it’s his crooked smile that stretches from ear to ear, making his face look like a mask imitating the real Dean. Pure, unadulterated dread starts to creep in and settles in my gut, piercing me and forcing me to sprint to the bathroom to get these feelings out. I lock myself in one of the stalls and stay there until there’s nothing left in my guts anymore, I’m hyperventilating and barely standing still. Granted, I have felt a lot of anxiety, fear and dread in my twenty-five years of life, but this is different. I don’t understand how Brendan seemingly hasn’t picked up on Dean’s odd behaviors, I almost envy his ignorance.

I linger in the stall for a little longer, sending Addison yet another text: ‘Something is definitely off with Dean. I’m taking a few days off from work stating tomorrow.’
