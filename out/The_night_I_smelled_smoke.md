When you grow up with strange things surrounding you, you stop being scared of what goes bump in the night. You start to accept it as part of your life, even when it defies all logic. Although, for an 11 year-old, logic isn’t their strong suit, and I was no exception. My entire life, I have been around the spooky and supernatural, but until that night, nothing had ever shown us that it wanted to hurt me or my family. This is the story of that night that changed. 



Ever since I could remember, I have had trouble sleeping. No amount of medications, scolding, placating, or pretending would help. Hours would go by with me laying motionless, in bed, hoping I could fall asleep before the sun came up. Oftentimes, I’d get in trouble because my parents didn’t understand that I wasn’t purposefully staying awake all night. I lost count of the nights I spent trying and failing to sleep. Even now, I can’t sleep unless I am so exhausted, I can’t keep my eyes open, and even then, I’m lucky to get a few hours before I’m conscious again.  All of this to say, I spend a lot of time awake at the wee hours of the morning. Now on to the story



When I was about 11, my family moved from the countryside to the city. Needless to say, it was a very drastic change for my still developing mind, but I was excited to be near all the hubbub of the city and maybe even finally get to invite my friends over to play. Unfortunately when you live on acres of land, miles away from the city, you don’t get many friends coming over when you’re a child. But I digress, a new chapter was beginning and I was anxious and excited to see what this new place had to offer. 



Nothing felt off when we first moved in, it was your average suburban cul-da-sac at the edge of a largeish city. We didn’t know when we moved there that the entire city had a very long-history of supernatural episodes, but would soon be face-to-face with a terrifying presence and an experience that has embedded itself into my memory that is as vivid as the night it happened, even after almost 2 decades.



Sometime around 2:30-3am, I was sitting on our living room couch, watching tv, curled up with my favorite blanket. I can’t remember what I was watching, but it was enough to keep my attention back then. Before I knew what was going on, I started to smell smoke. As soon as that all too familiar scent hit my nostrils, my head shot up and I began to look around the room. You just don’t expect to smell smoke out of nowhere in the middle of the night, so I feel like anyone would be slightly freaked out at this. 



As I got off the couch, I remember smelling the air deeply, frantically searching for wherever it could be coming from, not sure what I would do when I found the source, but I was determined to find it. 



I should preface this with the layout of our house, so you can understand where my mind went. When you entered the house, you were greeted by an open floor plan. To your left was the living room and the laundry room that led into the garage we had converted into storage and my older brother’s room. In front of the door, you would walk a few feet and be met with a wall that separated the kitchen from the hallway and down that hallway to the right of the front door, you had the bathrooms and the bedrooms. 



So here I am, 11 years old, smelling smoke in my living room, at about 3 in the morning. I use my nose and try following where I smell the smoke the strongest. Before too long, I noticed that I couldn’t smell any smoke by the front door or towards the hallway, it was all concentrated towards the laundry room and garage. Now until this point, I had noticed light coming from the crack underneath the door to the garage, making me assuming my older brother was also awake, given that we had converted the front half of the garage into his bedroom. So opening the door, a plume of smoke started to waft through the house. Looks like I found where the smoke was coming from, but I couldn’t comprehend why the entire room was filled with smoke, especially if my brother was awake, given that he had never shown any interest in lighting things on fire. I don’t even think he liked lighting candles to be honest, I can’t ever remember him having any type of “issues” with fire that would lead someone to believe he would try and light something on fire and just leave it in a room. 



Stepping onto the cool concrete steps leading down to the floor, I looked and saw my brother sleeping soundly in his bed, his tv still on whatever channel it had been on but I was more focused on the fact that the entire garage was filled with smoke. Now my mother was something of a hoarder, but not in a way that you’d ever see if you didn’t go into certain areas of the house. While the front half of the garage was dedicated to my brother’s bedroom, the other half was stacked almost to the ceiling, with boxes. Boxes upon boxes, filled with house items, clothes, personal items, anything my mother didn’t want to deal with at the moment. It was lined up in a way where there was a single path that went to the back of the “wall” of boxes, without leaning up against the garage door. So you could move, albeit not very comfortably between the garage door and the “wall”. 



Standing in the middle of the smoke-filled garage, something told me to go to the back of the “wall” where the garage door was, and low and behold, there was a singular piece of paper, burning on the ground, between the door and the boxes. I don’t know what I thought it was at the time, but I remember stomping on it to put it out before my mother had come rushing in, after the smell of smoke had finally wafted into her room and woke her up. 

Unfortunately I was not the most truthful child, so no one believed me and assumed I had done it to get some kind of attention. To this day, I still wonder what would have happened to my brother or the house if no one had been awake to smell the smoke.
