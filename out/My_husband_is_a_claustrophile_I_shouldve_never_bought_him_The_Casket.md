Of all the kinks and quirks someone could have, it had to be this. But if I can’t accept Clayton’s jagged edges, it’d mean I’d never find true love again.

It took some (read: a lot of) getting used to, especially when he’s the last person you’d expect to have such a kink. I don’t know if kink is the right word though - let me explain.

My husband, Clayton, is a claustrophile. I know, sounds absurd right? And it’s absolutely what you’re thinking. He loves sliding into cramped spaces, almost as much as he loves me. I hope. He’s got his limits of course - he doesn’t enjoy spelunking, while he’s done it a few times. The stone’s too hard and lumpy, and it’s cold, and often wet. He prefers, in his own words, “warm, soft, and in the goldilocks zone between tight and suffocating.”

Ugh, sends chills up my spine just writing it down. That said, it’s kinda hot - hey, make no mistake, I don’t join in on his ‘snug-seshes’. It’s the fact that he’s doing something most would consider either horribly uncomfortable or horribly, well, horrifying.

I’ve been talking about him in present tense again. I’m sorry. Still trying to curb that habit, because Clay is past tense now and I guess I’m coping. Playing make-believe.

We were three years into our marriage, at the time. Our road together had its potholes but, all things considered, I never imagined one person could make me so happy.

But you aren’t here to listen to me being sappy. If that’s the kind of thing that draws you in, you wouldn’t be here. No. You’re drawn in by morbid curiosity.

Clay was a good man. He was kind. Not because he expected anything back, but out of a genuine drive to help others out. Neither of us have ever had particularly well-endowed salaries, and Clay gave to charities all the same.

But ever-present was his proclivity for wrapping himself up tight in duvets, or rolling up in carpets like a human tortilla. Sometimes he’d take naps in the boiler cupboard, a space so small I could never understand how he contorted his limbs to get inside. He never had an accident, but that didn’t rest my worry.

He was so good to me, and I wanted- no, I *needed* a way to show my gratitude. Clay was never materialistic so I had a hard time of it. I visited my mom - who is surprisingly relaxed with Clay’s preference for the enclosed - and she sure had something for me. I still wasn’t certain on what to get him, but what she suggested hit the nail on the head.

Mom has a friend whose boyfriend works for a manufacturer called Cloud Ten - corny, I know. They’re a company that produces a range of leisure products, their most popular being floatation tanks. It would never have crossed my mind that they’d take *commissions* though.

Over the ensuing week I turned one corner of our garage into a think tank, and only went there when Clay was out. In reality, most of the time I spent in my eureka chair was spent procrastinating, and the idea I settled on came on the seventh day, and I could finally rest my mind. Biblical, truly.

Now, I’m not going to lay out all the details of my idea. I even drew out a blueprint, but that turned out more fantasy than feasible. Imagine an iron maiden made of smooth plastic, and a tight, cushioned interior instead of spikes. That sums it up pretty well. I requested the cushioning be moulded to fit Clay’s body, so they asked for measurements. I guess I overlooked that, but Clay had no qualms allowing me to take his measurements. He was especially enthusiastic about the thigh girth and buttocks, the jerk. Still, he never questioned me. Not sure if he expected a surprise, but I know he didn’t expect what came up our drive on a pallet truck.

Oh, and if it wasn’t already obvious, the gift was an almighty sucker punch to my wallet - and I still felt like it wasn’t enough to pay him back for everything. I don’t think he’d want that, anyway, all that hard selfless work just to get something back!

Well, at that point it was just a huge cardboard box. He asked me what it was of course, and I just told him, “it’s got your name on it.” At that, he beamed so brightly I couldn’t help but grin right along with him. It was a lot easier, since we live in a bungalow. We lived in a bungalow.

Clay offered to help the delivery man - not that it was needed - and we were left with a six foot tall package standing in our bedroom.

“Wait here, I’ll run and grab a box cutter,” I said while hurrying out of the room.

“Hey, don’t run with knives!” he called out. I went to correct him and say that applied to scissors before laughing at myself and entering the kitchen, opening the cutlery drawer and finding the box cutter.

Despite his own self-proclaimed warning, Clay was quick to swipe the box cutter and get to work, slicing through layers of duct tape until the box unfolded itself and smacked onto the floor.

The thing looked incredible. I hadn’t seen it in person yet, and up close it was truly something to behold. Six feet tall, its shape resembled a cross somewhere between an iron maiden and a casket. Glossy black resin glittered under the filament bulb. Skirting the edge of its frontside was a tight seam, barely visible, apparently hinged from the inside. The only thing sticking out from this black mass was a small push-down latch on one side.

While it looked crazy by itself, Clay couldn’t hide his confusion, happy as he was to receive anything from me. I gestured to the latch, and without a word he reached out and pressed down on it.

The frontside - a door - released with a satisfying click. It opened by itself, hissing with apparent hydraulics, and revealed the interior. The quizzical look on Clay’s face evolved with every passing second, lifting into shock, realisation, and elation. It was like watching a pirate open a treasure chest, golden light shining out and across his face.

More than simply a cavity, the inside was carefully fitted with cushioning, topped by a soft fabric of some kind, all perfectly moulded to the shape of a man. There was also a secondary, interior latch near the right hand of the mould, so he could exit whenever he wanted.

When he realised what it was, Clay was excited as a kid on Christmas morning, asking my permission to try it between stuttered breaths. I gave him the go-ahead and he turned around, backed up, and fit himself inside. There was a little space around his limbs so it wouldn’t be too uncomfortable (and so he wouldn’t need to get naked every time). He stared at me in anticipation. I reciprocated with a smile and gently pushed the door closed.

Look, I know how weird it sounds. I know it better than anyone. I’d gotten used to it.

I spent the following half-hour on our bed, reading the novella I’d been invested in at the time. After the wait, I heard a click, and the gentle hiss of the door opening. Clay stepped out, and I genuinely can’t describe just how peaceful and serene he looked. Who needs a spa when you’re a claustrophiliac?

He’d go inside almost every day, even purchasing a little whiteboard to draw a schedule on. I did start to think about how exactly it should be cleaned - the casket, I mean. That’s what I took to calling it. Morbid as it sounds, there really wasn’t a better word, but I couldn’t have known just how fitting it would be. Nevertheless, it seemed to be well-ventilated and breathable, and Clay never looked sweaty on the tail end of his sessions.

I didn’t notice any change in behaviour. He was still my husband, albeit a little happier each day, and that joy spread to me. So, I couldn’t have seen what was coming to destroy our lives forever.

It was two weeks to the day when it happened. Clay suggested he try sleeping in the casket overnight. I agreed, reluctantly, but reminded him that he’d better not leave me to sleep alone *every* night. Even for one night, I missed his warmth beside me, his slow, placid breathing.

My eyes opened. Dark. So dark. The walls pressed in on me, a suffocating cavity shaped to perfectly fit my body. They swelled and ballooned and squeezed the air from my lungs, before I felt the pressure on my back release. I toppled backwards, forced from my cocoon, and fell into an endless void of distilled shadow.

I woke with a yelp. My head throbbed and felt groggy. A fine crust of sleep formed in the corners of my eyes, and once I’d brushed it off, I sat up.

Then I frowned.

The casket had been moved in front of the bedroom door. I didn’t really know what to make of it, and a strange anxiety took hold of me. Without taking my eyes off of it, I threw the covers back and stood, pacing my way over and reaching out for the latch.

Something else flooded my veins then. Not anxiety, not quite fear either. A strange sensation of cold and heaviness to my limbs. I reached out, pushed the latch, and heard the door click. It began to hiss open then stopped partway, leaving a gap of only a few inches to see inside.

I still don’t understand what I saw - more accurately, the lack of *anything* to see. The overhead lights were on but it was dark inside the casket, really dark. Too dark. I don’t think it was simple shadows, because that black void started to leak out through the gap. Not in the way smoke might leak from a burning house. It more closely resembled the way blood seeps and spreads through a bandage. Blotchy. Hazy.

Then, something slithered from the dark.

A hand - but it wasn’t Clay’s. Thin with too many or too little knuckles on each finger. Skin with a colour and texture that reminded me of wet limestone, like warped stalactites from the bowels of some deep, undiscovered cave. Soft at a glance, but hard enough to impale with those sharp, protruding fingerbones.

My breath caught in my throat. I tried to take a step back but couldn’t move. My insides felt as if they were being pulled towards the casket. Those unholy fingers reached out, grasping for me, before hesitating. Instead, they curled around the casket’s door in a way that seemed calm and nauseatingly gentle. In one swift motion the door was yanked back into place, and the hand retracted at the last second with whip-like speed.

Only when the casket was closed did I scream. I couldn’t understand what had just happened, what I’d seen.

I managed to compose myself after a few minutes, and began searching for a way out of the room. The windows in our house had those locking handles, and I cursed my choice to keep the master key on the keyrack downstairs. Oh, and they were triple glazed, and there wasn’t anything hard or heavy enough to break through. For a brief moment I considered trying to move the casket, but I didn’t want to get anywhere near that thing. I felt like an insect straying too close to the burrow of a trapdoor spider.

I ended up calling my dad and asked if he was free. He asked why and I told him it’s an emergency, and to come over to my place to help me get out of the bedroom. I don’t know what he was doing at the time but he dropped it and went right out to his truck. 

In the meantime, I curled up on the bed with my spine pressing into the headboard, eyes wide and locked on the casket. It’s hard to say how long I waited. I ignored the flow of time. Any next second could see the casket’s door fly open and that was too much to even consider.

The rumble of an engine made itself known at some point, growing steadily louder until there was a whine of brake pads and the engine shut off. Dad was here. He rapped on the front door once before remembering what I said, and he already knew where the spare key was hidden. I leapt up to peer out of the window. Relief took me as I caught a glimpse of him entering the house and shutting the front door.

At that point I felt a little conflicted. It was hard to tell if I was overreacting or not. Maybe I was dreaming, hallucinating, anything would be more likely than-

I froze. There was a sound, a heavy scuffle of some sort. I whipped around and felt my legs nearly give. The casket had turned a full 180 so it now faced the door. It took a second to parse, but the implication sent a scream out of me.

“DAD! DON’T COME IN!”

He couldn’t hear me properly. His muffled footsteps told as much, picking up the pace until they were right outside the door. My throat went dry. The handle depressed, and the door squeaked horribly on its hinges.

“Lori? It’s open, what’s-”

And those were the last words I would ever hear from my father.

I don’t count the noise he let out after the door swung open, and in turn, so did the casket’s. In fact, it slammed open with such force that the sheet rock around the doorframe cracked and crumbled. A sound like galeforce winds whistling through dead branches, like the scream of so many damned souls, before the casket shut, and there was quiet.

I shouldn’t have. I saw what it could do to someone, but I did it anyway. I called the cops, and they arrived within ten minutes. Dad left the door unlocked and when I heard them call out from downstairs, I answered back.

“I’m upstairs in the bedroom! You have to help me, please!”

They tried. They did their duty, approaching the casket with wary curiosity, but who could prepare for something like that? Both cops were ripped inside. Their screams swirled into a hollow, tinny screech, and dissipated into echoes. Water circling the drain.

I can’t remember much after that. Any memories I have are of me, caved into myself, shivering in the corner behind the wardrobe. I remember gripping something soft. When I realised it was one of Clay’s sweaters I pulled it tight and close and let tears soak the cotton.

Others came. More police, backup, neighbours, even passersby. I yelled at them to stay away but it did no good. It was like the casket, Clay, whatever that thing was inside it, called out to them and drew them in.

I knew I had to do something when my stomach started cramping up. I was so hungry. I’d drank whatever was left sloshing around in my water bottle and my tongue felt like sandpaper and my throat was raw. I don’t know how long had passed, but when I stood up, it was dark out. A dizzy spell hit me and I collapsed onto the bed. In the corner of my eye, I could see it. Still there, still blocking me in. It was facing me again.

All I could think to do was open it. I knew it was stupid. I knew what I’d seen it do. Yet for some reason, I couldn’t help but think that whatever was inside would be better than starving and being left to rot. On unsteady footing I piloted my body towards the casket. Nothing moved. Even when I stood before it, nothing happened. I heard nothing, saw nothing, felt nothing, as if its black surface absorbed its surroundings and dulled everything in its presence.

My limbs acted on their own volition, though they’d been in control the whole time. I’d lost all agency only minutes after waking up. This was just the natural progression. My hand fell upon the latch and pushed it down. In spite of everything, I couldn’t help but appreciate just how smooth the mechanism was, how satisfyingly the door unlatched itself and slowly hissed open.

I expected to see the dark made manifest, like before. Instead, I gazed down a long corridor with walls made of dark grey stone. Igneous, from the looks of it, but it didn’t make any sense. Stepping back, I arched my neck to peer around the casket. The stairs were still there, the landing, my house remained completely unchanged.

Then I looked back inside. How? The corridor, hallway, passage, it looked to extend far further than logic should dictate. Just as I began to second-guess myself, I heard an echo from deep within, rebounding off the ancient rock and rustling the strange translucent roots or vines which dangled from the ceiling.

“*Lori*…”

I couldn’t tell for sure. Was it Clay? Why was he calling out, did he need my help, or was he only trying to lure me in like the rest?

I think, at the end of the day, we’re creatures of emotion, because despite all survival instincts screeching at me, I entered the casket. I’d rather go inside if it meant seeing him one last time before starving to death.

The door didn’t close behind me, which was a small solace. As I went, I let my hands slide across the tight walls on either side. There were odd indentations in it, too exact to be erosion or any natural formation. It was difficult to see with so little light, but what I saw made me pause. Carvings littered the walls, concentric polygonal runes with foreign symbols affixed on their perimeters. I don’t know what language they were, if it could even be considered a language, but one thing I understood quite clearly: they spoke of rites and ceremonies beyond ancient. Older than the worlds that came before us. 

In all those lines and curves, I caught one depiction being repeated. A set of nine spirals, their tails joined, and above that, a tower of jagged lines. A tower of fire? I don’t know. Above the tower was a funnel-like shape with a hazy figure perched on its edge.

“*Lori, please*…”

That one was *much* closer. I squinted, willing my eyes to adjust in the gloom, and saw that the passage opened up ahead into a large, circular room, consisting of not much more than scattered carvings and a great central pit, blackened around its edges as if scorched. The only other feature was a figure, huddled against one wall.

“*Make them stop, shut up! No…*”

As I neared the source of the voice, it became clear to me. A strained rasp of swollen tongues and broken jaws. The thing by the wall looked up at me and I almost screamed. Not because of its disfigured face, but its eyes. Even though there were nine of them, bulging and crowding their sockets, they were Clayton’s eyes, and it was the sheer torment in them that filled me with terror.

I don’t know how he was speaking. His lower jaw and most of his tongue were gone. The top of his head looked like someone had taken an angle grinder to it, I could see grey matter beneath shattered skull. It looked burnt. And his skin… even on his hands, gnarled with too many joints, it was smooth and moist. Like wet limestone.

“*Don’t come… closer… they…*”

Before he could finish, he let out a strangled sound, and something emerged from his throat. No, not from his throat. The dangly bit, the uvula, had elongated to a grotesque extent and snaked out like it had a mind of its own. The end was swollen and bleeding, and had gained a mouth filled with thousands of needle teeth. It slithered around Clay’s head and whispered something into his ear. I couldn’t hear what was said, but Clay started shivering even more, and a hoarse noise rattled in his lungs as tears streamed down what remained of his cheeks.

God, I wanted to run. I wanted to pass out and wake up to find it was all a nightmare. But the reality of the situation set in as Clay continued to sob. I couldn’t do anything else but sit down next to him and hold his nine-fingered hands, skirting the wet, sharpened bone that had grown out the ends.

I found myself crying, too. Still, I forced the words past the knot in my throat, and they were not what I expected.

“You look different. Did you get a haircut?”

I gasped at my own insensitivity. Clay, on the other hand, let out something akin to a chuckle. And I laughed along with him. It was bizarre, to be laughing in a place like that, but laugh we did.

“*I think they went… bit close with the trimmer.*”

My smile fell. Clay had the best sense of humour. I loved him dearly for it. And this was the last time I’d giggle at his jokes.

“How- how can I help you? I need to get you out of here and to a hospital, Clay, I-”

He leaned over and placed a hand on my leg, a gesture that spoke volumes. It wasn’t possible, I knew, and that I couldn’t accept. So, I changed tactics.

“What happened to you?”

After a cough and a sputter, he hesitated, then mustered,

“* don’t know the specifics. They told me to bring bodies, living bodies. They said,*”

He broke out into another gurgling coughing fit, then composed himself.

“...*they said, ‘a soul to Yparchr, dead flesh to Eksuulaghia’.*”

“To *who*?”

“*They wouldn’t tell me. They made me do it, I’m sorry, I tried to resist. Those people, I tore them in two. Ripped mind and spirit from body, and dumped both in*…”

His still-functioning eyes focused on the great pit, and so did mine. Clayton’s next words were the most pained yet.

“*And they’re going to make me do the same to you. Disgusting, disgusting things*…”

Even under duress of such a notion, I stayed still, staring into his eyes. I knew what he wanted to do. What he needed to do.

“I’ll go with you.”

His eyes shot to me and he jerked his head from side to side, flinging spongy curls of brain onto the wall and floor.

“*NO! I- it’s getting stronger. Can’t… fight back… you go.*”

“I don’t want to leave you. I can’t go without you.”

“*Ach… you lived before we met, didn’t you? I’m sorry this is how it ends for us. I can’t go back.*”

“But Clay-”

“*Please. I love you, Lori. I want to love you until I’ve got none left, and it looks like the closest I’ll get to that is making sure you’re safe.*”

My breaths turned shallow and I pulled him into an embrace, ignoring the moist flesh and the stink of it. I leaned back and cupped his head in my hands. Despite his pleas, I still couldn’t accept it. That this was it.

“Isn’t there anything else I can do?”

“*No. They’re too-*”

One of his arms shot out and his fingers sliced deep into my shoulder. It hurt far more than it should have. Blood poured out with a thousand tiny tongues of white fire dancing within. Clay howled and shot to his feet. He staggered towards the edge of the abyss, and turned to look at me one last time.

And the look in his eyes communicated so much more than words ever could. With a grating wail that I wasn’t sure came from him or ‘them’, my husband leapt into the pit, and its shadow swallowed the screams as quickly as it did his twisted figure. 

Seconds of nothing passed by. And then the ground shook. From deep within the hole, a tremendous roar of primordial rage bellowed, and it seemed as if the air itself would kneel in submission. A second noise joined the first that I can only equate to the wispy, piercing wailing of a million dead lungs, a swarm of banshees coming to claim the one who ran away.

The symphony rattled my core and shot me into action. Without a glance over my shoulder I rocketed past the archway that led to the room and barrelled down the stone passage that now seemed tighter than before. The carvings and curled glyphs began to pulse with faint light, and in that light I saw clear intent.

I wasn’t imagining it - the walls on either side now brushed my shoulders as I went. A hundred yards ahead I could see the light of my bedroom and I prayed the casket wouldn’t snap shut.

Rock snapped and buckled around me. Dust and stones clattered at my heels like dry teeth falling from mummified jaws - or, was it jaws snapping at me, the jaws of whatever continued screeching and howling from behind me?

I caught my thoughts before they could run away and set all my focus on reaching the light. Twenty feet. Ten feet. Five feet. And then, the wall to my left shifted. I pivoted at the last moment, narrowly avoiding a crushed arm. It caved and pinned me against the opposite wall and I was stuck!

To be mere feet from life only to stumble at the last moment. Moist, putrid heat spread across the back of my head, smelling like ruptured stomachs ripe with infection. I could hear dripping fluids, twitching muscle and cartilage. It sounded like some great beast was writhing, biting, and grasping for me just inches away from my ear, but I couldn’t turn my head. And thank god, because if I’d seen whatever was behind me I’d have lost all strength and willpower to escape.

My breathing was rapid and my head felt like a hot air balloon. I noticed that when I exhaled I could just about move. After taking several deep, hurried breaths, I forced every ounce of air from my lungs and squirmed forwards. I inhaled, then something large and sharp grazed the small of my back. Something stirred in my head, an awful, dissociated feeling. I screamed, expelling all the breath I’d just taken but in the process giving me room to reach out, grip tightly onto the rim of the casket, and pull my heaving body out.

The floor approached rapidly, and I tried to brace with my arms, but couldn’t. In fact, I couldn’t move at all. I actually heard my nose crack when I made contact, and I must have fallen funny on my left arm as I felt a release in my shoulder, followed by a burst of pain. I hardly noticed though, because whatever was chasing me kept on growling and shrieking.

There, lying prone on the floor, shoulder screaming in agony and blood trickling from my nose, I was sure I’d feel some unearthly limb reach down and impale me. I could feel the heat from before, and smell the stench, but they were cut short with a *bang* and a *click*, followed by a dull meaty *thump*. Then there was stillness.

It was a good few minutes before I regained control of my limbs. When I dragged my knees up to my chest and sat up, I couldn’t help but turn around.

I didn’t scream upon seeing what lay on the floor. I didn’t even flinch, because it was dead. I knew that for a fact, as it was severed at one end and leaking a foul, bubbling fluid. And not just that, but I couldn’t visualise how this *thing* could ever have been attached to a living being. About five feet long - though I’m sure this was only the tip of it - with about five or six knobbled joints. Mottled patchwork skin of festering greens and greys stretched across bone too thin to possibly support its own weight. It terminated in a sort of talon with its end cut off, and a straight black line extending from the hole. Literally, just a solid black line, perfectly straight and without any apparent depth.

It’s been a few hours since I escaped. Nothing else has happened, really, but I found something. We hadn’t yet thrown out the box the casket came in. I was rummaging through it, not sure what I wanted to find (if anything), and tucked between the polystyrene caps was a small, glossy slip of card. I fished it out, and read what was emblazoned on it.

*Approbata per lege de Lucernis Albae et Filii Matris Carnis.*

Which Google is telling me means:

*Approved by the law of the White Lanterns and the Sons of Mother Flesh.*

I could be wrong, but to me, this comes off as an agreement, a pact between two groups, and whatever had been done to the casket on its way here, it fell in accordance with both parties and was ‘approved’.

I’ve also searched the web for anything concerning the White Lanterns or the Sons of Mother Flesh, and haven’t found much other than one or two ancient forum threads containing names that are similar, but not the same, like: White Candles, Children of the Flesh Mother, and a few other permutations. Neither did I find any relation to the Cloud Ten company, nor any rumours about them. I did find a few more names, like the ‘*Aionia Matia*’ and ‘*Cognati Magni Papilio*’ - ‘The Eternal Eyes’ and ‘Kin of the Great Butterfly’, respectively - but they seem to refer to different groups.

It looks like my time’s been cut short, though. A cop car just pulled up outside my driveway, making a total of four. How in the hell am I going to explain myself? There’s that… whatever that thing on the floor is, and the casket’s still here. I hope I’m not here when they decide to open it.

If by some miracle I’m acquitted of any suspicion, then I’ll come back to this post. Please, if anyone has information regarding the White Lanterns, or the Sons of Mother Flesh, don’t hesitate to make a comment. I’m confused and scared and I’m waiting for the grief to finally crash down on me, and it’d bring some comfort to know who the motherfuckers are who killed my husband.

And, word of advice? Stay out of tight places. Especially those where you don’t belong.
