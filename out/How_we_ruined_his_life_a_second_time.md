Ronnie spent the first 19 years of his life underground, and we’re all starting to think it did a number on him.

He never talks about it, but we found out through the news. It was a bad scene, though relatively straightforward. Since he was a toddler, his dad kept him in an underground bunker and convinced him that he was deathly ill and couldn’t come into contact with anyone. That the slightest touch from him could send a wild disease through the other person’s system, killing them within weeks. He even wore a gas mask around him and freaked out whenever Ronnie touched him, making a point to hose himself off even though he was wearing heavy duty rubber gloves. He kept him on a diet of soup broth, water, and fiber crackers. It’s the kind of thing that’s almost funny in the abstract, because who in their right mind would be so cruel to a child, but then you meet the kid and you stop laughing.

His dad is in jail, which you think would put Ronnie at peace, but it doesn’t. Not because he misses his dad or anything, a fact of which he has assured us repeatedly. He’s just a jumpy person in the general sense, most likely because of how he’s spent the rest of his life. We were sure he would get over it. We all met him at the library while picking up a DVD, which certainly didn’t help things when he confided that he was trying to figure out modern appliances. That was another big thing— after the trial and the surfacing and whatnot, he didn’t have any family or friends to go to, and since he wasn’t a minor, he couldn’t be put in a care system. They gave him enough money to get him on his feet, acquainted him with the unemployment office, and now he’s living in a shoebox apartment that is undecorated, which I assume is for the sake of familiarity.

Ronnie was thumbing through an encyclopedia in the library, looking at the pictures, when he noticed me joshing around with my buddies. He was embarrassed and thin and bald, so I tried to smile reassuringly, as I do with most people I feel sorry for. A couple minutes passed before he gathered up the nerve to come and ask me to help him apply for a library card. I told him they walk you through it, but he was bashful and evasive. He took me aside, away from the curious eyes of the woman at the help desk, and confessed that he couldn’t read or write. I was surprised, which I was sure my expression betrayed, but I didn’t shame him for it. The shock was quickly replaced by the understanding that circumstances are circumstances and he probably had a reason, which was good enough for me. I asked him if he knew his name and where he lived, and he said yes. We went up to the counter and I wrote down his stuff for him. 

We’ve been friends since then, and although he’s meshed into our group well enough, I will say it’s a bit like being buddies with an alien. He never lets any of us touch him, and he never puts his hands near any of us. Plus, everything is new to this kid. I think we all figured that it would be like one of those movies where they bring a caveman to the future and he freaks out from all the modern technology, but that wasn’t the case at all. In fact, we even went as far as to show him the “Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer” sketch, but I don’t think he got it. It’s more like he has no base layer for what’s normal and what isn’t, so he accepts everything at face value because it’s all new to him. We once tried to screw around with him while we were watching Star Wars and tell him it was a documentary, but it backfired. He asked us what a documentary was.

There are plenty of things he enjoys doing. He likes going to the zoo a lot. One of my buddies has season passes and another one works there, so we can get in on the cheap pretty often. He likes watching movies that take place outside or in the forest or whatever. He hasn’t learned how to read yet, but it’s not that urgent. We all kind of like him having to lean on us for that stuff. He loves the sun. It was kind of surprising, and we all have to remind him not to stare at it, but he loves the sun. He burns like hell, but he’s obsessed with standing out there during the day, looking at the sky, doing nothing else.

I think things started going wrong when we decided to mess with him.

We all mess with each other often enough that we can smell a practical joke coming, so I think we all figured that Ronnie would be a perfect target because he wouldn’t suspect anything. None of us said it outright, but it was a sort of cosmic conclusion we all reached and agreed upon without much communication. 

We didn’t expect Cindy to go along with it, but she got a kick out of the idea just as much as we did. She said it made her nostalgic, that it reminded her of when we were in high school and she asked the kid with a stutter to prom. Back then, she was kind of an oddity in the sense that she was very pretty and well liked even though she came from a very weird family. Her mom was a basket case and her dad was a doomsday prepper, but she came out totally normal. She was the only girl that would hang out with us, too, so that was always a plus. 

The whole thing started out innocently enough. We figured we would convince Ronnie that Cindy was into him. None of us knew why, particularly, but we figured it would be a funny thing to pull on him. Just to see the look on his face. We had her over once to watch a movie and she sat down next to him like it was no big deal, laughing at all his jokes. She even laughed at the things that weren’t jokes, but in a way that didn’t seem like she was laughing at him, which was a nice touch. She’d try to touch his arm (even though he would maneuver himself out of the way every time), bat her lashes, look away bashfully, like she was really smitten with him. Before she left, she even turned at the doorframe, smiled at him, and said “I really enjoyed hanging out with you, Ronnie.”

He didn’t know what to think. I don’t even think he realized that this kind of attention was anything special, but I figured he knew it was different. We all told him as much. We said that Cindy never really liked anyone, so the fact that she was being so obvious with him really meant something. He had this weird, blank expression on his face, like he didn’t know how to take a thing like that. We told him that he should go for it, but he should be cool about it. He didn’t know how to take that, either. 

Cindy came over a few other times that month, making a point to really come on strong. It was tough not to laugh about the whole thing. Ronnie was such an innocent dude, and he had this total babe laughing with him and whispering to him during the movie. He even tried to flirt back a couple times, which made us almost lose it. He told her that her hair was “really shiny like water,” and that he “liked the gold on the skin of her eyes.” One of my buddies had to leave the room. After about her fourth time over, we put the next part of the plan into motion. We all “left to get ice cream” so that Cindy could ask Ronnie out. She had her phone on speaker while calling me so we could hear everything from the parking lot outside the apartment.

She told him that she liked him. He didn’t say anything. She asked him if he liked her, and he said yes. She asked if he wanted to go on a date with her, and he asked what a date was. Thank God we were on mute, because we were dying. She explained what a date was and he said yes, he’d be very interested, she was so nice and such a good person to look at, he’d enjoy that very much. 

Our original plan was to have them schedule a date, and then once they actually went out, Cindy would be the worst date possible. Rude to the wait staff, untalkative, messy eater, anything you could think of. She would leave while he was in the bathroom or something, and we would show up, say we were in the neighborhood, and ask him what happened. I’m sure we would have eventually told him that it was a prank, but maybe not right away. It was a good plan, and we were proud of it.

Then we saw that cat.

We were all taking a neighborhood walk together when Ronnie, a few feet out in front of us, saw the orange striped cat dying in the street. It might have gotten run over or hurt in some other manner, but it was in a real bad way. It was panting with closed eyes, open-mouthed breathing, back legs sprawled out while it held its front legs close to its chest. I’m sure Ronnie knew it was hurt, but I didn’t know if he knew the extent, or even saw the gash across its chest, pooling red underneath the mussed up fur. We examined the thing silently. Ronnie stepped out carefully, and before we could warn him, he knelt down and put his hand to the cat’s chest.

The cat shot out its limbs and released a piercing, guttural yowl from the depths of its body as soon as Ronnie made contact. Its green eyes went glassy and cold, and once the cry spun out of its throat, it shuddered and went limp. 

Ronnie retracted his hand and stood up. No one else would have noticed, but we saw the way his eyes widened, the way he was gently touching at his knuckles and fingertips like the skin carried something vile. We looked between one another. The thought occurred to all of us. We felt no need to vocalize it.

“It’s alright, Ronnie,” one of us said. I can’t remember who. “It probably wasn’t your fault.”

The one word cemented the idea in our minds, and after dropping Ronnie back at his house with performed discomfort, we got in touch with Cindy and informed her of the course correction. When we explained it to her, for a second, we were worried she had doubts. She screwed up her mouth like she was unsure, like it was too mean, like she didn’t get it. In actuality, she was trying to get a corn kernel out of her teeth, but she found the whole thing hilarious. She, we later realized, approached the whole thing with a lot more humor than the rest of us. As the time went on, we were all beginning to view the plan with a cold sense of calculation, an examination of what actions could produce the “most.” It would be easy to say that we didn’t know what the “most” referred to, but that would be disingenuous. We just didn’t want to say it out loud.

We sat in a restaurant across the street from theirs while Cindy kept her phone on speaker for the whole date. Ronnie was nervous out of his mind, but Cindy turned up the charm to a level that was almost unsettling. There was an inhuman quality to the fluidity with which she moved her arms, how wide she could stretch her lips across her flashing teeth, words spoken with such sincerity that did not belong to her. I imagined that Ronnie was frightened because he was sitting across from a creature he had never seen before. Like he was a being seeing a human for the first time. How terrifying that must have been.

The date ended just as we had planned. They both stood outside of the restaurant, and Cindy stared at him, moving closer and closer like she wanted him to kiss her. He had seen kissing in movies and TV, so he eventually understood the expectation, even if it scared him. He leaned forward and kissed her, and she stumbled back with her hands over her mouth.

“Ronnie!” She said, her voice heavy with shock and disgust. “Why did you do that?”

He took a moment to process her reaction, then apologized. Then again. Then a few times more, trying to explain himself. Cindy, ever the perfect actress, didn’t meet his eye or show any sign to acknowledge he was still there, much less listen to him. She shook her head slightly and looked at the ground, holding her fingers to her lips while he pleaded for her forgiveness, almost on the verge of tears. When she didn’t respond, he reached forward to touch her shoulder. She shrugged him off and straightened out, still avoiding his eyes.

“Okay, whatever,” she said quietly. “I’ll see you later, Ronnie. I guess.” 

We waited a while to pick up Ronnie like we promised we would before he left. He didn’t say anything in the car. We made a point to talk about how cool he and Cindy were and how happy we were that they were going out together. I looked in the rearview to see his expression. The streetlights glinted off his eyes from the window. I didn’t see him blink.

Like we planned, Cindy laid low for a week. Then another. Then another. After the third week, when Ronnie was hanging out with us, she called me. I announced to the room that it was her, and Ronnie looked up, tightening his arms around his stomach. His face carried a sense of nauseous anticipation. I said I was going to step into the other room real quick to take the call, and Ronnie’s mouth opened like he wanted to say something, but he decided against it. 

In the other room, Cindy briefly told me how her day was going, how her dog had to go to the vet, how the guy she was seeing had bad breath. I told her to break up with him and she said that he was nice enough. Eventually she told me that, since her folks were  living in Florida now, the house was free to use. I thanked her, and she said she enjoyed it. I hung up, stood in the room for a moment with my hand over my mouth, and shook off the numb, weightless feeling in my spine.

“Hey,” I said, coming back into the room with a confused, upset expression. “I, uh, just got off the phone with Cindy’s mom.” I looked over the room, landing on Ronnie. “She’s dead.”

“What?” Someone asked, just like we had rehearsed.

“She’s dead,” I repeated. Ronnie’s face didn’t change. He dug his fingernails into his ribs. “Apparently, a few weeks ago, she tested positive for some rare disease. It overtook her system and she was in awful, awful pain for a while. She couldn’t make it. I was also told that the doctor that worked with her isn’t doing so hot either.” I stuffed my hands in my pockets and studied the floor. “He was doing fine until she reached out and touched his hand. That was when the symptoms set in.”

“Did the disease have a name?” Someone else asked. “Or any history or anything?”

“I mean,” I looked up and scratched the back of my neck. “It’s been around before, but the last time it was seen was almost twenty years ago.”

Ronnie leapt to his feet with his hand clasped over his mouth and staggered to the bathroom. After the door slammed, we heard him retching, releasing what sounded like a gallon of semisolid stress into the toilet. We silently applauded one another, pumping our fists, miming the swish of a basketball. One of my friends clapped me on the back and I grinned. I felt like there were rings of lead around my ankles.

We didn’t even have to force anything out of Ronnie. He came clean the moment he was finished vomiting. He told us that he had been uneasy ever since he touched that cat, but he still decided to kiss Cindy, and he could never forgive himself for that. We didn’t forgive him either. We all stepped to the other side of the room and watched him carefully, as if the fabricated disease had formed a solid barrier around his person. I can’t remember which one of us mentioned captivity. The phrase “better safe than sorry” was tossed around. We didn’t use as many excuses as we might have with anyone else. Ronnie still took so many things at face value.

When we drove Ronnie to Cindy’s parents’ place, where her dad kept the doomsday bunker, we held our hands over our mouths and angled our bodies from him. He placed his head between his knees, fingers laced over the back of his neck. When I checked the rearview mirror, I saw his lungs rising and falling at an irregular, shuddering speed. 

He stepped into the bunker like he was meant to be there. It was a dull grey box with shelves of nonperishables and a cheap twin bed in the corner, neatly made with hospital corners and a thin pillow. We all stood frightened at the door as he walked over to the bed, running his fingers over the cotton sheets. We explained to him that we would visit every day, taking shifts to keep an eye on him and give him company. We would bring him outside food and a TV and new clothes, whatever he wanted. He asked if one of us could teach him how to read. We said we didn’t think that would be a good idea. We didn’t want to get too close to him. 

He sat on the bed, spindly fingers with knobby knuckles curling over the edge. He never ate much, I recalled. When he did, it was with caution, like he expected somebody to take it from him. He lifted his gaunt face to look at us once again. He asked us where the toilet was. We had prepared for this question. One of us went upstairs for a second and came back down with a small metal bucket. We apologized. We said that we’d look into getting real plumbing. Something like comfort and dread flashed across Ronnie’s face and he said it was okay.

Now, I will defend myself by saying that the original plan was to keep Ronnie there for a few days, then bring Cindy in and explain that the whole thing was a big joke. Because wouldn’t it be funny if he was introduced to society only to end up back in the same situation he had been in? Wouldn’t there be something so crazy about that? Wouldn’t he have to take a step back and see how absurd the whole thing was, how he just had to laugh? Wouldn’t he finally be able to see the absurdity? Wouldn’t he finally get it?

The same day we brought Ronnie down there, Cindy left to go to Paris with her friends for a month. When she got back, she got a bug on the plane and was out of commission for a couple weeks. By then, it felt like it would be too awkward to bring her down and explain the whole thing to Ronnie. We were used to helping him out, anyway. When we were free, we would take shifts hanging out with him, bringing him food, cleaning out his bucket, whatever. We couldn’t tell if he enjoyed the company or not. He barely spoke to us. He would sit on his bed, hands clutching the side, neck hung low so his face was parallel to the floor. He hadn’t changed his clothes. He even slept in his shoes when he could bring himself to sleep.

One morning when I was getting ready for my shift, I had the gas mask on and the rubber gloves on the counter in Cindy’s parents’ bathroom. I reached for a glove and noticed my tanned forearms, the hair bleached by the sun. The birds were gently and warmly speaking to one another outside. I remembered coming home from the pool as a kid, feeling the cold bathroom tile under my feet while getting dressed. I loved exploring the forest in the summer. I loved feeling the sunburn on the bridge of my nose, squinting against the glare in my peripherals. I loved looking at the dapples of light cast against the trees by the gaps in the leaves. I loved pressing my little palms into the thick pillows of moss on the bark. I would find a spacious bit of grass, no trees, no sticks, no mud, and lay myself out. I wouldn’t look at the sun, but I would look at the sky. I would think of how pretty that blue was. How brilliant and vibrant and thick the atmosphere seemed. The stars poking into view as the night crept in. I would yearn for the feeling of seeing it for the first time. I would tighten my grip on the scratchy grass and brace myself against the earth.

I slid the gloves on and left the bathroom.

Ronnie was sitting in the same place when I came in, but he looked up to see me. I greeted him and looked around the room. Someone had tacked a poster to the wall. It was a creased photo of some forest that wasn’t in our state. I looked back to Ronnie, who had his wide eyes locked on me. He looked at me the same way he looked at the sun.

“How is it out there?” He asked. I flinched, not having heard his voice in days. I said it was fine. No one else was sick. He nodded. His brows furrowed, as if he had to choose his next words carefully.

“It’s been tough to say this,” he spoke slowly. I pressed my back into the wall. “But I wanted to thank you all. You’ve been so kind to me, but you’ve also been honest. I need you to know how special that is.”

I didn’t say anything. I just looked at him, breathing steadily through my gas mask. He didn’t say anything more. All he did was look back at me with the placid expression of someone who had resigned himself to eternity.
