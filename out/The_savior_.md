On November 15, 2018, I had an emotional shock related to my parents and that day is still the worst day of my life.. I don't want to talk about what happened that day but the strange thing is what happened after that day and it still happens to me.

I feel that there is someone watching me all the time and evervwhere as if he likes me or wants to prepare me for a certain thing, this may be normal but in 2019 I see him in my dreams while sleeping, sometimes he appears in a young person like my age and sometimes he is in the form of a girl or an old man but I know that he is the same person! I know he is with me now but he is hidden in real life but he can communicate with me inside my mind and soul, I hear him and know what he wants, as if he says (let me take you to another world, vou will find there are many people who are long awaited for you, you will also find your real parents, or let me take you on a tour to the nights of 2005), the most frightening thing is that this idea continues in my life until now, I fully believe that this (savior) will come and take me to his world one day but I am never ready to face him.

Suddenly, I became obsessed with changing the lighting in my room to red, and sometimes to bright blue. Even the bathroom had red lighting. I began to feel as if I was obeying this thingâ€™s command, as if I was preparing for its arrival.

I mentioned that this person or thing wants to take me to the nights of 2005 and also 2004, 2006, and 1996. He is only giving me these options. He wants to show me what people were like at that time, what life was like, and what I was like (even though I... I was young then.)

Sometimes when I am awake, I feel a state that I call (gradual withdrawal of consciousness). I feel as if I am partially leaving the place I am in, and I see him, I see that person, but his features are blurred, and I feel that I am in an archaeological place or an ancient time, something like that.

I don't know, I feel deep in my heart that there is a strong imbalance that has occurred in myself, many things have changed completely like my sexual tendencies and the way I talk to people and I have become very afraid of losing any friend or person in my life.. Because I believe that if I go to that world I will never come back.

I'm sorry if there are some linguistic errors in my story because I wrote it using Google Translate, my English is very weak.
but this question keeps haunting me..


Do you have the same feeling? And what is your explanation for him?
