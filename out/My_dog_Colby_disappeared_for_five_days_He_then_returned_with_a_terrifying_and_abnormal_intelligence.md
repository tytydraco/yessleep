Those horrifying memories still haunt me. I usually read you know, in fact I only read here, probably just like you. Therefore, if I have decided to write, it is because of the gravity of what unfolded and what could happen in the future if that calamity is not stopped in time.

Everything started when Colby, my labrador retriever disappeared for about five days in June 2019. This spelled sadness and sorrow for my six years old son Danny, because Colby was his faithful friend since his father Neil, a police officer, died in the line of duty two years ago.

One Saturday, Danny and I went to the nearest town for him to get some ice cream. We then returned to our isolated farmhouse, only to find Colby waiting for us in front of the door with his collar in the mouth. There is no words to describe the joy that Danny felt as soon as he saw and hugged his four-legged friend. However, Colby did not reciprocate the affection in any way, displaying the first of many odd attitudes that soon followed. There were so many that anybody could write a book about them, but here are the most disturbing ones according to me: on the next day after his return, Colby obliterated the dog house, and would threaten anyone who tried to rebuild it. Colby would growl and threaten to bite if anybody attempted to use the collar or the leash on him. At least, he proved that it was no longer needed as he behaved himself while I took him for walks. Colby would refuse to play fetch with anybody, even with Danny, breaking the little boy's heart. Neighbors' dogs who used to like Colby and play with him would then antagonize their mate. Colby would also bark back, scaring them away and changing their relation from love and friendship to power and domination. Colby stopped using the pet door, instead displaying a surprising capacity to operate door locks, keys and handles. Colby stopped eating dog food, preferring to go outside each time he was presented his usual meals.

All those events, spanning over at least two weeks only, laid the foundation of the nightmare that would scar me as a human and mother, for the rest of my life.

I have always have been a big fan of the 80's. As a result, from my clothes to the electronic devices I own, you will surely find at least one thing retro. Among my possessions, there was a very old radio that still worked and that I still used, until Colby developed a sudden interest for it. One night, as I was peacefully sleeping, loud and familiar radio tuning sounds awakened me at 2am. I rushed to the living room, thinking it was Danny and ready to scold him. Instead, I found Colby sitting in front of the device, immobile and just listening to static. As soon as he noticed my presence, he slowly turned his head in my direction, staring at me silently. Intrigued, I approached the dog which kept its eyes on me, and when I got close enough, Colby violently barked, and took a fighting position, ready to attack. I placed my hands in front of me, calming him down while stepping back. He just sat back in front of the radio, and kept on listening, ignoring me until I left him be. Colby used the radio almost every night around the same time. On a few occasions, I would see him press buttons in response to certain static noises as if he was communicating with something.

During another night, after using the bathroom before going to bed, I heard Danny talking while he should have been asleep at such late hour of the night. My mom mode activated on the spot and I stormed into his room to confront him.

"Mom! Mom, look, daddy is back, it's Colby!" Danny revealed with excitement, while Colby used its tail to scramble letter tiles on the floor.

"What? What you doing awake at this time of the night? With my scrabble game?" I asked.

"It's dad! He came back for us, he's inside Colby. He can use the letters to talk to us. Come on daddy, show her!" Danny said, destroying my heart in the process. "Come on dad!" He insisted, and Colby just walked out of the room. "Dad!" Danny called.

Even though it was hard to find the right words to calm my son down and put him to sleep, I managed to do just that. That child was still clearly affected by the loss of his father. I left the room with the letter tiles in their bag and put it back on the bookshelf. I then caught a glimpse of Colby outside, sitting immobile in the middle of the yard and under the rain. I approached and stood by the window just to observe him, thinking about how him and our lives took a strange turn since his disappearance and return. As if it sensed me, the dog slowly turned its head in my direction and looked at me, its eyes strangely glowing.

Once more, I decided to let it be and went to my bedroom. The moment I lied down, I heard the radio tuning sounds. That time, after experiencing a traumatizing moment with my child, I found Colby's behavior to be nerve racking. I rushed in the living room and found Colby trying to reach the scrabble game.

"No, this has to stop! All that! Colby stop!" I commanded, ignored by the animal. "Colby? I won't repeat myself again, stop!" I spoke, still ignored. "Stupid silly dog, get away from the shelf and sit!"

Colby kept his position but stopped moving. He looked at me before leaving the shelf as I commanded. He approached slowly, his eyes plunged into mine, then suddenly headbutted the bookshelf with so much strength that it collapsed. That was no accident, that was a statement from him, in two words: make me. I fell short on words and did not know what to do. Before I made any move, Colby lunged at me and pinned me to the floor. I did not know a dog could be that fast and that strong. He growled, baring his teeth, getting them closer to my face by the second. I was sure the beast was about to end me in an instant.

"Daddy?" Danny called, and Colby released me before returning to the bookshelf.

I ran to my son and locked both of us in my bedroom to protect ourselves from that monster. After putting Danny on the bed, with my ear glued to the door, I listened silently to know what Colby could be up to, when he suddenly bumped into the door, making me jump back and scream. I saw his shadow from below the door leaving. My son and I spent the whole night locked in my room. I could not sleep and thought of the many possible ways I could get rid of a pet which became a real danger to Danny and myself. The next morning, I quietly stepped out of the room, armed with a deodorant and a large pair of scissors. I crept in my own house and did not see Colby anywhere. I saw the letter tiles still on the floor and approached to read a terrifying message that pierced my heart and challenged my sanity:

'Kill you two soon. Inferiors' That was it, the dog had to go.

After dropping Danny at school thus ensuring his security, I phoned Trent, a friend working at an animal shelter to help me remove Colby from my house for good. Trent came alone, despite everything I told him about the animal and assured me that I could go to work in peace. Before I left, he promised to call later to ensure that the job was done and to tell me where he left the spare key upon leaving. He instead only sent me a text message.

Later during the evening, I picked up my son from my cousin's house and we headed home, our feelings about Colby conflicting since Danny kept referring to him as his dad. I tried to prepare the correct words for when I would tell him about Colby. Upon arriving at home, I noticed that Trent's truck was still parked near the yard, but the house was plunged in darkness. I phoned him but did not get any response.

"Stay in the car Danny." I quietly spoke.

The more I approached, the more I trembled, until I opened the door to an impending doom.

"Trent?" I called, not receiving any response.

I made my way into the house and quickly noticed that the electricity was cut. I tried calling Trent again, and gasped when I heard a loud ringtone resound from the bathroom. I followed the sound, but soon found myself following a trail of blood leading to the bathroom door. Before I opened the door, it seemed like every sound just disappeared except the ones made by my heartbeat. I pressed the handle and slowly pushed, enough to reveal Trent's head and a few other limbs lying on the floor. I dropped my phone and keys, screamed, and turned around to flee, only to see Colby staring at me with a human hand that had missing fingers in his mouth. He looked different, altered, and bloodthirsty. As a clear statement about his clear intentions, he then crushed the hand with his jaws before he began walking towards me. I could not stop screaming while running to my room. Colby kept on walking, confident in his chase. I rushed to the window but could not open it for some reason. I fetched a chair to attempt breaking the window glass and saw Colby walk in with my keys in the mouth. He was right, I needed them to escape with my son still in the car. Colby just dropped the keys in front of him and sat, daring me to approach and retrieve them.

"Easy Colby, easy. Good boy." I said with my trembling voice, tears escaping from my eyes. The dog stared at me silently before I continued. "There's no bad dog right? You a good, good dog, just like all the others."

He growled and stood up, angered by my last words, and before I could say anything, he attacked. Lunging at me with an unusual speed, he broke through the chair I was still holding and lodged his teeth in my right shoulder. The breaking bones and the excruciating pain made me think that my arm was about to come off. He then suddenly released me and growled at something at the door, and suddenly, a soldier walked in and shot the dog with some kind of darts. Some of them hit him, but Colby managed to knock him down and escape. The soldier then helped me get up and we tried to exit the house. He talked in some military coded language through his radio, while I kept on asking him to protect my son. I saw that there were many more soldiers in the house trying to neutralize the beast, and I noticed that all of them called the dog Archie or 0861. Colby ended up cornered in a store room as a dozen soldiers waited for him in front of the door. His growls became unnatural and monstrous until he became silent for a few seconds. In the silence of that moment, the closer soldier made one step forward when Colby suddenly burst through the wall in its new form and increased size. That was no dog. The thing I caught a glimpse of was a monster. Soon, I witnessed soldiers being beheaded and torn apart, while I was still helped to make an escape, until something behind me exploded, and everything went dark.

As if waking up from a horrible nightmare, I panicked on my hospital bed, demanding to see my son. Several men dressed in black and the medical staff calmed me down. They reassured me that Danny was safe and unarmed, but they really showed more concern about me avoiding to disclose any information about what happened. Archie, as they refer to the dog, succeeded to escape and it was safer for Danny and I not to return in that house or even the town.

For years I could not understand what really happened until I read a post on this very sub about six days ago. This story is a direct response to another post from last week Sunday that you can find right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12osmle/there_is_a_sly_and_deadly_invention_on_the_loose/), written by a scientist named Soraya. Just like her, I had to blow the whistle about something dangerous, hiding in plain sight. I take a huge risk doing this, and I have a son. Moreover, after lying to them for so many years, I believe that Trent's relatives and friends deserve to know the truth about his disappearance. Pardon me for not even revealing it to you in person.

I am sorry for the dog lovers convinced that there is no bad dog, it maybe true but please, remember that Archie is no ordinary animal. If there are only bad owners then maybe his evil nature is a result of his past. After all, it is not clearly detailed in Soraya's post. Therefore, if you think that just a little love and petting can change that monster for the better, well, I encourage you to try if you encounter it. Danny and I already tried. I just hope for you that it works, before Archie decides for whatever reason to rip you apart.
