Even though I should still stay off my feet, I went with August to a convention. Lucas had recently gotten into trading cards, and we couldn’t pass up taking him to an event where he could look at expensive ones. I didn’t know anything about this sort of thing, so Lucas was our guide for the day. We went on a Sunday to avoid the larger crowds and to take advantage of any sales.  

We did a round of the convention hall looking at all the tables. Lucas held my hand on one side and held onto August on the other. Good thing Lucas had short legs so I could keep up with him. After the first tour August asked if I could babysit for a while so he could start buying gifts.   

I lifted the boy in my arms and asked what he wanted to look at. We settled on a table with cases filled with cards. Some of the prices seemed a bit much for a simple piece of paper. I pointed to parts of the cases, asking Lucas about the displays.   

“How come some are in cases with numbers on top?” I asked him.  

“Those are graded cards.” Luas said his little arms wrapped around my neck.  

His was soft voice and he appeared a little nervous. He was enjoying himself but being around so many people still stressed him out a little.   

“Oh, so the number is the grade. So, a ten would be worth more than the eight, right?”   

He nodded then thought for a moment. His little finger pointed to two different cards, both graded as the same number.   

“That one is worth more than that one.” He commented.  

“Because it’s a rarer card, right?”   

He nodded again and I was proud I started to understand some of this stuff so quickly. I asked Lucas to tell me which cards re his favorite and which characters he liked. At first, I didn’t know the difference between Pokemon cards and Magic cards. He started to explain all the different types of trading cards out there too.   

While we spoke, I heard a voice I knew beside us. Lucas had been hiding my face on the side where the person stood. I glanced over watching the exchange. The newcomer picked out two cards and asked about the price of a third.  

“Is that a base set Charizard?” He asked and pointed to an ungraded card off to the side.  

It didn’t look as fancy as the others. I assumed it wouldn’t cost much.   

“Yes, it’s four hundred plus tax. No tax if you pay cash.” The vendor explained.  

I stood stunned at the amount. Really? That much for a single card? And one that wasn’t even fully illustrated? He nodded and decided to only get the two even though I could tell he really, really wanted the expensive one. He paid and took a few steps away when I whispered to Lucas.  

“That’s a friend from work. Let’s get him a present.”   

In the next two minutes, I had bought the Charizard, flinching a little at the total now on my credit card. Then I painfully picked up my pace to catch up while calling out his name.  

“Jacob!”  

He spun on his heels, a mixture of horror and then disgust on his face. He was going to make a run for it but he stopped for me to catch up. Jacob nodded towards Lucas at least being friendly to him.   

“Is he yours?” He asked.  

My heart nearly stopped. I didn’t even realize people might assume I was a father by carrying Lucas around like this.  

“No, August is taking care of him.”  

A mixture of emotions came over his face. No matter how he felt, he kept his mouth shut.   

“This is for you.” Lucas held out the small paper bag holding something worth a third of my rent.  

Jacob was confused by the gift. He accepted it with a wave of shock coming over him when he saw what was inside. His mouth fell open unable to say anything. His hand moved as if he wanted to return the gift. His name from behind interrupted his train of thought.  

A younger woman pushing a wheelchair with a bright smile stopped behind him. The middle-aged woman in the chair sat silently, hands folded in her lap. She wore an eyepatch hiding an older scar. She didn’t react when Jacob leaned down to talk with her.  

“Hey Mom, I got you these. And a co-worker lent me some money for this cool Charizard.” He said showing off the gifts.   

A glimmer came to her eye. His hand moved slowly to carefully touch the cards, then she rested her head against his cheek. She appeared tired. The helper noticed and offered to take his mother to a quieter place. Jacob said he would catch up in a minute. Something at the back of my mind bothered me. It felt like I was invading their privacy but I looked closer at Jacob’s mother trying to see any hints of something off about her.   

A small needle made of pure magic was embedded behind her eyepatch. My heart sank at the sight and I quickly glanced away.  

Lucas waved goodbye to the pair and suddenly I felt him being lifted from my arms. August took him back and gave Lucas a dirty look. Thankfully they didn’t get into it and they left to look at a pile of stuffed toys leaving me and Jacob alone.  

“I’ll pay you back.” Jacob said.  

“It’s fine. I don’t mind.” I shrugged.  

Contract workers get paid very well compared to other careers. I was always broke due to my medical debt. If you had some talent and didn’t spend money on weapons then it’s possible to make a million or two within a year of doing this job. Most people after the money ended up dead before they could spend it though.  

“I heard you’re poor. I’ll pay you back.” He insisted.   

Who told him that? I looked down at my clothing worried people could tell they were thrifted. He crossed his arms to lean against a pillar. We watched the helper carefully weave his mother through the crowd.  

“Thank you for that. My mother has loved Pokemon since it came out when she was nine. That card was one she always wanted but her medical care is... a lot. Gina is a lifesaver and worth every cent. Sometimes the money just isn’t there and I want to do more.”  

I did some quick math in my head. Jacob looked around nineteen. His mother may have had him around eighteen. Since he paid for her medical care, there wasn’t a father in sight. My mother also had me at a younger age. I knew a little bit of what he was going through because I was in a similar situation.   

“Can I ask something personal?” I asked him.  

He narrowed his eyes but let me go on.  

“The person who hurt her... Was it an insect-type creature?” I kept my voice low even though no one in the crowded hall would care what we were talking about.  

His face went slack then his cheeks slightly turned red. I had brought up a very sore spot. To his credit, he kept rather calm.  

“How did you know about that?” He hissed looking like he wanted to punch my teeth in.  

“I can see magic better than most humans. She has a needle still stuck behind her eye. Some insect and parasite creatures will inject their victims with such things to control their actions or make them docile. Normal doctors won’t be able to see it or treat something like this. I can get you in contact with a doctor that can. But I don’t know what damage has already been done.  But after it’s removed, she may improve in small ways like getting her speech back.”  

A flood of emotions came over him. He hated supernatural creatures because of what they did to his mother. And yet, one may be able to help her.  

“How can I trust you? All of this might be a way to lure her into becoming a meal.” He said behind gritted teeth.  

I shrugged unsure of how I could prove there were some good creatures out there. I hated the idea of his mother suffering for longer because of his lack of trust but I understood his reasoning.   

“I’ll be through The Corporation. It’s up to you if you’re comfortable with this. I’ll just give you the information.”  

He kept his arms folded as he internally debated on what to do. August came back with Lucas in tow. He started to pester me for some money as he ignored the current mood.   

“There is a large Gengar we want but I’m out of cash.” He said gesturing towards the plushie stall.  

“Didn’t you bring along like three grand today?” I said with a raised eyebrow.  

“Yes, but I spent it.” He said without a hint of shame.   

He held his hand out expecting money. I pulled out my credit card but refused to give it to him. I would go over with them to buy whatever they wanted instead of trusting him with my pin number. Lucas said they didn’t really need the toy horrified over how much his father had already spent in such a short amount of time. I assured him I didn’t mind getting him and August a gift. From the looks of things, August was the one who wanted the toy the most. I needed to tell Jacob one last thing before I walked away.  

“No matter what you decide, you’ve done an amazing job to take care of her. Your mother is lucky to have you.”  

He rubbed his nose holding back a response. He didn’t like me and couldn’t accept supernatural creatures but I was making it really hard for him to not change his mind.  

August dragged me away and pointed out a plush larger than Lucas. The price hurt a little but seeing Lucas happy made it worth it. What’s the point of doing life-threatening jobs if I wasn’t going to spend the money on something other than a debt? The toy was massive. Somehow, I was the one who got stuck carrying it around the convention hall. After lunchtime, Lucas started to fade. He needed a nap and we were broke. August hauled all his bags and his adopted son in his arms. When Lucas passed out, we used a magic door out of sight to get back to his place.  

I planned to leave for the day. My ankle was killing me. I nearly made it out the front door when our cell phones rang. An emergency request came in for some assistance. We needed to decide fast to accept the job or not. Lucas was still asleep but August didn’t like leaving him alone.   

Evie answered the call. She entered the house at the same time we left. Her eyebrows raised at the pile of goodies August bought that day.  

The job was simple. A friendly creature was attacked at a hoarder's house they were in the middle of cleaning and sent out an urgent request to be saved. Recently, The Corporation hired Trash Collectors which I heard was slightly different than Scene Cleaners but the jobs did often overlap. Mostly weaker creatures and humans were hired. It should be a low-risk job. When the call came through there weren’t any free Agents, or it was possible a certain Office Supervisor didn’t want to waste an Agent’s time and just passed it over to Contract Workers.  

August easily kicked down the door wasting no time to see what we were dealing with. Half of the lower floor had been cleaned before the attack started. A broken canvas wagon lay on its side, torn apart by sharp claws. A scream came from upstairs causing us to push through the garbage trying to reach the victim in time. The place smelled foul and the narrow pathways made it hard to move. My heart beat hard as I feared we arrived too late. August kicked down another door and recoiled for a moment at the burst of air that smelled like rotting flesh. We entered the room and into a gruesome sight.  

A pale man dressed in all black held a smaller creature at knifepoint. The room had been cleaned and turned into a place of death. Three rotten bodies with their faces covered were stitched together at the other side of the room. The sight nearly made me gag. Countless papers with odd writing covered the walls. It looked like someone had tried writing a summoning spell using every single language he knew and even tried to recreate the common language creatures used.  

We couldn’t act while he still had a hostage. I stood frozen in place trying to plan out my next move. What was this guy up to? From the looks of things, he wanted to summon a creature from another world, but what? How did a Trash Collector even stumble into this mess? Was this house not cleared of threats beforehand?   

“Move and he dies.” The man said in a raspy voice.  

This man was serious. The issue was he planned on killing the creature no matter what we did. The Trash Collector looked like a human with large pointed ears and wild hair dressed in layers of worn-down clothing. Gritting my teeth, I kept looking around the room for any way to save the poor creature. He looked to be on the verge of tears.  

Suddenly he was thrown to the ground, the knife left a long cut across his small cheek causing droplets of blood to hit the floor. August moved but my ankle was useless to join him to help.  

Sharp claws appeared as August slightly transformed to take down the threat before he killed an innocent victim. As it turns out, we weren’t needed for that. The small Trash Collector screamed and pushed against his attacker's chest. He stuck a slip of paper on his attacker's black sweater and then curled into a ball with his hands over his head. The man wasn’t aware of what the paper did but he knew he needed to remove it.   

He didn’t get the charm away in time. The room shook and parts of the walls became painted with blood.  

Since August had been behind the attacker, he also got covered in gore. The Trash Collector had slapped a paper charm on the man’s chest causing the upper half of his body to become a liquid splattered across the room. I’ve only ever used paper charms on monsters. I never realized what kind of damage one could do to a human.  

August stood shocked over what happened. As he recovered, I went over to the small Cleaner bending down to his level. I offered him a tissue for the tears that started to form.  

“I... Killed...” He hiccupped unable to get the words out.   

I carefully put a hand on his shoulder trying not to startle him. It was perfectly reasonable to defend yourself. Exploding someone was pretty traumatizing through. I understood how upset this could be to someone who had never hurt a person before. We had all day so I was willing to take it slow to let him calm down.   

“Can I adopt him?” August asked, his hands raised as if he was holding back the urge to kidnap up the Cleaner. An odd grin was over his face under all the blood.  

“He’s an adult. Don’t be weird.” I berated him.   

Sure, this Cleaner was short but it’s not as if he looked like a child. I tried waving August away so he wouldn’t scare the person we came to rescue.   

My eyes were drawn towards some movement near the bodies on the other side of the room. Some blood landed near their feet and started to slowly run along the floor toward them.   

A crackle of power sparked through the room. I pushed the Cleaner behind me hoping we could get him out in time. Whatever this man wanted to summon failed, but he created a space where dark magic festered. Any manner of new creatures may be born of the tainted magic in the air, or it could open up a small opening to a different world for any kind of monster to get through. It seemed as if we had the bad luck to deal with both outcomes.  

The bodies snapped into place absorbing the tainted air. They merged them into an abomination. The sight of it made the Cleaner scream and cling to my arm. It looked like a centipede made up of fused rotten bodies. Each arm at its side to used to rapidly crawl across the floor. August snapped back into action; his claws ready to defend us.  

The newly born monster would fall apart once the magic source ran out. That may be in about an hour. We didn’t have time to worry about it as that creature soon did not become a priority. A small ball of dark blue sparks appeared at the far side of the room.   

“August! Something is trying to get through!” I shouted at him and gathered the small creature in my arms.  

This opening trying to form wasn’t like the one I encountered in the forest. It would close again when the creature pushing on the other side entered like Honey’s large spider sibling. Depending on the strength of the creature it wouldn’t be an end of the world scenario but I was certain we would be killed if it got through. We needed to cut off the connection before it was too late. The issue was I didn’t know what that opening was feeding off of to be created. There were small items littered across the floor, not to mention all the different pieces of paper all over the wall that could hold a spell.  

To make everything harder, the creature August started to fight and decided to split off. In a flash, the bottom half formed into another centipede and raced toward the weaker ones in the room.  

The Cleaner yelped and leaped from my arms. The poor thing ran on all fours around the room while being chased by the monster hot on his heels. I felt bad for him but I couldn’t run fast enough to catch up. Instead, I started to rip down the papers from the walls as they kept the monsters distracted.   

The Cleaner used some magic focused on his palms and feet to cling to the walls. He raced around staying ahead from getting ripped apart but that wouldn’t last for very long. In my panic I noticed something. His movements weren’t random. He was darting around the room and scratching a long curved line along the floor. My brain clued into what he was doing. He was making a circle.  

I got ready, muscles tense waiting for the right moment to act. The Cleaner could use the circle to create a simple spell, but he did not have enough magic to power it. That was where I came in. He connected the line and finished a circle that took up nearly the entire room. Then he stopped to press his hands into the line ready to pour power into it while giving the spell and order. The monster that had been chasing him slipped along the floor trying to correct itself to attack him.  

August had buried his claws in the other creature when I grabbed the back of his shirt and then placed a hand on the Cleaners shoulder. I then mentally pulled magic out of the creature August was still attached to, through him, through myself, and gave that power to the Cleaner so he had the strength he needed. The centipede creature was drained within seconds and fell to pieces. Normally this sort of thing wouldn’t work, but it had been made in such a sloppy way that stealing away power wasn’t an issue. This stunt hurt all of us much like an electrical current would but it was better than dying.  

The spell the Cleaner created was the same one that had been in the dumpster when I worked with Rory. All the papers, blood, junk, and even the remains of the bodies sank into the floor to be sent off to be burned. It was a spell that only affected non-living things inside the circle. We were safe but the other creature sank halfway into the floor. It wasn’t fully alive so it wasn’t fully affected. The Cleaner could not keep the spell going. He collapsed on the ground cutting off the connection. The centipede creature’s lower half was also cut off when the spell stopped.   

I had hoped we were in the clear. Whatever had been causing the opening to be created disappeared and the connection got cut off. We took care of the two monsters in the room but we weren’t fast enough.  

A burst of power knocked me off my feet. I recovered quickly, my hands still burning from pushing magic around.  

August stayed on his feet, ready to attack as we took in the new creature that found its way into our world. The opening closed so nothing else would appear. We just needed to deal with one more problem. At least I had a person with good fighting skills on my side.   

The figure on the other side of the room was tall pale and thin. The body was covered by some sort of hard plating. The face looked similar to a cicada mixed with a human. In fact, it looked to be a perfect mix of a human girl and an insect.   

“Can you hold it off while we-” I started as I snapped my head toward August.  

He was stock still, a serious expression on his face. The thing made an odd ringing noise and his body fell limp. An odd distance look came over him and he took a weak step away from me.   

Oh god damn it.   

They weren’t the same species but that didn’t stop him from becoming brainwashed by a hot female cicada right in front of him. I bet she smelled him from that opening and pushed her way through trying to reach an available mate. I didn’t know what she would do with me and the Cleaner, but I would like to bet we would become meals for her future eggs if she got ahold of August.  

I picked up the weak Cleaner and shoved him against August’s chest even though he still appeared transfixed.  

“Lucas is hurt. You need to get him to a doctor.” I told him trying to block his sight of the other insect.  

Something flickered in his eyes. He reached up to take hold of the smaller person and shook his head. He wasn’t fully back to his senses but he knew he needed to get out of that room.  

He made it to the door when the female creature realized he had sort of broken through her spell. In a blur, she crossed the distance but I put myself between them. Long sharp teeth sank into my shoulder and claws were about to rip apart my chest. For some reason she pulled back, spitting out my blood as if I tasted horrible.  

Fine by me, that bought enough time. August and The Cleaner had safely left the room. My foot was on top of the circle and I grabbed a hold of her wrist ready to do something that would hurt. A lot.  

My plan was to use the circle to send her away. But I didn’t pull enough power and the pain kept me from being focused enough. Instead, the entire floor exploded downward, taking us crashing to the first floor. I landed hard, the wind knocked from my lungs.  

My head spun and I should have died. How many times had I expected death that didn’t come? No teeth and claws came down. The monster that should have fed on my flesh stood up from the debris and then got her head neatly sliced from her body. It was over before I even opened my eyes again.  

A voice I knew said something as I was hauled back to my feet. I found myself supported by a cool body.  

“Ito?” I asked confused as to why he was there.  

“Why did you take a job before you were fully healed?! Take better care of your body!” He snapped when he pulled away.  

I looked him over to see scratches all over her porcelain face and his arm missing. Again. He must have just finished a job and rushed over.  

“Kettle calling the pot and all that...” I replied and got a deserved punch to the arm.  

“I can replace parts! You can’t!” He huffed.  

Well, I did get my leg replaced and it was the main cause of my debt. Something like that wasn’t cheap but I didn’t feel like getting into all that with him.   

“Is August and the other person ok?” I asked and looked around the room.  

I spotted them near the doorway shocked over how I crashed through the floor and lived. The Cleaner spotted his ruined wagon nearby. The entire day finally overwhelmed him. He broke down crying because it was his main source of income. August couldn’t help himself from acting like a concerned parent and assuring he would make sure the poor guy got a new wagon.   

My entire body hurt and I needed to rest against Ito to remain upright. Then, two more people entered the house. They were not the pair I ever thought I would see together let alone in a place like this.  

Klaus gave us a friendly wave as a shorter person stayed by his side, arms behind his back studying the scene.   

I’ve only met Lupa once or twice before and it was quick. I hadn’t heard good things about him. He was an Office Supervisor. They dealt with a lot, but their main duty was to assign Agents or Contract Workers to jobs. In a way, they held the lives of the ones who worked for them in their hands.   

Lupa was short with soft brown hair. Most of his height appeared to be two large rabbit ears. He wore a brown vest and pressed pants that were cut off at the knees so his animal legs could move freely. He appeared to be a cute nearly middle age rabbit man but that image quickly wore off once it became clear how ruthless he could be.  

From what I’ve heard he believed weaker creatures were nothing but a resource to be used. That the weak needed to become prey for the world to keep moving.  

At least that kind of outlook didn’t rub off on Klaus. These two are heavy hitters so why were they here? Klaus held one of the papers that had been inside the room that the Cleaner sent through. I squinted at it trying to read what it said. The word was written in the common language of creatures but I figured it out in a few seconds.  

Unfair Exchange? No, it meant something closer to greed.  

“Ito, can you get Richmond treated in the office and then take him home?” Klaus asked but his smile appeared strained.  

“Agent Ito.” Lupa corrected.  

I doubted he liked how formally Klaus acted around us.   

“Sorry. Pretty please my little sweet Agent Ito?”  

A swift kick came from Lupa to the back of Klaus’ leg as his face remained collected. Lupa swiftly turned to head upstairs to get a better look at the house in case we missed anything.  

“What are you two doing here? Is something going on?” I asked and Ito’s face fell.  

Agents normally don’t question the higher-ups. They understood some stuff needed to be kept a secret. Klaus shrugged brushing off my comment.  

“Not really. But I think Lupa is after a promotion to become the head Office Supervisor so he wants something to be going on. Go along now. We’ll clean this up.”  

I nodded and let him leave. August was well enough to get the person we saved back home and that left Ito to drag me towards a door so he could use a key that took us back to the office. I hated going in for medical treatments.   

Cases like these were paid by the person who asked for help. There was no way I would ever demand payment from that little Cleaner. So, these treatments were going to be put on my credit card. Today turned out to be an expensive one.  

“How about we skip the office, head to a hotel, and fool around?” I offered Ito.  

He raised an eyebrow and only needed to press a finger into my injured shoulder to make his point clear. Since his treatments were different, I was abandoned in the office clinic to get cleaned up. He came back to make sure I got home safe and made veiled threats if I went against my bed rest.  I promised him I would let myself heal fully knowing if a well-paying job came up, I would break that promise.  

After all, bed rest doesn’t pay my bills or keep me fed.
