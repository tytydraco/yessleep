Saturday while I was out prepping for a job I was doing Sunday I get a call from my "wife" (we been together for 11 years)
I get a call from her that she stabbed her foot by accident and was bleeding a lot. I rush back to give her aid and check wound. It wasn't bad just a minor puncture on the top. I cleaned the wound and bandaged it proper. The lost blood was not insignificant but not detrimental at the same time or I would have took her to the er. 

She called her sister who lives about 20 minutes away to bring her some food. Her sister brought her some soup and garlic bread. She ate and I guess left the garlic bread wrapped up in aluminum foil. 

I was relaxing since I nearly had a heartattack trying to get back to her earlier for something she could have handled. 

We had a approx 9 year old American shihtzu. He was very built for his breed. Toned and we kept his hair short since we live in Florida. When we got him he was a street dog and the vet said he was about 5 years old. That was 4 years ago. 


I was even allergic somewhat to dogs at the beginning and had to take benadryl just to function for the first month.

We feed him the best food, she would always buy him Toys and his toy chest was overflowing and he always played with them. I would walk him at least every morning and most evenings. 

He was a happy dog living a pampered life.

My "wife" had to undergo cancer treatment back in 2017/2018. She has been in remission but takes a variety of prescriptions and otc medications to function. 

I got up from the computer desk in my home office. I found a aluminum foil torn to shreds on the couch and crumbs. Only one person could have done that and that was our dog. 

I started calling vets looking online to see if it was okay. I was getting conflicted information. So I called an emergency vet. He started to stumble while I was on the phone, and was running around licking my feet. 

My wife and I got into an argument. I wanted to take him to the er and she didn't want me to, because we are strapped for money. 

She slammed the bedroom door and yelled at me if I don't leave she will call the pigs. I left to the local home depot. I called her several times and when I got her to answer she said he was just resting and looking better. I continued on my store visit and was about to check out when she called me frantic that he was going. 

I flew back home again for the second time in one day and broke down the trim because she locked the chain on the door after I left. 

I could tell he was gone. And I was furious. I eventually calmed down and started to dig a hole in the backyard. Mind you it's about 9 almost 10pm. I'm crying and shoveling. I came in to check on her and help her a bit she said she wanted a viking funeral for him. 

I placed his bed and as many of the toys I could find in the hole and poured gas and motor oil on the before staying his toys on it. She wrapped him in his favorite blanket and he had the odor when I came in. She walked him outside and placed him, and I lit the fire. She went inside and I stayed there to make sure no bugs could get to him. 

Of course his belongings would have gone up before he did so I had to rearrange my dead dog who was half burnt in rigormortis.

I only came in to go into my safe to grab a gentleman jack bottle I keep in there to calm my nerves. 

He turned to ash as I stayed there for hours chain smoking cigarettes crying and pissed in a emotional roller-coaster. 

I didn't sleep that night and had to get my crew to work that morning. I was a wreck and couldn't do much. We finished the job Tuesday a day over schedule because of me. I didn't make shit on the job. 

On Sunday I get a notification from my bank about mobile gaming charges. I called her and asked her if she did it and she denied it. She had done this before where she takes my card and charges stupid gaming fees to my card. 

Thursday night we had a bad storm and our two cats were hiding. One of them that likes to ride my shoulder was under the bed. I noticed some garbage and told her to clean it. 

I left to the office room for a minute and came back to fund her saying out loud she had found some unisom style sleep aids that she uses under the bed. And some of them had been chewed on. 

I looked it up and it all makes sense. I was furious and after an hour of holding it in I couldn't anymore. 

I told her she was a fat slob and it wasn't the garlic bread but her pills she obviously left out that killed our dog.
