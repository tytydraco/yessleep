*A heaped crumpled mess*

*she lays halfway down the stairs*

*I hold her wrinkly broken head in me/*

*my hands, a half in each hand*

*a broken pomegranate*

*her brains sweet seeds I*

*suckle, sucked on to grow*

*my silk is red, the feet of the birds on*

*my shoulders bloom with blood*

*warm against me she smiles*

*I see her in the dark*

*She brushes the strands of black*

*off my face with sticky fingers*

*I beg her…*

 

Her fingers pause on the keyboard.

 

*I beg her, I beg her, I beg her* what*?*

 

*I beg her to never leave.*

*I beg her stay.*

*I beg her to live.*

 

*A grandmother is mortally wounded at the base of the stairs and a little girl, wrapped up in her nan’s nightgown, is holding her. What does the little girl say to her nan?*

 

*Ugh.* Frustration. Her nostrils flared.

 

Lucille slammed the laptop shut, annoyed and worried about the poem. It wasn’t for anybody else’s eyes, but hers, but she wanted something that was emotion provoking. This made her feel nothing. Speaking to nobody in particular, she leant back in her chair and stretched, feeling the bones in her back crack. *Release.*

 

“I want pomegranate juice.”  She sighed and flexed her shoulders.

 

“There’s some hearty pomme shit in the fridge.”  Tony replied. He didn’t look up from his computer. His headphones were tangled in with the messy mop of his hair, but he left one ear exposed, just for her. She reached over and brushed some hair off his face.

 

“You writing or listening?” She asked. 

 

“Composing.” He replied.

 

Tony was a musician. Well, no, he was a banker. Most days his hair was brushed and gelled back, and he’d wear a stiff blue suit, one of five in his closet. Monday to Friday he looked like Patrick bloody Bateman. On nights and weekends, especially after a smoke and a shower, he unwound into the tangled creature before her. Everything about him, after he brought home a paycheck, screamed music and rhythm; something untidy, something curly and organic –just like his hair. He had dark features and a constant smirk on his face. And his hips, they’d often sway, and he’d hop from foot to foot, nodding his head subtly. There was always the thudding base of a song echoing into his ears from his phone, or in other cases, the low hum of him singing to himself.

 

Lucille and Tony were fucking. Lucille loved him dearly, but it was just sex, and she knew at the bottom of her heart that Tony already was sitting with the love of his life, typing up those lyrics on his screen.

 

She got up and went to her kitchen. It was three steps from her bed. The studio she lived in was tiny and overstuffed. Lucille had an addiction problem; clothes stuffed every corner of her room as well as the bits and pieces of the hundred hobbies she picked up and dropped just as quickly as she started them. A half constructed off brand Lego Eiffel tower sat on the matchbook table that made her dining room. There was a ukelele and guitar (and violin) on top of the kitchen cabinets. A barely used bike hung off a rack on one wall. A hundred knick-knacks from various travels, from random pebbles to bottle openers, keychains, and fridge magnets, perched in their resting places on the dozen shelves Lucille put up – shelves that, unfortunately for her, made the place feel even more cramped and unliveable. But it wasn’t unlovable, her home. It was just too busy for her own good.

 

She opened her fridge and drained the large bottle of *what a rip off* expensive pomegranate juice from her fridge. Unlike Tony, she was giving a go of writing at the sacrifice of living comfortably.

 

*If you call what Tony does living.* Lucille thought.

 

Lucille wanted to experience everything before she started working 9-5. Her home was much a reflection of herself, messy, filled with too many things, too many dreams and memories. She figured she could go and get a real job in her thirties. Besides, what else was being young for? And if Tony’s soul mate was music making, why the hell make it part time?

 

She ballerina-ed back to the bed and sunk in next to Tony. Laptop to laptop, *how sweet*. Lucille decided to check her emails before going back to the poem that was stabbing at her creative side. A single email sat in her inbox.

 

**Subject: RESPOND ASAP LUCILLE DURRY**

 

*Weird. It doesn’t show who sent it.*

 

She narrowed her eyes and clicked, curious.



*My Miss Durry,*

*There is a beautiful star in the sky that I want to give you. Most nights, she’s as pitch black as the world around her and sleeps a lot. But I get to hunt her when she wakes up. She opens her single eye and the shimmering gold that comes from that damned giant iris gets me a few steps closer. Durry, you should feel what it’s like being in her light.  I don’t know how long it’ll take me to get to this star, but eventually, somehow, sometime, I’ll pluck her from the sky and wrap her up in some butcher’s paper just for you.*

*Merry Christmas*

*Love Teary*

 

“But it’s not even Christmas.” Lucille murmured, perplexed by the email.

 

*What the fuck.*

 

Another email dinged into her inbox. Same thing, no sender.

 

**Subject: TEARY LOOKING FOR HIS DURRY**

*Dearest Miss Durry,*

*There is a dog on street corner that I want to give to you. He’s as brown as a healthy poo and smiles like a person with human teeth, molars and all. I want to give him to you. He only seems comes out to say hello the morning after I’ve had a bad dream. Honestly, I’m not sure if he’s real. I haven’t had any dreams lately –good or bad— so it’s been awhile since he’s appeared. I tend stop dreaming when you’re not around, I’m not even sure if I’m real without you honestly. I miss you Durry, so either way, when you’re home, I’ll make sure we’ll have a real dog’s breakfast. Together.*

*Happy Holidays*

*Mr. Teary*
