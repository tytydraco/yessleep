Hey, I'm back. I went to see Levi again this Saturday. No matter how many deliveries I made this week, no matter how many terrifying things I witnessed or impossible challenges I faced, Saturday afternoon from two to six belonged to him. It's our unwritten rule.



The company provides room and board, and I provide the social interaction, and the closest thing to parental care you can get when your ward is a shapeshifter who sometimes forgets what species he's supposed to be.



Today's destination is Riverside Park. Levi had been talking about going there all week, to see real squirrels, not the mutated squirrels that live on the fringes of society, or the kind of telepathic squirrels I once delivered handmade nuts to at the Pemberton Building.



"Normal squirrels," he said, his eyes sparkling with excitement, "the kind that just run around eating acorns and don't try to sell you prophecies."



"That was only once," I retorted. "And I didn't buy the prophecy."



"You gave him a twenty-dollar bill."



"He was persistent."



Now we're sitting on a park bench, Biscuit lying at our feet, looking like a perfectly normal uncle and nephew enjoying a spring afternoon. They can't see the faint glow around Levi, or how his shadow occasionally moves independently, or how he tracks the squirrels with predatory precision.



"I'm doing really well, right?" Levi said, his eyes fixed on a particularly plump squirrel. "I haven't even thought about chasing them."



"You're doing great."



"I haven't even thought about what they taste like."



"Levi."



"What? I didn't think so! I'm just acknowledging that I didn't think so. That's progress." He finally looked at me, grinning. "Can we get ice cream? You promised."



I did promise him ice cream. It's a routine we've established over the past six months: going to the park, watching squirrels, eating ice cream, then going home for pizza and watching a movie of Levi's choosing. “There’s an ice cream truck over there,” I said, pointing to a white van decorated with colorful patterns and playing cheerful music. “Want to go?”



“Can I go by myself? Like a big kid?” Levi jumped up, bouncing excitedly. “I promise I won’t transform. I won’t even talk to any strange people. I’ll just buy the ice cream, pay, say thank you, and come right back.”



I hesitated. The park was safe, at least as safe as anywhere in this city, despite the hidden layers of the city that most people couldn't see. And Levi needed independence. He needed to be trusted.



“Okay. But you have to stay where I can see you. If anything feels wrong—”



“Run first, ask questions later, I know.” He was already walking towards the ice cream truck, his gait now almost entirely human, only a slight bounce betraying his non-human nature.



I watched him go, Biscuit's head resting on my knee. The little booklet was still in my jacket pocket, never far from me. I'd carried it every day for two and a half years, until the leather cover was worn into the shape of my chest. Some pages I had memorized. Some pages revealed new content every time I looked at them, entries seemingly appearing as needed, rules manifesting just when I was about to need them.



The afternoon sun was warm and pleasant. A family was playing on the grass. A couple was throwing a frisbee. An old man was feeding pigeons. Everything was normal. Peaceful. Days like this sometimes made me forget that I had been working in this abnormal place for two and a half years.



Then, the booklet started to burn.



Not metaphorically, but literally burning. I snatched it out of my pocket and threw it onto the bench, smoke rising from the pages. Biscuit jumped up, growling warily. The booklet was open to a page that hadn't existed thirty seconds ago. The paper was crisp, the ink still wet, and there was only one word, written in a hurried, scrawling hand:



RUN!



I snapped my head up. Levi was by the ice cream truck, pointing at the different flavors, a smile on his face. Everything looked perfectly normal. Except...



Except now another ice cream truck appeared. It drove in from the other side of the park, a road that definitely hadn't been there before. A white van, brightly decorated, playing the same cheerful music from its speakers. In fact, the music from both trucks was perfectly synchronized.



Just as I watched, a third ice cream truck materialized out of thin air at the north entrance of the park.



"Oh no."



I grabbed the smoking pamphlet—I watched as new words appeared on it: Three ice cream trucks mean hunting mode. They will surround you. Do not let them trap you. Do not accept ice cream under any circumstances.



I ran.



Biscuit ran ahead of me, already sprinting towards Levi, barking anxiously. I dashed across the park, leaping over a picnic blanket, nearly colliding with the couple playing frisbee, everyone staring at me.



"Levi!" I shouted. "Levi, run!"



He turned around, an ice cream cone in his hand. Chocolate chip flavor, a confused expression on his face. Then he saw my expression, saw Biscuit's frantic barking, and his survival instincts kicked in. The ice cream dropped from his hand, and he sprinted towards me.



The trucks moved.



Not driving. Sliding. They defied the laws of physics, the rules of the road, and the basic principles of how vehicles should move. They slid across the grass, hopped over curbs, moving with a predatory coordination. Their music grew louder, more jarring, weaving together into a melody that made my teeth ache.



"What's going on?!" Levi shouted as we met in the middle of the park.



"No time! Run!"



We ran. The trucks pursued us. The people in the park were now also noticing the trucks, not because anything was wrong, but because the ice cream trucks were offering specials, deals, and free samples. I saw families standing up, children pulling at their parents' hands, all drawn like moths to a flame by the cheerful vehicles. “Don’t listen to them!” I shouted, but my voice was drowned out by the music.



A truck blocked our path from the east. Another approached from the south. A third was driving us towards the center of the park, towards a gazebo I’d never noticed before, a gazebo that certainly hadn’t been there when we arrived.



“Eric!” Levi’s voice was panicked. “I can’t hold on! I’m going to transform!”



“Then transform! Whatever it takes to keep you alive!”



His human body suddenly swelled. His legs lengthened, his knees bending backward, becoming digitigrade, suitable for running. Claws grew on his hands. His face protruded forward, becoming something between a man and a wolf, with sharp, numerous teeth. And from his back, something I’d never seen before, eight thick, muscular appendages sprouted, black and glistening.



Tentacles. Octopus tentacles, each as thick as my arm, covered in suction cups that opened and closed like hungry mouths. “I didn’t know I could do this!” Levi shouted, his voice distorted by the changes in his throat. “I didn’t know I had this power inside!”



The first ice cream truck lunged at us, not driving now, but pouncing, its wheels off the ground, attacking like a wild beast. Levi’s tentacles shot out, wrapping around the truck’s front bumper. Metal twisted and deformed. The truck’s cheerful surface cracked open, and I saw what was inside. Teeth. So many teeth. Spiraling like a lamprey’s mouth.



Levi threw the truck away. It flew thirty feet, crashed into a tree, and exploded into pink and white smoke that smelled like cotton candy and formaldehyde.



“Awesome!” Levi screamed, adrenaline and fear making him manic. “I’m so powerful!”



“Two more!” I shouted. “Stay focused!”



The second truck was smarter. It split open in the middle, unfolding like a flower, revealing an interior filled with eyes and the same spiraling teeth. A long, grasping tongue, dripping with some kind of liquid, hissed as it extended towards us across the grass.



Levi's tentacles intercepted it, wrapping around the tongue, and a tug-of-war ensued. The truck shrieked, a sound like a mixture of grinding gears and human vocal cords.



"Eric! The pamphlet，What do we do?!"



I fumbled for the pamphlet, flipping through the pages that were being rewritten in real-time. I found the relevant entry: Ice Cream Trucks (Hostile). They hunt in packs. They feed on wonder and innocence, especially the moment a child realizes that magic is real and dangerous. If three trucks surround a target simultaneously, the target is devoured and becomes part of the convoy. Known weaknesses: salt circles, iron filings, or simultaneously destroying all three trucks.



"We need to destroy all three trucks at once!" I shouted.



"How?!"



Good question. The third truck was now circling us, looking for an opportunity. Two of Levi's tentacles were wrapped around the second truck, and four more were writhing defensively in the air, his werewolf-hybrid body balanced on his reversed legs. He looked like something out of a nightmare.



Think, Eric. Think like a delivery man. Think like someone who survived two and a half years of impossible delivery missions. What do I have? What resources do I have?



My phone. My company phone.



I pulled out my phone and dialed the company number.



"Eric," the operator's voice was calm, even slightly amused. "Let me guess. Ice cream emergency?"



"Three trucks! They're hunting! Levi's mutated, he's grown tentacles, it's horrible, and—"



"Tentacles are a sign of evolution. That's good for him. Are the tentacles pink or black?"



"Black! What does that matter?!"



"Black means he's tapping into his deeper biological abilities. If they were pink, it would mean he was hallucinating. This is good." I heard the rustling of paper. “Those trucks. Are they in formation yet?”



“Almost,About thirty seconds!”



“Do you have anything made of iron on you? If not, there’s an iron plate embedded in the cover of the pamphlet. When the trucks are in formation, throw it at the middle truck. The iron will disrupt their formation. Then Levi can take them out one by one.”



“The pamphlet?! I need that pamphlet!”



“Eric. Trust me. Throw the pamphlet. It will come back. It always comes back.”



The third truck was moving into position, forming a triangle with Levi and me at the center. The gazebo I’d noticed earlier was now behind us, and I realized it wasn’t a gazebo, it was a throat. The whole thing was a giant mouth, the teeth disguised as decorative trim, waiting to swallow us when the trucks pushed us back.



“Levi， Hold on for five more seconds!”



His tentacles were now wrapped around two of the trucks, gripping them with sheer force. His wolf-like face was contorted with effort, saliva dripping from his fangs.



The trucks were in formation. A perfect triangle. A clanging sound synchronized into a single note, not a sound, but a pressure, reality warping around us, the air thick with the smell of carnival popcorn and blood.



I threw the pamphlet.



It spun through the air, pages fluttering, and struck the center of the gazebo-like mouth. A blue flash, a smell of ozone, and they shattered into pieces, evaporating before they hit the ground.



The formation was broken. The trucks screamed in unison.



“Now, Levi!” He didn’t need to be told twice. Six tentacles grabbed the first truck, lifting it off the ground, then slamming it into the second. The impact was tremendous. Both vehicles twisted and deformed, the ice cream truck shells peeling away to reveal writhing flesh and metal wreckage beneath.



The third truck tried to escape, but Levi’s remaining two tentacles shot out, impossibly long, and wrapped around its axles. He yanked it back, pulling it into the pile of wreckage from the other two trucks.



Then he squeezed.



All eight tentacles contracted simultaneously. The metal shrieked. Flesh and blood burst. The three trucks were compressed into a twisted ball of matter, getting smaller and smaller until—



Bang.



They vanished. Completely gone. Leaving only scorched marks on the grass and the lingering smell of burnt sugar.



Levi collapsed to the ground, his body rippling, his tentacles retracting into his back, his legs transforming back into human form, and his face returning to that of an eleven-year-old boy. He lay on the grass, panting and covered in sweat.



I ran to his side. "Are you okay? Are you hurt?"



"That was..." he gasped, "...the coolest thing... I've everdone that."



I couldn't help but laugh. Hysterical, relieved laughter that made my ribs ache. Biscuit licked both our faces, his tail wagging furiously, celebrating our survival.



The pamphlet appeared in my hand. It simply materialized out of thin air, warm and intact, as if it had never left.



The people in the park started moving again, as if someone had pressed the play button on a paused video. But none of them seemed to remember the trucks or the fight. They simply went back to their picnics and frisbee games, reality automatically correcting itself to maintain normalcy.



"Can we still get ice cream?" Levi asked weakly.



"Of course," I said. "Of course, we can get ice cream." We walked to a grape-flavored ice cream shop, Levi holding my hand with one hand and stroking Biscuit with the other. He was completely back in human form, but I noticed that his shadow had several extra tentacles, while his body didn't. The tentacles were still there, just invisible, lurking beneath the surface.



The shop owner served us himself, an elderly Italian man who glanced at us and said, "Ah. Another ice cream truck? They show up every few years. Always causing trouble." He scooped us two generous portions. “It’s free. You did a great job chasing them away. The children will thank you, even if they don’t know it themselves.”



“How do you know?” I asked.



He tapped his temple with his finger. “I can see things. I’ve been able to see things for many years. That’s why my ice cream is safe. I know what the other ice cream trucks are. I make sure my ice cream is just ice cream.” He smiled.



We sat outside, eating ice cream in the afternoon sun. Levi ordered chocolate chip again. I got vanilla, because I’m boring like that. Biscuit also got a small cup of dog-friendly vanilla ice cream, because Giuseppe had specially prepared some for good dogs who save the world.



“Eric?” Levi said, his mouth full of ice cream.



“Hmm?”



“Thank you for not being scared. About those tentacles. Some people would definitely be scared.”



“Levi, I once delivered food to a thirteenth floor that didn't even exist. I rode a horse to a castle with a well in it, and the well contained something ancient. I watched you eat pizza for the first time, and you even forgot to use your hands.” I took a bite of my ice cream. “So, in my opinion, tentacles are cool.”



He grinned. “Really?”



“Really. But maybe practice a few more times. Before you use them again. So you don't accidentally grab a real ice cream truck.”



“That would be bad.”



“That would be very bad.” We finished our ice cream, walked home in the sunset, and then ordered pizza. That night, Levi fell asleep on the couch halfway through a movie, and when Marcus came to pick him up, I carried him back to the car he was getting heavier and heavier; one of my colleagues explained that shapeshifters gain weight rapidly as they mature. In another year or two, I wouldn't be able to carry him anymore.



—



Bipolar disorder is a liar. My therapist, or maybe just myself, always says that. It deceives you when you're manic, telling you that you don't need sleep, you don't need medication, you don't need help, because you've finally seen everything clearly, finally unlocked your true potential. It also deceives you when you're depressed, telling you that everything is meaningless, nothing will ever get better, and the weight on your chest will never disappear.



Tonight, it was deceiving me in the first way. The clarity brought on by mania, but it wasn't true clarity, but rather an electric tingling sensation coursing through my veins, making me unable to sit still, making my thoughts race faster than I could process them, making me feel like the walls of the apartment were closing in on me.



I had already taken my medication. But it hadn't kicked in yet. Maybe another hour, or two. So I paced back and forth. I brewed coffee, but I didn't drink any of it.

The company phone rang.



I should ignore it, I should let it go to voicemail, or in this dimension of normal time and space... Any company that delivers physical goods would have a voicemail-like function. But the manic part of my brain saw an opportunity: movement, activity, a goal. Delivering could burn off this energy. Delivering could focus my attention on something else, instead of those chaotic thoughts.



I grabbed the phone.



Delivery address: 447 Ashwood Street, Apartment 12. Simple. Straightforward. The address was in an ordinary neighborhood, the kind of place I'd delivered to a hundred times.



The entry in the booklet was longer than usual, but I was so giddy with excitement that I barely read it carefully:



447 Ashwood Street is a special building. Reality is fragile there. Apartment 12 has three doors, sometimes a fourth appears out of nowhere, each marked with a cross. Only one is real. The others lead elsewhere. Choose correctly.



I should have read it more carefully. I should have looked at the extra warnings, the supplementary notes, and the previous delivery driver's comments. But I was in a manic state, acting impulsively, my brain a jumble of caffeine and neurochemicals, the words blurring before my eyes.



I drove to the address. The building was old, a Victorian-era structure converted into apartments, paint peeling, the porch crumbling. The kind of place where the rent is cheap because the landlord can't be bothered to maintain it properly. Normal. Ordinary. Safe. 



The delivery was chicken curry and garlic naan. It smelled delicious, and my stomach reminded me that I hadn't eaten dinner yet. When I have these episodes, I often forget to eat until I'm shaking from hunger.



I climbed to the second floor. The corridor was narrow, the wallpaper peeling in strips, and only a flickering light bulb provided barely adequate illumination. Apartment doors lined both sides of the corridor: 8, 9, 10, 11…



Then, there were three doors, all marked "Number 12." They were identical. The same peeling brown paint, the same brass door numbers, the same cheap locks. Each door had a cross painted on it, possibly with white paint, or something else. However, these crosses were slightly different, varying in style and proportion. One looked like a Catholic cross, symmetrical and regular. One looked like an Orthodox cross, with a slanted bar at the bottom. And another was older and cruder, like the kind of cross carved into a tree to ward off evil spirits.



The pamphlet said that only one door was real. The others led elsewhere.



I stared at the three doors, and in my manic state, I was convinced I could deduce the answer through logical reasoning. The Catholic cross was too obvious, so it was probably wrong. The Orthodox cross was the most complex, so maybe that was the right one? Or was this reverse psychology, and the simplest, crudest cross was the correct one because… Which one is the real one?



My thoughts raced, a chaotic mess, each conclusion contradicting the last. I couldn't focus. The medication hadn't kicked in yet, and my brain felt like it was short-circuiting.



I needed help.



I should call Marcus.



No, wait. This was just a simple delivery. Calling for backup... that would make me look weak. I've been doing this for two and a half years. I can handle three doors.



But which door to choose?



I stood there, paralyzed by indecision, pretending to be deep in thought, the takeout bag in my hand growing heavier and heavier.



Then I made a mistake.



I knocked on the middle door. The one with the Orthodox cross. Because it felt right in that moment, because my frantic brain was convinced it had solved the puzzle with pure intuitive genius.



The door opened.



Not inward, like a normal door. But outward, and fast, slamming into me and knocking me back a few steps. I stumbled, leaning against the opposite wall, and looked up.



The thing standing in the doorway wasn't human. It had a human shape, a woman in a tattered Victorian dress, hair hanging over her face—but the proportions were wrong. Too tall. Arms too long. Too many joints in her fingers.



"You're not my dinner," she said, her voice like wind whistling through a broken windowpane. "You're the delivery boy. You chose wrong."



"I—" I took a few steps back. "I'm sorry. Wrong apartment. I'll just—"



"It's too late for that now." She stepped into the hallway, and where her feet touched the floor, the wood instantly rotted. "You knocked on the door. You opened the door. You attracted our attention. There will be consequences."



The other two doors opened.



From the left door emerged a man who looked like a priest, but his cross was upside down, and his eyes were empty sockets, oozing black oil.



From the right door emerged a child, about six years old, but children don't smile like that. And children don't have teeth that sharp.



"Three doors," the woman said. "The three of us." We waited so long, and finally someone knocked on the door. We were so hungry.”



This was bad. This was really bad. The earlier manic confidence vanished without a trace, replaced by the cold, clear-headedness of genuine fear.



I pulled out my phone and dialed Marcus's private number.  Since the operator was probably off duty, he answered after only one ring.



“Eric. It’s two in the morning. You’d better have a good explanation—”



“I chose wrong,” I said, backing away down the corridor as the three things advanced towards me. “The door. I chose the wrong door. I need help.”



A moment of silence. Then: “You didn’t finish reading the text, did you?”



“I, uh, no. I was too impulsive. I thought I could—”



“Where exactly are you?”



“Second floor. The corridor. There are three things coming towards me. They look very hungry.”



“Stall them. Don’t let them touch you. Don’t accept anything they offer. I’ll be there in five minutes. If you die before then, I can’t help you.”



The woman tilted her head. “Is that your manager? How responsible. But he won’t make it in time. When we want to be fast, we’re very fast.”



I needed to buy time. I needed to keep them interested, but not let them become aggressive. My hand went into my pocket, finding the pamphlet, my fingers anxiously flipping through the pages, my eyes fixed on the approaching creatures.



I found the text. I read the rest of it:



If you choose wrong, the fae will appear. They are ancient, existing before the boundaries were solidified. They are always hungry. They will make deals with you, trading your voice for safe passage, your memories for protection, your name for your life. Do not accept anything. This company was founded by the God of Famine himself, to maintain the boundaries. Invoke the founder’s protection, and they must stop.



I straightened up, trying to sound more confident than I felt. “I invoke the protection of the God of Famine. This delivery is under the protection of the Ouroboros. You must let me pass.” The three creatures stopped. The woman hissed, revealing layers of teeth.



“Ouroboros,” she spat. “Always Ouroboros. Always taking the best things for itself.” But she still took a step back.



“He has the right,” the priest-like creature said reluctantly. “The contract has been signed. The boundaries have been drawn. We cannot touch those protected by the serpent god.”



The child pouted. “But we’re so hungry. We haven’t had a proper meal in decades. Can’t we just have a little bit? Just his shadow? He won’t even notice.”



“No,” the woman said, though it sounded regretful. “The rules are clear. The God of Famine keeps his promises, and we must too, even if we’re starving.” Footsteps sounded on the stairs. Marcus appeared.



“Goblins,” Marcus said calmly, his tone as if discussing the weather. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen your kind. I didn’t expect you to be making your home in a boundary building.”



“Marcus.” The woman’s voice changed, becoming almost respectful. “After all these years, you’re still doing messenger work?”



“Someone has to. Eric, which door is the real one?”



“I… I don’t know. That’s the problem.”



Marcus sighed. “The crude cross. Always the crude cross. The older and simpler the symbol, the more powerful it is. The fancy ones are just distractions.” He walked past the three goblins, who watched him but didn’t move, and Marcus knocked on the fourth door, the one with the simple cross.



An ordinary human voice answered, “Hello? Who is it?”



“Delivery,” Marcus called out. “Chicken curry.”



The door opened, swinging inward like a normal door, revealing a perfectly ordinary room. A young woman in pajamas opened the door. “Oh, thank goodness, I’m starving. Sorry, I thought I heard someone talking? What are my neighbors up to now?”



“Nothing to worry about, ma’am.” Marcus took the takeout bag from my trembling hands and handed it to her. She paid, gave a generous tip, and closed the door.



The elves watched us with a mixture of frustration and a touch of reverence.



Marcus turned to me. "Eric. Let's go."



"Wait," the woman said. "I have a question for this messenger. Do you know who you work for? Do you understand the true meaning of the Ouroboros?"



"I..." I looked at Marcus, then frantically flipped through the booklet. "The booklet says the company was founded by Famine, and it's an Ouroboros. A snake that devours its own tail."



Marcus didn't speak until we were in the car.



"Yes," Marcus said. "That's right. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Famine, is real, Eric. It's one of the fundamental forces that make up the universe, given form. It's the hunger that drives all existence. Every sixty years, it must devour itself, must consume its own essence to restart the cycle. That's the meaning of our existence. To ensure the cosmic cycle continues."



"You work for a god?" I whispered.



"Not a god. Something older than gods. Something more fundamental. To them, humans are like goldfish, and the fae are the cats that steal the goldfish." Marcus started the car.



"That's terrifying," was all I could say.



"That's why we have rules. That's why we follow procedures. That's why we feed the creatures that live in the cracks. Someone has to do this job, Eric. Someone has to walk the line, keeping the two sides as separate as possible. But it's not entirely possible, like... in London. The real London is beneath London, and every year a few humans accidentally take the King's Cross train to the real London, instead of Soho."



We drove back to the warehouse in silence. I sat in the passenger seat, the frantic energy finally fading, leaving only exhaustion and shame.



"I'm sorry," I finally said. "I should have finished reading that record. I should have called earlier. I was so hyped up, I thought—"



"You thought you could handle it alone. I know." “Marcus glanced at me. “Eric, I’m going to tell you something I wouldn’t tell most couriers. This job finds people like you because you already have one foot in the borderlands of two worlds, you can perceive things that others can’t. That makes you valuable. But it also makes you vulnerable.”



“So I’m a broken person?”



“You’re just different. There’s a difference.” He drove the car into the warehouse parking lot. “You’re one of the best couriers I’ve ever managed, you just need to know when to ask for help. Because I still need you.”



“I chose the wrong door,” I said softly, and Marcus didn’t reply.



“Can I ask a question? About the Famine?”



“Ask away.”



“If something like God is so powerful, so fundamental… can it be killed?”



“No,” Marcus said simply. “It can’t. God doesn’t live in the way you understand life; God simply exists. It has always existed and will always exist. All we can do is maintain our relationship with it.”



“Have you seen it? The Famine?”



Marcus gave that most standard of smiles. “Oh, yes. Many times. I’ll eventually encounter it again. Every manager does, at least once. It’s part of the final evaluation.”



“Final evaluation of what?”



“Whether you get promoted to management. Or switch to something else.” He got out of the car, telling me to return the car to him tomorrow. “But that’s for later.



“Go home. Get a good night’s sleep. Take a day off tomorrow. No deliveries. Doctor’s orders.”



“You’re not a doctor.”



“I’m seven hundred years old. Close enough.” He paused. “Eric? Have a good holiday.”



I didn’t know that ,six months later, I would meet the Famine myself.
