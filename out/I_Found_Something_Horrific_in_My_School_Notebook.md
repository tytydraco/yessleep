I woke up at around 1am and I couldn't fall back asleep. After a bit, I decided to get up to play video games. The internet was out. I decided to do something productive instead, finish my essay for Filipino class. When I grabbed my notebook from my backpack something fell out. It was a black and white picture of me but, distorted. It seemed like the spiral filter was applied to it. I thought to myself, maybe my sister put it in there as a joke. I flipped through the pages to see if there was anything else in there. Nothing, literally nothing. All my notes have disappeared. Is this the wrong notebook? It didn't make sense though, I don't physically leave the house for school. There was no way I could have switched notebooks with someone. I was certain it was the same notebook that I always use, it was in my bag, it was plain, blue, there was a spiral running through the pages. IT WAS MY REGULAR NOTEBOOK.

   
 

I suddenly felt a chill up my spine.

   
 

I looked behind me, there was nothing. I stood up and completely turned around, then I hear a BANG. Just, a singular loud knock from the door. The sound startled me causing me to drop the notebook. When the pages opened and I saw what was on the back, I actually friggin' felt my pupils constrict. It was a photo of a murder, I don't need to get into details, I don't even want to recall it. Below the photo it was the year I was born, 2007 (I'm not sure if itâ€™s related to the photo). Below that is even worse than the photo it was this: "I'm in your house". I barricaded my door and windows then hid inside the walk-in closet. I brought the notebook with me out of instinct, it might be important.

   
 

I scanned thoroughly scanned through the rest of the notebook, but there was nothing else. I heard the door creaking open, footsteps, then absolute silence. I was screwed, I just knew it. After a bit I hear a piece of paper slide under the door. Written on it was: "You're in the closet". The door once again creaked. Then it was silence for the rest of the night.

   
 

I did not sleep at all since 1am. I didn't leave the closet until I had confirmation that my parents were downstairs and alive. The whole night I was terrified. I thought about checking the notebook again to see if there was something new, but I decided against it. I told my parents about absolutely everything in crucial detail even if it was hard to recall. They then scheduled an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist and psychologist on Saturday and Sunday respectively. 

   
 

I bet your wondering what I did with the notebook. NOTHING, it's still with me. I plan to show it to my psychs so that I have evidence of my trauma. I opted to sleep with my parents for the next few nights though, just until I can get past this.
