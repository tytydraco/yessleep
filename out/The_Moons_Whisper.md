I’ve lived in the same coastal town my whole life. The kind of place where the air smells like salt and the horizon stretches endlessly, with the silhouettes of fishing boats. Nothing much happens here, but the ocean has a way of whispering secrets if you’re quiet enough to listen. And last week, I heard something I wish I hadn’t.

It began with the moon.

The moon over our town has always seemed larger than anywhere else, glowing amber as it rises above the water. But on Tuesday night, it was wrong. Too close, too sharp, its edges almost… jagged. It hung low in the sky, casting long shadows that made the world feel stretched and distorted.

I was walking back from the docks, my boots crunching over loose gravel, when I noticed it. A faint hum, so low it felt like it was vibrating in my chest. I paused, straining to hear, and the hum grew louder, rhythmic, nearly melodic. It wasn’t coming from the ocean or the town. It was coming from above.

I tilted my head toward the moon, and the sound sharpened, like a choir singing just out of tune. For a moment, I thought I could hear words, strange and guttural, curling in the air like smoke. My skin prickled as the shadows on the ground began to shift—not with the wind, but with the rhythm of the sound.

The shadows moved...

I froze as one stretched toward me, impossibly long, branching like the tendrils of an ancient tree. I ran, the sound of my boots swallowed by the hum that seemed to echo through my skull. By the time I reached my house, the sound had stopped, but the silence felt worse. I locked the doors and curtains and didn’t look outside.

The next morning, I found my front yard covered in strange patterns, like something had dragged long, clawed fingers through the dirt. My neighbor stood in her driveway, staring at her house. Her windows were cracked, splintered outward, as if something had pressed against them from the inside. She didn’t say a word when I asked what had happened—just pointed toard the moon, now pale and dull in the daylight.

That night, the hum returned. This time, it was louder. The shadows beneath my door flickered, and for a moment, I thought I saw something crawl past the window—a shape that didn’t move like any animal I knew. It had too many legs.

I wanted to run, but when I reached for my keys, the sound changed. It wasn’t a hum anymore. It was a voice. My voice.

“Come outside.”

I slammed my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. The sound wasn’t coming from outside; it was inside me, wrapping around my thoughts, pulling me toward the door. My hand trembled on the doorknob as the hum built into a crescendo, vibrating through the walls, the floors, my very bones.

Then, silence.

I opened the door.

The moon hung low in the sky, closer than it had any right to be. And beneath its jagged glow stood a figure, its body shifting like liquid shadow, its face… my face. It tilted its head, mimicking my movements exactly, and smiled.

This morning, the patterns in my yard were gone. My neighbor’s windows were untouched. The moon was soft and round again, as though nothing had happened. But the hum hasn’t left. It’s quieter now, just a faint vibration in my chest.

And when I look at my reflection in the mirror, it doesn’t quite move when I do...
