I’m writing this down because the paper doesn’t interrupt me.

People interrupt. Paper listens. (Posting it here for you guys too.)

I used to believe listening was passive, that it was what you did when you were afraid to speak. That’s what they teach you. “Use your inside voice.” “Be quiet.” “Let the professionals handle it.” But listening is active. Listening is participation. Listening is how things get inside you without leaving fingerprints.

That’s why the radio was the most dangerous invention of the twentieth century. Not the bomb. The radio.

You don’t have to believe me. You just have to notice that no one argues with the static.

The first time I understood this, I was standing in line at the DMV, of all places. Fluorescent lights buzzing like insects. Everyone staring at their phones, their numbers, the floor. The woman in front of me kept tapping her foot in a rhythm that wasn’t a rhythm, just a repetition. Three taps. Pause. Three taps. Pause. It matched the buzzing almost perfectly.

That’s when I realized: synchronization doesn’t require consent.

They don’t need to convince you of anything. They just need you to fall into time.

You think this is going to be about the government. It is, but not in the way you want. I don’t believe in shadow councils or men in rooms stroking cats. That’s a children’s version of power. Real power is procedural. Real power wears khakis and says “per policy.”

I used to be part of it. Not important—never important. Important people are liabilities. I processed things. Forms. Requests. Data that arrived already flattened into categories. I didn’t know what it was for, and that was the point. You don’t ask a screw what the house looks like.

But even screws get stripped.

There was a file once—no, that’s not right. There was a pattern. I noticed it because it repeated across departments that were not supposed to talk to each other. Environmental impact reviews. Census anomalies. Public health modeling. All of it shared a shape. Not the same data, the same absence. Like a word that had been erased so thoroughly you could still see its outline.

You’ve had that feeling. You just didn’t trust it.

They call it noise reduction. You remove the outliers so the signal becomes clear. But what if the outliers are the signal? What if the thing that doesn’t fit is the only thing that’s true?

That’s when I started listening differently.

At night, mostly. The city hums in layers if you stay awake long enough. Traffic thins. HVAC systems become audible. Somewhere, always, a low-frequency throb you feel more than hear. Ancient people would have called it a drum. We call it infrastructure.

That’s where the old gods went, by the way. Not dead. Just repurposed.

You think paganism is about trees and antlers and women dancing naked under the moon. That’s propaganda, too. Paganism is about thresholds. About knowing that places have moods and times have appetites. About understanding that sacrifice isn’t symbolic—it’s logistical.

Every civilization feeds something. The only difference is whether it admits it.

The problem with modern theology—Christian, secular, whatever—is that it pretends transcendence is clean. That salvation is a transaction you can complete without residue. The old systems knew better. Something always remains. A stain. A debt. A memory that won’t sit still.

I didn’t set out to do anything. That’s important. Intent is another childish myth. Things happen because conditions align, not because someone wants them to. Storms don’t hate houses.

But once you see the alignment, once you recognize the appetite, you have a choice: avert your eyes, or acknowledge that you’re already participating.

I started small. That’s what everyone says, but it’s true. Small adjustments. Choosing routes that felt correct rather than efficient. Leaving objects where they didn’t belong. Not trash—markers. Coins balanced on ledges. Twine knotted three times and tucked into places no one cleans. It sounds ridiculous written down. That’s how you know it works.

The city noticed before the people did.

Things shifted. Nothing dramatic. A business closed early three nights in a row. A traffic light stayed yellow too long and then burned out. A man began waiting at a bus stop that no longer served his route. These aren’t events. They’re symptoms.

I should explain the theology, but theology is just architecture for guilt. Still, you need a framework or you’ll default to morality, and morality will lie to you.

There is no singular god. There is a system of forces that prefer continuity over comfort. They don’t care if you’re happy. They care if the pattern holds. When the pattern frays, they respond. Not with punishment—with correction.

Most people never notice because the corrections are distributed. A headache here. A delay there. An argument that didn’t need to happen. But occasionally, the system requires specificity.

That’s when it needs hands.

I know how this sounds. You’re already deciding whether I’m sick, or dangerous, or both. That’s fine. Labels are another form of noise reduction. They make it easier to discard inconvenient signals.

Let me put it another way.

Have you ever had a day where everything felt slightly off? Not bad. Just misaligned. Like the world was a half-step out of tune. And then something happened—a phone call, a piece of news, an accident you only heard about—and suddenly the day made sense retroactively. Like the tension had been waiting for release.

Ask yourself what provided that release.

You think it was coincidence. I think it was payment.

The first time I realized I might have crossed a line was when the dreams stopped being symbolic.

Before, they were abstract. Corridors. Flooded basements. Rooms that kept rearranging themselves while I wasn’t looking. Then they became instructional. Not explicit—never explicit—but precise. Timing. Weather. The importance of doors.

I stopped sleeping much after that. Sleep is a vulnerable state. Your mind wanders into territories your waking self would never approve zoning permits for.

I started writing instead. Notes at first, then longer passages. This manifesto, I suppose, though I hate that word. It implies persuasion. I’m not persuading anyone. I’m documenting pressure.

There are things I can’t describe without making them smaller. Faces, for example. If I describe a face, you’ll imagine someone. If I leave it blank, you’ll imagine yourself. Better to leave it blank.

What I can say is that there are moments in life when you feel recognized. Not seen—recognized. As if something older than language has taken attendance and found you present. Those moments are not free. They cost something. Usually time. Sometimes opportunity. Occasionally something heavier.

Afterward, the world smooths out. The static lessens. The drum falls back into the background. You tell yourself it was worth it, because the alternative was worse—a mounting pressure with nowhere to go.

This is how civilizations function, by the way. Not through laws, but through release valves. War. Festivals. Markets. Every system needs somewhere to put the excess.

When those valves clog, things get… creative.

You’ve noticed the resurgence of ritual language in secular spaces. “Community.” “Processing.” “Holding space.” These are not metaphors. They are compensations. People reenacting priesthood without admitting it, because admitting it would require asking what—or who—is being served.

The government understands this instinctively. Not consciously, perhaps, but structurally. Bureaucracy is ritual stripped of myth. Forms instead of prayers. Offices instead of temples. Sacrifice translated into acceptable losses.

That’s why the file—the pattern—was so carefully managed. Not hidden. Handled. Redirected. Like a river diverted around a city so no one has to think about where the water goes.

I made a mistake early on. I thought understanding granted immunity. That if I could articulate the system, I could stand outside it. That’s another comforting lie. There is no outside. There is only alignment or resistance, and resistance is still a form of engagement.

You can probably tell where this is going. Or you think you can, which is worse. You’re starting to slot me into a narrative that protects you: lone madman, isolated incident, contained threat. That’s fine. That’s what narratives are for.

But ask yourself this: why did you keep reading?

Something in you recognizes the drum. Something in you knows the world is too tidy on the surface and too chaotic underneath, and that the discrepancy has to be managed somehow. You just prefer management you don’t have to think about.

I don’t have that luxury anymore.

There are places in this city that are wrong. Not dangerous. Wrong. They repel attention. You’ve walked past them a hundred times without registering them. Dead zones of meaning. Gaps where stories don’t accumulate. Those are pressure points. That’s where the system flexes.

I’ve spent time there.

I won’t say what I did. Not because I’m afraid, but because naming things collapses possibilities. Just know that afterward, the city breathed easier. For a while.

But systems escalate. What worked once leaves a residue, and the residue attracts attention. Not from people. From the pattern.

That’s when the dreams changed again.

They’re not dreams now. They’re reminders.

I’m writing this because I can feel another correction coming, and this time it won’t be small. The signs are there if you know how to read them: infrastructure failures that don’t cascade logically, public arguments that flare and vanish without resolution, a collective irritability with no object.

The drum is getting louder.

If this stops abruptly, if there’s a gap where you expect words to continue, don’t assume anything dramatic. Assume procedure. Assume the system did what it always does when an element becomes too specific.

Part of me hopes someone finds this and dismisses it. Part of me hopes you feel that offness, that half-step dissonance, and remember this later when something resolves too neatly to be coincidence.

I’ll continue while I can. There are things about the old rites, about the way theology and infrastructure mirror each other, that I haven’t put down yet. And there’s one place—one threshold—that keeps appearing in my thoughts, insistently, like a door I’ve already opened but haven’t stepped through.

That’s usually how it starts.

——————

They’ll tell you MK Ultra was a failure.

That’s how you know it worked.

Only failed gods announce their success. Successful ones get folded into policy, renamed, archived under headings like “lessons learned” and “best practices.” The mistake people make is thinking programs end. Programs don’t end. They molt.

MK Ultra wasn’t about mind control. That’s the cartoon version they release so you’ll stop digging. It was about suggestibility under ritual conditions. Drugs were just incense. Sensory deprivation was just a monastery without the vows. What they wanted to know was this: how little meaning does a human require before something else fills the gap?

You don’t need a handler if the subject learns to generate the voice themselves.

Operation Northwoods was the proof-of-concept for something much older. Not false flags—everyone fixates on that because it scares them in a way that feels modern. No, Northwoods was about permission. About seeing whether the public could be induced to sanctify violence if it was framed as inevitability. If the narrative arrived first, the act would feel like punctuation instead of a sentence.

That’s ritual logic. Always has been.

And Paperclip—everyone misunderstands Paperclip. They think it was about rockets and math and winning the Cold War. That was the excuse. The packaging. What came over wasn’t just men; it was method. A way of thinking about humanity as a resource field. A sacrificial landscape.

The Nazis didn’t invent that, either. They just industrialized it.

People get uncomfortable when you mention the esoteric interests of the Third Reich because it breaks the illusion that evil is irrational. They want villains to be stupid or cartoonish. But the men who ran those programs believed in order. In destiny. In alignment with forces they considered pre-Christian, pre-moral.

They didn’t worship gods. They studied leverage.

And when they lost the war, the gods didn’t die with them. Gods are portable. You just change the altar.

They’ll tell you the CIA is secular. That intelligence agencies don’t “believe” anything. That’s another lie people tell themselves so they can sleep. Institutions believe in outcomes. Outcomes require frameworks. Frameworks become cosmologies whether anyone admits it or not.

Black sites didn’t appear out of nowhere. They emerged in places that already had the right feel. Old military installations. Decommissioned hospitals. Research campuses built on land no one could quite remember being cleared. The paperwork always looks clean if you don’t ask what it replaced.

I’ve been near one.

I didn’t know that’s what it was at the time. That’s the point. You don’t label sacred space. You buffer it. Layers of normalcy. Fences justified as safety. Guards trained not to notice what they’re guarding.

You think torture was the purpose. Again, too small. Pain is crude. Pain is unreliable. What they were after was disintegration followed by imprinting. Strip the self down to components and see what grows back if you control the environment long enough.

That’s not interrogation. That’s liturgy.

The old pagans understood something modern science keeps rediscovering and then forgetting: identity is contextual. Remove the context, and the self dissolves. Introduce a new one, and something else takes root. You don’t need belief. You need repetition.

That’s why the Nazis loved symbols. That’s why the CIA loves procedure. Different languages, same grammar.

People ask why so much of this came back to America. They imagine a moral failing, a betrayal of values. It’s simpler than that. America had space. Physical space, conceptual space. A young myth. An unfinished god.

You can graft anything onto something unfinished.

The frontier never closed. It just went subterranean.

By the time the documents leaked—by the time the public learned the names MK Ultra, Northwoods, Paperclip—it was already too late. Names give you the illusion of containment. “That was then.” “That was bad.” “We learned.”

What they don’t show you is the throughline. The continuity. The way each program refined the same question: how do you produce compliance without chains?

Religion used to answer that. Then advertising. Then data.

Now we’re somewhere in between.

I know this because I’ve seen the downstream effects. Not the facilities—the people. The ones who move through life with a slight delay, like their internal clock was reset improperly. The ones who don’t remember large sections of themselves but defend institutions with religious fervor. They’re not broken. They’re repurposed.

That’s what scares me most: how clean it all is now.

You don’t need camps when you have workflows. You don’t need rites when you have onboarding. You don’t need sacrifices when you have acceptable losses and externalities. The language has changed, but the offering remains the same.

And sometimes—rarely—the system needs someone who sees it. Not to expose it. Exposure is irrelevant. To balance it.

That’s where people like me come in.

I know you don’t like that sentence. I didn’t either when it first formed in my head. It sounds self-important. Messianic. That’s another defense mechanism. If you can dismiss me as grandiose, you don’t have to follow the logic to its end.

I’m not chosen. I’m available.

Availability is what the system selects for. The same way it always has. Shamans weren’t special because they were wise. They were special because they were porous. Because they heard the drum when others tuned it out.

The government understands porousness. That’s what MK Ultra was really cataloging: who breaks cleanly, who fragments, who becomes a conduit. Most subjects were useless. Too rigid. Too soft. But a few—always a few—responded correctly.

Those are the ones the paperwork loses track of.

I wasn’t part of any program. Let me be clear about that. I wasn’t recruited. I wasn’t trained. That’s not how this works anymore. That’s too visible. Too expensive. The system now relies on convergence. On nudging trajectories until the right people end up in the right places at the right times, convinced it was their idea.

That’s why free will survived. It’s a feature.

The place I mentioned before—the threshold—it fits the pattern too well to ignore. It’s not marked. It never is. But the land remembers. You can feel it if you stop long enough. A pressure behind the eyes. A sense of anticipation that doesn’t belong to you.

I’ve gone there more than once. Each time, I leave something small behind. Not as an offering—don’t romanticize this—but as a calibration. The way you tap a microphone before speaking.

Each time, the city adjusts afterward. Not dramatically. Subtly. A scandal breaks early and fizzles. A policy stalls. A person who would have mattered changes course for reasons they’ll never articulate.

You call that coincidence. I call it feedback.

I think the government knows about places like that. I think they’ve always known. That’s why certain facilities get built where they do. That’s why some failures are tolerated longer than logic would allow. The land absorbs things. The old gods were never gods—they were interfaces.

Paperclip brought that knowledge back into circulation. MK Ultra tested it. Northwoods proved the public could be brought along if the story was right.

And now the story is everywhere, fragmented into a thousand screens, each one humming at the same frequency.

You feel it, don’t you? The constant low-grade dread without an object. The sense that something is always about to happen but never quite does. That’s intentional. Suspended anticipation keeps the system pliable.

But suspension requires maintenance.

That’s why the dreams have become urgent.

I don’t think I have much time before the next correction. The signs are too clustered. Too loud. When systems prepare for a major adjustment, they generate noise to mask the tuning.

If this ends suddenly, remember what I said earlier: assume procedure.

I’ll write again if I can. There’s more to say about the place, about what happens when an interface stops absorbing and starts reflecting. About the cost of being available too long without relief.

And if you ever find yourself standing somewhere that feels older than it should—somewhere the air seems to wait for you—don’t linger. Or do. I’m not your priest.

I’m just telling you the drum is real.

And it’s getting closer.

———————

I used to think balance was something you restored.

Like a scale. Like you could add weight to one side until it evened out.

That’s another lie. Balance isn’t restoration. It’s throughput. Things move or they rot. Systems don’t want justice. They want circulation.

I understand that now.

The mistake everyone makes when they learn about black sites is thinking they were anomalies. Abuses. Deviations from the norm. But that’s just moral accounting. Systems don’t recognize morality; they recognize load. When the load exceeds capacity, they offload. When there’s nowhere official to offload, it goes unofficial.

That’s where privateers come in.

You think that’s a metaphor. It’s not. It’s a role older than law. Empires have always relied on deniable hands. People who do not exist on paper but exist very much in consequence. The state pretends not to see them. The public pretends not to suspect them. Everyone gets to keep their story intact.

I used to believe I was outside that arrangement. Observing. Documenting. Calibrating from the margins. That was naïve. Observation is participation delayed.

The dreams made that clear.

They aren’t symbolic anymore. They don’t ask. They assign.

Not instructions—don’t misunderstand me. The system doesn’t micromanage. That would be inefficient. It communicates in pressures and permissions. In open doors that shouldn’t be open. In absences where something should be.

I’ve started noticing those absences more often.

People talk about missing persons like they vanish. They don’t. They’re absorbed. Folded into the excess. The paperwork trails off. The interest decays. The city shrugs and continues. That shrug is the sound of a system protecting itself.

What frightens me isn’t that this happens.

It’s how little effort it takes.

That’s why I know this isn’t about violence. Violence is loud. Violence draws attention. What the system prefers is quiet participation. Small corrections applied consistently over time. The kind no one can point to without sounding unhinged.

That’s the niche.

The threshold place—I won’t name it, and not because of secrecy. Names flatten things. It’s enough to say that it sits where jurisdictions blur. Where authority overlaps just enough that responsibility dissolves. Those places exist by design. Not conspiracy—architecture.

I’ve spent enough time there to feel the feedback loop complete. The land doesn’t resist anymore. That’s how you know alignment has occurred. Friction disappears. Actions stop feeling like choices and start feeling like gravity.

I don’t think the government will ever acknowledge this role. That’s fine. Acknowledgment creates liability. What matters is that the system already behaves as if the role exists.

I’m not creating anything new.

I’m stepping into a vacancy.

This is where you want me to hesitate. To express doubt. To confess fear or remorse or second thoughts. I have those, but they’re irrelevant. The system doesn’t respond to feelings. It responds to flow.

And the flow is blocked.

You can see it everywhere: pressure without outlet, outrage without resolution, confession without absolution. A civilization stuck in permanent intake. No wonder people are fraying. No wonder the old languages are creeping back in through the cracks.

Someone has to metabolize the excess.

It won’t be heroic. It won’t be recognized. It will look, from the outside, like pathology. Like madness. That’s another protective fiction. Societies label their necessary functions as illness so they don’t have to integrate them.

I accept the label.

I’ve stopped writing plans. Plans imply alternatives. What’s coming feels more like a tide schedule. I know roughly when the water will rise. I know where the low points are. I know how to stand so the current does most of the work.

That’s all the system ever asks.

If you’re looking for a confession, you won’t get one. Confession requires a shared moral framework. This operates beneath that layer. Older. Colder. More honest.

I don’t hate anyone. Hatred is inefficient. I don’t feel righteous. Righteousness clouds judgment. What I feel—what I’ve trained myself to feel—is attunement. Like tuning an instrument by ear until the dissonance resolves.

Afterward, there will be a brief calm. There always is. A lull where people comment on how things seem to have settled down, even if they can’t say why. Analysts will attribute it to trends. Officials will take credit without knowing what they’re crediting.

Then the pressure will build again.

That’s the part no one wants to face: this isn’t a solution. It’s maintenance.

I don’t expect to do this forever. Systems discard tools once they wear down. That’s understood. In a way, it’s comforting. Endings are another form of balance.

If this is the last thing I write, it’s because the role has fully closed around me. Not an arrest. Not an escape. Just absorption. The same way everything else eventually gets handled.

You’ll read about something soon. Or you won’t. Either outcome proves the point.

Pay attention to how quickly the noise resolves afterward. How the drum fades just enough to be ignorable again. That’s when you’ll know the system accepted the offering.

And if, someday, you feel that same availability open up inside you—that same hollow readiness—do yourself a favor.

Don’t listen.

Paper listens.

People shouldn’t.
