I've written about this here before, but my post was removed and I was unable to get it back up so here we go again. My apologies if you've read this already but there is more to add... the strange things at the farm have continued to happen more frequently.

Background: The farm where I hunt is about 75 miles outside of St. Louis. I've been hunting there for about 2 years now and that distance away means I have some early morning and late night commutes to and from the farm in the dark. It's a beautiful property with a rustic but modern log cabin, a German style barn from the 1800s built into the side of the hill, a fishing pond, and more than enough fields and woods to hunt. I love it there.

As much as I love it, the things I've seen out there have made me very uneasy. I'm just going to start by outlining the first few encounters I had on and around the farm.

April 2022: It was opening day for the Spring Turkey season. I was out bright and early and had a mature Gobbler tagged and in hand within 45 minutes of sunrise and was back on my way to the city happy as can be. A few things to note about Missouri - you can shoot 2 male turkey's during the entire 3 week season, only 1 turkey may be taken in the first week, and you can only shoot from 30 minutes prior to sunrise to 1 PM. So on that note, I had to wait a week before shooting another turkey.

Fast forward to exactly one week after opening day, I'm on my way back to the farm. I stopped for some Casey's breakfast pizza at about 430 AM as I went through the last bit of civilization until reaching the farm. Once you turn off the main state route the road starts to bend and curve quite a bit for the last 12 miles to the property. Just after 445 AM I'm about a mile or two away from the farm and come through a bend in the road. I have my high beams on in my truck and as I come around the bend my headlights light up a loafing shed that is on the edge of a pasture right along the road. On the roof of the loafing shed was what I can only describe as an all white humanoid figure.

Since the road was curving, it was gone just as quickly as I had seen it. I came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road thinking "WTF WTF" but the loafing shed was in complete darkness at this point. I rolled down my windows to eliminate the glare from my radio screen but it was still just nothing but darkness. I considered backing up to see if it was still there but I decided I didn't want to go toe to toe with a possible skinwalker while my shotgun was still packed away in it's case.

I press on down the road but my mind is stuck on the humanoid figure that I saw. It seemed to be of average height maybe 5' 10" to 6' tall and did not appear to have any clothes on. Standard looking arms and legs. My high beams made it it look like it was pure bright white but I'm sure it was something maybe more along the lines of a pale gray just being lit up really bright.

I get to the farm a few minutes later and when the time comes to get out of my truck I'm freaking out. Looking over my shoulder like maybe the humanoid had followed me. I start fidgeting with the lock on the gate and my mind is winning the battle. But for a less than dramatic end to the day... I stayed in my truck until the first shimmer of daylight before going into the woods to hunt. 1 PM rolled around with no turkey on the day.

May 2022: After a full week of work I was headed out for a third hunt. Same routine, early morning breakfast pizza stop and press. The humanoid figure is top of mind as I make my way closer to the farm. The loafing shed comes into view and it's just as it should be... no possible skinwalker on the roof. I'm immediately relieved and relax as I finish the last couple minutes of the drive.

When I pulled up to the farm, I hopped out to open the gate so I could drive through, but the lock was laying on the ground just below the gate. I thought this was weird but then thought maybe the owner accidentally dropped it last time he left or something. Now the driveway is really long at the farm and once you go through the gate it bends to the left and the cabin comes into view. So after brushing off the lock on the ground I drive through and as I come around to drive towards the cabin and barn I notice a white light dancing around the cabin. Almost like a flashlight darting around if someone were looking for something in the dark. At this point I only have my fog lights on because I turned my headlights off when pulling in just to eliminate lighting up the place I'm about to hunt, but I quickly cut the fogs lights off too so I'm not putting off any light. The white light is definitely moving from room to room inside the cabin.

I backed my truck up to the gate with the headlights off and postured for a quick escape if needed. The owner does not live there full time and was not supposed to be out there that weekend. Regardless, I sent him a text real quick asking if he was in St. Louis or at the farm. It was so early that I wasn't expecting an answer if he was in the city like I thought he was. Waited a few minutes, the light was still going and there was no text back.

I quietly get out of my truck, pistol on hip and shotgun in hand. Yes, I brought the pistol based off the humanoid figure sighting. I walked up to the cabin keeping my distance looking for any parked vehicles or signs of forced entry. There was nothing though other than the light inside. Whoever was in there was not aware of my presence yet based on the way the light seemed to be searching around. I decided to get closer to the kitchen window as it would let me see most of the inside of the main part of the cabin. When I looked in there was a white orb floating in the air in the middle of the room. No human present, no physical body of any sort, just a white orb hovering about 3 feet off the ground... instant chills.

I watch the orb float around the cabin for what felt like an eternity but was really only a few seconds most likely. I began to feel really uneasy and vulnerable being fixated looking through the window. Out of instinct I guess, I jerked my head around to see if anything was sneaking up on me, but there was nothing around me. I turned to look back in the cabin and it was pitch black. The white orb was gone.

When I tell you I ran back to my truck like a school girl... I did. I still wanted to hunt that day but there was no way I was venturing out in the dark. I laid low in the truck for about an hour and at the crack of dawn I get a text from the owner. He said he was in St. Louis... which I had figured out by this point. I did not say anything further to him about what I had seen.

Day breaks and I was feeling brave enough to go sit for the hunt. Didn't see anything that I could shoot that day so by 1 PM I was heading back to the truck. There were still 2 days left in the hunting season and I still had a tag to fill but I decided I had seen enough and needed a break and some company the next time I came out.

I wasn't planning on being back until mid August to get my trail cameras and tree stands set up for deer season in September and I figured that would be enough time to let things cool down and put my mind at ease. Turns out I was naive to think time heals all wounds especially with the paranormal or whatever you want to call it but things continued the more I went out.

I have to get back to work here in a minute so this is all I have time for today. I will post again soon to share more of what happened from fall of 2022 until now.

Also, I have shared these stories with a few people. My dad, who believes every bit of it and tells me to be careful over and over. A friend of mine who is a skinwalker enthusiast. He told me I probably just saw a rural meth head taking a nap on a shed roof. My girlfriend says I'm crazy and that I shouldn't go out there if these things really happen. A few random others have had mixed reactions from "it's not real" to "you're making it up" to "stay strapped". I'm telling you all though, these things happened and it was just the beginning.
