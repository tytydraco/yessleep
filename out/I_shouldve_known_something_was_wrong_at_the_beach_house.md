Me and my wife bought this vacation house after years of saving up money here and there. The place was cozy and small. But it felt like a palace.

I was lounging in the pool of my beach house. The sound of each wave crashing against the shore felt like a lullaby. 

My wife had gone to the ice cream stall by the pier, and my two kids were already playing at the beach.

Maisy was nine and Leia was seven. They would fight every now and then, as siblings do, but they were good pals. Before leaving for the beach, they were wrestling with each other, arguing about who likes strawberry ice cream better. 

They didn’t get to a conclusive decision, but their mommy decided to go and get both of them double scoops of strawberry ice cream as a peace treaty.

I stayed back at the pool as I’ve never been a big fan of the sand. I agreed to buy the beach house because my wife loved the sand and the ocean to bits. Otherwise, I would’ve chosen a nice, cozy ski-cabin.

The day was beautiful. The sun shone bright and the clouds looked like a thick blob of cobwebs. The sky was suddenly a bit darker. Ashy even, but I brushed it off as the arrival of the first summer rain. I remember thanking God for giving me such a happy life.

But I guess I shouldn’t have. I must’ve jinxed it.

Things took a turn for the worst. The absolute worst.



A chill ran down my spine as the breeze suddenly shifted, a sharp cold breeze cut through the warm air. Almost within the blink of an eye, the sky had darkened to a deep gray. 

The air felt heavy. Thick and suffocating.

I couldn’t hear the waves anymore. Everything was quiet. Too quiet. 



I tried to climb out of the pool frantically. A creeping gust of dread took over me and I felt panic rise within my core. I didn’t know why, or how, But I knew that something was very wrong.



I scrambled out of the pool and ran into the house, creating chlorinated puddles all over the living room floor and carpets. I tried to imagine my wife getting mad at me for making a mess, but it didn’t calm me down.

I grabbed the phone with sopping wet hands and dialed my wife’s number. The water on my hands made the touch screen infuriating to use, but I wasn’t in control anymore. The panic was driving me. 

The incessant hum of the refrigerator was the only thing stopping me from crumbling under the deafening silence.

I finally managed to dial her number, but she wasn’t picking up. She wasn’t answering.



By now, the dread had enveloped every inch of me and I couldn’t think straight. The fear was primal, it was animalistic.



The world felt wrong. The floor I stood on, the air I breathed, The heart that was beating inside of me, It all felt deeply wrong. It all felt sinister. It felt foreign. It felt as if I was stuck somewhere alien. 

This wasn’t my world. This wasn’t my body. This wasn’t real.



Everything was too quiet.

Why can’t I hear the waves? Why can’t I hear the wind?

Why is it so quiet?



I ran outside into the backyard and stood on top of the cooler so that I could see over the fence. So that I could see if my children were fine. I just wanted to see them.



The beach was empty.

There wasn’t a single soul on the shore. 

But there was a wave.



This wave was big. It was tall. 

The moment I set my eyes on it, I knew nothing would ever be the same.

The wave was a stormy grey. Streaks of silver at the very top. It was gargantuan and it was unearthly. 

A sinister, truly evil atmosphere surrounded it.



It was massive. It was tall enough to swallow every skyscraper whole. Its sheer vastness defied the laws of nature. It was impossibly massive.

It looked like those massive tidal waves seen in movies, only this was worse. 

I was here, and this was real.



The air felt salty. The wind was violent. Everything around me felt barbaric. Sadistic and cruel.

As I watched the mountainous waves inch closer and closer to the shore, I stood there shivering. 

I realized that I didn’t have time to think. I needed to find my family.



I grabbed the towel that was draped on top of the deck chair, wrapped it around me and ran out to the pier to find my wife.



When I got to the pier, the dread worsened.

The dock was empty. All the stalls were closed up and an unsettling silence hung over it.

*“She must’ve gone to the beach to find the kids. The stalls probably closed up because of whatever the hell this is“* I thought to myself as I ran over to the direction of the beach.

As I got closer and closer to the beach, the sheer size of the wave became impossible to ignore. It was larger than any mountain I’ve seen myself. I couldn’t think of anything that could possibly compare to the size of it.

When I got to the beach, I began to hear a quiet hum.

The closer I got, the sound began to morph into something guttural. 



It was a roar.

The wave was roaring. It was deep, thick and raspy.

I didn’t know why I kept walking forward. I didn’t know why I was doing anything. I just wanted to see my family. I wanted to protect them.

Each step I put forward, the weaker my body felt.

A sense of drowsiness washed over me. I felt my knees buckle. I tried my hardest to hold on, but I could feel myself slip away. 

The wave. It was draining me of life.



I have to find my family.
