My nomadic childhood, courtesy of Dad's military service, landed us in Jammu when I was just a slip of a kid, maybe seven or eight.  This time, unlike the usual sterile confines of the army base, a cozy little house awaited us – a haven built specifically for my comfort. Nestled in a friendly neighborhood, the air buzzed with the warmth of helpful neighbors.  Right next door lived a gentle old couple, their faces etched with a sorrow that spoke volumes of a story untold.  Their son, they revealed, had been a soldier, lost in the unforgiving grip of war.  Their loss resonated with them, yet it didn't stop them from showering me with an unnatural affection, their hearts yearning for the warmth of a grandchild they never had. Their property was a paradise – a sprawling lawn where butterflies danced and guava trees stood sentinel, their green globes dangling like forbidden knowledge.  They knew my sweet tooth all too well and weren't shy about tempting me with their prized fruit.

One suffocating summer night, the relentless heat chased me to the rooftop.  Seeking solace under a canopy of stars, I drifted off to sleep.  Suddenly, a commotion from their lawn jolted me awake.  A violent shaking rattled the guava tree, its leaves whispering secrets in the night wind.  At first, I dismissed it as the wind or a nocturnal animal, but the persistent trembling spurred my curiosity.  Creeping cautiously to the edge of the roof, I peered over.  What I saw that night clawed its way into the deepest recesses of my memory, a scene forever etched in horror.

Clinging to the very same guava tree, their bodies twisted in an unnatural contortion, were the elderly couple.  For a heart-stopping moment, I wondered if I was dreaming, but the heat prickling my skin and the distant rumble of a car confirmed my grim reality.  The scene was utterly bizarre.  Suddenly, the old woman reached out a skeletal hand, a single, withered guava clutched tightly in its grasp.  "Come closer, child," she rasped, her voice a dry whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.  "Take what's yours."  A primal scream choked in my throat, replaced by a blind panic as I stumbled backward.  I ran.  I ran until my lungs burned, until the familiar creak of my own bedframe offered the illusion of safety.  Burying myself under the covers, I tried to shut out the image, but the memory of that warped tableau lingered like a noxious cloud.

The next morning, an unnatural silence hung heavy over the house next door.  Even the birds seemed muted in their morning chorus.  The news report, when it crackled through the radio, felt like a cruel twist of fate.  The elderly couple hadn't been in the city the previous night! They had traveled to a family gathering in their village. On their return trip that night, tragedy struck on a lonely stretch of road.  Their car was a mangled wreck, their lives extinguished in the blink of an eye.
