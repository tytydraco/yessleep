Some background: I volunteer at a food bank once a week. Usually I help with intake: recording each person as they come in. It’s pretty fun. Most people are grateful, and you get to meet people with a lot of…personality :)

One of the people with a lot of “personality” was a man named Jim. He would come in every month or so and always crack jokes. Sometimes he would tell crazy stories. Something about being in a CIA program for “remote viewing” which I think meant something about telepathy.  I’d usually nod and smile. We had to move pretty quickly, so I didn’t really have time to talk to him much. In retrospect, I wish I’d had.

A couple of months ago, the food bank got accepted to a new government program that let us give out more food. The only hiccup was that we had to collect the name and address of the recipients. We were told that we had to get everyone on the new program.

The next time I did intake with Jim, I asked him for his address. Jim was really hesitant.

“What do you need my address for?” he asked.

“It’s part of a new program,” I said.

“What program?” His tone became almost angry, which was very unusual for him. I explained to him as best I could what it was for.

“I don’t give out my address,” he said.

My supervisor told me that we had to get the addresses for everyone, and that the government would do an audit if we didn’t.  If the audit failed, the food bank might get kicked out of the program.

“Look,” I told Jim, “I want to help you but they say I have to get your address otherwise I can’t.”

 Jim looked at me for a while.

“Do you promise you’re not going to share it with anybody?” he asked.

“Absolutely,” I said. Although in retrospect, I really didn’t know what the charity would do with the information.

Jim gave me his address information and I helped make his order.  After we filled up his cart for him, he went back to me and said.

“You remember what you promised about giving out my address. I don’t want anybody to know.”

I smiled and told him that I promised. He got his food and left.

Everything else was normal for the rest of the shift, and nothing unusual happened for the next couple of weeks.  But then one week, at the end of the shift, something very strange happened. A couple of men in suits came into the food bank.  This was very unusual—no one who came to the food bank ever dressed that nicely.  

I figured almost immediately that they were from whatever government office was there to audit the new program, and indeed that was exactly the case. But something felt off. They were all men in their thirties to fifties. Not the usual people you’d see working in social services. And they were very business like and to the point. Again, very untypical of other people in social work that I had met with.

The other thing that was strange was what they did. They asked for the records we’d been keeping, which was normal. We showed it to them, and they started flipping through them. But it didn’t seem like they were checking for whether we’d filled out the forms properly, just quickly looking at them. Honestly, I was a bit relieved since I wanted to go home and I didn’t want to have to answer a bunch of questions about the intake.

But then I saw them do something that concerned me. One of them said something and then stopped. He took out his phone, and took a picture.  Then the others stopped checking, even though they had only gotten half way through the pile.  After they took the picture, they thanked me and left.  I was a little relieved, but when I looked at the page they’d taken a picture of, I saw that it was the one with Jim’s name on it.

We ended the shift. I considered calling Jim to tell him what happened (we had his telephone number too). But I didn’t want to upset someone that was psychologically unwell and feed into his paranoia. It was strange, but I was sure it was nothing.  In retrospect, I’m not so sure anymore.

I didn’t see Jim for the next few weeks.  Which was fine, since he usually only came in once a month.  But after it had gone a few months, I started to grow concerned. I decided to look up his phone and give him a call, but he didn’t answer.

During one of the intakes, I talked to a guy who was one of Jim’s friends. Sometimes they’d both come in together and I’d see them chatting. I asked the friend if he’d heard anything about Jim, and he said “Oh man, didn’t you hear? Jim died a couple of months ago. Had a heart attack or something.”

I felt the pit of my stomach drop. Exactly the same time those men had come in and taken a picture of Jim’s intake form.

I had a hard time concentrating for the rest of the shift. Honestly, the whole thing upset me quite a bit, but I probably would have chalked it up to a really bizarre coincidence if it weren’t for something that happened a few weeks later.  I was at the end of my shift and went to the parking lot. It was mostly empty by that time. As I was walking to my car, however, I saw another car pull up, and the same men get out. They watched me as I went to my vehicle. I was pretty freaked out to be honest. I just wanted to get in my car and go home.

I was almost to my car door when one of them approached me.

“Hey, are you [insert my real name]?” one of them asked.

I paused. I didn’t really want to answer, but it felt awkward not to.

“Yes,” I said.

“Did you know James [Last Name]?” he asked.

“Not sure,” I said. 

“He was one of the people that came to the food bank.”

“Oh, ok.” I tried to play it cool. “I don’t know. Maybe. We work with a lot of people.”  I definitely did not want to tell him that I knew Jim.

The man looked at me. I looked around me. We were the only ones in the parking lot. I felt a sudden chill run down my spine. Everything in my instincts told me to be as careful as possible. To not do or say anything. I’ve never been as afraid in my life as I was at that moment.

After what felt like an eternity, the man thanked me and went on his way. I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. 

Thinking back on it, I feel pretty guilty about what I did.  Should I have just not written down his address? Was I somehow responsible for Jim’s death?

But most of all, I feel grateful that it didn’t go worse than it did. And that I never want to see those men again.
