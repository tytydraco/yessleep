Since I can remember, my family and I have lived in the same house. The same left in shades of peach, ivory and white, in sextile Quintino, Travessa with President Farias. 

Remember nostalgic that in autumn the grass was lined with leaves satisfactorily brittle, brown was predominant throughout the neighborhood. My favorite program was to go out in pajamas on Sunday mornings jumping through all the leaves I could. The "crak, crak" reminded me of the sound of toasts being bitten.

In winter there was no snow as I saw on TV, but the sun came accompanied by a freezing wind that seemed to hold my cheeks like a loving mother. Of course, after some time the cold seemed to slap me more. 

In the spring the beautiful garden that my father cultivated was deliciously alive. Lush colors, blossoms that danced happily and splashed their scent when the cool breeze visited us, which was not uncommon, with so many trees adorning the whole neighborhood. It was the greenest block in the entire city, perhaps in the whole state. I like to think so.

Already in the summer, that’s where I was happy. The sun bothered us no matter where we went. 

When it dawned, the light was lighter than the alarm clocks in the house. I insisted on having a thin curtain, because I liked my room being invaded by orange light, loved the arrangement that the heat brought as a gift. 

We didn’t need bulbs until at least 7 o'clock, I felt in an enchanted kingdom. Mint ice cream, fresh clothes and a long day. 

In adolescence little has changed. Some neighbors have moved, according to my parents. The strange thing is that I never really saw a change happen. Everyone was aging there, when suddenly they were no longer. Most of the time the children remained there, in the rest of the cases, when there was no heir, the house simply succumbed to abandonment.

In my adolescence almost nothing has changed. Some neighbors have moved, according to my parents. The strange thing is that I never really saw a change happen. Everyone was aging there, when suddenly they were no longer. Most of the time the children remained there, in other cases, when there was no heir, the house simply succumbed to abandonment. 

Only after adult I understood: there was no change. They died. People die. But the feeling I had is that no one really left this place.

The few times I tried to enter any of the houses, my mother or father would stop me. Even after adult, curiosity has always been a very strong characteristic in me, but now I think it’s a defect, a lot of defect. 

On any Saturday, my brother marked with Mark and other friends to leave, I asked; I begged, to accompany them, he was already 16 years old and James, my brother, was about 18, I felt that I could finally get together with his group, but the answer was a direct and straight "no". All right, I would help our mother to bake colorful and tasty cakes and would make sure to eat them until there is no piece left for him.

But that’s not how things happened. 

Mark had arrived at our house at 11 o'clock in the morning, the two left around 11:15. We had no news until 21:40, my mother walked pale around the house, sweating and trembling, whispering with my father inaudible words, but I could see despair in the eyes of both, their faces were works of concern, very clear.

When the clock struck at 22:20 and Thiago and much less Marcos answered the calls, after many attempts to call, my parents knocked from door to door in the neighborhood, in the neighbors that were still there. I was forced to stay on the balcony, without putting my feet out. My grandmother stroked my back while I watched the commotion, holding a plate with two pieces of cake, waiting for my brother. At that moment I swore that I would never think of leaving him without our mother’s cakes.

It was when a shadow came slowly, almost seemed to drag, from the end of the street. The poles no longer worked as before, so some blinked and others didn’t even work anymore. Some of the men stepped forward trying to see who was coming. Here’s the surprise: Mark was coming as if he had just witnessed the most traumatic scene of his life. 

— Hey, son. What happened? - Mr. Cree asked my brother’s friend. I leaned over the balcony to try to understand better, but all I could see were Mark’s eyes. I will never forget. The lifeless eyes, without brightness. He was soulless.

It was when I noticed the spasms of his arms, he staggered to the men who were there, I could see his shirt, earlier super clean and passed, stained by dry tones of a reddish brown, his appearance was terrible.

Without saying a single word, he pointed to the old Cordhogan house. They were the first to disappear. No news of death, no moving truck, no funeral. Simply disappeared... 

My mother choked a scream with her hands and it seemed for a moment that the ground had pulled her down, if not for the ladies holding her shoulders. 

\- Stay here. Do not move, Dani. No. Leave. - my grandmother said before running to the street to meet the group that formed there.

I wanted to follow her, not because I was rude, but it was my brother, I had the right to know what was happening. 

I held firmly the plate and followed it with firm steps. That’s when I regretted a little. 

My mother cried copiously on the shoulder of one of the neighbors.

My grandmother opened her mouth to scold me, but I saw her willpower go away, she just hugged her elbows. Suddenly a cold air flooded the street. I felt my hairs rise, I no longer had the same courage as when I was on the balcony. Knew that something bad and wrong was happening at this time, very wrong even. 

My father sighed loudly, avoiding to look at my mother or me. It was when I looked up at the window of the Costa house. Mrs. Costa watched us, very close to the glass, his breath blurring the material as if he was breathing too hard. The whole room was dark, his look was bizarre. But the most bizarre of all, is that the house was empty for more than 5 years. The Costas had died long ago, there should be no one inside. 

That’s when everything went black.
