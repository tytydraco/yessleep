This all started a bit over a year ago, when Woody and Zeke (Woodrow Wayne and Ezekiel Caine&mdash;family names) were not quite two years old.  It took me until this week to gather all the pieces of the story and put them in sequence.  I'll try to tell it as it happened, rather than as I learned the different bits.

Pete (I'll use the last name Smith, to protect all of us) was picking up his boys from a home-operated daycare, run by a lady named Sandra, in July 2022, a miserable hot afternoon.  He parked his car at the curb on the residential street, facing the wrong way&mdash;technically illegal, but common around here.  To keep it cool, he left the engine running while he went inside for the twins.  He set Zeke and Woody in their child seats on the back bench seat, and was leaned in buckling up Woody when the front end of his car was rammed by a light pickup truck at street speed.  The pickup driver was on his phone and didn't notice *a bright blue car with its doors open!*

The driver staggered out, saw the two kids sprawled in the car, and called 911 instantly.  He didn't see Pete at first, because the rearward impact had thrown Pete between the front seats to land head-down in the passenger floor&mdash;then a beach towel flung from the back seat landed over him.

So the first ambulance found two toddler boys "alone" in a car, with no adult.  Neither seemed badly hurt, but the EMTs didn't hesitate&mdash;they put them on backboards and took them straight to the ER, even before the first police car arrived.  The twins were registered as John and James Doe, with temporary medical record numbers; the admission report (I've seen it) said "MV accident, no seatbelts."  That was Strike 1.

Pete's engine, amazingly, was still running, though the radiator was shredded and oil was spilling out.  A cop reached the scene just in time to hear the engine seize up and stop.  He noticed that, then heard noise from inside the car.  Pete had been stunned by the impact, but now, banged around but mostly conscious, was struggling his way out from under the towel.  The cop called another ambulance, but tried to take Pete's statement on the scene.

Pete hardly knew where he was; his only concern was for the twins.  The cop hadn't seen the boys, and didn't even know they'd been there.  The pickup driver, after seeing two toddlers hauled off in an ambulance, had decided to lawyer up and not admit anything.  The cop heard Pete asking about his boys, looked at the empty car, and made a note wondering if Pete was stoned or delusional.  Strike 2.

The cop also, having heard the car's engine running, concluded Pete had been *driving* when struck&mdash;possibly on the wrong side of the street.  Only the pickup driver's unwillingness to make any statement at all kept the cop from citing Pete on the spot.

As Pete told me later, the cop kept asking him what led up to the accident.  "I told him I was putting the boys in their car seats.  He kept asking me, 'That's the last thing you remember?' like he didn't believe it, and I kept telling him, 'That's the last thing that *happened!*"  The cop was convinced Pete was *driving,* and either trauma had temporarily affected his memory&mdash;or he was deliberately denying knowing what happened.  He made a note of his suspicions.  He also saw that the driver's airbag hadn't deployed (because Pete wasn't in the driver's seat); he noted that as well.

By now the second ambulance had finally arrived&mdash;some event downtown, with people getting heatstroke, had ambulance service backed up&mdash;and was waiting to take Pete to the ER, so the cop let him go.  Pete, who really *didn't* know how he got from buckling Woody to wadded beneath terrycloth seashells, was still too confused to just point at the daycare house and say, "Go ask in there!"  Amazingly, Sandra, the daycare lady, didn't hear the crash or see the activity on the street; Woody and Zeke were her last kids that afternoon.

The cop stayed on the scene until the tow truck arrived.  The pickup driver volunteered for a breath test, which he passed.  Nobody noticed Pete's cell phone under the front passenger seat.  The cop still wasn't sure who was at fault but, on reflection, decided to cite Pete for not having his children belted in.  Strike 3.

When Pete got to the hospital (where his admission report also was marked "MVA, no seatbelt"&mdash;Strike 4), he at last learned the twins reached the ER an hour before him, were admitted as Does, and were already seen and pronounced relatively unhurt.  But when the ER staff kept him from joining the boys, *because he wasn't carrying proof he was their father,* he lost his shit for a few minutes.  Security was called, and threatened to have him arrested.

Somebody cool-headed finally got Pete to confirm his car license, which had made it from the first EMTs' notes to the ER chart.  But a note went into Pete's record:  "Patient extremely agitated and unreasonable."  Strike 5.  (Look, this isn't baseball.)  When Pete calmed down, he finally thought to have them call Jean, his wife.  (He only now missed his phone.)  He gave them her number, but they only got voicemail&mdash;Jean was on the phone trying to find *him.*

Pete gave the ER staff Woody and Zeke's personal information, but because they were in an exam room instead of at the admitting desk it was written down by a nurse, not entered directly into the computer.  He gave their first names, middle initials, and date of birth but couldn't remember their Social Security numbers.  "I told them, 'They were born here.  They'll be in your computer.'"  The nurse noted that on the chart for whoever updated the records later&mdash;the "in your computer" part, not the "born here" part.

My sister-in-law Jean had discovered Pete wasn't answering his phone.  She called the daycare to find out why Pete and the boys weren't home yet.  Sandra looked out, saw a tow truck just driving off with Pete's smashed car, and treated Jean to some over-the-phone hysterics.  Jean called the cops, got passed to the ambulance service, then directed to the hospital.  She arrived just in time to take charge of the twins while Pete was, at last, getting seen by a doctor.

Meanwhile, the admissions desk was entering the twins' data from the written notes.  The computer had an option&mdash;probably for accidents&mdash;to copy information from one patient to another, so the clerk copied address and family information from Zeke to Woody.  But the computer wouldn't let her copy the date of birth (which seems sensible now; it was surely designed for family members but not twins).  She entered Woody's date of birth from memory&mdash;but swapped the month and day.  So Zeke was entered as 08/09/2020, but Woody was entered as 09/08/2020.

She noticed the notation "no seatbelts" in the admission.  After some hesitation, she checked a flag that said "Suspected child abuse or neglect".

Then the clerk noticed the "already in the computer" note.  She was new enough she didn't know how to merge these newly-created records into existing records, so she asked a more experienced clerk to help.  The first clerk turned to a new arrival in the ER, and the older clerk took over.  She'd just arrived for the evening shift, hadn't seen the twins admitted, had no idea they were toddlers.

Without SSNs, she did a name search:  "Ezekiel C Smith".  Because she already had one patient record on screen, and was searching for another one to merge it into, the computer system only showed her one name at a time.  The first one that came up was *not* Zeke&mdash;but looked like it was.

By one of those coincidences that's less of one when you know the story, she found Ezekiel *Caleb* Smith, born August 9, 1920&mdash;Zeke's great-great-grandfather and namesake, born exactly a century before my nephew.  When the twins were born on Ezekiel's centennial, it seemed only natural to name one of them after him; after that, it was easy to name the other after Ezekiel's younger brother.

(This is maybe the only part of this story that's even partly Pete's fault.  If he'd given the nurse each boy's middle name, Caine and Wayne, instead of just the initials, maybe the clerk wouldn't have done what she did.)

The clerk saw that date of birth, saw "08/09/2020" entered on the new record, and decided that the new clerk had entered the year incorrectly.  She merged Zeke's admission record into his great-great-grandfather's record.  (I spoke to her a few months ago.  She didn't question the patient being 102 years old; to her, that just made an ER admission unsurprising.)

Similarly, a search for "Woodrow W Smith" pulled up Ezekiel's kid brother&mdash;and this is the real coincidence, because Woodrow Wilson Smith was born *September 8th, 1922,* exactly 98 years before the incorrect birthdate entered for Woody!  The clerk, a bit aggravated at finding *two* "errors" in this birthdate, merged Woody's admission into his great-great-great-uncle's record.

Pete's exam went fairly quickly.  "The ER doctor was nice," he told me, "but kinda distracted.  She didn't want to hear anything besides 'car wreck.'  She just checked me over, gave me a scrip for half a dozen hydrocodone, and she was off to the next guy."  But another woman, who Pete said called herself "your case manager," had questions to make up for the doctor's lack.

I've dealt with hospital staff who'd bend over backward to get patients the best possible care, but this "case manager" seemed to have only two goals:  to get Pete out of the ER as quickly as possible, and to make it easy for his health insurance to deny him coverage.

She was the only staffer Pete saw using a handheld tablet instead of written notes; apparently it linked directly to the hospital computer&mdash;which by now had Zeke and Woody merged with their 20th-century ancestors.  She could open more than one patient record at a time, but the screen would only *show* one at a time, making it difficult to cross-reference them.

She saw that Pete's admission notes showed he was picking up Zeke and Woody from "daycare"; she didn't have the location of the accident, and assumed the two "old men" were in some sort of assisted living.  She noted that none of the three accident victims were wearing seatbelts.  "I have to report that, you know," she told Pete.  He told her he was just putting the boys in the car, that he hadn't started driving yet, but she ignored that to ask another question.  "The ambulance notes say that your airbag didn't deploy in the accident.  Had you manually disabled it?"

"What?" Pete asked.  "Why would you ask that?"  It wasn't until much later he understood her question.  At the time, she simply changed the subject.

"You were helping Woodrow and Ezekiel into the car, you said."

"Last I remember, I was buckling Woody in."

"Buckling him in?  Can't he buckle himself?"  Remember, her tablet said Woody was an adult.

"He's not strong enough.  They make the buckles in those little seats extra stiff on purpose, so only the parents can open them."

"Little seats?  Have you got a special seat for him?"

"What kind of parent do you think I am?  Anyway, federal law requires it, as you oughta know.  Safety seats for both my boys."

"Safety seats?"  I can kind of understand how her brain gears must have been grinding at this point.  *Parents?  My boys?  Federal law requires safety seats for old folks?*  She made a note on the tablet:  "Possible paranoid delusions; rec. psych eval".  Strike 6.

"Yeah, Zeke fights me when I put him in it, but I don't take chances with my boys."  *Zeke fights me?*  Now, distinctly alarmed, she tapped an inconspicuous box on the tablet screen, one that checked a flag on the computer:  "Suspected elder abuse or neglect".  *Strike 99.*

She terminated the interview rather abruptly at that point; Pete didn't particularly notice because Jean was coming in with the boys, having completed some insurance foofaraw at the admissions desk.  Jean took her three shaken men home, with a brief side trip to the pharmacy.
****
The next phase started a few days later, apparently when Pete's health insurance received the claims filed by the hospital and ambulance service.  At first the case must have looked reasonable:  Three people injured in an auto accident, treated and released.  Then they looked deeper, starting with the police accident report.

"No seatbelts".  Since Pete said he hadn't seen the pickup at all, the driver had decided to claim Pete was driving on the wrong side, weaving between lanes; the report showed that.  The report had the officer's concern that Pete might be faking a lack of recall.

So the insurance company requested a dump of the full chart for Pete, Woody, and Zeke.  The insurance billing was just a list of charges, without anything about child or elder abuse, but Pete's chart had all the notes.  Confusingly (to the insurance company), the only data available on the boys was from the accident.  Woodrow and Ezekiel had both been in the computer system, but Woodrow's last admission was in 2003, and Ezekiel's was in 1998; their charts had long since been archived.

The hospital was doing its own investigation.  Their social services office was understaffed, but had at last gotten around to looking at those "suspected abuse or neglect" flags.  It confused the supervisor that "child" and "elder" were both checked, but she followed procedure and submitted reports to the Arkansas State Police.

The insurance company, faced with elderly patients, suspected abuse, and a lack of clear records, requested data from a variety of sources.  I don't know who it was&mdash;the Social Security Administration, maybe&mdash;but *somebody* told them the awful truth:  Woodrow Smith had died in 2011 at the age of 90, and Ezekiel Smith had died in 1999 at 79!

So now they had an insurance fraud case&mdash;so they thought.  They turned over everything they had to the FBI.  They also informed the hospital that two of the three patients they'd filed claims on were long deceased, and that the claims were apparently fraudulent.

Nobody at the hospital could figure out what was going on.  Computer records said two elderly patients had been seen, but the ER exam notes said "age uncertain, approx 2yo".  Some resident noted that Pete wasn't wearing a seatbelt and that the "case manager" suspected he'd disabled his airbag, combined that with the apparent belief that he'd been chauffering two dead men in his back seat, and concluded that Pete was both delusional and suicidal.  He convinced someone in hospital administration to petition the circuit court for an involuntary commitment with "immediate detention"&mdash;meaning Pete would be picked up and held for up to 72 hours.

None of us knew anything about this.  I'm still not sure just which agency contacted the city cops, but it was three weeks after the accident when they showed up at Pete and Jean's door, wanting to ask him a few questions.  Pete was driving to Fayetteville for a meeting.  Jean, totally bewildered, explained what she knew about the accident, and introduced the twins to the two officers, who she said were utterly charmed by the boys.

But the tenor of some of their questions alarmed her.  Did she ever feel threatened, or feel frightened for the twins?  Was it true Pete had changed jobs three times in five years?  (Nothing on Pete: two companies went broke; a third moved to Atlanta.)

She called Pete out of his meeting.  Pete called the hospital and requested all his records and the twins'.  Pete then called me, asking if I'd pick up the copies of records when ready.  "I'll stop by your office on my way back through town.  Thanks, Becca."

I expected a sealed envelope; the hospital just shoved a folder of copies at me.  I couldn't resist peeking.  Soon I was sitting in the parking lot at my office, flipping sheets back and forth in perplexity.  What on earth had the hospital done to the twins' records?  Born in 1920?  And Woody's SSN started with 353-13, but Zeke's started with 943-53.  SSNs couldn't start with 9, I knew.  (Yeah, there are numbers that start with 9, but they're special cases.)

Pete showed up at my office a little before quitting time.  I pointed out the weird errors in Woody and Zeke's personal information.  He gaped at the dates of birth, tapped the SSNs.  Then he started laughing.  "How the hell did they do that?"

He explained to me how the hospital had mixed Zeke and Woody's information with their great-ancestors.  Then the laughter went out of him, and he said words I hadn't heard him use since the twins were born.  "No wonder the insurance company's been stalling.  I'm going to tear somebody at that hospital a new one if they don't get this straightened out fast."

He shook his head, forced a grin, and thanked me for picking up the copies.  "Now I know what the problem is, we'll get this crap straightened out."

But it was already too late.
****
He hung around another ten minutes until I got off; we walked to the parking lot together.  We chatted for a minute by my car, then he walked to the new car he'd bought.  Just as he unlocked the door, a voice bellowed, "Police!"  Pete froze, except for swiveling his head to see who was yelling.  I spotted a uniformed officer to my left, hand on his holstered gun, and cried out.  I don't know if that's what started it.

The officer whirled toward me, drawing his gun.  Somebody yelled from my right, and the officer twisted and snapped a shot in that direction.  Pete hit the pavement a moment later.  Someone shot from my right, and the uniformed man dropped.  Now more gunshots were coming from somewhere else, and the officer was firing from ground level.  I shrieked, but the sound was lost in the echoes.  Pete's rear window shattered.

I did something completely irrational.  I jumped in my car, started it, and *drove straight toward Pete.*  The side window behind me turned into gravel; I didn't hear the bullet hit.  I got my car between Pete and the shooters to the left; crouching, he unlocked his door and scrambled inside.  In a few moments, we were racing side by side toward the parking lot exit, while a battle apparently went on behind us.  Neither of our cars was hit after we started moving.

We only drove a few blocks, turning this way and that, before Pete led me into the mall parking lot.  He got out and came to my car, but instead of speaking he stood and listened.  After a minute or two he said, "No sirens."

Blocks back I'd realized what a suicidally dangerous thing I'd done, and now I was shaking like a leaf.  Pete said, "Come to our house; we'll talk about this with Jean."  When my hands stopped quivering, I pulled out behind him again.

But when we reached their house, there were two dark sedans and a police SUV parked in front of it.  He rolled by the end of the block without turning.  I followed, hoping nobody could see my busted-out window at that distance.  I was trailing about half a block behind him.

I was about to pull past him, so I could find a place for us to pull over again, when suddenly a white sedan whipped out to block the street.  He stopped, but before he could back up a gray sedan pulled across his rear.  A man stepped out of each one; both wore beards and carried handguns.  I heard shouting; to my shock I recognized Russian.

Again I acted against my own safety.  They hadn't even looked my way.  I floored the gas, and simply drove under the man from the gray car.  He rolled off my windshield into the back of Pete's car; his head and chest went through the shot-out rear window.  The other man tried to jump back in the white car; I pinned him between the driver's door and my bumper.

Pete jumped out of his car, yelling my name.  I nearly ran him down backing away from the second Russian, who collapsed into the street.  Pete picked up the handgun the man had dropped, then checked him for a wallet.  The man stirred as Pete searched his pockets, but seemed only half-conscious.

"No ID," Pete told me.  "Lots of cash.  A damn Colt 1911.  A phone, maybe a burner."  He walked around my car to check the other man's pockets and collect the other pistol.  "They're both still alive," he told me.  "But you'd better get out of here.  I don't know what's going on, but I'm not waiting around."  He walked back to the gray car, climbed into it, and drove away, turning onto a side street at the end of the block.  I didn't see him again for over half a year.

I stared at the two fallen Russians, wondering if I should call 911 or just run away.  I dithered just a bit too long&mdash;suddenly there were flashing lights from unmarked cars around me.
****
I spent a day and a half in a little apartment somewhere in Fort Smith, being questioned by two FBI agents, a man and a woman.  An older man sometimes listened in; he never showed any ID.  I think now he might have been CIA.  He was bald but for a rim of white hair around his head; since he never gave a name I thought of him as the Monk.  The FBI seemed to accept at last that I had no idea what was going on, but wouldn't answer any of my questions.  When I thought they were going to let me go, instead they handed me to the State Police.

The troopers at least gave me some information.  They were investigating allegations of child neglect and elder abuse.  Now Pete was also wanted for fleeing arrest.  The shootout in the parking lot was a "balls-up" due to lack of coordination.  The city police had been sent to take Pete in for an involuntary commitment; the FBI had arrived to question Pete, having traced his cell phone to my office.  The uniformed officer I'd seen first had seen an armed man approaching, an FBI agent, and fired a panic shot, triggering an exchange.

The State Police didn't know what had happened to the two Russians I'd hit; they thought the FBI had custody of them.  The city cops, who got their turn next, didn't even know about the Russians.  They told me my car had been impounded by the State Police, who hadn't mentioned that detail.  The city cops wanted to know why my brother was suicidal, and made me talk to a police shrink for hours about him.

In the end, nobody seemed to think I'd known anything I shouldn't.  Several people from various agencies said ominous things about aiding a fugitive, but nobody actually wanted to arrest me.  Unfortunately, none of them seemed to believe my explanations of the confusion surrounding Pete and the twins.  After three days, they were going to let me go&mdash;an hour's drive from home without a car.

That's when the Monk, the one who never showed ID, came back.  He still didn't give a name or agency.  But he did answer two of my questions:  The two Russians were alive but in FBI custody; "Bad guys," he said, grinning darkly.  And various agencies still wanted to arrest Pete for unclear reasons.

The Monk gave me one hint.  "Woodrow Wilson Smith was the code name for a deep-cover Soviet agent," he said.  "We've been watching for that name since the 1970s.  Somehow your brother activated him."

"Pete wasn't even born until 1993!"

"Names like that get handed down over the years.  But when your brother had his little 'accident,' that code name hit the wires.  Now we're seeing odd activity on both sides of the former Iron Curtain, and a Russian satellite that's been believed inactive since 2002 is suddenly shifting its orbit; it's passing over Ukraine four times as often as it used to."  He gave me that dark grin again.  "If you hear from your brother, tell him to contact the FBI.  If he comes in voluntarily, he might stay out of federal prison.  And the FBI might be able to protect him from Putin's KGB."

That was all I got.  Jean came to Fort Smith to get me; they'd given her an even harder time, until they'd decided Pete had kept her ignorant.  They'd half-convinced her Pete really was up to something, but she was shaking that off.

For months we didn't hear anything.  I kept a confident attitude for Jean, but I expected daily to hear that Pete's body had been found somewhere, riddled with bullets.

On my birthday in January, a courier brought a box of flowers to my office.  People stopped by all day, making jokes about my secret admirer.  I didn't tell any of them about the cheap cell phone I found in the box, or the contact entry with company name "Tuesdays 19:00-19:10" but no phone number.

Every week I turned that phone on for ten minutes, always somewhere away from home.  Three times from January to March I got text messages, always just a simple "?".  The FBI and State Police were still checking on me from time to time, so each time I simply replied, "They're still hunting."

I spent those months piecing together what I've already told:  interviewing the hospital staff, talking to the cop who made the first accident report, pestering the clerk of the circuit court judge who signed the commitment order.  I explained to the cop how Pete had literally been parked in front of his sons' daycare when he was hit; I managed to at least get that accident report amended.  The pickup driver was cited for the accident and was lucky not to get charged with making a false statement.

Then one Tuesday evening last May I turned on the mystery phone in a movie theater restroom and got a real message:  a map pin and "16:30 Thursday bring charts".  I didn't know if anyone knew to track this phone, but I couldn't pass up a chance to meet Pete.

I argued with myself for two days about whether to tell Jean, and whether to tell the FBI.  I did neither.  I told my boss I needed to leave early Thursday, and made the hour drive to Fort Smith.

I drove to Ben Geren Park on the east side of the city, to a parking lot behind the golf course.  There was Pete, looking thin, needing a haircut.  He still drove the same gray car he'd stolen from the Russians; he'd somehow gotten a new license plate.  He waved and mouthed, *Follow me,* then led me to a different parking lot on the east side.

I knew that by "bring charts" he'd meant the hospital medical records.  He wanted to see the incorrect data for the twins again.  "I looked up the real Social Security numbers for Great-Grandpa and Uncle Woodrow, and I wanted to check them against these."  He looked at the charts.  "I think Uncle Woodrow's is right, but I know Great-Grandpa's is wrong."

"I told you a Social can't start with 9.  Maybe the Russians had something to do with it."

He started to punch the numbers into his phone.  "Why don't you just take a picture?"  I was uneasy about spending time in the open.

"Camera doesn't work.  It's a phone I stole off one of the Russians.  I have to text everything to myself if I want to keep it."

I was about to make some nervous crack about Russian quality when I saw cars rolling down the road&mdash;too many cars, too ordinary looking.  Then I saw doors opening on a van parked nearby.  Then people just seemed to appear from everywhere.

I saw the two FBI agents who'd interviewed me, leading a team.  I saw state troopers in uniform.  I saw two Fort Smith police officers.  And I saw three men with beards.  There were enemies on every side of us.

"Pete!" I squeaked, my voice tight in panic.  He looked up from his phone and went pale.  He yanked at the door of his car, looked at the cars clogging the narrow road, and turned toward the bike trail into the woods instead.

That's when the Monk appeared, tearing down the trail on a mountain bike, his white hair flying.  "Hide!" he bellowed.  "Get in your car!"  He waved one arm frantically, gesturing to the sides, to anywhere but where we were.

Pete froze, unable to pick a direction.  Cops and agents closed in from all sides; I saw one of the Russians pull out what looked like a grenade.  "In your car!" the Monk shouted again.  "Everybody under cover!"

"Come on!" I yelled, and ran straight toward the Monk on his bike.  But Pete still stood petrified.  I stopped, unwilling to leave him.

His face took on a pained expression.  His mouth opened wide as if he was stretching his jaw.  Suddenly his eyes bulged.  Hair on top of his head caught fire.  He swayed a bit, dropped to his knees.  Then, with surprisingly little noise, the top of his skull burst open in a spray of blood and brain.

The Monk locked his brakes and screeched to a stop just past me. He gaped at Pete's body, then at me.  "Why didn't he move?"

"What happened?  Did somebody shoot him?"

"It was that Russian satellite I told you about.  It's got a maser, a forty-thousand watt microwave laser.  It shot him with microwaves from orbit.  It boiled his brain."  I gaped at him.  "We got word two days ago that the satellite had shifted orbit again.  I got word just a minute ago that it was coming overhead, and scans said the laser was arming."  He waved at my car and the stolen gray sedan.  "The metal roof would have protected you."

I remembered the soft noise, and how Pete's skull had popped.  I must have been deep in shock to say what I did.  "It looked like popping a zit," I told the Monk.

He turned and threw up on his shoe.

I picked up the phone Pete had dropped.  By some freak, not a speck of blood or brain had touched it.  "Don't move!" some cop or other yelled at me.

The two SSNs were still on the screen.  Ignoring the cops circling us, I showed them to the Monk, still spitting and wiping his mouth.  "Look at these numbers," I said.  He looked.  He swore in at least two languages.
****
That was the end.  The FBI team took over, pushing the state and city cops back from me, the Monk, and Pete's body.  The Russians quietly got back in their van and drove off while everyone else was distracted.

The Monk had seen numbers like Great-Grandpa's fake SSN before, it turned out; the KGB had used numbers starting with 9 as code, embedded in computer data all over the country&mdash;insurance files, hospital records, bank records.  Accessing Woodrow Wilson Smith's name hadn't been the sleeper activation code; sending his SSN through insurance records had been.  My brother Pete just got in the way.

I still didn't know, though&mdash;neither did the Monk&mdash;how on earth they'd aimed a laser from outer space to hit him in a random parking lot.  I just learned that this week.

I wanted to leave some kind of marker on the spot where Pete was killed. Nothing obtrusive like bouquets of flowers; just something like a small metal cap in the pavement.  I wanted to show it to Zeke and Woody for their third birthday; they're still confused about what happened to their dad.

This week I got on Google Maps, wanting to pin a spot I could send to Jean to show her where to take the boys.  I zoomed in as close as I could, and dropped a pin in the spot I remembered.  The GPS coordinates came up on the screen, something I'd forgotten Maps would do.

The numbers looked familiar.  Had I dropped a pin here before?  The coordinates, rounded a bit, were 35.313,-94.353.

Then my mind kind of blinked.  The decimal shifted to the right, turned into a hyphen.  Another hyphen appeared two digits further on.

And I had the answer, the final, most outrageous coincidence of all.  I passed my idea through the FBI, and the Monk was kind enough to send confirmation back.  The Russian phone Pete had stolen had an app on it, *an app that controlled the Russian laser satellite.*  Pete had typed the two Social Security numbers, one real, one bogus, from his sons' hospital records into the phone; the satellite had converted them to GPS coordinates, automatically adding a minus to the longitude for positioning in the western hemisphere.

Those coordinates struck right into Ben Geren Park.  With his sons' medical records, Pete had used the stolen Russian phone to call a space laser strike onto his own head.
