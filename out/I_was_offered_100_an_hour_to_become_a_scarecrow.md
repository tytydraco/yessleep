I have a strange relationship with drugs. When I was a kid, nothing terrified me more than the man who lived in the stairwell of our block of flats. I'd walk past him at least twice a day. He was barely lucid, he'd only ever speak in disjointed gibberish, but he would always try to talk to me. Sometimes he'd lurch towards me and send me running back to my family's apartment. One day, I found him dead. He was curled up in his bed of bin bags and cardboard, unmoving and silent. I'm sure I wasn't the first to see him, but I was the first to care. He stayed there for another day before people eventually arrived to take his body away. 

I know now that man was a heroin addict. Since I left home at 16, I've seen plenty of them. For a while, I was one. It took months, years of relying on a carefully knitted support group of friends and family for me to get clean. I'm doing better now. I'm sharing an apartment with two of my closest friends. It isn't ideal living, but I couldn't imagine it any other way. I've been looking into getting to do my A-Levels. I like to think that I'm a smart enough guy. The only thing stopping me are the exam fees. 

Until then, I'm stuck with low skill part-time work. I worked at the local kebab take-out in the building next door to us, until I made a joke to the owner who didn't find it nearly as funny as I did. Since then, I've been bouncing around from place to place, delivering food on a bike or picking gum off of public benches. I earn enough money to scrape by with little room for much else. 

Until now. 

I've known Roger since we were kids. We grew up in the same apartment tower and when I went to school, we'd usually bump into each other there. I hadn't spoken to him in ages, until we happened to volunteer for the same youth reach group. We kept in touch since then, and he's spent more nights than I can count crashing on our sofa. He was a good guy Roger was, so when he came to me with the so-called “offer of a lifetime”, I had to listen. 

He came over to our apartment at noon the next day. My flatmates were both out. Toby was visiting his parents in Plymouth and Meat, who you shouldn't question the nickname of, was working the morning shift at a local laundrette. We exchanged pleasantries, I made him a mug of tea, and we sat down to chat. 

“So here I was, strapped for cash.” Roger began, “Thumbing through the classifieds, looking for something to see me through until spring. Then it jumped out at me. Print so small I barely noticed it.”

He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a tiny scrap of paper. He handed it to me with a grin and I squinted to read it. 

WNTD: Scarecrow. £100/hr. Stand still, scare birds. Uniform provided. Field’s cold, no wimps. Call 555-2769.

Before I could reply, Roger piped up. 

“I thought it was a gag at first”, he said, “sure looked like one. I decided to ring the number and see if it patched me through to Worzel Gummidge. I was damn surprised when someone actually answered.”

I sat back and sipped my tea, not wanting to interrupt Roger. 

“So this man says his name is Colin. Says the ad wasn't a piss take and that he's ready and willing to pay the stated amount. I still don't believe the guy of course, but we exchange emails and leave it at that. A few days go by and I remember him. I decided to send an email, just to see how far he's taking the joke. Turns out, very fuckin’ far.”

I chuckle and let him continue. He has my attention in a choke hold. 

“Three days later, I'm on the train east. I had an address and a convincing enough story and that's all I need. I ended up in the middle of nowhere. Real twelve-toe country. I had to ask this bus driver for directions and he offered to take me right to him! I love rural bus drivers. Not that he took me right to him per say, it was still a two mile walk from where he dropped me off, but it's better than the usual two fingers you'd get in Ipswich.”

“So was he legit?” I interjected as Roger began to ramble about the state of the public transport system. 

“He was indeed” Roger told me as he got back on track. “I came up to this old, dilapidated, redbrick farmhouse. The man, Colin, came out of his shed to greet me. He was exactly how I imagined. Real old ways type of guy. Barrel-shaped. Probably voted BNP. Lovely fella though, just lovely. Anyway, he showed me around and explained to me properly, for the first time, what I'd actually be doing.”

I couldn't believe what Roger said next. All I could think of while he explained it to me was the pay. £600 for one shift. It sounded too good to be true, but Roger assured me it wasn't.

“All of this was last year”, continued Roger, “when the corn was in season. I finished my week, got almost five grand cash in-hand and bid Colin a fond farewell. I hadn't heard from him since, until a few days ago. He offered me the same position. I turned it down, I've pinned down a much more stable job since then, but I told him I'd find someone. You were the first person who came to mind.”

Two days later I was on the train east.  

The job sounded bizarre, but I trusted Roger. He was a good man. A better man than me. I had instant ramen for dinner outside of a modern cafe garishly tacked on to a 19th century redbrick train station. I had to purge the taste of artificial shrimp from my palate by downing a full packet of apple flavoured gum. By the time I found the address, I was hungry again. I'd been walking up a dirt road, which ended up being his extended driveway, for what felt like an hour. Finally, the old farmhouse appeared on the horizon. I passed the guesthouse that'll serve as my accommodation for the week and walked up to the front door. I pounded the ram-shaped metal knocker into the green-painted wood. 

It creaked open slowly, and then swung open. The man who could only be Colin greeted me with a vigorous handshake. 

“You must be Roger's friend!” He exclaimed as I stepped inside. “Come in, come in. Can I get you anything?”

“Just a cup of tea” I replied. 

“You've come down from the city, I heard. You must be famished!”

“Some food would go amiss,” I admitted. 

The evening was spent getting to know Colin. He was a nice enough guy. His wife Muriel had passed away in 2017. Since then it's just been him and his countless dogs looking after the farm. He served me a bowl of his family recipe stew. I lied and told him it was delicious, trying to be polite. 

Night soon came and Colin asked me if I was ready. I told him “I am”. 

We left the comfort of the farmhouse then and I followed him out to the shed. He turned on a small, naked bulb on which lit the cavernous room. The walls were lined with dozens of tools. Metal boxes of screws and nails were stacked high. My dad would've loved it. 
Colin showed me the workbench. There was something resting on top of it, draped in a white sheet. With a showman's flourish, Colin pulled back the sheet. Laying on the table was my new uniform. 

It was a modified brown leather duster coat, just like the one Roger told me about. 

“Want to try it on?” Asked Colin with a wink. 

“Sure." I replied, meekly. 

I lifted it up. It was unsurprisingly heavy. I threw it on and found that the sleeves hung down to below my knees. It was like a straight jacket. It had rows of leather straps and belts covering it. The pockets had been stuffed with straw and sewn shut, but bits of it poked from the worn patches. I saw in the dirt covered mirror propped up behind me that the symbol of a scythe had been stained into the back of the jacket. 

“Perfect fit, as always” said Colin with a nod and a wink. 

I smiled weekly as Colin led me out of the shed and towards the corn. He turned to me, making sure I was keeping up with him. 

“Fine work this is” he told me. “Dates back centuries so it does. Millennium. This isn't the best part of the country to grow corn for no reason”. 

He sniffed and wiped his nose on the back of his sleeve. There was corn either side of us now, stalks well over seven feet tall. A path had been forged through the crops, deep into the field. Before long, we came to a crossroads of sorts. The two dirt trails snaking through the fields converged here, creating an “X” shape. Standing tall in the center of this clearing as a towering, wooden cross. It had a small plastic step ladder at its base and I knew instantly what it was for. 

“This is where you'll be for the night”, said Colin, his first words in some time.

“So, do I just-” I began, but Colin cut me off. 

“Just stand on that step, arms out, there's a good lad.”

I did as I was told. Colin moved around me, grabbing the dangling belts and straps above him and fastening them tight. It wasn't exactly comfortable, but nothing I could manage for a few hours. Once he finished making sure I could budge he stood in front of me again. With a smirk, he kicked the plastic step out from under me. I expected to lose my footing, to fall, but to my surprise I didn't. I stayed perfectly in the same position, hanging from the post like a scarecrow. I guess that's what I was.

“Not too tight I hope” said Colin, almost to himself. 

“No… no they're OK. I replied, earnestly. 

Colin’s watch beeped. He looked down at it and then glanced up at me. 

“Your shift starts now. I'll be back at six to let you down. Good luck.” 

With that, Colin turned and walked away back down the path. I called his name repeatedly, but my pleading fell on deaf ears. Slowly, Colin’s figure became a silhouette, then an outline, then nothing. He was gone, and I was alone. The first thing I noticed was the itch on my nose. I instinctively tried to move my hand to it, but it was forced down by the straps. I then tried to wiggle my nose in such a way that it'd give me some relief. It didn't work. This was going to be a long night. 

I was elevated to the point where I could see the top of the corn stalks. There was a dull green expanse stretching out on either side of me. The Moon was a few days off being full, but it gave me enough light to see just in front of me. I started to whistle to myself, then began to sing. When I forgot all the lyrics in my head, I looked up and attempted to name as many constellations as I could. 

I guessed that an hour had passed by now. But without a watch, it could've been half an hour, or maybe it was two. Who knows? I smiled to myself, thinking that I now had at least £100 in my pocket. 

I almost didn't hear it through my yawn. 

Quickly, I silenced myself and listened. I could've sworn I heard something. A rustling, different from the gentle swaying of the stalks in the wind that had accompanied me since my shift began. I didn't dare make a noise. I listened closely and heard it again. There was something moving through the stalks, and it was getting closer.

I writhed around in my constraints, trying desperately to see what was coming for me. I turned my head as far around as I could, bending my neck unnaturally. Still, I couldn't see what it was. The noise has grown even closer now. Accompanying it was the sound of something dragging in the dirt. 

I winced as silence returned. I couldn't bring myself to open my eyes. My mouth was shut and my breathing was low. Eventually, I found enough courage to look. There was nothing. I breathed a sigh of relief and began to rationalise things to myself. 

Then it growled. 

It was a few inches from me, standing directly behind the post. I could feel its moist breath on the back of my neck. If its head, whatever it was, was at the same level as mine, then it would've been nine feet tall. Suddenly, its growl turned into a low whimper and it scurried off into the fields of corn. Gradually, the sound of it crashing through the husks died down, and I was left in silence again. 

I spent the next of what I could only guess was an hour reeling from what had just happened. I screamed for Colin to come get me, but it was useless. It was a ten minute walk from the farmhouse to this part of the field. Even if my pleas did make it that far, I'm sure Colin would be fast asleep. 

I'd just finished another bout of screaming when I saw a figure in the mist directly ahead of me. I squinted and realised it must be Colin, not wanting to think of the alternative. The figure drew closer and soon, he was standing directly in front of me. It wasn't Colin. 

In the dim light of the moon, I could only see his face once he was right before me. He had a gnarled, hunched back, covered in a dark blue cloak. He held two perfectly thin wooden sticks, as tall as he was, in each hand. His face was half shrouded in a long, coned hood. The part of it I could see was infested with wrinkles and crawling with snails. He had a hooked nose and three teeth. He smiled as he spoke. 

“Why hello there young man. Could you point me in the direction of Hemsby?” He said in an oppressively thick Buckinghamshire accent. 

I blinked dumbly in pure confusion. 

“Who… who are you?” I managed to stutter out. 

“I am the Dodman”, he replied, saying it as if it was the most obvious thing imaginable. 

I didn't know what to say. We just stared at each other until the Dodman spoke again. 

“Please, do you know of the port town of Hemsby?” he said, in more of a growl now. 

“Yes” I forced myself to say. 

“Pleasant”, replied the Dodman, “Could you send me in its direction?”

I tried to point behind me by shaking my head. The Dodman seemed to understand me perfectly fine. 

“Thank you young man”, he said “You've been most helpful.”

With that, the Dodman grinned, letting his long, blackened tongue flow out of his jaw like a snake. He took his hand away from the walking stick and reached into the back of his throat. He pulled out a snail which he then placed on my cheek. He nodded his thanks at me and grabbed his sticks again, plodding them into the ground methodically as he moved behind me and walked away, further into the endless fields. 

I shook my head until my brain rang like a bell. I couldn't get that damn snail off of me. It crawled down my cheek, onto my neck and then across my back, leaving a putrid slime trail behind it. I didn't care about the money anymore, I just wanted to be let down. 

Time dripped like wax. I began laughing hysterically to myself at the thought that it could have only been ten minutes since I started the shift. I'd been trying to keep track of things by following the moon's journey across the sky, but now there were nothing but dark clouds which obstructed even the brightest star. 

My throat was sore from calling for help. I was both hoping, and terrified, that someone could be within ear shot. Nothing came. I couldn't even sleep with the adrenaline, borne from pure, directionless fear, pumping through my veins. I hung my head, defeated. 

Suddenly, I noticed that I could make out more detail in the dirt floor below me. I could see each stone, each rotten, petrified shuck. Every impression made my countless wandering soles. I realised that I was being bathed in light. 

I looked up, scraping the back of my head against the wooden post. Three burning balls of blue light were hovering in the night sky directly above me, rotating slowly. They made a perfect triangle and must've been hundreds of meters off the ground. My eyebrows singed as the orbs grew brighter. I could feel the heat they emitted. They turned night to day with their blinding white light. It was like watching an atom bomb detonation. A cruel hum made my eardrums rattle and I was sure of its source. The noise hit a fever pitch as my vision turned neon. And then, nothing. 

As quickly as they appeared, they were gone. I blinked the white fuzz from my eyes but the dull tinnitus stayed. Beyond frustrated, I roared and thrashed against my constraints. I felt a brief wobble which gave me hope. I struggled even more, and began to feel myself sway. My attempt at freedom was interrupted by a naked, screaming man. 

I was so single mindedly preoccupied, I didn't hear him running manically towards me through the city of corn. He burst out from between the stalks and half tripped, half knelt in front of me. I looked down at him, more confused now than anything else. He was completely bald, not a single hair anywhere on his body. There was a medical name for that, I'm certain, but it escapes me. He was panting, clearly spent from his recent dash. When he caught his breath, he looked up at me. 

“They were coming. Now they're here. Run.” 

He said that in the voice of a boy then got unsteadily to his feet like a newborn giraffe. He was suspended there until he found his balance, then bolted off into the fields at an unnatural speed. 

I didn't waste time finding out who, or what, he was running from. I fought against my constraints like a man possessed, every splintered sound giving me hope. Finally, the post's foundations gave way. By the time I realised my mistake, it was already too late. My pedestal fell forward while I was still strapped in tight. I couldn't move my arms out in front of me, and when I hit the ground my nose shattered and the wind was knocked out of me. 

Fortunately, the impact broke away the rotten, wooden board my right arm was belted to. I reached out and took a handful of dirt and roots. I slowly began pulling myself forward. Surrounding me, hiding just beyond the stalks, was a cacophony of maddening observers. I tried to block out their chattering as I made my way forward along the dirt path, the wooden cross still strapped to me. I felt like a scene from a church's stained-glass window. 

I kept moving at a tantalising pace. In the almost pitch darkness, time meant nothing to me anymore. It sure felt like I'd been dragging myself along for hours, but it could've only been minutes. I ignored those thoughts and pathetically carried on. The glow of the farmhouse finally came into view. The post forced my head down, but in my periphery I could see the light. With renewed hope, I began to scream for Colin. 

Suddenly, a sharpened hand of claws grabbed my scalp. My screams for help turned to screams of terror as I tried to shake my assailant off. What had grabbed me jumped from my head and landed in front of me. It was a crow, small and black. It turned its head and cawed, and with my one free hand I shooed it away. 

I dragged myself over the feather it left behind itself and finally, out of the cornfield. I didn't want to attempt the journey over gravel so I just lay on my stomach and shouted for Colin. I shouted until my throat burned, and then some more. Finally, I heard the noise of someone walking towards me. I listened more closely and realised there were numerous people. Dozens. 

I looked around frantically, looking for the hidden crowd. Out from the corn emerged a group of people dressed, from where I could see, white robes. Some of them piled together to help lift me up, still attached to the scarecrow’s beam. They held me steady while one of the robe wearers, who I could now see were all wearing wicker baskets over their heads, stepped in front of me. 

He pulled off the wooden mask and held it in his hands. It was Colin. 

“You had one fucking job” he said gruffly. 

With that, he sighed and laid the mask down at his feet. The last thing I saw was him reach into his robe and pull out a wooden club, the head of which had been carved into the effigy of a ram. He lifted it over his head and brought it down on mine. 

I woke up with a headache the next day. I was in my bed in the guesthouse. The clock beside me read 12:29. There was an almost empty mug of cold, green-tinged tea on the bedside cabinet that I didn't remember drinking. My memories of last night's shift were hazy at best. So, I pulled out my laptop, opened up a fresh Google doc and began to write down everything I could recall. 

At this point though, I don't think it was anything more than a dream. When I started to write this, images of last night were burned into my mind, vibrant and real. Now? It's like I'm looking through a foggy lens. Could it have been a dream? Seemed like it. God, I can't believe I've spent the past hour writing all of this nonsense. I should probably put this laptop away and get some rest while I still can. I have a long shift coming up tonight.
