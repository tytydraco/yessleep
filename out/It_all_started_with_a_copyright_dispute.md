Last summer, a video was recommended in my YouTube feed. It grabbed my attention, so I decided to give it a watch. However, I couldn’t bring myself to finish it, as I quickly recognized it was a blatant ripoff of one of my works as an author- A story about a conceptual future society on Mars.

The next day, I began exploring that channel further, as the stolen content raked up hundreds of views overnight, which led me down a deep rabbit hole of stolen content. This stealer went by the alias, Scout, online and had been stealing my book and characters for years now, and had a unique hand-drawn avatar which I came to despise.

Scout’s most popular stolen videos were music videos and soundtracks he made for his rip-offs, each raking around 30K views each. I estimate he had made thousands off of my book, which was much more than I earned off the original content. I eventually found an older face reveal video on his channel, where he revealed he lived in China.

Damn it, Chinese rip-offs were everywhere and there was nothing creators could do about it, since America and China haven’t managed or cared to crack down on it. Now, my book was the target of Chinese rip-offs  too. I tried finding him, or any other information I could about him, but all of my searching came to a dead end.

Soon, Scout’s demeanor and goals shifted, very quickly. He had somehow obtained my iCloud account information and password, and hacked into my iPhone, and soon gained access to other accounts of mine too. He tried infiltrating my apps and tried to invade my personal notes, trying to get access to my drafts so he could steal even more content. I found my notes ransacked, and he had even written his own personal messages to me..

”Hello, I’m Scout“

”I stole your content“

”I’ve hacked into your accounts”

He even attacked some of my drafts, leaving hate and mockery, and erasing parts of what I wrote. Soon, I learned, he had allies. At the same time, I learned a teenage American boy who Scout had contacted, was ripping my content off too, although it didn’t take off as well as Scout‘s rip-off did. The boy even announced a promotional offer and sale for “chances“ to be animated as characters in his rip-off, which meant he was directly trying to profit off of my work. The boy was only one of Scout’s cronies, who were apart of their own online group, now with their ambitions set on targeting me either by ripping off my content or supporting those who did.

And no, I’m not imagining things, for anyone who is skeptical. I have before and after screenshots of what Scout did to my notes and drafts, Google and Apple showing me warnings about new login locations, and obvious reasons his content was a blatant rip-off of mine.

Back to my experience, I was began fearing for my life, as I eventually learned he knew most of my personal information including where I lived precisely. I had nightmares about him, coming to the United States, and stalking or killing me off of the screen. Of course, I changed my passwords.. but he kept coming back, with his master hacking skills! Every night, I worrisomely updated my close family members every night, about Scout’s latest exploits, and every smear and attack he tried to ensnare me in. He didn’t like competition, so he tried to get rid of me, the only obstacle in his way of getting away with all of his heinous deeds scot-free.

That was until, his efforts died down and eventually stopped out of nowhere. I frantically searched the Internet, for more information, and found his channel was no longer uploading videos, and his cronies had  abandoned him.

I found out, in his public life he was a quasi-famous poet and musician in the Indian subcontinent and China (most of his works were stolen though). I also, eventually, learned I was not the only victim- hundreds of small creators had been targeted and attacked by Scout and partially his friend group. And, some of the closer creators, were killed in real life by Scout, who also turned out to be a murderer.

Quickly, I learned, Scout had been sentenced to death and executed back in his homeland of China, mainly due to other crimes and his more severe criminal rampages. The living nightmare was finally over..

However, some of my family has speculated it may have not been him who was executed, and someone else was framed and punished for his crimes. His channel remains inactive though, so perhaps he’s in hiding if he is still out there somewhere.. My life has gotten much better, without having to worry about him anymore, although I still reminisce sometimes- like this post. But.. there’s always a doubt lingering in my mind, he might return someway, somehow.
