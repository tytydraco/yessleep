My legal name is, and has always been, Colton.

As a child, I was Backup Baby.

The concept of a backup child may be nothing new to you. Plenty of parents quite candidly admit to creating a second child to serve as a safety net—so that, should something happen to the original child, the sibling would be there to fill the void. That is already quite a hollow and horrifying motivation for bringing a human into the world.

And the purpose of my birth was far more terrible.

I was born in 2005, eighteen years after my brother, Colton—my namesake. In 2003, he had been diagnosed with Juvenile ALS, a rare form of Lou Gehrig’s disease. A sickness that degenerates one’s motor neurons until all muscles have atrophied. Until the sufferer can no longer breathe.

Despite what you may be thinking, I wasn’t created to provide spare parts for my dying brother. I have heard of parents doing such a twisted thing, but I was created to replace Colton. And not as a new person—

As a *carbon copy* of him.

Colton was their beloved son, and they sought a way of keeping him alive, in some deranged manner.

I understand why even parents as cruel as ours loved him so dearly. Colton was sweet, smart, and strong—that winning trifecta. He achieved greatness before entirely losing the motor function necessary to continue in his field, becoming a prominent medical researcher. I think he would’ve changed the world.

Tales of my brother’s greatness were ingrained into my mind from the moment I was able to form memories. Mother described Colton as a bright light that had very little time to shine on this Earth, and I agreed with her. He was so immensely compassionate, wanting only the best for me, and I wanted only the best for him.

I think, if it hadn’t been for his disease, he would’ve been able to save me.

By 2009, Colton lived in the city, fulfilling his dreams as a researcher in spite of his limbs and extremities stiffening. He would return home fairly frequently—Mother and Father were quite insistent upon it. Though they supported my brother’s move to the city, wanting him to achieve grand things, my parents also wanted as much time with the golden child as possible.

Around this time, when I was four, my parents’ intentions started to come to light—Colton was no longer around, and their true hellishness emerged. I had been Colton Jr when my big brother was around, but as soon as he left home—

“Backup Baby,” Father called. “Come here.”

As a naive boy at the time, I eagerly ran towards the pot-bellied man, thinking little of this new name. *Backup Baby* sounded quite cutesy and endearing.

“I’m looking over your report,” the man growled as I stood before him, beaming.

And I gulped, noting the stocky piece of white card on his lap—the sturdy school report listing results from recent tests: an A in English, and Bs in Maths and Science.

Father barked, “Next term, I expect you to receive an A for each and every core subject. Do you understand, boy?”

A few months later, however, only my English grade had upped; I’d felt rather proud of that A\*, but Father looked incensed.

“Sorry…” I whispered. “I’ll—”

“— *You’ll come with me*,” the man finished for me, with a chilled edge to the instruction.

Then Father shot up from the sofa, seized me by the wrist, and yanked my screaming, squirming body through the lobby and towards the basement door. Within a moment, that man, who was supposed to love me, had transformed into a nightmare. It is my first memory of true terror, and one that pales in comparison to the hell which would follow.

The basement door flung open to reveal a black cavity below our home, a place which had been beneath my feet for my first four years of life, yet no more than a door in the lobby—I hadn’t ever questioned what lay behind it. To a child’s eyes, untold hell hid in the basement’s dark recesses, and nothing I would experience down there helped to quell that fear.

“*MAMA!*” I shrieked as Father locked the basement door behind us, before shoving me down the groaning wooden steps.

“What have I told you?” the man hissed as he shoved me more forcefully.

I near-tripped down the last handful of steps, scuffing my fluffy socks against the hard floor below. Then came a thump on the back of my head, which drew a few tears from my eyes.

And finally, Father asked, “We are Mother and Father. Who are you, boy?”

I sniffled. “Colton.”

That answer earnt me a firmer backhand across the back of my crown.

“*WHO ARE YOU?*” he screamed as we stood in the blackness at the bottom of the stairs—all that existed in the void of a basement was Father’s hot, sour breath against my neck.

I croaked, head whirring from the force of the thump, then started to give the answer he wanted. “Backup…”

“*Baby*,” Father finished. “You are the continuation of Colton, but you are not him. You are a vessel.”

Father tugged a cord dangling from the ceiling to reveal a cluttered, squalid space. A dirt-smeared, unshaded bulb cast a grubby, orange glow that barely scraped the edges of the room—a basement containing a couple shelving units and countless stacks of unlabelled cardboard boxes.

My father brushed past me, flicked an empty box off an old, oakwood table, then dragged the furnishing into the middle of the room.

“Stand here,” he ordered, pointing behind the filthy desk; he gave the surface a quick dust with his sleeve, which did little more than smear the grime across the wood.

I nodded and did as I was told, knees knocking as I waited as the other side of the table. Meanwhile, my father rummaged through miscellaneous objects on a shelving unit and eventually found a torn-open stack of A4 paper. He removed a few sheets, plucked a blunt pencil from a rusty pot of stationery, then threw the items onto the dusted table before me.

“How long is your summer break?” he asked.

“Six… weeks,” I answered meekly. “Father, what is—”

“Forty-two days…” he interrupted softly, eyes wandering across the horrid room. “For forty-two days, you will study down here. This is your school. Your cafeteria. Your bedroom.”

My little eyes widened confusedly. “Bedroom…?”

“In September, you will enter Year One of school,” he continued, ignoring my question. “And on your first report card of the year, I will see three grades of A or higher. Do you understand?”

I trembled, horrified by the prospect of spending an entire summer in that underground prison. “Father, I… I need a chair… I need a bed…”

He barrelled towards me in response, then coiled his fingers around my neck. I would’ve let loose a screech if one could’ve slipped out of my constricted throat.

“*You will stand*,” my father croaked into my face, putrid breath reeking of tobacco and pale ale. “Only whilst you sleep will you rest your feet.”

He bound my shrieking lips with duct tape, then left me down there to rot.

Later that evening, Mother slipped a plate of salmon and several school books through the narrow basement window, leaving them atop a tall tower of cardboard boxes. And then Father returned to the basement an hour or so afterwards; I thought he’d come to his senses, ready to revoke the punishment and allow me back upstairs, but the man ignored my muffled cries and screams of horror.

Then he sat three small dolls, each six inches in height, on an empty shelf of the unit opposite my table. Handcrafted, porcelain monstrosities with antiquated, floral designs and bald heads.

“These are Backup Baby’s sitters,” Father whispered, pointing at the things’ black, beady eyes—glassy, reflective spheres that may have been cameras; they may, equally, have been nothing but empty threats made to cause me sleepless nights. “Do not touch your sitters if you wish to keep those fingers.”

My gagged wails earnt me a stern look from Father, who told me very firmly that I ought to be quiet—that Colton would be visiting soon, and Father wouldn’t hesitate to bring out the cane. I realise now that I should’ve made a racket. My brother would’ve done something. Of course, as a terrified four-year-old, I had neither the stomach nor the intellect to challenge Father, so I complied.

The following weekend, whilst Colton stayed and spent time with our *loving* parents above, I remained in blackness, stifling bawls, staring into only those doll’s black eyes in the darkness, which reflected a glint of moonlight pouring through the basement window.

I’m not sure what explanation Father gave Colton, with regards to my absence. A school trip, perhaps. When Mother passed meals into the basement, she would whisper that Colton didn’t ask a thing about me, but I didn’t believe that. *They* may well have believed it, as they always loathed the love that my brother showed towards me. They did not want him to see me as a sibling, or even a human.

After all, I was only ever Backup Baby.

For those six weeks, I sat on cardboard boxes until Mother or Father walked near the basement—then I would stand again to avoid being reprimanded. Over those summer months, as children of the free world laughed above the basement, I studied. Studied and wasted away, subsisting on meagre portions of salmon, and peas, and bread—on my birthday, I was given *two* slices.

When the first day of the new school year came, the basement door finally clicked open, and I rushed up the stairs to embrace Mother in a hug, bawling as I did so. And a few months later, the end of term report came back with three resoundingly positive grades: A, A, and A.

“No A\* in English this year,” Father muttered disapprovingly. “No matter. You may sleep above, Col…”

Father paused, so close to calling me Colton, which gave me a twinge of pride, until—

“Back to your room,” he hissed, nodding upstairs. “It’ll need dusting.”

I had severed social connections with classmates and friends, so as to spend every waking hour studying. After that stay in the basement, my stomach, joints, and skull had ached far more than was healthy or natural for a five-year-old. I didn’t want to be banished to the basement ever again.

Didn’t even want to see those three *sitters* again.

Years later, in 2016, Colton lost the motor functions necessary to live independently, so had to move home. My brother had become immobile and capable only of uttering a few staggered, struggling words. He was carried down to the kitchen by my father at dinnertime, but otherwise spent all of his time upstairs; my parents claimed that care was easier that way, but truthfully they simply wanted to keep him away from me. Away from the awfulness that Father wished to inflict upon me.

The basement had been only the tip of the iceberg.

One night, whilst I pretended to sleep in my room, Mother and Father spoke on the landing. And the terrible truth poured free.

“We have wasted eleven years of our lives on him,” Mother moaned. “No matter how well we mould his mind, or body, he lacks Colton’s face. Eyes. Smile.”

“I know,” Father whispered. “You have said as much for years.”

“Sorry,” Mother timidly apologised.

“No, my dear. I meant only that, since you first mentioned it, I have been searching,” he replied.

“Searching?” she croaked.

“Colton hasn’t long left in this world,” Father said, “so we must act quickly.”

Mother winced. “Please, dear. I don’t like it when you talk that way.”

“Why else did we have the backup?” he hissed. “You have done so much for us, love, and I have spent four years trying to repay the favour. At long last, I have found someone who might help us.”

“*Found* someone?” Mother repeated.

Father shifted his weight on the floorboards outside my bedroom door, and I tightened the duvet cover under my chin, shuddering uncontrollably at the thought of them finding me eavesdropping.

“Found a man who will help us,” Father explained.

“What have you done?” Mother gasped. “We promised that we would never say a word to another soul. Who have you told about our… *situation?*”

“A man who will never tell our secret to another soul,” responded Father icily.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I came downstairs to find Colton sitting at the kitchen table. He seemed just as baffled as me that Father had gone to the effort of carrying him downstairs for breakfast; that was a treat reserved for dinner.

“Colton!” I cried excitably, giving my older brother a warm hug. “Why are you down here?”

He shrugged ungiving shoulders, grunting painfully; it had become difficult for him to string together sentences or move his body.

“Mother? Father?” I asked. “Why is Colton here?”

Our parents simply laughed off the question, offering me wide, unfeeling smiles, then Mother began to feed Cornflakes to Colton. I shrugged my shoulders, tucking into my own bowl. But as darkness ate the edges of my vision, and wooziness filled my body, my brain finished waking up—I remembered the conversation I’d caught the night before.

“M… Mama…?” Colton suddenly mumbled, head lolling forwards.

“Shush…” she whispered in return, walking over to him. “Sleep now.”

The last thing I heard, once my vision had faded, was Father’s voice in my ear, tunnelling down with that pungent breath. “You will look upon us differently when you next open your eyes.”

I woke to the stammering sounds of my brother.

“Mama… Papa… What…?” he croaked, vocal cords mostly functionless.

My face felt numb, yet I felt a slight strain behind my eyes—felt an unnerving artificiality from the neck upwards. As I pulled my eyelids open, there was an unmistakeable difference to the way in which I saw the world around me. Through blurry vision, I sensed that I was lying on a bed, or a table, and that I was in the place I dreaded most: the basement.

“He’s alive,” whispered Mother from a chair beside me.

And then I made out a middle-aged, white-coated man sitting on a chair, just past the edge of my bed, but Mother wasn’t talking to him—she was ignoring him, as a matter of fact, regardless of his mumbled, incoherent groans from a gaping mouth. I worked hard to adjust my eyes, and then I realised something which horrified me.

The stranger had no tongue.

I tried to produce some kind of haunted cry for help, but nothing would come out of my depleted body. And as I focused on the man opposite me, I realised that he wasn’t *sitting* at all. He was bound to the chair, for he had no way of sitting; his legs had been severed midway through the thighs.

I squirmed as I screeched inwardly, unleashing only a feeble puff of air from my the weak lungs and lips of my drowsy body.

Instead, I twisted my head to the source of the voice that had woken me, facing my brother. He lay on something akin to an operating table, a white bandage over his eyes, stained with splotches of red; blood was pouring out of the sides.

Terrifying thoughts filled my mind of what it all might mean—what might have happened.

Then came the plodding of footsteps down the basement stairs from the man Mother had called.

“Do we think the surgeon did well?” Father asked.

Mother sniffled and nodded. “He looks beautiful.”

Then she held up a mirror to my eyes, and I screamed at the foreign, blue things in my skull—precious things that belonged to Colton. The golden child. The one they supposedly loved, who lay on the table beside me without restraints, as his muscles had given up long ago; he wouldn’t have been able to flee if he had tried. Certainly wouldn’t have been able to save me.

“Why… Papa…?” my brother croaked, blind to the world.

I watched Father walk over to his son and place a tender hand on his leg, but his eyes were on *me*. “So that you may survive, my prize. So that you may continue to see the world and live through him.”

All of a sudden, the empty-mouthed surgeon screamed, rocked his chair backwards, then crashed into the shelving unit behind him. And the trio of porcelain dolls, my old sitters, fell. All three smashed when they hit the floor, and, to my eyes, long white sticks came loose.

“*You desecrator…*” Mother howled, rising to her feet and yelping as she dashed to the mute, legless surgeon lying bound to that toppled chair on the floor.

What followed was just beyond my line of view, for I only could only tilt my head slightly to get a view of the floor—I saw the doll remnants, and the surgeon’s lower half, but not what happened above. I heard it though. The stomp of a shoe against flesh and bone, along with the surgeon’s few frail moans—each frailer than the last.

Seconds later, the only sounds he made were wet squelches and snaps.

Father placed a hand on Mother’s shoulder. “It is over now.”

“He disrespected our girls…” she hissed.

“What… is… happening?” my brother moaned from beside me.

“Girl, after girl, after girl,” Father sighed, eyeing the pile of white sticks amidst the broken porcelain fragments; a pool of red was spreading towards them from the surgeon’s corpse. “*The fourth time was the charm*.”

As I eyed the three broken dolls on the floor, and their little white fragments within, I began to hyperventilate—fear gripped me as I contemplated the unimaginable. And as Father and Mother bounced upstairs, laughing deliriously at the success of their deranged operation, I was left lying there in the basement with my grunting brother and the three skeletal baby remains.

At some point in the night, Colton’s grunting stopped, as did his breathing. There were streaks of dry blood on his face, trailing back to the white bandage over his empty eye sockets. I assume that his surgery must’ve been botched by the abducted, mutilated surgeon, who had been forced to perform the operation under duress. Colton must have succumbed to blood loss.

Whatever the case, I was glad for my brother. Glad that his suffering was over. Glad that he didn’t have to suffer long with the knowledge of how grotesque our parents had truly been.

The next morning, in a dozy state, I found myself being dragged out of the darkened basement by Father, and I came out as Colton: a blue-eyed, athletic, straight-A student. My parents never called me Backup Baby again.

Most horribly of all, I have never once, in the years since, considered running for my life. Even this story is one I tell with a mixture of false names and great trepidation, as Father gave me a very stern warning upon pulling me out of the basement.

“There are two options: be Colton or be with the sitters.”

Even now, as a twenty-year-old man preparing to leave home, I do not feel as if I have truly found a way of escaping from them. Trauma is a powerful restraint. Father is happy to let me out into the world, for he knows that I will forever be too terrified of him and Mother to say or do anything.

Too terrified that, no matter how big I grow, I may end up encased in porcelain [too](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
