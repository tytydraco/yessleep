**The List**

The envelope showed up under my door two weeks after Olivia moved in. No stamp, no return address—just my name in tight, scrawled handwriting. I might’ve ignored it if I hadn’t caught her ex’s name on the flap: Mark.

Inside was a single sheet of paper titled: “Tips for Dating Olivia.”

The list started harmless enough, almost helpful:

• Her favorite cake is carrot (no raisins).

• She hates lavender-scented candles.

• Her birthday is March 14th. Lilies are her favorite.

It wasn’t until I reached the bottom of the page that something felt off: 

• If she says, “The trees are blossoming,” reply, “Life is beautiful.” You must get this right.

I laughed, even as a chill rippled down my spine. A joke, I thought, his pathetic way of messing with me. Olivia had warned me about Mark—manipulative, obsessive, unable to let go.

I crumpled the note and tossed it in the trash.

**It Starts**

The first time it happened, we were walking through the park. The cherry blossoms were blooming, pink petals floating in the breeze. Olivia stopped, staring up at the trees.

“The trees are blossoming,” she said softly, her voice distant, almost reverent.

Something in my chest tightened. Without thinking, I blurted, “Life is beautiful.”

Her head tilted slightly, and for a moment, she just… stared at me. Then she smiled, warm and soft. “Yes,” she said, as though I’d passed some invisible test.

The list came back to me that night. I fished it out of the trash and smoothed the wrinkles.

**The Rules**

It wasn’t long before I started relying on the list. Every little detail lined up perfectly: her favorite foods, her quirks, even the exact way she liked her coffee. Following it felt like a cheat code to her heart.

But then the rules got stranger.

• Always knock twice before entering her apartment, even if she tells you not to.

• If she hums a tune you don’t recognize, hum along. She’ll stop after a minute, and it’s important that she does.

• Never look at her reflection in mirrors if she isn’t in the room.

I wanted to laugh it off, but the first time I forgot to knock twice, Olivia didn’t speak to me for hours. She didn’t seem angry, just… off. She stared at me like she didn’t recognize me, her movements slow and deliberate, like a predator sizing up prey.

When I hummed along to an unfamiliar melody one night, she stopped mid-tune, sighed deeply, and fell asleep. I didn’t.

**Cracks in the Facade**

The list grew longer. I didn’t know how—I hadn’t added to it. But new rules appeared in the same frantic handwriting:

• If she sleeps past 3:33 AM, wake her immediately. If she doesn’t wake, leave the room.

• She will never tell you her mother’s name. Don’t ask. Don’t try to find out.

• Burn the list, and she’ll know.

I tested that last one. Held the corner of the paper over a lighter. The flame leapt unnaturally fast, black veins racing through the page. The smoke smelled like something rotting, and Olivia knocked on the door before I could finish.

“You okay in there?” she asked. Her voice was light, but something in her tone made me freeze.

I didn’t try burning it again.

**The Whispering**

The rules stopped being enough. I started hearing whispers when Olivia wasn’t around—soft, guttural voices coming from nowhere. Once, I caught her reflection in the bathroom mirror when she wasn’t in the room. It wasn’t her face looking back. The eyes were too wide, the smile too sharp.

I covered every mirror in the house after that.

The nights were the worst. I’d wake up at 3:32 AM, sweating, heart pounding, just in time to see her stir. I’d shake her awake, and she’d mumble something before turning over. But one night, I woke up late.

3:34 AM.

She was still, her chest rising and falling with slow, shallow breaths. I reached out to shake her, but her eyes snapped open before I touched her. They weren’t her eyes. They were dark, endless voids that swallowed the room.

“You’re late,” she said.

**The Exit**

I couldn’t stay. I couldn’t leave. Every time I tried to confront her, she’d tilt her head and smile, and I’d forget what I wanted to say.

Then the final rule appeared at the bottom of the list:

• The only way out is to pass it on. Find someone else. Leave the list. Do not warn them.

I knew what it meant. I didn’t want to believe it, but deep down, I did.

A week later, I slipped an envelope under the door of someone Olivia had been texting. Just a friend, she’d said. A new guy.

Inside was a fresh copy of the list, rewritten in my own hand.

I moved out that same night. I blocked her number, deleted her pictures, but I know she’s still out there. And the whispers… they haven’t stopped.

If you’re reading this, it’s too late. You’ll know what to do when the time comes. Just make sure you follow the rules.
