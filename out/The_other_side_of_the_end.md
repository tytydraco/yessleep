Minus two hours til impact



*The government alert system will repeat as follows: In two hours The Comet will collide with earth. Remain at home and comply with military instructions. You can not evacuate. Remain calm. Please wait for a message from your president”*



That was the chatter on the box. Running on repeat for the last 3 days.  Could we ever believe what was going on?  When I first read the news I was one of the believers. I was one of them. It didn’t take long for the others' views to sour. To say it wasn’t gonna be real. It didn’t take long for my family to hear me drinking. I watched my neighbors scrambling beneath me as I sat on my lawn chair, which I quickly named the “thrown”. My preparation was as good as the next guy. Cooler of beer and handful of cigars. I even managed to get my bottle of irish whiskey up here. Was there anything better than a good shot of bad whiskey in this life? All I had to do was pull the trigger. But for some ungodly reason, I chose to drink. 



I should give some context… Three months ago we heard of the comet. Apparently, they’ve been tracking it for years. We prepared as one would. Kisses and hugs soon turned to whispers and conspiracies about who knew it was coming first. The second casualty in any war  is reason. People stopped looking out for each other. I’m also to blame in that regard. I ran to the store and got water for my people.  I was thinking that one case would be sufficient. Jokes on the egotistical survivalists for believing 24 cases of water would be enough to survive about 20 kilotons of force. But I digress



Anyway, food was a premium and water was, well, water was as valuable as…. Just see above. 



I don’t remember exactly when it ended. As you know, I’ve been drinking. So, take this for what you will. I don’t remember when it hit. I don’t remember the neighbors screaming. I just remember waking up. When I woke up on the roof there was nothing. Silence.I should have known the silence was alarming. 



This isn’t a scorched earth. God, how I hoped I would have seen fires. I see emptiness now. No neighbors. No honking cars desperately trying to scrap any second of salvation. No barking, no buzzing, no fucking white noise. 



I climbed off my roof and there wasn’t even a buzz of a fly. I ventured into the city and saw the intact buildings. Electricity illuminates every business as if it was a common Tuesday. My calmness turned to panic. Why didn’t this comet cause the anticipated destruction? The empty cars and businesses and skyscrapers told me exactly what I needed to know. I am alone.



Is this death?



I smelled the air. Desperate for anything I began to smell the ground. I even tried to smell the dirt. Let me smell dog shit at this point. There was nothing. The trees, flowers and roots were all there. The trash, the filth, the human element was also there. But no humans, no smell, and nothing I touched gave me any feeling. I searched for something, anything. Nothing.

I yearn for someone to tell me. Did I miss something? Did I do something wrong? I thought death would be like birth. Nothingness. It’d be like you were never here. But this. This is different. This is being alone.

I wanted to see the comet hit the earth on my roof. I did everything I was supposed to do. But why am I still walking in this wasteland? Please someone respond.



I don’t think I’m dead. God i wish i was



I wish i was dead.
