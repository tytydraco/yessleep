I’m a first responders dispatcher, I work on a 2 week pay schedule first week is 4 days of 12a-12p the second is 3 days 12a-12p. I handle everything from calls requesting life alert helicopters for dear stuck on icy lakes to fires, disputes and medical emergency’s. My town has a population of 2k and the county population can go from 15k-22k depending on season. Generally nothing happens 12a-6a aside from elders falling on their way to the bathroom or unattended deaths. Unattended deaths are not murders but people passing in their home alone either from heart attacks or old age there found by visitors checking in. 

Background and helpful information: 39 means a city officer 56 is county so 3901 is city sheriff and 5606 is county sheriff. Our fire and ambulance is all volunteer so it can take 5 minutes too 1-4 hours to get a response from pages out and calling personnel phones Generally locals don’t call 911 for amb but to pass word to next towns hospital, we don’t have one in my town, we only have a place for bruised knees and common colds. Things we don’t note down are ‘ghost calls’ there a 911 call from a 911 num, 000 num and sometimes [      ]. We don’t know why they come in but assume that there a rouge current in the line, since they don’t geo locate on any of our tracker maps, allow for a call back option, and when we stay on the line there’s no sound aside from a rhythm of soft buzz trailing in and out. 

My weekly routine guarantees I see the same exact people every morning for 24/7 pbt test. It’s a probation check for dui drivers so they can work and not go to jail for a few months. The same three people come in every morning at 7am. First is Greg he’s a older guy a little short looks like a angry logger, he’s never late always shows up at 7:02a and if he’s late he always makes it in before 7:15a. He’s a nice guy always happy to get back to work without delay. 
The next is Ms. Paige she’s always almost late. They have to be tested between 7a-8a and no later unless court ordered. Paige always shows up between 7:40a-7:55a she’s been late a few times. Being late means a strike on the check in record and if you get too many you’ll be sent back to jail of removed from the program. She’s not my favorite, complains a lot and talks too much. 
The last one is Issac, he’s my favorite he’s permitted to test between 6a and 7a he’s always on time too between 6:20 and 6:30. He’s always polite and respectful. I think he works for the local lumber yard/train yard. The job sites are connected and my town main export is pine lumber via train. The tracks end 3 miles north of town they used to go into Canada but were removed to make room for the koocanusa and its dam, they removed a whole town too. 

They’re listed in order of when they were added to the system, or I think so. I took this job because I’m slightly obsessed with consistency. I don’t like when the regular way something works gets flipped, I can’t work a job where each day may be different I need a constant flow of rules and procedures. I finally found my job, I enter warrants, protection orders, run vehicles and handle a system of calls and because government is very strict the procedure will not change and I know how to respond each time. That leads me here now, when a pbt blower finishes the program there name becomes grayed out and they are sorted to the bottom of the list, they don’t remove them in order to have record of each day and every test. It’s my job to let the probation officer who doesn’t show who failed the test and if the website isn’t working.

Today being my Friday I was getting ready to test Paige, she never showed up and I went to mark her for today but she wasn’t on the list anymore. I checked the bottom of the list and she wasn’t listed there either. I gave the probation officer Allie a call and he sounded very busy and brushed me off with a quick, “Who, what I don’t have time if someone didn’t show just have whoever gets on shift first go check there place out ok.——“ and he hung up. Right now I do have a county officer on shift but he’s not 10-8 yet and I don’t know when he will call on. This isn’t a call out and the on duty officer has a nasty morning attitude. I’m going to wait for him to call on shift and get coffee before sending him out. I think she wasn’t the most pleasant person to deal with, I think she was just annoying. 

If anything was explained poorly or anyone wants a better explanation please don’t be afraid to ask. I’m trying my best to write this on my phone it may be messy. You can call me by my user, U56729 or dispatcher 662, I’m going to make a strong pot of coffee and get rid of this headache take care. I’ll update you all next time I’m on shift with what my officer 5612 finds.
