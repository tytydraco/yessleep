Let me start this by saying this was many years ago, however this is exactly how everything happened in my memory. At the time of this memory I must have been about five years old. I remember coming home from pre-school and going to Blockbuster (for those of you younger than me, that was a place you would go to rent DVDs and VHS tapes, when streaming services didn’t exist yet). We rented Nanny McPhee for me, and my mom and dad also rented a movie that I wasn’t allowed to watch with them. Going to Blockbuster was a normal thing for my family, we usually went 2-3 times a week to rent movies. After that my memory gets foggy and I don’t remember exactly what happens, but I remember my mom kissing me goodnight once I went to bed. I was a stereotypical boy who had a racecar bed when I was little, and I had LOTS of stuffed animals. From my memory, I remember having a pastel multicolored dolphin, a cheetah (my mom got it for me, she was a respiratory therapist and worked in the C.H.E.T.A. Program, which is a critical care ambulance service at UW-Madison), a large scooby-doo plushie, MANY kitten plushies that came in a pack that my grandma bought me for Christmas, and a life size (for me as a five year old) spider-man stuffed animal, which had glow in the dark eyes. Every night when I went to sleep I’d choose a few stuffed animals to keep in my bed with me. I don’t remember what I chose that night, but I know I didn’t choose Spider-Man, because I remember staring at his glowing eyes across the room as I was falling asleep.

My mom kissed me goodnight and shut the door. I dozed off and fell asleep, but I ended up waking up. I remember opening my eyes and still seeing Spider-Man’s eyes on the other side of the room, so I thought it hadn’t been too long since I fell asleep. I stared at spider man’s eyes and tried to fall back asleep. As I was staring into his eyes, his eyes rose upwards and froze. Spider man had to have been about 3 feet tall when I had him standing, and I could tell he was standing by himself at this point. From there, the eyes started moving towards me. Obviously, being five years old, I screamed. I screamed bloody murder, I don’t think I ever screamed that loud in my life, and a few seconds later my mom came bursting into the room. As my mom burst into the door, and the light bled into the room, the spider man toy dropped to the floor. It had been about 4-5 feet from my bed, and walking. As the light of the hallway hit it, it froze and hit the ground. Both my mom and I saw spider man hit the ground as she opened the door, and she ran into the room and asked me what happened. I told her everything and she immediately grabbed spider man from the middle of my room and took him away. When she came back she brought her laptop and we watched the Nanny McPhee DVD that we had rented, and my mom slept in my room that night. That night actually started a trend of me and my mom having movie nights in my room here and there, where we would rent movies and watch them in my room on her laptop, making popcorn and eating candy that we bought from blockbuster when we rented the movie. 

We had a garage sale a month or two later, and my mom and dad ended up selling spider man at the garage sale (they also sold scooby-doo at the yard sale, and I remember being very upset about that because I loved scooby). I never saw spider-man again, but even as a kid I was thankful for that. After this experience, spider man scared me. This was probably the most vivid memory of my childhood, and one of the only memories I have of my parents together before they got divorced when I was six.
