I work at an establishment that specializes in children's birthday parties. We have a group of characters that sings the birthday and are on all the cups. One of the things the place is known for is the animatronics of those characters.

Almost everyone my age (people who grew up on the internet) who comes in asks about the animatronics and compares it to FNAF. Y'know, the typical "Are they alive?" "Have you seen them move?", and so on. 

I started working there recently, so I always thought the other employees were joking when they would answer \*yes\*. It's the type of thing where you play along with the bit, like improv or whatever. Like when a kid comes up to you and says they have superpowers, you just play along. That's all it was.

At least that's all I thought it was. 

I don't often work the opening shift, I'm not a manager or anything, but I took someone elses shift. The managers have a rule that no one opens or closes alone, so I wasn't alone when I entered the building at 5am. Normally people don't come in until after lunch (kids don't tend to want to get up in the morning), so we have the morning to ourselves. It's mostly set up; cleaning tables, changing out the napkin holders, setting up the VIP birthday tables, food and salad bar prep, etc. The manager who opened with me had to call into a meeting with the big bosses (I don't exactly know, I wasn't listening), and she was going to be closed in her office until 8am. 

So I was essentially alone for the morning. 

I put on my headphones and started going around and sweeping the main floor. The set up of the store/restaurant(?) is pretty simple. You enter and have the front counter immediately infront of you, directly to your left is the main/game room. Its a large area that has all of the arcade machines and the tables. There is a hallway at the back that goes to the kitchen, that is behind the front counter (the break room and managers office are there too), bathrooms, and a storage room. 

I am usually the one who has to deal with the animatronics. We don't really set up the animatronics anymore, instead there is a suit that an employee (usually me) wears. The animatronics haven't been turned on or plugged in in years, and tend to gather dust-bunnies like flies to fly paper.

Both the suit and animatronics are in this storage room. Part of my opening routine is to go into the storage room and clear out any dust that has gathered. 

Thats where I was at like 5:30. 

I was jamming, as one does when they have their music turned all the way up. I was sweeping and minding my business, when one of the animatronics turned on. I didn't think much about it, there was a work party the night before and they must have messed with the animatronics for fun. 

The animatronics are in a line, backs to a wall. This means that I have to go around and behind the other animatronics to get to this ones plug. I struggle, stepping through cobwebs one after another. I get to the one that turned on and its not plugged in. 

The thing about this specific character is that it wouldn't (or shouldn't) work even if it was plugged in. A while back a rat had chewed through the cord. I stood behind the wall of characters, staring at this cord for a solid minute, perplexed. 

I decided that it must be left over juice from when I was plugged in, so I left it alone. If you couldn't tell, I don't know much about the machinery of the animatronics. 

I slide out from behind the character line-up and was about to return to my chores when I see a light. I thought it was a reflection at first, because it moved. It couldn't be, there was no window, and the only light source was from the main room light spilling in through the open storage door. I turn. The animatronic (the mouse) I was looking at had turned its head to look at me. 

I felt my stomach drop. 

It had to be someone messing with the new employee. I stepped out of the room, shouting, "I swear if one of you is trying to scare me I will punch you if you show up behind me in that suit."  
I returned to the room and put the mouse's head back in the resting position. Not scared, but still on edge, I continued sweeping. After 3 or 4 beats, I heard a clunk. 

The mouse was looking at me again. This time, however, it was in the middle of stepping off of the platform the characters were all lined up on. I frooze. No way this was happening. 

It had to be a joke, right?

I decided it wouldn't phase me, so I kept sweeping. Albeit without my headphones on. Even if it was turned on somehow, its not like it would hurt me. It was programed to sing Happy Birthday and do a dumb dance. The most it could do was sing to loud or out of tune.   
Right?  
Thankfully, the mouse was quiet for a while as I finished up sweeping. Unfortunately, the world is cruel. As I finished tossing the colony of dust bunnies in the bin, I heard that dreadful clunk clunk. I should elaborate, the clunk sound is not the sound of dropping a trunk on the ground. It is the grating sound of jagged metal dragging across cement floors. It is not high pitched, rather its like biting down on chalk. 

That god damn mouse was infront of the door. The door was still open, but the entrance was blocked by this 6 foot something mouse robot. My phone told me that it was 6:15. The next person  scheduled to come in was at 7. I sighed, *ffuck this*.

I decided that 3 times is too many. I crawled under the legs of the mouse and out of the storage room. There was no way I was touching that thing, let alone moving it back. So I just closed the door. I was on kitchen duty that day, so I didn't have to wear the suit. 

Thankfully. 

No one else said anything about the animatronics, and I didn't say anything. 

I haven't been scheduled for an opening shift since. I'm not worried about opening again.

I am, however, worried about my closing shift tomorrow.
