Sunday morning rolls around and my family and I get ready to head to the markets as per our weekly ritual. When we arrived we parked and head into the racecourse where the markets were held.

We were walking around for about 30 mins or so before my mum found an antique stall. She fell in love with a wooden TV unit. 

It was beautifully stained oak wood, with stained glass on the side cupboard doors and solid oak on the front cupboards. As soon as she saw it she bought it instantly and got her now, ex husband to take it to the car, it was too heavy for any of my sibling and I to help, so we all ended up going to the car.

Once the unit was loaded in and my mum was satisfied it was well hidden and safe, we headed back to the stall as my mum had seen a bookcase and chest that looked to be a set with the unit.

We arrived back at the same spot but the stall had disappeared. My mum asked the neighbouring stalls if they know where the antique stall had gone and everyone said the same thing: “There are no antique stalls here.”

Defeated and confused my mum decided that that was it for the markets and we headed home.

First night the unit was brought into the house, I heard loud knocking coming from the living room. It grew louder an only continued for about 30 seconds, but was enough to make me sleep under my blanket the rest of the night in 30°C.

Next morning after walking into the kitchen to get ready for school feeling like death, I saw that my older brother and mum had similar tiredness as me. 

I was too tired to ask, but thankfully my brother did it anyways and come to find out they both heard the exact same knocking from the night before. It happened daily.

2 weeks later, it got worse. At around 2/3am the couples of weeks after, I saw a figure standing in my doorway looking away from me. Took my chance and slipped under my blanket again. This continued happening and the figure kept creeping closer and closer every night I awoke.

2 days later my mum encountered a man in a wheel chair sitting at the end of her bed staring at her and her ex, watching them sleep.

On the same night my my older brother saw a woman float past his room at the back of the house facing the backyard with only her upper half, the window was only on the top 1/3rd of the wall, so about 3-4 meters above ground.

My mums ex didn’t believe her until he woke up one day in the middle of the night, this has now been about 3 days after my brothers sighting. That was the final straw for us.

We found a new rental within 2 days and left everything behind. To whoever moved in after us, we hope you made it. We hope you were able to stay hidden. We hope you were able to stay quiet.
