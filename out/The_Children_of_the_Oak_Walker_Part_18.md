[\[Part 17\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1avvxxt/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_17/)

The old green van wound through more of the tight side streets of Black Oak, the buildings becoming more and more decrepit as we went. Lawns stood overgrown in places, some buildings were cordoned off with yellow caution tape, and a few cars sat abandoned on the side of the road, burned or smashed to pieces. Trash lay clumped together the storm gutters, and there were even a few scattered articles of clothing discarded on some sections of sidewalk. I’d been to some of the poorer areas in Louisville, but this shocked me; everyone in New Wilderness had spoken of Black Oak as the wealthier part of Barron County.  
“Can you believe this used to be one of the higher-end neighborhoods?” As if she could read my mind, Andrea’s blue eyes lost some of their feisty gleam, and she jerked her head toward the ruined urban landscape outside our windows. “When ELSAR first rolled into town, everyone thought they were here to save us. The mayor even threw a parade down main street. Then the walls went up, and the checkpoints, and the signal-jammers . . . by the time people started to question it all, it was too late.”  
My eyes fixed on a small stuffed horse lying on a front porch, the door to the silent house ajar, much of the front glass broken. “But why don’t more people fight? I mean, there’s like 10,000 citizens here, right? They can’t shoot everyone.”  
“They don’t have to.” Josh winced as he daubed at his torn ear with the corner of his uniform sleeve. “You know those jackboot clowns who had you in a cell?”  
I nodded, doubtful I would ever be able to forget that awful place as long as I lived.  
“We call em Organs, like in an old Russian book we found after ELSAR tossed a bunch of stuff from our public library.” Josh sneered, as if merely describing them made him want to punch a wall. “They’re all locals, mostly students recruited from the city college to help keep order whenever people get treasonous ideas in their heads . . . like trying to leave. Conveniently, they also replaced most of the old cops, who refused to follow the city’s orders. The regular mercs are ex-military, and depending on the unit they aren’t always bad, but the Organs are a whole new breed of evil.”  
In my head, the screams returned, helpless men and women enduring horrible atrocities for seemingly no reason at all. My skin crawled at the memory of the guard’s hand on my butt, his rank breath on my cheek, his cruel laugh as he promised to come back for me later. How many girls had been trapped there, and never got out? Just the thought of being back in that tiny concrete room with no hope of escape made me nauseous, and I had to shut my eyes to drive away the dozens of strangled, hopeless shrieks I’d heard from the door of my cell.  
*That would have been me. Good God, that was almost me. How on earth could they do that to their own people?*  
“But you guys have guns.” I swallowed and gripped my rifle tighter. “This is Ohio, there’s got to be enough weapons in town to push them out.”  
“You don’t think they knew that?” One of the older boys in the huddle sighed and looked down at the well-worn lever action across his lap with a frown. “First thing they did was ask people to ‘donate’ any extra guns or ammo they had for the auxiliaries. Claimed they didn’t have enough to form a defensive line around town. Of course, everyone was scared of the monsters, and the Organs hadn’t started arresting people yet, so lots of the adults volunteered. That’s how they figured out which houses had weapons, and which didn’t. After that they just went door-to-door at night when people were asleep, so no one had time to fight back.”  
“And for those who didn’t say anything?” I shook my head, astounded at the night-and-day difference from the tyrannical control of this place and the utter abandonment of the rural sections of Barron County. “I mean, not everyone would have donated, right? What about people who stayed quiet?”  
“They sicked the Organs on their families.” Andrea pulled both legs in to her chest, and her face rippled in a flash of pained grief. “It’s easy to be stubborn when all you have is yourself, but what father wouldn’t hand over his rifle if they had his daughter stripped naked in a cell? They targeted girls specifically, either for imprisonment or indoctrination; after all, some of their best officers are women. In the end it didn’t matter though. Lots of kids willingly turned in their parents, and parents reported their children like clockwork.”  
*They did what?*  
My jaw dropped, but Josh’s blood-smeared face took on a hateful scowl. “Collaborator families get higher food rations and live in a nicer part of town with no power restrictions. One of my younger sister’s friends turned me in because she found out I was breaking curfew to meet with a girl I liked, and the Organs gave out a promotion for every ‘insurgent’ their members caught. Only reason I got away was because Samantha called our landline and said there were soldiers in her backyard waiting for me.”  
Biting my lip, I dared to speak the unasked question aloud that hung in the air between us like fog. “What happened to her?”  
His eyes moistened, and Josh blinked the tears away with an angry hoarseness to his voice. “The Organs took her as soon as they traced the call. I heard it, all of it, right over the phone. My sister got sent to a ‘social adaptation’ center in the northern district, and my parents agreed to denounce me in a radio commercial, in order to keep her from the same fate as Samantha. The girl that reported us got an interview with Sheriff Wurnauw on TV, and now her family gets three square meals a day, versus the usual one. A *rich* reward for a *loyal* citizen.”  
Those last words he spat out like a line from a well-known but immensely hated commercial, and the van went silent for a few seconds as we continued to bump along over potholes, ruts, and cracked asphalt.  
*Thunk, thunk.*  
Knuckles rapped on the metal of the van, and as one, we all looked toward the front, where the wrinkly old driver pointed ahead. “We’re here.”  
A run-down gas station came into view, with a tall sheet-metal garage attacked to it, the old parking lot covered in miscellaneous garbage. Cracks spiderwebbed over the cement pad next to the old gas pumps, and slabs of plywood were nailed over the windows of the main station, swollen from exposure to the rain. A faded sign read, ‘Allen’s Gas and Groceries’, most of the color long since chipped away. It had a chain-link fence around it, but the bent gate was propped open, and the sputtering Volkswagen rolled to a stop in front of the garage’s massive sliding doors.  
*Creeeaak.*  
Both steel doors trundled open, and I caught the silhouettes of more people inside, suspicious eyes trained on us over the barrels of rifles. Much of the dimly lit interior was heaped with junk, but there was enough space to pull the van in-between the barrels, metalworking machines, and unused car parts. A few lights glowed from within, but not many, and it struck me as the kind of place I would have suspected for a drug dealer’s hideout if we’d been in Louisville.  
The old man in the driver’s seat flicked his lights in some sort of pre-set signal, and we rumbled into the building.  
“Caught some lead out there, did ya?” A bony man, likely in his mid-forties, with scraggly brown facial hair and a shortened Kalashnikov in his hands spat a stream of tobacco juice out the doorway as the others dragged them shut.  
“Just some stray shots.” It took the elderly driver a few tries to climb down from his seat, and when he finally touched down on the garage floor, he walked slightly bent over. In one wrinkled hand, the old-timer lugged an aged M1 carbine, the finish as scratched and chipped as he was wrinkled and gray. “Once we got clear of the regulars, it wasn’t so bad. Those Organ fools couldn’t shoot straight with their pants around their ankles, and a pretty girl holding the light. They got them fancy laser sights, makes them too cocky. In Korea all we had were irons, and boy, we didn’t miss nearly that much.”  
“Alright, whatever you have to do, make it fast and disperse.” As we clambered out of the back of the van, Tex barked orders to the other fighters, and guided me out of the group with one hand on my arm. “You’re with me. Their surveillance satellites don’t always work thanks to the electromagnetic radiation, but they have some good days. If they spotted us drive in here, we’ve got maybe five minutes to clear the site before their armored trucks roll in. We have to get you clean in that time.”  
Confused, I looked down at myself, most of the grime from our desperate flight on my borrowed orange jumpsuit. “I’m not that dirty.”  
“Your tracker.” He tapped the back of his own neck, and we wove between a few darkened shop lifts to where a cubicle of white sheets had been set up in one corner, flooded with light from the inside. “If we don’t take it out, it’ll lead them right to us like rats to cheese. We used to be able to just pop the old ones off, but they made this new type that burrows into your skin, so it has to be cut out.”  
*Of course it does. I’m getting really tired of being everyone’s practice suture pad. I’m going to be more scars than person at this rate.*  
My skin went clammy with dread, but I followed him into the makeshift booth, determined to do whatever it took to stay out of ELSAR’s hands. The other fighters sorted themselves into pairs or threes, and they tugged aside a large circular manhole cover in the floor to lower themselves in one-by-one. Only the few men who had been in the garage already remained, along with the elderly driver, who stood with his carbine slung on one sinewy shoulder, smoking a cigarette.  
Inside the cubicle, a weightlifter’s bench had been draped in a white drop cloth, and a metal tray sat on a small table near it, lined with surgical tools. Two freestanding lights on poles hovered over the bench, and a figure in white stood with his back to us, washing both gloved hands in a stainless-steel bowl of something that stank like soap. No type of anesthetic drip sat anywhere, and my guts churned at the thought that I might have to undergo yet another terrible operation without drugs to dull the pain.  
“Tiger.” Tex called to the white-clad person as he directed me to the bench. “We got her.”  
The figure shook his hands dry, and my heart skipped a stunned beat as he turned to face us.  
*What the . . .*  
His swarthy face pulled into a meek smile, and Kaba lost some of the heightened strain in his cheeks. “Good to see you again, Hannah.”  
Blood running ice cold in paranoia, I looked at Tex, then Kaba, and slid back on the bench to palm for my rifle. “H-he’s with ELSAR. He’s one of them, I know he is. He was in their medical wing, and—”  
“And he’s kept more people out of the Organ’s hands than anyone.” Andrea appeared from behind the curtain, donned in her own blue latex gloves and white apron. “A few months back, ELSAR installed some VR booths in the library, to distract the public from the fact that they purged a bunch of books. Tiger got us the codes to one, and we used it to hack your tracker chip. Naturally, the Organs transferred you for security reasons, but thanks to Tex, we knew all about their protocols, and found you anyway.”  
My eyes narrowed, and I glanced at the hulking Tex as the dots connected in my mind. Of the two, he fit his uniform far better than Josh. He’d known their security protocol, had walked into their headquarters to steal me, and no one had been any the wiser until the last minute. Crow had called out his name, hesitated to shoot . . . because Kaba wasn’t the only ELSAR man here.  
“You were part of ELSAR too?” I blinked at him, unsure how to react.  
“It’s a long story.” Tex checked his watch. “One we don’t have time for right now. I quit the mercs when I figured out that we were here to guard the suits, and not the civilians. Kaba and I were squad mates then.”  
Kaba nodded, his sandalwood brown eyes deep in thought. “Back when all we had to worry about was drinking enough water and getting paid.”  
Somewhere in the distance, a siren wailed, and both men were shaken from their momentary stupor.  
Adjusting a latex glove on his hand, Kaba raised his eyes to mine. “So, ready to give Koranti a big middle finger?”  
*Absolutely.*  
I lay face-down on the bench, some towels bunched around my chin to keep my head still, while Kaba and Andrea bent over my skull. They lifted the hair away from my neck, and rubbed some kind of chilly cream on it that made my skin tingle.  
“The lidocaine should make this easier.” Kaba patted my neck, and I heard the clink of the scalpel on the tray as he picked it up. “But you need to focus on something to dull the pain. I want you to keep talking, alright?”  
“Like in a dentist’s office?” I murmured into the sheet under my face.  
Andrea laughed. “Exactly. Okay, here we go. On three; one . . . two . . .”  
Pain sliced through my flesh, and I sucked in a breath.  
*I can do this. Just keep talking. Think of something stupid, and ramble.*  
“So, why Tiger?” I gasped, my hands gripping the sheet under me.  
Fingers pried at the throbbing part of my neck, and Kaba hummed a little tune under his breath, as if this were a regular day at work for him. “We needed a discreet way to say ‘the only Indian guy in town’ without alerting the authorities as to who was leaking all their classified information. My family came from Rajasthan, so Tiger seemed like a good code name. Sponge, please?”  
Andrea’s sneakers scuffed on the floor, and something plush daubed at my neck. “I still like ‘Google’ better.”  
“Google?” I shut both eyes as the harsh pinches intensified, a sensation like someone had dug a needle through my skin.  
Kaba laughed, and his normal American accent switched to a rather convincing Hindi lilt. “Google tech support, how may I help you sir or ma’am?”  
Despite myself, I managed to chuckle, though another stab caught me in the middle of it, and I ended up yelping instead. “That’s—*ow*—that’s pretty good, actually.”  
“It was either that, or 7/11.” Kaba’s shadow on the floor shrugged, and his voice returned to normal. “You’d be amazed how many people in the corporate world get thrown off by that kind of thing, and ELSAR is, or rather used to be, a private company. The suits live in their own make-believe world up in those offices, where everyone thinks like they do. Any idea that’s not workplace-appropriate can’t possibly exist, thus they never think to look for it. I’ve always found it weird that Americans get so worried about offending someone, yet have no problem bombing—ah *ha*, got you, you little bugger!”  
Something pulled loose from my angry pulsing skin, and the twinges subsided.  
Tex walked by, pushing something heavy on wheels, and I heard the slight hush of gas leaking from a valve.  
*Ka-whoosh.*  
An acetylene torch flickered to life, and the disgusting scent of burned blood filled the air.  
Fingers smoothed over the sore spots on my flesh, and a small dousing of liquid poured over it, before a soft patch of cotton was taped down.  
“Well, there you go.” Kaba peeled his gloves off with rubbery snaps. “You’re invisible again.”  
Sitting up, I eyed the puddle of aluminum, cobalt, and plastic on the floor between Tex’s boots, cooling with whisps of acrid smoke. How something so small had caused me such trouble was incredible, but I didn’t have time to dwell on it. Kaba already had most of his tools packed up, and Andrea worked to strip off her white apron, our five-minute window drawing to a rapid close.  
“Here.” Andrea dumped a backpack of clothes onto the weightlifter’s bench and gestured to the tangle of polyester and cotton with a brief wave as she slipped out of the cubicle. “Take whatever you want but be quick. They’re definitely going to be mad now that you just popped off their radar.”  
With the realistic concern of soldiers converging on our location, I unashamedly stripped back down to the simple bra and underwear that ELSAR had given me, selecting a pair of jeans, a gray V-neck T shirt, and a thin brown jacket with a hood. Normal clothes on my skin made me want to laugh, jump, shout, and cry all at once. I’d never thought about how good I had it in my old life in Louisville, with my closet full of shirts, my refrigerator brimming with food, and the ability to walk out my door at any time I so pleased. Just those few days in captivity, stuck in a bizarre limbo between the possibility of being grossly violated, or being dissected alive like a bug, had changed my entire perspective on such tiny matters. How good a worn-out pair of jeans felt, how wonderful to choose my own colors, and what a fool I’d been not to appreciate it before. The very air tasted different, not just from the melted tracker, but sweet in a new way, heady and vibrant.   
No one owned me but me.  
Smiling to myself, I snatched the old bolt-action rifle from where it leaned in the corner, convinced I would feel naked without one for the rest of my life.  
Tex stashed the acetylene tanks beside a dented toolbox and folded his arms as Kaba finished gathering his medical equipment. “I still think you should come with us. You’ve done a lot. No one would blame you, and we could use a good medic on our end.”  
Kaba stopped, and faced Tex, the two an odd juxtaposition, the beefy muscled Texan, and the short, skinny Indian. “There’s more I could do there.”  
*Is . . . is he going to go back?*  
Unable to keep my startled thoughts to myself, I straightened up. “You’re not serious, are you? What if they find out you helped me? What if Crow puts two-and-two together?”  
Kaba’s gaze flicked to the garage around him in silent appraisement of his chosen surroundings, and he let slide a resigned, weary sigh. “My father came to this country because he believed in it. I still do. We can’t let ELSAR turn this place, or anywhere else, into their personal laboratory.”  
“It’s a nice sentiment.” Tex’s eyebrow rose, and his usual bark softened to a more congenial, sympathetic tone. “But if your father were here, he’d tell you to know when to cut your losses. You could get out of this; you forge a pass, sneak back to Columbus, see your family again.”  
“And what about your pregnant wife?” Kaba spread his arms as if the answer to the question between them seemed obvious. “If she were here, she’d want you to do the same. My mother would certainly tell me to leave, to come home and work with my father instead. Yet here we both are, against our better judgments.”  
“Why?” I stood, rifle slung over one arm, and sized up the two men, trying to figure out what insanity would drive them to stay in the clutches of a regime so cruel that I would have thrown myself off a cliff before falling into its control once more.  
He searched the concrete between his shoes, like he was looking for an answer, and Kaba squared his shoulders in a renewed determination. “True bravery is being willing to do hard things for the good of others. It doesn’t matter if this happens in Black Oak, or Columbus, or anywhere else; if they can get away with violating the most basic human rights here, they can do it anywhere, including in our homes, to our families. If we run, we’ll just lead ELSAR right to them, but if we stay . . . if we stay, and we fight, then our country has a chance to survive.”  
His words coated the air like frost, and try as I might, I couldn’t find a way to poke holes in his argument. Like me, Kaba wasn’t from Barron County, had been sucked into the whirlpool of craziness that was this forgotten county because of the Breach, and yet he had decided to make this his personal struggle. I’d been thinking about myself, about my loneliness, my fear, my anger at the betrayal of my two best friends. He’d been here this entire time, sneaking boys and girls out of Crow’s prison cells, slipping information to the resistance, and dodging Auxiliary patrols, all for some unseen future that he might not live to celebrate. He’d adopted this country as his own, and along with the fierce mercenary who had snatched me out of the hands of the jailors, Kaba stood between Koranti, and the rest of the world.  
Our world.  
*My* world.  
“Guys.” The skinny man who had opened the door for the green van stuck his head in the ring of curtains. “Clock’s ticking. We’ll drop Tiger off at a safe point in the western district and ditch the van by the eastern park. Better get a move on; I can hear choppers coming.”  
We filed out to the big manhole in the center of the garage floor, and Kaba split off to climb into the van with the old driver and three other men.  
Just before he went to get in, Tex called to Kaba above the idling of the Volkswagen’s motor. “If we ever get out of this, come down to San Antonio and visit sometime. Chelsea makes some mean beer-battered chicken. You could bring your folks too.”  
Kaba beamed with a pearly grin and nodded from the running board of the vintage automobile. “I’m sure my mother would make enough *Sandesh* to feed the entire block. Here’s to hoping.”  
They backed out of the doors of the vacant fueling station, and as they did, a thought entered my mind. I hadn’t even thanked Kaba for taking my tracker out, or for playing such a big part in rescuing me. If he never returned from that cement monstrosity of a building, I never would. It bit at my soul in nibbles of guilt, and I scoured my heart for some kind of solution.  
*What would you do to save someone you love?*  
Like a thunderclap, the words of the stranger in the yellow chemical suit flashed through my head, along with the image of his powerful silver eyes.  
Chris. I’d left him at New Wilderness, all alone, completely unaware of who the traitor was in his midst. How many days had passed since Jamie had sold me out? A week? More? They could be under attack by the pirates, wiped out by Vecitorak, or even under a new regime if Jamie managed to launch a coup of her own. It didn’t matter what Chris had done; I couldn’t leave things like that. I had to go back, expose the truth, even if it cost me what little I had left.  
I had to save New Wilderness, so that New Wilderness could have a chance to save Barron County.  
Setting my jaw, I stuck my legs into the black recess of the manhole and followed the moldy iron rungs downward into the bowels of the underground.
