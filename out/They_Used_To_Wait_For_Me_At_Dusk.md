I live alone in the West Australian bush. A rough patch of land about two hours from the nearest town. A place where you wake to birds singing and your only neighbours are kangaroos. I moved out here ten years ago after my husband died, needing space, silence, and something resembling peace. I guess I got all three.

At first, it was just the birds. Magpies and kookaburras mostly. They’d gather around my veranda in the late afternoon, perching on the old wooden railing. I started tossing out scraps — bread crusts, leftover rice, whatever I had. They’d warble and sing as they ate; they were grateful. It felt… nice. I had company again.

Then came the kangaroos.

A big grey male showed up first, bold and calm. I named him Warren. His mob followed a week later — mothers with joeys, smaller males, all of them cautious at first, but always watching. Waiting. I left chopped carrots and old apples on the edge of the clearing, and they’d come closer each day. Before long, they were on my property like clockwork. Every evening at dusk.

Then the others came.

Wallabies. Emus. Birds I couldn’t name, bats in the trees, and something else — always just beyond the tree line. I never saw it, not clearly, but I’d catch glints of it, low to the ground, and the sense that something much larger was there. Not watching. Waiting.

I started spending most of my pension on animal feed. Grain, vegetables, seed — even fresh meat when the wedge-tailed eagles circled above. My fridge was emptier by the week, but I couldn’t stop. They were depending on me. And I couldn’t bear the thought of the clearing being empty again.

I didn’t feel lonely anymore, you see.

They’d gather right before sunset. Quiet, still, like they were attending a sermon. They didn’t make a sound unless I was late. Then the birds would shriek and circle. The roos would thump their tails. One time, Warren pawed at the door.

I laughed at first. Called him cheeky. But the next evening, I made damn sure I was on time.

Last month, the bills stacked up. I had to choose between feeding them and keeping the lights on. I chose them.

Last week, I ran out of feed completely.

That night, no animals came. The bush was silent. Not even the cicadas chirped. It was the most unnatural kind of quiet I’ve ever known.

I locked the door for the first time in years.

But the next night, they came back.

Only this time, they didn’t wait at the edge of the clearing.

They came right up to the house.

Warren stood on the veranda, staring through the window, his wide black eyes unblinking. The birds lined the gutters, the emus paced in the yard, and I swear — I swear to God — I saw something like a dingo, but taller, hunched and staring, just beyond the trees. Its eyes reflected by the moonlight.

I stayed inside and didn’t sleep.

They returned every night. Closer. Quieter.

On the third night, I heard the door creak.

It wasn’t the wind.

I tried to call for help, but the phone line was dead. No signal. Of course.

Tonight is the sixth night.

I’m writing this on the floor, hiding behind the couch. I haven’t eaten in two days. They don’t leave anymore. They just… watch. I can hear claws scraping the walls. Wings beating softly against the glass. Heavy breaths near the door.

Something is on the roof. Something heavier than a bird.

They want what I can't give them, what I won't give them.

They want me.

If anyone reads this — please don’t feed them.

Not every hunger is meant to be filled.
