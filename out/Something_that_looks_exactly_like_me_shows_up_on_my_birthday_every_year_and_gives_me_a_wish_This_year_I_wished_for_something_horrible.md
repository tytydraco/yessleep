Have you ever wondered what you look like from other people's perspective? Well I have, and on my 18th birthday an unassuming knock on my college dorm door satisfied my curiosity - and then some.



My young naïveté caused the assumption it was one of my roommates or perhaps the RA and so I opened the door without so much as an inquisitive "*Who's there?*" The knocker's identity brought out a dormant instinct harboured deep within me that I would wish on nobody.



It was *me*?



Something that looked identical to me stood on the crude-jokey pink doormat in front of our dorm wearing a wide, knowing smile and holding a tiny slice of candle-topped cake. It clearly noticed my sudden inability to form any words because it spoke, in my exact voice and cadence, to break the silence.



"*Happy Birthday! I'm glad we can finally meet in the flesh. Unfortunately, you have no birthday wishes saved, but there's always time for a first! So make those gears in your head turn and think of something!*"



An unseeable spark lit the candle as the final sound came out of its mouth whilst my mind, as requested, did work except not to think of a "wish". I slammed the door shut as it went to speak again out of nothing but horrifying instinct and spent the next few hours shell-shocked. Beyond the general impossibility of what I had seen, of what talked to me, I kept going back to the cherry on top of the disturbing pie.



There were no imperfections. No skin blemishes where there shouldn't have been any, no teeth ever so slightly mispositioned, no strands of hair out of place. Nothing at all that might have tipped myself or anybody else off to the fact that it was an impostor. I still refuse to refer to it by any words suggesting any level of humanity.



I spent the next few weeks in a haze of bewildered depression and terror. The few times I ventured out of my dorm room I was greeted by that same slice of cake. Rotten, withering and swarmed by flies but there and still lit nonetheless. The few times I talked to my dormmates about it, they said nothing was there. No cake, no candle. On the outside I was talking about a doppelganger and a piece of birthday cake they couldn't see, so they grew increasingly concerned with me as the weeks went on. Not wanting to be sent to some facility, I gathered the courage to begin ignoring it all. I stepped over the cake which burned with a slightly weaker flame every morning and evening and pushed the impostor out of my mind's sight. Things slowly improved and I began to turn a blind eye to the situation when my 19th birthday rolled around quicker than I had thought it would. 



And like it never left, that thing *tap-tap-tapped* on the front door again. I considered not opening. In fact, I was convinced that not opening was the only logical decision. But as I stared into my very own eyes through the peephole and saw the ominously full-of-possibilities flicker of the candle reflect into them, I twisted the handle and opened right up. 



"*Glad you decided it was worth it. First year is always so difficult*", it spoke in a soft tone before continuing, "*Like I was saying before I was so rudely cut off, Happy Birthday again! I'm pleased to be delivering your second wish. I hope you use it well given the way your first was spent. Wasting a wish is not something I'm able to tolerate, but you get a pass since I never got the chance to explain it all. Wish for anything that affects you, and only you, directly. Your use of whatever you wish for may affect other people, but your wish itself cannot. The lines are blurry when you're just getting started, so just look for the flame to disappear when you blow on it. Please note that your wish will be delivered exactly as described, but you are not able to influence the source of fulfilment. Enjoy!*" It then placed a slice of cake identical to the year prior on the doormat and walked away. 



"*Is that what I walk like? I really have to change that*" was the first thought in my mind. A nice ray of humorous sunshine amidst whatever the hell this was. 



That year I wished for money. Not quite fuck-you money, but enough to leave me comfortable. Except it was money stolen from the proceeds of a charity fundraiser. I'd spent a lot in the time between my wish being fulfilled and the eventual knock at the door of my newly bought downtown apartment one evening, and I even after all that's happened I still feel waves of guilt rush over me because of this. Despite my protestations of ignorance and innocence, I was handcuffed and following a short trial handed a sentence of 10 years in a damp, bare-walled cell. Many nights were spent ruminating over what I had asked for, what I had unwittingly done, and what I wanted to do to the thing that made it all happen. But despite my continued pleas of innocence throughout the year, there was just no rational explanation for hundreds of thousands of dollars of stolen cash ending up wired into my bank account, I simply played the game and I lost. End of story.



Except when it came to visit me that same year and we locked eyes between the metal bars that chained me, I had forgotten that not playing wasn't an option. I didn't speak a word, just stared and wondered whether my cell neighbours or the guards had the ability to witness the sight before me as it recited a new monologue. I didn't even care for the ridiculously terrifying fact that all of this was real, at least to me. The cake subsequently spent a few days sitting on the cold concrete floor of my cell, the flame burning into and out of existence as I glanced at it and then away before the whispering started. It sounded like a cacophonic buzz of young and old voices all willing me into making my wish. Into taking what was mine. They told me that I just had to be smarter. That now I knew there was a game to be played. To be *won*. 



I stood firm with my disinterest for quite some weeks. 



Until I was called to the inmate telephone to be given the news that my mother had been murdered. She was found inside an industrial dough mixer. They still hadn't recovered the mangled pieces of her trapped inside that metal grave when I got the call. 



Swinging wildly between states of unadulterated rage and grief, I stumbled my way back to my cell. 



I had an idea. 



The fainter-than-kindled light of the candle flame danced in the shadows as it to taunt me. As if to say, on behalf of something unexplainably real, "Look what you made me do". 



Crouching and lips pursed until I was low enough for the air to whistle out of my mouth and onto the flame, I finally gave in to the temptations of the whispers. 



"*I wish for my doppelganger to die a slow and painful death.*" 



And at that moment, as soon as the flame bent and promptly went back to the nothingness from whence it came, my suffering began. 

  
Even though I was granted a commutation of my sentence on compassionate grounds, I still find myself trapped.



My skin is gradually sloughing away, my arms and legs losing more function with each passing day, my mind slowly shutting down. I can barely type without frequent breaks.



They have run every test, called in every expert with even a passing interest in my condition, but the doctors still can't explain it. 



I can.
