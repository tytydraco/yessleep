Its been nearly a week since my encounter with the smiling man and things have been...weird, to say the least. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I work night shift at one of the McDonald's here in town. I'm front of store and drive thru. The day night after the encounter is when it all started. It was around 11 o'clock when my headset pinged to let me know someone was in drive thru.

I flicked on my headset. "Welcome to McDonald's are you using the app today?"

Nothing. No response. I waited a second then said, "Are you there?"

No response again. I was about to try again when a quiet voice came in over my headset. I didn't hear what it said at first. "Hi, I'm sorry, could you speak up, please? I'm having trouble hearing you." 

I waited a bit longer and the voice spoke again. All i could catch was the word 'smile'

I opened the drive thru window and looked out down the lane. There was a shadowy figure standing next to the speaker box. I rolled my eyes and flicked talk on my headset. "I'm sorry, but you can't walk through the drive thru. If you'd like to place an order, please come inside."

I stuck my head out the window again and the figure was gone. Just another night at McDonald's, i thought. 

My shift finished at 3 and I made my way out to my car. I sighed, turned the engine on and reversed. As I pulled my car around I noticed a person standing in the road under one of the street lights. They stood motionless, head tilted at an angle. I flicked my headlights on, lighting them up. It was Aiden. 

I gasped, a relief i didn't think possible flooding through me, In my joy, i fumbled with the car door, finally getting it open but when i looked up, he was gone. Confused, I thought maybe I had imagined it. It was pretty early after all and I was very tired. I put it down to sleep deprivation and went home. 

I had the next day off. I decided to go to the library and get some reading done. I find it easier to read there as its quiet and the atmosphere is more conducive to reading. I wandered the stacks, looking for just the right book. My taste for horror had someone diminished since the other night so i looked for the little symbol on the spine of the book that indicated a detective or mystery novel. I found one that took my fancy and pulled it from the shelf. Aiden stood on the other side of the shelf, staring through the gap. His eyes went wide and a sickening smile split his face in two. I yelped and stumbled back, throwing the book clean over the shelf behind me. I got to my feet and ran to the other isle. It was empty. I stood there, breathing heavily, hand on my chest. I all but ran from the library.   
  
Later that night, I lay on my bed, watching anime on Netflix. I should probably say i wasn't actually watching it. It was hard to focus on. I was actually totally spaced out, thinking about the last few days. My phone pinged. It was Peter. He had been there that night. Reluctantly, I opened the text. "Hey man have you u seen Aiden at all?" I quickly typed my response. "No, haven't heard from the police." The little dots popped up showing he was replying. "No, I mean have you seen him?"

I wasn't sure what to make of any of this. What did he mean? I replied no and waited. He typed for a few seconds before the reply came through. "I have." I sat up straight, suddenly more interested in the conversation. I typed my response. "You've seen him? Is he okay?"

"I keep seeing him standing in the distance."

I rapidly typed a response. "I've seen him too. At work and afterwards on the road."

My phone started ringing. Peter was requesting a video call. I accepted and his picture popped up. He looked exhausted. His eyes had heavy bags under them and he sat in a darkened room, lit only by a lava lamp to the side. He took a deep breath. "I think I'm going crazy, dude," his voice was shaking. "I'm seeing him everywhere."

"What is he doing when you see him?"

Peter exhaled. "He just stands there smiling at me. That same smile..."

Fear gripped my nerves. Ice slithered down my spine. 

"What do you mean smiling? Like the smiling man?"

Peter grit his teeth and nodded. It was obvious these events had shaken him. I was about to talk again when I noticed a vague shadow in the hall behind him. 

"Bro, is your mum listening in?"

He shook his head. "Nah, she's on a date with Cameron again...I swear that dude is the worst. Can you believe he..."

"There's someone in your hallway," I cut in.

He turned his head for a few seconds. "I don't see anyone."

"I swear, bro, there was someone there."

He turned back. "Must've just been.." He let out a sudden scream and his phone dropped from his hand. All i could see was the roof of his room. Shadows danced violently across it as he cried out. "Help...help its him I..."

"PETER!?" I yelled. I waited a few seconds. "God, please answer me."

The image on his camera moved as someone picked it up. A face appeared on the camera, hidden in the shadows cast by the lava lamp. A wide grin spread across their face. The call ended.
