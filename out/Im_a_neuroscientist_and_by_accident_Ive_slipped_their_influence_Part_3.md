Right after Priscilla and I proposed operating on their brains, we were told to wait and focus first on understanding Link 37, working together with my physicist friend Matthew.

After a week of research, we discovered that Link 37 had always been present around us. The cluster acted like a zipper, hiding it from our sight. But it wasn’t just the cluster; the brain pattern itself decided whether one could perceive Link 37 or not. This suggested the cluster was specifically designed to suppress intuition and the complete spectrum of conscious experience in humans.

Following the discovery, Link 37 was renamed Sense 37, as it became associated with future sightings and another plane of pure consciousness.

Sharing our findings with colleagues at the Human Brain Project yielded little response. A few began quiet investigations, but I warned them: Priscilla and I had crossed thresholds that couldn’t be uncrossed. They hadn’t. They were still green. If they went too far, they wouldn’t just glimpse the other dimension—they might invite something through. Or worse, they might leave something behind.

Some of the cognitive scientists clung to their sidelined outrage. Throughout the project, they had resented the control we had over neurological protocols. Now, that resentment bled into every conversation. It clouded their judgment.

One of them, found alive in Bolivia, had tried to remove the N-37 cluster from his own brain. Not with precision, but with desperation. The procedure should’ve killed him. Instead, it left him stranded. He couldn’t see the real world—only them. Only the dimension we weren’t meant to see. He gouged out his eyes days later. “Darkness is better than the Dark Dimension,” he reportedly said.

But even that didn’t help. He kept seeing them, without his eyes. Worse, he could taste and smell that place. His senses had shifted. His self remained, but his perceptions had moved on. He no longer experienced earthly smells, tastes, or sights. That dimension had rendered him senseless in the real world.

Disturbingly, some people cared more about the fact that we were going to operate on a dog’s brain than the possibility of an interdimensional parasite. Others demanded we livestream our next session for the sake of “transparency.” The absurdity of it revealed how unprepared they truly were.

That night, I went home and didn’t sleep. Something still lurked in the dimension. And something bad was going to happen.

I returned to the lab. A strange intuition pulled at me; something heavy, depressive.

When I crossed paths with Priscilla, she turned and asked in a low voice: *"Are you feeling something? Something awful… like something terrible is about to happen?”*

*“Exactly,”* I said. **“Something’s not right.”**

A day later, Matthew called. *"There’s a volunteer,”* he said.

The man didn’t want to be named. He was asking for money. His wife needed an immediate liver transplant. He didn’t have the funds.

Matthew knew we weren’t in the business of trading. But he also knew we needed someone. And the man’s story cut deep. We couldn’t ignore it.

After a long pause, Priscilla and I agreed. We weren’t buying him. We were helping. And—if we’re honest; we needed him.

He was brought in. And the moment he entered, that ominous feeling sharpened.

During testing, scanning, mapping, I heard him whisper: “Hush.” When I asked, he denied it. But I was certain I’d heard it.

He sat in silence. Eyes blank. Lost in thought. Likely thinking about her. I offered clumsy words of comfort. He managed a faint smile. Even that felt like a miracle.

He signed every waiver. Accepted every risk. Didn’t flinch. His devotion was absolute. If becoming something else meant she might live, he was ready.

The operation lasted 29 long hours. Midway, Priscilla said she saw black spots; coming into and out of existence.

But something failed. Our attempts to wake him didn’t work. He was breathing. His vitals were stable. But waking him became impossible.

Three hours later, we heard strange voices coming from the operating theater.

We rushed in. He was awake, speaking in a low, broken tone. His mouth moved in disjointed rhythms, as if echoing something else. Then he stopped—eyes locking onto ours. Confused and terrified. He remembered nothing.

Four days later, we introduced him to a dog. After a long, blank stare, he began to speak, describing what he was witnessing. He said he could hear them mourn, wail, and scream. Distant… yet near. He began to mourn too. His voice was haunting—sending chills through us, and even through himself. His eyes showed extreme fear and detachment, as if his mind was making him act against his will.

Suddenly, the dog began to howl. Right after his description, it howled. In perfect unison.

Moments later, his phone rang. His wife had died.

Old myths say dogs howl at death. But this felt like confirmation. Perhaps dogs don’t just sense death. Perhaps their minds stretch slightly beyond our dimension. Maybe they’re already entangled with whatever lies on the other side. Maybe that place isn’t parallel. Maybe it’s the future. **Or a collapsed strand of time, looping back.**

Something inside us fractured.

The creatures… they’re not just real. They’re tethered to us. Interwoven. With life. With death. They’re etched into our reality—hidden, but absolute.

Three days after her funeral, we moved him into Priscilla’s observation chamber.

When cats and dogs were brought in, he showed no fear. Claimed he no longer saw them—but could still hear the hushed voices. Said he understood them.

And then he began to mimic them. His voice shifted. Distorted. Warped. Not meant for a human mouth. But fluent. Unnervingly fluent.

The next morning, we called him back to the lab. We were preparing to operate on a dog. We believed he might sense what we couldn’t.

As the dog was brought in, Priscilla froze. She saw them—the fractures. The creatures. Again.

My stomach lurched, a deep lure of disgust overtook me. My blood spiked. And I collapsed.

In that unconscious state, I felt everything. The low hum. The brush of something against thought. I sensed Priscilla too; her mind, fragile and exposed. And in that moment, I saw them. Truly saw them. Perhaps I had entered the very dimension, while unconscious.

It tore something primal from me. And I realized how brave Priscilla had been. Holding onto their sight wasn’t easy. Their presence sent shivers through every cell of me.

When I woke, fully, they were gone. As always. But they had been real. My awareness had touched theirs. That wasn’t just knowledge. That was revelation. My consciousness had risen; just slightly, on par with theirs.

The dogs were taken away. The volunteer collapsed into a seizure.

Later, we reviewed the footage. His final words echoed through the static—barely words, but undeniable:

*“Hhhhuuusshhh… sshhh… hhhh…seaaaa…hus…huh…huuuuusshhh…”*

When he woke, we asked him what they were saying.

His answer left me paralyzed:

**“Don’t you think we’re cute?”**
