I am a biological engineer. I had my life in order and was living a peaceful life. I had a wife and a child. I worked at a pharmaceutical company that paid me $145,000 a year. My life felt like a dream.

Until that day.

I was driving home with my family after a vacation. Everything happened so suddenly—the headlights of a massive truck coming toward us, the sound of a horn, screams… and then I lost consciousness.

When I woke up, doctors were standing around me. Most of my body was wrapped in bandages, and I was in pain. According to the doctors, my survival was a miracle. I was the only one who survived the crash.

I stayed in the hospital for a few weeks. On the day I was supposed to be discharged, I didn’t expect to be greeted by police officers. They told me that the company I worked for had been involved in illegal drug trafficking. Everyone who worked there was interrogated, including me.

After my innocence was proven, I returned home. But my life had been turned upside down. I no longer had a family or a job. I was completely alone.My savings were running out. I applied to countless jobs, but no one wanted a man who had worked for a company involved in drug trafficking.

When the envelope that would change my life arrived, I was seriously considering applying to McDonald’s as a cashier. When the doorbell rang, I ran to the door in excitement. Had one of my applications finally been accepted?

“Are you Mr. Wilshere?” the mailman asked.

“Yes,” I replied eagerly and took the envelope. I closed the door and hurriedly opened it.

“Wilshere Johnson. You have been accepted for the job. Please come to XXXX to sign the necessary documents.”

For certain reasons, I won’t tell you this location.

Of course the envelope was longer than that. But i don't want to steal your time with details.

The envelope felt suspicious. There was no company name on it, no sender information. But it couldn’t be worse than McDonald’s, right? So I decided to go.

The location was a small building. When I entered, there was a tall man in a suit sitting on one of the chairs in the lobby. When he saw me, he stood up and walked toward me.

“Are you Mr. Smith?”

I nodded.

He handed me a stack of documents. Long story short, I would be working at a secret experimental facility. The pay was unbelievably good—$2.5 million a year. I thought about it for a moment. I had nothing else in my life. No friends. No family.

I took the documents and signed several confidentiality agreements. The man in the suit put me into a car. The windows were completely blacked out, and I couldn’t see outside. After a while, I fell asleep. When I woke up, we had arrived at the facility.

This is the story of how I entered the Laboratory— to the deepesf pit of hell.

The Laboratory is a massive underground facility. It consists of five sections, each with multiple floors. These sections are called “Levels" among the employees. Let me briefly explain them to you.

Level 1:

This level focuses on small insects and pests. You’ll usually find new employees here. These workers believe the entire facility consists only of Level 1.

Level 2:

Larger animals are experimented on here. They are killed and revived. Experiments are conducted to observe how different events affect different species. The employees here are aware of how large the facility truly is.

Level 3:

This is where things really begin. New animal species are created here, usually by combining different creatures. If you work here, you are considered special.

Level 4:

Experiments are conducted on humans at this level. Homeless people with no families, prisoners sentenced to life—these are the subjects. Traits of different creatures are injected into humans, and entirely new beings are created from the results. I worked on this level and below.

Level 5:

There are only rumors about this level. I don’t know what it takes to work there, or how employees are selected. According to the rumors, supernatural beings are created on this level. I have never met anyone who worked there.

From the outside, you might compare this place to Area 51. That comparison crossed my mind as well. But this place has a different name. There’s no way for us to know if it is really Area 51.

Let me tell you about some of the rules.

First of all, leaving the city is forbidden. You must get permission from the company to do so.

I don't know if i mentioned before, you must never talk about these experiments to anyone.

Meeting new people is forbidden too. You may only interact with company employees or people you already knew beforehand.

If you break any rule, you will be warned or punished depending on the severity of your mistake. There are two types of punishment.

The first is lifetime employment at the company. If you receive this punishment, you will be declared dead to the outside world. The company even arranges a funeral in your name. Everyone except the company believes you are dead. From that moment on, you live inside the facility.

As for the second punishment… well, you are erased. Literally erased. You, everyone who knows you, and every trace of your existence in the past are wiped out. It’s as if you never existed at all.

Now let me tell you about one of my first assignments here.

Case 1: The Immortal Cockroach — “Frankenstein”

When I first entered the laboratory, I reviewed the files I was given in my office. That’s when I realized how insane this place truly was.

The files explained my first task. We were to conduct experiments on a cockroach, adding new traits to it in an attempt to make it immortal. My colleagues and I thought it was a joke.

It wasn’t.

With the help of professionals, we succeeded. It took us tons of cockroaches. But we made a cockroach immortal.

It was resistant to posions and radiation. It could breathe underwater like a fish. It could regenerate itself after physical damage. It was resistant to extreme heat and extreme cold. As an experiment, we crushed it. The insect flattened against the ground like a piece of paper—then slowly returned to its original shape. When it started moving again, my colleagues and I were filled with pride.

We decided to name it. Our unanimous choice was the name of a famous immortal: Frankenstein.

We tore it apart, burned it, melted it with acids. Every single time, Frankenstein managed to return to its original form.

Eventually, they took Frankenstein away from us. I have no idea where they put it. Most of the work on Level 1 involved small insects like this, but Frankenstein was our greatest achievement on that level.

Anyway, my time here is up for now. As I said, this is a secret facility, and they wouldn’t be happy knowing I talked about these things. I’ve dealt with a lot of security stuff and some proxy, so I don’t think they’ll find me easily—but just in case, I constantly change cities.

As you can tell, I live a life on the run now.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll answer as best as I can.
