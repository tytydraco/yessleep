Hey everyone. I’m not really sure where to go or who to talk to about this. I don’t think anyone would believe me, and honestly, I wouldn’t blame them. So I thought I’d come to Reddit. Let’s face it, the unbelievable lives here.

I used to have a friend named Maisy Jones. We were in school together, primary school, for those of you familiar with the Scottish system. This would’ve been in the last few years, when we were about eleven or twelve.

I didn’t have many friends back then. I don’t think I cared much, really. Maisy didn’t either, which is probably why we got along. She was quiet, always sitting alone at lunch, scribbling away in her sketchbook while the world spun around her like she wasn’t even part of it.

For some reason, I found that comforting. I wanted to be her friend, even if she hardly ever talked. I would sit beside her, rambling about my day, and she’d just nod or offer the smallest smile. It was enough. It felt good to have someone there, even in silence.

One afternoon, I asked her what she was drawing. She usually kept it hidden, pulling the book to her chest if anyone got too close. That day, she looked up and said it was “something happening but not here, not now.”

At the time, I didn’t get it. Honestly, I don’t think she did either.

But there was one moment I saw what she was working on. A single drawing, just long enough to burn itself into my memory. It was an eyeball. Incredibly detailed for someone her age. From the corner of the eye, this small white wormlike thing was wriggling its way in. The eye was crying on one side, but from the other, where the creature entered, there was blood. Just enough to turn your stomach. I remember how vivid it was. Almost too vivid.

I didn’t think much of it after that. I was just trying to enjoy what was left of primary school before heading into high school. Maisy was going to a different school, still nearby, but at that age, being in different schools might as well mean different worlds.

I stopped seeing her around. I forgot about her, really. I feel sick admitting that. But life moved on. High school happened. I made new friends, had a decent time, and eventually got accepted into university to study biomedicine. I worked hard for that. I was proud of where I had gotten.

Then some things started to happen that I can’t explain.

My university is fairly prestigious, one of the top in Scotland. I won’t say which one, because honestly, I’m scared of what might happen if I do. During one of our modules, we had the opportunity to visit a biomedical tech company. They were working on alternative methods for boosting human health and immunity. The kind of stuff that sounds like science fiction.

I was interested. It sounded useful, and in this field, every bit of experience matters.

The presentation was in this massive hall with rows of seats cascading down toward the stage. I got one of the front seats. Right there, practically face to face with the demo. A girl sat on stage, long brown hair, still and composed, waiting. A man in a lab coat came out, one of those overly enthusiastic types who’d obviously been trained to sound friendly and passionate.

He brought out a jar.

I don’t know why I focused on it so much. Maybe it was instinct. Maybe something in me already knew. It was labeled, but I couldn’t see what was inside. I didn’t care about what he was saying until one sentence snapped me out of my thoughts.

He said their research revolved around genetically modified parasites. They were using them to enhance health, cure diseases, even improve physical performance. He opened the jar and pulled out a small white worm. It was pure white, almost glossy, like a pearl. And it hit me.

I was back on that bench, next to Maisy, staring at her sketchbook. The worm he held looked exactly like the one in her drawing. Same size. Same shape. The same quiet horror.

Before I could process it, the demonstration began.

He placed the worm at the corner of the girl’s eye. Just like the drawing. The thing squirmed, pushing its way inside. She cried. A tear rolled down one cheek, and blood followed from the other. It was exact. Every detail, identical to what Maisy drew.

And no one else reacted.

The audience was amazed, full of excitement, whispering about innovation and breakthroughs. I sat frozen. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t speak. I wanted to scream, but I didn’t know what to say. How could she have known?

How could an eleven-year-old girl have drawn this exact moment?

The girl on stage wiped her face clean like nothing had happened. The presentation continued. They listed the benefits of the parasite, how it bonded with the host, adapted to their immune system. But I wasn’t listening. I couldn’t.

Eventually, the crowd began to leave. I stayed behind for a moment, still processing. That’s when I noticed something. The girl, the “test subject” as they kept calling her, started twitching. Just a little at first. Her right arm gave a small jerk, then her shoulder. No one seemed to notice. But I watched her.

The twitching grew worse.

I left as quickly as I could. I couldn’t watch anymore. As I stepped out of the room, I heard a thud. Someone behind me screamed.

I didn’t turn back.

It’s only been a few hours since this happened. I’m writing this now, hoping someone out there knows something. I don’t know if Maisy was warning me, predicting this, or if she was part of something else entirely.

All I know is that something is very wrong within the biomed field.
And I need to find her.
