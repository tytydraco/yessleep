For someone who has been living in the city their whole life, moving to a small town from New York to Colorado had a huge impact on my life.

Not only do I have to start over and make new friends, but I also have to get used to an entirely new environment.

I hated everything about Colorado at first.

But after a while, I started to get used to it and started to enjoy the amazing views the mountains would show.

The more I got off my phone, the more I would realize how very few tourists ever passed the area I lived in.

I never understood why as this was such a beautiful place, I mean how could someone not wanna live here?

I would think that thought to myself every time the mountains would show.

Everything started to seem perfect in Colorado until "he" came along.

"He," is what he refers to himself as if you call him anything else... let's just say referring to him by his name would be the best if you like to keep your sanity.

As far as I can tell He came to my town 2 years ago in the wintertime.

I first met He while lying in bed on my phone scrolling through Tiktok which was all I did back then, I mean after all, I was only 14 at the time.

Christmas was tomorrow so I couldn't sleep much as it was around 2 am.

I started to get thirsty so I went for a cup of water, and that's when I saw He for the very first time.

I stood frozen when I first noticed him.

My kitchen, living room, and dining room are all connected so noticing He in the corner of my living room wasn't a struggle at all.

I don't know what was worse when noticing He.

The fact He was tall enough to reach my living room ceiling, which is around 12 feet, or the fact his face was very distorted.

His face was very dark but you could see his wide eyes with small red dots in the middle of his eye sockets and his very very sharp teeth.

For a moment I thought I saw a droplet of blood drop out of his mouth, he looked to be staring into my soul.

I think the worst thing about He, wasn't the fact his facial features were very inhumane and terrifying, but the fact there was another face behind his first layer.

I knew there was, I could see it through his eye sockets.

I never had a good look at them, nor did I ever want a look at them.

With a blink of an eye, he runs towards me at a speed so high you could say he ran faster than the speed of light.

It is then I realize I couldn't scream, move, nor make a reaction.

I was frozen with fear, the fear of knowing this was not a dream.

This was real...

I never spoke of this incident to anyone as it terrified me to my core, my last memory of that night was He staring at me 3 inches from my face for what felt like 5 minutes.

In reality, it was only for about a minute.

I ended up blacking out and waking up the next morning in my bed, as if it never happened. 

I encountered He 3 more times after that, but only in dreams.

He can make dreams, and allusions seem real, almost to the point you are convinced you are insane.

The only possible way to know you are dreaming is to be very observant of your surroundings.

He can make things seem extremely real, to the point that pain and emotions are so real to you that it's hard to tell if it actually is or if it is all in your head.

But all I know is He can't make everything perfect, a slight glitch in a wall or a slight change in your house is a huge give away He has put you in one of his allusions.

The worst part is when you are in He's allusional fever dreams, they can last up to days.

Sometimes, your day seems completely normal, even your nights.

Eventually, however, the allusions begin, and they are terrifying and brutal.

Things so bad it would sound like something from a messed up little kid's mind.

Only one of my dreams He made an allusion on me.

He won't just make allusions happen to you for no reason.

You have to give him a reason, the main one being you didn't refer to him by his name.

Ever since He introduced himself to me, He just follows me around randomly.

It isn't common to see He anywhere outside the season winter, but sometimes He will make exceptions.

It always gets annoying to refer to him as He constantly, there could have been other names but He chose a name that gets annoying to say and hear after a while.

He never spoke which was the worst part about him, speaking to him would trigger a response but never in words.

Speaking to He though is a death wish however, acknowledging his existence is a death wish itself.

How could you not though, He is basically a demon or monster.

He is the reason many people have gone missing in my town recently.

He is the reason I barely can sleep now.

Something has been wrong recently though, I am aware I am in his allusion but something is wrong.

Why has nothing bad happened yet?

It has been a week and nothing strange has happened.

The only way to escape is to die, and I don't mean just die but die in a very traumatic way.

As I wait for my bus stop in the feezing cold I notice something odd, a van is approaching me and then stops right in front of me.

A strange man rolls down the window and stares at me.

I tried to speak to him but before I could I felt intense pain in the back of my head and then I hear the sound of metal hitting something hard like concrete.

"ARE YOU STUPID, THE KID IS STILL STILL CONSCIOUS HIT HIM AGAIN!"

I hear a man in a very low and raspy voice say.

After the man says that I black out.

I wake up in a basement, I have a splitting headache. 

I realize He's allusion is starting, He always tried to warn me of this.

He never spoke, however, so I never knew what He was trying to say. 

My dreams when He was in them always meant something, I guess the chains and baseball bat finally made sense.

It wasn't until I gained my vision back I realized all the bodies around me. 

All looking to be around my age or less.

The smell was putrid too, it was so bad I almost hurled on the floor. 

As I was about to puke on the floor, the door opened to the basement. 

The door was a metal door, and it looked to be heavily locked to keep anyone inside of the basement to stay inside.

The man spoke to me.

"Austin right? That's your name isn't it," the man said.

I refused to speak to him out of intense fear, being kidnapped was my number 1 fear.

The man strangely didn't say anything else to me but just stared intensely at me. 

He then goes over to little room in the corner and unlocks it, inside is a whole weaponry of tourture items.

He pulls out a saw and holds it close to my neck.

"ANSWER ME, WHEN I SPEAK TO YOU AUSTIN, IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?"

Something wasn't right about this, I notice his eye slightly glitch out of his socket for a very quick second. 

You would be able to miss it without doubt if you weren't paying very close attention. 

"Ye- yes sir." I answered with a studder.

"Good, now tell me, is it so hard to use your manners?" The man said in a mannerly voice.

"No sir" I answer knowing very well this will end with me leaving without my life.

I just pray this is an allusion, I mean it has to be right?

I saw the man's eye glitch out of his socket for a split second.

I was so into my thoughts I didn't hear the mans other questions.

He stares at me with a expression he should not of been showing giving what he was about to do.

He walks behind me and unwraps my hand from the chains.

For a moment my hand felt numb from being chained to a metal chair for God knows how long.

That feeling was shortly lasted as a felt felt home grab my hand and slam it on the desk. 

I try moving my hand but it is no use, a grown man to a young teen.

For a moment I felt nothing, then a sharp pain and a sharp burning sensation as i look down at my hand. 

I counted 4 fingers.

The man just laughs as I cry out in pain.

This lasted for days until finally there was only 1 finger left.

One mess up and I lost a finger, my last mess up he used a blow torch.

I just wanted it to end.

Finally I ask him why he is doing this and why he won't just finish what he originally planned to do, which was obviously kill me. 

It wasn't until I asked the question he stopped everything he was doing and stared about me.

I slowly watched him transform from human into He.

He then smiles at me, and in a blink of an eye he is inches near my face.

He removes his face to reveal my own face but distored.

Blood shot eyes that seemed to be watery as if I am about to cry.

Teeth extremely long and sharp, and scratches all over my face.

Finally with a snap of he's fingers, the chains release from my body and arm and I get up and back up. 

I then realize something, the pain in my hands is gone.

All my fingers are back, and then I look up and He is gone.

In his place He once stood lies a note. 

When I pick up the note it reads, "You are."

I couldn't read the 3rd word, it was just a letters.

Then I heard He talk to me for the first time.

All I hear is one phrase repeating.

"Kill yourself, none of this is real."

Non stop over and over, all I wanted was for this to end and to return back to the real world.

I found  a rope in the weaponry room and tie it into a noose and hang it up.

I carry the heavy metal chair and place it underneath the rope.

I put my head through the noose and jump.

I can't breath and my life starts to flash right before my eyes.

This has already happened once, and it feels so real happening again.

Now that I think about it, I never seemed to of had very many friends.

People seemed to avoid me my whole life except my parents, family and doctors.

I never understood why I only could see he, and no one else could nor experience the allusions He did on me.

For someone who hated speaking, he always made me think someone was trying to speak to me in my head, I would always hear voices.

The voices have said very bad things before but they are never been this bad before, almost as if the voices are trying to tell someone to save me. 

It's weird too, it's like I can feel someone trying to pull me down from the rope, they sound like my parents.

They keep screaming at me, "SNAP OUT OF IT AUSTIN, YOU ARE IN ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR EPISODES"

I know better, it is just He tyring to keep me in his allusion.

He already prevented me from escaping the first allusion, it feels like I have been trapped in this allusion for years but I know better.

Don't worry mom, dad, your son is coming home very soon.

Now that I look at that 3rd word again on note He left me, I think it spells out schizophrenia backwards.
