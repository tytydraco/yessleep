We returned to Nick’s place. It’d been a couple of long nights, but things were looking better. The Yearwalker kid was being moved to an apartment complex, where it’d be easier to keep tabs on him. It’d give us more time to look towards the real issue – Allie. The person, turned thing, turned other thing. Nick and I had an agreement. We’d deal with this one last problem, and then we were heading to Dallas. Ride off into the sunset.

Maybe it was a stupid plan to begin with. Maybe we were just delaying the inevitable, or moving the goal posts. I knew for a fact that Nick was a bit hesitant about leaving Tomskog to begin with. That town was as much a part of him as his arm, or his pink sunglasses.

But after the setback at Digman’s ranch, Allie and her cohorts were going to have to lay back for a while and recuperate; if she was capable of making that kind of decision with a conscious mind. That was still up for debate.

 

For a couple of weeks, we stayed behind and tried our best to find new leads. We figured there ought to be whispers around the police station, but according to our insider, Charlie, it was business as usual. The only thing that’d changed was an increased surveillance budget on Digman and his nephew. Not a word about Allie, or the strange people she associated herself with.

It was the beginning of October when Nick came up with an idea of his own. That instead of trying to hunt her down, we could try our best to lure her out. Only problem was – he had no idea what we were dealing with. Neither did I, to be honest. Sure, I had an uncomfortable truth of my own hiding in my stomach lining, but I didn’t understand it. It’s like… having a kidney doesn’t make me a doctor. It just means it’s there.

“We should get a hold of that guy again,” Nick blurted out. “The tall, weird guy.”

He didn’t need to say the name out loud. I knew exactly who he was talking about.

 

Nick was talking about a guy named Evan. I say ‘guy’ in very loose terms, because there was no telling what kind of creature or identity we were dealing with. ‘Evan’, as he was called, was something we’d run into a couple of times before. He seemed helpful enough when need be, but there was no denying that this was a thing that was far more than human. Or less than, if you prefer. But he might have insights on hunting down Allie.

It wasn’t that hard to get an idea of his whereabouts. There’d been a handful of sightings, and Charlie at dispatch had continuous updates whenever something new popped up. Problem was – it was all sightings in passing. There was nothing permanent. He was always on the move. Still, we figured he might agree to see us if given the opportunity.

That’s what we banked on, at least.

 

We ran into Evan by mistake. We’d been driving around checking a couple of locations where he’d been spotted, and decided to stop for a gas station hot dog and a coffee. There was this old park bench by the side entrance of the gas station where Nick and I sat down, and all of a sudden – there was Evan.

It was hard to tell what he looked like. He was like a moving pile of blankets, all haphazardly sown together. It looked more like something you’d cover your car in to protect it from rain rather than clothes to wear. There was even crime scene tape used to keep it together. The sun had just started to set, casting a long shadow from an already tall man across the table.

He sat down with a thud. Despite me and Nick both sitting on the same side, we could feel the weight shift. This was like sitting face to face with a small car.

“*Officers*,” he said.

His voice was an uncomfortable clicking purr – like a cat and a centipede had an unfortunate baby.

“Evan,” I said. “Keeping tabs on us?”

“*Yes*.”

 

There wasn’t much more to it. I gave Nick a curious look, and he shrugged back at me. This was my show – he was just there for the ride.

“We need to find a dangerous woman,” I said. “She has something terrible inside her, and we need deal with it.”

“*Why?*” he asked.

“Because someone needs to. People will get hurt.”

“*Yes.*”

I couldn’t see his face under the layers of cloth, but I could see it tilt to the side. He was listening – waiting.

“Yes?” I scoffed. “So we don’t want that.”

“*I don’t understand.*”

 

Nick put his arms on the table, ready to play the bad cop.

“That bitch was ready to put the teeth to your little Digman guy,” he said. “Slurp him up like leftover kimchi. If you don’t want your little pet boyfriend to end up on a Sunday platter, I suggest we work together.”

“*What’s kimchi*?” Evan asked.

“It’s like an old cabbage fist-fighting a radish salad,” Nick said. “Focus. You helping us or not?”

“*Yes.*”

Nick leaned back with a groan. He gave me a tired look and adjusted his sunglasses. It was my cue to pick up the conversation.

“Alright,” I said. “Let’s talk.”

 

Evan told me there were things he could do to help us find her, but it might be risky. He would need bait, and the best bait around was, sadly, me. I was already infected – but it was stable. I could still feel it, and in the moments where my mind drifted I’d feel little tendrils make their way up my throat; parting my lips. I’d begun to sleep with a plastic cover over my pillow, or else there’d be these awful chemical stains in the morning. But this was also what would bring Allie out of hiding – the promise of a great meal. But it wasn’t that easy. Evan had a plan to make me more, as he put it, appetizing. But he warned me – it wouldn’t be pleasant.

A couple of nights later, we drove out to a hill outside of town. It was a starlit night with a swift October chill cutting straight through my jacket. I could feel something inside of me curl into the pit of my stomach, huddling for warmth. Nick and I had to make our way up a slithering gravel path on foot, per Evan’s instructions.

We found him at the top of the hill with a telescope. If I didn’t know any better, it almost looked like a picnic.

 

“We lookin’ at stars tonight?” Nick said. “I can spot the big dipper, you know. But it’s more like a big spoon.”

“*No spoons,*” said Evan. “*You. Come here.*”

He pointed at me. I stepped forward, and he moved away from the telescope.

“*I need to know how far gone you are,*” he continued. “*Tell me what you see.*”

I looked back at Nick. He crossed his arms, giving Evan an uneasy look. This was far out of both our comfort zones. Then again, it was just a telescope. Telescopes didn’t bite.

I walked over and leaned in, making sure not to touch the dials. At first I didn’t spot anything in particular, but after I found the right angle I could clearly see a celestial body. Something large, and brownish red.

“Hold on,” I said. “Is that Jupiter?”

“*What do you see?*” Evan asked.

 

It was a difficult question. As soon as the planet came into focus, my eyes would blur. I’d have to blink away the moisture. Maybe it was the cold, or maybe it was something different. It wasn’t just moisture, it was more like tears – like my body shivered out of *fear* rather than cold. Stepping away, I took a deep breath. There were lines of tears streaming down my face, but I didn’t understand why. I sniffled.

“You alright?” Nick asked.

“Yeah, I don’t know why this… hold on,” I said. “This is weird.”

I stepped back, looking again. It was clearer now, as if something inside me dared to look a little closer. It was definitely Jupiter, I could see the storms and swirls. But there was something else. Right there, in the middle of it.

“Is that an eye?”

 

My stomach turned upside down and inside out. I had a violent physical reaction, falling backwards and heaving out my dinner and lunch into the dry autumn grass. It was nothing like the times I’d been sick before, this was a single painful cramp-like movement. It felt like the infection inside me was trying to make a run for it, bringing all my organs along. Nick dove forward, checking on me, but I could barely hear him over my own beating heart. Every time I blinked, there was this red discoloration on the inside of my eyelids. A fading image, like I’d stared at the sun too long.

There was an eye, staring back at me from the inside of my head.

“*It is an activator,*” Evan explained. “*It is unpleasant.*”

I couldn’t say anything. My body was a tight knot of cramps and stomach acid. Nick was barking at Evan to do something, but he just stood there. I had this intense shudder coming down my spine in waves with every blink, as if an unheard sound resonated with me.

Then I passed out.

 

I woke up in the back of Nick’s car. Nick and Evan were waiting outside. They looked like they’d been there for a while. The moment my eyes opened, I had a massive headache. It took me a moment to realize it was from the stench. The entire car had this intense chemical odor. Turns out that thing in my stomach had gone absolutely berserk. Evan and Nick hadn’t noticed I was awake yet, so I just lay there – waiting for my head to stop spinning.

“*It has progressed*,” Evan said. “*It will progress further*.”

“Is she gonna be okay?” Nick asked.

“*She will see a lot of things*,” he answered. “*I will help*.”

And with that, Evan got up and left. Nick shrugged, as if expecting something more tangible. Then he checked on me, noticing I was awake.

“Sorry about the car,” I wheezed.

“Tell that to Tommy, he’s the one who’s gonna fix it,” Nick sighed. “Come on, you need a shower.”

 

I got back to Nicks’ place, took a shower, and crashed on the couch. It was not just an uneasy sleep; it felt like an uneasy grasp on the world itself. Like I was having trouble differentiating dream from reality, and awake from unconscious. Like the worst fever dream I’d ever had. I’d wake up gasping for air, only to realize I was still sleeping. I’d find myself on my knees in the bathroom, heaving up whatever remained of my stomach – and I’d dream of it, at the same time. I’d forget where I was, and what I was doing.

Even in my mind, I’d refrain from looking up. In my half-dream state, I’d see that red planet when I looked out the window. It’s as if my eyes were stuck in that telescope, and I’d see that spot of red in the distance in perfect clarity. And in the middle of it, among the swirling storms, I’d see that red eye – looking at me.

But it wasn’t just looking at me, it was looking through me. It was concerned. Like a mother hen looking at a child unborn; aching to peck at the broken shell. To help. To plead.

 

In the morning, I was sicker than I’d ever been. I had a fever, and my eyes were swollen. I couldn’t close them properly. Nick was screaming at someone on the phone one moment and throwing me into a bathtub the next. I remember him apologizing as he stripped me down and covered me in ice water. It was a surreal experience – like it wasn’t really happening to me. It felt more like watching him do it to someone else, but through my eyes. He brought these big bags of ice from the supermarket and poured it all in, but I couldn’t feel a thing.

I remember looking at him and trying my best to figure out if I was dreaming or not. I couldn’t raise my hand to poke him on the nose, making me consider that maybe this was real life. Had it been a dream, nothing could’ve stopped me.

“I don’t care what that fucker says,” Nick said. “You’re one bad cough from an ambulance.”

I finally managed to move my hand, touching his nose with a ‘boop’. It felt like the air itself was jelly.

“Perv,” I said. “You’re a perv.”

Nick buried his face in his hands. I almost recognized it as relief. Maybe I was getting better.

 

At some point, I fell asleep, but I was still in that room. Nick was gone, but the room remained. The light was different. There was a hole in the wall, and strange trees outside. Evan was there, leaning against a broken doorway. There was an eerie silence in the air, like there was supposed to be crickets outside – but there weren’t.

“This is what remains of somewhere else,” he said.

His voice was different. Smoother, almost human. He was a bit smaller, and dressed in a poncho rather than a makeshift blanket fort.

“You can come and go as you want?” I asked. “Or are you from here?”

“No,” he said. “There is a lot of me to go around.”

“That’s fucked up.”

“Yes.”

 

I looked out the crack in the wall. A starlit night. I knew the red planet was out there. The red eye. I felt my stomach acid swirl.

“Normal people don’t see it,” he continued. “But those who do see it a lot.”

“It feels like it’s alive,” I said. “I hate it.”

“It is worried about us,” Evan said. “Thinking there is something wrong.”

“Is there?”

Evan took a few steps forward, leaning out through the crack in the wall. The texture of the ceramic tiles looked different. Older.

 

“Imagine the egg of a bird,” he said. “But it takes longer to hatch than it should. And finally, it moves. But you are not seeing the feathers. No beak. You start to worry if your egg is the bird you expected.”

“Snakes lay eggs too,” I said. “And turtles.”

“Or maybe the egg is dead,” Evan said. “Maybe something else lives in there.”

“I’d be worried too,” I said. “So what exactly are we in this metaphor. Are we the egg, or what’s inside?”

“Neither,” said Evan. “We’re what lives in the bumps in the shell.”

“Egg shells don’t have bumps. They’re smooth.”

“Not if you look close enough.”

 

I got out of the bath. The water was long gone. It was a pleasant night – not too cold, not too warm. I joined Evan at the crack of the wall, looking out. In the distance, there was a tree. It was larger than anything I’d ever seen. Tall enough for the branches to reach the sky, as if trying to pluck the moon like low-hanging fruit.

Except it wasn’t a tree. It was a muscle, with branches being white, living tendrils. A smell tickled my nose – the same smell I’d felt back in the car. My smell. Veins as wide as highways. Cuts and bruises as tall and wide as parking garages. Every heartbeat sending pulses of blackened blood, as thick as waves on an upwards ocean. It never stopped moving. Squirming. *Reaching*.

“She’s nothing,” Evan said. “She’s Blameless.”

“That’s not nothing,” I gasped.

“Perhaps there’s a good reason to worry.”

Something inside me resonated with that thing. I could feel how satisfied it was. It’d wanted this; to become something whole. It wanted to bring it all together. It wanted to reach through the cracks in the shell. It wished for it. It wished for it every moment, of every day.

A wish upon a red, weeping star – desperate to look the other way.

 

I woke up screaming. I’d crawled out of the bath, curled up into a corner, and clawed at the walls like a cornered animal. Nick had wrapped a blanket around me and held me like a child, shushing me. His arms were stained with acid burns, and there were spots of his blood on the walls. And yet, there he was.

Exhaustion took hold as my lungs gave out. I couldn’t scream anymore, and settled into a forced, wheezing breath.

“It’s alright,” Nick whispered. “You’re awake. It’s okay.”

I couldn’t speak. I could feel that muscle in the dark space beyond. Clawing at the world, begging to reach through. And there were so many things looking to help. I could feel them everywhere – inside and out.

That’s what Allie would want, given the Yearwalker’s wish. A slip of the red eye, and a wink at something aching to break through. Something horrifying, but Blameless, through countless worlds beyond.

How could I do anything but scream?

 

I blinked in and out of consciousness. I dreamt of splinters of worlds long dead. Fields of blue sunflowers hiding little houses of lies and flies.

I saw people dancing around a winter lake, singing in forgotten tongues. The circle of dance a symbol for the yearly trot of the Earth around the Sun. It was a way to speak a word in a manner that something impossible could understand – and the word not spoken was ‘Wish’.

I’d see struggles and pain, screams and desperation. Empty people bringing silence. Thousands of lives, all at the same beach of black sand at the end of hope and things undone. Cruelty at every turn, at every corner. Uncaring, inhuman, and true.

And through it all; inevitable pain and darkness. Except for a single voice, in the back of my mind. Something warm stroking my sweat-soaked hair, whispering.

“It’s okay,” it said. “You’ll be okay.”

 

When my eyes opened, I was in a warm bed. I was looking up at the ceiling as the morning light broke through a hazy window.

I felt something in my stomach. A resignation. The thing inside me had fought to take control, but it’d failed. Like the lady in the blue kaftan had said, it wouldn’t be the death of me. She’d been right. Instead, it lingered – like a wild animal cowed to submission.

I looked at my hand, willing a single white strand to protrude from my fingernail. It did, without protest. Control at last.

 

Nick was off in the corner, sleeping on a desk chair. He was gonna have a stiff neck, he was leaning at a really bad angle. He’d bandaged both his arms, and there were spots of red breaking through the fabric. I sat up. My clothes had been washed and dried. They were on the floor right next to me.

I could tell there’d been a struggle. There were buckets of something foul-smelling by the side of the bed. Several towels, all stained with blue. Empty plastic ice bags. There were a couple of belts on the floor – maybe Nick had to restrain me at some point.

I sat up. My hands were shaking. My body was so empty of nourishment that I was afraid to think of food. It felt like a hearty meal would hurt.

 

“You good?”

Nick looked up from his chair. He winced a little as he uncrossed his arms.

“Yeah,” I said. “Sorry about-“

“Let’s not talk about this,” he said. “Please.”

“Alright.”

Nick got up and walked over to the door. He was gonna give me some privacy, but just as he closed the door, he turned back to me.

“I’m not a goddamn perv,” he said.

“Yeah you are,” I scoffed back.

“Okay, you’re good,” he sighed. “Fucker.”

 

Apparently, Evan had mapped out what was going to happen to me to the best of his abilities. It was a lot worse than he’d anticipated though. There’d been talk about a fever and uncomfortable dreams, but I’d been kicked around worse than Evan had thought possible. Nick had been on the brink of getting me to a hospital, but that would’ve been a one-way ticket bay to a Hatchet facility.

After a couple of days of recovery, I was back on my feet. I could’ve eaten a goddamn horse. I felt better than I’d done for months – like I was finally fully in control. I was still a bit hesitant about going to sleep, but that was more psychological than anything. I felt like a part of me understood something that the rest of me didn’t, and it made me uncomfortable. With a little bit of time, I was sure it’d settle down.

 

We made it back to the top of that hill. It was a calm October afternoon, but the wind remained. Evan was nowhere to be seen. Nick was religiously chewing gum. Turns out it was nicotine gum – he was quitting smoking. A new start.

“You still wanna do this?” he asked. “We can just go to Dallas.”

“If she gets the Digman kid, it’s gonna be bad,” I said. “Real, real, bad.”

“That bad, huh?”

He picked up a rock and flicked it down the hill, like he was skipping it across a lake. There was a thump as it smacked against a log.

“It’d kill a lot of people,” I said. “That’s what it wants.”

“So let’s just… let the DUC deal with it,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be us.”

“Maybe,” I sighed. “But do you wanna risk it?”

 

He picked up another rock, throwing it with the same flick of the wrist. Despite being thrown at the same power, and angle, it hit something else. Nick nodded at me.

“You scared the shit out of me,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like that.”

“Sorry,” I said. “I was having a bad time.”

He gave me the most obvious ‘no shit’-look I’d ever seen and turned his attention to finding another rock.

“So you figured her out yet?” he asked.

“Sort of,” I sighed. “It’s been a lot.”

“You know where she’s at?”

 

I was going to say ‘no’, but for some reason, I didn’t. Instead, I listened. I *forced* myself to listen. I took the reins. I imagined that distant red eye in the sky, and I listened to all the little heart beats shivering under its gaze. The sound they made was colder than the October wind, like little nails running through my skin, pulling at me.

“Yeah,” I said. “She’s north.”

Nick didn’t question it. He could tell I needed a minute, so he just gave me a pat on the back and made his way back down the hill.

“I’ll get the hunting rifles,” he said. “This, then Dallas.”

“This, then Dallas.”

 

He left me alone for a bit, leaving me to my thoughts. The world felt so frail, like a shivering egg. A firm push at the wrong angle, and something would break. We’d puncture the yolk.

I could see why they all wanted the Yearwalker dead. There was too much at stake.

And maybe we’d have to make some difficult choices.
