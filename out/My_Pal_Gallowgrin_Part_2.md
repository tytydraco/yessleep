\[This is the second half of my life confession. You can find part one here: [My Pal Gallowgrin : r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p8cxpi/my_pal_gallowgrin/)\] 

Not to brag, but I was a model prisoner. After spending sixth through eighth grades with the future prisoners and/or CEOs of America, the law determined I was sane enough to attend a regular high school. With the normal, only moderately disturbed kids.

 Apparently, this transfer took a great deal of protestation on the part of my parents. They never let me forget it. With so many kids enrolled, I’d hoped it’d be easier to hide in the background than during elementary school. Alas, it seemed my fifth grade legend had spread. As far as students who went to school in other towns. Other states, even.

I was a quiet, reserved kid. For my teachers, that made my presence even more disconcerting. They must have whispered in the teacher’s lounge “Did you hear what he did? When’s the shooter going to go off again?”

My fellow students similarly considered me a psycho. I had been tall as a kid, but now I was a giant. With a mustache at fourteen. Few bullies wanted to mess with me. Even if they had, they could never hope to match the sadism of my original bully.

A certain anti-mystique grew around me which other social pariahs recognized. I didn’t hang out with the goth kids, but they hung around me. Just seemed to gravitate into my orbit. I guess darkness recognized darkness, and I was a black hole.

One lasting effect of killing Gallowgrin was that no horror story frightened me afterwards. Not even the movie about the evil spaceship. Margo, one of the goth kids, insisted on trying. Together, we laughed at the worst exploitative trash. Those directors never seemed to get the color of blood right. If always looked bright orange or pink when the real stuff is much darker.

I’m glad we didn’t shack up then. Margo’s proposal was still years away. You’re never at your worst than in your teens. I automatically distrust any self-proclaimed “high school sweethearts” I encounter. The only people that eked out joy during those agonizing—yet somehow also banal—years must be sociopaths.

The hard, poor college years passed. Then graduate school. After that, the long engagement.

Baby Rosamund came along exactly a year after Margo and I were married. Our little bundle of mostly joy. The name wasn’t my idea. It wasn’t after that actress, either. It was the name of Margo’s aunt she expects a slight inheritance from. I, and everyone else except the aunt, call her “Rosie.”

Funnily enough, for someone obsessed with blood and guts on screen, Margo doesn’t like any kind of real violence in our home. She won’t even let Rosie play with Nerf guns or water pistols, to the disappointment of our tomboy.

Six years went by. Things were going well. My job was unambitious, but paid fine. I didn’t need to be in the office every day. Margo no longer wears as much leather or black lipstick. Rosie did great in pre-K, then kindergarten. The first real strife in our family was when our girl hit first grade. Overnight, this unfailingly happy-go-lucky kid turned depressed.

My first inkling why was when I stayed home working on test procedure specifications. My partner took Rosie to that make-your-own-doll store. You know, the one with a giant tube in the front where the cotton offal that fills stuffed animals but you usually aren’t forced to look at is perpetually churned.

No big deal. In a million years, I wouldn’t have guessed what my child chose to bring back with her. The doll was purple, vaguely simian. With a brown, ropey tail. And big, yellow marble eyes.

“He just needs metal teeth,” Rosie chattered away proudly. “Then, he’ll look just like how I see him. I really want to show you what he looks like. Except, he’s in…in…indivisible.”

“Why you sweating, ’Ron?” Margo asked.

“Who is ‘he?’” I asked through a suddenly parched throat.

“Gal-o-grim.” Rosie finally looked up from her doll. “Or Gal-o-grin, I think.”

“Where did you hear that name?” My hands were on Rosie’s shoulders. I looked her directly in the eye.

My partner frowned.

Rosie backed away. “Jeez, old man, it’s just the name of my friend.” Rosie went off to play with her new toy.

Margo had fruit bowls to sketch. I sat for a while. Looking down at my hands. Remembering how they’d been coated in blood. Red, almost brown. Just like a human. I felt sure I’d killed him. *But can you really kill an idea*?

After our battle, I hid Gallowgrin’s remains far away, at a construction site. I’d timed it so as to sneak in after the workers had already gone home for the night. A spot was marked off, to be filled with concrete in the morning. That’s where I dumped my backpack, filled with the red chunks of my ex-friend, plus his teeth I melted into scrap. All this time, I hoped his body was still buried there.

That evening, Rosie tore a sheet of aluminum foil to pieces. She taped the pointed fragments into the mouth of her stuffed animal.

This wasn’t a fluke. When Rosie brought home her first big art project of the year, the purple lemur was the subject. It got an A, by the way. I wasn’t, however, about to place it on the refrigerator with magnets. This happened again, and again. Finger paintings, watercolors, pencil drawings, a clay sculpture. Rosie fixated on recreating Gallowgrin’s image.

I was downing Tums like they were a class one narcotic. My partner didn’t understand my distress at seeing these images.

“What an *active imagination* your daughter has,” Rosie’s teacher said at an open house Margo and I attended. She meant it as a compliment.

How times have changed. When we were in school, being into fantasy and drawing monsters got you considered a freak. Now, hippie schools tried to nurture kid’s creativity. It felt deeply surreal for us, but Margo didn’t show it.

When Margo and I got back, the sitter was asleep on the couch, smelling of cannabis. Rosie was in the kitchen, making a racket behind the closed door. Inside, the room was a mess. The fridge and cabinets had been emptied out.

Rosie had taken out all the knives and laid them in a line on the floor. She mumbled, clearly in some trance. Her eyes were opened so wide, it looked like she’d lost her eyelids. She clanged knives together and shouted.

Margo made it to her first. “What are you doing?” She pried the blades from Rosie’s hands, and held our girl to her breast.

“I was just trying to speak Gallowgrin’s native language, mom.” Rosie’s trance had broken. Her cheeks were red. “When he talks, it’s this sound of metal. He kept saying ‘You know my true name, say it!’”

We checked her for injuries. That Rosie hadn’t cut herself felt like a miracle. I tucked her into bed.

 Margo made sure we never hired that babysitter again. But I had more to worry about than cleaning up the kitchen mess. Even the top cabinets were pried opened. Places Rosie was too short to reach…and the stepladder wasn’t out.

All our food—literally everything—was spoiled. Breakfast tomorrow would need to be via drive-thru. Bags and boxes were ripped open, and not all by human hands. I saw bite marks on the food and containers. Incisions too large for our cat Bubastis to make.

We didn’t want to punish Rosie for her actions. She clearly wasn’t herself at the time. We explained the importance of handling sharp objects responsibly, and that if she needed something cut, to ask either of us for help. Margo bought a padlock to go over the cutlery drawer.

Rosie was the kind of kid who loved climbing trees and splashing in streams. It wasn’t unusual for her to get scraped up occasionally. But when Margo was giving her a bath the next night, she found odd, fresh cuts on Rosie’s body. Some Neosporin and band aids, and my partner felt the matter was settled.

A month after, there were burn marks around Rosie’s throat. Like a cord had been wrapped around it. Usually, you couldn’t get our girl to stop talking. But long after her throat healed, she stopped being her usual chatty self.

“If it’s some bully at the school, I’ll KILL them.” Margo paced around our bedroom. “Literally, I will murder someone. You don’t think it’s the teacher, do you?”

*Could I tell her?* I thought. It would feel so good to tell someone the long-buried truth. It gnawed at me, not being able to tell even the love of my life what I experienced as a child.

Maybe a priest? Oh, but my family was never that religious. I wasn’t about to start.

*No*, I decided, *not even Margo would believe me*. She’d think I’m crazy, even dangerous. Take Rosie and leave for her aunt’s place. I wouldn’t be around to protect our daughter. And only I knew what was really happening. Such a familiar pattern.

I did the painfully rational thing, and kept quiet about what I knew. I maintained a close watch on Rosie from that point on.

Over the years, I’d write letters to no one in particular. Confessions, more like. Great rambling things, all my guilt and shame that could be put into words. Every letter wound up burnt in a fireplace. A little bit of pyromania at the end, as a reward. My weird way of venting.

Enough time had passed, I could almost pretend Gallowgrin really had just been a figment of my imagination. After all, my counselors told me so. And they had PhDs! Those white scars ranging across my body could have come from anywhere. After all, kids are clumsy. Always accidentally hurting themselves.

Mental illnesses often ran in families. Maybe I had unwittingly, selfishly passed on some bad gene to my innocent child. Yet one thing didn’t add up with that hypothesis.

If we were both mad, that means Rosie and I hallucinated the same image, decades apart. Her toy and collection of artworks proved that. How would she know the imaginary thing was named Gallowgrin? Outside a therapist’s office, I never told anyone about that. That just isn’t how hallucinations work.

 That thought kept me balanced. I could focus on the problem without nagging doubts of “That’s impossible!”

Maybe it took some time to scrap himself out of the grave I made. But this was Gallowgrin. I would put nothing past the monster. And of all the potential new victims in the world, he picked my daughter.

Margo couldn’t guess my exact thoughts, but she knew my emotions. While I tried, I couldn’t hide how upset I felt.

“It’s not a contest, ‘Ron,” she said. “I’m worried about our girl, too. But we’re semi-smart individuals. As a team, we’re almost functional. Whatever trouble’s going on with Rosamund, we’ll help her together.”

*If only*, I thought.

The next month, the pet hamster in Rosie’s class went missing. She had been the last one seen playing with him. The teacher grilled her where Hamburger (yep, that’s what the kids named him) might have gone. Rosie was mum.

The hamster was found days later, but not alive. A colored pencil had been jammed through his little throat. Purple. The same shade Rosie was missing from the rainbow set in her school supplies.

Margo asked if she had done it. Rosie said “No.” That one word. My partner believed her, and fought against the principal wanting to put our daughter in detention, or worse. I guess some things never change. Administrators and bureaucrats will always be assholes.

Word of the adults’ suspicions spread. Other students didn’t want to be around Rosie. She was getting ostracized, like I had been. I wanted my kid to have a better time. Before her birth, I trained to be more understanding as a parent. Less stern. Margo gladly picked up the slack on that one. I’d failed, and just kept failing.

I spoke to Rosie that night. “Rosamund, you should know—whatever scary things are happening to you right now—it’s not your fault.” *It’s my fault*, I thought, but couldn’t bring myself to say. “None of it is your fault. You’re a good kid, and I believe you.”

“Old man…” tears poured from Rosie’s eyes. Snot dripped from her nose.

Margo stepped into the room. Seeing us, she put a finger to her lips and winked at me from an angle Rosie couldn’t see. My partner quietly snuck away.

Rosie cuddled up against me a long while before drifting off. She slept that way, too. In the crook of my arm the whole night. By morning, the limb was pins-and-needles. Totally useless for work.

On our living room mantle, there was a glass box with nothing in it. At least, it appeared to have nothing in it. If anyone else touched it, I freaked out.

After killing Gallowgrin, I’d buried my mime weapon. Forgot about it for years. Until the first Christmas we had Rosie. We were visiting my mom’s house. By this point, my dad had drunk himself to death.

I went out for air. It was so cold I could see my breath, but I stayed because I sorely needed some peace and quiet. An impulsive thought came to me. As if on autopilot, my legs trekked through the crunching grass. To the copse behind our backyard. I wanted to test if I could find the exact spot where I’d buried the blade.

I found it. Right behind the old, weird-looking Howell tree, with a knot that looks like a face, where I’d left it. My bare hands dug it up from the frozen ground. Exactly as I remembered it. Gallowgrin’s blood still stained its edge, though by now the red shade had turned brown. I hid the weapon in the pocket of my windbreaker. Walked back into the house like nothing had happened.

No one queried where I’d been. I washed my hands while Margo was unwrapping all of Rosie’s presents for her. I ate the ham, sang the carols with everyone, and drove my family home. 

I’d kept the knife in the glass box for half a decade. Preparing backup plans and “just for emergencies” was what responsible adults did, after all. And the fear of a demon peering over my shoulder had never really gone away, only been muted.

I opened the box. Stale air bottomed out. My vision of the imaginary weapon had blurred with age. I could see a glint of silver inside. Nothing else.

But if I was quiet, thought hard enough, and shut one eye, I started to see a familiar dagger. I put my hand in the box, and my fingernails tapped on cool glass. Like fog, I could see the knife, but when I got close, I couldn’t touch it. My hand just went clear through.

I mulled my options. Yearning for the established rules of dealing with Christian demons. Say a few prayers, douse some holy water. Power of Christ does the rest. Simple. Whatever Gallowgrin was, it didn’t come with a guide book to exorcise it stashed in every hotel room.

I possessed the one weapon proven to work against him. Somehow, he’d cloaked himself to my sight. But I’d worry about killing something invisible in Phase Two. I put that idea straight out of my mind. For now, it was enough to grasp the handle.

So many details clutter the mind of an adult. Kids, when they’ve a mind to, can focus to a much heightened degree. I wasn’t practicing the meditations Margo raved about. But I developed my own mental exercises.

Whenever I had the house to myself, I focused on that intangible blade. Later, I’d have to take up the most hated profession in the world. Thinking the striped shirt I had as a kid wouldn’t still fit me, I ordered something like it in my current size.

“Are you about to rob a bank?” Margo teased me from bed as I looked at myself in the mirror.

“We’re not in that bad financial trouble…unless you started gambling again.”

“Whatever.”

“I’m not trying to look like a robber, ’Go. I’m trying to look like a mime.”

“Ahh, well you shouldn’t have told me, then. Rookie mistake, ’Ron. Also, don’t steal my makeup for this.”

Just for that, I gave her the silent treatment till morning.

I was pressed for time. The violence was escalating. Faster than when Gallowgrin had been my personal demon. Drawing things out must have gotten boring for him.

Rosie came home one day with a black eye. Margo went on the warpath at the school, but no perpetrator could be caught.

Anxiety struck over how slow I was proceeding with the knife. Mental static caused worse performances. I needed to *will* the knife into being solid. I had on my striped shirt, but no beret or greasepaint. I doubted they would have helped even if I had worn them. I plain wasn’t mentally prepared for this.

On weekends, Rosie was usually in her tree fort till dusk. But here was my daughter in the afternoon, tramping through the front door. She hadn’t come home alone.

“C’mon, Aaron.” It was Rosie’s mouth moving. But the voice was that of my first friend, and greatest enemy. “You don’t need that old thing. Admit it, we had some good times. But no point dwelling on the past. Don’t feel jealous, old buddy, but little Rosamund and I are friends now!”

“No, we’re not!” Rosie gagged, rubbing her throat to get back control of her voice. “Not anymore.”

“Best friends.” Gallowgrin spoke through her again. “For life. We’ve learned new games, like ventriloquism. I like her more than I ever did you, Aaron. She’s much less of a whiner! And, if possible, your little brat is even more of an awful kid than you.”

“That’s not the insult you think it is,” I countered. “I was a good kid. A better one after I didn’t have you around pressuring me. I didn’t deserve the way my father, my school, and you treated me. None of it. But I didn’t let that bullying turn me into someone just as mean.

“I didn’t pass my pain down to the next person who was weaker. I came through it a more empathetic, caring person. But don’t think that doesn’t mean I can’t beat you all over again. This doesn’t have to end violently. Let my daughter go. Leave us alone forever. Never come back.”

“Ha, are you a coward now, Aaron?”

“No, I’m a grownup. We try to solve things without fighting, if we can.”

“We can’t, old pal.”

“I figured. In that case, here’s something I wasn’t brave enough to say then, and couldn’t after I’d buried your bloody rotting carcass under stone. If you’re the only friend available, anyone would be better off alone. But I’m not. It took time, and opening myself up, but I found my community. I’ve built a good life. You think you can wreck that, like you wrecked my childhood?” I laughed, more than a little insanely. “I don’t need you, Gal. I never did.”

Reaching into the glass box, I could hold the knife! I pointed the blade carefully. Not at Rosie, but at the spot right above her left shoulder. That’s where Gal always curled around me. I banked on that still being his favorite spot.

Gallowgrin screamed. He didn’t take Rosie’s voice. This was an earsplitting buzz of anger. Lightning hitting metal.

I wasn’t speaking anymore. Even a whisper, and I knew my mime ability would leave me. I breathed through my nose, just in case any mouth sound would steal my ability. I gestured with a finger for him to come get me. Rosie gasped.

 Something unseen hit my chest. I heard claws slicing through the air, towards my eyes. But the attack never landed. I had imagined the knife turning into a shield. The impact hurt, but I’d braced my arm and planted my feet, so I wasn’t knocked over.

“Good block, dad!” Rosie massaged her throat. Her tongue her own again. She’d stay free as long as I kept our shared bogeyman occupied.

I couldn’t tell her to run far away like I wanted to. Rosie stayed in the living room. But she was smart enough to hide in a corner, behind the couch.

With a thought, my shield morphed into something new. As a youth, I imagined the mime weapon as a simple knife. In my decrepit age of thirty-five, I had gotten more ambitious. The current picture in my head was of a great sword, the blade as long as me. Had it been steel, I couldn’t have lifted it. But it felt only slightly heavier than a feather.

“Slice Gal apart!” Rosie cheered before ducking back behind the seat. 

*She can see the weapon, too*. I didn’t wonder why, just accepted it as fact.

Gallowgrin prowled somewhere nearby. I checked for his shadow on the wall. Listened for the soft pad of his footsteps. The sound of his tail swishing. Any sign that might help give away his location.

I swung widely, each direction in turn. By persistence, or blind luck, I eventually struck something.

The demon didn’t scream this time, but I heard a gnashing of metal against metal. It came from an alcove of the room, too narrow for my broadsword to maneuver. Needing something more precise, I thought up a battleaxe.The axe head missed the mark, but the handle crunched into flesh. I hearda moist squelch. On reflex, I gagged.[ ]()

That was all Gallowgrin needed for a distraction. Nails raked across my face. The pain broke my concentration. For a second, the axe vanished. But I took the pain, and let it heighten my determination. My imaginary weapon became visible and solid again.

“Old man, I want to imagine something, too!” Rosie said from her hiding place.

I nodded.

“Make it a javelin. No, a morning star. I’ve got it, a boomerang!” Her suggestions and my imagination combined details of historical weapons with elements straight out of fantasy. As long as I held the weapon, I felt confident Gallowgrin could be put down.

Without having to break my vow of silence and ask, Rosie pointed out to me wherever Gallowgrin was at any given time. But the target kept moving. Always outside my range.

“Bow and arrows…no, a crossbow is better!” 

I didn’t know where to shoot. Rosie pointed, then I fired. Her hand wavered. My imaginary crossbow had infinite bolts. According to Rosie, nonetheless, I kept missing.

“Let me take control, dad!”

I relaxed, not sure what she intended. Without me pressing down, I heard the crack of the bowstring. Instead of proceeding in a straight line, the feathered bolt followed Rosie’s hand gestures, pinning something to the wall. Blood splattered across the cream-painted surface.

From his red halo, Gallowgrin had grown. I still couldn’t see him directly, but with that hole into his insides, he’d lost the advantage of total invisibility.  
Blood dripped in a line across the carpet. I tried to follow, but he had already crossed the room. Gore dribbled down my daughter’s overalls.

“Help m…!” Rosie almost finished saying. Too late, the demon took over. She was lifted into the air.

The bloody hole was healing itself. “Your trick only worked once, Aaron! My power’s only grown since I cut ties with you. Put down the weapon.”

I reverted the crossbow to a dagger, and laid it on the floor. I raised up my hands, and kept them that way.

“I’ll make you a deal, my sweet, budding flower,” The blades in Gallowgrin’s mouth clashed sharply, but his actual voice was guttural and deep. “Because we’re such close buddies. Feed me your pets, your friends, your teachers. The more I devour, the more my maw can expand. I will eat the moon, then the sun. I will leave the Earth a cold, dark place, the remains of humanity drifting off into a nothing that doesn’t care you exist, and won’t care when you’re gone.”

“No!” Rosie said, along with something her mom would have grounded her for. I was impressed, though. I didn’t learn that word till sophomore year.

“C’mon, Rosie. At least kill your daddy for me. Get the knife. Offer him up as a sacrifice, and I won’t touch you, or your mommy. Do it, and I won’t bother you ever again. He deserves it, after how shamefully he treated me! What do you say?”

“Chainsaw!” Rosie pushed her attacker away, and dropped onto the carpet. Gallowgrin’s wound was the width of a pin, but for the next few seconds, I could track him.

Where I left it, the knife had indeed become a chainsaw. It revved as soon as I touched it. I practically smelled gas exhaust.

Since it worked so well the first time, I decapitated the monster. I pulled this off one-handed, since the other covered Rosie’s eyes, blocking out the grisly view. I left her covering them herself, but I felt pretty sure she was peeking out between them.

A fountain of blood gushed from the stump, then stopped. Gallowgrin had enough gore on his face and hands that I could make out him placing the head back on. The wound that should have been lethal healed. Head and body rejoined. Then, there were just bloody handprints up the walls and ceiling.

A sudden weight dropped on my shoulders. My legs buckled. It felt like I was holding up an entire world. Gallowgrin had done this before. He’d freed me by accident the first time. Now, his grip was iron, digging into my shoulder and hips.

Childhood had been the worst period of my life, though I lacked one iota of the worries I owned as an adult. Yes, you have responsibilities as a grownup, but you also possess some degree of control. As a kid, you’re powerless.

To feel this way again, after so many years…the early ones sad and difficult. But the later ones wonderful. The kind of wonderful that makes up for the helplessness of childhood. I wasn’t going to let those times end! Both the downside and strength of maturity is having something—someone—to protect.

I focused on one thought. “*He’s an idea. Just an idea. And even the bad ones don’t really weigh anything*.” I felt the rope tail starting to wrap around my dueling arm, but I tossed the saw to my other hand.

I was bruised, sliced, and crushed. But my resolve exploded. I grasped the invisible devil off my shoulders, and hurled him to the carpet. I buried the serrating blades through his ribcage. The stone that was his heart became visible. I reached for it, but was kicked in the throat.

His wounds were closing up. I could vaguely see Gallowgrin’s outline, a blood halo, but he shook himself off. Again, he was completely hidden from me.

“Sniper.” Rosie muttered behind the couch.

Putting my eye to the scope, I got some help. Through the magic crosshairs, I could see Gallowgrin. As well as I could as a kid. He’d turned hideous. Even worse than before. No purple fur, not even scales, just scabbed, slimy hide dotted with tumors.

“You scared to see me again, Aaron?”

*Shot*! I put the biggest hole yet through his body.

“Rocket launcher.” My daughter was apparently one for overkill. Who knew?

“No, please Aaron,” Gallowgrin begged. “You were my best friend. I’ll be good again, just don’t…”

We were close to winning. The demon must have known that, if he was bargaining like this.

“Atomic bomb!” Rosie shouted while standing up.

“*Smart girl*,” I thought. But my mouth was a white line.

“Ah fuck,” Gallowgrin cried. That was his epitaph.

There was no sound of an explosion, but my ears popped. A pressure like I just dived to the bottom of a pool. My eyes blurred. I felt Rosie’s hands wrapping around my legs. I took her up into a great embrace.

My hearing came back. Rosie was laughing. I realized I was, too.

I don’t know if it was a demon or some kind of malevolent god we killed. Maybe something so ancient, we didn’t have terms for it. Something predating descriptions entirely. Gallowgrin had told Rosie he had a “true name,” but I didn’t need to hear it. It was useless now, anyway. There’s be no gravestone to inscribe it on.

Rosie and I swept up the purple ashes, dividing them into small piles. Every piece of him was atomized, including those metal teeth. The final battle seemed to have taken hours, but there was still daylight out. I carried my shovel, and Rosie had her little plastic trowel.

We buried the particles in separate plots in the fields outside our home, spaced as far apart as possible. The hope was that the monster couldn’t reassemble himself so easily. I prayed the piles didn’t each reform into their own tiny Gallowgrin.

We finished the last pile. Rosie drew a map of the locations, which I threw in the fireplace when we got home.  So we could forget.

Rosie warmed her dirty hands. “Wish we had some marshmallows.”

I popped a frozen pizza into the oven. Margo would get back from her gallery soon. (Yeah, Rosie certainly didn’t get her artistic streak from me.) I hoped our daughter would draw something other than purple lemurs from now on.

“How will we explain to mom about your face?”

“We’ll tell her Bubastis scratched me.”

We didn’t need to rush cleaning the house, but it felt better to get it over with. Rosie and I couldn’t stomach looking at invisible bloodstains every day. We shampooed the carpet and mopped off the walls. No hole where the crossbow bolt hit. It pierced the demon, but left no mark on the physical world.

Lastly, I picked up the shell of the bomb, imagining it back into its dagger form. The same not-shape and not-color. I slipped it back into its case. With great ceremony and solemnity, I passed the container off to Rosie.

“Other than the love I receive each day for you and your mom, this is my most valuable possession,” I said. “If Gallowgrin ever comes back, no matter how old you are, or if you have a son or daughter of your own, just open this case. You’ll have a weapon to put him down a third time. And the third time’s the charm.”

“I’ll treasure it always, old man,” Rosie said in that over-serious way children sometimes attempt. It can’t help but make you laugh so hard, they get angry.

“Trust me, Rosamund, whatever tool you’ll need for life, it’s yours. It’s simple. Too easy. All you have to do is imagine it.”

Rosie stuck out her tongue. “So cheesy, old man.”
