Been debating whether I should post about this for a while. But after what happened this past weekend, I don’t feel like I have a choice anymore. Looking to hear if anyone's been through something similar / any advice on what to do.

For context, I gotta first rewind to about five years ago. Just before covid was popping up on everyone’s radar.

It was 2019 and I was living in Los Angeles. West LA, for those who know the area. Had been there about 6(ish?) years and had finally fallen in love with it. For non-locals, LA takes a little warming up to. But once you find your people, your job, etc., it can be a pretty fun place to live.

The city itself wasn’t perfect but it’s one of those places where you always feel like something is happening if you just know where to look. Kinda like a buzzing energy. By 2019 it had changed a bit, mostly because the homeless situation had gotten out of control. Not that I ever felt unsafe, but you hear enough people screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night and you get a little jumpy. And this was before the Echo Park Lake takeover, mind you.

LA might have been falling apart, but 2019 was a banner year for me personally. I came out to Hollywood to be a film/tv editor and the first bunch of years were rough. Hard to break in. Was doing a lot of (unpaid) student short films, some (barely paid) TikTok/IG work, and a little porn (hentai, lol) at one point. None of that was really the dream though. The dream was features. But in 2019, I got pulled in by a friend to be an assistant editor on a big-time reality show (can't say which one, but it had been on for many seasons at that point and is still going strong today). Suddenly I was making $1700 a week. Maybe not much to some of you, but for me it felt like I was bathing in cash.

Okay, back to the homeless situation. Every morning I’d walk to Starbucks before work to grab a redeye and I’d pass this encampment near a little park. There were at least a dozen homeless men and women there at any given time. Definitely one of those parks I wouldn’t go past at night, but at six in the morning, no sweat.

And every morning I walked by, I’d see this *guy.*

Never got his name, but to make this easy let’s call him John.

John had to be the roughest of the bunch. Curly red hair, skin that was probably pale once but had been turned permanently bright red from sunburn. I swear you could almost see the melanomas forming. His lips were crusted white, his face dry and sunken like someone put a straw in the back of head and sucked hard. He didn’t have eyes so much as he had sockets from which, somewhere deep, he peered out.

But what stood out most of all was the smell.

I don’t know how to describe it except to say it wasn’t normal. Not the usual sour tang of sweat and urine. It was like spoiled meat and chemicals or something. It clung to the air around him and made my stomach churn.

Long story short, there were older and more sad-looking people there, but this dude was the scariest, at least to me. Every morning he’d be laying out his belongings -- soda cans, potato chip wrappers, bike parts, anything -- as if he were putting them out for sale. But he’d always be rearranging them, moving this Pepsi can here, that ziplock bag of nuts and bolts there. Like some sort of Rubik’s cube he was constantly twisting without answer.

All of the above made me feel for him. Actually scratch that. All of the above made me feel *guilty*.

So I started giving him things.

Whenever I passed, whatever I had. A few bucks whenever I was carrying cash, which wasn’t often. A croissant from Starbucks sometimes. If I ever ordered takeout for dinner, I’d set the leftovers by the door so I’d remember to bring them to him in the morning.

The first time I said “Hey man” and offered him something (maybe a sandwich? Can’t remember) he looked at me like I was the crazy one, totally annoyed that I had disrupted his Rubik’s cube swap-around. But he took it silently and went back to work. Every time after, he’d take what I had to offer without a word, as if he expected it. Made me chuckle inside, to be honest. His eyes were always darting around his things, clearly too absorbed to give me too much time. I started to think maybe he couldn’t speak, or maybe in his whacked-out brain he said “thank you” and expected me to read his thoughts.

I didn’t mind. It made me feel better. It was a daily reminder that no matter how bad my life was, it wasn’t John-level bad. And it made me shittily proud. Like, it was this thing I did that nobody at work or any of my friends knew about. Yeah, I know how that sounds. I’m a self-important asshole. But still, it felt good.

Okay so cut to early 2020. The reality show gig was coming to a close and I didn’t have my next one lined up. That’s kinda the life for editors of a certain level, so I was used to it. But I’d gotten a little addicted to seeing those numbers hit my bank account.

One night, I got home from work absolutely starving and decided to hit up the taco truck around the corner. It was super cold that night and as I huddled near the grill while they made my tacos, I looked down to the park encampment a few blocks away. Figured John must’ve been freezing. So on a whim I ordered 10 more tacos (it was like $40 max, nothing crazy) and walked them down to him.

To be honest, I forgot how scary that park could be at night. Most of the people were in their tents or under their tarps. You could hear them moving around in there, whispering to each other (or themselves) and just fidgeting to find a comfortable spot on the concrete. Forgot to mention: nobody was allowed to sleep in the park itself, so all the tents were lined up on the sidewalk around it. Super backwards. No regular joe would go into the park because of the homeless, and yet the homeless were not allowed in either. So it was just an empty spot of grass surrounded by people who would’ve really benefited by laying on a surface that wasn’t rock hard.

Anyway, I found John there. He was the only one who hadn’t packed it in for the night yet. He was still sorting through his wares, moving them back and forth silently. If eyes could mumble, that’s what his eyes were doing.

I said “Hey man,” and handed him the bag of ten tacos. He looked up at me, and for the first time since I started doing all this, it was like he actually saw me. And this time he wasn’t annoyed that I was bothering him.

He took the bag. And then he spoke.

“Why do you do this?”

I was floored. There was a light in his eyes all of a sudden. It was like the man inside the shell peeked out, and he was totally lucid. I didn’t know what to say, so I said something trite like “You seem like you could use the help” or something.

He looked at me longer. I thought maybe I’d offended him until he said (and I recall his words verbatim): “You’re a good man.” His voice was crystal clear. Didn’t warble a bit.

“Not really,” I replied.

“What can I do for you, then?” he asked. His voice felt like it literally struck me. His tone was almost reverent, like he was offering me something sacred and holy. This… *favor.*

Now, here’s where the fuck up happens.

I have a seriously morbid sense of humor. Don’t know why, something about growing up on the internet, probably. It was way more of a thing when I was in high school, and it basically equated to me saying off-hand shit like “Hey could you suffocate me with a pillow?” or “Wouldn’t mind dying right about now.” It was never malicious. I wasn’t one of those guys going around posting DIAF. I also wasn’t a cutter or did any self-harm. I just got a kick out of the shock value, I guess. Very childish, I know. Kinda grew out of it in my twenties, but those stupid responses still popped into my head as a gut reaction.

And in that moment, I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t want anything from John, at least nothing he could give me. So, before I could stop myself, that old morbid humor took over --

“Would you mind killing me?” I said. I laughed as I said it, in fact. But his face… God, his face. It went totally dark. Instantly I knew I fucked up and added “Just kidding, of course” and apologized for my twisted sense of humor.

But John didn’t laugh. Instead, for the first time ever, he smiled. His front two teeth were gone, and the rest were yellow and overlapped painfully.

“Sure thing, man,” he said. His s’s whistled when he spoke.

I swear to God, a chill ran down my spine. I wanted to reiterate that I was kidding, but just like that, he was back to his sorting. The light in his eyes disappeared back into those sunken sockets.

I didn’t know what to do. And it seemed like the conversation evaporated from his mind, like I couldn’t even be sure that any of it stuck. So I told myself just that. That it was a meaningless moment.

I walked back to my apartment. I thought about going back, trying to talk to John and confirm that he didn’t take me seriously. But a week later, the cops had cleared the encampment. The homeless people were all dispersed to God-knows-where, John included.

I never saw him again. And within a month, I’d forgotten it ever happened.

That was five years ago.

I don’t live in LA anymore. Covid hit, the industry shut down, and even when it came back, people low on the totem pole like me were shit outta luck. Now I’m in a different state and I have a job that doesn’t pay nearly as much. Which state and what job, I’m not comfortable saying. Same reason I’m writing this from a throwaway.

My new place doesn’t have that LA excitement (or LA weather ☹) but I’m much happier here. I have a girlfriend for the first time (let’s call her Jenny) and even though the paychecks don’t make my eyes pop, they are more than enough. Even got a one-bedroom in 2024 for the same price as I had a studio in LA in 2019, which is bonkers.

Long story short, my new chapter has been good. Leaving the industry felt almost like a weight off my shoulders. Like I was trying to achieve this impossible dream and every moment of every day I felt guilty for not doing more to get it done. Now all I’m trying to achieve is happiness. Maybe not enough of a challenge for most, but I don’t care. For the first time in a long time, it feels like I can breathe.

Until a few months ago.

I don’t recall when it started exactly, except that at first it was in the middle of the night.

I started waking up confused. That’s the best way to put it -- confused. At least once a week, I’d find my eyes open in the middle of the night. Took a few instances to make me realize why. My apartment was making noises. Not like “the air conditioning just kicked on” noises. Like, someone was moving around in the next room. Not footsteps, per se. Something else. I didn’t give it a second though, especially because Jenny didn’t notice it, although admittedly she’s a pretty deep sleeper.

Then one night after work, while I was meal prepping for the week, I opened the utensil drawer in my kitchen and stopped short. The silverware had been moved around. Nothing crazy -- seemed like Jenny had switched the knives and forks. Simple mistake. Probably emptying the dishwasher and just forgot where things normally went.

I dismissed it at the time.

And yet, at least once a week, there I was, my eyes open in the pitch-black bedroom. Hearing something moving in the other room. Remember: I’d lived in a studio my entire adult life until now. I wasn’t used to waking up in a place where I couldn’t see everything I owned all in one room. I wasn’t used to this feeling.

A few times, I got fed up and investigated the noises.

But whenever I’d open the door to the living room, all I saw was shadows. That feeling I got, though, scanning the empty darkness of the silent apartment… there was always that slight spike of adrenaline, the voice in my head goading me, saying “what if someone is standing there in the dark, staring at you right now?”

Of course that was never the case.

Cut to last weekend. Jenny was out of town, and I woke up in the morning alone. We aren’t living together yet but she spends almost all her nights here regardless. This time I’d slept through the night (or did I? I can’t remember) and felt totally relaxed. Immediately hustled into the bathroom for my morning piss. And when I did, I looked in the mirror.

The picture that normally hangs in my bathroom (an art deco Popeye piece) wasn’t there. Instead, the framed Radiohead poster from the living room was in its place.

I must’ve stared at it for five straight minutes. It had never been there before. And Jenny wasn’t around to ask or accuse. I figured I’d deal with it later, but then I went into the living room to make my morning coffee and my heart dropped into my stomach.

It wasn't just Radiohead and Popeye. All of my wall art had been rearranged.

Every single poster and painting, every Funko Pop and bit of memorabilia. The photos on my fridge were all in different places. Nothing taken as far as I could tell. Just everything moved.

I almost had a panic attack, to be honest. But I didn’t even think to call the police. The more I thought about it, the more I told myself to let it go. Like maybe I’d been sleepwalking (I used to do that when I was younger). Or somehow forgot I’d redecorated. I hadn’t connected the dots yet. It’d been five years, remember?

It’s just like when I get sick. Do I go to a doctor? Nope. I just close my eyes and hope it goes away.

That brings us to last Saturday night.

The Saturday after Thanksgiving is a bit of a personal holiday. I’m usually still stuffed with food and feeling gross anyway, so I like to do a bit of day drinking, and night drinking, and late-night drinking. With friends, of course. Dunno why. Just one of those things I did once and then kept doing. And last weekend I did just that. Barhopped with Jenny and some buddies. I got more wasted than the rest, but in my mind it was mission accomplished. Jenny dropped me off at my place at about one in the morning. She told me ahead of time she wouldn’t be staying over since I was bound to be throwing up all night. All good, I didn’t mind.

It was cold out, I remember that.

I remember stumbling up to my door and taking a long time to get the key in the lock.

I remember opening the door and spilling inside. The apartment was pitch-black and I couldn’t see a thing. In my drunken state, I’m thinking I’ll just feel my way through the dark and once I find my bed, I’m gonna collapse until further notice.

So I started groping through the dark.

Baby steps, waiting for my knee to hit the side of the couch or my toe to hit the corner wall and give me guidance.

But halfway through the living room, I stopped.

Why did I stop? Because something smelled *awful.* At first I thought maybe it was just the kitchen trash can. But it wasn’t. I took a deep breath in. Trying to place it. It was a smell I remembered.

Spoiled meat and chemicals.

Yep, you guessed it.

Suddenly, I was stone-cold sober.

I raced back to the front door and flipped on the lights in a panic.

I looked around, but nobody was there. To be honest, if I had seen John standing there in the middle of my apartment, I might have fainted. I’ve never been so terrified in my life. I searched behind the couch, in the cabinets below the kitchen sink. It really smelled like he was right there with me.

And that’s when I noticed my bedroom door.

It was closed.

Not totally unnormal. Jenny closes the door when she goes to sleep while I’m still playing video games, which is why it didn’t catch my eye at first.

But Jenny wasn’t there. And I’d never have the door closed otherwise.

Suddenly, my heart was pounding in my throat.

At first I kept dead still. Just listened.

But I swear the night was quieter than it’d ever been before.

I stepped up to the closed door. No light from beneath.

If there was someone in there, he was standing in the dark.

I stood there forever. Listening. Waiting.

The smell was all around me.

I didn’t know what else to do. I definitely wasn’t going in there.

So, for whatever reason, I spoke these words --

“Hey, whoever is in there. Can you please just go away?”

I waited. And waited.

And just when I was about to relax, I heard a whisper that gives me goosebumps just writing it out now.

“Sure thing, man.”

Whistling s’s and all.

That was around one in the morning on Sunday. I immediately left and went to Jenny’s house. We came back together to my place in the morning, but John wasn’t there. The smell had almost entirely disappeared.

Jenny believes me, of course. But I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how he found me or how he’s getting into my house. I’d forgotten about the guy until now and it seriously feels like a bad dream.

I’ve been staying at Jenny’s apartment all week and I’m gonna finally call the cops today to file a report. But I doubt they’ll be able to do anything for me, which is why I’m posting here.

If anyone has advice (or if something similar happened to you?) please let me know. Thanks in advance.
