Hey, my name is detective Marlowe. 5 years ago, I was working as a detective at the Harrodsburg police department. I had just been named the hero of Harrodsburg! I was the man that had solved every case thrown his way and was awarded for cleaning the streets up. I was so happy until the day tragedy struck our small town. I was told I could never speak about this case…but…I cannot hide it anymore. I need to tell everybody the truth of the hunt for what people like to call the cat and mouse killer. I know it sounds like a silly name but what he did to this town will never be forgotten.

October 14th, I found out that my mother had lung cancer. I spent a lot of time with her by making breakfast, dancing to her favorite music with her and just spending a lovely day with her. I would always feel bad about leaving her to go to work, but she always reassured me that it was okay because I was stopping the bad people of Harrodsburg. 

October 30th, I had just made us breakfast and was enjoying my time with her. We were talking about when we had first got the house. I was about 10 years old, and we were getting away from my abusive father which we did not speak about.  When we first got the house, it was very gross and needed a serious remodeling. We tore apart the walls and discovered that the whole house was infested with black mold. We then had to learn how to repair the walls we took down and make sure that the mold wouldn't grow back. After finishing replacing the walls, we had to go through and repaint the rest of the gross white walls that were stained by cigarette smoke.  The flooring was so nasty that it caused the entire house to smell like shit which had led to us having to completely replace it. Mind you the house might have been bad but staying with that monster was a lot worse. As we were talking about how happy we were about turning the house around completely, I received a call from my partner and best friend detective Morgan. Morgan said “hey Marlowe, sorry for bothering you. I know you are with your mom right now but the body of frank has just been found in front of the hot lagoon and its pretty bad so we will need your help.” I told him “No, it’s fine, if it's as bad as you say then I need to be there.” Morgan said, “thank you sir, please get here soon because we truly need to find the guy that did this.” I hung up and told my mom “I love you; I really don’t want go but I need to.” She just smiled and told me “Son, whatever you're doing is very important to this town.” I smiled and hugged her. 

I headed down to the hot lagoon, a bar about 5 miles out. When I had arrived, Morgan came over to me telling me “You really need to check this out it’s not like anything we’ve seen before.” I headed down past the ambulance, the police officers, the news, and all the people that were sitting there in shock. I looked around at the Halloween decorations that they had placed all around the front of the bar. There was spider webs placed across the bushes and skeleton props sitting in the lawn chairs that was placed directly on each side of the entrance but right in front of the door was frank. What I saw was like nothing I had ever seen before in my life. It was frank but his entire stomach was opened like a butcher gutting a pig. His intestines were pulled around these two dead mice in the form of a circle. There was something wrapped up placed right between the mice, so I put my gloves on and pulled it out. I tore open the paper and found 

 a video tape that said, “happy birthday-Marlowe” I looked over at Morgan and told him “We need to see what this is about.” We looked around the hot lagoon for hours just trying to find any piece of evidence but to our surprise not a single footprint or handprint was anywhere to be seen. So, we took pictures of franks body and around the lagoon and decided to take one last sweep around and still had found no clues. We are at loss of who could have possibly done this or what could have happened. I looked over at Morgan after heading back to our patrol cars and said what we were all thinking by this point “We need to find this guy because I don't think this will be the last”.  Morgan agreed and brought up how the killer could easily be ten steps ahead that he thinks we need to check out the tapes and try to look at any footage the bars security cameras could have possibly picked up.

We headed down to the station to talk to the boss Mr. Jackson. It was about 15 miles down the road from the hot lagoon. Me and Morgan were fast walking in the decent size building past the police officers that we completely ignored. We headed into the office at the very end of the hall and sat down to talk to Mr. Jackson, we handed him the video tape in a paper wrap  and told him “we found this in the body of frank…it says happy birthday to me and I don’t really understand who would know me that is out to get me” Jackson looked at us telling us “oh god, who would think one day somebody would be after the hero of the city.” Morgan looked over at me, saying “yeah I believe they have to be close to Marlowe and we just need to watch the tape so we can maybe see who it is.” We pulled out the TV and the video player that Jackson likes to keep in his closet. I looked around with a pale white face and nodded at them as I placed the tape in. 

It started with somebody walking up to this table with a blanket, hearing the muffled-out screams and cries. He pulled it off slowly saying “happpppy birthday to you, happy birthday to you” he pulled the blanket off, showing us franks who seemed to be tied down to the table and his mouth covered in tape. The man that did this grabbed a butcher knife and put his hand on frank as we see him trying to fight but unable to all he can do is cry with his muffled screams slowly going away. we watched the killer place the knife on his stomach tearing through the top of his stomach and slowly watched the knife cut down. We heard the sound of screams fading and skin being tore in half almost as if frank was a pig at a butcher shop still saying “happy birthday to you” but once he was at the bottom, he opened up the stomach and placed the dead rats, finishing the video by saying “Marlowe, I hope your celebration gives you many memories. I hope you like the game we have begun playing” The video cut to black after that. I sat there staring into the black TV screen just feeling sick and for the first time ever…I was truly scared…. they patted me on the back saying it is okay we will find him. I did not know if I should believe them or not, I just knew somebody was out for me…I am sorry, I am starting to get sick…. I think it is time for me to take a break from this…I’ll be back to tell the rest just give me a bit….
