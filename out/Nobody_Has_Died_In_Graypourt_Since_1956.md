Part 1 - Blood Shock

Imagine you wake, pinned to a hospital bed. You try to speak but the air whistles through the slit carved into your neck. each breath fills your lungs with a desperate gurgle of warm blood. Your agony is immeasurable, and you're unable to move. You can only plead one message through rolling eyes and whimpers,

"make it stop"

Graypourt is, by all accounts, a lovely little town trapped on the border of civilisation and country. The kind of place where street lights and kebab shops can quickly become dark fields and quiet winding roads. The situation that has been plaguing this town is so horrific that, if I were to tell you, you wouldn't believe me. But I have to try.

My name is Seth Ober. I'm an English teacher and I live here with my wife, Sophie. We were city people up until last year, but decided to uproot and head for quieter waters. The decision came after we found out Sophie was pregnant with our baby boy, Elijah. We wanted a slower paced environment to lull us into our new lives as parents. The countryside.

We chose Graypourt because the rent was manageable and Sophie's parents live nearby enough to help us out with the baby. Sophie has also had fainting spells in the past, and although she hasn't had an episode for many years now, I was nervous about leaving her home alone during the pregnancy.

Our prior visits to Graypourt had allowed the warm feeling of home to nestle itself here long before we decided to make it a reality. It wasn't like we were moving to a completely new area - Sophie had spent the majority of her childhood here, growing up among its quiet streets and rolling fields of flowers. The family moved away when she became a teenager. Her parents called it bittersweet, seeing us moving back to their old hometown. I mentioned the move to my coworkers, but of course they hadn't heard of the place.

It all clicked for us when I landed a job at the local school teaching English. We found our little semidetached house, and loaded up our lives into boxes and bags. The house itself is tucked out of the way, near the woods. A cobble path leading up to the light blue face of the house, bordered by unruly wildflowers. Sophie had started planning her vegetable garden the moment she saw the little patch of grass out back.

The neighbours were interesting, in a good way. Some would approach us with broad smiles, others would barely look us in the eye, but they all said the same thing about Graypourt - it was the best place they'd ever lived. One family in particular soon became familiar faces, the Yates. Sophie and Abi quickly hit it off, talking about the baby and their experiences with pregnancy. Before I knew it, Abi was unloading our van and giving my wife a crash course on life in Graypourt. The best places to get dinner, the best trails to walk, etcetera.

"The Tyndale garden centre has so much to see, trust me. They have this cute little Koi pond, and they keep lovebirds in there too! Oh and there's this adorable little cafe next to it, you have to try it." Sophie said she couldn't help but find Abi's enthusiasm endearing, even if it was a little much.

I awkwardly tried to strike up conversation with Isaac, Abi's husband, with no joy. I soon found out the guy had the personality of a salt shaker. I only figured out his name was Isaac because Abi said it in passing. Every question I asked was met with clipped answers.

"So, how long have you guys been in Graypourt?"

"Six years."

"...And where were you before?"

"Deving."

"I see."

Their kids stayed in their respective shells. I don't imagine they were stood out here of their own volition. Veronica, their teenage daughter, stood away from us buried in her phone. Silas, their young boy, stood staring vacantly as his father’s shoes. Abi gushed about her kids when they were babies, but seeing their cold indifference to their mother now, I felt an awkward twinge of sympathy for her. I guess I was scared of that part.

Abi was kind enough to offer their old baby stuff from the attic, which my wife eagerly accepted. I was a bit embarrassed but we needed the stuff. Teachers wages don't get you very far, even out here.

"Of course, we had to leave after the incident with Silas and the cat-"

"Thank you so much for your help Abi! You've saved me the biggest headache. We should get back to it, thanks again!" My wife smiled and gestured to the dozen or so boxes we had already pulled out of the van, but hadn't quite made it to the door with.

"Oh, yeah of course! Well, you know where we live now, so if you ever need anything feel free to stop on by!"

We thanked them once again. I rolled an expression of "thank god they're gone" over to my wife, which she returned. I guess new faces are rare in Graypourt.

After spending days knee deep in boxes, me and Soph figured we could use a break. A breath of fresh air. The Yates mentioned a spot they liked to go when they first came here, just outside of town. It sounded ideal, so we threw together a couple of sandwiches. I'm not exactly the rough manly type, but we both love the outdoors and were eager to see what Graypourt had to offer. That's where it started for us, I think - it was the deer.

"Are you sure you're holding it the right way up?"

"It's a smart phone, Sophie. It flips automatically." Always a smart-ass.

The roads were new to us and we ended up taking a wrong turn down a dirt track. We promptly realised our mistake and began looking for a space to turn around. None came as we hobbled our way down the rocky road, my car's suspension weeping with every bump. Eventually we came to a gate with a sign indicating we were on private property. Great. Trespassers is not exactly the first impression we wanted to make to the locals. I yielded and put the car in reverse.

Sophie sat up in her seat. "Wait! Looks like there's room to turn around in there, just through the gate. I'm sure they wouldn't mind, would they?"

"I don't know, it's private property. I'm not interested in getting yelled at by the hill people."

"It looks like it's just a field. Just open the gate and have a little look." She insisted.

"Yeah, yeah alright. Fine. You wait here."

I got out and squeezed my way past the bulk of the vehicle. Lifting the latch to the gate, I could see a large clearing on the other side. The track continued deep into the woods in front of me, but was broken by a stretch of thick grass extending uphill to my right, and downhill to my left. I noticed the rest of the track was sealed off by barbed wire, heavy duty stuff. I looked around for any sign of human life before deciding that it was enough for us to quickly turn our vehicle around.

The billowing white clouds drew my eyes down the slope. Just as I was turning to leave, a collection of sound from the top off the hill stole my attention. Looking up it, I saw grass flickering. Dashes of brown broke through the blades, and I heard a low rumble gathering in the distance. I thought I could hear Sophie calling my name, but I was too focused on what was unfolding in front of me. I was thunderstruck by what approached me.

Half a hundred deer came crashing down the hill. They rolled over each other in a mass of collective panic. Antlers broke off and flung from the herd as that battered themselves on trees and rocks.  Desperate, flailing hooves were swiftly closing the distance between me and them. Before I cloud flee, they swallowed the gap between me and the gate. All I could do was stand my ground as they pushed past me wildly, ignorant to their own murderous rampage.

I planted both feet firmly and prepared to take a hit as they ploughed through the dense grass. Antlers clipped and bashed my skin as they brushed past me. A sigh of relief shot from my lungs as I saw the last few passing by. I peered up the hill expecting to see the reddened face of an agitated farmer. What I saw instead was contorted and wrong.

Another deer, singled out. It struggled down the hill, it's head hanging low to it's side. Clotted blood fell from it's mouth. It came crumbling over the hill and slammed into me, sending us both tumbling further down. We slid to a muddy stop, the deer's weight pinning me. It thrashed, I felt a hard hoof crack down on my face as it fought and buckled against gravity. I instinctively brought my arms up to my face to shield myself from further blows. It continued to squirm and thrash, a half dead moan escaping its limp, broken neck.

"Get the fuck off!" I cried desperately in return.

I used my hands to shove it's heaving chest, bringing my legs up to buck it off. It tumbled to my side, staggering to regain it's footing and limping after it's herd. I too got to my feet, snatching my broken glasses from the floor and sprinting back to my car.

"What the fuck was that!?" Sophie whipped as I swung the door open, her head darting from the field to me.

"Fucking deer." I replied.

"What were they running from?"

"I don't know. We should leave."

"Yeah. You sure you're okay? Your lip is bleeding." I met her worried eyes.

"Just a scratch. We can turn around in there though." I put the vehicle into gear and rolled it forwards.

"Should we call animal control?" She asked with no particular enthusiasm.

"They're out in the woods, it'll be fine. And besides, I told them what's what. I don't think they'll be bothering anybody anymore." No doubt she was impressed by my masculine display of bravery.

"Wow! I'm sure that roadkill will remember who's in charge next time."

That was our first sign of it. I wish I told her more how much I love her.

I started my new job on Monday. It was a decent school, well looked after. Except, it's whole colour scheme was gray, I guess because of the town name. In my first English class, I would be teaching Silas, the Yates son. He's a shy kid, really keeps to himself. I didn't learn much about him aside from his name.

"Hey Silas, good to see you." His face lit up, like no one had ever used his name before. He listened keenly to the lesson. He didn't have many friends but he seemed like a good kid. Sophie said she was the same at that age.

I tuned into the radio on my way home from work. I flipped through a few different channels, and was surprised to hear a priest broadcasting a sermon from the local church. At least that's what I assume it was.

"Welcome children, to Trinity Radio. I'm Father Malachy, and I'm here to guide you today. I'll begin this by saying something you probably don't want to hear: God sees everything. Every action, every thought, every mistake. There is no escape from His eye. And yet, we've been told over and over again that He forgives, right? That no matter what, His grace is endless, His mercy unbounded. But what if that's not the whole truth?

What if it's not as simple as bowing your head, whispering your sin, and walking away clean? You see, this idea of forgiveness has become a convenient veil for our wrongdoings. A way for us to make peace with ourselves, to quiet the gnawing discomfort of guilt. God doesn't forget, and He doesn't always forgive.

In every corner of scripture, we're reminded that God is just. He sees the heart as it truly is, not the version we present to the world, not the mask we wear in our prayers. The mistakes we make, the lies we tell ourselves, and the people we hurt - they don't just disappear because we ask for forgiveness. They linger. They leave a mark.

What if the true weight of our wrongdoings don't just disappear into the ether? What if God, in His infinite vision, holds us accountable in ways we don't fully understand? What if every mistake, every sin, is etched into the fabric of who we are, carried with us like scars that don't fade?

There are consequences to every action, echoes that ripple out into the world long after we've forgotten them. And those echoes? They're heard. They're remembered. Before you rest easy in the idea of divine forgiviness, ask yourself: what if God isn't the endless well of pardon you've been told He is? What if He sees all and chooses not to forget? What then?"

I flipped the radio over to a local news broadcast at that point. I never grew up religious. Was never keen on the idea. But that sermon, if you can even call it that, was unlike anything I've ever heard from religious teachers. I wondered what Sophie would think of it, as she grew up religious.

In the deep embrace of thought I didn't see the dog scurrying across the road. I hit the breaks but it was too late. I slammed into the animal, a path of bloody viscera left in my vehicles wake. It took me a moment to formulate my thought. Then it came out rather bluntly.

"Shit."

I got out to see the damage, following the bloody trail to its broken corpse. It began to whine. Panic shot through my body like cold ice. I ran over to it.

"Oh god! Hey, hey! It's okay. Gah! Dammit!" It's rib cage had burst and organs spilled out from the opening.

I looked back to my car. I didn't want to, but I knew I had to. I got in and sacked it into reverse, tearing back over it's body a few times. Got out again. Legs went weak. It was still crying.

I felt sick. I looked at its crushed head, ruptured eyes and teeth scattered across the tarmac. I wobbled back to my car and backed over it again. I could now hear its cries from inside the vehicle. After a few minutes of this, I just drove off.

I was sweating like I'd just killed someone. It felt so wrong leaving that poor thing there but what else could I have done? I didn't tell Sophie. I came home pale and sat down for dinner.

"Hey hun, you have a good day at work?"

"Yeah." I nodded, jaw clenched.

She put the plate of chilli down in front of me and I instantly cringed. It looked like brains scattered across tarmac. I closed my eyes and tried to think about tomorrows lesson plans.

"You okay?"

"Yeah I'm fine. Thank you for dinner." I reached out for my drink but felt open air in my palm. The liquid lept out as it fell to the floor, silenced by the crack of glass. I stared at the spillage on the floor, the pieces broken by my own hands.

"Sack the juggler... You didn't want that?" She chuckled, waiting for me to give her a look. I didn't. "I uh... I'll go get a towel?" She stood slowly. I lifted my head, suddenly present in the room again.

"I... sorry! Let me get it."

"Are you sure you're okay Seth?"

"It's nothing. Just had a long day at work. Really, sit down, you've been working all day too. And I'm not the pregnant one!" I kissed her head as I moved past her to grab a dish towel from the kitchen. She reluctantly sat back down.

"Yeah you're not!" She called to me from the table. "My back is killing from painting the nursery. You should go see it."

Sophie had painted these beautiful doves soaring through clouds, it was really something - it was amazing. We were ready for the next chapter in our lives.

"It's… incredible!”

"Thanks. I hope he'll like it." I could do nothing to hide how I felt in that moment.

"I love you."

"I love you too." She smiled.

On the 15th of May, Sophie's water broke, and on the 16th we were expecting to have our bouncing bundle of joy. I drove like a maniac to the hospital while phoning her parents. I thought about calling my own. They wheeled Sophie into a cozy little maternity unit and prepared us for what should have been the best day of our lives.

The silence when he came out was deafening. Being close to family helped. We took things one day at a time after that. I buried myself in work which was admittedly not the best for our marriage. We had him cremated. God this hurts to type.

Abi would bring us groceries. I would come home to see my wife in floods of tears everyday. Sophie's parents were always there for us. I'm grateful for that. Mr Rashford is like a father to me, he really took me under his wing when me and Sophie were dating. A good man. It's why it hurts so much, having to lie to them. But knowing the truth would break them. Hell, it's broken me. The only reason I'm here writing this out to you now is because of Soph.

It was a busy Saturday afternoon and my wife had stepped out to pick up a few things. She had bumped into Abi while shopping for seeds at the garden centre, and had brought home an unmistakable sense of worry with her. Reined concern hung faintly in my wife's eyes as she recounted their conversation to me.

"How are you doing?"

"Yeah... Seth's back at work now. I'm doing a bit better. It's still hard."

"I'm sorry. If there's anything you need, we're here. I'm here... You know, I'm sure our pastor would be willing to help too, if you need it."

"Thanks, Abi. How are you guys doing anyway?"

"Oh things are a bit rocky right now. Veronica's flown the nest. Isaac thinks she's off with that boy. She's been gone for days." Abi said the next part in a whisper. "I'm worried sick to tell you the truth, but Isaac thinks I'm being an overbearing mother." She stopped. "Am I? Am I overbearing? Am I doing something wrong?" Her usual dull eyes became focused, clear. My wife said it felt like she was suddenly looking at a different woman.

"N-no, of course not." She stammered. "You're a wonderful mother, she's just a teenager."

Abi thanked my wife through a pressed smile, grateful for the reassuring words but unsure if she truly believed them. We didn't see much of the Yates after that.

When the body was found, Sophie tried to knock on their door with flowers but no one answered. There was a vague post on social media about a vigil but we didn't get an exact date.

We knew it was murder, but nothing else. The police asked us a few questions but we didn't have much to offer them. The community waited with bated breath for any shred of information on who could have done this.

A few days passed with no new information, until we received a text - one nobody saw coming. I still can't explain it. Despite being declared dead for several days, Veronica woke up. It was an astonishing shock to everyone, but the overwhelming joy we felt for the Yates family drowned out any lingering questions we had. Strangely, the story that gripped everyone's minds faded away almost overnight. Within weeks, it was as if no one wanted to remember. Conversations ran into silence, leaving behind some unspoken pact not to talk about it.

Sophie brought it up to her grief group, but was met with a swift change of subject. We couldn’t understand it. We never caught even a glimpse of Veronica, as she became more like a faint memory than a familiar face. Abi became more reclusive than she ever was. She was completely in shock, and not in a good way. It was understandable. Someone had tried to murder her daughter and was still living amongst us.

We didn't hear much of anything after that. We asked about Veronica occasionally but the only update we received was "she's still in recovery". That should have been a red flag but honestly, we were still so wrapped up in our own grief. I wish we'd left. As if it would even matter.

Sophie was driving to her parents. Everything was usual. She had been thinking a lot about Elijah that day, but that was normal. I shouldn't have let her go. God.

I was making my commute to work, radio tuned into the church. It almost felt like a snare had caught my ears. I have no idea why I kept listening to that racket, perhaps I just needed something to occupy my mind. The reverend, Malachy, was going on about something called the "core soul" when the signal broke.

"picking up- *static* from TFC, suspected broadcast. Synchronized with- *static* from unknown-"

The sound crackled back to the reverend. I fiddled with it in a vague attempt to "fix" it. It didn't fuzz anymore after that so I assumed it was fine. Weird, but whatever. I had been picking up all kinds of new signals since I got here so I didn't think too much about it at the time. I realised my phone was buzzing as I pulled into the school car park.

Sophie had an accident. They needed me to identify her.

I didn't even take a breath. I teared out of the car park, my mind racing like a greyhound as I drove to the scene. Ambulances were parked chaotically around a broken mess on the road. I felt my legs go numb. I forced myself out of my car onto unsteady feet, and began the walk forward. My chest tightened as reality began to sink in. It's not her, I kept telling myself. There's no way. They've made a mistake. A gray faced officer met with me.

"Mr Ober? Thank you for coming so quickly. This way." He lead me to her car, a tarp draped over it's crumpled chassis. White feathers swept up in the wind and twirled around me. The smell of metal and damp earth filled my nostrils.

"I'm going to lift up the tarp now, I need you to confirm that it's your wife." His teeth lightly clenched, the words he spoke unpleasant in his mouth.

He lifted it back and there she was. My beautiful Soph. She had been torn up, bloody entrails climbing away from her lower half. Her skull was cracked and warped, her face peaceful. Drool fell from her open mouth like a sleeping baby.

I couldn't speak, so I just sobbed. I sobbed uncontrollably on the floor. The people around me said comforting words, but I didn't hear them. I thought about her screaming in her last moments, then I realised it was me. I was screaming.

"I'm sorry Soph. I'm so sorry." Tears muffled my words quietly. They tried to hoist me to my feet but I collapsed back down into a broken pile. That was it.

They took her away. I sat in the back of an ambulance, a cup of coffee going cold in my hands. Calling Sophie's parents was impossible but I did it, sobbing through my words. They encouraged me to come by their house so I wouldn't be alone. We each sat around the dinner table with untouched plates. I thought of her face as I lay violently awake in their guest room that night.

The next few days were spent talking and crying with family. We had agreed on a date for the funeral. One afternoon I got a call from the police. I answered not thinking it could be any worse.

"Mr Ober, we have some... good news." An apprehensive tone marked the call. "It's your wife, she's... she survived."

"What?" I cut her off.

"She's alive. She's at St Micheal's Hospital. She's still in critical condition, but she's alive."

I was quiet. "What do you mean she's alive?"

"I'm afraid I can't give you much more information. You'll have to go to the hospital."

I hung up the phone. I'll be honest, in that moment I thought maybe it was a cruel joke. Thoughts whipped around my head as I put my coat and shoes on, dialing Sophie's parents.

The hospital was a bustling blur of hurried footsteps and anxious voices. Doctors, nurses and patients wove around each other in every direction. I slipped my way through the crowd to the front desk. The nurse barely looked up at me as she handed me a slip of paper with a ward and room number. My voice felt hollow as I called her parents to let them know I was at the hospital, and to relay what I'd been told.

After hanging up, I again began to tell myself that they'd made a mistake, that it couldn't possibly be her. I saw her organs dashed across the pavement like some brutal final act. She was cold, utterly lifeless.

The faint sound of pained wailing drew me to her room, a broken sound I immediately recognised as Sophie's voice. My chest ached as I neared the room, bracing myself for what lay inside.
A small group of nurses moved purposefully around her bed, absorbed in their tasks. Adjusting monitors, changing bandages and checking the web of equipment that surrounded her.

"Oh my god." The words escaping my mouth unconsciously, alerting the distracted nurses to my presence.

"Mrs Ober, your husband is here." The nurse could barely be heard over the screaming. Sophie's head was concaved, wrapped in a profusion of bloody bandages and gauze.

"Sophie! I'm here Soph." I blurted. All I got in response was a weak, agonising whine. I watched helplessly as the nurses administered injections, presumably painkillers.

"What is this?" I pleaded, my voice dripped in a fearful urgency as I gripped my wife's legs, desperate to give her comfort.

The nurses continued to work in busy silence, moving around me as if I were a ghost. Sophie's head, swollen and bruised, jerked involuntarily. Tears blurred my vision as I choked on the reality of the scene before me.

"Please Mr Ober, come this way." A doctor dragged me from her side.

"What's going on?" I begged.

"Your wife survived the accident. We don't know how." She tried to remain calm as she delivered the facts, but fear and confusion peeked between the gaps in her words. I looked once more at Sophie's mangled form, noticing her amputated limbs wriggling in pain.

"Please no, she was dead!"

"I know. We've done several scans and she's already had multiple surgeries to repair the internal damage but... only time will tell. We're doing everything we can." A bedpan crashed to the floor as Sophie's body thrashed reactively.

"We need you to do something for us."

They made me talk to her, asking her questions about us and our life to see how badly her brain was damaged. It devolved into me crying jumbled words at her as she screamed her throat raw. The only response I could get, mumbled through the sound of blood slapping between lips,

"The birds are picking at me."

 The doctors had to pull me away. When I got home I had to call Sophie's parents again. I told them she was "stable but will be in a little while longer". I told them the hospital wasn't accepting new visitors.

When she was awake, all she did was writhe, each breath extruding yelps of pain from her lungs. I cried all night at home until my eyes were raw. I felt guilty, like I should be there with her, but I just couldn't.

I returned to see her the next day. An unsettled feeling took hold as I entered her ward. New nurses, new signs, new patients. I quickened my pace as I traveled through the unfamiliar hall, heart pounding. I found my wife's bed stripped bare, the smell of iron still lingered. My stomach swelled with anxiety as all the possibilities washed around my head. I made my way back to the front desk.

My voice shook gently as I tried to keep my composure. "Excuse me, I'm looking my wife, Sophie Ober?"

"Down the hall." She didn't lift her head, gesturing down to a corridor.

I wandered down the hall sheepishly, trying not to get hit by gurneys as they rolled past. I began to feel like a lost child. I heard the sound of crying climbing softly down the halls, emanating from a nearby room. I approached and peeked around the door frame, into the room. The voice was familiar, it sounded young. I stepped into the almost barren room. The girl was wrapped up in so many bandages, I wondered how she could breathe. I stepped closer, now faintly recognising the voice.

"Veronica?"

She stirred but it seemed she had been sedated. I peered over her, trying to see her face. Against my better judgement, I gently shifted a loose bit of bandage away from her head. Underneath I saw a deep wound sitting on her neck. The smell hit me in the face instantly, like wet rocks and pumpkin seeds. It took me a moment to see the bugs. They buzzed angrily at being uncovered, before burrowing deeper into the wound.

I stumbled back horrified, quickly throwing the bandages back into place and leaving, my hand over my mouth. I forced myself to pretend I hadn't seen anything as I stumbled learily back down the hall. Through the haze swirling around me, I heard Sophie's voice. I rushed over to her room and practically fell to her side, clasping her hand between mine. Her body was exhausted, strained as it braced for more pain.

"We've given her some medication to sedate her. It doesn't always work, but..."

"Thank you." I replied, my focus glued to my wife. My eyes burrowed into hers, hoping to see a reflection of recognition. "I'm so sorry Soph. It'll be over soon, I promise." My words meant nothing but I hope they would bring some vague comfort to either of us. I held her hand tightly as my eyes stung.

Her head rolled over to meet my gaze, her eyes open. She saw me. I looked back at her, her eyes fixed on me. That was the last time I ever saw my wife. The beeps and hums of machines were shrouded out as she resumed her painful routine of twists and heart shattering cries. The nurse ran over to sedate her again.

I stood back, watching as the meds slowly reclaimed her consciousness. In that moment, the weight of suffering in that room gave way, collapsing into a dark hollow underneath.

Love is a powerful thing. It is often the sole reason for some of the most devastating decisions a human being can make. Like raging waters, it can overwhelm almost any barriers that lay in it's path. But sometimes, when love is crushed, squeezed and tested beyond its limits, it crumbles. It breaks. And what's left, is its most simple, rotten form. A humane act.

"Kill her. Giver her morphine, or something."

A slum of silence followed my words.

"We've tried. It doesn't work."

I stared at her in stunned silence. "What do you mean?"

"It doesn't work. She won't die. Nobody does anymore..." She mumbled her words as she watched Sophie's unconscious body twitch.

I turned back to see my wife laying still in a bed of damp pain. "I'll find a way to fix this." My voice cracked.

The days dragged and blended into each other as I sat at home waiting for any update on her condition. I couldn't face her anymore. Her parents called me everyday to see how she was and if we needed anything. I always told them the same thing as before - the hospital was really busy and they were only letting one person visit at a time, so they shouldn't need to visit her as I was there with her all the time.

Thoughts cannibalised my mind until I couldn't take it anymore. I needed some fresh air. I stopped at the garden centre as my feet wandered aimlessly through town, a bouquet of Irises catching my eye. They were Sophie's favourite. I picked them up.

"Seth?" Abi appeared behind me.

"Oh, hey Abi."

"Hey, how's it going? Picking up something for Soph?"

"Yeah... she's been in an accident."

"Oh. Nothing serious I hope?"

"She's okay... She'll be in for a little while longer though." I couldn't look her in the eye.

"Oh I'm sorry... Veronica's doing well. They said she might be discharged next week." A pitiful smile feigned across her lips. I didn't say anything.

I saw an advertisement plastered across the wall opposite us in the street. It's jarring words leapt out at me.

"Why do we suffer? Why don't we die?" The audacity of the question hung heavy in the air. Beneath it was a church website written in crude, bold text.

"What kind of advert is that?" I grunted out loud to myself. Abi followed my eyes to the sign.

"Oh it's probably just a typo. I imagine it's supposed to say why DO we die. The Pastor isn't very good with computers." I stared at it, committing the name of the church to memory. Trinity Fields Church.

Abi continued on. "You know, Pastor Chepi really is a prayer answered. He was so kind to us when..." Her voice cracked shakily. I planted the Irises back into the display.

When I got home I couldn't stop bouncing it around my head. Why don't we die. I booted up the computer and looked up their website. A sea of cheerful imagery flooded the screen. Bright colours and warm invitations. Nothing about death, nothing about the broadcasts I'd been hearing.

I clicked on a menu labeled "information". Instantly, over a hundred links branched out, each one titled something vague like "family" or "soul". I scrolled through them, skimming the pages. The sentiments expressed in the words were repetitive, sometimes nonsensical, and other times unsettling. Cryptic threats about consequences, veiled as loving reminders, permeated the website. I clicked on a page called "history" and was brought to an incredibly disorganised and frustrating article. Letters sprawled out across each other, and the words blurred together chaotically, making parts of it impossible to read. It was so distorted it might as well have been another language. I squinted at the screen, trying to piece together details that emerged form the clutter.

The church was founded in 1956 by someone referred to as M.H, and had suffered a major fire in 1961. Renovations took place, and it is now run by a Pastor Chepi. The church had a long legacy, with several names affixed to it. Each person had a dedicated section, outlining who they were and what they had done for the church. One in particular caught my eye.

It was dated 1956 and belonged to a man called Michael Dunelm who, at the time, was 37 years old. The paragraph described him as a generous man whose contribution had laid the very foundation for the church's existence. He was a visionary, raising walls and opening doors for the needy - his support turning ideas into a reality. At least, that's how the website painted it.

My curiosity piqued, I searched up his obituary - what I found instead, was that this bastard was still alive, being cared for in a home. He would have to be well over a hundred years old by now. Unconvinced, I began to comb through the obituaries by hand. His name kept appearing in places I didn't expect - the obituaries of his friends, one after another.

Lydia Hathoway 1901 - 1955

"Lydia especially beloved by my Jenny." - Michael Dunelm.

Another read:

John Grant 1887 - 1953

"John was a man you could rely on." - Michael Dunelm.

I carefully read through each of the obituaries until a pattern emerged. Every single obituary was dated before 1956. Those words on the advertisement gnawed on the back of my eyes like a thought that couldn't quite escape my mind.

I fell into a mind devouring routine. I would research obituaries until the early hours of the morning, sleep, then do it all again. Like a fever that wouldn't break. In the countless hours I spent scouring records, I only found 4 people who's death was dated after 1956. There were no loving messages etched into their graves by family, only dates.

After three days of this, I sat back in my office chair, crooked and tired. Perhaps I'd lost my mind. I hadn't had a hot meal for days. I was living off of stale cereal, and I'm pretty sure the milk spoiled a while ago. Was I constructing this elaborate conspiracy in my mind to distract myself from the unbearable truth that my wife could be dying and there was nothing I could do about it? Maybe. The only way to prove I wasn't crazy was to see Michael Dunelm himself. If answers existed, that's where they were.

I gripped the steering wheel, repeating my lines in my head as I pulled up outside the home. The afternoon sun soared like a beautiful eagle, crashing dead into the cold gray exterior of the nursing home. The building seemed to soak up any surrounding light or joy.

I stood outside the doors, sucking in one last breath of fresh air before I pushed them open. The receptionist flashed a brief smile at me.

"Excuse me, I'm here to see Michael Dunelm. He's my uh... great grandfather?" His gaze lingered on me, questioning me silently. He hovered his fingers over his keyboard.

"Uh, yes. May I ask your name?"

"Seth... Dunelm." I swallowed tightly.

He examined the details on his screen, the weight of silence getting unbearably heavier with each passing second. Finally he returned his gaze to me.

"Please go on through and wait in the lounge, I'll have the nurses bring him out."

I don't know what was harder to believe, that it worked, or that Michael Dunelm really was alive. I thanked the receptionist and made my way to the dusty old sitting room, trying to conceal my shaky confidence. I looked around at the mouldy beige walls and musty curtains as I took a seat in the corner of the empty room. Through a window, I saw an impossibly old man slumped in a wheelchair outside. His skin was raw from sunburn. I wasn't entirely sure if he was breathing.

These people weren't cared for. They were left here to rot, to be forgotten about. After what must have been at least 30 minutes of waiting, I heard people in the corridor outside. Silhouettes danced on the other side of the opaque glass before a nurse backed into the room, tugging a wheelchair along.

"Here we are Mr Dunelm, your son is here to see you." She pushed him into place opposite me. "Let me know if you need anything." She droned, pulling a fresh cigarette from her pocket as she turned to leave.

The man sitting opposite me was frail. His loose, sallow skin hung over his bones like fine silk. His eyes sat closed in dark hollow sockets. Embroidered on his pyjama shirt were two cursive letters: "M.D"

I sat for a second taking it in, raking my mind for what I had wanted to say.

"Mr Dunelm?"

Silence.

"I wanted to talk to you about something." I continued.

His laboured, heavy breathing was the only answer. I sat back in the uncomfortable chair. To be honest, I don't know what I was expecting. He was far too old to be receiving visitors, let alone conversing back to them. Regardless, I was satisfied. Michael Dunelm was alive. I sat, looking at him, watching his chest weakly inflate. His jaw hung open slightly, I wondered if I could poison him, and what would happen. I stoop up, abruptly catching myself in the thought. I needed to sleep.

When I finally stumbled through the door and collapsed into my bed, the weight of sleep quickly pulled me under. The dull ache of fatigue clung to my bones as I woke and made myself cereal. Yep, the milk had definitely spoiled now. I checked my landline for messages as I forced the last of the lumpy milk down my throat. Sophie's parents had called me several times.

Shit.

In my spiral into insanity I had forgotten to maintain my lie of going to the hospital everyday. Panic tightened in my chest as I scrambled to call them back, hoping they hadn't gone themselves. I lifted the phone to my ear, already dialing the numbers, when the crowded sound of a thousand conversations filled my ear. I pulled the phone away instinctively, but quickly pressed it back against my ear to listen to the sound. I could hear voices and words, but couldn't understand them. I suddenly felt like I shouldn't be listening, like I was intruding on a private conversation. I put the phone back down in it's receiver and lifted it again.

Hearing only the quiet buzzing of an empty line this time, I dialed up Sophie's parents. I got no answer but left a message explaining I had just been really tired and hadn't been at home much.

I returned to the blue glow of my computer, leaving the office door open this time so I could hear if they called again. This time I directed my focus towards Veronica. Whatever was happening to us, I knew it was happening to them too. There was no denying it, I had seen her state. Veronica was, much like my wife, declared dead. Yet she lives. How is that possible?

I examined her case, the investigation, the time frame of her disappearance, to her body being found, to her hospitalisation. Sources tangled with one another, butting heads on the facts and raising more questions than answers. I considered filing a Freedom of Information request to the police, but hesitated. Do I really want them to knowing I'm looking into this?

I checked Facebook for any drops of information that had fallen through the cracks. A pit of embarrassment fell in me when I realised I had been invited to a Facebook group called "Veronica's vigil". I hadn't even realised. Feeling guilty, I accepted the invitation and began browsing through the posts. The grieving messages broke my heart.

I stopped cold when I read a message mentioning her pregnancy. I checked back through articles I had saved, and sure enough at the very bottom of one of the articles I found it.

"Veronica Yates was four months pregnant at the time of her death."

In that moment I realised I hadn't thought about Elijah since the accident.
