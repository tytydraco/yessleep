# Title: The Night I Met the Shadow Man

# Part 1: The Beginning

It was a chilly October evening in 2018, and I had just moved to Seattle, Washington, for a new job. I was excited to explore the city, especially the eerie beauty of the Pacific Northwest. My apartment was in Capitol Hill, an area known for its vibrant nightlife and eclectic vibe. Little did I know, this place would soon become the backdrop of a harrowing encounter.

That night, I decided to take a stroll down Broadway. The neon lights flickered above, and laughter echoed from nearby bars. I loved the energy of the city, but I was also acutely aware of my surroundings. I had heard stories about the darker side of Seattle—missing persons cases, homeless encampments, and tales of the infamous Green River Killer, Gary Ridgway, who had preyed on vulnerable women in the 1980s. But I brushed those thoughts aside, convincing myself I was safe in the crowded streets.

As I walked, I noticed a man standing on the corner near a coffee shop. He seemed out of place, wearing a long black coat, his face obscured by the shadows. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me. I picked up my pace, deciding to head home. But as I turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of him smirking. It sent a shiver down my spine.

# Part 2: The First Encounter

A few nights later, I was out again, this time with a couple of new friends from work. We ended up at a dive bar on 12th Avenue called The Comet Tavern, famous for its cheap drinks and live music. The atmosphere was lively, and I quickly forgot about the strange man from my previous walk.

After a few rounds, I stepped outside to get some fresh air. It was around midnight, and the streets were quieter. As I leaned against the wall, I noticed the same man from before, leaning against a lamppost across the street. My heart raced; he was staring right at me. I quickly darted back inside, but not before I saw him push off the lamppost and start walking toward me.

Feeling a surge of panic, I rejoined my friends and tried to act casual. But when I glanced back outside, the man was gone. I convinced myself it was just a coincidence, but the nagging feeling of unease lingered.

# Part 3: The Deeper Shadows

Days turned into weeks, and life settled into a routine. I focused on work and making friends, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. The shadow man seemed to haunt my thoughts, and every time I stepped outside, I scanned the streets for him.

Then came Halloween weekend, 2018. Seattle was buzzing with excitement, and I planned to attend a costume party in Ballard. Dressed as a witch, I felt bold and spirited, ready to enjoy the festivities. As I arrived at the party, I quickly forgot my worries, drinking and dancing with friends.

But around 1 AM, I stepped outside for a breather. The streets were dimly lit, and a heavy fog rolled in, adding an eerie touch to the night. That’s when I saw him again—the shadow man, lurking in the fog, a few blocks down. My heart raced, and I felt frozen in place.

Before I could react, he turned and began walking toward me. I darted back inside, but the chill from the outside clung to me. I told my friends what happened, and they laughed it off, but I could see the concern in their eyes. “Maybe it’s time to get a pepper spray,” one suggested. I promised myself I would.

# Part 4: The Trap

The next few weeks flew by, and I barely thought about the man anymore—until Thanksgiving, when I decided to go for a late-night walk to clear my head. I walked to Volunteer Park, where the trees cast long shadows in the moonlight. As I wandered, I felt an intense sensation of being followed. Every rustle of leaves sent my heart racing.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned, but there was no one there. I quickened my pace, but the footsteps grew louder. Panic set in. I picked up my phone, ready to call someone, but my battery was dead. I was utterly alone.

Just as I reached the park’s exit, I saw him—standing just beyond the trees, his face now partially illuminated by the moonlight. His eyes were cold, and he had an unsettling smile that twisted my stomach. I felt paralyzed, rooted to the spot.

“Hey there,” he called out, his voice smooth yet chilling. “Why don’t you come a little closer?”

“No!” I shouted, turning to run. I sprinted through the park, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear him following, his footsteps growing faster. I dashed into a nearby neighborhood, praying for safety.

# Part 5: The Escape

After what felt like an eternity, I spotted a house with lights on and knocked frantically. A middle-aged woman opened the door, concern flooding her face. “What’s wrong?”

“Please, someone is chasing me!” I gasped, looking back into the darkness. She let me inside and locked the door behind me. I could still hear faint footsteps in the distance, but they were fading.

The woman called the police while I collapsed onto the couch, trembling. They arrived shortly after, taking my statement. As I recounted the events, I saw the skepticism in their eyes. “Are you sure it wasn’t just someone playing a prank?” one officer asked.

I could only shake my head. “No, it felt real.”

# Part 6: The Aftermath

In the days that followed, I was a bundle of nerves. I installed security cameras in my apartment and avoided going out alone at night. My friends noticed the change in me and rallied around, making sure I never felt alone.

One afternoon, while scrolling through local news, I stumbled upon a chilling article. A woman had gone missing in Capitol Hill just days after my encounter. The police had no leads, but the description of the last person seen with her—a tall man in a black coat—sent chills down my spine.

The shadow man was real. And he was still out there.

# Part 7: The Conclusion

As winter settled in, I decided to leave Seattle, moving back to my hometown. I needed distance from the memories that haunted me. The shadow man became a ghost of my past, but the fear remained.

A few months later, I heard news that the police had finally captured a suspect connected to the string of disappearances. They revealed his name: **John Doe**, an unassuming man who had lived in Seattle for years, blending into the crowd. He was charged with multiple counts of kidnapping and murder.

I could hardly breathe when I saw his picture—it was him. The shadow man.

Looking back, I realized how lucky I was to have escaped that night. The city I once loved now felt tainted. I moved on, but the memory of that encounter remained etched in my mind, a chilling reminder of how darkness can lurk just beyond the light.

Stay safe, everyone. Always trust your instincts.
