*Based on my true experience*

By [Ringo Cross](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/2hRjs9OdKZ)

It had been a lengthy flight from my hometown of Detroit to the bustling city of New York. How did I even end up on this journey? Phew. Long story for another day. A tale that I still find difficult to believe. What the hell. I guess things happen for a reason, you know. Well at least that’s what I keep telling myself to feel better about this. It’s funny in a twisted kind of way. I thought I knew not to make promises I couldn’t keep.

I was surprised and a bit unprepared for how long the flight lasted. I don’t know why, but for some reason, I thought the two cities were much closer. I couldn’t have been more wrong or more irritated about being wrong. The one saving grace was that I had been given a nice comfy seat in business class. Now I could at least ruminate in opulence and maybe even parcel my decision into one nice and neat mental package, I reminded myself as I thought about my situation quite bitterly.

This individual who I was going to meet. I still had no idea who he was or why he took pity on my soul. I was just an ordinary guy. I mean yeah. I could string together a few sentences, but that’s about it. Wrest the pen from my hand, and I was nothing more than a depressed failure. It burned me to admit it, but a promise was a promise. And I swore a long time ago that I’d never lie to myself, no matter how distracting or tempting the lie.

I was picked up by his chauffeur at the airport. The driver was an older gent who was curt but courteous. Can’t say I blame him, given his employer. He looked at me every now and again with a curious eye. I didn’t mind. Hell. I’d probably do the same if I were him. Plus, I was far too busy marveling at the city and its people.

His office was somewhere in Midtown Manhattan. That’s all I am allowed to say. I would hate to lead anyone else into the arms of darkness. Neither would the man behind the mask be delighted to have uninvited strangers knocking on his front door. The last thing I wanted to do was draw his ire. Like I said, I won’t say where, but I will reveal a few details. His *penthouse* was in the heart of the Plaza District. In one of the more iconic *towers.*

A bellhop was waiting for me at the main entrance. He introduced himself and told me that he had been assigned the task of escorting me. He asked if I had any questions. Oh, I had plenty, just none for him. He smiled and told me he understood, before guiding me to the elevator. He used a key to unlock a certain floor. A number I will not mention for what I hope are obvious reasons. Before I exited, I apologized and told him I didn’t have any money for a tip. He thanked me and told me not to worry because it had already been taken care of.

I made my way towards the front desk, greeted his secretary, and informed her that I was here to see the Broker. She looked at me with a raised eyebrow. Like I was lost, or there had been some kind of mix-up, and I was on the wrong floor. I dug into my pocket and handed her his business card as proof that I wasn’t lying.

She glared at it for a moment, before glaring at me for a while. “How did you get this?”

“It’s a long story, ma’am.”

“So, you do have an appointment?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Give me a minute—I have to—” she blurted as she abruptly made her way to the back.

The lobby was styled in what appeared to be Roman décor. The walls were decorated in white, green, and gold plaster. The floor was covered in fine mosaics that depicted the Roman gods in various forms of mischief and solemnity. There were sculptures, stools, and paintings. It all looked crazy expensive, like it had been imported from some specialty shop in Italy.

His secretary returned right when I was in the middle of admiring an ivory figurine of Orcus. She waved me in and then guided me through the penthouse, or what she called the “atrium.” His office was all the way in the back. Of course, I couldn’t help but glance around the condo and ask questions. The place was decked out in modern décor, which was in stark contrast to the lobby.

There was a ton of open space, glass walls, large windows with a view of the District Plaza, and various antiques from the Late Middle Ages. Near the bar was a French shield with the fleur-de-lis royal crest and a Milanese suit-of-armor.

Another thing that struck me was the mood of his secretary. How she had essentially gone from cold to warm in her treatment of me. Instead of glowering sourly at me like I was a lost soul, like she did when I first arrived, she seemed much more polite and relaxed.

We even managed to strike up a brisk conversation about my hometown, the long flight here, and if I was comfortable with the agreement. She introduced herself as “Katie” and apologized for the delayed greeting, which we both found oddly amusing given the situation.

I stole a deep breath when we reach the door to his office. The black door sign simply read “The Broker” in gold. Her smile not only reassured me but helped to soothe my frayed nerves. And our brief convo just a moment ago worked wonders on my jittery mind. This is it, I thought to myself as I fought the urge to run.

She knocked twice before punching in the code “1318” and opening the door. I took another deep breath before stepping inside. Luckily, he already knew who I was, but still allowed me to be introduced out of formality. He thanked Katie before dismissing her rather casually. I took a seat in front of his desk as directed. Here I was sitting face-to-face with the Broker. An illusive man whose invitation I had rebuffed for so long.

Soft classical music played in the background. The lights were dim but robust enough to make out his subtle features. I studied his eyes, like someone studying the eyes of “The Fallen Angel” for the first time. He was clean-shaven, had short dark hair that was greased back, and a soft, pale complexion. It looked like the very fibers of his being had been sewn together by God.

I tore my eyes away from the mystery in front of me when I noticed the mystery behind him. A wall painting with very refined, neoclassical renderings typical of academic art. The only gap was for the fireplace and French doors that led to his private terrace.

He followed my eyes, saw what I was admiring, and remarked, “An expensive undertaking, right there. I had the entire piece moved to my office brick by brick, not too long ago actually.”

“It’s beautiful.”

“Would you believe me if I told you that it was done by an angel?”

“No. No, I wouldn’t.”

He laughed under his breath when I said that. Taking my doubts in stride, he reached under his desk, grabbed a leather case from the drawer, and removed two cigars from a velvet and blood orange container.

When I accepted his offer and took one of them out of his waiting hand, he said, “The rare and lovely Gurkha Black Dragon. Given to me by none other than The Dragon, ironically. It was a gift to commemorate a task that had been a long time in the making.”

“What did you finish?”

“Should you really be indulging given your illness?” he asked with narrowing eyes.

“One cigar won’t hurt.”

“Smoking is so passé.”

“How did you know?”

“Know about what?”

“About my disease.”

“Information is my forte, Mr. Cross.”

“Who are you?”

“I go by many names.”

“Sounds pretty cliché.”

“I’m not *him* if that’s what you’re wondering.”

“Never said you were.”

“Let me ask you something.”

“Fire away,” I told him.

“What if I were this cliché, you assume me to be? You think we’d be having this conversation? As if I’d care about your situation?”

“No. Not at all.”

He paused to enjoy his cigar. “Ah. I forget how tart these taste at the beginning. They may start off bitter, but like anything else worth having, they get better over time until they’re as sweet as heaven.”

“I *need* more time.”

“I know. I know.”

“Can you help me?”

“Maybe. Maybe not.”

“What does that—"

“Have you ever noticed that no matter what you do. No matter how hard you fight. You can’t escape the feeling that something’s watching you? Something sinister that always strikes when you least expect it.”

“Murphy’s law?”

“Not exactly.”

“Then what?”

“Power.”

“Elaborate.”

“The human experience can be broken down into three things. Fear, survival, comfort. Without the first you cannot have the second. And without the second you can’t have the third. It’s hardwired into your brain.”

“Is that how your organization works?”

“I assume you mean the Illuminati?”

“Yes.”

“No. Power like that is tricky.”

“How so?”

“We’re not anarchist or idealist. We’re not even some monolithic force who wants to destroy the world simply for the sake. No. Not at all. We’re far worse. With the will and the mind to succeed this time.”

“The end times, right?”

His scowl revealed that my question was beneath him. Not even bothering with semantics, he stood from his chair and loosened up his gold cufflinks. Then he grabbed a bottle of wine and two glasses off the mantel.

“How many people can say they drank with an angel? Chateau Lafite Rothschild, no less. A cabernet sauvignon given to me by one of the families.”

“Is that what you are?”

“A fallen angel? Yes.”

“And you work for *him?”*

This time he smirked instead of scowling when he ignored my rhetorical question. He poured wine into the glasses and casually offered me one.

When I accepted, he stared at me for a moment without saying a word. I wish I knew what he was thinking. I wish I could say for sure that he was a friend and not a foe. Alas, it was too late for second thoughts, I thought to myself as I took a sip from the glass.

He must’ve read my mind. Because he leaned back in his chair and asked, “What are you willing to sacrifice?”

“What do you want?”

“Depends.”

“My children are off limits.”

My statement amused but didn’t shock him. He leaned up in his seat and let the ashes from his cigar fall into the ashtray. “Why would I want that?”

“So you can sacrifice them.”

“Interesting. Well, Mr. Cross, contrary to popular belief, we don’t sacrifice children. Particularly not the offspring of those who work for us.”

“That’s reassuring.”

“We need you to be of sound mind if you plan to do our biding. We can’t have sniveling, grief-stricken employees under our care. Bad for business.”

“Then what does evil want?”

“The true eyes of evil are unlike anything you’ve ever encountered. Heh. Strange rituals are the last thing on my mind or in our eyes.”

“That’s good to know.”

“You seem tense.”

“Why wouldn’t I be?”

“Lighten up, Mr. Cross. It’s probably smart to keep me in a good mood as we bargain.”

“And how do I do that?”

“Would you like another?”

“I haven’t even finished this one.”

“Try this. It’s to die for.”

“Thanks. What is it called?”

“King of Denmark.”

“Nice. Really nice cigar.”

He took one for himself from the expensive wooden case that had ‘The Broker’ engraved on it. After firing it up, he handed me the lighter. I examined the odd pattern and ran my thumb across the intricate golden grooves. It was obvious he liked luxury. I could tell just by looking at all the vintage décor in his office.

The fresco behind him was a sight to behold. Maybe it was done by an angel like he claimed. But then again, my taste in artwork was amateurish. Who knows, maybe he was bluffing like you would in a good game of poker.

“How do you get away with it?”

“Get away with what?”

“The Illuminati.”

“It’s not as difficult as you assume.”

“What do you mean?”

“People would rather believe a lie than the truth.”

“That’s dark.”

He waited for me to finish my glass before offering me another. I accepted his offer. After filling my glass to the brim, he peered into my eyes and said, “You know the angels are not as kind as you think.”

“What about them?”

He took a sip of wine and then paused for a moment to enjoy his cigar. There was a hint of anger in his eyes. What I saw was enough to make the hair on the back of my neck stand. He noticed my discomfort and transformed his ire into a suave smirk. The glimpse may have disappeared, but I could still hear it in his tone:

“I understand the true nature of your kind almost as much as I do my own. What you are, who you are, and most importantly what it means to be human. I know this better than anyone. But the others... those who decided to remain. It took them a very long time to understand. Even now, they struggle to grasp the finer details of your nature. Like inequality. An idea they’ll never get.”

“Why do you say that?”

“It’s one of the reasons we rebelled. Those of us who couldn’t see spending the rest of eternity breaking our backs to ensure you lived privileged lives.”

“What’s so bad about that?”

“First chance you get. You take what we’ve given and divide it amongst yourselves as if it were the spoils of war. To this day, the angels that remained cannot understand why you separate yourselves into the haves and the have nots when there is plenty.”

“The privileged and unprivileged. Huh. Didn’t know you guys were bleeding hearts,” I said with a sly smirk before taking a puff from my cigar.

“You find that jest worthy?”

“No. Of course not. What do you mean, when you say, ‘the angels that remained’? Are you referring to the good angels who remained loyal and didn’t rebel?”

“Yes.”

“Why did you rebel?”

“Think about it. A third of us turned our backs to heaven. That’s not an insignificant number. Do you honestly think it was flattery and charm that persuaded us to fight? His point about salvation and how unworthy you are to receive such a gift resonated with us all.”

“But why do it?”

“It’s complicated.”

“That’s a cop out.”

“Do you know why the Devil scares you?”

“Other than the fact that he’s evil incarnate?”

“He’s not evil. He was the only one who dared to say to God what everyone else was already thinking when he elevated your kind and made us your servants.”

“Why do you say that?”

“Because if he’s not evil, what does that make the God you praise? That’s the thing that scares you the most, isn’t it? That the God you believe in is just as bloodthirsty and cunning as him.”

“At least he’s not a madman.”

“Padded shackles are still shackles.”

“So, you think God is a tyrant?”

“Absolute power is absolute power even if the person wielding the scepter is benevolent.”

“Tell me more about the fresco.”

“What is it you’d like to know?”

“You said it was done by an angel?”

“Correct. An old friend of mine, Raphael. If only he would have joined our side and fought for our cause. His art would have inspired a new wave of malcontent. Ah. I suppose you can’t always have your cake.”

“How did you come by it?”

“That’s a long story. Let’s just say I didn’t come by it peacefully. Let’s also say that I stripped it off the walls of a place ‘holier-than-thou.’”

“Really? You did that?”

“Maybe I’ll send you the details one day. I’m sure it’ll make for a grand story.”

“Why would you put a painting that was done by one of the good guys on your wall? That’s strange.”

“Art is art, no matter the artist.”

“So, you’re a pragmatist?”

“I don’t know, Mr. Cross. Are you sure you want more time? I’ve bargain with plenty of desperate men. And you don’t strike me as one of them.”

“Why wouldn’t I be sure?”

“Hmm. I don’t know.”

“What are you getting at?”

He drew a large puff from his cigar while staring at the statue in the corner of his office. It was another masterpiece. A sculpture of a warrior angel without wings. Those eyes. I swear they were following me. And the armor, oh my, was it unlike anything I’d ever seen.

It was uncanny to see so much light surround someone so dark. What made it even worse was that you’d never know he was a devil by his charming appearance. After letting out another cloud of smoke, he finally shared what was on his mind, or at least part of it: “I know your type. Hyper rational. Thorny. Somber. The type who knows what they want but is miserable when they get it.”

“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.”

“Hah. Humans... always opining and pining with your grubby little fingers for the things you can’t have. That’s the thing about you. The other thing that makes you highly unlikable. You complain and swear up and down, how *badly* you want something. But when you finally get it. Whatever the thing was you were looking for... all you ever do is tarnish it, like the soul within you, you treat like a piece of cheap jewelry.”

“Great. This isn’t one of those ‘be careful what you wish for’ speeches, is it?”

“Everything has a price, Mr. Cross.”

“What if it’s free?”

“Heh. Things that are free usually cost the most. Like freedom.”

“Which brings me back to my original question. What is it that you want me to sacrifice?”

“That depends on what you’re willing to give.”

“Really?”

“Yes, really. I can’t make you give what you don’t want to give. That’s not how this works. That’s why it’s called bargaining.”

“Can I even trust you to keep your word?”

“What do you think?”

“Evil is as evil does.”

“You think you know us, don’t you?”

“What the hell does that mean?”

“One ‘Sermon on the Mount,’ and you think you know? Your parents warned you not to whisper to the shadows when they whispered back. Or maybe some self-righteous preacher in a nice suit, delivered a speech, and now you think you know who we are. Go on, believe all you want. But just know this, we haven’t come to dominate your world by coincidence. How else do you think we did it?” he inquired with a smirk that could kill a priest.

“Through fear and violence.”

He chuckled under his breath a bit and said, “We sell the disease not the cure, Mr. Cross.”

“Well, I’ll tell you one thing. I’m not burning in hell for all eternity if that’s what you want.”

“We don’t burn the useful.”

“What do you do to them?”

“Tell you what. I’ll scratch that one off the list if it’ll ease your mind,” he winked.

“Thanks.”

“Any other deal-breakers?”

“No.”

“Excellent.”

“Is there a contract?”

“No contract.”

“Really? No pact in blood?”

“Heh. You read too many novels.”

“So, my word is all you need?”

“Exactly.”

“Something doesn’t feel right.”

“It shouldn’t”

“But you just said—”

“Wait a minute,” he said before closing his eyes and listening to the music softly playing over the loudspeaker. “Ah. Yes. Here comes my favorite part. The crescendo and that cantata... *mwah!* It never gets old and always reminds me of home.”

After the song ended, I asked him if he knew the name of it. With a serpentine smile, he said, “Ah. Good old *Carmina Burana: O Fortuna,* composed by someone else who made a Faustian bargain.”

“Faustian bargain?”

“Never mind this,” he said as he reached into his drawer and pulled out an old cigarette case. I could tell without asking that they were expensive. He offered me one and again I accepted without hesitation.

“You do know what we want, right?”

“Not to sound like a smart ass, but if I knew I wouldn’t have asked you all those times.”

“Think about it for a moment.”

“Why when you can just tell me.”

“Why do you think we allow potential clients to foolishly offer up their souls?”

“How would I know?”

“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we don’t really need it. Even if we did, you’re probably going to hell anyway for your sins.”

“I’m not Christian.”

“Who what have guessed.”

“I’m glad you find that funny.”

“Sorry, Mr. Cross. I’m just having a bit of fun at your expense. I get your point. Believers are some of my best clients, I’m afraid.”

“That’s sad.”

“Good and evil are closer than you think.”

“How close?”

“Very.”

“That’s a frightening thought.”

“Now you’re starting to see.”

“You know you still haven’t answered my question. Or the question you asked me about soul selling. I’m starting to think your trying to jerk me around.”

“Hah. Hold on to that intensity. You’re going to need it if you plan on fulfilling your end of the bargain. Now, as to why we allow mortals to bargain with us. It’s simple. Unlike the good guys, we don’t have the luxury of time.”

“I don’t follow you.”

“You Americans enjoy capitalism, right?

“Yeah, I guess so.”

“I’ll put it into perspective for you. Think of Evil as a corporation. And like any well laid company, we need employees... souls who are clever enough to carry out our mission with a certain level of panache.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes. And since I’m already being frank. I think you’ll make a wonderful employee.”

“And I don’t have to give you anything I’m not comfortable giving?”

“That is correct. Your word and a simple handshake will suffice, for now at least.”

“What if I change my mind in the future? What if I wake up one day and give my life over to God? What if I accept Christ as my Savior?”

“I’d be careful if I were you. You can always renege, but you might not go to heaven. You might be stuck with us. And I’m sure trying to explain why you broke the terms of our deal won’t go over too well.”

“So what? It won’t matter if I repent. The Bible says that all sins can be forgiven.”

“Except for sins against the Holy Spirit. He really doesn’t like those who blaspheme her name.”

“Her?”

“Yes.”

“Hmm.”

“Oh, and a word of advice on absolution: God may be merciful, yes. But even his forgiveness has its limits. Trust me, I know.”

“How so?”

“You think Hitler would have gotten into Heaven if he repented right before he died?”

“No.”

“Exactly.”

“He’s with you guys, huh?”

“Yup. In Hell, right where he belongs. Suffering every waking moment. The belligerent fool should have listened to us. We gave him power and he turned around and used what we gave him to commit genocide,” he said before pausing for a moment to sigh in regret. “Like Nero, he succumbed to all the trappings of absolute power on earth: Drugs, boozes, gambling, lechery, devilry, banditry.”

“So, Nero is as bad as they say?”

“Worse. His cruel treatment of Christians even made us blush. And for his crimes, for breaking the bargain, the fool will forever burn,” he said rather hatefully.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“Sorry,” he replied.

“It’s cool. I get it.”

“Where was I? Ah, yes, Nero. The woodenheaded bohemian did more to popularize the Christian faith than the preachings of any wiseman or prophet.”

“So, Nero and Hitler were you guys’ doing, huh? Hah. Why am I not surprised. I wonder how many others can credit their ‘success’ to you guys?”

He kicked his feet up on the desk and sighed. “More than I care to imagine. On the dark side, we learned from our previous failures.”

“Learned what?”

“You can’t force the issue of the false prophet. Conditions will determine when the time is right. You see, because our setbacks, we realized what was arguably our most valuable lesson.”

I took a drag from my cig and said, “Oh, really? And what lesson is that?”

He turned his head and thought deeply for a moment. It couldn’t have been my question that pulled his mind into reminiscent darkness. It had to be something far worse. He looked over at me with a shadowy smile and said, “It’s impossible to take over the world by force. The human mind will always resist oppression.”

“Humph. Interesting.”

“Since the beginning, we’ve tried to take over your world and failed. Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Qin Shi Huang, Genghis Khan. So many we’ve bargained with only for it to end in failure. For too long, we waged war in plain sight. And all we managed to do was create a desert where there was an oasis. Now that we’ve learned from our mistakes, we wage silent wars. And because of this, in just seventy years, we’ve done more to bring about the end times than we’ve done in three millennium.”

“How do you do it now?”

“Through banking.”

“Banking? Really?”

“No war was ever won by a pauper.”

“So, you’re a banker?”

“You could say that.”

“Wow. Who would’ve guessed?”

“Tell me about it,” he said before taking a sip of wine. Then with a smirk, he added, “Oh how the mighty have fallen. Reduced to simple commerce and scheme. It was *his* idea you know. Which came as something of a surprise to us all, given his fiery reputation.”

“Let me get this straight. All I have to do is give you my word? That’s it. No trickery? No rituals? I don’t have to slaughter a lamb or anything?”

“Yup. That’s it.”

“And I’ll get more time?”

He took out his planner and jotted down a date. Then he looked over at me and said, “We’re not holy. I can’t promise you a miracle, but I’ll put in a good word for you with the boss. I like you. You have an interesting sense of humor if you know what I mean.”

“I don’t. Was that a compliment?”

“Heh. Nice doing business with you, Mr. Cross,” he said with an extended hand.

“Thank you. I think.”

“Spread our message.”

“I’ll try my best.”

“Oh, you’ll do more than try.”

“What does that mean?”

“Failure isn’t an option.”

“Just hold up your end of the bargain.”

“Hopefully, our next encounter won’t be for a very long time. For your sake, Mr. Cross. Oh, and my secretary has something for you. A parting gift if you will.”
