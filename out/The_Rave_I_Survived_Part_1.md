Again and again, I've recorded these events. Over and over, my therapist has pushed me to "Try again." I've gone over these memories so many times that I remember them better than my childhood. Not that there's much to remember. I never cared much for milestones or understood the significance of 'firsts.' First bike: don't remember. First ballet class: can't even remember what state we lived in.

First kiss, though? That I remember. Nothing about the kiss was important. I can barely remember the other participant. What I do remember is getting their shoes. That was the deal, after all, one kiss in exchange for two sneakers. They had spent every day on the playground following me around like my little brother. But they had these beautiful black shoes with little white rabbits on the heels. I never saw them in class after that. No one ever came asking me about the missing shoes.

I was shocked to see another pair just like them years later.

It was another warm night. The type of night that made me rejoice in my nocturnal predilections. I ended up at a trendy club. The club featured four stories. A narrow main floor packed with bars and a DJ hidden above the entrance. The second floor mainly had stairs, with one little alcove for another bar that overlooked the first floor and a tiny dance floor for the lowest rank DJ of the night. The third floor was the quietest (which still wasn't that quiet.) The business bros and bridal parties usually ended up here. The last floor was the basement. Most of the floor's length was dedicated to high-backed booths set against shifting dim lights. At the far end of the basement was a small dance floor and yet another bar. The basement typically featured more complex and hypnotic techno and future bass music. You usually felt the basement before you heard it. Two steps past the landing, the floor vibrated against feet.

I loved the basement. It was busy without being crowded. The dance floor was active, but there was room on it to actually move should I find myself with so few inhibitions.

I recall having just gotten my third vodka-cranberry. Maybe it was my fourth. I found an unoccupied booth in the basement where I could sit down for a moment. Nearby, a group of girls discussed how dull they were. Or maybe it was about how drunk they were. That would make more sense.

Either way, they irritated me. A gaggle of girls reveling in their semi-annual night out. They were acting as if their statuses were elevated merely for being out at a trendy club.

They were tourists. They were annoying.

Laugh after laugh grated through my ears. I can remember the shades of red swimming in my eyelids as I tried to control my breath. When I finally opened my eyes, I saw them, two little white rabbits bouncing over the hardwood.

My heart raced at the sight of those shoes. They were cute as I remembered them, but they weren't supposed to be here. Through the haze of color-changing lights, I watched the wearer walk down the hall. They were tall with light hair that was an effortlessly styled mess. While stylish, they dressed like a former punk.

I didn't have a plan, but I knew I needed to talk to them. I abandoned my drink at the low table with the green underlights. I controlled my pace, to walk and not run down the narrow hall full of tilting people. I couldn't shake the crawling frustration that I was too slow.

The archway that marked the lounge area from the bar remained a distant window. How had those rabbits already vanished from my sight? I went as far as to lengthen my stride. I seemed to be stuck in place. I reminded myself running would only draw unneeded attention or worse. I swallowed hard around the palpating heart stuck in my throat.

"It's getting late," someone said in my ear. I turned to see my reflection in a pair of sunglasses.

"It's not," I protested, eliciting a look of surprise.

"Have you already forgotten?"

"How am I supposed to know?"

The lips below the sunglasses laughed. "Time jumps forward tonight."

"Ph. I had forgotten. Do you think I could stop it?" I asked.

"Stop it? You?" The sunglasses sized me up, and in their reflection, I could see just how easily missed I was. "Perhaps." I was shocked but emboldened by the non-answer.

"I need to get to the bar over there." I pointed at the end of the hall.

"That's easy," came the chuckling reply. "It's easier if you walk with your right hand near the chairs." A glinting decorated hand gestured at the booths that flanked us. "Everything is easier if you swim with the flow." I nodded my thanks to the sunglasses and sidled to the right so I was close to the packed booth of people chanting around a bucket of ice.

Sure enough, it was easier.

I passed under the framed transition and was on the dance floor. It was busy, but there was still enough space for authentic dancers. A familiar whiff of euphoria brought a casual smirk to my lips.

Desperate, I glanced at the bar. Bouncing against the footrest under the counter was one of the rabbits, the other sitting calmly on the floor near it. I composed myself and approached the bar. I placed a hand on the sticky surface and repressed the urge to recoil. When the owner of the shoes looked my way, they didn't so much register me as they did a change in their surroundings. Their eyes lacked that predatory gleam I saw in so many late at night. They were a hare among wolves -composed and alert but at peace with the chaos that didn't pose any threat.

When my mere presence didn't prove bait enough, I cleared my throat and let my panicked charm interject. "What would you say if I offered to kiss you for your shoes?" My voice formed the words like cursive on a fancy invitation. Internally, I screamed. I hadn't been aware of how much that old memory was floating around my head until it emerged as an aborted flirt. Yet they laughed. 

"I'm interested, but I just got these." They leaned back and hovered one foot out to show them off. They looked a bit beaten up to be brand new.

"Where'd you get them?" I said in a desperate attempt to keep the conversation going. That seemed like the type of thing people asked regularly.

"I found them secondhand." That smile was so effortless.

"Oh, mine too." I imitated their posture and showed off one of my Chelsea boots.

"Those look sick."

"Thank you."

As we returned firmly to the ground, I brushed a strand of hair behind my ear. "Are you trying to get a drink?" Rabbit asked. The question came after a beat of silence that felt like a dropped heartbeat.

"Just water," I said. The rabbit caught the bartender's attention with a simple gesture, somehow drawing attention easier than the boisterous groups spattered around the bar waving wildly. My water came, and it was sweet. I had become incredibly dehydrated.

"I haven't heard this one before," the rabbit comments idly. Their attention drifts away, head bobbing with the music. The bass line was syncopated, delivering consistent but surprising hits over an expertly tuned kick.

"It's Sleep Noise," I said.

Rabbit laughed. "That makes sense."

So they knew Sleep Noise.

"I got to see them last summer."

"No shit!" Their eyes lit up. "Did I just miss them? Where were they playing? Sound Stage, Lion's Paw?" I shook my head. My cheeks felt like they were on fire. 

"I saw them on the West Coast." The rabbit's head tilted; they were curious. "I'm from out of town," I added.

"Oh?" Their warm encouragement was all I needed.

"I'm out here for a few months for work."

"Must be for something cool."

I shrug, "I've done worse for less."

"How much longer will you be in the area?"

"The project just started, so at least another five weeks."

"Cool. Cool." Rabbit nodded. "You seem a bit too cool for a place like this." I remember at that moment, my heartbeat was louder than the swelling bass, and I hoped I was the only one who could hear it.

"This place is alright; at least down here, they have something more than pop top 40s." Rabbit's laugh made me laugh.

"There's an actual rave happening Saturday. It's a bit of a drive."

"Yeah?" It was my turn to encourage details.

"It's by a local group; they put together good events." I nodded. "Not entirely legal events." Rabbit's bright eyes sparkled in the flashing lights. I was acutely aware my reaction was being judged. I let my smile widen ever so slightly and leaned in close, almost empty glass to my lips. "It's about an hour by the freeway in the next city over, just outside one of the more industrial areas."

"Sounds fun," was all I had to say.

"I'd be happy to send you details," Rabbit said.

"I'd like that."

"I could put my number in your phone," Rabbit said. I had to sheepishly admit I didn't bring my phone with me. There were about a dozen reasons, but I didn't feel like enumerating them. "I get it; I don't either," Rabbit admitted in turn. I laughed first this time. Rabbit once more got the bartender's attention, this time only for a scrap of paper from the register and a pen.

I eventually lost the note, but I can still remember it. It had a phone number and a hasty doodle of a rabbit.
Then it happened. Caring little for whatever interference I could have mustered, the clock sprung its nasty surprise. DJs warned of the last call and the looming change of the hour. "Shit, I need to get going." I gave a light pout in response. "Text me," Rabbit said with a wave before leaving. I watched as the crowd consumed them like some filter-feeding behemoth.

——————

The next morning, I got ready for work in a haze. The project was at least a change of pace, but it was still work. Eventually, I got to sit down at the desk that had been designated as mine for the duration of the project. It provided me enough time to send out a text.

Hey! Didn’t lose your number.
me 11:03am

Good job!
Rabbit 1:16pm

So whats w/ the party tomorrow
me 3:43pm

??
me 3:43pm

[link to coordinates]
Rabbit 4:00pm

At first, I thought it was weird that Rabbit sent coordinates rather than an address, but after opening it, I realized there wasn’t an address to send. From what I could tell, the latitude and longitude were that of a bridge onto the freeway. It was a high bridge. My guess was the meeting place was under the bridge, though Street View didn’t have any good angles to help me figure out what to expect.

Thanks! Ill be there
me 4:03pm

looking forward to seeing you
Rabbit 5:28pm

oh! I almost forgot they dont let phones in, but i dont think thatll be a problem for you :P
Rabbit 5:52pm

lol no problem at all ;)
me 6:03pm

My last text to Rabbit marked my survival of another work week of repeated stupid questions, contradictory feedback, and petty power struggles.

Getting any sleep that night required chemical assistance.

——————

I went through my Saturday in a haze. I was in and out of sleep for hours. Even after two cups of coffee, I was still groggy. I at least leveraged my inability to choose an outfit to get through most of my laundry. Lunch was late, and dinner was skipped. With excitement, I noted the sky turning shades of peach and gold. The closer the night came, the more of myself I felt.

I remember little of the drive except skipping track after track. I turned the sound system off as I crossed the bridge at the coordinates Rabbit sent me. I knew it was a high bridge, but I was still shocked at just how high it was from the ground. Great concrete supports held the bridge at least a hundred feet from the warehouses below. I nearly got lost just trying to turn around at one of the exits.

During my second trip across the bridge, I slowed down. It looked like there were roads among the warehouses below, so there had to be a way to get to them. The first exit after the bridge was unmarked and unlit -I nearly missed it. Traffic was negligible, so no one of consequence caught me cutting a lane to squeeze onto the off-ramp. There was a noticeable change in the road’s maintenance. Newer soft gray clashed against aged black at the edge of the off-ramp. The potholes that had me jolting in my seat sat hidden in the shadows. Hardly any of the streetlights appeared to be in working condition. Spend enough time in a busy city, and you forget what it really means to not be around people. I’ve stumbled home at three in the morning with the occasional passing car and other wayward soul. I hadn’t felt this physically isolated in a long time.

I struggled to keep an eye on the road while trying to watch the bridge that loomed over the boarded-up block. The first right I took, I questioned the entire time if it was still part of the road or just some leftover patch of asphalt. The second right eased the tension from my shoulders. A bit up the road in what had once been a junkyard was a herd of vehicles ranging from the luxury to the beater. It looked just like the herd I found myself parking in at every other rave or festival.

Even all the way out here, raves attracted a mix of true believers and the opportunistic. In the lot, I found a parking space surprisingly close to the entrance.

Parked, I stuffed my phone and lodging keys into the center console. The only things I kept with me were my ID, a debit card, and my car key.
Standing outside my car, I noticed how quiet it was. There was no distant rumble of music or the grinding murmur of a crowd. There was just the occasional rolling whistle of vehicles on the bridge that was nearly overhead. Looking around, I found an unnatural hue of light thrown onto the bridge’s support, just over the top of a dark, brutalist industrial building.

I started toward the glimmering sheen. I again noticed the lack of other people. No one else was mingling around the cars or wandering toward the glow of neon proverbial fire.

It wasn’t till I was across the street and passed the shrouded building that my heart began to race. Each beat sped into the next. It was a rare spike of emotional insanity. The reality of the moment crashed upon me. I was alone in an unfamiliar place, far away from anywhere I knew.

It was exhilarating.

Before me was a gravel expanse that stretched from shipping containers arranged like a wall around a warehouse. A canvas party tent was nestled in the middle like a gate. The drawbridge was up, and the flaps of the tent shut. The glow of green and blue intensified, emitted from behind the wall and through the cracks of the entrance. A line had been here once. Serpentine marks in the gravel showed the paths people had shuffled as they filed into the event. Garbage was scattered all the way up to the entrance. Collections of beads, crumpled water bottles, ripped baggies -the usual signs of life I looked for at these events.

It was my turn to cross the no-man’s land. I trudged over the packed gravel that the vibrant world I expected to find beyond didn’t have time to claim.

The heavy and unwieldy fabric doors proved far more permeable than they had appeared from a distance.

The stagnant air of the city was washed off me by a breeze of cool air tinged with the alluringly sour scent of bodies, alcohol, and ill-chosen locations. The room was dark but small enough that I could generally make out the walls as charcoal silhouettes. Across the tent was the exit, no light helping shape the tent flaps. Lamps on the floor twisted and turned to paint cosmic-scapes across the angled ceiling. Off to the left, behind a rugged counter, were two women. “Hello!” Cheered Woman 1.

“Welcome,” Woman 2 said. Woman 1 wore their hair up, unlike Woman 2.

“Umm, hi. Am I late?” I ventured to question.

“Were you expected earlier?” Asked Woman 1.

I paused to think but eventually answered, “I don’t think I was.”

“Then you’re not late at all,” Woman 2 concludes. Woman 1 nods. I step toward them, pulling out my ID and card. 

“What’s the cost?”

Woman 1 tilts her head. Woman 2 arches a brow.

“The cover?” I asked as if to clarify.

“You came in through it,” Woman 1 remarks.

“There,” Woman 2 points at the fabric, still swaying in my wake.

“Can I just go in then?” I point at the other set of tent flaps. Both women laugh.

“Of course not,” Woman 1 says.

“How open are you this evening?” Woman 2 asks.

“I’m not,” I answer flatly out of instinct. I did not truly understand the question; even now, I’m not entirely sure, but I think I’ve pieced enough together.

The two hosts exchanged serious looks before reapplying their pleasant masks.

“Right hand, please,” Woman 1 says, digging for something out of my view. I did as requested and held out my hand. I felt the fabric wristband fitted over my fingers before I saw it. It was black with a white smiley face that had Xs for eyes. The wristband was cinched tight enough it couldn’t be removed without destroying it.

“Enjoy,” the two dismissed with little waves.

——————

Impulsively, a hand lifted to shield my eyes. I had stepped from the stereotypical dimly lit entrance into what seemed like a giant flashlight. The brilliance quickly faded. Before me was a rounded hallway, small light bulbs lining everywhere except the floor. The bulbs had been reduced to holding pale orange glows. It was still challenging to look at - not because of any single light, but because of just how many there were. Even with eyes narrowed and nose wrinkled, I couldn’t figure out how long the hall was or see what was at its end.

I took my first step forward, and the silence that followed was like putting my head in a bucket of water. The incessant hum of hundreds, if not thousands of bulbs cased. The circle of lights immediately around me remained on, illuminating only a foot or so in either direction. Even the passage back to the entrance was shielded by a wall of pitch.

Another experimental step forward.

The light followed, running into the next row of bulbs.

I leaned on my tiptoes.

The lights watched, wiser than my boundary-pushing.

I fell into my next two steps.

One row of bulbs sparked to life, followed by another, the light keeping pace.

I took a step back.

The lights dimmed, unamused.

Two steps forward.

The lights intensified again before moving with me.

Two steps back, and the lights flickered to their dullest shade of gold. They were about to go out. I did not want them to go out.
I hopped back to where I was, rocking on my heels to kill my momentum.

Excitedly, the lights jumped back up, and I could have sworn they almost moved forward, but they saw my trick.
Play continued much this way. I would leap and skip forward, slide back, tease a step I wouldn’t take. At each play I made, the lights were stalwart. They would lessen and brighten, move only when I dedicated myself to moving down the hall. They were admirable, if not frustrating, opponents. A thin wooden door had appeared ahead, much to my surprise. I heard a chuckle, which drew my attention to a broad, harmless smile. Above the smile, a set of sunglasses reflected my flushed face, haloed by spikes of dancing light.

“Hello again,” I greeted sunglasses, who initially only chuckled. I waited a socially acceptable amount of time before turning to abandon the conversation.

“Quite the game there,” Sunglasses finally commented. I was tempted to let them linger in reply but couldn’t help myself but to answer.

“Everything is a game if you just try.”

“Who makes the rules?”

“I do, usually.”

“A bit cheating, isn’t it?”

“No, others could make the rules if they were so clever.”

“Ahh, all fair then?”

“Naturally.” I puffed out my chest, wanting to seem more sure of my response than I actually was.

“What of the games you don’t master?”

“They’re unfair. The stakes were set without me.” Sunglasses nodded as if they understood.

“You intend to go in?” A jingling hand gestured at the door before me.

“I do, I’m looking for Rabbit. They invited me.”

“There are many rabbits in there,” Sunglasses said. They leaned closer, my reflection warping in the curved lenses.

“Not a rabbit, Rabbit.”

“Ahh.” Sunglasses chuckled. “They’re late as always then.”

“Am I late?”

“Are you?”

“I got here exactly when I expected,” I clarified.

“Doesn’t sound late to me.”

“Then I guess I’m not.”

“Then you are not. Careful though, little owl.”

I tilted my head to the side.

“There are many clever birds here tonight and many games whose rules you don’t control.”

“Noted,” I state with nothing but confidence. Sunglasses placed a large hand on the thin, battered door, and it creaked open. “Thank you,” I chimed to a knowing head nod. As I passed, I noted a purple bracelet with a smiley face that had Xs for eyes nestled among the far more elegant choices of wristwear.

——————

The door swung shut behind me, and I was plunged into darkness. The vibrant room had burned itself in my vision. The ground my feet were expecting failed to coalesce. And just as panic began to build in my chest, just as my heart skipped its first beat, my foot found the concrete. Sneaker squelched, the sound lost under the murmur of a crowd and the distant pull of music. I could hear the rattle of shelved glasses better than the melody, but I was excited. My heart made up for its skipped beat and began to race, only quickening as my eyes adapted to the dim, inverted illumination. I was in a concrete room but on the wrong side. I was on the ceiling.

Above me loomed giant pieces of repurposed wooden goods. Crates as chairs, spools as tables, concrete bricks with 2x4s converted into shelves. It was all above my head, just out of my reach; however, some of the distorted, shadowy figures in the crowd had to duck under various pieces. I blinked furiously, desperately wanting to see more. Slowly, shadows became faces, flushed and painted. None of them were the face I had hoped to see. I barely made out a bar peeking into the light cast by fixtures bulging out of the floor. The two barkeeps were the only figures that seemed to be gravitationally aligned with the furniture.

Bartender 1 looked a lot like Bartender 2, even beyond their usual similarities with attractive party staff. They had mirrored tattoos along the side of their hips. "Hey there!" the first greeted with the snake skeleton on their right hip.

"How are you," the second added with the exposed ribs of a serpent on their left hip. Even their voices were almost identical. They moved to stand at the edge of the bar that hung closest to me. My head and their heads had to cant back to watch each other.

"I'm looking for Rabbit," I announced.

"That's not a lot to go off of," Bartender 1 said.

"There's lots of little bunnies here tonight," Bartender 2 added.

"Not a bunny," I clarified firmly. "Rabbit."

"Could you mean?" Bartender 1 began moving to grab an empty glass placed on the counter.

"That kind of punk one?" Bartender 2 completed while performing a refill with a practiced, enticing smile.

"Yeah!" I couldn't honestly be sure, but my gut said they were right. Or maybe I just desperately wanted it to be that easy. I lowered my chin to keep eyes on Bartender 1, who was searching for a bottle among those rattling on the shelf behind them.

"I think they scampered through to the dance floor about two hours ago," Bartender 1 said. No, the skeleton was on their left hip; it had to be Bartender 2.

"Pretty late for them," Bartender 1 giggled. Snake, right hip, definitely Bartender 1.

"What's a bird like you want with them?" Bartender 2 asked, leaning back at the counter near me.

"Yeah, not many come after them," Bartender 1 chided, standing so their tattoo touched Bartender 2's.

"They invited me," I answered. Bartender 2, no 1, snake ribs on the right hip, raised her eyebrows.

"Oh? Well, if that isn't just unexpected."

"Why?" I could feel myself starting to scowl and tried to stop it.

"They don't invite people," actual Bartender 2 said.

"Are lots of people here invited?"

"Everyone," the two said in unison. They leaned forward so their weight rested on their elbows. My gaze dropped to follow the motion.

"Everyone?"

"No one gets in without an invite."

"How can you be so sure?"

They shrugged.

"You are at a bar," Bartender 1 commented pointedly. I arched a brow, lowering my nose to maintain eye contact.

"Usually, people at a bar get a drink." Actual Bartender 1 added.

"I'm okay," I waved, attempting to dismiss the sentiment.

"You don't want to break expectations, do you?" the Bartender with the snake on their left hip said. Bartender 1. No, 2. 1 had it on the right hip.

"I suppose there's no reason to," I admitted.

"So what'll it be?" Bartender 2 asked, leaning against the bar.

"Just water for now."

The right-hip tattooed bartender produced a water bottle with the label torn off. As she cracked it open, her mirror pulled out a blue shimmering vial. A few drops were added to the water bottle, and it was shaken calmly before being placed on the counter in front of me.

I took the drink and imbibed mouthful after mouthful. The water was subtly sweet. The sparkles popped on my teeth and against my tongue. I had to take a second to catch my breath as I returned the empty bottle to the two.

"What's in it," I asked.

"Nothing you wouldn't expect," Bartender 1 said with a comforting chuckle.

"We'd hate for someone to have a bad time," Bartender 2 added.

"How much?" They laughed at me.

"No need to worry about such things."

"Refreshing?" The right-hipped serpent questioned. I nodded my head.

"If you want to chase Rabbit," The left-hipped serpent began. I watched their eyes sweep off me and over my shoulder. My gaze chased after theirs to a distant doorway. It was more akin to the entry of some ancient holy site, the archway unmarked by any past attempts at baring or dooring the way. The blackness contained within its curve fluxed between bolts and flashes of sharp, radiant colors.

"They're probably in there," the direction finally concluded.

The bass grumbled like a hungry stomach. I navigated around the various makeshift seats and tables. As I drew closer, the air became warmer and wetter, like unsated breath. It smelled of bodies and sweat buried under the almost sting of manufactured fog. Thin gray clouds rolled along the concrete floor, starting to cling to my sneakers as I moved before the threshold. Deep in the darkness, figures swayed and bobbed through light-painted fog. The music was swelling. My trajectory was no longer under my own control. My feet were pulled forward by the dimly lit allure of bodies, noise, and neon.

——————

Melodic noise accelerated around the holy amen break, the most prolific of drum samples.

Bum . . Tss . . . Bum Tss . . Bum . . Tss . . . Bum Tss

The snare ever consistent, perfectly timed, sharp.

The kick syncopated, swinging, motivating.

The bass grabbed my rib cage and shook me from head to foot. Frantic melody jumped from synthetic instrument to synthetic instrument to find the perfect line between familiar and novel which each cycle. I couldn’t help but sprint and sway with the drumstep song I gloriously didn’t recognize.

The crowd was like a reef, life of so many shapes and colors caught in the push and pull of unseen tides. Large masses crammed together, small groups giggled and bounced, open spaces allowed the skilled to slide to and fro, and deep expanses had those armed with glowing toys produce elaborate light shows.

I could feel the temperature rising around me except around my ankles, where billowing fog kept it cool. The music kindled a fire in my stomach that spread first down my legs and to my feet. My left foot slid under my right before I swapped weight to my right heel and threw myself into a spin. I halted my momentum simply by returning my left foot to the ground and sliding it back without moving. I could shuffle pretty well back then.

I drifted among the dancers as the verse plowed through to the driving chorus. On the distant shore of the dance floor, I could see the hard shapes and twisting edges of lights that marked an elaborate but obfuscated DJ stand.

Deeper into the ebb and flow. Hands and arms slid over me like seaweed on a diver, gently coiling or touching only briefly before floating away. Even in my haze, I noticed the wristbands and their vast array of colors: orange, blue, magenta, pink, green, orchid, puce, seafoam, amber, and mauve - such a vibrant mixture. Above me was only inky black, disrupted by flickers of color that shimmered as if through heavy refraction. There was no sign of the ceiling one would expect to be held up by the thick concrete columns spread throughout the room.

The steady bass, through each rise and fall, buzzed against my head, encasing my skull in a comforting rumble. It was like drowning in a warm bath, cradling, consensual, and soothing.

My hips twisted, and my core tightened. My feet slipped against the ground, contradicting the actual direction of my momentum. I reveled in the evolution of the digital arrangement. Hi-hats would stutter into a switch of the beat that clashed with the bass and synths racing for attention.

I drifted there, thoughts floating between the attention on my body’s movements and the sensation of the music washing over me.

Feet crossed over each other.

The echoing percussion formed a frantic rhythm.

A heel dug into the ground to serve as a pivot for a spin.

Distorted synths swept up and down an augmented scale.

The dance floor roiled under a sudden slow groove.

Lights bubbled upward, popping somewhere in the dark above.

White bunnies hopped around feet.

The bunnies were attached to feet. It was Rabbit! Eyes darted up to catch flashes of light hair bobbing through the crowd.

I leaned forward and stretched my hand out to try and pull myself through the crowd. I was rebuffed and pushed further away from Rabbit. My mouth opened, but all I heard was an ominous note of the looming bass drop. The crowd calmed for a moment, at least physically. Tension rippled over every member, waiting for the monsoon of something heavy to follow the creeping blanket of noise. I knew this calm was not going to last.

I pushed forward and choked out apologies, nudging people apart with shoulder and arm, pulling myself through the subtly shifting mob.

The drone fell away; the shriek of a cymbal called for an end to the calm. My chest buzzed before I heard that first heavy note bend up before another bass rushed down in tone. The crowd screamed almost as loud. I was then pushed forward and bucked into a spiral, further into the mix. A wavering melody punctuated punches that ripped through the crowd. Fingers wrapped around my wrist that I instinctively wrenched free. One foot crossed in front of the other, and my momentum stopped by claws at my waist. I twisted this way and then that way before I was allowed to escape. I wanted out, but on all sides was flesh and fabric. The pungent smell of sweat and salt pricked my nostrils and filled my mouth with the hint of a taste I wanted to vomit away. I could feel the promise of a bruise set in on my shoulder as a hefty palm landed with intent.

The pressure dissipated almost all at once, the hand leaving my shoulder with a spiteful lack of grace. Where once had been twisting human-esque figures was Rabbit. Rabbit's lips moved, and they gestured in a direction away from the heart of the squall. All I needed to do was nod. They collected my hand like a dropped flower, confident but careful not to damage it. In their trail, the crowd drifted around me harmlessly till they were pulling me through a thin doorway that glowed orange.

——————

As the last of me passed into the orange glow, Rabbit let me go. Their hand still held my attention. Around their wrist was a white fabric bracelet sinched tight. There was a smiley face on the bracelet stitched in black with Xs for eyes and a straight line for a mouth.

The space was warm and dry. The aroma of bodies in exertion was replaced with smoke. We were in a courtyard. A steel wall behind us and to the right. The other walls were brick in the midst of a losing battle with ivy. Dented and rusted fire pits dotted the space. Chairs and benches of concrete and plywood were placed near the source of the flickering orange glow. 

"Hello?" I heard questioned.

"Oh, hi," I said as I returned from my trip into the light-polluted atmosphere. Rabbit chuckled, and so did I.

"I'm really glad you made it."

"Me too, it's been so real," I said, brain momentarily filtering out the moments I was almost pulled under.

"Want to sit? Looks like you need it," Rabbit said as they gestured to a firepit. A few people passed us back into the call of the rave.

"That sounds nice," I replied. Up close, the crackle of the fire turned the grumble of the rave into white noise. Red-gold tongues danced atop crumbling charred wood.

"How are you liking it so far?" Rabbit asked.

"I'm loving it," I assured them.

"That's great. I wasn't sure I'd run into you; it's always so busy." Rabbit laughed.

"I was having fun but had an eye out for you," I said.

"Really?" Rabbit seemed genuinely surprised. I smiled warmly and nodded. Perhaps they were simply unaccustomed to being chased.

A metal screech sent shivers up my spine. Rabbit sat straight, eyes wide, what little color had started to bloom on their cheeks withering away. I glanced around, trying to find the source, searching for the comfort understanding brought.

Out here among the fires, Rabbit and I were alone.

Rabbit leaned close, commanding my attention. "No questions." Rabbit said, holding up a single finger. I began to mutter a request for clarification when they held up a second finger. "Call and response."

A group burst into the courtyard from an archway in the middle of the far brick wall. They wore baggy clothes and chunky shoes, a far cry from the slim, almost non-existent clothing of most ravers. Each of them wore a mask that covered the lower half of their face. For some, the accessory was a medical mask; for others, it was a mass-produced muzzle made to resemble a gas mask. The largest of them wore a highly stylized snarling maw with large teeth accentuated by tusks.

Their wristbands were orange.

The largest, with intensely dark eyes, gestured at me and my companion. The group, silently carousing, swarmed around us. There was a 'clunk' as a machete was tossed into the fire.

By our shoulders, Rabbit and I were forced to straddle over the bench facing each other. The largest of the group reached into the space between us, flicking open a butterfly knife. The open weapon was placed between us and spun.

Wooss -the knife whistled.

The fire crackled.

Wooosss -the knife yawned, starting to slow.

Hands smacked in celebration.

Wosssss -the knife exhaled before coming to a stop with the point perfectly pointed at me.

All eyes fell on me. I could feel my mouth drop open despite the utter blank of confusion in my head. I wanted answers, but Rabbit had said 'no questions.'

"Hello," I tried, but an immediate chorus of choked cackles followed. The towering one flicked two fingers at one of the others, who took a pocket knife from their belt and used it to pull a small blackened chunk of wood from the fire.

I glanced at Rabbit; their lips pressed into a thin line, and genuine pain was in their eyes. I looked back at the masked figure by the fire too late. They grabbed my wrist and dropped the smoldering detritus on my arm. It inhaled sharply through my teeth, arm twisting instinctively to repel the burning coal. It hurt, but I had burnt myself worse on the laundry drier. The skin at the point of contact was pink, but it would fade in a few hours.
The towering figure held up a finger and then held their hand out toward me. I was still expected to play a part I didn't understand. My tongue felt like cotton in my mouth; it was scratchy and taking up too much space.

"Run," I said, hoping Rabbit would understand I was making a suggestion. I glanced sidelong at Tower, who turned his cold gaze to Rabbit. When I looked back at Rabbit, their bright eyes met mine.

"I ran track for a few weeks in middle school. I was fine enough at it, but it demanded more of an investment than I could reliably fulfill, so like a lot of things, I just stopped before I ever had to really try." When nothing but silence immediately followed, Rabbit looked to Tower, and I did the same.
Tower nodded.

I looked back at Rabbit with the excitement that always overtakes relief. Rabbit remained composed. "Dance," he said plainly. All eyes were upon me again. Rabbit had given me the blueprint.

"I've danced my whole life. It took ten years of begging for my parents to let me take ballet. I still do group workshops sometimes." My attention flitted between Rabbit and Tower. Their assessment of my response was delayed, but Tower eventually gave a reluctant nod.

"Fire," I said to Rabbit.

Rabbit swallowed before responding. "I've never been burnt," they stated. They didn't seem to take their eyes off me, but I swear I saw them flinch as Tower shook their head.

Tower held three fingers up to one of the crowd who clambered over themselves and tattered pant hems to get to the firepit near us. With the machete, they pulled out a burning red chunk of wood, occasional lashes of flame emerging like dying gasps. The perpetrator had help as others held Rabbit's hand out, palm up. I gasped instinctively, watching the coal scraped onto Rabbit's hand. Rabbit's arm shook and quivered, but the masks kept their arm steady. Rabbit clenched their teeth. The smell of smoke intensified, and I could hear skin burning. It was only a second, maybe two before the masks released Rabbit. The small, smoldering chunk would skitter away to hide under another bench, where it cooled to harmlessness. The blunt weapon was tossed back into the fire with a hefty clang.

Out of instinct, I leaned forward to get closer, but Rabbit shot me a look that felt like a chain had been wound around my chest. Weight shifted from chest to stomach. Rabbit cradled their hand while they sat up straight and took a deep breath.

"I've been burnt twice. The first was when my dad encouraged me to touch the grill to win a bet with a friend. The second was tonight." Despite their posture and confidence, I saw hurt in Rabbit. I released a breath I didn't realize I was holding when Tower nodded approval. "Water," Rabbit returned, and the weight in my gut twisted. I saw Rabbit's eyes widen; dread must have been clear on my face.

"I've almost drowned three times," I started truthfully enough. There was a pause, and I could swear Tower's cold eyes could see straight through to the void forming in the pit of my gut, turning into a black hole that pulled my heart from my chest. "The first was as a child -I don't remember it. I was left unattended near a lake. The second was from falling off a boat, too wasted to save myself. The third was just a mistake."

I didn't see Tower shake his head, but I heard the sudden burst of motions around us. I opened my mouth to protest, but Rabbit shook their head frantically. The masks pulled my arm far enough out it tilted my posture. I gritted my teeth, having seen enough to understand this was going to be awful. Knowing did nothing to assuage the panic that had me trying to twist and pull away as the machete was removed from the fire. The dark steel had turned orange.

I can barely remember the moment the side of that searing instrument was touched to my forearm. It was the type of white intensity that washes away the world. The damage was so great that for a moment, I didn't feel it, but my brain knew it was there. The dread of the sensation I knew was coming loomed tall in my mind. Then it hit. The flash of burning pain radiated over my arm and through my shoulder blades.

The stench of burning living meat was disgusting. I could hear my skin snapping like frayed fabric over my labored breathing and sharp muttering cries.
