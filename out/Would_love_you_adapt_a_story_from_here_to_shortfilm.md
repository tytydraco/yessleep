I am a former film students and a budding film maker. 

Any writers here would be interested in seeing their stories turned into short films? I dont think its the first time someone wanted to make a film or short film from stories of r/nosleep. 

Some of the stories here are really incredible and I'm interested in adapt one or two for my demo reel and portfolio. I would ofcourse ask the writers for permission. 

This is an idea l've been thinking around in my head for some time. 
Though the butchers fit the film sare little to none the films would be professionally shot with professional actors. 
Stories would be adapted, with the author's permission, for a more visual medium.

I would love to know some suggestions of your favourite stories here that you would love to see in film or short film.

I did see there were a post from free years ago where some one was interested in making these stories into movies. Couldn’t dig deep enough to know if someone did. If any of the stories from here are made in to a Shrtfilms or film or series please let me know if that too.
