**Rule 4: ANGELS are no faster than their human hosts, but can completely disable any feelings of tiredness**

Ricketts looked us over before giving a single nod. “Let me collect my things.”

“I’m not sure we have time,” the administrator responded. 

Ricketts started to swing the door shut before seeming to pause to consider the administrator’s response. “I can fix the outbreak.” He shut the door as the administrator tried to pound a response in vain.

"You have five minutes!" the administrator shouted at the door, then turned back toward the jeep, shaking his head.

“Do you think all the infected are,” I paused, unsure what the most humane way of asking if they were dead, “taken care of?”

The administrator looked at me apprehensively. "I hope so." He glanced toward where the prison had been. "Either way, we can't go back. We're going to the control lab, see if Ricketts has any ideas, and once we get confirmation that everything is contained..." His eyes darted toward Ricketts's temporary cottage. He dropped his voice. "The board is gonna want to tie up loose ends."

Sebastian sighed before pulling out a cigarette. He took a drag before my outstretched hand was able to convince him to give me a puff. 

It felt smooth; the first thing I was able to control that night. As I handed back the cigarette, my finger lingered a bit on Sebastian’s, both of us newly minted alumni of the worst nightmare we’d live through. His eyes met mine, both pairs intertwined in an undefinable understanding when the shot tore through the night. 

Sebastian cried out in pain, dropping the still-lit cigarette and clutching his left shoulder, blood beginning to seep from a new wound. Another shot whizzed above my ear when I felt the administrator grab me and a still howling Sebastian and pull us to the backside of the jeep.

“He’s gone fucking mad!” the administrator screamed as he pressed his hand down on Sebastian’s wound. Aguero had climbed over to the passenger seat and tumbled out of the jeep to the grass, quickly regaining his balance, first aid kit in hand. 

“Who? What?” My confusion became all-consuming. The administrator pointed towards the house. 

“It’s Ricketts. He’s shooting at us!” As if on cue, a bullet slammed against the other side of the jeep, one of the windows shattering. “WE’RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU! WE NEED YOUR HELP!” The administrator hollered.

A pause. Then Ricketts's voice, strained and desperate, carried through the shattered window. "I'm close! I'm so close to fixing this! Don't kill me, please, I can cure them!"

The administrator's grip on Sebastian's shoulder tightened. He looked at me, his eyes hard. "We need him alive, Sofia. Whatever it takes."

I nodded, my heart hammering against my ribs.

"Aguero," the administrator grunted, "you stay here with Sebastian. Keep pressure on that wound. Sofia and I are going in."

Aguero's hands were already digging through the first aid kit, pulling out gauze. Sebastian's face had gone pale, his breathing shallow, but he managed a weak nod in my direction.

The administrator moved first, keeping low as he circled toward the front of the house. I went the opposite direction, my unfamiliar gun heavy in my sweating palms as I crept along the side of the cottage. The windows here were dark, curtains drawn. I could hear Ricketts inside: footsteps, the scrape of furniture being moved, frantic muttering.

The back door was slightly ajar.

I eased it open, wincing at every creak. The smell hit me first. It was the same copper-and-rot stench from the facility, but stronger and more concentrated. My stomach lurched as I stepped inside.

The kitchen had been converted into a makeshift laboratory. Every available surface was covered in beakers, syringes, and notebooks filled with dense chemical formulas. But it was the cages that made me freeze.

There were at least a dozen of them, stacked against the far wall. Rats, rabbits, and what looked like a small dog. All dead. Their bodies twisted in unnatural positions, black goo dried around their mouths and matted in their fur. Some of the cages had been left open, the animal corpses partially dissected, organs exposed and labeled with tiny flags. On the counter, a dead rat lay pinned to a metal tray, its chest cavity splayed open, black residue coating its internal organs like oil.

"Jesus Christ," I whispered.

A crash from the front room snapped me back. I moved through the kitchen into what must have been a living room, now buried under stacks of textbooks and research journals. A whiteboard dominated one wall, covered in equations I couldn't begin to understand.

"Ricketts!" The administrator's voice boomed from the front door. "Come out now! We're not here to hurt you!"

"Stay back!" Ricketts's voice came from down a narrow hallway. "You don't understand—if I can just isolate the degradation sequence—"

I moved toward the hallway, gun raised. The administrator was already there, blocking the front entrance. Our eyes met. He gestured: you take left, I'll take right.

We advanced down the hallway together. Two doors—one open, revealing a bathroom. One closed.

The administrator kicked it open.

Ricketts stood in what must have been a bedroom converted into a workspace. Filing cabinets lined the walls, a desk covered in more research notes, and several mason jars filled with samples of that black substance in varying states of decay: some still viscous, others dried to a crust.

Ricketts held a syringe in one trembling hand, filled with something clear. His other hand held a small pistol, pointed shakily between the administrator and me.

"I can fix this," Ricketts said, his voice cracking. "The rats were producing the substance wrong; their bodies couldn't sustain the conversion, but with humans, I thought I'd solved it. I thought—" His voice broke. "An outbreak, right?"

“How did you know?” I demanded, jamming my gun closer to Ricketts.

"Lower the gun, doctor," the administrator said calmly, his own weapon trained on Ricketts's chest.

"Tell me what happened first!" Ricketts demanded. "O'Bryon was stable. The treatment worked. I saw it work!"

I started to answer when the administrator shot me a look, telling me he would handle the negotiation. I figured if worst comes to worst, we could just bum-rush the mad scientist and hog-tie him hostage. But the administrator seemed to be trying to get the doctor to agree to come. 

His moral plea went unheeded. His contractual obligation fell on deaf ears. It was only when the administrator shifted the conversation to Ricketts's own self-preservation that we started to make headway.

"You and me, we're both dead men walking," Ricketts continued, his voice dropping. "The moment they have what they need from us, we're liabilities. You know that."

The administrator's weapon wavered slightly.

"So here's what's going to happen," Ricketts said, his voice steadying. "You two are going to help keep me alive long enough to actually fix this. And in return, I'm going to help keep *you* alive." He looked directly at the administrator. "I have documentation. Everything about the ANGEL program—the board approvals, the funding sources, the trial results they told me to adjust. If anything happens to me, it all goes public."

"You're blackmailing us?" I said incredulously.

"I'm offering mutual survival," Ricketts corrected. He slowly lowered his pistol.

The administrator stared at him for a long moment. Then, slowly, he lowered his weapon.

"If you're lying to me—"

"I'm not," Ricketts interrupted. "I want to live just as much as you do. And I actually *can* fix this, but I need access to the main lab, the full research database, and both of you watching my back."

The sound of a car horn blaring cut through the tension.

The three of us froze. The administrator's face went white.

"No," he breathed.

We ran.

Aguero was standing in the jeep's driver seat, one hand pressed on the horn, the other pointing frantically down the gravel road.

At first, I couldn't see them in the darkness. Then the porch light caught them.

Figures. Moving in formation down the road. At this distance, they looked almost normal. As they drew closer, I could see it: the too-perfect synchronization of their steps, the way they moved as one organism rather than individuals.

And they were fast, closing the distance between us with every second.

Orange jumpsuits. Inmates.

They had gotten out.

And now they had found us.

The administrator grabbed Ricketts by the arm, yanking him toward the jeep. "Move! Everyone in the vehicle, now!"

As we stumbled out the door and piled into the jeep, I could hear the low rhythmic humming and song of the infected moving closer. Sebastian was barely conscious in the back seat, Ricketts clutching his research notes like a lifeline. The engine roared to life just as the first of them stepped into the circle of porch light, still smiling.
