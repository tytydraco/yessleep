It was a still, cold night in January — to be exact, Monday, January 20th, 2025. I was house-sitting. It was an older home, not ancient by any means, but old; one of those ranch houses that rested in the fields on the outskirts of a small rural town. The house sat at the end of a long dirt road, enclosed by miles of fields. It was a peaceful place — no streetlights, no cars, only stars and the quiet electrical hum of the porch light.

My job was simple: there were six dogs — seven if you included mine — and a pen with some horses on the far side of the yard. I had to feed and water them, of course, and also make sure the dogs stayed out of neighboring properties. They were free-range, and with so many fields to explore, they were living the best life a dog could live. But when dusk came, I had to round them up. Across the yard from the house stood an old wooden barn, and in that barn was a cattle trailer full of straw — that was where the dogs were to be locked up for the night. It sounded simple enough, but with seven dogs on a property of who knows how many acres, it wasn’t the easiest task.

I had just finished my dinner when I decided I’d better look for them. I’d been scrolling on my phone for some time, and when my attention finally left the screen, the house was much darker than I realized. I put on my boots, opened the screen door, and headed out into the cold evening air. The sun had just set and was shedding the last of its light on the nearby mountaintops. The tallest peak glowed pink and orange along with the clouds above. It looked beautiful — piercing the sky across the endless sea of farmland. To tell the truth, I was staring off at the scene for some time before the silence was broken by a distant howl.

With one howl came another, and soon a whole pack of coyotes filled the air with their mournful cries. I knew then I’d best get those dogs. It didn’t take much calling before rounding up most of them. My dog answered my calls first, running enthusiastically across the yard, then another, and another. Soon I had all but Lewis. That’s when I heard — across the field behind the barn — distant howls turn to growls, and then the growls became shrieks. With fingers crossed, praying that it was a coyote dying and not Lewis, I hopped into my truck. Quickly I swung open the old metal gate behind the barn and headed down the ditch bank. By that time, the sky’s light had faded, and all that could be seen was the two square feet of ground my headlights kept lit. I was beginning to feel a little spooked. As I looked the best I could at what little I could see, I listened for more howls. I couldn’t hear much more than the squeaky timing belt. After a few more minutes of driving and calling out “Lewis!”, I headed back to the house feeling defeated.

If that dumb dog died on my watch, it wouldn’t be long before I’d have lost that job — let alone get paid. But against all odds, the stupid mutt was sitting by the barn door, innocently wagging his tail when I pulled the truck back in the yard. Relieved, I opened the door and threw him in the cattle trailer. Then, in the dull light of my flashlight, I counted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven — and then again to ensure I had done my job. They were all there, squinting up at my light with curious eyes. I locked the trailer door, went out of the barn, and headed across the yard for the house. It was getting late by then, and I was ready to call it a day, so I took off my boots and shirt and jumped in bed. Little did I know, the night was not over.

After a few minutes of doomscrolling, I decided I’d better set my alarm and call it a day. I checked the time as I placed my phone down for the night — 10:47 PM. Not bad compared to the last few nights. I’d get a good seven hours of sleep, or so I thought. I had just begun to drift off when I heard it again — a distant howl pierced the silence, followed by another, and soon all the dogs in the trailer joined in the choir of dimwit K9s. Annoyed, I began to wonder if I had really gotten all the dogs rounded up. I did count them twice, so they must all be there. But did I close the gate behind the barn? I couldn’t remember — I had to go make sure. Reluctantly, I got back out of bed, put on my coat and boots, and headed out the door.

They had stopped their howling when I stepped outside. It was only the porch light’s lonely electric hum that accompanied the sound of my footsteps. With heavy eyelids, I walked toward the barn when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head to see a man on the far side of the yard, walking the opposite direction of me. Startled, I stopped and turned my attention to him. In an almost mirror-like fashion, he did the same. As my eyes focused on him, I realized he wasn’t just some random guy — he was me. Confused, I took a step toward the barn. At the same time, he took a step toward the house. I was so startled I woke up in a cold sweat. Guess I had gotten some sleep after all — sleep with some acid-trip dreams.

It took me a minute to settle down again, but after scrolling on Instagram for some time, I began to feel tired, and so I went back to sleep. It wasn’t until what felt like a couple of hours later that I woke up again to the irritating howls of the coyotes and cattle dogs. “What is their problem? Why at five in the morning?” I thought to myself in anger. I grabbed my phone to check the time, and after reading it once, I had to turn it off and check again.

It read 10:47 PM.

Just then, I heard another sound join in with the now haunting howls — a low metal creak, a distinct creaking I remembered well. The sound of the big metal gate opening behind the barn.
