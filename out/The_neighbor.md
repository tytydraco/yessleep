We were just kids playing basketball in the cracked alley behind our apartment complex. Me, my older brother Ray, Jasmine, and Joel. We were best pals and we rarely spent time apart. 

Every afternoon after school we were out there, being our usual dorky selves.

Everyone called us losers and weirdos for liking comic cons and cosplaying, but together nothing else mattered. 

If being cool meant acting bland, boring and judgmental like everyone else in school, then we would rather stay weird. In a cold world like this, it felt good to find people who liked you for being yourself.

The city had already put a curfew in place. Too many kids gone missing.

 Too many fliers taped to light poles. But as long as we stayed in the alley where the parents could see us, nobody yelled.

And always, she was there.

The woman in Apartment 3B.

She never came out. Or at least, I never saw her outside.

 Her place looked like a hoarder’s cave. If you squinted through her living room window you could see clutter stacked behind her like a crooked wall.

Most days she just watched. Hidden behind those faded floral curtains.

 You would not notice her at first, not until your eyes adjusted and the narrow gap in the fabric revealed the pale sliver of her face.

“She is probably just lonely,” Jasmine said once.

“She is a witch,” Ray said. “I swear I heard her arguing with her fridge.”

We laughed, but whenever I turned to take a shot and found her staring down at us, my stomach dropped like I had missed a step.

Everything changed one Thursday.

I came home late, just a few minutes before curfew. Great. I really hoped there was no patrol car nearby. I rounded the corner to our building and froze.

Flashing lights washed the walls in red and blue.

Two cruisers.

Aww crap, I was down on my luck, I tried to think of an excuse on the spot if they would question me.. but they weren’t noticing me at all..




I looked around and Officers were expecting the trunk of an unmarked car.

And then I saw her.

The woman from 3B, handcuffed and pushed into the back of a cruiser.

She sat completely still. Her eyes had no tears, no remorse for whatever she got arrested for..

She was not watching the officers. She was not looking at the ground.

She stared straight ahead.

Until she saw me.

Her head moved slowly. Our eyes locked.

Her face did not change at all. No fear, no confusion, no shame. Just that flat, glassy stare that made me feel like she was memorizing my face.

I gasped, like her glare froze me on the spot, Her eyes grew lightly but never turned away even when the cop car started moving.

I backed away slowly.. forcing my legs to move and I hurried home.

The cruiser rolled forward a moment later and she disappeared behind the lights.

I closed the door behind me and I screamed when I felt a shadow..

It was Ray pointing at the clock, “ Dude where have you been? you were almost too late “ He scolded..

“Sorry.. It’s just that.. the weird lady I saw her getting arrested” I stuttered.

Ray eyed me and moved towards the door locking it.

The next day her stare was still burned behind my eyes. I listened from the hallway while Ray watched the news.

A neighbor had taken the interview.

Mrs. Spillthebeans said she saw the woman drop something on the sidewalk while juggling her groceries. Something tiny.

A small shoe.

Blue, with a little rocket ship on the side.

It belonged to one of the missing kids from the next block. The police searched her apartment after that.

The reporter’s tone reveals her disgust despite remaining collected and professional.

They found remains. Bone fragments. Something wrapped and stored like food. A jar filled with teeth. 

And according to the detective, index cards with children’s names and dates written on them.’ The reporter said.

Joel barely spoke after hearing the news.

We still played ball often, but only when adults stayed close.

Whenever the curtains in 3B fluttered from a passing breeze, every one of us froze.

The apartment has been empty ever since.

Or at least, that is what everyone keeps saying.

But sometimes, when I walk with my puppy before dark, I catch myself looking up at that window. 

It is just a habit by now, something my nerves do before my brain decides anything.

And sometimes, only for an instant, I am sure I see someone shift behind the curtain.

For that moment I feel her eyes again. Watching every move I make.

I even called the police department last month, begging them never to let her move back here. I told them about the night she was arrested. How she turned her head toward me, as if it was a silent vow she might come for me next..
