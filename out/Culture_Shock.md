The first time Susannah's saliva dripped into my morning coffee, I didn't notice. I was too busy admiring the way the Filipino sunrise painted the mountains in shades of purple and gold, too distracted by how beautiful she looked preparing breakfast on the veranda of her family's colonial home. When she kissed me on the cheek and watched me drink, her amber eyes seemed to glow with an intensity I attributed to love.

I should have known something was wrong weeks before, when she first invited me to meet her family in the Philippines. Two years of long-distance dating, and she'd only ever agreed to video chat at dawn or dusk, Manila time. The nightmares started immediately after I booked my flight – vivid dreams of flesh tearing like wet paper, of wings unfurling from human backs, of hearts still beating in open air. I blamed travel anxiety, even when I woke up tasting copper.

The village outside Quezon City was exactly as she'd described it – lush, humid, with houses nestled between banana trees and birds of paradise. What she hadn't mentioned was the emptiness. No children playing in the streets, no neighbors chatting across fences. Even the stray dogs kept their distance from the family home, though I swore I could hear them howling at night, their cries cutting off abruptly mid-wail.

Her mother, Elena, greeted me with an embrace that made my skin prickle. She held me too long, her nose tracing a line from my collar to my ear, inhaling deeply. I felt like a wine being sampled, assessed for its bouquet.

"Welcome, James," she said, her accent thick but her English perfect. "We've heard so much about you." Behind her stood Susannah's grandmother and two aunts, all of them tall and elegant like my girlfriend, with the same high cheekbones and unusual amber eyes. They watched me with an intensity that made my skin crawl, like cats tracking a wounded bird. Later, I would understand they were watching to see if the change had begun.

Those first few days, I noticed my sense of smell growing sharper. Every morning and evening, they prepared elaborate meals – always insisting on serving me themselves, always watching me eat with those predatory smiles. The meat had a strange, gamey flavor I couldn't place, and sometimes I could swear it was still warm, as if it had been alive moments before reaching my plate. Each bite made me feel stranger, more alert, more... hungry.

My gums started to ache. My back itched constantly, especially at night. When I looked in the mirror, my own eyes seemed different – darker, with flecks of amber starting to bloom in the irises. I blamed it on jet lag, on the unfamiliar food, on anything but what it really was.

The house itself seemed alive at night. The locked cellar door that no one would discuss. The way the local villagers crossed themselves when we passed by. The strange, coppery smell that permeated the halls after sunset, like old pennies or fresh blood. And the sounds – God, the sounds. Wet, slithering noises in the walls, scratching above the ceiling, and sometimes, what sounded like distant screaming. My new heightened senses made it all unbearable.

It was on the fifth night that my own transformation began. I was following Susannah, my curiosity finally overwhelming my growing dread. The moon was full, casting everything in a sickly white light. From my window, I watched her walk into the banana grove behind the house, her white nightgown ghostly against the dark foliage. She stopped in a clearing and began to twitch.

The sight should have horrified me. Instead, I felt a deep resonance, as if my own body was remembering something ancient and terrible. I watched, transfixed, as a wet, tearing sound split the night – like someone ripping apart raw chicken. Susannah's torso separated from her waist, intestines dangling like obscene ribbons, glistening in the moonlight. Wings erupted from her back in a spray of dark fluid, unfurling like some hellish butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. When she turned, her face was no longer human. Her jaw had distended, filled with rows of needle-sharp teeth, and her eyes glowed like hot coals in a dead fire.

My own spine cracked audibly as I watched. The itching in my back had become unbearable, and I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pressing outward. I stumbled backward, knocking over a vase, and the crash brought instant silence, then the sound of wings.

Susannah floated through my window, her intestines swaying gently like seaweed in a current. Behind her, three more figures rose into view – her mother, grandmother, and aunt, all in the same horrific state of bifurcation. Their lower halves stood like empty clothes in the clearing, while their torsos floated on massive, leathery wings. The air filled with that chittering laughter I'd been hearing in my dreams – the same sound that had been building in my own throat.

"The change is already starting," she said, her voice a raspy version of its usual melody. "We've been feeding you our essence for days. In our saliva, in our food, in every kiss. We're mananangal, aswang, the hungry ones. It runs in the family, passed from mother to daughter... and sometimes, to those we choose to keep."

Through the window, I could see her family members floating in the yard, their eyes burning in the darkness. Elena called out, "The final transformation must be shared through a ritual as old as these islands. Not all survive it, of course, but Susannah thinks you're strong enough. The fact that you're still alive after drinking our essence proves it."

"I don't want to lose you," Susannah whispered, her inhuman face inches from mine. "And I don't want to have to kill you. Please don't make me choose. You're already halfway there – can't you feel it?"

I could. My teeth were lengthening, pushing outward. The skin along my spine was splitting, and I could feel something wet and membranous trying to spread. I looked at her clawed hand, then at her face – that strange mixture of the woman I loved and something ancient and horrifying. Two years of love and trust warred with primal terror. But then I remembered all the little things that now made sense: her strange hours, her intense protectiveness, the way she always seemed to know when danger was near. The way small animals disappeared whenever she visited me in the States.

Something moved in the cellar window – a pale face pressed against the glass, mouth open in a silent scream. I thought of the missing villagers, the strange meat at dinner, the screams in the night. Yet even that knowledge didn't repulse me anymore. Instead, I felt a new hunger stirring.

"What happens now?" I asked, my voice changing even as I spoke, becoming something inhuman.

She smiled, revealing rows of teeth that went far too far back into her head. "Now we complete what we started. The ritual requires... preparation. And I'm sure you must be very hungry by now."

As she led me outside to her waiting family, my skin began to split along my waist. Had I made a terrible mistake? Or was I about to become something magnificent and terrible? Either way, as Susannah's family circled above me like vultures, their wings blotting out the stars, I realized it was far too late to change my mind.

In the distance, a rooster crowed, but dawn seemed impossibly far away. Susannah's grandmother descended, carrying something that writhed in her clawed hands. The smell of fresh meat made my new teeth ache with anticipation.

"Let's begin," she said, her voice thick with hunger. "And remember, dear James – try to scream quietly. We wouldn't want to wake the neighbors. Though soon enough, you'll be the one doing the hunting."

As they closed in around me, their shadows merging into one, I couldn't tell if the pounding I heard was my heart or drums from the village – a death knell or a celebration. Perhaps both. Susannah's eyes met mine, filled with equal parts love and predatory anticipation, and I realized that sometimes love means not just accepting all parts of someone, but becoming something entirely new yourself.

The transformation was already burning through my body like acid in my veins. Whether this rebirth would be my salvation or destruction remained to be seen. But as my spine began to split and wings pushed through my shoulders, I found myself smiling with teeth that were no longer my own.
