I make cold eye contact with Blaine.

“Manny-” I begin, but the man continues.

“He grew angry”, Manny mutters, turning page after page, scanning them as quickly as he can. “Hans. He grows impatient, and becomes guilty because of this impatience. He is frustrated… anxious… Yes, here he notes his fear. He expresses true worry for the first time. Worry that they will not return for him before his supplies are exhausted”.

Manny’s eyes dart from left to right across the pages.

We watch him do so.

I find that my heart has begun to pound, and eventually Manny turns to the final entry.

Manny regards us, one by one, then reads the passage aloud.

*“‘I resent what I have done’*”, Manny reads. “*’And I now question if I have been made a fool, and if my superiors were either unable, or unwilling, to return. It matters not which is the truth, for they demonstrate the same ends. And besides, it is too late. This is likely to be my last entry.*

*What could have happened? If, as promised, my life was destined to be a part of something truly greater, then I would not have been left behind like this, and forgotten…*

*…I have given everything to the cause, and now, the end approaches. I will not be granted a passage to the truth. Maybe I deserve this fate.*

*I once considered Die Eintausend to be animals. Perhaps they still are. Vermin, and of a lower standing than myself… but even if this were true, to do what we have done, even to animals… No animal deserves such torment. Surely. Human or otherwise.*

*I cannot shut the project down. Even though it might force my comrades return. I do not know what they face, I cannot betray them. Not now. I have come too far. And so, as this is the path I have chosen, I don’t doubt I will be made accountable for my crimes.*

*If not in this life ,then the next.*

*To shut the project down will be to admit that it was all for nothing And I cannot do this. I must do what I believe to be right*”.

…

Manny finishes reading aloud, then closes the journal with a dull thud, placing it back on the desk.

&#x200B;

“Die Eintausend…” Kim repeats, out loud. “What could it be?”

“I have a theory, or two-” Manny begins, but he is again interrupted. Szymon leans around the open doorway, his expression dark.

“No need, Manny”, he says. “I believe that I have found it”.

He disappears, and hurriedly we follow on, leaving the control room behind and catching Szymon up as he passes through the second door, the one marked with the Black Sun.

&#x200B;

We step into an enormous room, shrouded in flickering green and watery light.

&#x200B;

Szymon strides to the room’s middle, and his shadow is thrown out long behind him across the floor.

“Oh…” Kim murmurs, her breathing growing shallower and shallower beside me, “oh no, oh no…”

&#x200B;

My eyes widen and I take a step forwards, caught in the clutches of terror.

&#x200B;

Blaine swears and Rudy does likewise, running across the room to catch up with Szymon.

Despite the cold, Manny is now sweating profusely, and I can see him shaking in the corner of my field of vision.

But each and every one of us stares at the towering centrepiece of the hall.

&#x200B;

This is no statue.

&#x200B;

We stare at a monstrous, translucent *box* of thick glass, refracting its green inner-light across our faces, across the walls, bizarre and ever-shifting shapes and shards.

It bubbles softly. It whirrs, and pipes overhead creak wearily in the darkness.

It is a tank, of sorts. Filled to the brim with an unknown green liquid, and inside… drifting like wraiths, as if caught in the wind… are hundreds and hundreds of *bodies*.

They are naked.

Warped.

Their eyes are all completely blank. Shimmering green, through the liquid, through the light, their mouths hung open and fixed with expressions of shock, or of silent horror, perhaps.

Bubbles form across their skin. Many of the drifters have developed tendrils, or frills that float behind them like the arms of a jellyfish.

I look at the faces behind the glass.

It is difficult to make them all out, but I get the strong impression that some are old, and some are young. Some are male, and some female.

These are people from all walks of life, and here they are. Drifting in the shimmering green light of the tank, way down here with us- beneath the waves.

&#x200B;

“*Die Eintausend*”, Manny whispers.

&#x200B;

The tank thrums and whirrs. The bodies within drift aimlessly across and around in the fractal green light of the water.

Although- it won’t be water, of course. It’ll be something else. Some other substance.

I step closer to the glass, my heart hammering. I’ve never seen anything like this before, of course. None of us have.

I peer into the tank, I study as best I can the faces of the corpses within.

&#x200B;

…Or, *are* they…? *Corpses*?

I squint.

They make me feel ill. The distortion of the glass and the light and the liquid makes it difficult to tell if the people inside are ‘breathing’, but, they certainly don’t appear alive in the ‘traditional’ sense.

Their expressions are fixed in place. Dark veins have crept up their host’s necks and have begun to streak across their faces.

Whenever I think I can see a twitch in a muscle, or in one of these mutated veins, I am met with a doubt that it was, perhaps, nothing more than trickery in the light.

Watching them all drift by… it makes my head spin. I release a breath I’d forgotten I was holding, and retreat with a hand on my forehead.

“This is it, right?” Rudy says, turning back to face the group, looking rapidly between us. “This is The Thousand. *Die Eintausend*”.

I think about the painting I saw back in the lobby, and I meet the gaze of Blaine, beside me. It’s clear he’s thinking about the same thing.

Rudy swears and runs his hands through his hair. “I didn’t sign up for this, man”.

Szymon unclasps and raises his weapon. He takes a step forwards.

“Hey, HEY!” Rudy calls as voices rise around the group.

&#x200B;

“WAIT!” Manny bellows, his voice cutting through the clamour.

&#x200B;

An uneasy quiet holds the group in check for a moment, and Manny speaks.

“Let’s all just calm down. We are trained professionals, act accordingly”. A frown flickers across his face, and he winces, furrowing his brow as sweat begins to leak down past his hairline.

&#x200B;

“Manny…” Kim says, reaching out, but Manny gently shakes his head, walking towards the tank.

&#x200B;

“What does it do?” Kim ponders aloud, her eyes wide. “I mean, what’s it for?”

&#x200B;

“There was a painting in the room with the statues”. I say to her, and the group. “It was called The Thousand. It showed a lighthouse made of people looking out over a storm”.

“And there was a city”, Blaine adds, as we approach the nearest glass wall of the tank. “Or at least, I think it was. Hard to tell. Ruins, really. Dark and broken spires”.

“There was a painting with the same name on the other side of the hall, too”, Syzmon adds. “It showed a ruin from above, and the layout of the ruin was the same as the Black Sun”. The alien green light reflects in his glasses and obscures his eyes. “The shape was surrounded by six golden eyes”.

We reach the edge of the glass. A large, metal panel has been embedded here, easily taller than myself, and is connected to a series of pipes and mechanisms, many of which feed through the floor.

A plaque of gold and black has been screwed into the panel. It depicts A faded brown photograph alongside a name, and what appears to be a handprint, alongside a list of details written in German.

&#x200B;

The name is that of Manny’s grandfather, and he reveals this to the group.

&#x200B;

“Fuck…” Rudy mutters. “This is insane”.

Blaine grunts. “I see some resemblance, Manny”.

“Perhaps a little…” Manny says, his eyes scanning the information recorded here. “Though personally I have always felt I take more after my mother’s side of the family”.

He reaches up a hand, and places it against the handprint of his grandfather, and instantly recoils with a gasp, clutching his head.

He catches his breath, then furrows his brow, looking up at the tank. “This thing is an insult to humanity”, he grunts. “A tumour. Almost every fibre of my being wants to see it destroyed… but yet… there is something else, as well”.

“What?” Kim asks. “What is it?”

“I keep seeing…” Manny begins, then falters. “I keep seeing glimpses of the water. As if I am in there, amongst them. I see myself through the glass. Distorted. Just quick flashes”.

Syzmon sucks some air in through his teeth. “I think we shut this down. I don’t know why it has been kept active for so long, this disgusting secret… What are we even suggesting, here? Is Manny able to see through the eyes of these… these bodies in the water… Are they *ALIVE?*”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His final word echoes around the room, and is lost to the thrum of the old machinery.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He clenches his jaw, then repeats himself. “I say we shut it down. And I say we shut it down *now*. The tank was built by Nazis. What more do you people need? You think it’s something to be preserved?” He turns and begins to stride around the side of the tank, into the watery shadows thrown by the structure’s eerie light.

Kim hurries after him. “Wait, Szymon, don’t you think we should wait to try and work out what it’s for? Or why it was built?”

Blaine turns to us. “I think I might go back and grab that journal. Couldn’t make much sense of it myself, but Manny can read it. He might have missed something important”.

But as he makes to leave, we hear Syzmon call his name.

“Blaine!” he shouts back through the darkness. “Got another skeleton here. I think it’s the one you were talking about”.

We head over, us tiny specks in the glow of the green tank, and as we approach Szymon and Kim, we find them standing by the side of a skeleton, a skeleton adorned in Western military fatigues and sprawled across the floor.

We consider it for a moment.

“This is no Nazi, obviously”, Rudy murmurs, crouching down and running his fingers around the collar. He lifts an arm to look at the sleeve. “French”, he says. “This’ll be the guy from the report”.

“Wait”, Kim mutters, “no, that can’t be right. The report read that he was killed by a fallen pipe, right? Drowned in a puddle?”

Blaine and I take a step back, and we cast the beams of our torches around the surrounding area. A few of the beams are raised to the high ceiling above.

&#x200B;

…There is no sign above of any disconnected piping or panelling.

&#x200B;

Nor is there any sign of something having fallen.

Aside from the skeleton itself, the ground is unmarked.

There is also no logical place from which a puddle might have formed, or from where such a puddle might have leaked.

&#x200B;

“This guy wasn’t killed by no falling debris”, Rudy says. “Take a look at this, guys”. He lifts his torch and the light falls across the skeleton’s head. It illuminates a single hole, the size of a bullet, in the back of the skeleton’s skull.

“Shot in the back of the head…” Szymon murmurs, anger rising in the back of his voice. “Alright, enough of this!” he shouts, standing straight up. “Enough! Enough of this ridiculous murder mystery”. He jabs a finger towards the tank. “That THING makes me sick, and I’m shutting it down. NOW”. He takes his weapon in hand and strides past the skeleton, back towards the tank.

“Hey, hold on!” Kim says, reaching out for his sleeve, but he shrugs her off.

Rudy positions himself in the man’s way. “For God’s sake just calm DOWN! What the hell’s the matter with you? Got a screw loose or something?”

“What would you know of this?” Szymon snorts, trying to shove his way past. “You don’t understand a thing, no matter how much you might pretend to”.

“And what exactly is that supposed to mean, huh?” Rudy challenges, his voice raising.

Blaine attempts to get between them as an argument breaks out, leaving Manny and myself beside the skeleton. We look at each other.

“There were all manner of curiosities on that plaque”, he says to me, after a beat. “Alongside my grandfather’s picture, and his name. It listed his blood type. Other statistics that I cannot discern the meaning of. Relating, I believe, to activity in different parts of the brain”.

“Manny”, I say to him, rubbing my jaw. “Please, be frank with me. Do you know what this is? Do you know what these bunkers are for?”

Manny shakes his head. “I do not. But I am growing in confidence that the people inside the tank are alive. I believe that the dreams of which I am cursed… Well, this might be a long shot, but… I think they might come from the drifters inside the tank”.

&#x200B;

Goosebumps ripple across my skin.

&#x200B;

“So what do we do?” I ask. “Is Szymon right? Do we try to shut it down?”

“I think we have no choice”, Manny replies.

“So how do we do it?” I ask him. “The guy who wrote the journal said even *he* couldn’t do it”.

“I believe that the fellow in the control room was constrained mentally, Oliver”, Manny says to me. “Not physically. And we have access to technology the Nazis did not. Controlled explosives, for one thing”.

“We can’t use an explosive, Manny”, I tell him. “We have no idea what the stuff in the tank even is; if we use too much and we break the glass-”

“Of course, of course”, Manny interrupts. “I’m not a fool. There will be a way to open the panelling. There is a power keeping them locked up shut”.

“How can you tell?”

“There was light coming through the cracks, but there was no key hole, nor slots for screws. I think there may be some kind of magnet keeping the panels connected to the body of the tank, or at the least, something on the inside”.

“So all we need, is a way to open the panels. Have a look inside…” and even as I say the words I notice, for the first time, the position that the skeleton beneath us is actually in.

He is sprawled across the ground, yes… But he was clearly heading in a certain direction, off to the side, towards the great pipes at the room’s edge. I raise my torch, and I step around the poor, forgotten soldier, walking in the direction that he’d been heading before he was…

&#x200B;

*…before he was shot.*

&#x200B;

Manny accompanies me, and at the very edges of the room, nestled between two enormous pipes and rattling with a faint whirr, is some kind of ancient power box, a generator of sorts, and this thing actually has a door, locked up tight. I look at Manny, and he nods, and takes a step back. I raise my weapon and fire two quick, careful shots into the door’s side. It cracks open, and the sounds of the argument behind us cease at once.

“The hell are you guys doing?” Rudy calls over, and after a smattering of boots on cold concrete we are joined by some of the others.

“Alright, good, now hold on a moment”, Manny says, as he pulls open the busted door with a clank, examining the inside of the generator. “I have seen machines like these before in my career. None identical, of course… But similar enough. Just give me a moment”.

“We’re shooting these things now?” Szymon shouts over. He remains across the hall, bathed in green as he stands by the tank. “So much for waiting and using caution, I guess. Why don’t we just blow the fuck out of this thing?”

“Look, perhaps we’re all getting carried away”, Blaine cuts in. “Are we actually considering destroying the tank? We don’t KNOW what it IS. Now, I don’t know why the previous recon teams decided to keep it a secret, but, they obviously knew something we didn’t. Perhaps we spend a little more time looking around, at least?”

“We should report this”, Kim says. “Let’s just get out of here and tell Command everything we know”.

“Got it”, Manny mutters to himself, as he makes a decision, then reaches out and flicks a switch. He unplugs a cord, then pulls down on a lever on the right hand side.

&#x200B;

There is a low groan that rumbles throughout the bunker.

&#x200B;

The green light flickers momentarily, and with a cloud of dust and a metallic clattering, I see the silhouettes of several panels falling from the side of the tank.

“Now”, Manny says, rubbing some dark grease from his hands. “Let’s take a look at what we’re working with here. As Blaine suggests, there is clearly more to learn about this place. We take a slow, and measured approach to this. We have no idea what we’re working with, so we consider every juncture with caution. We cannot rule out simply giving a full report to Command, but there must be a reason as to why we’ve never heard about all this before”. He looks between us, from Blaine, to Kim, to Rudy, and myself. “Now. I have some theories, regarding the people in the tank-”

I catch movement in the corner of my eye, and I see the silhouette of Szymon working hurriedly away in the freshly-exposed inner mechanisms of the great green tank, formerly hidden behind the panels.

“Hey”, I mutter, then a little louder: “HEY! Syzmon! What are you doing?”

Szymon does not respond. He simply slams something into place and then makes a break for it. He hurries over to us, his expression hidden in shadow.

“Szymon…” Kim begins, as a low beeping becomes suddenly audible. “Syzmon”, she repeats, a little more urgently. “…What have you done?”

The man comes into view, and as the shadows swim across his face and the reflected green flashes over his eyes, I catch a glimpse of his expression.

A wide, manic grin, eyes wide and fierce.

He tilts his head as he runs, and presses a finger against the ear closest to the tank.

What follows is the sound of an explosion, loud and sharp and clear, cutting through the murmur and whirr of the bunker like a blade. Shadows of metal and rubber and God knows what else burst with a sudden force from the place that Szymon was tinkering, and the green of the tank begins to falter.

I grimace and wince as a low ring begins to chime in my ears; I push my way past the man and run towards the front of the tank.

&#x200B;

The entire panel- with the picture of Manny’s grandfather and the information alongside- has been blown to shreds.

&#x200B;

Staring into the dark hole that Szymon has blown in the mechanism of the tank’s… filter…? I’m not sure what it is, but looking inside, at the steadily grinding gears, the deflating pumps and the leaking ooze and grease and fluid… It’s like looking into the open wound of a monstrous, dying animal.

I retreat, looking up in shock as, from this fresh wound, a dark, thick sludge begins to leak into the glowing green waters.

Manny gasps aloud and collapses to his knees, holding his head. Kim rushes to his side, as the rest of us watch the sludge disperse and billow out like a slow, toxic cloud throughout the water.

The drifting souls… It seems to me that they try their best to avoid it, for as long as they can. In the manner that a jellyfish might try to avoid a beam of light, in its slow, and meandering way… But one by one they are all enveloped, and the green liquid turns steadily grey, and then black.

I watch in cold horror as the hundreds upon hundreds of bodies begin to *melt*.

They lose whatever sense of orientation they might once have possessed. They are washed against each other, and where they touch they dissolve. There’s no other word for it. Pieces begin to break away, sinking slowly and sickening to the base of the tank, where they are gradually lost to the darkness.

&#x200B;

I hear a scream, and I wheel around.

&#x200B;

Kim clutches to Manny, as the guy begins to shake.

“Manny?” Blaine asks, squatting down to grab the man’s shoulder. “MANNY!”

Szymon watches on. His grin is gone now. He has paled, and I can see his chest rising and falling as he looks at our seizing comrade.

Manny opens his mouth as if to speak, but instead comes only a rasping breath.

Clear liquid begins to pour from his ears, liquid that turns quickly grey, then red. It pours over his uniform, staining it, and splashes across the floor.

&#x200B;

His eyes roll up into his head, and seconds later the seizing stops.

He slumps to the concrete ground.

&#x200B;

Utterly lifeless.

&#x200B;

And just like that, he’s gone.
