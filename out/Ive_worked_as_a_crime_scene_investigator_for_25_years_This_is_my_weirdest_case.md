On the 25th of November 2018, the victim pulled into a budget motel in the early hours of the morning. He booked room 12 for a three day stay, and on the fourth day the owner of the establishment sent his son to check on the victim. What he found was something that someone his age should never have witnessed. Or anyone for that matter. 

By the time I arrived at the scene, it had already been cordoned off. Members of the county police department had swarmed the area and in the absence of the sun, it was the blue and red flashing lights that cast their glow over the building. I made my way past the tenants who were half-asleep, doing their best at giving witness testimonial.I stepped by a particularly shaken forensic pathologist who was trying to call his mother and entered room 12. 

Now, I've been working as a crime scene investigator for more than twenty years. I have dealt with some truly confounding scenes before. In 2006, a body of a missing hiker was found in the woods just on the county line. It had been burnt to a crisp, but only the upper half. Below the waist was completely untouched, as was the surrounding area. 

More recently, a farmer reported a break in just after New year's eve. Presumably, someone had broken into his warehouse which housed an industrial animal carcass shredder. It had been used in the night and a pile of jellied flesh was found clumped at its mouth. Horrifically, it was eventually proven to be human, although couldn't be identified beyond that. Only one other thing was found at the scene. Within the remains was a small steel plaque, about the size of a business card, with the number 0002916 engraved in it.

I say all this for simple context. I am no stranger to the unexplainable, but what I saw in Room 12… it still keeps me up at night. The following are excerpts from the crime scene report I filed that day. 


Incident Number: 24-0711
Date of Incident: November 29, 2018
Time of Arrival: 11:54 PM
Location: Room 12, Sir Sleep-a-Lot Motel, [REDACTED] County
Reporting Officer: Detective [REDACTED]

Victim name: John Doe (Name yet to be confirmed through fingerprint or DNA)
Gender: male
Age: estimated to be mid-40s
Occupation: unknown 

Suspects: none at present 

The victim checked into the ‘Sir Sleep-a-Lot’ Motel on the morning of November 25th, 2018. He informed the motel owner, Mr John K, that he would be staying for three days. No known associates or visitors during the stay.

Victim was found laying on bed in supine position. Victim had skin removed crudely. Patches of flesh hang loosely, revealing bone in some areas. Teeth indents on right part of pelvic bone will be examined. The victim's head is absent from the scene. Notably, the body had been dressed in what appeared to be women’s undergarments, specifically a pair of lace stockings and a torn satin slip. Neither items of clothing belonged to the victim.  The body was likely dressed post-mortem. 

Addendum: Marks on right part of pelvic bone were positively identified as being from a human juvenile, estimated as between the ages of three and six. No dental record have been traced. 

Blood covers every inch of the room's four walls and carpet. The blood spray appears to be inconsistent with splatter from traumatic injury, possible use of pressurised device. The amount of blood was determined to be approximately two gallons, or 135% of the victim's total volume. 

Teeth were found on the room's desk, thirty-three in total arranged into a circular pattern ten inches in diameter. The careful arrangement appears to be ritualistic. The teeth are currently assumed to have been belonging to the victim. The location of the victim's head has not been identified.

Addendum: The findings of the forensic odontologist have determined that thirty-two of the thirty-three teeth belonged to a person matching the victim's description; a caucasian male in his forties. One of the teeth matches a younger caucasian female. It was eventually connected through dental records to be from twenty-four year old [REDACTED] Hadland, reported missing in 1997. The Hadland case was archived in 1999 due to absence of evidence. 

The victim’s tongue was discovered in the bathroom sink, exhibiting a complete severance at the base. The incision appeared clean and precise, suggesting the use of a surgical-grade or extremely sharp cutting instrument. Notably, the tongue was found in isolation within the sink, devoid of any other biological material, indicating that it may have been intentionally relocated post-excision. 

First responders noted signs of tampering on the coin-operated television in the room, which intermittently activated to static approximately once an hour. The television will be deconstructed for forensic examination to recover latent fingerprints and other trace evidence related to its manipulation.

Addendum: Both of the victim's eyes were recovered from the interior of the room's coin-operated television. The television screen had been removed and the eyes were placed within the cavity where the cathode ray tube was situated. This positioning suggests deliberate placement, indicating a possible symbolic motive.

The only item of clothing found at the scene belonging to the victim was one pair of denim jeans, which witness John K recalls being worn by the victim the morning he checked in. The jeans were contaminated with the victim's blood. In the pockets were found a one-way bus ticket, one packet of apple flavoured gum and a button. No other possessions of the victim were found. A pair of small, leather lace-up shoes were found at the foot of the bed. From the lack of blood stains, we can assume the shoes were placed there after the homicide. 

Addendum A: A shirt likely belonging to the victim was found three weeks later partially buried in a field in [REDACTED], a small town 240 miles south of the crime scene. The shirt matched the description given by John K of the victim. Blood samples taken from the shirt were a strong match to those taken from the crime scene, although without the identity of the victim a definitive link is challenging to corroborate.

Addendum B: The small shoes found at the crime scene were dated to 1909 and determined to have some value among antique dealers. Due to their small size they can be assumed to be children's shoes. 

The room showed no obvious signs of damage. The furniture appeared to have been undisturbed although a Bible was missing from the bedside cabinet. Neither John K nor his son David, lead witnesses of the case, recall seeing the victim with any luggage. For this reason, it is unclear if his possessions were taken or if he simply had none to begin with. The motive of this homicide remains unclear. 


I'll save you the rest of the procedural formalities. I've lost track of how many nights I've spent awake, staring at my computer screen reading and rereading this report. It's stayed with me for the past six years, constantly at the back of mind. At my personal behest, the case remained open despite insufficient evidence and a complete lack of any leads. When it was finally shelved at the beginning of this year, they were no closer to solving it than we were the day we found him. 

Earlier this week, I learnt that it had been reopened by the FBI. I assumed that there must be someone else in this department who felt the same way about the case as I did, strong enough to reach out and request assistance from the feds. I was tasked with compiling any and all digital evidence we had on the case onto a USB flash. 

I felt weird combing through all the reports, files and forensics. It felt like I was visiting an old friend. I added the documents I wrote up on the day, the dozens of crime scene photos and witness statements. I've studied them all meticulously myself. I doubted some Yale boy with a corner office could do any better. 

I kept trailing through the earmarked files, checking and double checking if there was anything I'd missed. It was dark now. I spent the day working from home, hunched over my computer in my sorry excuse for a library. That's what my job mostly consists of now. I couldn't wait for retirement. Maybe then I would have the time to read some of these books I have lying around.

I decided I was finished for the night. I'd squeezed every piece of relevant information I could find onto that hard drive. It was up to the FBI now. I only hoped that if our victim left any family behind, they could one day get some closure from this. I was about to shut my computer down when something caught my eye.

Witness_1.mp3 

It was an audio file. Somehow I hadn't noticed it before. Hell, I don't think I had even listened to it before. To my knowledge, all the Witness statements taken that night were written. I clicked on it, figuring it must've been taken from David K, the kid who'd found the body. 

I took a sip of my last dregs of coffee and sat back in my chair, jacking up the volume. The audio wasn't the best quality. It was shrouded in the static of an analogue recording and to my shock, the supposed ‘1st witness’ had a woman's voice. The following is a transcript of what was on that file.

First responder: "What were you doing in the area before you discovered the body?”

Witness 1: “I'm staying in Room 14, the room next door to where it happened. Been there for the past two weeks, thereabouts. I've come on hard times recently, you know how it is. I was living out of a van until this, but it wasn't exactly reliable.”

First responder: Apologies ma'am, I meant what were you doing immediately before discovering the body.

Witness 1: Right… Well, I came back from work around nine. I clean at the elementary school in town. I came back and spent the rest of the day in my room. I had dinner and I was just catching up with the news before I went to sleep.”

First responder: “Can you describe how and when you found the body?”

Witness 1: “Gee, it must've been around ten. I was turning in for the night when I heard a banging noise from next door. I guessed he must've brought a lady friend over so I tried my best to ignore it, but it kept getting louder. It didn't sound like a headboard neither, more like someone chopping wood. It was too much for me to ignore so I got up to go complain. I found the door unlocked and it opened wide up when I knocked. That's when I saw him that poor, poor man.”

First responder: “Could you please describe the scene you came across as detailed as you can?”

Witness 1: “It was terrible, just terrible. I saw my neighbour kneeling in the corner of his room. His head had been cut off! Can you imagine that? There was blood covering everything around him. I almost vomited there and then. Then I saw the man in the bathroom.”

 *there's a pause*

First responder: “Could you please go on? You said there was someone else at the scene?”

Witness 1: “Yeah… a real weirdo. I didn't notice him at first. He was just peeking out from behind the bathroom door, watching me. When I did finally notice him, we just stared at each other for a moment or two. Then he just strolled out from his little hiding place." 

*another pause*

First responder: “Please continue, I assure you everything you have to say will be of some importance to our investigation. Start by describing this man you saw.”

Witness 1: OK then. He was a freak, I'll say it. When I got a good look at him I saw that he had this great bulbous head. He was bald as a newborn and the entire back part of his head was all deformed and sagging down. I think he had this disease. Oh what's it called? A boy I went to school with had it…”

First responder: “Are you thinking of hydrocephalus?”

Witness 1: Yes! Yeah, that's it. Hydrocephalus. But it was much worse than that kid I knew. Sorry if i'm coming across as rude but It looked like some horrible octopus. And the front part of his head was far too thin. He has this pointy chin and cheekbones. His eyes were as bulging as his skull. All yellow and white, I think he had cataracts. Oh, and he must've been around seven feet tall, at least. He was hunching over where he met the ceiling.

First responder: “Can you describe what he was wearing?”

Witness 1: “Sure… he had this battered old duster coat on. It was black, but he was covered in these stitched rags of red and green. The coat hung down to the floor, but I could make out the tips of brown leather boots poking out from the hem.”

First responder: “Can you-”

Witness 1: “Oh! Pardon my interrupting, but the man, he was holding this… Well I don't know what it was. It looked like a lobster pot with a handle and must be two dozen blades sticking out of it. Knives mostly, and razor blades, axe heads, chains, that sort of stuff. Anyway, go on.”

First responder: “Right. What did you do when he came closer to you?” 

Witness 1: “Well I ran. I just ran. Out of the motel and down the road until I realised everything I owned was in my room. I didn't fancy having to start over from nothing for a third time so I came back, and that's when you bumped into me.”

First responder: “Alright, and how long was it from discovering the body until you called 911?”

Witness 1: “Oh I didn't call 911, honey.”

First responder: “You… didn't?”

Witness 1: “Oh no, by the time I came back from my little jog the place was already crawling with police. I still haven't been allowed back in my room.”

First responder: “Are you aware that-”

*End*

His speech became muffled after that until the recording was nothing but static hum that'd been in the background since the beginning. After hearing this for the first time I didn't know what to think. I just sat in my old oak chair until my wife came in to tell me that she was going to bed. I kissed her goodnight and went back to aimlessly staring at the computer screen. Eventually, I closed it and stood up. I took the usb stick and left it on my desk. I left the room and locked the door behind me. I changed, washed and climbed into bed with my wife. I kissed her on the back of her neck and tried to fall asleep. That… thing that did this was still out there. But that wasn't my problem anymore.
