I’ve always loved horror stories. When you’re a kid most of the world is so unknowable it feels mysterious, like anything at all could be possible, you just haven’t seen it yet. When you grow up of course, the magic wears off and the boring reality of closets without monsters and dark rooms with nothing to hide sets in.

As ten-year-old obsessed with scary books and campfire stories, I believed in everything, and wanted nothing more than to prove their reality. I spent hours walking the trails near my house on dark foggy days, and stayed up long after my parents were asleep in hopes of seeing a flickering light or a couch moving by itself. I was terrified and fascinated all at once, and I was sure there was something out there that only I could discover.

My first taste of the supernatural, was from a story my best friend Jack told me when we were around seven or eight. His family had moved house only recently and one of the reasons, he told me, was because their old one was haunted.

One night, he was lying in bed trying to sleep when he heard voices coming from down the hallway. He thought nothing of it at first, it was probably his parents so he turned over and tried to fall asleep. But the longer it went on, the more he listened to them. There was only one voice, female, but it didn’t sound like his mother or sister.

So he got out of bed, put on his dressing gown and walked to the door. Pressing his ear against it, he could hear the voice louder but he couldn’t tell what it was saying. He opened the door as slowly as he could. Yellow light from the hallway spilled through the widening gap. He stepped out and walked down the hallway and around the corner, but there was no one around.

Then he heard the whispers coming from downstairs, but by the time he got to the bottom they were gone. He stood still on the last step for a few moments, looking out into the dark living room. He couldn’t see anyone, and he didn’t want to look any further.

It doesn’t sound very convincing looking back, but it creeped the hell out of me at that age, especially when he told me his parents had heard the voice before. And when they told him the last owner, an old lady, had died in the house, that was all the both of us needed to believe without question. The house was definitely haunted and that was definitely why they moved out.

The other big ghost story at that age was told to us by another friend, a tall redheaded kid called Alex. Alex’s story came from his older brother, a sixteen-year-old who, to us, gave the tale ultimate authority. It was a ritual, he said, you go into a bathroom, run both the taps in the sink, turn out all the lights and look at yourself in the mirror. Then you close your eyes and say “Bloody Mary!” three times. When you open your eyes, you see a woman’s face in the mirror covered in blood, and then she kills you.

This one was pretty silly, especially as I now know it’s an urban legend that goes back decades in England. But I’ll never forget how scared I felt standing alone in the schoolyard while Jack and a few of the other boys went into the bathroom to try it out. I was so sure I’d never see Jack again.

When I was eleven, I started my first year of secondary school. That was where I first heard about the monster in the woods. At that age I was allowed to play browser games on my dad’s laptop at the weekends, and when no one was looking I would scour the web for ghost stories and urban legends. I became hooked and read through probably hundreds of short tales on forums and local myths on forgotten websites.

I memorised my favourites and would sit around with my friends at school at lunchtime, telling them as best I could. I wasn’t much of a storyteller but I had a great time trying to scare everyone. All boys at that age seemed to enjoy a scary story, but only two loved them as much as me, Jack and my other best friend at the time, Roger. Roger was tall and confident and was the social butterfly of our trio. While Jack and I were quiet he was loud and funny and always making new friends. We got on like a house on fire.

It was Roger who first told us about the monster. Walking home from school one sunny afternoon, talking and joking, he said “Do you guys know the Gnawbone?”

“What’s the Gnawbone?” I asked, immediately serious.

“It’s a monster in the forest down Landing Lane,” He said.

“You just made that up!” Said Jack.

“Nuh uh, Simon told me.”

“Simon’s a liar Roger,” Said Jack, “He’s just joking with you.”

“No way,” Said Roger, shaking his head, “He heard about some kids from Drury Road school that went down there a few weeks ago and got chased out by the Gnawbone!”

“We’re not stupid,” Said Jack.

“What did it look like?” I asked.

“It was like, white all over and had these huge teeth,” Roger said, indicating with is hands, “And it crawled like a dog and ran after them!”

“I don’t believe it,” Said Jack, “Why wouldn’t the police do something about it?”

“Don’t be stupid Jack, the police wouldn’t believe them anyway,” I said, “We’ve got to go check it out guys.”

“Yes! We’ll hunt this thing down and kill it!” Said Roger.

“Okay then, but I still think it’s a joke,” Said Jack.

“We better be prepared though,” I said, “The Gnawbone sounds pretty dangerous.”

“We’ll bring some weapons,” Said Roger, “It’ll be no match for us!”

“I’ll get my dad’s flashlight. Meet by the Landing Lane sign tonight then,” I said.

We ran back home grinning; we were finally going to catch a real-life monster.

I could hardly sit still during dinner and the clock seemed to be going much slower than usual. At last the sun began to set and I told my parents I was going out to Jack’s house for a sleepover. It was the weekend tomorrow so I knew they wouldn’t mind.

I stepped out the door with my father’s big silver flashlight in one hand and a toy sword tucked inside my belt. It was made of hard, thick wood with a red painted handle and I thought it would do some serious damage if we got into any danger. I set out for Landing Lane ready for adventure.

When I reached the sign, Jack and Roger were already waiting for me. Jack was holding a ring spanner and Roger was holding a small plastic gun that fired rubber darts.

“The Gnawbone’s gonna be fucked!” Said Roger, seeing my sword.

“If we can even find it,” Said Jack.

“I was going to bring the cap gun I modified,” Said Roger, “You know, the one that shoots real bullets? But I left it at my cousins house.”

“This stuff’ll be good enough,” I said, “Come on, let’s go.”

We started down the path as the sun sunk down over the horizon. Landing Lane went up from a cul-de-sac off the main road and wound down through a series of fields and little country houses. But a short way up it there was a narrow dirt trail that ran off downhill and along a river that went for miles. We turned down and followed the trail, where it quickly became dense in trees and overgrown grass.

“Where did they see the Gnawbone?” I asked Roger.

“I think it was past the weir,” He said, “Where the woods are.”

We crossed the footbridge and came to the fork in the trail. If you turn right, you follow the river across miles of open country. If you turn left, you go past the weir and into the woods. We turned left.

“Cliff, turn the flashlight on!” Jack said to me. It was getting dark now and it was hard to see where we were going. I found the rubber button with my thumb, but when I clicked it, nothing happened.

“Isn’t it working?” Said Roger.

“Hang on,” I said, hitting the top a few times. It came to life and lit up the weir in front of us. I clicked it to the highest setting.

“Wow, that’s great!” Said Roger, “We can see anything with this.”

We trudged along in unison, me sweeping the flashlight and Roger pointing his dart gun ahead with both hands. We followed the trail across the creek and up a dirt hill where the trees leaned together, blocking out almost all of the moonlight. We had been in the woods several minutes when Roger stopped us.

“Look over there, I think I see something,” He said, pointing through the brush and past the fence.

“We’re not supposed to leave the trail, Roger!” I said.

“This is important, we’re the only ones with a chance to catch it,” He said.

I decided he was right and Jack agreed, so we stepped off the trail and over the rotting fence. We continued walking at a slower pace, the brush was thick and we had to constantly push through branches and leaves to make progress. We couldn’t see much in front of us anymore as the flashlight only lit up as far as the next tree hanging down in our way.

“What did you see up here Roger?” Asked Jack.

“I don’t know, it just looked interesting,” He replied, “Keep going we’ll find something soon.”

We pressed forward until we came to a clearing with a line of pine trees on one side and the dirt covered in dead autumn leaves.

“Hey, check this out!” Said Jack. He was crouched in the dirt holding a burgundy wool scarf. Roger and I walked over to him.

“Monsters don’t wear scarfs dummy,” Said Roger.

“No but someone was out here! How did they find it when we went off the trail?” Said Jack.

“Let’s keep looking,” I said, excitement growing.

I walked past the bush we’d came through and pointed the flashlight out down the row of pine trees. The clearing stretched out farther than I could see.

“Hey, I think this is a path guys,” I said.

“Awesome, maybe this is the Gnawbone’s den!” Said Roger.

We huddled together and walked along the hidden road. I took the sword out of my belt and brandished it in front of me. Roger pointed the dart gun ahead and Jack readied the spanner. We crept along looking for signs of a den.

Snap! We spun around in unison pointing our light and weapons in the direction of the sound. It sounded like a twig snapping but we saw no culprit.

“You guys heard that too, right?” Said Jack.

“Let’s go quicker guys,” Said Roger.

We walked faster, throwing glances over our shoulders, until something big came into the view of the flashlight. It was a house. A big old brick house with two storeys and a big chimney on the roof. The bricks were cracked behind layers of moss, the roof was missing tiles and half the windows were smashed in.

“Woah, what’s that?” I whispered.

“This must be where the Gnawbone lives,” Replied Roger.

We walked towards the house and saw no one around. The door was open and there was a faded sign above it. *St Margaret’s Home for the Chronically Insane.*

“Wow, it’s an old asylum!” Said Jack.

“What’s an asylum?” Asked Roger.

“It’s where you go if you’re crazy,” Said Jack, “Don’t you live in one?”

We laughed and shone the flashlight through some of the ground floor windows. We couldn’t make out any people or any furniture inside.

“Should we go in?” Said Roger, suddenly seeming a little less confident than usual.

“Okay,” I said. Battling the Gnawbone didn’t seem so easy now we were here. We crept up the steps and peered through the door. It looked empty.

“You go first,” Said Roger.

“No way, you’ve got a gun!” I replied.

Roger stepped up to the doorframe and put his back against the wall, gun in both hands. He then spun around and strode inside with it pointed in front of him, just like we’d seen cops do in movies.

“This room’s clear,” He whispered. We followed him inside. The room looked like it used to be a reception area with a long wooden desk built into the corner and a stairwell leading up to the next floor.

“Let’s go upstairs,” I said, “It’s probably hidden up there.”

Roger led the way up the stairwell and we stepped into a large ward lined with rusty metal hospital beds.

“This is so creepy guys,” Said Roger.

I walked along the room, swinging the flashlight across everything. Then I stopped dead, light pointing at the wall.

“Guys…” I said, “Look at this…”

On the wall was some graffiti written in green spray paint. It said:

*I walk the trees, night by night*

*I know each one by name and sight*

*I find the children all alone*

*And rip and tear and gnaw the bones*

“What the fuck?” Said Roger.

“That’s so creepy,” Said Jack, “I wonder who wrote it?”

“I think we should get out of here,” I said.

“Yeah, he’s probably not here anyways,” Said Roger, “Gnawbone got off lucky tonight.”

Jack and I managed a chuckle and we headed downstairs. We stepped out the door and walked down the way we came. The atmosphere was lighter now we were heading home, and we laughed and joked as we strode through the leaves. Roger just got to the end of a funny story about his cousin when we heard it. Footsteps.

We must have been making quite a lot of noise as we came down so we didn’t notice it at first but in the silence it was obvious. We all froze in our tracks and the footsteps stopped a second later. We stood there a moment, too scared to turn around.

“Did you guys hear that?” I whispered as quietly as I could. I saw them nod. I motioned for them to keep walking again, hoping desperately that we were mistaken. But we weren’t. I heard the footsteps start again with us, trying to keep in rhythm with ours but not quite succeeding.

“Run!” I yelled, and we took off sprinting across the leaves.

“Look for the scarf,” Yelled Jack, “That’s where we turned off!”

As we ran, I was sure I heard the footsteps start to run as well. Without turning, I threw my sword behind me as hard as I could, but I didn’t hear it hit anything, just the sound as it dropped to the dirt.

I saw the scarf up ahead and the hole in the bushes where we came out from. We dived in and began the fight through the greenery. It seemed even more dense and hard to push through now, and I was running low on energy. It was a cold night in autumn, and I wished I had worn my coat. Then I tripped on a tree root and hit the ground. The flashlight fell from my hand and went out, my friends pulled me up and grabbed it but it wouldn’t turn on again, even when I hit it. We had no choice but to push on without light and find our way home.

We finally made it back to the trail, covered in scratches and nettle stings. We stopped for a second to catch our breath but I heard rustling back where we came from and we sprinted down the trail, hoping we had picked the right direction. I knew we did when I saw the river emerge from the trees in the moonlight. We were almost safe.

When we were far enough away from the woods, we went the rest of the way at a quick walk. None of us had heard footsteps in a little while but we didn’t feel much better. After what seemed like an eternity, we were off the trail and back on the paved footpath of Landing Lane. We walked down to the cul-de-sac and under the street lamps, the first light we’d seen for a while.

We walked to the main road and set off up the hill to Roger’s house for night. We knew his parents wouldn’t mind us being out so late as long as we were quiet. As we lay in our blankets piled on Roger’s floor, we discussed what had happened on our adventure. It was definitely the Gnawbone following us, we decided, and we’d tell everyone at school on Monday.

When Monday came around, most of them didn’t believe us of course. We were too well known as horror fans to make any kind of convincing case for our encounter out in the woods, even when Roger showed his scratches to anyone who would look. But it didn’t matter to us. We knew what had happened, and were certain we’d had a close encounter with the paranormal. As excited as we were though, we never went down Landing Lane after dark again.

Things went on as normal after that. I was still reading horror stories and still obsessed with proving them to be real. I wrote off the Gnawbone as a confirmed case and moved on to others, though I never got anywhere as close to any of them. As we got older, Roger and his family moved away. We tried to stay in touch but you know how it goes when you’re little. He was a three-hour car ride away and to us he might as well have been on the moon. Jack and I never saw him again after we turned twelve.

Eventually, I left school, got a job and moved out of town. I still kept in touch with Jack but I got busy and didn’t see him as often as I wanted too. Until one day, at the ripe old age of twenty-four, I got a call from him.
