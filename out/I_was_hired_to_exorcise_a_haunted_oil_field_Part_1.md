[Part2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jx5324/i_was_hired_to_exorcise_a_haunted_oil_field_part_2/)

I’ve exorcised over thirty demons in my career, and not a single one was real.

I have a childhood friend who became a priest years ago, and when he’s on vacation, he lets me take care of the church. Well… I take care of the church.

You gonna ask how? Well, I sell the wine so it doesn’t go to waste. I exorcise demons so people shouldn’t need to wait until my friend returns. Anyways, one day—

It was a hot summer night. I was sitting at home watching a football game, already three beers in, drinking the fourth, eating chips, smoking cigarettes.

My doorbell rang.

I wasn’t expecting anyone, so I got curious and opened the door. In front of me stood a guy in his late thirties, wearing a suit. Black hair, black tie, blue eyes. Pretty handsome fella.

“The fuck you waiting for to talk?”

“Is this the house of Mr. Nox? If it is, can I talk to him?”

“You already talking.”

“Hi Mr. Nox. I’m working for an oil company that has a field in a nearby area.”

“Wow, what a cool guy.”

“I believe you want to come straight to the point.”

“And a smart guy too.”

“We might have a problem that needs your expertise. I’m here for a job offer.”

“Well, come inside then.”

I turned back and walked inside. He followed me and shut the door. I sat down on my couch and he took the chair in front of me. I took a sip from my beer and asked:

“So what’s your ‘problem’?”

“Our workers believe a spirit is haunting the oil pump. And I heard that you deal with that kind of thing.”

“Sure. What makes them think that?”

“They say they heard noises, saw things. The climax was yesterday, when one of the workers went missing at night. They’re refusing to work now. Saying the place is cursed.”

“And you want me to exorcise it, right?”

“Yes.”

“Where’d you hear my name?”

“Workers suggested.”

“Did they tell you about my rates?”

“I don’t recall that.”

“Well, standard rate is five G.”

“Sure. No problem.”

“Okay then. When do you need the service?”

“Immediately.”

“That’ll be extra.”

“No problem. Can we proceed now?”

“Sure. Let me get dressed.”

I got up from my couch and headed to my room. Opened my closet and grabbed the only suit I have — black pants, black jacket, white worn-down shirt. I dressed, looked in the mirror.

Medium-length messy beard. Short, slicked-back blond hair, just as messy as the beard. Brown eyes. Big, ugly nose. I looked at myself, smiled. I knew money was coming.

“You are one ugly son of a bitch.”

I grabbed the duffel bag sitting under the mirror, returned to the living room, and said to the guy:

“Come on, fella. Let’s go.”

I turned off the TV, grabbed my cigarettes, went to the door, turned off the lights, put on my shoes, opened the door, walked out with the guy, locked it behind me, and headed to his car.

He had one fancy, new model. Looked good. I got in.

He started driving. We didn’t talk much until I pulled out a cigarette and lit it. He glanced over as I rolled down the window.

“No smoking inside the car, Mr. Nox.”

“How long until we reach the field?”

“Approximately thirty minutes.”

“Well, I’m bored. And I’ll need a way to pass the time.”

“Smoking is one?”

“Yeah. Now shut up and let me enjoy it.”

I smoked in silence. When I finished, I flicked the butt out the window, rolled it up, and asked:

“Tell me everything you know about the situation, Mr... what was your name?”

“You can call me Edward, Mr. Nox.”

“Alright, Edward. Let me hear the story. When did it start?”

“Approximately a week ago. It started small. Some said they heard noise. Some said they saw weird things. But yesterday, someone went missing, and everything went out of control.”

“What’s the sheriff say about the disappearance?”

“They’re searching.”

“Did the guy have any family?”

“No, he doesn’t.”

“Normaly spirits like this tend to target lonely people. You have family, Edward?”

He glanced at me and then back at the road.

“I take it that’s a no, then.”

“The foreman will give you everything you want to hear when we arrive.”

“Yeah.” I leaned back in the seat, closed my eyes.

“Wake me up, will you?” I said, as I dozed off.

Edward woke me up and I got out of the car. I looked around and saw the oil pumps standing still. Dust everywhere. Air smelled like petrol. Workers were all over the place, sitting around a fire.

We walked toward a man in a vest. He came up to us and extended his hand to me.

"Foreman Jones."

"Mr. Nox or Priest Nox. Both fine."

"Nice to meet you, Priest Nox. I believe Mr. Edward here talked to you about the problem."

"Yeah. I want details. But get me a cup of coffee first. And is there somewhere we can sit besides out here?"

"Sure. We can sit in one of the containers."

"Lead the way then."

I followed the foreman, observing the workers’ faces as we walked. They looked tired and scared. Whatever was going on had them real shaken up.

But it was nothing for a professional like me, anyways.

We got inside the container. Foreman grabbed a cup of coffee from the machine and sat down in a chair. I sat across from him, took a sip, then looked at him as I grabbed my cigarette pack from my pocket.

"Mind if I smoke?" I asked.

"Go on, Mr. Priest. Be our guest."

"So, Mr. Jones... what's your problem?"

"Some people quit overnight. Equipment broke without a cause. And lastly, a guy went missing yesterday. He was a loved guy."

"Couple days ago, a sludgy thing came up from underground. We tested it, and it wasn’t oil. We still don’t know what it is."

"There’s a sleeping trailer here that the workers abandoned. Claiming they heard noises. One said he saw something come out of the wall."

"Also, for days, people say they’ve been hearing noises while working at night."

"What kinda noises?" I asked, mocking him inside.

"All kinds. Metal noises. Speaking."

"Speaking? What does it say?"

"They say they can’t understand."

"Did you hear anything?"

"I did."

"Well, I kinda have an idea what it is."

"It’s probably a vengeful spirit causing trouble. I’ll exorcise it tomorrow."

"Tomorrow? Why?"

I puffed and smiled, mocking the man.

"Because you can’t exorcise a spirit at night."

"Well, you’re the pro. What should I tell the people then?"

"Anything you want. I don’t care. Is that abandoned trailer intact?"

"Why you asking?"

"I’m gonna sleep."

"There? Are you sure?"

"Yeah. I’ll also show the people there’s nothing to be afraid of."

"As you ask."

"Lead the way then."

He got up. I got up and followed him. He showed me the trailer, and I dismissed him, walking toward it. I arrived at the front of the door, and just as I was gonna open it,

A wrench dropped at my feet.

I looked up. No one was there. It was weird, but I laughed and said:

"Wow. A spirit throwing a wrench at me. So funny."

As I opened the door, I heard whispers. The one word I could hear clearly was "Priest."

Workers were already gossiping.

I went inside and flicked on the lights. The trailer was pretty basic—a little fridge, some kitchen tools, four beds, etc. I took out my clothes and grabbed my pajamas from my bag. I put them on and headed to bed, sleeping like a baby instantly.

"Mr. Nox."

"Mr. Nox, can you wake up?"

"Mr. Nox, can you please wake up?"

That annoying fella Edward was murmuring beside me. I didn’t even open my eyes.

"What you want?"

"Mr. Nox, it’s morning. Can you wake up? Workers are even angrier. They say something was lurking around last night."

"What’s the hour?"

"It’s eight in the morning, Can you wake up so we can proceed with the... ‘thing’?"

"Yeah. I need to sleep a little more. It’s no time for exorcism now, anyway."

"Mr. Nox, you need to wake up right now, or else I will terminate our deal."

That guy really irritated me at that moment. So I got up, washed my face, dressed in my suit, grabbed my bag, and followed him outside.

As we got out, I stopped and asked:

"Can I grab a cup of coffee first, at least?"

"Mr. Nox, please. Let’s proceed with whatever you’re gonna do."

"Alright, alright. Call everyone outside and bring me the foreman."

"Sure, but Mr. Nox—before we start, there’s something we need to discuss."

"What is it?"

"Workers want you to stay here for a couple days. If you’re okay with it."

"That’ll be two G for every day I stay here. And two G extra for yesterday."

"No problem."

"Good."

I grabbed and lit a cigarette while I waited for the foreman. He came quickly, and I looked around, trying to figure out how to put on a show.

Workers were scattered in different places, all with excited eyes, waiting for me to save them. As I looked around, he asked:

"So, Mr. Nox, what are you gonna do?"

"I’m gonna do a little ritual. Everyone needs to be watching. Then work should start again, and we’ll see if there’s a problem or not."

"Alright."

"Now, don’t talk to me or touch me while I perform the ritual, okay?"

"Got it, Priest."

I grabbed my bag, opened it up, and took out a red carpet. Rolled it out on the ground. Took out four candle holders and stuck them into the ground in a square. I lit them and sat in the middle, closed my eyes, and stayed like that for around fifteen minutes.

As ı slowly got up—

And just as I did, a loud noise hit. A big splash of oil came shooting out of the ground near the pump in front of me.

Everyone screamed and ran around me.

Well… I shit my pants right there.

The foreman ran up and asked:

"What’s going on, Priest? What is this?"

I was frozen. Scared to hell. I didn’t know what to do or what it was, but I knew one thing—I wasn’t leaving without my money. And I was in some serious shit right now.

So, I pulled my move.

I looked at the foreman and said, in a very cocky tone:

"Uhh… this? This is nothing. It’s just the spirit leaving the scene. Nothing to worry about."

"Go calm ‘em down and start working. I’m gonna have breakfast."

The foreman left, and I went to the lunch area. Edward was there, drinking a cup of coffee and talking to someone on the phone. I sat down in front of him and waited for him to finish his talk.

Soon, people were screaming outside again. I got up to check.

And, well… I wish I hadn’t.

On top of one of the pumps, someone was hanging.

And under it, three people were staring up at him—blankly. Not moving. Not talking. Unconscious.

We approached them, tried to talk, to move them—but no response.

Soon, Edward came and pulled me away.

And he opened his damn mouth:

"What is going on here, Mr. Nox? A man hanged himself, and three others—God knows what happened. Now tell me, how am I gonna stop these workers from leaving here, huh?"

"Well, Edward, call the sheriff. Let them deal with this shit. Because I’m out, and I don’t give a single fuck about what’s going or gonna be here."

He kept saying things, but I didn’t listen.

I walked toward the auto park and approached one of the fleeing workers.

Yeah, that’s right—everyone was fleeing.

"Mind giving me a ride to town, fella?"

"Sure, Priest. Get in."

I got inside the car. He put the keys in and turned it. Ignition clicked again and again.

Yeah. Car wasn’t starting.

He cursed and got out. I looked around.

It wasn’t just ours. Every fucking car wasn’t starting.

That moment, I realized—this thing they talked about?

It’s real.

I left the car and returned to Edward. Took him into one of the containers and yelled:

"Listen, Mr. Edward—call the sheriff immediately. There’s some serious shit going down out here."

"Oh, is that so, Mr. Nox? Well, let me give you a fucking surprise—phones are not working."

"What?"

"Yeah, you heard me damn right. Phones are dead. Cars are dead. We’re trapped here, Mr. Nox. And you’re the only one the people are looking at as their savior."

"Now either you're gonna fix this shit—or God knows what’s gonna happen to us."

At that moment? I didn’t know what to do.

But I’m a guy who knows things. You catch me?

Anyway, I left the container, and in front of me was a worker, holding a stick and drawing symbols into the dirt.

As I got closer, I saw them—four symbols.

Looked like a foreign alphabet. As soon as I saw them, I remembered a memory I don’t like to remember.

Well, if you’ve read this far, you know I’m not a real exorcist.

But I know a thing or two.

You might be wondering how.

Well, my friend—the one I mentioned—is a real exorcist. Unlike me.

I caught a few tricks from him.

At that point, I figured some things out. It was time to put in real work.

I walked toward the container I slept in last night. As I approached it—

It was already gone.

You’re gonna ask what I mean.

Well, it was covered in oil. Inside. Outside. Spewing everywhere.

As I got closer, I knew everything in there was either destroyed or soaked.

I didn’t take a step inside. Just looked around from where I stood, without touching anything.

Then I turned back—and saw the foreman coming toward me. He looked like he was about to piss himself, like everyone else.

"Mr. Nox, what we gonna do? We’re trapped here."

"Gather everyone near the lunch container. Everyone. No one should be alone."

"Okay."

He ran to gather everyone.

I walked over to the lunch container, slow and tired.

I grabbed my cigarette pack—three left. That made me sad. I lit one anyway.

I was feeling different. Because I was feeling the same way I did years ago,

when I encountered my first spirit. Demon. Devil. Whatever you wanna call it.

I know, I know—you thought I was a conman, right?

Well… you didn’t meet your Uncle Nox yet.

I entered a container near the lunch one and dropped my bag to the floor.

Opened it, grabbed a cross, and put it on my neck.

Took out a case of beer—I always keep three in my bag for emergencies.

Also a pack of smokes.

Oh—I also grabbed a book with a blank cover.

Then I left the cabin, holding my bag. Out front of the lunch container, everyone was there—or it looked like it.

I asked:

"How many people here, Mr. Jones?"

"Seventy-six. Excluding you and Mr. Edward."

"Okay. Did those three on the pump move?"

"No, Mr. Nox. What’s gonna happen to them?"

"Nothing. Don’t worry. When I deal with the spirit, they’ll be fixed."

"Alright. Now listen up, everyone. You all know me as Mr. Nox or Priest Nox. I exorcise curses, spirits, devils—whatever you need."

"Anyway, it’s been a while since I dealt with something this strong, so it’s gonna take some time. But there’s nothing to worry about."

"Since all of us have needs—like toilets, food, sleeping—I advise you to stay in large groups. Wear crosses if you have one. Do not touch anything weird or oily."

"Do not disturb me. Bring some coal if we have it. Also alcohol—anything will work. Get some wood if you can. That’s it."

"If anyone has questions, ask Mr. Jones or Mr. Edward. Mr. Edward, can we speak in a private container?"

He followed me. We entered a container—and without either of us touching it, the door slammed shut behind us.

Edward looked at me, scared.

I laughed, mocking him. Then he asked:

"How are you so calm, Mr. Nox?"

"Well, Mr. Edward, I did this many times. Don’t you worry."

"But I have some questions about things you’ve been hiding from me since the start. If you're honest, we can end this quickly. If you’re not..."

"There’s a chance that the next dead person will be you."
