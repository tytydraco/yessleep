I look around.

-Back in my old elementary school classroom.  

Everything looks exactly how I remember it. Small old wooden table hiding under the blanket of dust. Wankly, little chairs sitting under them. I can’t help but smile a little. Everything was easier when we were small.  

“Stupidity and ignorance must be a blessing.”  

I chuckle while swiping the dust from the small tables. “Monster, Weirdo, Bastard” were carved in one of them. My heart burns and my mind races.  

“It reminds me of something, but I can’t...” 

 It happens to me all the time. My memories are like Switzer cheese. I remember most of my life, but certain intervals in my memory lane are completely gone, cut out pieces, lost somewhere. That’s why I’m here in the first place. I want to find those pieces because whatever I do, I feel the pain of missing something, something important... 

 Forgetting...  

I don’t remember how I got here in the first place. Did I slip in through the window or did I ask for permission to enter? If it’s a school, why is the classroom so dusty like it hasn’t been used in years?  

**THUMP THUMP THUMP** 

Excruciating pain flows through my head. Needles stabbing though my brain trying to poison it.  

“Stop! Stop it now! Don’t do that to me!” 

“Hey, how are you keeping up?” 

A warm calm voice can be heard in the background. Suddenly, I feel the excruciating pressure in my brain melting away. I turn around. A beautiful woman with a kind smile stands in front of the teacher's desk. No words, my mouth goes dry. I’ve never seen such a picture of pure perfection in front of me. Her green flower dress accentuates her the emeralds in her eyes. Her smile shines like a warm summer wind. A true goddess was right in front of me. I froze, being more than overwhelmed by her warm-healing energy.  

“You seem better” 

I coughed a little bit in embarrassment, trying to regain control of myself and my mouth again.  

“I apologize. I had a light headache. I hope I didn’t intrude!”  

“Not yet”  

She smiles at me with hints of curiosity in her eyes. I hope she won’t ask how I got in an elementary school. I wouldn’t be able to answer her anyway...  

“Aren’t you a little too old for a fourth-grade art class?”  

“I-I apologies! I was a student at this school many years ago. This was my old classroom.”, I awkwardly stuttered, making her smile even more.  

“Was it always that dirty? I swear, those children always leave everything lying around and never clean even a little up. I still love my kids though.” She bends down, picking up a small red crafting scissor. Suddenly, the pressure in my head is building up again. I fall on the floor, holding my head in pain.  

“Why?!” 

As I open my eyes, I’m no longer in the classroom. I look down at two small bloody hands on a dirty stone ground.  

“Look! The monster’s crying!”- a voice squeaked above me.  

“I heard his mom cheated in his dad!”, said another.  

“My mom told me, he killed him!”  

I felt my nails digging in my palm. Anger boiling up inside of me. I look up at those evil grinning faces looking down at me.  

“That’s not true! Why are you so mean?!”, I screamed at them, tears rolling down my cheeks in frustration. Suddenly, one of the boys kicked me on my back, making me fall face first on the ground. I feel the metallic taste of blood flooding my mouth.  

“Shit, is he dead?” “Who cares? Let’s go back before anyone sees us!”  

“Wait. I want a souvenir!”  

Something pulls on my hair, forcing me to face one of the boys. He mischievously smiles at me, holding a red crafting scissor into my face. I look at him terrified.  

“Hurry up!”  

A snap-The evil scissor boy proudly holds a red curl of my hair in his hand.  

“Someone’s coming! Let’s go!”  

**THUMP THUMP THUMP**  

Sounds of little footsteps are fading. I feel my vision getting blurry. Still one thought is haunting my mind.  

- Why?  

I open my eyes, trying to adjust my vision to the cold light. After blinking a few times, I’m able to see more clearly. In front of me was a classroom. Even though the rooms seemed clean; it gave off a freezing cold. I keep looking around. The wooden tables and chairs seemed a little taller now. On the wall is a colorful poster. It’s the only thing that gives off some kind of warmth. I remember! - I created that poster in art class. My lips turn into a smile. It’s one of my happiest memories. My art teacher always encouraged me to draw how I feel. Lonely, I felt lonely. Everyone was afraid of me since nasty rumor spread about me killing my father. I didn’t want to be alone anymore. A warm hand reaching out to me, asking if I want to be their friend. My teacher was incredibly impressed by my work that they put my poster up for everyone to see. I felt special for once, in a good way. I keep walking around the cold room, shaking and freezing. My eyes scanning my old middle school classroom. My gaze catches a few written words on the blackboard.  

“Go kill yourself you monster!” 

Suddenly the pressure builds up again, piercing my brain. I hold my ears as excessive noises fill my ears. The overcoming pain is tremendous. Slowly the noises turn into many voices talking and screaming.  

I turn away from the blackboard looking around. The classroom is filled with my old middle school classmates. A terrible sense of deja-vu nags my senses. I’ve been here before. 

“What’s wrong? Is the little monster afraid?” 

In front of me is an older version of the scissor boy. He’s belittling me with his high, cocky smile. Something in his eyes tells me that he’s waiting for me to crumble.  

“I’m tired of your stupid shit. Can you just leave me alone?” 

“Never, not as long as a murderer sits in my classroom.” 

“Listen, I never killed my dad. He died in an accident! It’s not my fault!” 

“Keep lying to yourself. We know the truth.” 

“Should we help him, remember?”, said another voice. I don’t even care to look around for who it is. Always the same- Always the same voices and faces, I don’t want to be reminded of them. The smile plastered on the boy's face in front of me gets wider.  

“Sure, let’s help him out a little.” 

**THUMP THUMP THUMP** 

A warm liquid flows down my forehead, down my nose, reaching my lips. It’s the warm metallic taste again. I don’t like it, still I’m getting used to it. I open my eyes. Millimeters from my face I see the blackboard. The writing has been blurred. It flows down with the red. I don’t feel anything, no pain, no happiness, not even the warm red. Nothing... 

I wake up and find myself back in my old high school classroom.  

Why? What have I done to deserve this?! I want you to stop. Please... 

In frustration I sit down at a table in the back corner and start repeatedly hitting my head on the table. I cry in pure frustration. I don’t want it anymore. I can’t take it anymore. Just let my go. Suddenly I see a crumpled piece of paper next to my foot. I don’t know where it comes from. And I don’t care! 

Suddenly the excessive pressure builds up again. I smash my head repeatedly on the table until... there are voices again. 

**THUMP THUMP THUMP** 

“Hey, you’ve been called by the officer outside the door. Please pick up your stuff and follow him.” 

I look up to my old high school homeroom teacher. She bows down to my table touching my shoulder. Her eyes are red and tired but still seem worried. No wonder, I guess her alcoholic husband keeps on abusing her. Later she will get killed by him while being pregnant with his child. It’s none of my business anyways. 

“Come one, let’s not keep him waiting.” 

Tired I throw my stuff into my back, swing it over my shoulder and follow my teacher out my classrooms door. In the background I hear a boy screaming. 

“Arrest him officer! Before he kills even more!” 

In front of the door is a police officer with a wide stance and worried smile. He nods to my teacher while leading me away from the classroom. 

“What’s wrong?”, I ask tired. Actually, I don’t care anyway. I just want a reason to put up all that afford to move. 

“Not here, son. Let’s go to the station and I’ll explain it to you.” 

I stop in my tracks and look at him. 

“Yes here, give me a reason I must endure getting pulled out of class. I won’t move until you tell me.”, I demanded. The officer looks at me for a few seconds until he sighs. 

“Your mom, she has been...” 

Suddenly the excessive pressure starts building up in my head. I scream as the pain gets worse and worse. Tears falling down my cheeks. My whole body shakes until it crashes on the ground. 

I wake up and stare at a dirty old ceiling. Yeah, I remember this ugly place. Tired I raise myself up, looking around. On the other side of the room is an ugly, old, wooden bed. On there is my old college roommate making out with his girlfriend. 

**THUMP THUMP THUMP** 

Disgusting motherfuckers, I thought. It’s not the first time they decided to make out right next to me sleeping and for sure not the last. At some point I’ve thought, they’re doing it specifically because it’s their kink, but whatever...  

On the table in front of me lays a pair dirty tidy whities. Now, they were more yellow than white. It’s fucking disgusting. Why does he always throw his dirty underwear on my stuff. I hate it! Underneath there’s a red book. It takes me few seconds until I remember. Yes! That was the book I got from this cute girl. I pull out the book from underneath the dirty underwear, sit down and stare at the cover. 

“I want you to have it.”, a warm calm voice delights my ears. 

As I look up, I see a beautiful young woman with blond curly, emerald, green eyes and a shining smile. My heart fills up with something warm. It feels really nice. 

“But why?”, I stuttered in embarrassment. She was the most beautiful woman, I’ve ever seen. 

“You helped me a lot to pass my assignment and I wanted to thank you.” 

“T-Thank you!” 

“No need to thank me for anything! I should thank you!” 

She placed a kiss on my cheek, smiled that beautiful smile of hers and walks down the hallway. I feel the red rising up my cheeks. What’s happening?! I feel warm, a little too warm. Embarrassed I hold the book in front of my face, hoping she doesn’t see look back and see me like this. I don’t care what the others thought. But somehow, I did what she thought about me. She’s doing weird things to me but... I kinda like it. 

I place the book back down on the table. As I look around, I’m back in the elementary school room. But something has changed... It looks different. There are posters on the walls, the small tables look more modern, and the light shines warmer. As I look around in the room, I hear a warm calm voice. 

“Hey, how are you keeping up? You seem better” 

I coughed a little bit in embarrassment, trying to regain control of myself and my mouth again.  

“I apologize. I had a light headache last time. I didn’t want to intrude!” 

“Not worries! It’s the end of the day and my students are gone. What are you doing here?” 

“I wanted to apologies for last time. I didn’t know what took over me...” 

“It’s a beautiful sunny day, I’ll forgive you if the ice cream is on you.”, she smiles at me while the sun shines on her. He golden hair and emerald, green eyes reflect the sunlight. She’s the most beautiful treasure ever seen. Love fills my heart by the sight of her. I nod and hold my hand out for her to take it. As she places her hand in mine everything erupts. 

The classroom is a cliff, and her face looks afraid, red and swollen from tears while the rain drips upon us. In a shaking voice she begs. 

“Please, don’t do this to me! I know this isn’t you!” 

I let go of her hand in shock. What is this?! What have I done?! Why are we here?! I have no time to think about it as her face distorts in a devilish smile. Her hands turn into sharp scissors and in a grotesque manner she walks threatening towards me. 

“What’s wrong? Is the little monster afraid?”, it spits out in a creepy childish voice. 

“Of you?! Not anymore!”, I screamed at it. Tired of being always pushed around and abused, I stand my ground and face it. Whatever comes, will come. 

“Keep lying to yourself. We know the truth.” 

“You don’t know shit! Leave me alone! I want you out of my life. Let me be happy, just for once!” 

“Go kill yourself you monster!”  

“No, because I will kill you first!”, I collect all my strength, clutch my fists and runs towards that devilish creature. It keeps on smiling at me. Right before I’m able to punch it into its guts I hear a begging female voice.  

“Babe, please...” 

It tries to trick me again. That’s not my wife, that’s the devil toying with me. As he has done all my life. Now I know it’s him and I won’t fall for his manipulation. 

“Why?”, I hear the creature cry out before I push it off the cliff into the foggy darkness... 

I’ve done it. It’s finally other. I faced my demons. Now I’m finally free. 

I feel the excruciating pain inside my brain again. A pressure that needs to be released. I open my eyes, nose, mouth and ears and let all the pressure out. The warmth flows through my every hole out. As close my eyes and take in a deep breath, I feel the cold returning to me. That the familiar cold I welcomed in my body for years. It’s finally back. Suddenly I hear a metallic, loud voice all around me.  

“Test #6241 positive, Subject returned”
