I’ve never been good at making decisions. Some days, even a lunch order can trigger a panic attack. Should I get a sandwich? Or would a pizza be better? Maybe tacos? Do I get it delivered, or eat it there? So many choices. Too many.

Luckily, Mom was always there to make the tough calls for me. Thanks to her, I got an office job with benefits. My personal life was free from drama. We lived together in a nice apartment. It was a quiet life, but a good one. A safe one.

Until I came home from work and found her dead in the living room.

The doctors said she suffered from a pulmonary embolism. They assured me there was nothing I could’ve done, even if I was there. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling I’d failed her. Dad died when I was young, I don’t have any siblings, and the rest of our family is estranged. I was her special little boy. The only person she had left in the entire world. And I let her die alone.

Even with that guilt hanging over my head, the first few weeks were easier than expected. She left arrangements for the funeral, and I buried myself in ensuring they went perfectly. But after her body was lowered into the earth, things went south fast. 

Every decision became life or death. Shave my beard, or let it grow? Do the laundry, or wait a couple days? Sweep? Mop? Dust? All the little things I took for granted piled up so high I couldn’t bear the weight of them anymore. It got so bad I called off work, if only to reduce the number of choices in my day.

For a whole week I sat in the apartment we used to share, staring at the walls and nibbling on the stale snacks left over in my pantry. I didn’t leave my room unless my bodily functions demanded it. Then the morning finally came when I crawled out to forage for food and there was none left.

I stared into the empty pantry as the reality of my situation washed over me. I was out of food. I needed to get more. Did I have enough money? Of course I did, Mom left me everything she had. But what was my budget? She always took care of that kind of thing. And even if that got sorted out, where should I go? What should I get? The usual? Something to cheer me up? Enough for a week? For a day?

“Oh dear, what a state you’re in. Perhaps you should take a shower.”

The words snapped me out of my reverie. I looked around, but no one else was in the apartment. I even checked the deadbolt just to be sure. Once I was sure I was alone, I forced a laugh. What I’d perceived as a voice was an errant thought. Nothing more.

In hindsight I should’ve questioned why my internal monologue had a woman’s voice. But I wasn’t in the most stable frame of mind, and I did need to clean up. So I trudged to the bathroom and forced myself to take a shower. The water was refreshing, and the act of cleaning made me feel like a person instead of a husk.

Once I finished scrubbing myself, I got dressed and decided to go on a grocery run. Everything went well until I grabbed the knob to leave. As my hands touched the cold brass, a thought occurred to me. I knew how to get to the grocery store, of course. But it was a weekend afternoon. There’d be a lot of people there. Did I still smell? Did I look okay? Would everyone sense something was wrong with me? What if I embarrassed myself, or broke down in the middle of the aisle? 

Logically, I knew none of that mattered. I was hungry. I needed food. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t make myself turn the knob. Visions of disgusted grocery clerks swam before my eyes. I couldn’t face that. Wouldn’t.

“What are you waiting for? No sense in dilly-dallying.”

I jumped. It was the same voice as before, but this time I knew it wasn’t in my head. I demanded to know who was there.

“Here, poppet. On the table.”

I turned to my kitchen table and saw a brown cricket staring at me. It was a bit small, but otherwise indistinct. I wasn’t sure how it had gotten in. I’d shut the windows, right? Was there more than one? Did I need to call an exterminator? I was sure Mom would’ve called the exterminator. Did she have one she preferred? God, there was so much she hadn’t told me.

“Please quit staring. It’s very rude,” the cricket said. Its mandibles twitched in time to the words.

I expressed my amazement with an expletive.

“Hmph!” the cricket snorted. “There’s no need for *that* sort of language!”

I apologized and explained I’d never seen a talking cricket before.

“Oh, no offense taken,” it chuckled. “Normally I’d keep my mouth shut tight, but… I’ve been watching you. You seem like a nice young man, but you clearly need a little extra help. Why don’t I move in for a bit? I won’t need much, just some food and space to roam.”

Even in the lowest depths of my depression, I was hesitant to accept its offer. The cricket seemed sensible enough, but a talking bug is still a bug.

“Oh, silly me. Here I am asking you to make a big decision on an empty stomach. Run to the grocery and stock up for a week. Don’t worry, you’ll be just fine. Off you go!”

I hesitated for a moment, then turned the doorknob and left for the grocery store. The trip was uneventful. I was worried the clerk would comment on how much I was buying, but he didn’t say anything. When I returned home, the cricket heralded my arrival with a cheerful chirp.

“Well done! See? Not hard at all, right?”

I conceded the cricket was right and that I felt much better. It chirped again and hopped closer. Without thinking, I held out my hand and it hopped into my palm.

“So? Can I stay?”

After a few moments’ consideration, I said yes.

“Excellent! Just listen to my advice, poppet, and everything will be right as rain in no time. You’ll see.”

So began the cricket’s role as my roommate, conscience, and advisor. It was a simple routine. Every night after I ate dinner, I took the leftovers into Mom’s bedroom, where the cricket had insisted on staying. Most days I didn’t see it because the room was so big, but it always greeted me with a friendly hello. Once I got the meal settled, it would play me a soft, calming tune and ask me about my day. It patiently listened to what I said, then gave me advice about whatever problem I was facing. It was very smart, just like Mom was. It always knew just what to do. All it asked in return was that I shut the bedroom door when I wasn’t talking to it. I was happy to oblige. Our routine was comforting, and we were happy together.

For a while.

The rifts began when one of my coworkers asked me how long I’d been in my position. I realized I’d had the same job for five years. I liked my team, don’t get me wrong. But the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea of moving up in the company.

I poked around on our internal job board and found a position which seemed perfect for me. Same building, better hours, and almost double the pay. My coworkers encouraged me to apply, but I wasn’t sure. That night, I asked the cricket if it thought I should go for it.

“Absolutely not! Take it from a lowly cricket. There’s nothing wrong with staying at the bottom of the food chain.”

Normally I wouldn’t have questioned its judgment, but something about its tone felt off. It wasn’t gentle like usual. There was a harsh edge to it, almost angry. I decided to push the issue by admitting I was getting bored with my current work.

“Oh, come now, poppet. You already have everything you could possibly need. And what about your friends, hmm? You don’t want to abandon them, do you?”

I admitted it had a point.

“Glad you think so! Stay right where you are. No need to rock the boat.”

I promised I wouldn’t apply for the job, and the cricket was so pleased it played my favorite melody. But no matter how much I thought it over, I couldn’t help but feel like its advice was wrong. Figuring I had nothing to lose, I submitted my resume the next day.

For three weeks I waited, unsure if I’d made the right call. My heart skipped a bit when I got the email asking if I had time for an interview. Talking to a stranger who had control over my future career frightened me, but I agreed to set some time aside for a meeting. I thought about asking the cricket for advice, but I was worried it would get agitated again so I didn’t. I was on my own.

The interview felt like it lasted three hours. Every question felt like a trick, even the ones I knew the answers to. I did my best to look my interviewer in the eye, but she kept staring down at her notepad. When it was over, she looked over her notes and said she’d be in touch. I knew I’d failed.

But I must’ve done something right, because soon after she called back to offer me the job. I had no clue how I’d pulled it off, but I accepted immediately.

When I got home that night I prepared some steaks to celebrate. The cricket buzzed in anticipation as I set down its meal.

“My my, this is a surprise! What’s the occasion?”

I wanted to lie. But I’d never lied to the cricket before, so I swallowed the urge and told it the good news. 

It was silent for a long time.

“I don’t understand. I thought we agreed you didn’t want that.”

I apologized and explained that I couldn’t help myself. 

It didn’t answer.

I shifted from foot to foot and looked around the room. I could feel it staring at me, but I couldn’t figure out where it was. That had never bothered me before. I wondered if maybe it should have. I suddenly realized I hadn’t actually *seen* my companion for a month.

“Hmph,” if finally tutted. “Well. You’re very lucky, poppet. Still, I cannot condone such headstrong behavior. Promise me you won’t do anything that reckless again.”

I promised.

“Right. Good night, then.”

Its tone was final. Reluctantly, I turned to leave. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, so I asked why I hadn’t seen it in so long.

“Oh, that. I’m a bug, dear. I prefer the dark. That’s all.”

I promised I’d buy some blackout shades for it. 

“Thank you.”

I waited for it to speak again, but it said nothing. I shut the door and left it to sulk.

The next day, I bought and installed the shades, as promised. This pleased the cricket, but things changed between us. There was a new tone to her advice that I didn’t like. Her words were sharper, more pointed. More than once I thought I caught a hidden insult. I tried to appease it with its favorite foods, but nothing worked. It was determined to stay mad at me.

As my home life deteriorated, life at work became better than ever. I was reassigned to a bigger desk, and I still had time to talk with my old team members if I wanted. The work was an exciting new challenge, and I found I liked it much more than my previous job. My old team commented that I looked happier. If not for the cricket waiting for me at home, I would’ve agreed.

With my new desk came new neighbors. They were nice enough, but the only one who stood out was a woman who kept glancing at me as I worked. I didn’t think much of it until the day she walked over to my desk and gestured at the Y-wing model I had placed as a decoration.

“I’ve been meaning to tell you, I love your *Enterprise*! *Stargate* is my favorite.”

The comment threw me. Was she joking? The kit was clearly from *Star Wars*. But she’d made two mistakes. And *Stargate* was a deep cut. So it was probably a joke. I was never good with jokes. She seemed nice. And even if she wasn’t I didn’t want to come off as stuffy. Did I look okay? I couldn’t remember. It became very important that I remembered.

I must have made a face or something, because she laughed.

“Relax, I’m just kidding. I’m Courtney.”

She offered her hand and smiled. I smiled back and shook. We held the handshake for a moment too long. She didn’t seem to mind.

That night, I told the cricket about what happened. When I got to the handshake it beat its wings angrily, cutting me off.

“Now listen here!” it buzzed, its words made harsher by the sound of its wings. “It’s always nice to make new friends, but get that dopey look off your face! You *must* keep things professional! Office relationships never work out, and you’ve been taking *far* too many risks lately!”

I wanted to argue, but as always, it had a point. I reluctantly agreed to keep things platonic. The buzzing died down, and the cricket sighed.

“Oh, dear. I’m afraid I must sound like such a nag, poppet. But it’s like you’ve been going out of your way to paint a target on your back. And things have been so awkward between us lately. Don’t you know I just want what’s best for you? That all I want is to keep you safe?”

The comment cut deep. I apologized and swore I’d make an effort to patch things up. And I honestly intended to. I really did. 

But life’s never that easy. As the weeks went on, Courtney and I kept talking. It started off small. Science fiction we liked, games we’d been meaning to play, Metal Gear memes, that kind of thing. The more we talked, the more serious our conversations got. Before long, the best part of coming into work was getting to see her. She made everything feel easy. I didn’t stress as much when she was around. The only thing I couldn’t talk to her about was the cricket.

That was unfortunate, because the cricket was getting worse. It wanted less light, more food, more attention. I did my best to indulge it, but our conversations kept leading back to Courtney. That made the cricket angry, which only made things worse. Our conversations dwindled, and I heard it hopping around in its room and muttering to itself at all hours of the night. I spent more time away from home than usual.

Things came to a head one night when Courtney and I hit a lull in our work. She shot me a look she’d never given me before. Nervous, but hopeful.

“Hey… are you doing anything tonight?”

I told her I was thinking about spending a night in. The cricket had been particularly brisk with me the night before, and I wanted to spend some extra time with it as an apology.

“Oh. Okay…”

Courtney slumped into her chair and sighed. Something told me to ask if she had something in mind. The question made her blush.

“Well, it’s nothing big, but… do you want to get dinner after work? There’s this Italian place I’ve been meaning to try, but I hate going to restaurants alone…”

I’m not good with women, but I’m not dumb. I’ll spare you the sappy details, but by the end of the night we agreed to give dating a shot. I couldn’t believe it. I was almost delirious with happiness.

The feeling faded the moment I got home. I cursed when I saw the time. It was almost midnight. The cricket must’ve been starving. 

I threw together a plate and entered its room. Instead of the usual greeting, I was met with silence. I stopped in the doorway and called out to let it know I was back. It didn’t answer. 

That’s when I noticed something in the corner of the room that wasn’t there before. I hesitated for a second, then warned the cricket I was turning on the lights. I took the lack of reply as acceptance and flipped the switch.

In the corner of the room sat the remnants of a molted exoskeleton. It was gigantic, six feet long at least. I gagged and looked away, only to find multiple half-eaten shells littering the floor. Horror coursed through me. How big had this thing gotten…?

Somehow my lizard brain recovered enough to form a coherent thought. *Get out. NOW.*

I slowly turned around and walked to my front door. The cricket… if it could still be called that… dropped from above, blocking my way out. It reared to its full height and clicked its mandibles. Its head nearly touched the ceiling.

“You’re late,” it hissed.

I recoiled in disgust. The proportions were all wrong. Its abdomen was too short, its thorax was too long, its legs were all different sizes. I looked away, trying to keep it at the edge of my vision.

“Look at me when I’m talking to you!”

I forced myself to look at its face. The eyes had shifted forward, but hadn’t lost their insectoid quality. A fleshy bump approximating a nose sat awkwardly in the center of its face. Worst of all, hundreds of stringy, hairlike antennae on its scalp twitched in every direction. It was the same color as Mom’s hair. My hair. Just looking at it made me feel like bugs were crawling over my skin.

Somehow I managed to look it in the eye. I explained I was on a date.

“Let me guess. That Courtney girl…?”

Yes.

“I told you not to get too close to her.”

She makes me happy.

“Oh, please. You’re too sensitive for dating. You should end it before she hurts you.”

We’ve already made plans for a second date.

“She’ll never accept us. She’ll abandon you the moment she meets me.”

She’s never meeting you. We’re done.

“You’re not thinking clearly, poppet. Let me play you a song. For your nerves.”

The cricket played something on its back legs. The mutations warped the melody, shifting it into a screeching mess. I covered my ears and winced.

“What’s wrong? You don’t like my music anymore? You don’t like *me* anymore? After all I’ve done for you?”

It reached out and stroked my face. Disgusted, I shoved its hand away. It screeched and slapped me, sending me sprawling to the floor.

“Look at what you’ve done, you horrible boy! I don’t want to hit you. But bratty children require correction.”

It kicked me in the ribs so hard I gasped for breath. My vision shifted in and out of focus. I’d dropped the cricket’s dinner in the confusion, and the plate had shattered on the floor. I stared at one of the shards to anchor myself to consciousness.

“Do you feel like listening now, poppet?”

I nodded without thinking and realized I was crying. The cricket sighed and stroked my hair. Its touch disgusted me, but I didn’t fight it.

“Shh. Good boy. Good boy…”

I slowly reached for the plate shard. It was difficult to judge where it was through the tears.

“I’d hoped we’d have a little more time together, but you’ve become incorrigible. There’s only one way to protect you now.”

Above me, the cricket’s jaws clicked in anticipation. Hot drool dripped onto my back as one of its legs pinned me to the ground.

“Shh… stay still. Everything will be fine, puppet. I’ll take care of you.”

Its jaws gnashed together as it tilted my head, exposing my neck. My fingers caught the plate shard and closed around it. I felt the cricket’s hot breath on my skin as the gnashing got louder… louder…

I screamed and jabbed the shard into its face as hard as I could. It screeched in agony as its exoskeleton crumpled under the blow. I didn’t look back as I threw it off of me and fled the apartment.

“You ungrateful, spoiled boy!” it wailed, its voice a distorted moan. “You’ll never make it on your own! Come back! Come back!!!”

That was three days ago. I’ve been staying at Courtney’s. She’s been nice enough not to ask me about it, but she’s starting to worry about why I haven’t left the apartment. I can tell it’s eating at her. It’s only a matter of time before she confronts me.

I don’t know what to do. Maybe that *thing* is dead. Maybe it’s still alive, nursing its wounds. I’m too scared to check. Every day that passes gives it more time to recover. Should I make sure it’s dead? Is it possible to kill something like that? What do I do if it’s still alive? Or if it’s not there? What if it comes after me? What if it comes after Courtney?

Mom used to say writing things down helped her process them. Nobody knows about this account, so I figured it couldn’t hurt. If nothing else, maybe somebody can give me advice. Or a plan. Sympathy. Anything. Tell me what to do. Please. 

Last night I heard a cricket outside the window.
