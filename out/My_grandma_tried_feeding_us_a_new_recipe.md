My grandma lives up on the side a mountain. Her house wasn’t lonely of course but the closest house was at least a few hundred feet away and because nobody really lived with her since my grandpa passed away due to unknown reasons, we decided to spend three days with her. Me and my parents lived out in North Carolina while my grandma lived all the way in Arizona. So she was pretty lonely.

It took us around three and a half days to get there. It would usually take around one day and a half but we took multiple stops including sleeping at hotels. Once we arrive, my grandma comes out and gives us a kiss on the cheek and a hug.

“Oh my sweet lil’, Shaq’s” she called us. (She’s referencing to Shaq O’Neal because of how we were a really tall family)

She invites us in and my sister and I sat on the couch chilling on our phones. My parents went to the kitchen to help grandma clean. I felt bad because of how me and my sister were on the couch doing nothing while our parents were helping grandma clean. So, I got up and went to the kitchen while my sister still was on the couch doing absolutely nothing.

“Here, hand me the broom, please,” I ask my dad.

As I take the broom, my dad stares at me with a surprised face like he never seen me help around before. My dad then walks out the kitchen and from there, I could hear the couch springs groan as my dad plopped onto the couch. I was sweeping under the table and then my mom points to the fridge.

“Sweep behind the fridge please, hun. Something smells real bad there!” my mom tasks.

I walked over to the fridge and could smell the stench from even a couple feet away. I looked what’s behind there and nearly threw up to what I just saw.

What I saw was a huge clump of chunky flesh. It was on top of a puddle of body fluids and blood. Flies flew around it as of what you would see to something that smelt horrendous.

“Grandma…” I stuttered before I gagged.

“What the hell is this…” I said with a trembling voice.

Grandma walked over to the fridge and looked at the mutilated pile.

“Oh, that’s just the meat from the fridge,” Grandma chuckled.

“Doesn’t it seem a bit too big, red and hard to be animal’s meat?” I stuttered.

“Ah! So what are you saying?! You saying I’m some cannibal?” Grandma scolded.

“No, ma…” I gagged.

I continued sweeping the floor and even swept the chunky pile of flesh into a container and then threw the container into the trash.

“I think you need a rest,” Grandma insisted.

I put down the broom on the wall and walked over to the couch. As I sat down, my sister looked at my horrified face and asked me a question.

“Ah, let me guess, you saw something disgusting while cleaning?”

I looked at my sister and nodded my head.

Time has now passed and I tucked myself to bed. My parents came in the room to give me and my sister a goodnight kiss. We did our nightly prayer and they left the room, turning off the lights on their way out. In just a few minutes I fell asleep.

Right after having an odd dream, I suddenly woke up around 1:23 to pans clanking from the kitchen. I got up from bed and opened the door very slowly. Once it makes a small creak, the sound from the kitchen stops. Whoever was in the kitchen heard that and was listening for anybody coming. I stood still and didn’t make a sound. A few seconds later the sound comes back but this time, it sounded like snapping and smashing with the sound of splatter.

I continued making my way to the kitchen and once I nearly exited the hallway, I heard whoever was in the kitchen begin to walk. Thinking fast, I run into the room on the other side of the hallway. I slightly opened the door and peeked through it and who I saw was my grandma. She walked out the house through the front door. Once she was outside, I quietly ran to the kitchen. I started looking for the source of the sound and once I looked behind me, I saw a bunch of blood splattered on the wall behind the fridge. I ran to the fridge and saw blood leaking out from under the fridge door. I prepared myself to look inside and once I opened the fridge door, I saw something that was even worse than yesterday.

I saw a human torso with all limbs severed except the head. The torso was cut open and hollowed out. Around the torso are to-go foam containers soaked with blood. One was labeled, “minced right arm” and another was labeled “dissected heart.”

Surprisingly, the head attached to the hollowed torso looks up at me and speaks faintly.

“She’s… trying… to feed… you…” the mutilated man said before dropping his head dying.

I felt even worse knowing that this was done while the man was alive. I carried the container labeled, “sliced lung” and ran up to my parents.

I woke them up and showed them what was inside the container. Next thing I remembered, I was waiting in the car with my mom and sister. After waiting I saw my dad coming out the house sobbing with a gun in his hand and with blood on his white tank top. He closed the trunk door after putting our stuff inside. He then walks into the car and starts it.

We drove home silent that night. Dad never answered whenever we asked if grandma was going to be okay. He just stared at the road in front of us and kept driving without stopping.
