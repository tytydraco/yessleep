I don’t know how much longer I can hold on. Greg died yesterday. Sarah panicked and was eaten this morning. And Joe… oh God… Joe couldn’t take it anymore. He walked right out into the open, staring the Beast in the eye as if daring it to end him. I wanted to stop him—I really did—but there was nothing I could do. One second he was there, shaking, screaming, and the next… nothing. Just silence.

The hall smells like rust and meat. My boots crunch over shattered glass and feathers torn from who-knows-what. My hands won’t stop shaking long enough to reload. The radio on my vest crackles every few minutes with static, like someone’s trying to talk but keeps cutting out. Every time I reach for it, the noise dies.

They told us everything was secure. Fences, alarms, containment systems—they said it was impossible for anything to escape. But they lied. Something went wrong overnight. I don’t know exactly what, and I don’t know if anyone will ever admit it, but the Beast got out. The smaller predators followed, tearing through the staff who weren’t fast enough. And then the Pteranodons… I don’t even know how they got out. One moment they were in their aviary; the next, they were flying over the park, wings beating the air like storm clouds. Shadows swept over buildings. Their screeches cut through the dark like jagged knives. They swooped down, snatching people from the grounds. Workers, maintenance crews, anyone outside—they didn’t stand a chance. I saw one grab a man as he tried to crawl into a supply shed; the man screamed, then vanished into the sky. I couldn’t stop looking. I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t look away.

Power failed. Fences collapsed. Alarms kept screaming. Everything that was supposed to keep us safe became useless overnight. The whole park went dark, and chaos spread faster than anyone could react.

I keep my head low. The predators have been gone from this section for a while, or maybe they’re just hiding, waiting. I can hear claws scraping metal somewhere in the vents, or maybe that’s just the pipes. I don’t know anymore. My eyes are burning from lack of sleep.

There’s blood on the walls. Some of it’s human. Some of it’s… not. A kid’s stuffed animal lies in the corner, soaked and half-shredded. I don’t stop to look at it. I can’t.

They said a helicopter was coming to rescue survivors. “Any survivors head to the helipad.” That’s what the radio said. But I don’t believe it. They don’t care about us. We’re disposable. We’ve been disposable from day one. The entire facility is disposable.

I’m writing this as I walk, my rifle slung uselessly over my shoulder. The door ahead is jammed, and I’m too tired to panic about the noise I’m making as I force it open. Something growls in the dark behind me. I push harder. The door gives way.

I can hear a boat horn far off. Maybe there really is a way out. Maybe there isn’t. My compass says I’m heading north, but the helipad’s supposed to be south. I’ll have to turn around. If I turn around, the Beast will see me.

The dinosaurs have taken over the island. Every fence, every gate, everything—gone. Shadows of wings still pass overhead. The island belongs to them now.

I’m heading towards the helipad. If you find this notebook and not me, there are weapons in the basement. I’m probably dead. If you do make it off the island, give my family my dog tags.
