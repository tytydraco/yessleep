"Your card is the seven of diamonds!"

I looked up in bewilderment and flipped my seven of diamonds onto the couch beside me.

My wife stood and started clapping. My brother Brian, still nursing the same Modelo he'd been working on for an hour, let out a "God damn" that earned an immediate scowl from Maria. Our son James was eight, and she was determined to keep profanity out of his vocabulary for as long as humanly possible.

"How'd you do it?" I asked, tousling James's long brown hair as he scooped up my card and jammed it back into the shuffled pile on the carpet.

He flashed me a gap-toothed grin—the tooth fairy had visited recently. "A true magician never reveals his secrets."

Brian heaved himself up, shaking his head. "I don't know how you pulled that off, kid, but that was damn impressive." He dropped to one knee, waiting for James to look up from his cards. "Here's another trick for you. Say who your favorite uncle is, and I bet you can make a dollar appear."

James turned to me with barely contained glee. "Uncle Brian!"

Maria snorted a laugh.

"That's right!" Brian fished a dollar from his wallet and placed it on James's card pile. James snatched it up, holding it overhead like he'd won the last golden ticket to Wonka's factory. Brian stood, drained his beer, and pulled Maria into a brief hug. "I should head out. Thanks for having me."

Maria's eyes found mine over Brian's shoulder, eyebrows raised sharply. *Do something.*

"Bri, you know we've got a spare room if you want to crash and drive home tomorrow."

He waved me off. "Appreciate it, Jacob, but it's been a few hours. Mostly out of my system."

Maria and I walked him to the door, lingering on the porch as he climbed into his truck. We waved through his farewell honks, staying until his taillights disappeared down the street.

Inside, James was still on the carpet, arranging cards into elaborate patterns.

"All right, mister. Bedtime." Maria had already let him stay up thirty minutes past his usual.

“Wait, wait, one more trick, I promise this one’s fast.” James pleaded, Maria’s eyes looking to mine for reinforcements. “Okay, Dad, think of a card.”

“Uhh, ok, got it. Do I say it or?” 

“No,” James responded quickly.

“Can I at least tell your mom?” I teased, looking towards Maria. James grabbed a card from his pile and looked at it. He then slowly held up the card to his ear, like you would for a cellphone. After a few seconds, he let it fall to the floor. "You can tell her. But whisper." He giggled, clamping his hands over his ears and squeezing his eyes shut.

My wife and I met in the middle of the living room. “Six of spades,” I whispered. Maria nodded her head in approval.

“All done?” James hollered out, his hands still glued to the side of his head and his eyes closed tight. 

“YES!” I shouted. 

His tongue poked through the gap in his teeth as he dropped his hands and opened his eyes. "Okay, let me find your card."

He began flipping through the pile, slowly at first, then faster, holding some close to his face before discarding them. After going through most of them, he mumbled, “I think your card ran away,” with a slight frown. His face turned quickly, eyes lighting up. “It's more comfy in your pocket, your left pocket!” He exclaimed, pointing to my right pocket, his left, I suppose.

My hand met his gaze, and I patted the side of my pocket. There was something in there. My laidback smile twisted into genuine curiosity. I reached it and felt the glossy thickness of a playing card. 

I pulled it out.

“Six of spades,” I muttered, shooting a glance at my wife, who seemed equally puzzled. 

"Was that your card?" James was on his feet now, bouncing.

“Yeah..” I said, my voice lacked conviction. I tried to search for an answer in my wife’s eyes, but they were as ignorant as mine. 

“Okay, honey. Time for bed,” Maria seized control and led James towards the stairs by the hand.

He yawned, acquiescing to her command before standing rigid at the first step. “Wait, let me grab my cards!” He moaned. 

“James, time for bed, your dad will clean them up for you.” 

James’s face went crimson. His eyes, the angriest I’ve ever seen. He yanked his hand away from hers.

"James!" Maria's voice was sharp. "I raised you better than this."

I stood still in a state of shock, my mind trying to figure out how my son planted the card in my pocket. James’s innocence rushed back into his eyes, a remorseful facade etched across his face.

“Sorry, mom,” he replied meekly, “just those cards are special. Really special. Dad, can you put them in my room?”

I nodded, breaking out of my trance momentarily. “Sure, bud. Now go brush your teeth and go to bed.” I heard him let out a yawn as he and Maria tiptoed up the stairs. 

I bent down and gathered the cards. They felt normal, maybe a little heavier than other decks, but I couldn’t wrap my head around the trick.

Really, any of them for the matter. 

James had correctly guessed my card seven straight times, Brian’s three times, and Maria’s twice. 

I hadn't thought much of it at the time. James was only eight, and he couldn't even shuffle properly yet. I'd assumed he was just forcing the cards somehow, and we were all playing along the way you do with kids.

But the last trick was different. That was real, and there was something about it I didn’t like. 

Maria was brushing her teeth when I got up to our bedroom.

“You almost had me, you know,” she spat toothpaste into the sink, “How long were you guys planning that last trick?”

I swallowed hard, “What?”

“The trick, the one with the pocket.” She smiled at me in the mirror.

"Babe..." I glanced at our closed door and lowered my voice. "I had nothing to do with that. I genuinely don't know how James did it."

Maria rolled her eyes. She leaned in close, planting her two hands on my cheek. “Okay, honey,” she planted a minty kiss on my lips. “Go tuck in, James, and bring those cards; he was pretty adamant he wanted them back in his room.”

The hallway felt darker, more ominous as I crept over to James’s room. I gave a subtle knock before eeking his door open.

“Hey buddy,” I whispered, strolling over and sitting on the lip of his bed. “Good night.”

“Do you have my cards?” James’s voice was small in the darkness.

“Uhh-huh,” I confirmed.

“Can you put it on my desk, please?” I held the cards in my hand. My head was playing tricks; they felt hot. 

I set the cards on the desk and went to kiss James good night on his forehead. I had to know.

“Hey, buddy? How did you do that last trick?”

“Dad,” he mumbled, the sleep starting to catch up to him, “a magician never re-”

“I know, I know, buddy, but we’re best friends, right? You can tell me.” He sat up slightly. Moonlight from the window cut his face in half: one side bright, one side shadow. He glanced at the window, then back at me, and leaned closer.

“Promise not to tell mom?”

I leaned in too. “Of course, just you and me.” I crisscrossed my heart.

His voice dropped to barely a whisper.
