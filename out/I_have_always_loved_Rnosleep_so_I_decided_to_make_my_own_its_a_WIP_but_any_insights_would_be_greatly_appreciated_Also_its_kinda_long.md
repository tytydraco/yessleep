  
"I reside on the outskirts of a city in the desolate expanse of northern Alaska. While the setting appears calming with its pleasant surroundings, a dense forest looms on the edge of the city. To the north of the forest, a range of mountains lies high above the city and Like clockwork, every morning at 7 am and every night at 10 pm, ominous black vans with windows tinted like obsidian emerge from the depths of the forest. Despite numerous attempts from the inhabitants and the goal of tracing their destination through the twisting labyrinth of trees, their pursuit is cut short. The secretive convoy leads them to a security checkpoint that lies at the foot of the mountain, where they are promptly caught and forcibly escorted back to the edge of the city. The mystery of the caravan looms over our community, shrouded in an undermining feeling of darkness.

   
"From as early as I was a child, it became a tradition to await the arrival of the vans. Today was no different, but the usual routine was a little bit lonely as I found myself waiting for them in solitude. My twin sister, Iris, was in her bed sick with something...as my mom prepared her some medication, as a single mother, she had to prioritize caring for Iris over her work at the hospital. The silence was a chance to reflect on the memories that defined my childhood. My father left us when iris and I had just turned three, he could not stand not being able to go out and have anymore and did not want to spend the next few years of his life caring for us, so one night he packed up all his belongings and left.  


The hospital where my mom works sits conveniently close to my school, allowing her to shuttle us back and forth. However, today it looked like I had to take the bus instead. As I made my way to the bus stop, a sudden realization settled in—it was 7:02, and the vans that usually disrupted the morning air with their roaring engines were absent. An unsettling quietness enveloped the surroundings, in a somewhat calming change from the familiar soundscapes of our Alaskan mornings. Seated on the cold bench, I awaited the arrival of the bus, the chill in the air seeming more biting than usual, casting a felling of uncertainty  
Once the bus arrived, I got on and found an empty seat. I was not popular and only had a few friends, but that was fine with me, and as the bus came to life and drove away my eyes widened to see countless military trucks loaded with soldiers armed to the teeth in heavy weaponry. I started blankly at the trucks loaded with missiles, there had to be at least 6 of them. My mind raced to all kinds of different theories about what a party of military trucks was doing out here and heading towards the mountains but as soon as they appeared they faded into the dense forest, and it seemed as if I was the only one who had noticed it.  

  
Upon our arrival at school, I had already forgotten about the events at the bus stop. I got off the bus and I spotted Levi, one of my friends. I walked over to him, and we made our way to first period and settled into our seats. The classroom hushed as our teacher, Ms. Everly, broke the silence with a low, quiet tone. 'All right, class, sit down and take out a pencil for our test today. Remember, no talking, no cheating, and no notes. You may begin.  
I glanced down at my paper and started scribbling answers. I had always hated math for my entire life but going into 11th grade didn’t make it any easier   
I put down my pencil next to my completed paper, a sense of satisfaction washing over me. Deciding to take a break, I turned in my paper and requested to go to the bathroom. Leaving the classroom, I strolled through the halls, relaxing until the class was over. Pausing by a window, my attention was drawn to black smoke rising from the point where the mountain's foot met the forest. Just looking at it made me feel weird and my stomach dropped. I turned around and began jogging back to class. My brisk pace turned into a full sprint when the principal's voice crackled through the intercom.  


Attention students and staff, please remain calm. This is not a drill.” I stopped Inside the classroom. Everyone collectively looked towards our teacher, mirroring the same sense of confusion and uncertainty as her. The principal's voice returned, urgent and distressed, 'Teachers, please initiate the standard active shooter protocol and do not leave your classrooms until further instructions.' The words hung heavily in the air, as a palpable sense of unease spread through the room like wildfire. “Ms. Everly got up from her seat, locked the door and began to lower the blinds as other students began piling chairs and desks in front of the door.  


"Ms. Everly flicked the lights off, plunging the classroom into darkness that seemed to swallow us whole. We all squeezed beside each other in a corner, I sat next to Levi. Time seemed to drag on forever, as we all sat in silence. I allowed my mind to drift back to the thought of the military trucks heading into the mountains, the look of fear plastered on the soldiers' faces throughout my life there had never been a different vehicle going into the mountains What did they need all that firepower for?   
Suddenly, I snapped back to reality. Piercing screams tore through the silence, racing closer to our classroom, throughout the hall there was a desperate choir of pounding on doors and the echoes of lockers being smashed rang through the school. Some of the kids stared at the door in fear their bodies frozen with the shock at the sudden war zone outside, while others started to pray, not knowing if whatever is going on out in the hall will find its way to us.  
"After what felt like an eternity, the screams and echoes finally subsided, leaving us in draining silence, struggling to process what we had just heard. Levi, eager to investigate, began to get up from the corner, but I instinctively grabbed his shirt, my voice in a low	 whisper, 'Where are you going? He glanced down at me, his response delivered in the same hushed tone he always used, 'I just want to take a look,' he assured, gently pulling away, from my grip. He approached the classroom door with caution. Peering through a gap in the mess of the makeshift barricade, he let his eyes adjust to the dimness beyond. A slight, audible gasp escaped him, and he slowly retreated, stepping back towards the corner with an expression of repulsion etched across his face. The air felt thick as he sat back down, he spoke quickly   


"We need to get out of here now” The tone of his voice causing unwanted attention 'Why would we leave?' I said in protest. 'We're safer in here than out there. ‘No, we're not,' he hissed, his words cutting a little too loudly, drawing some unwanted attention. 'Whatever just happened out there, is going to happen to us if we do not leave. the hallway... it’s covered in bodies torn apart, limb from limb guts ripped out of bodies. Eventually, whatever did that will find us trapped in this room. We will be nothing more than easy pickings.  
We argued relentlessly until Ms. Everly intervened. 'Listen here, Levi,' she stated. “We were instructed to remain in the classroom until further notice, and that's precisely what we'll do.” Levi glanced up, a plea in his eyes, then turned away, muttering softly under his breath as he walked away. Moments later, a group of jocks, led by Nicholas the football captain, rose, heading to inspect the dimly lit hallway. Their curiosity quickly turned to utter disgust as they retreated, stammering in unison, 'Ms. Everly, Levi is right. We need to leave.' Ms. Everly's face contorted with rage at their reluctancy to follow directions. 'If I let you out, 'I could lose my job!'' she yelled.  
Nicholas, unphased, stood his ground. 'You don’t understand,' he stammered trying to find the right words to say, 'if we stay, you will have no job anyway. We will be nothing but more bloodstained bodies, just like the ones in the hallway.' He began walking toward the window, a mix of fear and urgency spread across his face."   
" 'Let's go,' he gestured to his group, moving towards the window, and cautiously parting the blinds. 'We can take a break for the parking lot and head for the police station. You can join us or stay—it's your call.' Nicholas had a sizable van that could accommodate all fifteen of us, albeit a tight fit.   
'I'm in,' came a voice.  
'Me too,' chimed another. Amidst the murmurs of agreement some students who were too stunned to act just cowered in the corner praying. Slowly the group that had formed walked towards the window.   
   
"Sasha was among them. We had been inseparable since birth, until her father forbade her from seeing me due to false rumors my father spread before he left. Despite her disbelief in them, a distance had grown between us. But that was irrelevant right now. I approached her, a sense of concern guiding my words. 'Sasha, are you sure about leaving the classroom? It's safer in here than out there, considering we have no idea about, what's happening outside right now.' "  
Here's a revised version of your paragraph:  
   
She sighed, her expression firm. "Yes, I want to leave. You should come to get help too, and it would be better if I brought you with me when we try to find your mom." I groaned, attempting to reason, "Look, if whatever caused this chaos inside the school has made its way outside, we should stay here until help arrives." She stared blankly at me for a moment, then turned to face the group that had already clambered out of the window, jogging towards the student parking lot.   
   
"Look, I'm leaving, and that's final. If you don't want to come, so be it, but just promise me you won't end up a corpse when we come back with help." I recoiled, taken aback by her harsh yet oddly caring tone. "Uh... yeah, I promise." And with that, she turned to head towards the parking lot.  
   
As we heard Nicholas turn the key in the ignition, everyone hurriedly piled into the van. While Sasha lagged behind them. The engine roared to life, and just as the vehicle began to reverse, a blood-curdling scream came from a distance down the road. I instinctively leaned out of the window, scanning the surroundings, my body went into shock as I saw three grotesque humanoid figures, towering at least six feet tall, sprinting towards the van with unnaturally elongated limbs and chillingly wide grins plastered onto their faces. Frozen in horror, I watched as these creatures pounced on the vehicle, viciously clawing at its doors. Letting out shrieks as they did so.  
In a horrific blur, the creatures breached the van, wrenching the doors open. Before anyone could react, the students inside were dragged out and met a gruesome fate. Limbs torn, helpless cries drowned by the terrorizing screams My heart pounded in my chest my brain kept telling to move or do something to get away from those… things   
"My blood turned to ice as I watched one of the creatures slowly lift its head, locking eyes with Sasha as she did her best to run back towards the window. It rose slowly, examining her through its cold dead gaze, before letting out a shrill shriek and lunging towards me. Regaining control of my body, I screamed for Sasha to hurry and as the monster began gaining on her she slid through the window and slammed it down behind her.   
With adrenaline pumping through me, I yelled for the others to move the barricade from the door, insisting that the classroom was no longer safe. Ms. Everly swiftly began clearing chairs and desks from the door's path. The shrieks grew louder, the sound sending chills through me as my heart pounded in my chest. Glancing behind me, I recoiled towards the door as I saw the creatures peering through the window, its gaze fixated on its next potential prey."  
This passage creates a tense and urgent atmosphere. Here's a revised version to enhance the suspense:  
   
"Stepping back cautiously toward the door, relief washed over us as the barricades finally came down. We hurried out of the room, rushing down the hall toward the gymnasium where the school's basement was. Arriving at the door, the sound of shattering glass echoed as Ms. Everly struggled with her keys.  
 Glancing back, I saw a distorted face, driven by hunger, emerging from the classroom. With a twist, Ms. Everly flung the doors open, and we hastily entered, swiftly locking them behind us. We scanned the surroundings cautiously, but the area appeared eerily empty. The short-lived relief shattered as the entity chasing us began violently pounding on the gym doors. Some students had already placed the coaches' desks in front of the door, and collectively, we prayed for it to hold against the relentless banging. After about 5 minutes the creature lost interest in us and left its footsteps thundering down the hall  
"While everyone else gathered around, waiting for Ms. Everly to unlock the entrance to the basement, my instincts drove me toward the back door. My intention was to secure it against any potential threats trying to get in. However, an odd noise came from a dressing room connected to the theater.   
 Slowly, I approached the doorway, cautiously peering inside. Fumbling for the light switch on the wall, I finally found it and flicked it on. The sudden flood of light revealed an empty room, devoid of any sign of life. Disappointed, I switched off the lights, shut the door and made my way back towards the group. I walked down the dark passage that led into the basement and joined up with Levi. We started going through the supplies in the basement hoping we would have enough for the 10 of us to last a little while. Levi and I brought all the food and water we found to the main room where we found a few students examining Sashas leg, she had cut it up pretty bad when she climbed through the window. “We need to stop the bleeding and cover it up, so it doesn’t get infected one of students said.  
"Suddenly, I remembered there was a first aid kit in the coach's office. 'I know where to get some bandages; there's a kit in the coach's office,' I informed. 'Great, grab it and bring it back here,' he responded. I made my way towards the door and cautiously peered out. Seeing no immediate danger, I stepped out, heading for the office.  
   
Upon reaching the office, I crouched down and opened the drawer, finding not only the kit but also some snacks. Securing them, I returned to the basement entrance, scanning the gym as I walked back. While doing so, I noticed the dressing room door was slightly cracked open.  
"Strange, I swear I shut that door," I thought to myself, considering the possibility that someone else might have investigated the sound. I walked back to the rest of the group and handed the kit to the boy I spoke to earlier. They had managed to stop the bleeding, but Sasha remained unconscious. I went to find Ms. Everly.  
"Do we have enough supplies to last us a while?" I asked, hoping for some positive news. Ms. Everly sighed; her expression solemn. "From what I can tell, we only have enough to last us maybe a week at most. But who knows how long it will take for help to arrive. “I went silent my breath felt heavy and a lump formed in my throat I was still struggling to process how all of this had just happened just two hours ago I was saying goodbye to my mom and Iris and the next being locked inside school with killer monsters. I found a corner in the room and decided to get some rest.  
I awoke few hours later, getting up slowly I walked over to Sasha who was struggling to reach a bottle of water she had dropped. “Here” I said grabbing the water and handing it to her “thanks” she replied open it up and taking a sip. She looked up at me “what do you think caused all of this to happen” she asked trying to sit up right. “I don’t know but I actually might have  a theory” “Wait really?” she said softly “what is it?” “Well I don’t actually know if its related but this morning I saw Military trucks going towards the mountains with soldiers inside they all had guns and explosives.”
