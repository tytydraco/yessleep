Salted squid, a friend of rice. It is delicious, isn’t it?
I love it so much.
What I have written this time is a story about this salted squid.

I can’t mention the actual name of the place, and in consideration of reputational damage, I’m going to introduce a story I’m afraid I’ve heard.
If you like salted squid or don’t like long stories, please skip this one.

In a certain area, salted squid was quite popular.
Anyone in the village could make it.
Shiokara(salted squid) is a simple dish of cutting squid into strips and mixing them with squid guts and salt.

The taste varies widely, depending on the person who makes it.
Among the local people, there is one who makes the most delicious salted squid.

Let us call him Mr. Hwangmura.
The salted squid made by Mr. Hwangmura is so rich that it is literally on a different level from other salted squid.

By the way, even the salted squid made by the villagers
It is incomparably better than the commercially available salted squid.
I think you can understand how delicious Mr. Hwangmura’s salted squid is.

Of course I want the reputable supplier to supervise the commercial product! or from the village head
to publish the recipe to help revitalize the village! The requests came in flooding in.

Even so, Mr. Hwangmura never shook his head and only made a very small amount of the product for the villagers.
He never allowed anyone but the villagers to eat it.

In fact, until a few years ago, Mr. Hwangmura was a newcomer to the village.
He was treated like an outcast by the village.

He endured this situation and stubbornly avoided contact with the villagers.
However, after he lost his family in an incident a few years ago, he became a different person.

He began to flatter and get involved with the villagers.
Naturally, he was a person who had been ostracized by the villagers, and at first he seemed to be treated with disdain, however, he built a good relationship with the villagers with his delicious salted squid.

For this reason, Mr. Hwangmura’s salted squid is an important key that connects the villagers and Mr.Hwangmura.

If the method was revealed, the villagers would treat him as a nuisance again.
Everyone thought so.
The basis for this was that they got along well with other new families who were being ostracized by the village.
They were ostensibly friendly, but they never fed him salted squid.

who were jealous of Mr. Hwangmura’s persistent secrecy about the manufacturing method, finally caused an incident.

They broke into Mr. Hwangmura’s house undercover and threatened him with a knife
They tried to force him to tell them the method.

In the end, Mr.Hwangmura finally agreed to teach the method to everyone
“I will gather everyone tomorrow night.
I’m not interested in your identity and I won’t pry into your affairs, so please don’t kill me.
Please, please go home.”

Indeed, if another person made the same salt squid after Mr. Hwangmura died, the murderer of Mr. Hwangmura would be immediately known. 

The murderer left without doing anything to avoid that.
The next night, many if not all of the villagers gathered to learn the secret of Mr. Hwangmura’s salt squid.

First, he served his usual salt squid to the villagers and let them enjoy it.
After the villagers had enjoyed the salt squid, the process was revealed to the public.

Mr. Huang, covered in greasy sweat and trembling, kept whispering, “No…No….No….”
He seemed to be in very poor health.
However, after watching everyone enjoy the salt squid, Mr. Hwangmura’s pale, sweat-soaked face broke out into a thin smile and he was very skillful in his cooking.

Then he mixed in strips of squid, and finally added something that looked like grayish albacore.

It was a very normal way of making it.When the villagers asked, “Is that albacore?”
Mr. Hwangmura said “It’s brain,”
“It is the brain of my family members who were tortured and killed by you.”

In fact, Mr. Hwangmura’s daughter and wife committed suicide several years ago because they could not bear to be treated as an obstacle by the villagers.

The rumor among the newcomers to the village was that his wife and child had been forced to commit suicide under false pretenses
The details of the circumstances of their deaths were not available, but it was rumored that not only his wife, but also his young daughter, had been raped by the villagers.

However, it was ruled a “suicide” without any thorough investigation.
The funeral was held only by newcomers to the village, and the body was in normal condition.

Perhaps Mr. Hwangmura inserted an iron rod through his nose and pulled out the brain to preserve it, so as not to damage the bodies of his murdered family members.

He continued to feed the villagers delicious salt squid mixed with the scraped brains.

Finally, with a pale face, Mr. Hwangmura said to the villagers
“I curse you all…. ah… ah… ah… ah… ah… ah… ah… ah…”

He died on the spot, laughing as he said, “I don’t want to….
Until the moment of his death, he kept muttering, “No…No…” he kept muttering to himself until the moment of his death.Later, when we examined Mr. Hwangmura’s body, we found a brand-new stitch wound on his abdomen.

When the body was opened, the liver was nowhere to be found.
In Mr. Mr. Hwangmura’s house, there was a small amount of liver (about half of it) that had been removed and a small amount of brain that had probably been scraped out from the body of a family member.

The other half of the liver…probably….
The last words suggest that he was trying to put some kind of curse on the villagers by feeding them the brains and livers of his own family members who had been persecuted and murdered.

We do not know how the curse turned out in the end.
Most of the villagers survived the incident.

After the incident, for some reason, a family and the son of the village head had a stomachache.

After the incident, a family and the son of a village headman died of a stomachache, coughing up blood.
When their bodies were dissected, all the organs from the diaphragm down were pink, red, and black, as if all the organs had been mixed together.

It was like a salt squid.
