Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to this message board with a heavy heart and a sense of deep fear, hoping against hope for some guidance and assistance. My cousin Alex, an artist I dearly miss, vanished without a trace about six months ago. In my attempt to understand his disappearance, I stumbled upon something unsettling in his art studio – a paint called Cursed Midnight Oil.

Below, I've shared the correspondence between the company's customer service team that sells this paint and me. It's not just ordinary paint.

As you go through the emails, you'll witness my growing terror and confusion, exacerbated by the strange responses I received from customer service. They talk about curses, gateways, and celestial events, leaving me feeling lost and scared.

I'm laying all this out here because I'm genuinely afraid. The shadows from the paint seem to be spreading, and I can't shake off the fear that I might disappear, just like Alex. I'm seeking any advice, insights, solutions – anything that might help.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate any help you can provide.

>Dear \[Customer Service Email\],  
>  
>I hope you're doing well and staying healthy. I'm writing to you today with a deep sense of urgency and genuine concern regarding a transaction my dear cousin Alex made on your esteemed platform.  
>  
>My cousin Alex and I shared a passion for art, so our family tasked me with clearing out his studio. Alex went missing about half a year ago, and I still miss him. I jumped at the chance to reminisce and be the careful guardian of his beloved art supplies.  
>  
>I was concerned about what I might find, considering the studio was the last place anyone had seen him. Maybe a note or evidence of unknown bad habits. Surprisingly, I found something that may be linked to his disappearance and his inclination towards more experimental art.  
>  
>Nostalgia washed over me as I began my journey through his sketchbooks piled on his desk, each page a testament to his artistic brilliance. Yet, this stroll down memory lane took an unsettling turn when I spotted an oddity on one page—a kind of endless hole that led to nothing when I turned to the next. Subsequent pages revealed more peculiarities: sketches marked by unsettling black spots that defied conventional understanding.  
>  
>Flipping through to the end of the book, I found a drawing of a meticulously detailed and lifelike drawing of a demon with strange symbols around it. Vertigo hit me as the image mesmerized me. The demon's eyes, two deep black voids, emitted an eerie presence as if they were reaching out to ensnare me for daring to gaze upon them. I closed the sketchbook, feeling uneasy. These strange drawings might connect to Alex's disappearance. Alex had always sought the strange and mysterious, but had the strange and mysterious now found him?  
>  
>While organizing Alex's art studio after his unexplained disappearance, I found an old oak cabinet tucked away in a dusty corner. Amongst jars of dried pigment and bottles of solvents, I noticed a small jar adorned with intricate silver script that read: "Cursed Midnight Oil - the blackest black." The sleek glass surface of the jar seemed to absorb light, leaving a lasting impression of depth and mystery. As I reached out to touch it, a chill passed through my fingertips, and upon lifting the heavy lid, wisps of inky vapor escaped, swirling and whispering like smoke from a snuffed-out candle. I gently waved my hand through the ethereal tendrils, watching them dissolve into nothingness.  
>  
>Motivated by an unquenchable curiosity, a deep love for art, and a sense of nostalgia, I couldn't resist the temptation to delve into the mysteries concealed within the Cursed Midnight Oil - a paint renowned for its unparalleled darkness. Little did I know of the profound and unsettling consequences that would ensue. As I dipped my brush into the jar, a bone-chilling coldness filled the room, and a thick, black liquid slowly dripped onto the canvas. The texture of the paint, akin to the very essence of midnight, sent shivers down my spine.  
>  
>The fine hairs on my neck prickled as if from an unseen gaze. With my breath held tight in my throat, I swept a tentative stroke down the stark white linen... and felt reality shift around me. As the first stroke graced the canvas, an eerie sensation washed over me, sending shivers down my spine.  
>  
>Shadows stretched and spread like wings, softly brushing against the walls in a silent whisper. Their ethereal tendrils formed intricate symbols that danced at the edge of my vision.  
>  
>From the glistening wet paint, phantasmal forms writhed into being, beckoning towards me with obscured faces and grasping hands that billowed into tatters of midnight fog whenever I tried to focus upon them directly.  
>  
>The temperature plummeted, my breath misting white as rime frost crawled across the studio windows in fractal patterns. Eyes watering against the impossible cold, I could not look away as worlds beyond worlds yawned wide before me, all from a single loaded brush held paralyzed in my trembling hand. What had I awoken? The question rolled through me like waves pulled to shore, building force as they moved.  
>  
>Amidst the swirling shadows and spectral forms, I tore my gaze away to examine the glass jar in my paint-flecked hand. Strange markings etched along the base - arcane symbols and twisted runes - teased my mind like the recollections of a half-remembered dream.  
>  
>Brushing a thumb over the carvings released a discharge of energy, manifesting as a vision behind my eyes. Figures cloaked in black cowls chanting ominously around a stone dolmen beneath the bloated red moon. A wretched creature, man-like but not, painting insane glyphs with a brush that dripped and shone. A rising vortex of shimmering darkness that drank the stars from the sky above.  
>  
>Intrigued yet apprehensive, I delved further into the mysteries of the "Cursed Midnight Oil." The packaging contained cryptic warnings that spoke volumes about the gravity of the paint's nature.  
>  
>Instructions warned against painting specific symbols, suggesting one could "unseal doors better left untouched." Strangely, some arcane force etched those same symbols in the margins of my vision. Would you happen to have any more information about these gateways and doorways?  
>  
>A warning cautioned against using the paint during an eclipse or celestial event, as this may magnify the paint's power. Could you clarify what qualifies as a celestial event?  
>  
>The final scratched-out line ominously instructed that a black candle is necessary to finish any painting, leaving the reasons vague. Can you clarify the necessity of the black candle and if it needs to be lit or just around?  
>  
>I found myself fixated on the shapes that continued to writhe in the unsettling darkness that enveloped me, slowly grasping the gravity of the situation. With a heavy heart, I set my brush aside, gathered my belongings, and vacated the studio. Before leaving, I took the precaution of locking the door and placing a warning sign, urging others to stay away because of the presence of hazardous fumes. I made a firm decision not to return until I could gain a better understanding of the formidable forces that I had inadvertently awakened through my reckless actions.  
>  
>A heavy dread permeated my entire being as the reality of what I had discovered settled over me. This was no ordinary tube of paint - forces beyond my comprehension were at play, awakened by my reckless curiosity. I paced about the studio, eyes darting warily at the shadows that still fluttered at the edge of sight, wispy as smoke.  
>  
>Worst of all, one of these apparitions looked heartbreakingly similar to my cousin, Alex. He painted symbols and sigils as his paint, brush, and hand all seemed to blend. His face was blank, and posture defeated.  
>  
>Honest question: Is this genuinely cursed paint?  
>  
>The weight of responsibility felt crushing. I had stumbled upon the secrets of this arcane substance - its power, cryptic warnings, and delicate balance with our world. Yet, who would believe such a fantastic account without seeing the manifestations themselves? Then would they be in the same situation as me? The same situation that may be behind Alex's disappearance?  
>  
>I dreaded incredulous dismissal, or worse, being blamed for Alex's unsolved disappearance, somehow connected to this strange paint.  
>  
>No, I could not turn to others just yet. In the quiet solitude of the dusty studio, I swore a personal oath: I must fully unravel the mysteries shrouding this Cursed Midnight Oil, lest the secrets die with me.  
>  
>In my quest for answers, I started with the website from which Alex had bought the "Cursed Midnight Oil." Your website. It has a unique and exciting design. My digital journey was fraught with unsettling imagery and cryptic messages, as if the website held the keys to an unknown world. It was an unnerving experience that deepened my sense of unease and left me with countless questions and doubts, seeking your guidance to help me navigate this intricate web of confusion.  
>  
>The simple web design barely masked the disturbing content within - a link on the site's front page declared, " Have you tried the blackest black paint in this world or any other? " Paint Beyond the Veil—Cursed Midnight Oil: The Abyss Beckons, Your Canvas Awaits!  
>  
>I heard strange chants and discordant music when I leaned closer to my speakers. Even after I muted my laptop, the sound continued. Is this a bug with your site? I got the sound to stop by turning off my computer. However, after such a strange experience, it found its way into my dreams, and I missed it the next day. Is there something subliminal in the sound, or did it just connect with my subconscious? I left a browser window open to the site to keep the sound playing throughout the day. Compliments to your composer.  
>  
>As I clicked through page after page, the serialized links formed a disjointed map to... where? Some unfathomable dimension of the arcane arts? I could feel unseen eyes tracking my journey through the ether, just beyond the veil of our sane reality. I logged off in frustrated dismay with no solid answers found, only fruitlessly obscure allusions and Stygian imagery. Fulfilling this quest for enlightenment would take a lot of work.  
>  
>After hours spent unsuccessfully combing through occult forums and arcane indexes, I am contacting you in desperate need of advice. I jump at shadows, wondering what demonic forces guide their wispy movements. The discovery of this paint has become a nightmare journey through unknown realms. One I cannot navigate alone.  
>  
>With sincerity and humility, I plea for your help. My reckless curiosity set loose forces that defy our conventional understanding. Do I need to perform cleansing rituals or employ protective wards to safeguard myself and others from the influence of this shadowy substance? Can I take any action to lessen the risks associated with the "Cursed Midnight Oil"?  
>  
>Most pressingly, though the studio remains sealed, the dense shadows now permeate the walls, their smoky shapes spreading outward with every sunset. I wish no harm to others because of my foolhardy meddling. Please, I beg you to offer any wisdom to contain what I have awakened from its slumber behind the veil.  
>  
>If you could promptly attend to this matter, I would greatly appreciate it, as I am currently entangled in a complex and unsettling puzzle of uncertainty and apprehension. I place my trust in your expertise and your unwavering commitment to the well-being of your customers. With utmost deference, I eagerly await your enlightened guidance to unravel the mysteries that shroud the "Cursed Midnight Oil."  
>  
>I extend my deepest gratitude for your time and consideration. I anticipate your guidance in lifting the anchor that threatens to drag me into the depths of madness and shadow.

>Sincerely,

>  
>I understand the emotional weight tied to your cousin Alex's disappearance and the unexpected discoveries in his art studio. It's clear you have a deep connection to the world of art and a genuine concern for the well-being of those who may have interacted with this unique product.  
>  
>To follow up on your concerns, I want to assure you that our marketing does not intend to deceive customers. The term "Cursed Midnight Oil" conveys the product's arcane nature and uniqueness. While the supernatural events you described align with the expected side effects, it's very important to note that the warnings and instructions provided are designed to guide users in navigating or preventing these occurrences.  
>  
>Regarding the mysterious disappearance of your cousin Alex—first, I'm sorry for your loss—we acknowledge that such events have been reported by users of the "Cursed Midnight Oil." However, as customer service agents, we lack specific details about the destinations of those who vanished. It might be worth considering seeking guidance from the entities in the abyss of the paint, though I caution you about the potential dangers associated with such endeavors. Not all entities engage with kindness or an understanding of the fragility of the human psyche.  
>  
>However, artists, being free spirits, may disappear for various reasons beyond the influence of the paint. Have you looked into local festivals and carnivals?  
>  
>I'm pleased to hear your compliments about our website design and sound composition. Our team works diligently to create an immersive and haunting online experience for our customers.  
>  
>The symbols mentioned in the packaging and imprinted in your vision are associated with specific gateways and doorways. I do not know where these gateways go, but I understand they should remain closed. I strongly suggest never recreating the symbols, especially not with the Cursed Midnight Oil. This may be difficult as they may try to convince you to work with them. Don't. The symbols are bad.

1. The symbols mentioned in the packaging and imprinted in your vision are associated with specific gateways and doorways. I do not have details on where these gateways go, but I understand they should remain closed. I strongly suggest never recreating the symbols, especially not with the Cursed Midnight Oil. This may be difficult as they may try to convince you to work with them. Don't. The symbols are bad.
2. In the product's context, a celestial event refers to occurrences like eclipses or celestial alignments. Painting during such events may amplify the paint's power, potentially leading to uncontrollable outcomes. You can find a list of celestial events on our website by going to the site's footer, clicking the Terms and Conditions,  selecting Cursed Midnight Oil, selecting warnings and restrictions, scrolling to the Timing section, and clicking the link for Celestial Events.
3. The necessity of a black candle for finishing a painting is a crucial aspect of the process. Unfortunately, my documentation does not specify whether the candle needs to be lit. I will look into this matter further and give you a more detailed response as soon as possible.
