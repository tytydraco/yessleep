For the past few weeks, I have been avoiding the metro. It's not because of my claustrophobia, nor is it because of the endless crowds of bored faces that stare at my every move. No, it's something new. I foresee a stranger's death. Well so I think.

Every night, it's the exact same scenario. I make my way to the platform, and I see this beautiful, stunning young lady. She wears a business casual outfit, black blazer, high heels, the usual deal. She looks like she's ready to collapse on her couch at home after a long day of work. In her hand, she holds a briefcase. 

She sits down on the cold metal bench, and opens the briefcase. I always try to stop her. I never can. 

As she stares at the contents, her pupils dilate. The woman then stands up, the clicking of her heels are drowned out by the approaching metro. And then... she jumps. Her blood and gore flying all over the platform and me as I weep trying to stop her. That's the moment that I wake up.

I haven't told anyone about these dreams. I would sound crazy if I told someone I was afraid of the metro. But after what happened today, I have to clear my name.

My day was pretty normal until I couldn't start my car after work. As rain droplets danced off the glass of my car, waiting in the storm for the car repair guys to come didn't seem too appealing. So, against my gut instinct, I descended into the depths of the subway. 

I pushed my way through the jungle of indifferent bodies, it felt as if their eyes burnt a hole in the back of my skull as I passed. I hated crowds. I hated small spaces. I hated crowded small spaces. 

All this while I had the woman in the back of my mind. I prayed to God above that I would not see her. And if I did see her, I hoped that I would do something.

I made my way through the ocean of people down to the platform. I scanned the crowd, hoping that the lady would evade me. 

She was nowhere in sight. No woman, no briefcase. And as the metro arrived, I felt a moment of relief. I took a seat with a boulder lifted from my shoulders. Or so I thought. For as the doors were closing, a hand reached out to stop them. It was the woman from my dreams. Same blazer, same tired look, same briefcase.

I froze in fear as she took a seat across from me. This diverged from my dream. This had never happened before. What should I do?

I did not have much time to act, as the woman laid the briefcase flat on her lap. She was about to open it.

Click.

One of the latches opened. I had to take that thing away from her. Even if there was the slightest chance that the events from the dream were to come true, I had to prevent it. Who knows what she could do instead of jumping in front of the train. She was a risk to her and everyone's safety.

Click.

The second latch opened. I couldn't possibly go and take the briefcase from her. Everyone would think that I'm a nutcase. The dream didn't even go like this, this must just be a very weird case of Deja Vu.

The moment lingered as she pressed her thumbs into the opening, prepared to unleash whatever was in the briefcase.

"Excuse me ma'am."

I said with about as much fake bravado as I could muster.

"Don't open it."

She looked at me with a confused, done-with-my-bullshit type of look.

"Excuse you?"

Her sharp words pierced me. I didn't plan this far ahead.

"I-It's difficult to explain."

I stuttered, fake confidence gone.

"Is there a problem, son?"

One of the passengers asked as he laid his giant hand on my shoulder.

"Just g-give me the briefcase"

Just give me the briefcase? What was I thinking?

The woman looked extremely uncomfortable. Which was understandable from her perspective.

At this point I felt the entire carriage's eyes staring at me. As if I was a zoo animal. 

"We are now arriving at-"

I didn't let the announcer finish. I grabbed the briefcase and ran towards the doors as they opened.

Some angry passengers ran after me. They quickly forced me to the ground. Fist to face. Kick to ribs. Elbow to nose. It felt like hours, but a woman’s scream sliced through it; it couldn’t have been more than seconds.

I looked over towards the metro and saw the lady that had the briefcase. Her heel got caught in the gap between the platform and carriage.

She fell on the ground as the metro started speeding off, dragging her along with it. You could hear her clawing, trying to find a grip on the slippery metro floor, only to have her nails break under the pressure.

The men rushed over to help her, and I used this to make my exit. I tried to block out the silence, but it was difficult as the screams turned into the sound of flesh ripping and bones cracking.

As I got on the escalator, I wanted to take one last look at the platform. But I couldn't. I couldnt see my dream be realised.

I ran out of the station. I stopped at the middle of a bridge when I figured no one could've followed me.

As I sat down, vomit and tears erupted from my face. What have I done? All because of a stupid dream.

I sat with the briefcase. I looked at it from the outside, totally unremarkable. And then, curiosity got the best of me.

The latches of the briefcase flew open as I lifted the top.

My eyes widened, it was office supplies. Documents. Folders. Nothing remarkable. 

So here I am, standing on the edge of the bridge. I have full intent to jump. But I had to clear my name first. I wish I could apologise to her, but I guess you will have to do. 

I'm sorry.
