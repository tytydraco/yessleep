Hi, I greet you from the store.

Some ask me why I am still in this town and mainly, why I am still working here. Easy. I have nowhere to go and this is the only "reliable" job I have in this miserable town (the one that pays the best, let's say).

Let's continue with more stories:

It is the night of December 24, 2022 and it is snowing in the town but everything seems normal. We have to work with Emily, as I said before, the store is always open and for working on Christmas night, Mrs. B (the owner) pays us a little more.

Little by little customers come to buy alcohol, soft drinks and some things for their Christmas dinners.

It all started at twelve with the visit of Santa Claus.

That Santa Claus who came to the store was normal. A simple bearded and chubby old man like the one in the movies with the clothes of said character. In addition, he had a mysterious package with him.

"Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas everyone!" Santa exclaimed. His voice was somewhat serious.

"Nice costume!" Emily said with a smile on her face.

"Ho-ho-...Wait, Costume?"

"Yeah buddy, that looks really cool." I told.

"It's not a costume! I'm Santa and I bring you a gift guys."

"It's okay, it's not a costume." Emily said, amused and playing along.

"Wich is the gift?" I inquired.

"It's in this package!" So the guy in the costume, or Santa, or whatever he was, left the package on the counter.

"They have to open it!"

The package was surrounded by a lot of tape, too much. I went to look for a knife to open it and so I did. Big mistake...

Inside the package was a large red box with small white stars and a green bow. I opened it and with Emily, we screamed...

A disgusting smell came from the package and there was something inside. They were organs. A heart, a lung, a kidney, a liver and a little bit of skin. There were bones too.

We turned pale, we were very afraid and we started vomiting. All while Santa was talking and laughing with a disturbing voice: "Ho-ho-ho, merry Christmas, I hope you enjoy it."

Then, "Santa" began to transform into a terrible monster. On a very skinny, bony, dark creature, it looked burned. He had completely white eyes, a hideous smile, yellow teeth that looked very sharp, and claws on his feet and hands. It also had a long tail. As he transformed he laughed loudly and his voice grew deeper with each passing moment.

After a few moments, he said, "See you." And he went to the forests.

After being paralyzed for a long time, we were somehow able to calm down. We had to call the police to see what that thing had given us and we showed them the security cameras and they believed us. After that, we heard nothing more about the matter.

We were scared and paranoid all night until the shift ended at eight in the morning.

I think that's it for the post, I still want to tell some more stories. Greetings to all and, take care.
