So, to start, my boyfriend has always been a healthy person. He has no history in his family of cancer or genetic disorders or diseases. He’s never gotten sicker than a cold so long as I’ve been with him, which is why I’m so worried about him. 

I l should back up to what happened last week. 

About a week ago, we went hiking in a remote area with a group of seven including us. There’s some obscure local folklore, something about a plague from the gods I think, and so one of the friends who came along brought their amateur ghost hunting equipment. 

We hiked up to a creepy cave at the summit, and the friend with the ghost hunting equipment wanted to go in to investigate further and tried to convince the rest of us to go with them, but we all said “hell no”. All of us except for my boyfriend, he’s a people pleasing idiot. 

They came back out about an hour later, and my boyfriend looked like he had seen a ghost. Also, he seemed physically worse; pale and tripping over his own feet. Our friend looked a little discombobulated, but started rambling about emf readings and otherworldly energies or whatever. I was more concerned with my boyfriend, who promptly fainted into my arms. 

He came to a few minutes later and we made it down the mountain just fine, but he hasn’t been the same since. 

It started with coughing, then the next day he was puking, and finally he lost use of his legs and arms. He’s also grown bizarre yellow, painful, puss filled boils on his arms, legs, hands, feet, and face. Yesterday, I accidentally bursted one of the boils and got some puss on my skin, it was disgusting! 

As for his mental state, it’s been super weird. He’s become paranoid and jumpy while he was super laid back before. He’s constantly saying that he’s going to die and begging me to kill him “before anyone else has to die”, which has me terrified of what he might know that I don’t know, or of what he saw in that damn cave. He still smiles and thanks me for looking after him, but he’s completely convinced of his own impending doom. It’s honestly so creepy, it’s like he’s a completely different person. 

He has been bedridden for days, and is getting paler and weaker by the hour. He’s so week he can’t feed himself and we’ve had to resort to adult diapers. I feel so guilty because I have to leave him home alone for twelve hours or more when I got to work. I’m doing all I can for him, and he’s been very gracious through it all. We’re in the USA, and really can’t afford to go to the hospital right now, especially now that he’s been unable to go to work for the last few days, but I’m at my wit’s end. 

Also, I’ve recently developed a slight cough.
