Hi, my name is Brian.

I'm 29 years old.

And I found a talking, severed mouth to neck thing named Justin.



Before I get into any of that, I should pick up from where I left off in my first post. After I saw that squirrel get torn apart by rain drops of all things, the reality of my situation finally hit me. Before that, it felt like some strange nightmare that I could not wake up from, but that moment made it real. Across the street, I saw a lost child crying. I couldn't do a damn thing.



I stayed by the entrance half a day. People came and went; the doors opened for them, never for me. The sensors saw everyone but me. The isolation was getting old fast, hollowing me out. My right hand was gone now, same as the fingers. I hope that woman from the park isn't suffering. It doesn't get easier to think about.



I didn't see Kyle once. Waiting is easy when you never get tired. I still haven't needed to sleep, eat, or drink. No hunger, no thirst, no exhaustion. Not even the urge to piss. My body doesn't seem to function at all anymore. No pain from the cold, no chills, no runny nose. I did not feel any other urges either. For a while, I really believed I was a ghost.



With nothing else to do, I thought things through. Maybe I missed Kyle on his way out. He's the type who would start worrying if I did not show up within thirty minutes. Maybe he left before I got there and went looking for me. I stayed near his building anyway because I did not know where else to go. It was the closest place for me to sit and think. He never came back, so I left.



When I finally decided to check my place, I moved carefully. Wildlife was the biggest danger, unpredictable and quick. A single bird or rat could end me. I had a few close calls, but I made it. I shuddered at the thought of a murder of crows swooping my way. The front door to my building was propped open like it was welcoming me back. I ran inside, and slipped through my half-open front door.



I saw my mom, dad, and brother in the kitchen talking. I stayed around the corner, careful not to get too close. They had filed a missing persons report. My mom was crying into my dad's chest. My brother was scrolling frantically through his phone. Kyle sat on the living room couch, hands locked together on his lap, staring at the floor, silent. I could see the guilt in his eyes. He probably thought my disappearance was his fault. But it wasn't. It was mine for messing around with things I don't understand. If I hadn't gone back and tried to recreate that strange sensation that pulled me into this place, I would still be fine. We would have watched some dumb horror movie and laughed and gone on with our lives. But I could not tell him any of that. Maybe never.



I stepped close to my mom and yelled in her ear. Mom, mom. Nothing. I already knew it wouldn't work, but I did it anyway to get it out of my system. I looked at all of them, and at Kyle, who is like a brother to me. Then I went outside and sat on the stairs. I started piecing together the rules, or what pass for rules here in this trap dimension. A game between motion and stillness. The faster the contact, the harder it hits us. That's the closest thing I have to science here.



And then it hit me. What if alleyway 3 was not the only place where the phenomenon could occur. Maybe there are more spots. Maybe there is a way out after all. I turned around, dashed into the lobby, almost bumping into a fake plant in the first floor hallway, ran into my place, and started testing everything. I tried walking at my normal pace in the kitchen, the living room, the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the closets. Every hallway, every corner. Nothing. I felt stupid after a while, but at least I tried.



By the time I stopped, my parents were gone putting up posters. Only Kyle and my brother were still there, sitting at opposite ends of the couch. I sat between them. The couch didn't react to me. It felt like I was trying to make myself comfortable on top of a rough boulder. I shifted around, forgetting I couldn't affect the physical world anymore. The couch began swallowing me. Slowly at first, then faster, like quicksand. I panicked as I sank through it, into the floor, through the beams, until I fell into the basement.



I hit the concrete halfway inside it, right next to the washing machines. Forcing myself out felt like swimming through thick tar. I went back upstairs and my front door was closed. I looked at it for a long time and smiled a little. I could have forced my way back through the door, but I didn't. The floor still felt soft under my feet, like it remembered trying to swallow me. I left. Next time I step into that building, it'll be in the home dimension... and I'm hugging everyone until they can't breathe.



After that grim, one sided reunion, I wandered the streets again. The sky was gray. The angels were spitting on me, each raindrop pushing me down a little further, not into the ground but to my knees. Small things barely affect me, but heavier things hit harder, especially in clusters. It seems like mass still plays by the rules here, at least a little.



I went back to alleyway #3 and repeated my steps again and again, trying to feel that same force that pulled me over. Nothing happened. I think that door only goes one way, if I can even call it a door. If there is another one that leads back, I will find it. I will keep walking at my normal pace and hope for that same pull again. Maybe it will be worse next time. Maybe I will vanish completely, forgotten to the world. Maybe I will come home.



Seeing my family and not being able to touch them was the hardest thing I have ever experienced. I bit my lower lip until I felt pressure, but no pain. I guess that is my way of grounding myself now. I didn't want to get angry again. I didn't want to lose more of me to this wretched place.



After leaving the alley, I decided to test other spaces between places. More alleyways, side streets, abandoned buildings. Places people rarely go. For some reason it felt like those might hold the same strange energy. Maybe that was the desperation talking, but I didn't have any better ideas. The one good thing about not needing rest is that I can keep moving. No exhaustion, no limits. I can search for days. I still get mentally tired, but it fades fast, thankfully.



I was keeping a tally on my phone when it happened. Alleyway #57. I heard something. It sounded like a muffled whisper, like a prayer coming from under the asphalt. I followed the sound to the middle of the alley, knelt down, and pressed my hand into the pavement. It felt like soft butter. My fingers found something thick and fleshy sealed in a plastic bag. I pulled it out, and there he was. A mouth. A neck stump. Stubble. Alive. Moving. Talking. The only other living thing I have found in this silent, broken world. My new friend. More on that next time. I swear my index finger is cramping up even if I can't feel it doing that.
