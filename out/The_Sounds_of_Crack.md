Hey Reddit, its been a while since i used this website but I felt I needed to get this off my chest. A story that no one would ever believe but I figured I needed to get it out there somehow. You can call me crazy all you want but this really happened.

One day when I was just 16 years old, i went walking down a path I’d often walk. This path would pass by some trees and the occasional car/truck parked in the driveway of some home. At the end of the path, leads a dirt trail that goes through the forest. This part was always my favourite as the scenery of this forest was just mesmerizing to look at.

However one day when I traversed through the trees and bushes, i heard a loud snap off in the distance. I didn’t think much of it at first but a minute later i would hear that same sound. “CRACK!” This weirded me out a bit but i figured it was probably just some deer or something. Moments later i hear that same sound. “CRACK!” At this point i started to realize that this sound is the same every time. As if its a sound effect. a chill ran down my spine and I decided to turn around and head home.

After about 5 minutes with no crack sounds, i figured that whatever was making those noises was gone. Then all of a sudden, “CRACK!” Mere metres away from me coming from the bush. My soul jumped right out of my body from the sheer sudden sound. I turn my head to see a large tree bent over me with it’s branches descending down onto me and wrapping  themselves around my arms and neck. I lurched forward to try and escape but to no avail. The snapping sounds intensified as this slender tree lifted me up in the air. Panic started washing over me at this point and I began to scream for help. I clench my teeth as i feel the tree’s branches tighten around my limbs ard start pulling. I scream out in a futile effort to drown out the pain as i feel my flesh beginning to tear at my limbs. At first, my left arm was ripped off. Its a surreal experience seeing your own arm disconnected from your body. The sheer adrenaline flowing through my body was keeping me conscious as spurts of blood start shooting out of where my arm once was. Then my other arm was ripped off. I was starting to lose consciousness.

As im dangling from my legs, sounds of blood pattering against the ground, i hear an old man yell out “Hey! Stop that!”. The tree immediately lowered me back down onto the ground and scampered off into the trees. I tried getting back up normally but fell on my face when I realized i had no arms so i had to do some weird leg maneuver to get up. I proceeded to run back home. I never saw that man that saved my life. But where ever he is, i hope he’s living a happy life. Life since has been forever changed. I can only type with my nose. I had to learn how to make sandwiches with my nose. But its better this way, than being killed by a sentient tree.
