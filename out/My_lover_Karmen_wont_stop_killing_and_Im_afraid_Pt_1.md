“Mother, why did we even come here?”

I glared out of the car and glanced at my phone as the rain pelted our windows violently.

“Because dear,” one of the wheels interrupted with a loud screech, “you are ill. I thought the mountain air would do you good.”

I frowned. “I don’t want ‘the mountain air.’ I want Karmen!”

“We will cease talk of that creature from hell, right this instant! She has bewitched you and she is the reason you are so ill.”

I sighed and stared out the car window again. I ached for her. I needed her so, so badly.

“This is just a phase and you will grow out of it. If you don't cut this behavior out soon, I will arrange a marriage between you and Mr. Willhelm faster than you can even say the name of your bride of Satan.”

“Karmen…” I said softly to myself. 

I turned to her, “I'm not marrying Willhelm. I'll throw myself off a mountain before I marry that creep who’s been obsessed with me since I was a teenager.”

Mother huffed. “He’s a friend of your father and makes good money. He would be able to provide you with a comfortable life. Do you want to be a burden to your father and me forever? You're of marriageable age. It's time to let go of that… lesbionic delusion.”

I felt hot with rage. “Just because-” I felt the words die in my throat as I heard a voice.

“Don't argue with her. I will be with you again soon.”

It was Karmen. 

I turned away from mother and just stewed in rage.

“Lorelei, we’re here.”

I groaned and exited the carriage. Grandfather's butler nodded to me and took my belongings up into the castle.

As I walked inside and ascended the stairs to my room, I had to admit, the castle was beautiful. It had been in my family for over 100 years and one day, I hoped, it would belong to me. 

My bedroom was large and stately. It had a view overlooking the mountains, a red canopy bed, a hand-carved oak dresser, and a vibrant gold velvet reading chair. As much as I didn't want to be here, I couldn't deny that it was beautiful.

I flopped on the bed and spread my arms and legs out on the blanket like I was making a snow angel. I smiled to myself until I noticed a distinct smell on the blanket; blood.

I felt my breathing slow, “Karmen?”

When she didn't respond, I started to panic.

“Who did you kill?”

The room remained silent. 

“Karmen, please answer me! I could get in trouble if it's someone important. My family could get in trouble!”

I frantically tore back the sheets on my bed in an attempt to find the source of the blood smell. My fear intensified when I found nothing. 

I could feel myself sweat. Whatever Karmen did, I had a deep sense that I would be paying the price for it.

“Lorelei.”

I turned around instinctively before realizing the sound was coming from inside my head.

“I'm here.”

“Where?”

I felt myself breathing heavily. Why was Karmen scaring me like this?

She slid out from under the bed with a big smile on her face. “Hello, my love.”

I thought I was going to faint at the sight of her. The side of her mouth was caked in blood and her fangs were bared. 

I fell back on the bed in fear, too stunned to speak.

She laughed, “Oh, this is nothing.” She moved her hand over her face and all the blood vanished. 

She sat on the corner of the bed and leaned toward me, “You were calling for me, were you not?”

I felt my sweat intensify. “Y-yeah, you're right. I was.”

“Darling,” she moved towards me, “you know what I am.”

I paused, trying not to stammer. “Yes. I-I do. I uh, I guess I just never saw blood on your face, is all.”

I gulped and stared at her nervously. 

Karmen’s expression softened. “Don't be scared.” Her hand reached out to touch my face, “I would never hurt you.”

I nodded, perhaps too quickly. “Yes, I know.”

I stared into her large black eyes and felt myself relax. 

Karmen said she would never hurt me, so of course, she would never hurt me, right?

“I fear I've given you quite the fright, my love. And for that, I apologize. I think I should bid you adieu.”

Karmen leaned in and kissed me softly. 

“Goodnight Karmen.”

“Goodnight Lorelei. I shall see you tomorrow.”

And just as quickly as she appeared, she vanished.

I suddenly felt weak, as if I could faint at any moment. I lay on the bed and shut my eyes.

I awoke in the middle of the night to a scream. 

“Oh no.”

I ran down the stairs in search of the noise.

“Karmen, what did you do!”

I could have sworn I heard a soft laugh as I ran towards the front door.

I stopped on the last stair; there was a pool of blood on the floor.

“Karmen,” my voice broke, “this has to stop.”

I scanned the room for bodies, but there was nothing. 

I began to shake in fear and grasped onto the stair railing. What had I gotten myself into?

I breathed in and out until I felt calm enough to step around the puddle of blood.

As I followed the trail of blood, a tingle ran down my spine. I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me.

The trail of blood led me to the kitchen.

I covered my mouth when I saw the carnage.

The town police chief, the mayor, and the local detective were all gutted like pigs. 

“Karmen…”

I ran back up to mother’s room but when I opened the door, she was gone. 

I stared out the window, petrified with fear, “Karmen, what did you do?”

Again, she did not answer. I ran back to my room as fast as I could and shut the door.

I grabbed the Bible on my dresser and a pen. My hand shook as I wrote out all of the events of the evening on the introductory page. “To whoever sees this, please help me.”
