I didn’t do well with uncertainty. Uncertainty was an annoying little worm and no matter how hard I tried, it continued to wriggle in the grooves of my brain. It was both a help and a hindrance to my job. It made me dedicated, but it also made me obsessive. Gray was correct though, as much as I hated to admit it: It’s a cruel fact of life that not all loose ends get tied.

 

I knew I wouldn’t let it go, but I had to put it down. File it away. Detach. It was my first week in Greenwood, I had to remain focused on what I could control.

 

Toxicology would come back the next day and determine that there were no illicit drugs or alcohol in Melvin’s system. Only traces of over-the-counter painkillers, and prescription anti-depressants. Ruling out a bad drug trip. That was the only news we got. The rest of the day went on with little to no incident.

 

I clocked out and spent the approaching dusk roaming the town. Something I had been meaning to do. I moved here for a reason, after all.

 

It was nice. It was peaceful. The first time I got to see the town without my work eyes. As the sun set, I didn’t feel fear like I did in the city. I may have had years of self defense training, mace, and a gun, but walking around downtown Toronto alone at night was still a bad idea.

 

The rocky roads were lined with little mom and pop shops, churches, bingo halls, and B&Bs. There was a main street with all the big stores, your Walmarts, your Burger Kings, but this here was the real town. It was everything I wanted.

 

I got back home after nightfall and went straight to bed. Unfortunately, however, I wouldn’t be sleeping.

 

As I laid comfortable as can be, ready to drift off, my phone rang. I picked up hoping it was just some telemarketer, but no such luck. It was Gray.

 

“Where do you live? I’m picking you up.” He asked, as to-the-point as always.

 

“What?... Why?” I groggily answered.

 

“To go bowling, dumbass, what do you think? Get ready, I’m on my way.”

 

“Hang on... just give me a second.” I said, slowly sitting up and wiping my eyes.

 

“Cole, were you sleeping? It’s fucking 8:30 at night, what’s the matter with you? Are you 65?”

 

“God... I’ll text you the address.” I scoffed, hanging up on him. Instantly my night was so much worse.

 

I waited on the curb outside my building and within 10 minutes his shitty tan car parked in front of me. I hopped in.

 

“See this is why I didn’t want no partner. I could’ve just done this myself, but now I gotta pick up grandma.” He jabbed.

 

“Just... Tell me what the hell we’re doing.” I responded wearily.

 

“I got a call from our friend Evelyn.”

 

“Again? Look, I looked into everything earlier, the girl sells nudes online and she didn’t want her mom to know. That’s what the Paris trip was, that’s why she was being shady. I’d rather not be the one to have to break that information to her but I guess I’m gonna have to.”

 

“Well... Evelyn says a friend of hers saw Harmony walking around in the woods behind town an hour ago.”

 

My mood immediately shifted and I got a chill. How could that be possible? There had to be a mistake. I tried hard not to jump to conclusions.

 

We drove to the outskirts of town and parked on the dirt driveway of a quaint little farm.

 

“Stay in the car.” Ordered Gray.

 

“No.” I answered, stepping out. Gray rolled his eyes but didn’t protest further.

 

Gray made an effort to stand in front of me as we walked to the rickety door of the rickety house and knocked. Dogs barked and howled from the inside.

 

The door opened to an older lady. Likely in her 60s with wispy grey hair. She reprimanded her dogs and eventually they quieted down.

 

“How are you, ma’am? Nice to see ya again.” Gray greeted. Once the woman noticed me, she stared daggers.

 

“Got yerself a partner, do ya?” She asked with a callousness in her voice only outmatched by her country twang.

 

“Brand new, from the city. But don’t mind her. You know why I’m here, Evelyn says you called her about her daughter?”

 

“I seen her! Just now, ‘bout two hours ago. One o’ma goats went missing this afternoon so Henry and I went out lookin’ for ‘im. We went all around, didn’t see a damn thing. We was out there a few hours and I know with Henry’s hip he shouldn’t be out there that long but we’s can’t afford to lose another goat, not in this damn economy.”

 

“Ain’t that the truth.” Gray jumped in. He truly felt like a different person when he was talking to locals. A real social chameleon. I hated to admit I was impressed.

 

“So you went out to the woods then?” Gray said, attempting to steer her back on track.

 

“Was the last place we looked. Don’t know why a goat would wanna be in the woods, that ain’t the place for ‘em. But we went looking ‘round there anyways, and that’s when I seen Harmony. Evelyn was telling me the past few weeks ‘bout how she went to Paris and she thinks she went missing and all this. I wasn’t sure what to make of it all but I been prayin’ for her every night either way.”

 

“You saw her?” Gray interjected again. “You’re sure you saw her? What was she doing?”

 

“Wally, I SAW her clear as day. I don’t know what the hell she was doin’ but she was butt ass naked in them trees and as soon as she saw me lookin’ at her she ran off like a bat outta Jesus. No way was I gonna catch up to her, and we don’t go too deep in them woods as it is. Too easy to get lost in there. So we came back and I called Evelyn up first thing.”

 

“Of course, I understand.” Gray said, seemingly ready to exit the conversation.

 

“Sorry ma’am, excuse me.” I interjected, moving out from behind Gray. “You said you can’t lose ANOTHER goat... How many goats have you lost?”

 

Gray gave me a disapproving look and the old lady’s expression dropped to one of vitriol as she looked at me.

 

“Three. Tonight was the third in the past month ‘er so. Ol’ Leeroy’s lost a few as well.” She said coldly and concisely. If Gray had asked, I’m sure she would’ve gone on about her theory as to why that was. With me, I knew that was all I was getting, and I was fine with that.

 

“Thank you for your time, Helen.” Gray said.

 

“She’s a good kid, that Harmony. You find her. I don’t know what all she’s gotten herself into, but you find her.” Helen commanded before shutting the door.

 

Gray turned to me as we walked down the path, “Why do you have to speak?”

 

“It was good information to know.” I countered. “Not my fault she doesn’t seem to like me.”

 

“I think you just like pissing me off.”

 

A few smarmy answers to that came to mind, but I just chose to shrug instead.

 

I reached the car and began opening the passenger door but Gray cut me off.

 

“Whoa, what are you doin’?” He asked.

 

“What? Want me to drive?”

 

“We ain’t leaving. I’m just grabbing us some flashlights.”

 

“Oh... You wanna do this right now?”

 

“Yeah why not?”

 

“It’s pitch black out here.”

 

“Hence the flashlights, genius.”

 

“You don’t wanna call it in or anything? We don’t even have a report filed yet.”

 

“And what the hell would that report say? Senile old fart who’s more cataracts than human thinks she sees a missing girl who isn’t even missing? Besides, if any of what she said is true, whether that girl was our girl or not, there’s a naked girl running around in the woods. I don’t know what your hobbies are, but people don’t generally do that for fun. Whoever she is, she’s in trouble. Every second counts with this shit, so we’re going.”

 

Unfortunately, I had to give it to him again. I may hate his belligerent ass but he made sense. I didn’t protest. We got out a pair of flashlights and began our trek through the field behind the farm to the woods.

 

“So.” I spoke up as we walked. “She called you Wally.”

 

“Yeah, and?”

 

“Is your name Wally or not?”

 

“No. Nickname. Only for close friends.”

 

“Oh, she’s your friend then? That old lady?”

 

“Old ladies get a pass.”

 

“How do you know her?”

 

“Everybody knows everybody, Cole.”

 

“I see... So did the big apple just not want you anymore and they sent you off here, is that what it is?” I asked.

 

Gray chuckled. “Yeah whatever. I could ask you the same thing, Toronto.”

 

“I’m here by choice.”

 

“Well then you make very shit choices.”

 

“Yeah? So how are you here then?”

 

“By choice.” He answered frankly and with deliberate timing. Surprisingly enough, I laughed.

 

We made our way into the woods. Gray once again made sure to step in front of me. I wasn’t sure what his intention was by doing that, but it made it hard for me to see my surroundings past his large frame so I broke off to the side.

 

Visibility wasn’t much better either way. Despite these woods being so close to town, once you were in the thick of it, you got no residual light. You might as well have been a thousand miles away. The flashlight’s beam helped some but the harsh, jagged shadows it cast of all the trees and foliage made it difficult to discern anything. Part of me thought it might be better to turn the light off and just let my eyes adjust to the dark, but I decided against it.

 

“Police! Is there anybody out here? Does anyone need help?” Gray shouted into the wall of darkness. My animal brain didn’t love the idea of calling so much attention to ourselves in this dark and strange place, but it was the right call.

 

“So you’re thinking it’s definitely not our girl?” Gray asked in a somewhat hushed tone.

 

“I can’t say definitely, but I don’t understand how it possibly could be.” I answered.

 

“It’s weird shit...” He commented. It almost unnerved me to hear him admit that. I expected him to continue to be dismissive, but I could tell he could sense the same thing I did. That something was off about everything that’s been happening.

 

We continued making our way through the slender spires. Gray called out periodically asking if anyone was out there, but there was no response. Slowly we drifted apart to cover more ground, but never far enough away that we couldn’t see the others’ light.

 

We were out there for about an hour and neither of us saw any sign of anything.

 

“Five more minutes then I’m callin’ it.” Gray shouted to me.

 

“Yeah.” I turned and answered.

 

But as soon I turned back and shined my light over to the left of me... I saw.

 

I noticed the hand first. Clasping around the side of one of the trees a few yards away. Then I saw the face peeking out from behind. Only half of the face was visible, it wasn’t easy to make out... but it was her. I was almost certain of it. The same hair, the same face, the same everything. She was just staring at me.

 

I was stunned into silence but then I called out, “Harmony?”

 

Her face and hand disappeared behind the tree as soon as I spoke so I began running after her.

 

“Harmony! Wait! We’re here to help you! We’re the police!” I shouted. I heard Gray running in my direction as well.

 

“Cole, you saw her!?” He yelled.

 

“She’s here but she ran!” I answered.

 

“Hey Harmony!” Gray shouted. “Your mother’s worried about you okay? We just wanna bring you home safe! You’re not in any trouble!” I could hear him huffing and puffing as he tried to catch up to me.

 

“Shit!” I exclaimed. “I don’t see her! I don’t know where she went!”

 

“Ease up, Cole! For god’s sake!”

 

I begrudgingly stopped running and let him catch up.

 

“You fuckin’ scared her off. Why’d you just run at her?” Gray scolded.

 

“She ran before I ran. As soon as I saw her looking at me, she ran.”

 

“Shit... Are you certain that it was her? It was Harmony?”

 

“I... I’m pretty sure.”

 

“You’re PRETTY sure?”

 

“She was far away and I only saw part of her face but... It REALLY looked like her.”

 

“Alright... Here’s what we’re gonna-“ Gray began to speak but cut himself off. I saw his eyes widen as he looked towards the ground.

 

“The fuck?” He exclaimed. I looked down to the center of his light and there laid a tiny pool of deep red liquid, sitting upon some dead leaves. I noticed more droplets next to it. Our flashlights followed the droplets and sure enough it began a trail.

 

“Was she bleeding?” Gray asked.

 

“Not that I could see.”

 

We followed the trail. It was a mostly straight line. After a few yards the trail stopped at a much larger pool of crimson.

 

As I focused on the pool, I saw Gray’s light slowly move upwards.

 

“Fuck.” He muttered slowly in a tone I had not yet heard from him. One of deep unease. I once again followed the beam of his light to see what he saw, and when I saw it, it felt like all of the air was sucked out of my lungs.

 

I suspected that we had discovered one of the old lady’s missing goats. At least, its head. It was hanging from a tree branch, severed at the neck. Strewn up by its horns.

 

“What the fuck is this?” Gray asked in that same uneasy and dumbfounded tone.

 

I had no words to speak. I could only stare in disbelief at this ungodly exhibit.

 

“Jesus.” Gray remarked again, now looking towards the trees. I took them in at the same time.

 

Carvings. On almost every tree surrounding the goat. Some recognizable symbols, some not. Various assortments and configurations of triangles, simplistic eyes, crosses. I was unfamiliar with the meaning of them... But the pentagrams, those were clear as day.

 

As if the sacrificial goat wasn’t enough to convince me this was satanic.

 

I turned my gaze back to the goat’s head. As I looked closer I only ended up noticing more things that made me deeply uncomfortable.

 

One of the goat’s eyes was missing. It didn’t look like it was shot out, it looked like it was removed. Why? Some kind of ritualistic significance? I couldn’t understand it. But there was one detail that was maybe even stranger.

 

There were odd little smears and clumps of something matted into its fur. Pale yellow-ish and opaque. Only a couple of them, but enough to notice. Some of it looked like it was dripping, but it was hardened and smooth like refrigerated butter. I got up a little bit closer and I could see what it was. I could even smell what it was, beyond the iron of the blood. But I didn’t have the faintest idea of why it would be here.

 

It was candle wax.
