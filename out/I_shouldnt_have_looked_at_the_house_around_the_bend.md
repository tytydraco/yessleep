It’s crazy to be writing this, I’ve always read stories like this and thought they were complete bullshit until I saw something I can’t deny is other worldly. 

For context I’m in my second year of college in a rural town, name omitted for obvious privacy reasons, but I’ve lived in this town for years and nothing has ever changed. My commute to school and work are the exact same, and the sights I see are the exact same; until a couple of days ago.

My usual drive is pretty, it’s along a type of county road that we call farm to market whatever number. I live in the sticks so most of what I see are dense walls of pine trees and other plants covering both sides of the road, with clearings and fields dotted to the left and right every so often, and large power lines cutting through the forest like a kneaded eraser to a charcoal drawing. 

There’s about 6 houses before I reach my own, as I said I live in the sticks. Im used to passing a ranch on my left, a small brown brick house, large field, full of cows. Then on the right a fracking pad that really pisses me off since I hate the sand trucks and other 18 wheelers that take up the whole damn road, after that a small one bedroom looking trailer home that I always confuse for the last house on my drive. But after that trailer home is an old abandoned house on the right side of the road. 

The house lies within a large curve, it’s almost contained within it if that makes sense. It’s old to me because it’s sat within the curve for as long as I can remember, 16 years to be precise, the amount of time I’ve lived here. The house itself I assume was 2 stories, I can’t really tell since it fell in upon itself, with the first floor almost swallowing the second. Whenever I drive by I can’t get a good read on the color, some days it’s a sickly blue and others a pale white, the roof is the same, sometimes a muted, almost dry red shingle, and other times black overrun with moss and what seems to be a slick green algae color. The house never really caught my eye over the last 16 years since I’ve always viewed it as normal, the only time I’ve questioned it was when I asked my stepdad why they didn’t just tear it down, without looking at me he said that the owner keeps it there to lower his property tax on the rest of his land, and ever since then I’ve never questioned the house.

That was true up until about a week ago. I was driving home from work when I noticed the trees were bent in a strange way. Normally they droop lazily over the edges of the road, but the trees surrounding the house on the curve were pulled away unnaturally, their branches jutted up and down randomly, many times in opposite directions of where the sun would normally shine, its as if they were scared, trying to run away. The same was true with the grass that normally overran the porch and the sides of the house that had fallen low enough, instead of hiding whatever was left in the house, it was pulled away too, leaving at least a foot of dirt around the house, and even then the grass was slanted away just like the tree branches. 

At the time I dismissed it; some rednecks kids probably came over and swung on the branches and tore up the grass but then the next day something else changed. The roof was lifted. Normally it sat limply on top, like a wet napkin on top of a glass. Only one home poking through, assembly something feel onto the rotting roof and punctured the shingles, but this time the roof was almost inflated, like someone stuck a big ballon into the living room, the hole was still there but it was more oval shaped now, with shards of shingles lining the sides, almost like teeth. Strangest of all, there were windows on the roof now, there must have been a second floor; the strangest thing about the windows though is, they were broken in such a way it seemed as if the holes in the glass served as pupils for the house itself. Gazing into the woods to the right. 

The next day was just as bizarre, nothing had drastically changed, but the holes in the newly shown roof windows now faced the road, which confused me to no end as I swore the day before they weren’t broken in those spots. 

The day after that I questioned my sanity, as I swore the house was closer to the road, not by much, just a few feet from what I could tell. But nonetheless it freaked me out.  I had to stop and investigate, I felt like someone was fucking with me, but no one could do something like this could they? 

I parked my car on the left side of the road and just stared. Again I swear the holes in the windows moved, this time to face me, it was chilling. I shuttered and at that moment a portion of the wall crumbled further and exposed a metal box sitting on a table in the living room. I ignored it, maybe it was the wind finally toppling the rotting wood siding of the house, but it happened again, this time more wall fell and a safe was exposed, I ignored it yet again and this time a loud rumble rang out as more of the roof collapsed, exposing a new looking tv.

At that moment I knew that house wasn’t normal. It knew I was looking at it, it knew I was watching it, and it was watching me. It wanted me to enter it, it was tempting me with items it thought would peak my curiosity, and at that moment I felt true fear. I started my car frantically, and sped away faster than I’ve ever driven down road. A loud bellowing crash emanated from behind me, I didn’t dare look back.  I didn’t sleep much that night, I couldn’t get the image of that house, that THING out of my head. For the first time in years I saw that thing for what it truly was; evil, all my life I’ve lived near that THING and I knew that I could never stop there again. 

The next day I drove a different way to work, but I decided to drive the normal way home, hoping that I would find the house back to normal, and I could write everything off as some crazy idea I dreamed up on a boring drive home, but to my horror it was gone. The house on the curve was gone. I was chilled to my core, and I drove home cautiously, checking every clearing in fear of this monster id attracted. Once I got home I calmed down a little, I made dinner and went to bed, peering into my backyard cautiously. It was empty. As I laid in bed I told myself the owner of the land must have tore it down, that’s what I heard as I sped away the night before and that’s why I didn’t see the house today they finished the demolition while I was at work. That line of thinking calmed me down, and I was able to sleep.

When I woke up the next morning I looked into the backyard again, and I almost fell to my knees in shock and fear. The house was there. It was in my yard, and it was staring at me. I stood there frozen for a second, until its front door swung open, as if it were taunting me. After that I grabbed my wallet, my keys, and threw on my shoes. I got in my car and drove. I left everything, I didn’t pay the mortgage that month or ever again. I left my life behind in fear of that thing. 

As I sit in my apartment I only hope it home I abandoned didn’t become something like that, I don’t know how it could, but I don’t care I’m still afraid. I never want to see that thing again. Currently I’m living in the furthest and largest city I could get to, in the highest apartment I could find. I never leave this concrete jungle in fear of what I saw in the woods. My only advice to whoever reads this is keep your eyes on the road and pay no attention to anything on the sides of the road, especially those hidden by the curves.
