If anyone ever found out what I do, they’d say I’ve got the worst job in the world. They’d be wrong. I don’t think about it like that. I think about keeping you, keeping us from going over a cliff. Like a field where weeds pop up, and my job is to yank them before they spread and choke everything else out. That’s how I tell it to myself, anyway.

I call it weeding. Or pruning. I’m not telling you how. Don’t ask. That part, if it gets in your head, you don’t sleep. Trust me. I don’t. I don’t want that on you.

What I can say: I meet the weeds on the first night. Bracelet ink still wet. Sometimes the name isn’t even decided yet. I go early, because early is easy. Easier than later. That’s how this works.

I don’t work alone. There’s this voice, the Messenger. He never yells. He shows up quiet. Bells so soft you’re not even sure you heard ’em. Little whiff of candle wax. Cheap glass in the hall leaking a bit of color, even with the lights off. Coin in my pocket gets warm, just a touch. That’s how I know he’s around.

He never gives me names. He gives me roles, like titles in some weird old book: Butcher-King. Plague Mouth. Fire Shepherd. Bomb Prophet. He tells me what that weed turns into if I don’t do my job, and what that person does to everyone else.

I keep a notebook. A ledger. I write the role, and then I write what didn’t happen after me. Stuff like:

Butcher-King: “Roundups by twenty-eight. Thousands locked in basements, whole stadiums packed, names on lists. People gone.” (Didn’t happen.)

Bomb Prophet: “Markets and buses, twelve cities in five years.” (Didn’t happen.)

Fire Shepherd: “Hymns in arenas, then bonfires, then ash. Flags for thirty winters.” (Didn’t happen.)

Plague Mouth: “Miracle clinics. Cameras love him. Year six: new fever, homemade.” (Didn’t happen.)

These aren’t storms. People did those in the lines he gave me. And I stopped those people, weeds, before they could stand. That was the deal. Call me what you want. Like I said, I called it pruning.

Before this, my life was just wreckage, bad choices, bad years, nothing holding me up. Now I get it, all that crap was just training, toughening me up for this, and I swear, I feel blessed, like I finally landed on the one thing I was born to do.

Once, between jobs, I asked him if there’s a place for me after. I didn’t say “heaven,” or something like that, but yeah, that’s what I meant. He said, “Where the blinding light casts no shadows, and you are home, at peace.” Kinda foggy line, but I took it like a promise. You do ugly work, you get a quiet room after. That was the bargain in my head.

I do nights. Hospitals. I can hear the second right before a room turns bad… don’t know how to explain it, I just hear it. Combat medic before all this. My ears learned things.

Protocol is simple: I call, he confirms, I do the correction. That’s all you’re getting about methods.

Last night was different.

Building’s quiet, heavy quiet. Maternity floor. Chapel door closed like always, but the hallway smells like someone just did a service, incense with the lights off.

Then he comes on. Bells sink through the building like water. Coin warms up. My pulse goes flat, the good kind, like I’ve been sitting for an hour.

“Severe,” he says. That word from him is a stamp. No arguing.

“Role?” I say. Ledger needs it.

“False Healer. Crowd-binder. Soft tyrant.”

“Soft tyrant” is the worst kind. Not boots. Not flags. It’s smiles and “please” and next thing you know you’re giving them the keys because it feels nice. You’ve seen it.

I get into the room the usual way. Not magic. You walk like you belong, most doors say okay. People look past you if you let them.

Parents look lit from inside. Not exactly happy. More like… full. Nurses keep finding reasons to hang around. A cleaner I don’t know is humming four notes super soft. The whole room is breathing on the same beat. If you ever felt a room do that, you know. It makes your shoulders drop.

I put my hand on the bed rail and my left-hand shake, the shake I’ve had since a bad winter, just stops. Like a switch. The wrist stops hurting too. I don’t like needing anything, but I’m not gonna lie: felt good. Like someone finally turned off a fan that’s been on in your head for years.

I don’t look at the weed first. I check the monitor, the window, the hands in the room. Then I ask him for a measure. He doesn’t always give one. This time he says, “Three winters. Seven cities. One border.” His voice has that bell sound in it again. It’s pretty. I hate that it’s pretty.

I stall. Say I gotta check something. Step into the hall. The color rings from the stained glass are sliding on the floor like they wanna make letters, but they don’t. You know that screensaver with the DVD logo that never hits the corner? Like that. Annoying.

I put my ear to the chapel door. No hymn. Under it, a low machine hum. Field tent sound. Generators. Bad radios. I pop the lock. Most locks are just… you show them you’re serious and they quit.

Inside. Not holy. Fake. Bell shells, no clappers. Candles… glass tubes. The ‘altar’? A warm box. I put the coin on it. It sticks. Not a magnet, like it recognizes it. My gut flips. I want to kick it over. ‘This is what you’ve been running me with?’

I smack the bells. Tin crash. Under it: click-click, hiss, that 3 a.m. numbers station on a junk radio.

“Severe,” he says again, in my head. Same word. Different… bottom voice to it now.

“Role,” I say, because habit is stupid strong.

“False Healer. Crowd-binder. Soft tyrant.”

“Yeah,” I say. “Shut up a second.”

I don’t even know why I said it. The place looked like a mall Santa set for church, you know? And the coin sticking like that made me feel tagged. Like a dog with a chip.

He doesn’t get mad. He never does. He’s calm. That’s his thing. Calm voice, church smell, nice words. He talks while he’s taking something.

“Talk straight,” I say. “No church stuff. What are you.”

He goes quiet. Then, same calm voice: “Confirm.”

“Say something real,” I tell him.

He says, “Where the blinding light casts no shadows, and you are home.”

That’s when I lose it.

“No,” I say, and I’m yelling now. I hit the bell shells, tin rattle, kick the hot box. I grab the coin, it burns my fingers. “You’re not a messenger. You’re a handler. You ran me. You fucking made me pull weeds. Who are you? What are you? Say it. Say something.”

The clicking jumps, fast, like a busted radio. The color smears once and cuts off. Wax smell gone. Coin goes cold. The hum dies like a plug got yanked.

Nothing.

He’s gone.

I run.

Out the fake chapel. Down the stairs. Past the snack machines. Past the sleepy guard. Out the side door into wet air. Sky’s empty.

No plan. Just legs.

Street. Another street. Alley. Fence. Bang my knee. Keep going.

The ledger hits my thigh every step. Heavy.

The fuck just happened?

Who put me in this?

Why me?

What did I do… what the fuck did I do?

I stop under a dead streetlight. Can’t breathe right. Sweat slick and cold under my shirt. Hands shaking again. Wrist hurts again. Heart kicks, then trips. Mouth tastes like rust water. Fine. Real. Fuck that.

I look back at the hospital. Dark windows. No color. No bells. Just my breath sawing like a busted fan.

I don’t open the ledger. It’s a brick on my thigh and I’m not strong right now.

I called them weeds so I could pull them.

But what if they weren’t weeds?
