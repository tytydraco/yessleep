It started as a feeling, that sense of being watched. But as I walked through the rain-soaked streets, it became more tangible. I’d catch glimpses of a shadow lurking in the corners of my vision, always just out of reach. The figure followed me, its presence heavy, like a weight pressing against my chest.

I weaved through alleyways and side streets, trying to shake the feeling, but the figure remained. It was as if the city itself had conspired to lead me straight into his path. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I half-expected him to disappear, but he never did.

One evening, after picking up a new round of prescriptions for my father, I spotted the figure again—this time more clearly. He stood in a dingy alley across the street, just watching. A flash of a memory hit me, but I couldn’t place it fast enough. I couldn’t remember where I had seen him before.

Frustrated, and tired of running, I marched toward the alley, ready to confront this shadow that had been haunting me. But as soon as I got close, the figure vanished. It was like he’d dissolved into the subway fog, leaving me standing there in the rain, completely alone.

I stood there, drenched and fuming. The alley was empty, no sign that anyone had ever been there. Had I imagined it? Was I losing my grip on reality?

As I turned and walked away, I had to ask myself again, had the figure even been real? Or was it just another manifestation of my unravelling mind?

The next morning, I woke with the remnants of a vivid dream lingering in my mind. In it I stood outside a suburban house with a white picket fence. It was almost picture-perfect—except for the overwhelming sense of dread that had gripped me in the dream. The yellow door stood out, as bright as a beacon.

As I moved through my morning routine, the image of the house burned itself into my mind. I couldn’t shake it. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, even as I cared for my father. The house, with its pristine fence and yellow door, called to me.

I had to find it. Something was waiting for me there. Something I had to uncover.

In a rare moment of respite, I found myself standing in front of the TV, hoping for a distraction. The usual noise of the news droned on, a background hum to my thoughts. 

But then, something caught my attention. The news anchor’s voice crackled through the speakers, describing a heartwarming feature story. My pulse quickened as the image filled the screen. It was the house. The same one that had haunted my dreams. White picket fence, and that unmistakable yellow door.

My heart pounded in my chest. I couldn’t ignore the feeling that this house held some key to the mysteries swirling in my life. Without hesitation, I grabbed a pen, jotted down the address, and left my apartment, drawn by a force I couldn’t explain.

The subway ride felt like an eternity. I barely noticed the usual clamor of the city—my mind was fixed on the house, its yellow door looming larger in my imagination with each passing minute. When I finally stepped off the train, the air was different. Clean. Crisp. The scent of freshly cut grass replaced the smog of the city. I had arrived in the suburbs.

Everything here seemed too perfect—manicured lawns, gleaming fences, houses with neatly painted shutters. The whole block exuded a sort of tranquility that felt foreign to me. Yet, as I walked deeper into the neighborhood, an eerie stillness settled over the street. No children playing. No dogs barking. Just silence. Too much silence.

The quiet unnerved me. It was as if the entire neighborhood had slipped into some kind of suspended animation. Curtains were drawn tight, doors locked, and the normally lively suburban streets were deserted. The absence of life weighed on me, making each step feel heavier.

Finally, I arrived at the house from my dream. There it stood in all its unnerving familiarity—the same yellow door, bright against the dull grey sky. My hands trembled as I approached. Should I knock? What if someone was home? Or worse, what if the answers I sought were more than I was ready to uncover?

I knocked, the sound loud and intrusive in the unnatural stillness. The seconds stretched on, each one ticking away like an eternity. No response. I swallowed hard, the knot in my stomach growing tighter. Instinct urged me forward, pushing me to the backyard, as if the house itself was guiding me.

The backyard was overgrown, yet still eerily serene. In one corner, half hidden by tangled weeds, stood an old moss-covered statue. Something about it pulled me closer. I crouched down and, on impulse, lifted its stone base. Nestled beneath it was a key. Not just any key, but one with a familiar dot of red paint on its head.

My fingers trembled as I held the key. This wasn’t a coincidence. It was the same mark as the key I’d found before, the one that kept reappearing. My pulse quickened as I approached the door. Every part of me screamed that I knew this place, knew it from deep inside my mind—but how?

With a deep breath, I slid the key into the lock. The door opened with a soft creak, and I stood on the threshold, staring into the dim interior of the house. This was the boundary—the line between the life I knew and the answers I had been chasing. I crossed it.

The inside of the house was as quiet as the outside, steeped in the same heavy, unsettling stillness. Dust floated in the sunlight that filtered through closed curtains. I moved down the hallway, peeking into each room. Everything was in its place, as though the people who lived here had only just left. But no one was home.

As I ventured further, the sense of unease grew stronger. The house felt lived in—there were signs of everyday life, but everything was frozen in time. I could almost hear the laughter, the conversations, feel the warmth of a life that once existed here. But I couldn't make sense of it. Who were these people? What did they have to do with me?

In the study, my eyes fell on a cluttered desk, covered with papers, old photos, and journals. One journal caught my eye—its cover worn and weathered with age. I opened it carefully and flipped through the pages. The handwriting was neat but faded, each word marked into the paper like a map of someone’s thoughts, someone’s life.

The entries were fragmented, disjointed, but there was a pattern. A story was being told, but I couldn’t quite piece it together. Something about loss, about regret. And then I saw it—the same yellow door, sketched in the margins of the journal.

This house, these people, they were connected to me in ways I couldn’t yet understand.

As I closed the journal, paranoia prickled at the back of my mind. What if the owner of the house returned? What if I had been seen? The house had led me here, to this point, but for what reason?

I stood in the middle of the study, surrounded by the remnants of a life that felt a million miles away from my own, yet inexplicably linked to me. What was I meant to find here? What truth was buried in these walls?

The house remained silent, holding its secrets just out of my reach. I knew I had only scratched the surface. Something bigger, something darker was waiting for me. But for now, all I had were more questions.

I was about to leave when a resounding knock echoed through the house. My entire body froze, my pulse spiking as I waited for a second knock. And there it was, confirming my suspicion. The sound seemed to call me, pulling me deeper into the house.

Cautiously, I followed the rhythmic knocks, their steady beat guiding me toward a walk-in wardrobe tucked away in the corner of the master bedroom. I slowly pushed the door open. A dark, narrow space greeted me, barely illuminated.

The knocks grew louder as I stepped inside, now coming from behind a rack of clothes. I carefully parted the hanging garments, revealing a hidden door embedded in the wall. I stood there for a moment, questioning if I really wanted to know what was beyond that door.

Swallowing my fear, I twisted the knob and pushed. A flight of stairs stretched downward, disappearing into darkness. Each step I took creaked beneath me, the anticipation building with every footfall.

I reached another door, its surface worn, as if time had taken its toll. My hand shook as it hovered over the knob, nerves buzzing under my skin. With a deep breath, I turned it and slowly pushed the door open.

A small room met me. Bleak, retro wallpaper clung to the walls, and a row of monitors cast an eerie light over everything. My eyes were instantly drawn to a figure seated in front of the monitors, his back turned to me.

It was him. The Watcher. His long hair fell over his shoulders, just like I remembered. He was sharpening something—a tool, maybe—with that same methodical, rasping sound I’d heard before.

For a split second, he didn’t notice me. Time seemed to hang in the air. But then, his head whipped around. His eyes locked on mine, cold and terrifying.

Panic surged through me. Without thinking, I bolted. I didn’t wait for him to move, didn’t wait to see what he would do. I just ran. My legs carried me up the stairs, through the bedroom, my breath ragged and loud in my ears. I couldn’t shake the image of him, the feeling of his eyes burning into my back.

I didn’t stop until I burst through the front door, out into the empty street. I didn’t dare look back, certain he was still watching me, following me with his gaze.

I ran. The once calm, quiet neighborhood now felt menacing, its silence suffocating. My sneakers hit the pavement hard as I pushed myself farther and farther away from that house.

Only when I was safely out of sight, far from the reach of that house and The Watcher, did I slow down. Leaning against a lamppost, I gasped for air, my heart pounding. My mind was a whirlwind of fear, questions, and the haunting memory of that room.

I don’t know how long I stood there before I finally made my way back into the city, back to the one place that always gave me comfort—the bar. I stepped inside, the atmosphere familiar, comforting. For a moment, I felt like I could breathe again.

I slid onto a stool at the bar, and almost immediately, a woman approached me with a warm smile. Her eyes sparkled with a strange kind of recognition.

"Steve! It’s been a few days," she said, her voice filled with warmth.

I blinked at her, my mind scrambling to place her face. But nothing came. I couldn’t remember her. Not her name, not her face—nothing.

"I'm sorry," I said, trying to smile, though I knew it probably looked forced. "Are you new here?"

Her smile faltered for a moment, concern flickering in her eyes. She reached out and gently touched my arm. "It’s me, Steve. It’s Maggie."

My heart sunk. No. It couldn’t be. This wasn’t my Maggie. My Maggie had different hair, a different face—a completely different presence. She was my anchor, the one constant in this disorienting world.

I searched the woman’s face, desperate for any spark of recognition. But nothing came. "I’m sorry," I whispered, barely able to meet her eyes. "You must have me confused with someone else. I don’t know who you think I am."

Her smile faded completely, replaced by sadness. She pulled her hand away. "I understand," she said softly, almost to herself. "I thought... Well, never mind."

She turned and walked away, leaving me there to wrestle with the strange, unsettling encounter. I watched her disappear into the crowd, but the unease lingered. Was I losing more of my memories? Were new ones replacing them without me even realizing?

The noise of the bar resumed, but the warmth I’d always felt here was gone. It felt cold. Empty. I glanced at the painting behind the bar, hoping for some sense of familiarity, but it wasn’t the same one I remembered. It had been replaced by an image of a large bridge towering over a dark harbour.

I downed the rest of my drink and stepped back into the night.

Later, as I stood by the window of my apartment, gazing out over the city, I couldn’t shake the weight pressing down on me. My mind felt scrambled, everything inside me fractured, scattered.

I didn’t know who I could trust anymore. Not even myself.

And then, amidst the sea of shadows, I caught a flicker of movement. My gaze locked onto a figure standing in the window of the building across from me. The Watcher. The same presence that had stalked my every step, haunted my every move.

His stare bored in to me. Time seemed to stretch as our eyes met, the air between us thick with a strange, piercing intensity.

Why was he following me? Was he a guardian, a sign of impending danger, or just a figment of my unravelling mind?

But tonight, there was no mistaking it—he was real. He stood there, his presence undeniable in the stillness of the night. Something deep inside me snapped. I couldn’t keep running. It was time to turn the tables, time to confront this enigma and rip the truth from his cold, unblinking gaze.

I left my apartment without a second thought, descending the stairwell. The streets below were dark and silent—eerily silent, like the city itself was holding its breath. I crossed the street, heading for the building where The Watcher had stood, my resolve firm.

As I stepped into the lobby, I paused. The calm before a storm. The warmth of the lobby felt wrong, almost out of place, given the emptiness that surrounded me. It was unsettling—minutes ago, the hotel had seemed alive, but now it was deserted, silent, as if everyone had simply vanished.

I stood in the centre of the room, the flickering light above casting long, jagged shadows along the walls. Doubt clawed at me, but before I could turn back, a sound broke through the silence—a faint ding. My head snapped toward the elevator just as the doors slid open, revealing the silhouette of a dark figure.

The Watcher had arrived.

Everything seemed to slow as he stepped out, his presence instantly filling the room. My muscles tensed, every instinct screaming at me to run, but I was frozen. The confrontation I had sought was here, and it was too late to escape.

His eyes locked onto mine, unflinching, unwavering. He moved toward me with heavy steps, slow and methodical, his approach terrifying in its calmness. The closer he came, the more familiar his features became, tugging at something deep within my memory. There was something about him—something I should recognize, but I couldn’t grasp it.

When he finally stood just inches from me, the tension between us was unbearable.

A surge of energy shot through me, nerves scrambling my thoughts.

“Who are you?” I managed, my voice barely holding steady. “What do you want from me?”

His lips curled into a smile, cold and chilling, his eyes gleaming with dark amusement.

“Why don’t we sit?” he murmured, his voice low and smooth.

Without knowing why, I followed him. We settled into large chairs, facing each other in the quiet, empty lobby. The Watcher’s gaze never wavered, those eyes of his seeming to see through every layer of me.

“You seem like you’ve had a long day,” he finally said, his voice calm.

I swallowed hard, my throat tight, as I nodded. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from his face.

“I couldn’t help but notice,” he continued, his voice laced with curiosity, “you seem a bit... lost.”

His words sinking in, I frowned, confused. How could he possibly know what was going on inside my head?

“I have a proposition for you, Steve,” he said.

My heart skipped a beat. How did he know my name?

“How do you—how do you know who I am?” I asked, my voice cracking under the weight of my own confusion.

His smile widened, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Let’s just say I know more than most,” he replied, his tone maddeningly cryptic.

I leaned back in my chair, trying to put some distance between us, even though I knew it wouldn’t help.

“What is it you want me to do?” I finally asked.

The Watcher leaned in, his voice low as he made his request.

"I need you to find someone for me," he said. "And I need you to do it discreetly."

Questions swirled in my mind, but before I could ask, he slid a small envelope across the table, his eyes never leaving mine.

"I need you to find this man," he explained. "And once you find what I’m looking for, I’ll give you what you’ve been searching for."

I reached for the envelope, fingers shook as they closed around it tightly. I studied him, searching for any sign of deception.

"How do I know I can trust you?" I asked. "How do I know this isn’t some kind of trap?"

The Watcher leaned back, almost as if he’d expected my doubt.

"You’ll have to trust your instincts, Steve."

His words echoed inside me. With a deep breath, I tore open the envelope and pulled out its contents—a single photograph. I stared at the image in disbelief.

It was a picture of me.

I sat there, frozen, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. My mind scrambled for an explanation as I finally looked up, meeting the Watcher's gaze.

"What is this?" I asked, my voice hoarse. "This is... me."

The Watcher leaned forward, his expression serious.

"Steve, I know this is hard to accept, but the truth is... you’re not fully awake. You’re in a coma."

His words echoed through my mind, colliding with everything I thought I knew.

"A coma?" I repeated, my voice shaky, disbelief flooding every word.

The Watcher nodded, his tone calm and assured. "Yes. In order to wake you up, I created this construct—this world you’re living in—to disrupt the intricate reality your mind has built. Everything here—every person, every place, every memory—is designed to keep you asleep. I’m here to bring you back."

Denial surged within me, followed by fear and a flicker of hope. My mind trying to make sense of what he was saying. Could this be true?

"Why?" I asked. "Why go to such lengths?"

He leaned back, his eyes steady on mine. "I am your doctor," he said. "This construct, this treatment, is my attempt to wake you. It’s the only way to bring you out of the coma and back to consciousness."

I stared at him, the pieces of the puzzle slowly clicking into place. The gaps in my memories, the strangeness of the world around me—it all started to make sense. I had been trapped in my own mind, lost in a reality of my own making.

"But I can’t do this alone," the Watcher continued, his voice soft but firm. "You have to trust me, Steve. Trust that I’m trying to help you. Follow my guidance, and we can navigate through this construct together. We’ll find a way to bring you back to the real world."

"Prove it," I muttered. "Prove that I’m in a coma."

The Watcher sighed, leaning forward slightly. "Okay, Steve. What’s your father’s name?"

I opened my mouth to answer, but no words came out. Panic welled up inside me. What was my father’s name? I tried to reach for it, but there was nothing—just an empty void.

A wave of vulnerability washed over me, and for the first time, I truly felt lost.

The Watcher's gaze softened. "There are people waiting for you, Steve," he said gently. "People who care about you. Your family, your loved ones—they’re waiting for you to come back. This journey isn’t just for you. It’s for them too."

My breath slowed, though my mind still swirled. "What do I need to do?" I asked, my voice firm despite the confusion still gnawing at me.

The Watcher’s smile widened slightly, just enough to be reassuring.

"You have to seek out the truth hidden in this world," he said. "Every person you met, every step you took—it’s all part of the puzzle that will lead you to waking up."

I nodded, a part of me desperate to believe, knowing I had to face my fears if I was ever going to wake from this permanent dream.

"I'm ready," I said. Determination flared in my eyes as I flipped the photo over. An address was scribbled on the back.

The Watcher gave a nod of approval.

"Remember, trust your instincts. The path may seem uncertain, but you must rely on your intuition to discern the constructs from reality. It’s all part of the process."

Suddenly, I felt droplets of water hit the photo. I looked up, and in a blink, I found myself at the foot of the bridge—the one that had haunted my thoughts for so long. It loomed ahead, a massive structure stretching into the unknown.

Everything inside me urged me to move forward, to step into the uncharted territory beyond. Yet, I felt trapped, weighed down by invisible chains of doubt and anxiety. My eyes stayed locked on the misty horizon where the bridge vanished into nothingness.

Time slowed. The very ground beneath me seemed to pulse with the rhythm of my anxiety.

But then, I forced myself to take a hesitant step forward. The bridge felt solid, yet unstable, beneath my feet, like walking on a tightrope above an abyss of fear. Memories swirled in my mind—were they real, or even mine?

After a few steps, I faltered, stopped by a wall of fear. The bridge became a mirror, reflecting every insecurity, every ghost that haunted me. I clenched my muscles, pushing forward despite it all.

Doubt gnawed at me, fear twisted in my gut, but somewhere deep inside, a spark of determination kept me moving. The bridge seemed endless, a never-ending path. I closed my eyes briefly, searching for calm within the darkness. 

I opened my eyes again, and there, in the mist, stood a figure. A silhouette. Each step brought it into sharper focus until I recognized it—another vision guide, like the ones that had accompanied me before. Not a man, but a manifestation of my own mind, leading me forward.

Realization hit me. This was part of the test. A piece of myself guiding me through. I had been here before. Understanding washed over me, unlocking the meaning of this journey.

The end of the bridge was within sight now, close enough to reach. A new clarity settled over me. The fear that had paralyzed me was no longer a wall—it was a challenge to overcome.

With every ounce of courage I could summon, I took deliberate steps forward. Each one echoed with a sense of purpose, a declaration that I was willing to face whatever lay ahead. The bridge creaked beneath me, but I didn’t care anymore.

I moved steadily, the distance between me and my destination closing with each step. What once seemed impossible now felt conquerable.

Finally, I reached the other side, and exhilaration rushed through me. I had faced the fear that had held me back for so long. I turned, looking back at the bridge I had crossed.

And then, something unexpected—there, in the middle of a quiet, empty road, stood a door. It was mysterious, out of place, yet it beckoned me forward, like a beacon in the silent town.

Taking a deep breath, I approached the door, my hand reaching for the handle. It was locked.

I instinctively reached into my pocket, pulling out the key that had followed me on this journey. Sliding it into the lock, I turned it. The door clicked open, revealing a dark void beyond.

I stepped through, my senses alive with anticipation. As I crossed the threshold, the bridge disappeared behind me, and I found myself inside a building. The transition was seamless, as if I had always been here.

The space stretched endlessly, dimly lit offices and corridors extending in every direction. The walls were lined with faded paintings and family photos, capturing memories.

I moved deeper into the building, sensing a shift in the atmosphere. A door stood slightly ajar ahead of me. Intrigued, I approached and gently pushed it open.

Inside, the room was bathed in a soft, golden light, warm and comforting, a stark contrast to the cold emptiness I had endured for so long. I scanned the space—shelves lined with old books, a vintage typewriter on a desk, and an ornate mirror that reflected back at me more clearly than anything I’d ever seen.

Through the window, I could see a beach, so close I could almost feel the sand beneath my feet.

Then, at the heart of the room, I saw it—a key lying on the desk beside a pile of papers. I stepped closer, my eyes drawn to the key. As I reached for it, I noticed a small dab of green nail polish on the surface. I froze.

The moment my fingers touched the key, the room began to shake. Light erupted from every corner, growing brighter, more intense. The walls trembled, the air hummed with an electric energy.

But I didn’t flinch. For once, I wasn’t afraid. The light grew blinding, impossibly bright, and a smile crept onto my face.

What's that beeping?

And then—
