My dad lost his job and mom got demoted, but they didn't want to give up on our annual vacation so we went to a town on the coast called Oblith.

It was primarily a fishing town and smelled of fish guts.

The water was cold.

The beach was rocky and mossy and filled with long, stringy plants that the sea had regurgitated.

In our motel, for the first few minutes the water from the faucets ran rust red and tasted like iron, facts which the manager explained as “actually beneficial to you” and “a natural product of the local soil.” He drank an entire glass to demonstrate how safe it was.

There was a painting on the wall of what looked to me like the manager, but he claimed it was his great grandfather, who'd built the motel.

The townspeople were on the whole nice and implored us to see the cove.

The cove was quite picturesque, separated almost entirely from the sea, like a naturally formed bowl. And the water inside was warm, apparently heated from below. It was no wonder so many townspeople liked spending time there, wandering the rim of the bowl.

When we arrived, the only other tourists in Oblith were already there, splashing about.

Mom and dad stripped down to their bathing suits and slipped into the water.

I stayed on the rim, on my phone, reading about Oblith. There was very little information.

I heard my mom comment that the water was comfortably warm.

Almost too warm, dad said.

And when I looked up I saw what seemed like steam rising from the surface. All around the rim, the townspeople had stopped walking, spread at equal intervals, and lifted their arms.

One of the tourists screamed then—

Ribbons of seaweed were crawling up her body—and mom's and dad's, binding, holding them in place.

The townspeople chanted.

My dad yelled at me to run and I set off away from the cove, scrambled up a nearby rocky slant and turned just in time to see—through thick mist—the silhouetted figures of my parents and the tourists disappear. The steam cleared, and the water was red.

The chanting subsided. The townspeople dispersed.

I looked for a police station, but there were none, and in all the houses I passed I imagined people at their faucets, sucking like fish.

Eventually I hitchhiked away.

The woman who gave me a ride asked me why I’d come out here. I mentioned a town, but she said there wasn't one, and we drove through empty landscapes.

“See?”

*There is a legend about a roaming place that travels up and down the coast to harvest,* but it would be many years, when I had my own family, before I first heard about it.

“What about my parents?” I asked.

“That the unproductive give up their vigour for ones who truly do: that's no crime. It's economics,” she said, and she told me of the factories she owned and the investments she had made.

Then she took a drink of pink, bottled water, and when she turned next to look at me, her face was not human but resembled most a [catfish's.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
