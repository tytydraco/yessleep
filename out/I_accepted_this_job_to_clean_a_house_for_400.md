 

The old house stood at the edge of town, its windows shattered and walls weathered by time. The locals always whispered about its dark history. Tales of vanished families and eerie apparitions. "Psh, who would pass up a job that pays like this because of some fairytales?" I brushed aside the rumors and accepted the challenge, eager to escape my mundane routine.

The morning sun struggled to pierce through the heavy clouds as I stepped through the creaking front door. Dust hung in the air like suspended memories. The air was thick with a musty odor, a blend of decay and neglect. Armed with a broom and a determination to finish the job quickly, I began sweeping away the cobwebs that stretched across the grand foyer.

As the day wore on, the house seemed to come alive with strange noises. Floorboards creaked upstairs, and faint whispers seemed to linger at the edges of my hearing. I brushed it off as mere tricks of an overactive imagination.

By late afternoon, I had managed to tackle most of the ground floor. The setting sun cast long shadows that danced on the peeling wallpaper. My focus was unwavering, determined to prove that there was nothing supernatural about the old place. But then, in the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of movement – a fleeting figure disappearing around a corner.

My heart raced as I followed, broom in hand. The corridor stretched ahead, lined with closed doors. I hesitated, each door seeming to hold its own secrets. The whispering grew louder, forming words that I couldn't quite decipher. Swallowing my unease, I chose a door and pushed it open.

The room was freezing, a chill that seeped into my bones. The windows were covered in grime, allowing only feeble moonlight to filter in. And there, standing before a cracked mirror, was a figure – hazy and indistinct, like a specter. My breath caught in my throat as I watched the figure's movements mimic mine.

"Who's there?" I managed to croak out, my voice barely louder than a whisper. The figure turned its head slightly, and for a brief moment, its face came into focus. Hollow eyes stared back at me, a silent scream frozen on its lips. Panic surged within me, and I stumbled backward, crashing into a table and knocking over a dusty photograph.

The frame shattered, revealing a faded picture of a family – parents and two children, all smiling against a backdrop of the very house I stood in. My heart pounded as recognition struck – the whispers, the figure, the family – they were all intertwined, bound by some tragic fate.

With a renewed sense of urgency, I fled the room and descended the stairs. But the once familiar hallway now stretched endlessly before me. Doors appeared where there were none before, and the walls seemed to close in as the whispers grew louder, forming a chorus of anguished voices.

Desperation clawed at me as I pushed through doors, searching for an exit that remained just out of reach. I stumbled into a room that was empty except for a single chair facing a window. The moonlight bathed the seat in an eerie glow, and I knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that I was meant to sit there.

Trembling, I lowered myself onto the chair, gazing out at the moonlit landscape. The whispers crescendo, a cacophony of voices that told stories of sorrow and longing. My mind felt as if it were unraveling, the lines between reality and the supernatural blurring beyond recognition.

And then, silence. The voices ceased, and a profound stillness settled over the room. The chair beneath me vanished, and I tumbled into darkness.

I awoke outside the house, the morning sun warming my face. The old building stood before me, weathered and abandoned. A sense of relief flooded through me, and I couldn't tell if what I had experienced was a nightmare or something more. As I walked away from the house, I couldn't help but glance back one last time, half-expecting to see a figure in the window.
