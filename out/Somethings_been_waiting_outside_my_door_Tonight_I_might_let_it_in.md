I first noticed it standing outside my door about a week ago. Each night it comes back, and I think it wants in. I don’t know much else about it, except that it stands on two feet. That’s all I can tell by the shadow it casts beneath the doorway.

 One night I woke out of a dead sleep with an awful feeling, like that jolt you get when you realize someone is coming up behind you. Lying in bed, I listened for something in my apartment. Then I heard it—hurried shambling right behind my door. Something was out in the hallway.

 I held my breath and heard it sniffing the air like a hound. I didn’t know what it was interested in—fresh food, the smell of fear—but it found something it liked. It hissed with a long, satisfied sigh. I stayed awake and listened for it all night, praying it wouldn’t come in. It never tested the lock, and by daybreak, the sniffing stopped.

 I never talked to my neighbors, but the next day, I stopped someone at the mailbox and asked if he heard anything. He looked at me funny and hurried away. I heard his door lock down the hall.

 It came back that night, louder, like it wanted to be heard. I sat up in bed, watching the door. I had locked it, but it didn’t try to come in. It only tapped against the door, in rhythm with my heartbeat. Aggravated, rapid.

 “Who’s there?” I said.

 The noise stopped. The shadows under the door moved away. I still couldn’t sleep.

 In the morning I went to work, locked myself in a custodial closet, and took a nap. Just once I woke up, in the dark and unsure of where I was, and thought I heard sniffing outside the door. I stayed late that day and didn’t want to go home.

 I swallowed a sleep-aid before bed. If the visitor came back, I figured I’d sleep right through it. I don’t know how long it had been standing at my door before it knocked. My body jerked like a hanged man, and I stood to my feet. My steps to the door where as subtle as snowfall. I didn’t want it to hear me coming. I held an eye to the peephole. The view was fogged with breath and unclear, then it all went dark for a moment. I was looking it right in the eye.

 I told it to leave, but it wouldn’t move. I banged on the door like I wasn’t terrified and said I’d come out there. It only sighed with a long, raspy hiss. I took another sleep-aid and buried my head under my pillow.

 There was no use trying to sleep. The pills failed whenever it arrived. I counted sheep in the dark while my doorknob spun like a drill.

 Last night, I gave up. I left the door unlocked. If it wants in, it won’t be stopped. I lay awake all night. Sometime before dawn, I heard the thrust of a key. It locked the door.

 Tonight, I’ve left the door wide open. The hallway light is bright, but I don’t care. No one has walked by in a while, but I don’t mind the lack of privacy at this point. I won’t be sleeping. My eyes are red and dry and trained on the hallway’s ugly wallpaper.

 I think I hear it in my closet.
