I don’t know how much time I have left.

That isn’t me trying to sound dramatic. I mean it literally. Something is wrong with my hands. They still move, but not exactly when I tell them to. Like there’s a delay. Like I’m typing and then watching it happen a second later.

If this cuts off in the middle, that’s why.

I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else it would even make sense. The police would think I’m paranoid. My family would panic and make things worse. And if I wait much longer I don’t think I’ll be able to explain it clearly at all.

So please treat this as a warning.

Do not try to confirm any of this.  
Do not look for the place.  
Do not repeat what I did just to see if it works.

It works. That’s the problem.

I’ll start at the beginning. I have to. Because if you recognize any of this happening to you, you still have time to stop.

Three weeks ago I found a post online that shouldn’t have still been there.

I’m not linking it. I’m not quoting it. I’m not even going to describe the username. That matters more than you think. I didn’t know that then.

The post was old. Buried. No comments. No upvotes. The title was boring in a way that felt accidental, like someone hadn’t meant to publish it at all. Something about maintenance notes or restricted access. I would have scrolled past if not for one sentence near the end that didn’t fit with the rest of it.

“If you hear yourself walking before you take a step, stop immediately.”

That line stayed with me all night. It didn’t read like fiction. It read like a safety warning written after something went wrong.

I work in infrastructure inspection. Old facilities. Closed sites. Places that still exist but aren’t supposed to be used anymore. I read a lot of dry reports. That sentence didn’t feel imaginative. It felt earned.

I went back the next day to reread the post.

It was gone.

Not locked. Not archived. Gone. The account was deleted. The page returned an error. I checked caches and mirrors and archives even though I don’t usually bother with that stuff. Nothing. It was like it had never existed at all, except my brain kept scrolling to where it should have been.

That should have been the end of it.

Two days later I got an email at my work address from an internal system that hasn’t been active in years. No sender name. No subject. Just an attachment.

I almost deleted it. What stopped me was the filename.

It matched a reference number from the post.

The document wasn’t meant for me. That was obvious immediately. It was a scanned report. Old paper. Handwritten notes in the margins. Different fonts like it had been assembled over years by different people who didn’t talk to each other.

It was a restricted maintenance log for a site that officially doesn’t exist anymore. Not abandoned. Not demolished. Removed. That’s the word it used.

At first it was boring. Routine inspections. Air quality checks. Structural notes. Then halfway through the tone changed.

Entries got shorter. The handwriting got worse. Time stamps stopped lining up. Inspections days apart describing the same event like it had just happened again.

And then there were the reminders.

They weren’t even labeled as instructions at first. Just notes written over and over like the person was afraid they’d forget.

Do not enter alone.  
Do not acknowledge reflections.  
Do not correct the echo.

That last one was written seven times.

I didn’t understand what it meant. I still don’t. Not really.

There was a map at the end.

That’s when I understood why it was sent to me.

The site was close. Close enough that I had driven past the access roads without realizing what they were.

I need to explain something about myself here. I’m not reckless. I don’t chase adrenaline. I’ve delayed inspections because a door sounded wrong when it closed. I’m the kind of person who double checks exit routes.

But this didn’t feel like curiosity.

It felt like procedure. Like I had already agreed to go and was just now remembering.

The route on the map followed utility roads I already knew. The last turn wasn’t marked. Just a break in the trees where the gravel changed color.

I told myself I’d only confirm the location. That I wouldn’t go inside. That I’d treat it like reconnaissance.

That’s the lie.

The structure didn’t look strange at first. Concrete. Low profile. Half buried. The kind of thing you’d mistake for a water facility if you didn’t know better.

No signs. No cameras. No locks.

The door was already open.

That should have been enough to make me leave.

Instead I checked my watch.

The time matched the log exactly. Down to the minute. The document had said the site was “accessible” at that time.

That’s when I felt fear for the first time. Not panic. Not shock. Just the quiet realization that something was already ahead of me.

Inside, the air was too dry. My footsteps sounded wrong. Not louder or softer than expected. Just out of sync. Like the sound belonged to someone else walking almost with me.

I remembered the sentence.

If you hear yourself walking before you take a step, stop immediately.

I froze.

The sound continued for a fraction of a second.

Then stopped.

I should have left.

Instead I pulled out my phone and started recording notes. Habit. Muscle memory. I told myself documentation was safer than uncertainty.

That’s when I noticed the corridor didn’t curve the way it should have.

That’s when I realized the building wasn’t laid out for people moving forward.

And that’s where this stops being about a strange place and becomes a warning.

Because once you notice that, it notices you back.

I’m having trouble staying focused now. The room feels farther away than it did when I started typing this. Like I’m looking at my screen through the wrong prescription.

I need to post this before I lose track completely.

If this gets attention, I’ll continue while I still can.

If it disappears like the original post did, then maybe that’s intentional.

But if you take one thing from this, let it be this.

Some places aren’t hidden.  
They’re waiting for the right person to remember them.

And if you ever find yourself somewhere familiar that feels like it’s expecting you, leave.

Don’t check one more room.  
Don’t finish the thought.  
Don’t try to be brave.

Just leave.

If I can still write, I’ll update this.
