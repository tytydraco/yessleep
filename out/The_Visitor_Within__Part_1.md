Hi Reddit,

I don’t know where to begin, but I need help—real help. I’m a single father now, with two kids, twins John and Jane (not their real names). I’ve been working over 40 hours a week to keep things afloat, to make sure they’re taken care of. But no matter how much I work, how much I give, something is wrong—terribly wrong.

Before she died, their mother had a dream for our family: the perfect life with the white picket fence, the family dog—the whole lot. But that dream was stolen from her, ripped away too soon. On her deathbed, she made me promise her, “Take care of our children and never put them in harm’s way.” I thought I could keep that promise. I thought I could protect them.

When she passed, the kids were just 5. They didn’t handle it well, which I knew was normal. My family came from across states to help, even stayed with us for nearly a year. But my son… he took it the worst. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t reach him. He just shut down, stopped speaking. The doctors called it traumatic mutism.

I did everything the experts told me to do—cognitive behavioral therapy, play therapy, family therapy, speech therapy… every kind of therapy under the sun. The only thing that ever gave me a glimpse into his mind was the diary we started when he was almost 7. His silent world, written down on paper.

At first, the diary seemed like a small relief, a way to understand him. But recently, his entries have taken a dark turn. I showed them to his therapist, and they brushed it off, saying he’s created an imaginary friend—a coping mechanism, they said, something to comfort him. But… I can’t shake the feeling that this is something far darker, something I don’t understand.

Every time I read his words, it’s like a cold hand wraps around my heart, squeezing the life out of me. His descriptions, the things he writes… they don’t feel right. It’s as if I’m staring into a void, a place where something unnatural stirs.

I’ve rewritten some of these entries to share here, in hopes that someone—anyone—can help me make sense of this. I haven’t changed his words, only made them legible. Am I losing my grip on reality? Or is there something far more sinister lurking behind my son’s words?

I’m sorry for the long backstory, but I needed to lay it all out. Any advice, any help, is welcome. Just… please, don’t make this any harder than it already is. Thank you. I’m praying someone here can help me.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary. Today was a good day. Nancy took us to the park, and we got ice cream. I love ice cream. The ice cream man is nice. He’s always there, every day. He always gives me my favorite popsicle when I do the shh sign. Today, he put his finger to his lips to shhh and I did too and like always he gave me my favorite popsicle. The park had Mr. Clown today. He was in the woods looking at everyone and he then looked at me. I’ve never seen him at the park, but I was happy to see him. He began to make faces and when I laughed he would smile real big. I tried to show Jane, but she didn’t seem to care. She said, “What am I looking at?” I guess she couldn’t see him. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

I had fun at Mr. Smith’s house today. He had lots of games and treats. He showed me pictures and asked me what I wanted most. I pointed to the mommy picture. He said “someday soon,” then looked at the clock. He rubbed my hair and squeezed my nose. That’s how he says goodbye. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary. Nancy took us to the park again today. I went on the red slide, my favorite one. No other kids go on it, so it’s mine. Today, I found a popsicle on the slide. I ate it but I think Jane saw me eat it. She screamed at Nancy, saying I got ice cream without her. Nancy looked confused because I already ate my popsicle, Nancy then bought us both ice cream. When we went to the ice cream truck, the ice cream man did the shh sign again and gave me my favorite popsicle. Double ice cream is fun. Dad came home early, and we watched Adventure Time. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary. I saw Mr. Clown last night. I was playing by the window, and I saw him in the woods. He had a big black bag. Maybe it had his clown shoes or maybe toys. He looked at me, and I looked at him for a long time. He honked his red nose, so I honked mine back. Then he walked away. Mr. Clown is funny. Bye, Diary.

Dear Diary,

Nancy took me to Mr. Smith’s today. We played more games. Mr. Smith showed me more pictures, and I picked the puppy this time. He said he has a puppy and that someday he’ll let me pet it. Nancy took us to Ryan’s house after. I don’t like Ryan. He only plays with Jane. I like the woods more, finding sword sticks. Nancy yelled at me for playing there. She never yells at Jane, only me. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary. Jane hit me today. We were at the park, and I saw Mr. Clown again. He honked his nose, and I honked mine back. I laughed, and so did he. I wanted Jane to laugh too, so I tried to show her Mr. Clown. But she didn’t want to see him. She told me to go away and then hit me. I cried, and Nancy hugged me, saying Jane just didn’t want to play. I wish Jane knew she was going to Jupiter, and I was going to Mars. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary. Dad came home early today, and we went to the park. I took him to the red slide, and we found a popsicle there. I was happy, but Dad said not to eat things that aren’t ours. But it’s mine because I’m the only one who goes to the red slide. Dad said he’d buy me ice cream instead, but when we went to the truck, it wasn’t there. Dad asked people if they saw the ice cream man, but they said he wasn’t there today. That’s weird, the ice cream man is always there. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary. Today, Dad took us to Ryan’s house. I don’t like it there, but I saw Mr. Clown in the woods. He was close to Jane, like he was going to give her a hug. But Mr. Clown is my friend. I ran up to him, and Jane yelled, “Ew, get away from me, loser!” I wasn’t running to her, I was running to Mr. Clown. He looked at me like he didn’t understand. Silly Mr. Clown. I gave him a sword stick, and we played. But then he stopped and dropped the stick. He just looked at me for a long time, not moving. I thought he was done playing, so I started to walk away, but then he pulled out a popsicle. I tried to grab it, but he moved back and wagged his finger. He started licking his popsicle, and I didn’t like it. But then he pointed to his pocket, and I saw another popsicle. I grabbed it, and he started licking his faster. He wanted to race. I tried to lick mine as fast as I could, but he was faster. When he finished, he honked his nose, so I honked mine. Mr. Clown is nice. I like Mr. Clown. Ok, bye Diary.
