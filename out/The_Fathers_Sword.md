"I accept," the elderly man replied, stepping forward. "What happens now?"

He had just enough time to look surprised before the angel ripped him in half.

Blood and gore sprayed across the alley. A few drops struck my exposed face as I watched in frozen horror.

In his dying moments—as his upper body was held in the angel's talons—a white sword appeared in the old man's hand. He swung at the angel, but his strength gave out before the blow could land—sending the sword flying in an arc from his dead fingers to clatter on the ground near me. I didn't dare move as I hid behind the dumpster.

The angel looked like a mythological hero brought to life, even now, splattered in gore. He was around seven feet tall and wearing white, blood-covered robes that accentuated his impressive physique. Folded, white wings sprouted from his back, and his compassionate, friendly expression had not left his face.

As he raised the dripping halves of the old man, cuts appeared over his exposed flesh. They slowly opened, revealing their true nature.

Eyes.

Dozens of eyes opened all over his visible skin. They fixed their gazes on the corpse.

I was beyond shock. I was beyond fear. I was disassociating. It felt like I was outside of my body, as I watched a new pair of eyes open on a bare part of the angel's neck.

They were the eyes of the old man. They were looking in my direction.

In an instant, all of the other eyes locked onto me. I snapped back into my body as the angel's head turned.

*No.* My heart seized in my chest. I couldn't breathe. I was petrified with terror. I should have run, but it was too late. *Oh god, please no. Please.*

He dropped the butchered body from his claws and faced me.

I attempted to say something, to beg perhaps, but nothing escaped my open mouth. My body, flooded with adrenaline, was betraying me. My frantic thoughts tripped over themselves as I tried to react.

The angel noticed the sword on the ground, and astonishment flickered over his face before his attention snapped back to me. He grinned, revealing pointed teeth.

Then he started running.

My fight or flight response suddenly chose "fight".

In an insane, desperate move, I dove to the ground and reached for the white sword.

My right hand wrapped around its gray hilt, and a wave of power washed up my arm and over my body. Strength. Clarity. It felt like I had been sleepwalking my entire life until that moment.

I looked up, and the angel was almost on me. He lunged and I threw myself to the side, barely avoiding his reaching talons.

Not expecting my dodge, he overextended and smashed into the concrete wall—cracking it. In one smooth movement, he pushed off and rounded on me before I could get to my feet.

On my knees, I had just enough time to put my other hand on the hilt. A small white flame flickered across the blade as I raised it toward him point-first.

His hands wrapped around my throat as his momentum slammed us to the ground. My vision flashed as his entire weight pressed down on me.

I screamed.

A moment passed. He was crushing me with his body, but he wasn't doing anything else. His clawed fingers had harmlessly slipped from my neck. In fact, he seemed completely limp. I wriggled until I was free enough from his body to see why.

The sword was sticking out from his back. He had impaled himself on it when he landed on me, and the pale fire dancing across the blade was now spreading across his corpse.

Panicking, I struggled to get the rest of my body free from his massive frame, but I couldn't. I watched in horror as the fire spread. It reached me and I screamed, about to burn alive.

Nothing happened.

The white flame was touching me, but it wasn't spreading. I didn't feel any heat at all.

I thought it was an illusion—or a hallucination—until the angel began to burn away. The fire consuming his body was being pulled into the sword.

Fascinated, I lay there and watched as the rest of the angel was consumed by fire, disappearing into the blade, until all that remained was the seemingly weightless sword I held pointed at the night sky.

I sat up and finally had the chance to examine the sword. I released my left hand from the hilt, and its pale fire faded away.

It was about four feet long—about the height from the ground to my armpit if I was standing up—with a razor-sharp, double-sided blade made of some kind of strange white metal. It had a straight crossguard and a hilt that was just the right length for me to wield with both hands.

Perhaps the most curious thing about it was the rounded pommel. It had five colorless gems wrapping around it, and one gem in the base that glowed with a faint, pure light.

The sword was perfectly balanced, even with one hand. It was like an extension of my arm, as if it were made for me.

I admired the sword for a moment until I remembered that I had almost died not even a minute ago.

I glanced over at the corpse of the old man, surrounded by blood and gore. Both pieces of his corpse. I rolled over onto my knees and threw up.

People living in the apartment over the wall were opening their doors to investigate the loud noises they had heard from the alley, and I panicked. Being found with a sword in my hands near a murdered, bisected man would not go well for me. I tried to let go of the sword.

I couldn't let go. It was stuck to my right hand.

*What?* I frantically tried to peel it off, but it wouldn't budge from my palm.

The voices nearby were getting louder. They would see me soon.

*GET OFF!* I willed with every part of my being to get the sword out of my hand.

It vanished.

There was no time to be shocked. I lurched to my feet and fled to the other side of the alley before I could be discovered.

I was shaking as I walked around the block. Too much had happened to me in the last ten minutes. I ran my hands over my face, trying to regain my composure, and saw traces of blood on my palms. I wiped my face with the inside of my shirt as I neared the growing crowd in front of the alley.

Some people screamed when they saw the body. Some pulled out phones to take pictures. Some decided that they were detectives and knew exactly what had happened. I was still calming down at the edge of the crowd when law enforcement arrived and started clearing everyone out.

Eventually, as flashing lights continued to wash over me, I gathered enough courage to approach the police cordon and flag down an officer. He took immediate interest when I told him I was a witness, and led us into the alley so that he could hear me over the crowd.

I explained that I had been walking home from a late shift at work when I heard voices from a nearby alley. Naturally curious, I had taken a quick look and caught a glimpse of the angel, so I went to hide behind a dumpster and—

"Wait," the officer said, holding up a hand. "An angel?"

"Yes," I said. "And as I got closer, I heard—"

"An angel," he said, frowning now. "The kind with wings? From Heaven?"

"Yes," I replied, irritated. I wanted to get this over with and go home. He wasn't going to believe me, but I would feel guilty for the old man if I didn't try.

I continued quickly, before he could interrupt me again. "He was talking with an old man," I said. "When I got close enough to listen, I heard the angel tell him that if he accepted, he would be delivered to Heaven—"

Instantly, night turned to day, and I was in paradise.

"—and... and..." I trailed off and collapsed to the grass as vertigo, exhaustion, confusion, and adrenaline all hit me at the same time. Stunned, I raised my eyes to take in my surroundings.

What I saw hit me with almost physical force, knocking the wind out of me.

It was the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. There was no way I could have been asleep, because not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined such a fantastic landscape. Tears started to roll down my face.

I was sitting in a glade resting on top of a large hill covered in flowers and lush, green grass. Flower petals and butterflies of all colors drifted lazily in the air, and I could see hundreds of vibrant birds flying higher up in the sky. A breeze created waves in the grass and gently brushed across my face. I breathed it in. It was the freshest air to ever enter my lungs.

An ancient forest surrounded me, filled with all kinds of life. It looked untouched by human hands, as if I had gone back in time to witness the true glory of wild and untamed nature. Towering trees that must have been thousands of years old created a vast canopy, filtering the sun to a dappled light that covered the mossy forest floor. I could see animals and insects of all kinds, and they were thriving.

All of this was just what I could see with my eyes. The smell of flowers, wood, and grass was equally intoxicating. Music of countless birds filled my ears, joyful and free. I heard wind whistling through branches and cries of animals in the forest. I could feel the grass under my fingers. Everything was perfect. I was in a place of legends and myth.

I was in Heaven.

I sat there for around thirty minutes, perhaps longer. It might have been hours, but it didn't matter. I was truly at peace. It was the best moment of my life.

All good things come to an end, however.

Someone was standing at the edge of the forest, watching me.

I shot to my feet, peace forgotten. I raised my sword and prepared to defend myself—

For a moment I forgot the danger and looked down incredulously at my sword, which had just appeared in my hand from thin air.

I raised the white blade to eye level in disbelief. *Did I just summon this sword?*

Whoever was standing motionless at the edge of the woods was all the way down the hill, so I could afford to be briefly distracted.

I focused and tried to dismiss the sword, and it disappeared almost immediately.

I focused again on bringing it back, and it returned.

*I'm in Heaven with a magic sword,* I thought, stupidly.

Too many unbelievable things had been happening, and I was starting to become numb to it all. I reluctantly accepted that I had some kind of magic sword—in Heaven—and moved on.

Feeling more secure with the sword in hand, I carefully descended the hill to get a better look at my stalker.

A tall woman with long, black hair wearing white robes was standing under a tree. She was gorgeous, almost suspiciously so. It was like she had stepped out of a painting; flawless and without a single hair out of place. She stared at me, her eyes strikingly blue, with a neutral expression as I kept my distance. I didn't see wings, but she was dressed the same way as the last angel.

*"Who are you?"* I called out, sword pointed at the ground.

*"Lydia,"* she called back. She didn't move.

She was talking to me, which meant she wasn't a mindless killer. I stepped a bit closer so we didn't have to shout.

"What do you want?" I asked cautiously.

Lydia was studying the sword in my hand. "I wanted to see if it was true," she said.

"See if what was true?" I asked. I followed her eyes and held up the blade. "This?"

She ignored me. "A Fragment of the Father returns to Heaven," she muttered to herself. She looked up and met my eyes. "Follow me," she commanded as she turned to leave.

I stood my ground. There was absolutely no way I was trusting her that quickly.

"No," I said. "The last angel tried to murder me. Show me your teeth."

Lydia stopped and turned back to face me, surprised. After a moment, she flashed a brilliant smile, revealing her immaculately clean, normal teeth. She didn't have wings, talons, or pointed teeth like the last angel, but she was unnaturally tall and wearing the same robes. I was still on edge.

"I'm not an angel," she said, waving a hand to the side dismissively, "and whoever tried to kill you could not have been one. You must have been deceived by a spawn of Hell."

It was almost absurd how anyone could be tense in such a beautiful place, but I was. I kept my sword out as flower petals gently fell through the air between us.

"Why would a spawn of—" I started to say.

"STOP!" Lydia shouted, her eyes widening in sudden panic.

I abruptly shut my mouth, confused and slightly alarmed, before she explained.

"You are undoubtedly new to your power," she said, letting out a breath. "You must have Spoken before you arrived here. Be very careful with your words."

"Spoken?" I asked, completely lost.

"You Spoke the word 'Heaven'," she said. "The Fragment you carry in your soul holds His lingering power, and when He Spoke, reality obeyed."

Lydia continued. "If you had carelessly Spoken 'Hell', you would have most likely died. His lingering power is diminished there, which means you are as well." She looked at me seriously. "You need to choose your words wisely until you master the intentions behind them."

I had a lot of questions, but one was more important than the others.

"What do I... Speak... to go back home?" I asked.

"'Earth'," she answered, before quickly adding, "but please don't Speak it yet. There's so much more you can learn if you follow me. I'll take you to a place where you can see everything for yourself. Where you can understand what it means to carry one of the Fragments."

I stood there for a moment considering her words. I was tempted to leave Heaven immediately regardless of her promises. Something about her seemed... off.

Lydia saw my hesitation. "You don't have to trust me yet," she said, reasonably. "Follow at a safe distance, and at any time you may simply Speak the word 'Earth' if you wish to leave."

She convinced me, for the moment at least. I would see what she wanted me to see and leave if it seemed dangerous.

"Alright," I conceded. "I'll follow you for a while. Forgive me for being cautious."

"I understand," she said, turning and walking away. I followed her this time.

Lydia moved confidently through the forest as I trailed behind her. I struggled to match her pace, as she seemed to know the way by heart. There was no path; she simply walked between trees, around branches, and over mossy logs. I appreciated the wild, untouched forest, but walking through it was a different story.

I dismissed my sword after I almost tripped and fell on it. I could always summon it again if I needed to. Eventually, I got the hang of navigating the forest floor and started to appreciate my surroundings.

It was like I was walking through a fairytale. Rabbits, deer, raccoons, butterflies, birds, flowers, ancient moss, and more filled my eyes as I went on. Nowhere on Earth had this much life. Not even close. Even the forests in movies weren't this perfect.

However, after meeting Lydia, I started to notice that things were a little *too* perfect. There were no insects bothering me. It was room temperature. The animals had absolutely no fear of me. I was beginning to suspect that it wasn't natural at all, and the child-like wonder was being replaced by unease.

My awe for Heaven was slipping away.

During the last half of our journey, it felt like I was being watched. I kept checking over my shoulder, but no one was there.

After about an hour of travelling through those unsettling woods, we emerged into a large clearing. I immediately saw a magnificent structure that seemed to rise directly from the undisturbed grass around it.

It was the largest chapel I had ever seen. It must have been at least fifty stories high. Massive stained glass windows, tinted red, covered all sides. The building itself was dome-shaped, made of some kind of white stone, with five entrances and steepled towers on each corner. Other than the windows, all of it was a striking ivory that gleamed in the sun—

I stopped as I realized something.

There was no sun. Above me was nothing but a blue sky filled with clouds.

*Where is the sun?* I wondered, unnerved. *Where is the light coming from?* I put that question aside for the moment and picked up my pace to catch up with Lydia, who was waiting in front of the large entrance doors.

As I approached, she effortlessly threw open the thirty-foot-tall door of the main entrance and left it open for me as she walked inside.

I slowly stepped into the open doorway, ready to summon the sword at any moment, and peeked inside. I wasn't ready for what I saw.

The entire chapel was a hollow dome. There were no supporting pillars; it was just one cavernous room almost fifty stories high. The floor was seamless marble, and the pews covering most of it were crafted from rich, vibrant brown wood.

What caught my eye the most required me to step inside, and so I did.

When I passed the threshold of the door, an odd feeling washed over me. A subtle pressure on my body. It was hard to describe, but it felt like the inside of the chapel was more "real" somehow. 

As I walked down the main aisle, I felt like an ant. The pews were arranged in a circular formation, all facing toward the center of the room, which was an empty space about one hundred feet in diameter. Lydia was standing across from me as I entered the circle.

Finally, I was able to fully appreciate the most astonishing feature of the chapel. I slowly turned in place to take it all in.

The interior walls and windows of the dome were entirely covered in an all-encompassing, breathtaking work of art depicting a battle between Heaven and Hell.

The red-tinted, stained glass windows were scenes of angels invading Hell, and the sections of smooth white rock between them were scenes of demons attacking Heaven.

One scene dominated the rest. It was across from the entrance and had been the first thing I saw when I peeked into the chapel.

It was an epic battle between gods. One god on the white rock with an army of angels, and one god on the red window with a legion of demons. In the split between them, both gods had one arm reaching across. They were ripping each other's hearts out at the same time.

Looming over everything and spread out across the ceiling was a colossal rendition of a sun. There may have been a second, slightly smaller sun nested inside the larger, but it was hard to tell. It all felt a bit out of place in a chapel full of battle scenes.

*Wait...* I thought, scanning the walls and coming to a realization.

All of the battle scenes had suns in them. Several suns. As I looked closer, I discovered more and more suns hidden in the art.

"Why are there so many suns?" I wondered aloud. "And why isn't there a sun outside?"

I looked down from the wall to ask Lydia. *She wasn't there.*

Panicking, I spun around.

She had circled back and was standing between me and the exits.

My heart missed a beat. Her friendly demeanor was gone. Her eyes had turned cold and calculating, and her body was coiled, ready to spring. A predator watching its prey.

We stood there for a moment in ominous silence before I couldn't take it anymore.

"Is this what I think it is?" I asked bluntly.

Lydia smiled sympathetically, as if she was embarrassed on my behalf for being so naive.

"Earth," I said immediately.

A tingle passed through me. I was still in the chapel.

"Earth," I said louder, breaking out into a sweat. No effect.

"Earth!" I yelled desperately, putting all of my intention into the word. Nothing.

It wasn't working. There was no choice but to gamble. I closed my eyes.

"Hell!" I shouted, my whole body tensing.

An ominous chill went down my spine, but I remained where I was.

Dread was turning to despair. I wasn't getting out of this. Following her was a mistake.

Lydia was watching me, amused, as I tried to escape the trap she had led me into.

Then, wings unfolded behind her back.

Eyes opened across her skin.

Her nails extended and curved into vicious talons.

Angels began to enter the chapel from the doors far behind her.

I summoned my sword and when I grabbed it with both hands, pale fire *exploded* across the ivory blade. It was *far* more powerful than it had been on Earth. I recovered from shock and prepared to defend myself.

"So," I said, trying to keep the despair out of my voice as we faced off, "it was all a lie then. I guess this is what you meant by 'seeing everything for myself'."

Lydia laughed, stepping closer. "No, I didn't lie about that." She grinned, revealing her sharp, serrated teeth, and pointed up. "Everything is right there."

I couldn't help it. I looked up.

Across the entire ceiling where the colossal sun had been was a hideous *thing* that vaguely resembled an eye, and when I met its gaze—

I saw Everything.

And Everything saw *me*.

Unimaginably vast and unfathomably deep oceans of knowledge instantly slammed down into the small cup of my mind, overflowing and almost tangibly manifesting as exquisitely complex crystalline fractals of indecipherable information through every pore of my body in an infinitely short yet unbearably long duration of time across the entirety of my meaningless, pointless existence.

Everything.

A particle in an atom. An atom in a molecule in a neuron. A neuron in my brain in my skull in my body in a civilization on a planet in a solar system IN A GALAXY IN A GALACTIC GROUP IN A SUPERCLUSTER IN A UNIVERSE AND *THERE WAS MORE AND IT WAS IN MY HEAD AND* **IT WAS IN MY THOUGHTS AND I COULD FEEL IT AND I COULD HEAR IT AND** ***I COULD SEE IT AND IF I CONCENTRATED I WOULD UNDERSTAND—***

*"AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!"* I desperately ripped my eyes away from that white hole of insanity while I reflexively swung my sword to brutally cleave through Lydia—who had been lunging for me—killing her instantly and engulfing her falling body in white flame as blood showered the pews.

There was no time to recover as two flying angels swooped down from the sides, reaching for me—I frantically leapt back and my blade sheared off the legs of the first angel while the second clipped my shoulder with taloned fingers, shredding my arm and throwing me spinning to the ground.

My body moved on its own. I rolled and bounced backwards to my feet—slicing upward just in time to cut the angel open from groin to shoulder and setting him on fire. He fell to the floor, screaming.

I cried out in pain and disbelief as blood gushed from my arm. More angels were flying toward me from across the room, but I had bought myself a brief moment to process the sudden switch from relative peace to overwhelming violence. I couldn't believe I had just effortlessly killed three people—if these angels could be considered people—but I had a feeling I would have to do it again in the next ten seconds.

The burning bodies of the angels were being siphoned into my blade as I prepared to fight for my life. My bleeding started to slow, and strength poured into my muscles, more than adrenaline alone could account for. I tightened my grip on the hilt as five angels landed around me and hit the ground running.

I charged forward to avoid being surrounded and ran the first angel through before she was close enough to attack. I heaved her skewered body in a half circle and unsummoned the blade, sending the burning corpse flying towards the three angels behind me—making them dodge the flames and giving me enough time to deal with a slender angel who was now too close to swing at. I summoned my sword in his path, and he impaled himself on it before he could stop—his body kept its momentum and knocked me over, landing on top of me.

I panicked, trapped under a flaming corpse, and when a third angel raised his foot to kick my face in, I twisted the body toward him. He sliced half of his leg off on the protruding blade and collapsed on top of the corpse already pinning me down, howling in agony. He blindly reached over and managed to drag his talons across my face, almost blinding me, before succumbing to fire and pain.

Screaming in desperation, I dismissed the sword, and with a burst of strength I *pushed* so hard that both bodies went flying—crashing into a fourth angel who ignited as ghostly flame from the corpses spread to her. Blood was getting in my eyes when I started to stand up.

The last angel leapt at me as I was recovering and my blade, materializing mid-swing, sheared through her extended arms and continued forward to behead her. I barely managed to sidestep the falling corpse.

Immediate threats gone, I quickly wiped the blood out of my eyes and scanned my surroundings—making sure not to look at the ceiling.

Blood painted the marble floor and several rows of pews in the center of the room where I had been fighting. Twelve smouldering bodies littered the floor—Lydia's had already burned away—and as they disintegrated, small tendrils of flame trailed through the air toward me to be siphoned into the blade of my sword.

It wasn't obvious at first, but with the flames of thirteen bodies feeding the sword, I could feel a building warmth in my chest as it imbued me with power. Time seemed to slow down as my reaction time sharpened to a hair trigger. My body felt like it weighed nothing at all. I wasn't tired and I felt no pain—I ran my hand over my face and it was *healed*.

Most strikingly, even more than the healing, was how well I could fight now. I had never used a sword before, much less fought to the death. It was like my sword was guiding my every move. There was no doubt in my mind that I would have died many times over without the instincts it was giving me.

A few angels hovered off the ground, watching me. I couldn't understand why they weren't attacking until I realized— they had just watched me butcher their friends. They were afraid.

Good.

I started running down the main aisle for the entrance doors. The "eye" on the ceiling was almost certainly keeping me there. Now that it wasn't disguised, I could clearly feel a bizarre pressure from all directions. Like someone holding their hands on my shoulders, but over my entire body. Getting out of the chapel was my only hope to escape Heaven.

Apparently I had taken too long fighting the other angels, because I wasn't even a quarter of the way to the exit when, without warning, angels started flooding through the doors and spilling into the room. They spotted me immediately and closed in.

The power coursing through me from the sword was intoxicating, and I was too lost in it to feel fear. Gritting my teeth, I ran faster.

The growing army of angels was starting to coordinate, and I was forced to slow down when forty angels formed a wall between me and the doors. Twenty of them charged me, and the rest made sure I couldn't slip past.

Seconds before collision, it became clear that all of them had naked greed in their eyes as they watched my flaming sword, as if I was just an afterthought.

*They want the sword,* I had time to think as I raised it high, *and they're willing to die for it.*

Freedom was so close. I could see individual blades of grass outside the door.

A frenzied scream of defiance tore from my throat and I met twenty angels with a merciless sweep of my sword, cutting three of them down before I plunged into a chaotic struggle of blood and death.

Blood, gore, and fire clouded my vision as I brought the sword around in wild, ruthless arcs—cutting angels down like a scythe through wheat with every swing. Claws and teeth tore at my flesh, opening arteries and dealing mortal wounds—until they rapidly healed from the deluge of pale fire constantly flowing into the sword.

By the time it was over, I was completely drenched in wet, sticky blood. My appearance matched the floor.

Forty dead angels—or pieces of them—surrounded me, littering the floor. They burned in a bonfire of ghostly flame. I blinked the blood out of my eyes and spun in place, ready for the next enemy.

There were hundreds of angels circling me now. They weren't attacking.

I turned and prepared to charge for the exit when I stopped cold.

Fear broke through the euphoria of power as something appeared outside the door.

A knightly figure in brilliant gold armor stood in the grass. Every inch of their body was encased in gleaming metal, and their helmet had a long, horizontal slit that was dark, giving no clue as to who—or what—was inside. They were carrying a two-handed, double-headed battle axe that was almost as tall as they were.

While I stood there, paralyzed, they entered the chapel, ducking under the doorframe.

They ducked.

They ducked to pass through the door.

The door that was thirty feet tall.

I stared in horror at the armored giant towering over me. The axe they currently held in one hand was almost as large as a city bus, and its mirrored crescent blades, each easily as tall as I was, vaguely resembled an eye that—I quickly tore my eyes away from the axe.

Suddenly the giant *SLAMMED* the bottom of their axe to the floor so hard it split solid marble and shook the ground under my feet.

***"KNEEL."***

His voice thundered through all fifty stories of the chapel dome and struck me with almost physical force.

Silence fell like a blanket over the room as the giant waited for me to comply. Angels hovered around us at a distance.

For a brief moment, I actually considered kneeling. I knew that fighting this monster wasn't going to be the same as fighting angels. Healing wouldn't matter if I was hit by that axe, because there would be nothing left to heal.

Still, Lydia's betrayal was fresh in my mind. I knew I was going to die if I knelt.

"No," I said. "Let me—"

***"THEN DIE."***

Faster than I could blink, he raised his axe in both hands and *SWUNG* it down in a titanic arc.

I almost tripped backwards as I hastily dodged, and the crescent edge of the axe *CRASHED* into the floor, lodging five feet deep and sending chunks of marble spraying as projectiles—shredding angels in their path.

This giant was incredibly fast. Angels seemed to move through water now with my increased reflexes, but the giant was a bolt of lightning in comparison.

Burning bodies were on the floor between us, and when the giant dislodged his axe he jumped to the side out of the aisle, smashing through pews as he circled around toward me.

*He's avoiding the fire,* I realized. *If I can spread it to him, he might die.*

An insane plan took form in my mind.

There was no way I could get around the giant to reach the door; he would cut me down. I would have to deal with him to escape.

My thoughts were racing thanks to the sword, and only a second had passed. As the giant hopped around the final corpse, I dashed in before he landed, getting close enough so that he couldn't swing.

I drove the point of my sword towards his armored stomach, confident in its razor edge. Everything I had struck up to that moment had parted like butter.

The blade bounced off, not even scratching the golden breastplate.

I was so surprised that I didn't see the giant remove his left hand from the axe.

His fist connected with the right side of my chest, breaking all of my ribs and sending me flying. I crashed through five rows of pews before landing on my back.

I couldn't breathe as agony wracked my body. My right lung and other organs were pulverized, but the power filling me let me stumble to my feet as my ribs began to shift back into place.

Disoriented and in pain, I had just stood up when the giant sprinted over and brought the axe around in a massive horizontal sweep—about to cut me in half. I dove backwards to the ground.

*WOOSH*

It parted the air above my head with incredible force and the gale following its passage blasted a layer of blood off of my body.

I looked up as the giant effortlessly transitioned into an overhead strike to finish me off, and I saw ***THE EYE ON THE CEILING ABOVE HIM AND EVERYTHING WOULD MAKE SENSE IF I JUST—***

"NO!" I closed my eyes and pushed off from the ground with my left hand, unsummoned my sword to push with my right, and sent myself rolling sideways across the floor just in time for the axe to *SMASH* into the marble right next to me. The shockwave launched me into the air. I sailed in an arc toward the giant and hit the ground sprinting.

He didn't have enough time to free his axe before I passed under his legs and—in one smooth motion—twisted my heel in a flawless pirouette, extended my right hand, and summoned the sword just in time to *nick* the unarmored back of his knee.

The giant ***ROARED*** in pain as fire flickered to life on his leg. Not wasting this chance, I turned and dashed for the exit. Our fight had taken us farther into the room and now I had more distance to cover.

Seeing their champion wounded, the encircling angels moved as one. They flowed into my path, massing into a living wall between me and the door.

With dozens of incinerated angels feeding my sword, they were no match for me. My empowered reflexes let me control every individual muscle in my body with surgical precision, and my strength was great enough to rip angels apart with my bare hands. 

Sword blazing, I became an instrument of death. I spun around swiping claws, jumped to cut wings, sliced arteries, and dodged talons. I stabbed chests, sheared limbs, chopped heads, and carved a bloody path through their ranks. Angels, lost in hysterical fervor, crawled over their ignited and dying brethren to tear me apart, spreading the fire until we fought in a raging inferno of their own making. It almost seemed like they were competing amongst each other to meet my blade.

The giant let out another ***ROAR***, and I turned my head to see why as I closed in on the exit.

He had fallen to the floor after chopping his own flaming leg off and, knowing he wouldn't reach me in time to prevent my escape, had raised his axe in both hands.

I was seconds away from freedom.

***—BOOM—***

He threw his axe so hard it released a sonic boom.

It shot through the air like a cataclysmic missile, utterly annihilating angels in its way and turning them to crimson mist as it homed in on me.

With a scream of panic I jumped, exploding forward in a desperate attempt to clear the final distance.

Twisting in the air, I soared backwards and watched my death approach at unimaginable speed, growing in size and filling my vision.

At the last split-second, I felt the oppressive aura of the chapel leave my body.

I cried out as fast as my lungs could expel air.

*"EARTH—"*

Dirt sprayed across the alley as my back slammed to the ground, making a small crater and knocking the wind out of me. The sun was shining in the sky, back where it belonged.

Dismissing my sword, I lay there, spread out on the ground, and wept with relief. My body was shaking and I was breathing hard as I tried to calm my frayed nerves.

I heard a noise and turned my head.

Two men in dark jackets were standing next to me. Behind them were the two plastic chairs they had been sitting on before my sudden appearance, and between the chairs was a small table topped by an ashtray and a police radio.

I stared up at them and they stared down at me.

Silence.

Both of them reached for their guns.

Twisting my body, I kicked their legs out from under them, pushed off the ground, and lunged at the closest man while he was still falling. He hit the dirt just as I landed on him and my fist slammed into his nose, knocking him out. I had to pull my punch so I didn't kill him.

The other man had managed to pull his gun and his arm, almost in slow motion, swiveled to me. His finger was on the trigger as the muzzle lined up with my face.

Before he could shoot, I whipped forward with inhuman speed and slapped the gun out of his hand so hard I heard the bones in his fingers *snap*. He gasped in pain before I followed up with a left cross—breaking his jaw and sending him unconscious.

Silence returned. I remained kneeling on the ground and waited for my brain to catch up with reality. After a brief moment, I rose to my feet.

Standing over their senseless bodies, with my fists clenched and trembling, I looked down at them with incredulous disbelief.

*Why?* I thought, mentally exhausted. *Why can't I catch a break?*

I couldn't believe it. I was back on Earth for less than thirty seconds and I was already fighting for my life.

*Who even are these people?* I wondered before I bent down to search them.

The mystery was solved when I opened their wallets.

*Agents,* I thought grimly.

I had completely forgotten that I had vanished into thin air right in front of a police officer. I was facing the consequences now.

Suddenly, I froze in horror as something occurred to me.

*How did they know to wait in the alley?* I looked up at the sky. It was almost noon, and it had been night when I entered Heaven. *They must have been waiting here for hours.*

I followed that train of thought and reached a terrifying conclusion.

*The government must know,* I realized. *They somehow know what I have, and how it works.*

I looked down at their guns again. It was hard to tell in the moment, but now I saw them for what they really were.

Tranquilizer guns.

I had to get out of there immediately. I found a water bottle on the ground and rinsed the blood off of my face. Then, I took a jacket from one of the officers and put it on, hiding the top half of my blood-covered body. My pants and shoes were still visible, but there was so much drying blood on them that it almost looked like they were splashed by a bucket of brownish-red paint. I would have to risk it.

My house was probably being watched, so I decided to ask a stranger if I could borrow their phone—mine was destroyed—and call someone to pick me up, possibly my brother or a friend.

The first person I asked hesitated and looked me over suspiciously. I quickly walked away, afraid that they might call the police, and didn't approach anyone else after that.

I tried to think of some other way to get help as I wandered down the street, but it was hard to focus properly. Several times I had to stop to make sure the sun was still in the sky. Having no time to recover from an unending nightmare was starting to wear me down. I felt on edge, like I would have to fight again at any moment.

Eventually I recalled seeing public computers in my local library. If I had access to a computer, I would be able to send a few emails that would hopefully be read before the day was over. It wasn't the best plan but it was better than nothing, so I changed directions and went to the library.

I managed to keep a low profile as I made my way to a public computer in a relatively secluded spot of the library. That's where I am now.

I wrote all of this because I don't know what's going to happen to me after I leave. The only thing I'm sure of is that things will never go back to normal.

When I logged in to my account earlier, my life was shattered into a million pieces by the email I found waiting for me. It was sent minutes after I had returned from Heaven, from an untraceable email address full of random letters and numbers.

The subject line was "OPEN IMMEDIATELY".

I opened it.

This is what I read:
