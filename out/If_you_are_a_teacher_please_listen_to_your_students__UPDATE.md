Hello there. Sorry for the late update, but I've been through a lot of things. The last two days have been very crazy for me. Let me tell you my story. 

My plan worked, and three police officers broke my door down. It took them 30 minutes to get here. When the police officers arrived, the creature disappeared from my camera feed. The officers searched my house, and when they got to the cleaning room, I got out of the washing machine. They were shocked, but they eventually calmed down and took me to the police station for interrogation. 

I explained what happened to me, with slight modifications. I described the creature as an intruder, so my story won't be completely thrown out as a prank call. I mentioned the book that fell off the bookshelf as evidence of a break-in. The officers were convinced and sent me back to my home. 

It was nighttime when I returned to my home. I went to bed but not without triple-checking my door locks first. I went to sleep, still feeling a little scared. I dreamed, and I saw the creature. It was staring at me, like it wanted something from me. It then said in a raspy voice, "You shall bring to me one of your students by tomorrow night to be sacrificed. Bring the student to the place where it all started." A vision of my classroom was projected onto me, and I woke up, drenched in sweat. 

"There's no way I could sacrifice an innocent kid!", I thought to myself. I went back to sleep, but I can't fell asleep because I'm still debating whether to risk my life or sacrifice one of my students. The feeling of being watched was gone, at least. After what I thought was a two hour thinking session, I fall asleep.

When I taught the students tomorrow, I made sure to have fun with them because it could be my last day with them. We played games and covered no math that day, they were ahead anyway. The students and I enjoyed it, and when the bell rang, I walked out with a smile on my face, ready to face any horrors to save my students. 

Night came, and I was in my classroom. The creature opened the door and stared at me. It said, "Where is the sacrifice I demanded?" I answered, "I will sacrifice nobody for a fucking creature! These kids are more important to me than my life, and I'm not going to give one of them to an asshole like you!" Expecting to die a painful and gruesome death, I closed my eyes. Instead, the creature said, "Interesting. I admire your bravery. I want to play a game. Hide-and-seek, just like in your house. If I find you, you'll die. Deal?" I took the deal. 

The creature disappeared, and a 20-second timer started on my phone. I searched for a hiding spot and found an old, massive fridge. Being 5 feet tall, I hid in the fridge, and surprisingly, I fit in the fridge.  It was old, so it has a small hole because it's been damaged by some kid. It was not plugged in, so it is not too cold here. 20 seconds passed, and a one-hour timer started. The game just started. 

Having no cameras, the game was scarier than hiding in my house. I remembered that I shouldn't panic and show fear, so I controlled my breathing and calmed myself. I heard the library door being opened and remembered that it was far from me. This calmed me down, and I checked the timer. 53:45 remaining. 

I scrolled through cat videos to pass the time and calm myself down. Obviously, I had lowered my phone volume to nothing. When I got to my 8th cat video, I heard footsteps leaving the library and the bathroom door being opened. There are a lot of stalls there; I hoped it would delay the creature. I checked the timer again, and it showed 39:58 remaining. 

I noticed a ball in front of the fridge. I could throw the ball away to distract the creature, but I could get caught. The creature was still searching the stalls, so I opened the fridge swiftly, took the ball, and returned back to hiding. "I'll save it for later", I thought. The creature finally finished searching the bathroom. 31:21 remaining. 

The creature opened the science classroom. I heard the motion detector alarms coming from the science room. The science teacher has always been paranoid and always activates the motion detector in her classroom before going home. I guess the alarm stunned the creature because the footsteps stopped for a minute or so. The creature entered the science room and checked every cabinet there. It's getting closer. 23:34 remaining. 

I decided to throw the ball. I got out of the fridge and threw the ball as far as I could. I went back to hiding as the creature investigated the noise from the ball. The ball landed in front of the gym, quite far from my hiding spot. I heard the creature running from the science room to the gym. The footsteps got louder and louder as the footsteps passed through my hiding spot, then got softer and softer. It opened the gym door and began searching. 14:41 remaining. 

I opened my phone to look at some memes. They were funny, but I couldn't laugh. The creature was done searching the gym and was going to my classroom. There are a only a few hiding spot there, so I don't think it will take long to search my room. I was starting to breathe less because it was coming closer to me. 05:01 remaining. 

I stared at the countdown as the timer ticked down. Every second felt like a year closer to my doom. It has finished searching my classroom and is heading to the lockers. It destroyed the lockers, one by one. It got closer and closer to me. I looked at the countdown: 01:23 remaining. I can hear the creature walking in front of my hiding spot. I held my breath as the creature passed my hiding spot for the second time. It was searching the music room when my phone beeped. 00:00 remaining. I managed to stay hidden for an hour, but the creature is rushing towards me. It opened the fridge door, and I fell unconscious. 

I woke up in my bed. I tried moving my body, but I couldn't. The creature appeared in front of me with blue, comforting eyes. It said, "What an unusual hiding spot. You survived. I shall let you go free for your tenacity." Before the creature disappeared, the creature winked at me. I gained control of my body and went on to type this story. I am puzzled right now.  Why did the creature spare me? What did the creature want from me? Perhaps some questions will never be answered.
