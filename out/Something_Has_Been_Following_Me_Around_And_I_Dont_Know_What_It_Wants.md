Oh, Geez! Maybe someone on here could help me. I'm sure someone out there knows something about this. My name is. No no, that's not a good idea. Maybe that's how they found me. That's why I switched to a throwaway account on here in the first place. My name is not important. I'll get right to it. Someone...something has been following me for the last few days now. I first noticed them in my biology class. It was an odd time for a new student to be enrolling in Professor Crate's class but, ok. Stranger things have happened.  
  
There was nothing spectacular about her at first glance. She had on a university sweatshirt, some track pants, and a sports watch that looked like it had probably seen better days. If this was any other day and any other class, I probably would have never given them a second glance, but Professor Crate's class was one of my smaller courses. Everyone knew everyone, and most importantly the professor knew everyone. He made damn sure he was going to call on you at least a handful of times to make sure you were paying attention. Anytime I'm in his class it is so nerve-wracking! This new chick never got called on once, the luck on her! I started praying she would, I wanted to hear her name I was curious.  
  
We had a pop quiz that day in class. I hated being surprised. I would much rather know when something's coming, especially a test. A.D.D. and apprehension do not blend well with surprises. I couldn't look down at the paper anymore, nothing was making sense. I knew I had to concentrate but I had this magnetic pull redirecting my attention to my left, down the row of seats. There she was, just looking straight at me. No pencil in hand, nothing. I don't think she was even doing the test.  
  
This was the first time we locked eyes. There was something so majestically beautiful about her yet so offensive at the same time. She had this silky smooth pale white skin and this short black hair pulled back in a bun. Come to think of it her whole body had a paleness about it. Judging by her pale skin you could say sunlight never even touched her yet her dark hair had a brownish tint to it. The kind that someone would get after spending a while in the sun. The more disturbing features on her were her eyes and her mouth. They looked cruel and sad, almost sick, like a person who had the flu and was dehydrated for a week.  
  
I am by no means a perfect person, I never claimed to be. Please forgive me for saying this when I tell you that her appearance startled me. I try not to pass judgment on people. Maybe she was sick, maybe she didn't believe in wearing makeup, maybe she had a bad day, but whatever it was just terrified me. Judge me all you want, but you weren't there, you did not lock eyes with her.  
  
I recoiled in shock. A couple of students next to next to me rolled their eyes at me as if to say "Geez, take a pill you nut." a Xanax or an Ativan would have been like heaven, but not now. This was no time for mellowing out, I had a test I had to take.  
  
'When the chromosomes line up in mitosis, this is known as which phase'?  
  
"Come on, come on. Shoot. I know this!” The answer wasn't coming to me. Just then a shrewd ringing flooded my ears. I never heard anything like this before. It was miserable. My temples throbbed in pain. Suddenly, a voice filled my head, a low guttural whisper.  
  
"Did you tell them yet?" the girl's brutish mouth was moving but it was like she had a Bluetooth connection straight to my brain, the words weren't directly coming out of her mouth. "Tell your parents the truth. You're on academic probation, you'll never make it here."  
  
"No!" I instinctively shot up from my seat. My pencil and paper went flying across the room. The stagnant classroom of about twenty-five other students turned to face me in unison.  
  
"Excuse me Adams!" (my surname), Professor Crate called out. "What's the problem here?"  
  
I wanted to say something but had no clue what a remotely acceptable answer might even be. I opened my mouth but no words came out, so I bolted for the door as fast as I could. Well, my grade on that test was shot.  
  
In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and tried to calm myself down. I know what I saw, but there had to be some sort of rational explanation for why I saw it. I had been studying very hard. Maybe I wasn't sleeping enough and my brain was playing a trick on me. That had to be it.  
  
I splashed some ice-cold water from the sink onto my face and let every muscle in my body settle while I tried to process what had just happened to me. I was a tired, anxiety-stricken college student. I wasn't the first and wouldn't be the last.  
  
Things would be quiet for a day or so and I managed to put the whole incident out of my mind. It was an early Saturday morning so that meant it was time to put my rear in gear and get to the gym. I took one Primaforce caffeine capsule and I was ready to ready to go. It was strength day and I was prepared to work up a sweat. What I was not prepared for was the reason why I would be sweating so hard in the first place. I was working on my triceps when I saw her again, over at the free weights.  
  
Seeing her in workout clothes like this, she looked even more frail and sickly than in class, and there she was lifting the free weights like no one I had ever seen before. One rep after another, no struggling to breathe, nothing. I swear she turned to me and started doing the repetitions one-handed just to show off. Then her mouth started moving again. My ears started ringing again as her voice intruded my thoughts.  
  
"Why do you even waste your time coming here? You're not even trying. Who let you in in here?"  
  
However she was doing it, I was determined not to let her get into my head. She had the nerve to call me a wimp, I'd show her. I pushed myself harder than I ever had before. My face looked like it could combust at any second, sweat poured down my forehead like a thunderstorm. I wanted to give up. I wanted to quit, but I wouldn't. I refused to show weakness in front of this woman, this thing, but still, the harsh words persisted.  
  
"You'll never be good enough."  
  
"Screw you!” the weights on my machine came crashing down. Two other guys were standing in front of me. I have no clue where they came from. One of them ripped my headphones out of my ears.  
  
"What's going on?" They asked me. "Are you gonna give up the machine or not?"  
  
"You can have it just as soon as I'm done!" I protested. "That girl over there tried to call me a wimp. I ain't gonna let that slide."  
  
"Who you talking about?"  
  
I pointed toward the free weights but when they stepped out of the way and unimpeded my view she was gone and the weights hung neatly back on the rack. She couldn't have gotten away that fast. My mind was not playing tricks on me. I was sure of it. In class, I was the only one who could hear her and now I learned that I was the only one who could see her.  
  
I wish I could say that was the end of things. However, we wouldn't be here right now if that was true. The taunts were one thing. I could handle those. As long as she kept her distance I guess I could deal with some telepathic bullying. Lord knows I was bullied enough as a kid, I was used to it. When things turned physical though, we had a problem. The next time we crossed paths I was at McDonald's on the way to school. I was in line waiting for my meal, which by my calculations was at least seven or eight hundred. I know they say it's not good for you to keep track of every meal like that but I wasn't going to let myself go overboard. No matter what that thing said about me I knew how hard I had been pushing myself and I knew my life was on the right track I wasn't about to mess it up.  
  
I turned around after collecting my food. That's when she caught me off guard, sending my meal plummeting to the floor. Her hands gripped tightly around my neck. Again came the ringing ears.  
  
"What's the matter? Don't you follow the doctor's orders?" she whispered. "If you gave up this food you wouldn't need your Niacin anymore."  
  
My eyes widened and my lungs ceased to draw breath. Why wasn't anyone helping? I was in the middle of a crowded place. And first this thing new about my grades, now she knew my medical history? How deep did this creature's well of knowledge of me go? To the top? How far back? Every other encounter had been from a distance, but not this one. If I was ever going to stop this thing, now was my chance, while they were physically near me; to bring them down in front of everyone and uncloak them to the entire world, or just McDonald's. With every ounce of strength, I could muster in my entire body I began to fight back. I screamed and I pulled and I yanked her hands or what might as well have been the jaws of life.  
  
"Get away from me you crazy bitch!" I triumphantly shouted as I threw the greatest right hook I probably ever achieved in my life. My victory was short-lived though. The manager and two McDonald's employees were wrestling me to the ground.  
  
"Hey take it easy, if you don't calm down we're gonna have to call the police!"  
  
"Yeah no kidding!" I said. "That lady over here just attacked me. She's laughing at me I can hear her laughing at me!" My attacker, lying face down on the floor after my punch stood up and turned to face me. Suddenly, she was gone, and standing before me was an elderly Hispanic male, nowhere near close to a soul-stirring sickly, frightening caucasian female.  
  
Here we are now. As soon as they loosened their grip I got the hell out of dodge. I wasn't sticking around to get arrested. Screw going to class, honestly, screw going out. It can get me any time anywhere. Has anyone out there dealt with this before? I don't know what else to do. I've locked all my doors and sealed all my windows. It can appear and disappear in and out of anybody. I don't know who to trust or if I can even trust myself. I was in the bathroom looking in the mirror before. And there she was. She looked like me, but it was her voice, she wasn't fooling me. My pills plummeted from the medicine cabinet down the sink's drain: Xanax, Vyvanse, and Niacin were all gone in a flash. A low manical laugh followed by that guttural whisper taunted me.  
  
"I have been every voice that you have ever heard inside of your head!"
