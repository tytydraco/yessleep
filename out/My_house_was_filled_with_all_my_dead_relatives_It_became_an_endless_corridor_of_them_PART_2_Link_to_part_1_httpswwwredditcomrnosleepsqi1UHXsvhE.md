It’s been around a year since the incident 
I have been living in peace, up until now. Today i awake finding myself not in my room. But an endless white corridor with terrifying screeching noises, and when it is not that. Voices that i am unfamiliar with, in a language i am not convinced is real. There are signs in this place with arrows pointing me in a continuous straight line. But these arrows… they lead to nowhere, at one point i attempted to turn around and walk the opposite way, but i could not go anywhere. And now i feel as though something is behind me. I cannot go or look that way again. Every now and then the trail of the white corridor pauses as i get lost in memories of everything that has occurred, my family, the life i live, even the incident has finally entered its way into my memories, even though i had never been able to remember it before. Every now and then i think i descend into madness, i seem to be thinking that a way out keeps appearing with the same heavy breathing noise each time. But as i reach it it disappears, but it still excites me each time i see it. I don’t know what the goal here is, atleast last time i had something to do and people i knew i had to save. But this time, it almost feels as though i am being punished, being driven into insanity walking the same corridor over and over again.

It has been awhile since i wrote, and up until now things hadnt changed but now things have become even stranger. The direction of the arrows changed and directed me to turn right. So i do this, intrigued to finally venture into something hopefully different. And the white corridor fades away, into what looks like just an average room of a house, i do look around to see if it could be mine but it is not. It is just an empty room with a slightly opened door. At first it is just darkness, i could not even see where i was going. Until i felt as though i was losing control of my body. At that point i continued blinking as normal but after one blink, i noticed a light, that light continued growing and i noticed i was falling. But i could not stop myself, i had lost complete control. I had found myself to be in… space?
I had visited so many planets, yet unable to move and nobody being able to see me. It was crazy seeing people on other planets living life regularly. And these worlds look so similar to ours. But for so long i had been told my next destination was Earth. But as i became closer to it, something went wrong and i drifted apart from it. I was sucked to the right of it before i continued falling. I now knew i would never be returning home. But i was just told one more planet left, “Planet Axy, This Is Our Final Destination.” I do not know what i should expect here, maybe i will return home after all. Or maybe this is the end.

We here at Planet Axy have received a newcomer, we do not know how long he has been making his way to our home, but what we can confirm is, is that he is dead. We would hope that somebody else from wherever this reaches would make their way here and collect your friend, as he is unwanted here and we have no way of disposing of him.
