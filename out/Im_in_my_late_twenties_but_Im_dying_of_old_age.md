It was my last night south of the Rio Grande. I’d taken off a few days of work to attend my friend Juan’s wedding. It was a nice time. But sad, too. After the bells finished ringing, after the rice was scattered and the bride’s bouquet thrown, Juan was going to stay in his home country and run his father’s copper factory.

Every wedding happens in the season of last hurrahs.

“Listen, it’s not like you can’t come back and visit sometime.” I didn’t know the woman who was talking to me very well. But I knew her well enough: Maggie. We’d just kept running into eachother in the hotel lobby bar. Each night we’d end up drinking curtain call cocktails before I dragged myself back to my room and off to sleep. She was probably fifty years older than me. It was the sort of strange, temporary friendship native to resort properties. “This is just life, darling,” she said. “This is the next stage of life.”

“I don’t know, Mags,” I said. “Everyone’s getting married, everyone’s getting married. Everyone except for me.”

She was tall and thin, and even in the swelter of the Yucatán, her silver-white hair kept near-perfect. “Don’t you want to get married someday?”

“I’m ambivalent. Tell me, how did you like it?” I said.

“I can tell you this much,” she leaned back into her barstool’s back as she crossed her legs, “I’ve been married four times, so I’m rather good at it.”

I laughed. But my laughter made me no less sad. Maggie could tell, I was sure.

She patted my shoulder like those little league coaches who believe in trophies for losers. “You’re going to be alright, Sam.”

“I just kind of wish everyone was at the same stage of their life. Me and all my friends. It’s these liminal periods—some people getting married, some with kids already, some who’ve sworn off ever having kids. I don’t fit in with any of them.”

“The old ‘neither fish nor foul’ conundrum.”

“I guess.”

“You know—” Maggie fished around in her handbag. It was understated, but “HERMÈS | PARIS | MADE IN FRANCE” was stamped above the twist clasp “—that peddler on the beach today. He was selling amulets—”

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

“He gave me this one.” She pulled a bronze coin the size of a silver dollar out of her purse. It had a hole drilled through the top of the coin and a red ribbon tied right through it. She handed it to me.

“What did he say it’s for?” I asked.

Maggie shrugged. “He said it was for good luck in love. Though I can count on one hand the totems that don’t make the same claim. Love’s the eternal promise we all want to rely on. Like a lucky rabbit’s foot on a gambler’s keychain.”

I looked at the coin’s relief. It showed a bearded, naked old man holding a scythe. The old man was standing inside a wheel with symbols all around it. Above the relief, there was Greek text: “Χρόνος”. Except it was upside down. I didn’t know Greek, but I’d taken enough humanities courses to know the letters weren’t facing the way they were supposed to.

“Why’s it in Greek and not Spanish?”

Maggie shrugged. “It’s probably a drachma some Athenian tourist dropped in a mariachi’s upturned hat. I’m sure the peddler was the last stop on the path of a thousand cash registers. He probably dressed it up so other tourists thought there was some mystical Mayan hoodoo to it.”

“Why’d you buy it, if it’s a scam?”

“I don’t think it’s a scam. I never said it was a scam. I think it’s a story. Here,” she said, handing it to me. “You keep it. It’ll make you think of beaches scattered with white sand, conquistadors and vaqueros, a tequila sunrise; and kindly old divorcées, of course.”

I smiled and put it in my pocket. “Thanks Mags.”

“Think nothing of it. You’re a good boy, Sam. Now, I’m about to turn into a pumpkin. So give old Mother Maggie a squeeze before I’m off to Bedfordshire. We'll likely never see one another again.”

I hugged her. “Don’t say things like that. Even if they’re true.”

“Darling, I’m too old to lie,” she said as she dismounted her barstool, using my arm to steady herself. “It’s a luxury of getting old: I can indulge myself in that indecorous breach of manners called ‘honesty’.”

“It’s been a pleasure, Mags. I’ll always remember you.”

“Oh, I know you will, Sam. I know you will.”

I didn’t think about it then, but it was sort of strange for her to say it like that.

Lots of things make more sense looking back.

On the flight home, there was a group of elderly tourists, almost all of them wearing crucifixes. They filled up half the airplane. A church group, probably. I was seated next to one of these white-haired born-agains up in first class.

“You know, you remind me of my nephew. He runs a very successful HVAC company. Do you do ductwork?”

“Actually, I’m in sales,” I said.

“Oh. HVAC sales?”

“No, ma’am. Non-fungible tokens.”

“Well, I’m not sure I know what that is.”

“That’s alright, nobody does. I don’t either.”

She chuckled. “Oh, you really are like my nephew. He’s cheeky, too.”

“I’ve been called worse.”

They turned down the lights and closed the cabin window shades right after drink service. My neighbor fell asleep right away, and soon I started to drift away, too. I worried Maggie’s amulet between my fingers and thumb as I drifted. My eyelids grew heavy. I fell asleep with the coin in my hand.

•

I woke up. My elderly seatmate was staring at me. She had just about one of the nastiest looks I’d ever seen on a human being’s face. It was a hellacious stink eye; the look of hatred that comes from the bowels, a malice otherwise reserved for family court custody battles.

I rubbed sleep from my eyes and pulled up in my chair. “Ma’am, are you okay?”

She sneered at me. “Everybody knows that you’re a liar,” she said. “And a cunt.”

“Excuse me?”

“I think you should eat shit. Do you hear me, cocksucker? I think you should eat shit!” She scratched my face so hard I could hear the streaks of flesh come off under her nails. The smell and texture of blood freshly coated my face. I looked at her—I was stunned beyond comprehension.

The nice little old church lady shrieked like a carnivore. “You’re the one who took him,” she said, spitting at my bloodied face. She took her purse and walloped me right on the nose, splashing some of my blood on her lips and cheeks. I could see blood on her teeth, too, coloring her mad snarl red. “You lying piece of shit!” She fumbled at me with her thumbs, trying to gouge my eyes out. “Killer-cocksucker-killer!” I put my hands up to defend myself and she tried to bite my fingers. “You’re the one who took my husband. You murdering cunt!”

The flight attendants and someone else from her church group rushed towards us and immediately restrained her.

I switched spots with another born-again who was in a single seat across the aisle.

“Oh, sir! Don’t forget your—your thing.” The flight attendant picked up the amulet and handed it to me; it glimmered as she placed it in my palm. As the coin changed hands, every single churchgoing grandparent looked at me like I was the actual, historical killer of Christ Jesus on earth.

I tucked the amulet into the coin pocket of my wallet. As soon as I did, every elderly Christian fell back into saintly serenity.

And once I’d put it away, I just about forgot it was there.

•

The next day I woke up much earlier than I should have. My clock radio showed five a.m., a good two hours before my alarm called Reveille.

It was a little annoying that I couldn’t get back to sleep. But I figured I’d read the yet-unread novel I’d bought in the airport. When I cracked the spine and started in on it, though, I could hardly make out the words. It was like reading the bottom row of the eye exam the DMV gives new licensees.

I watched the news instead. But it felt like there was cotton in my ears. I had to turn the volume up so high that it wasn’t worth the anxiety I had over bothering my neighbors. I turned off the TV.

I gave up on spending my early bird hours on self-enrichment. Instead, I showered, got dressed, and grabbed my wallet, keys and phone. I headed to the office.

•

I didn’t feel so hot most of the day. I couldn’t eat more than half a banana for lunch. My afternoon slump felt more like drought or famine. My body screamed for a nap.

I dragged myself to the bathroom to splash water on my face.

I inspected my wet face in the mirror and winced at the sight of it. I looked godawful. The little bit of salt that dusted the pepper in my hair had turned into two whole salt licks on the side of my head. There were veins bulging through toadish bags under my eyes. There were sunspots on my skin I’d somehow missed before. I looked…

Old.

Chip, my boss, came out of one of the stalls and started washing his hands in the sink to my left. He kept sneaking looks at me through the wall-wide mirror behind the sink.

“What?” I said.

“Sam, I don’t want to sound like a dick, but…you really look terrible, man. Are you coming down with something?”

“I—I don’t think so, no.”

“How are you feeling?” Chip said. “Right now, I mean.”

“Right now?”

“Yeah.”

“I mean, I’m a little fatigued, I guess,” I said.

Chip tugged a few sheets of paper towel from the dispenser and wrung his hands in them. “Buddy, don’t take this the wrong way, but you look like you slept inside a cardboard box last night. Maybe you have a virus. I think you ought to take a sick day. Maybe sleep through the weekend, just come back fresh next Monday.”

“But I was off more than half of the week already. I just got back.”

Chip frowned. “Listen, man. It’s not a suggestion. You look like hammered shit. Go home and come back on Monday. I don’t want people to see you in the office. Christ, Sam, you look like a corpse.”

It was a busy corner. On one end there was the dark tide of mourners—pallbearers in black suits bought off the rack, the padre with his surplice and stole, women in sensible pumps or Mary Janes, their hems below the knee; the good modesty that attends to obsequies. Across the street there was a bum with a cardboard sign reading: “NEED MONEY FOR PENIS REDUCTION SURGERY”. Children on a field trip were tethered to each other on a safety rope with two-dozen rungs, like baby sloths clinging to their mama under the rainforest canopy.

“Change!” The vagrant saving up for his urologic surgical procedure called out with the self-satisfaction of a man who can still smirk even while living in a sleeping bag on a public sidewalk.

I pulled the amulet out to start worrying it again. Or maybe I thought I was going to flick it into the bum’s empty coffee canister.

Looking back, I wonder why I didn’t think of the amulet. Should I have known? Could I have known? Mags was such a sweet, old lady, after all…

Someone called out from inside the shadow of the church. “He’s the one who killed him. Look at him, he’s the one who did it!”

I searched for the screamer and who they were screaming at. The stream of mourners clogged the church steps. Everyone old enough to collect Social Security stared at me like they’d caught me letting my dog shit on their lawn. I could see (and feel, too) every old-timer boiling over with unaccountable fury.

People started yelling at me from the church entrance: “Piece of shit” and “murderer”, “Judas” and “abomination”; and of course, the ubiquitous “cocksucker”. They called me every name in the book.

I didn’t know what the first congregant’s intention was when I saw him step out into traffic. Two more mourners followed and blocked the uptown flow. Workaday humps hollered from their box trucks. A village of cabbies started riding their horns.

The mourners stopping traffic as they crossed the street all had more people drafting behind them. A human tide of grandparenthood gray and funereal black surged angry across the street, indifferent to gridlock and pedestrian traffic offenses.

I finally realized: They were yelling at me. And they were angry enough to block the whole street. To look at their faces, half the funeral’s attendees wanted to wring my sorry neck.

I turned and I ran, clutching the amulet.

I think of that moment and wonder why I didn’t drop it. Maybe I didn’t know what it was yet. Or maybe it kept me from knowing so what happened would be sure to happen.

My heart was machine-gunning in my chest and my lungs were on fire. I reached my sixth city block in a row of straight sprinting.

A box truck pulled around a loading dock wall. It was right in my path, right in my blind spot. Its rear end clipped my side. I spun. I tried to stay upright, to keep running, but the momentum carried me into a cartwheel. I lifted off my feet. I bowling-balled across the pavement, scoring my face and hands with roadrash.

The tumbling heap of my body rolled to a stop. I heard near-silence with a faint ringtone beneath it, like I’d been concussed. I reached up and touched my head. It was bleeding. I didn’t know where I was busted open, where the blood came from, exactly. I just knew I was bleeding.

I turned just as the first mourner caught up with me. His mirror-shiny black shoe caught me in my teeth. There was a white-black flash as my brain rattled inside my skull.

“Sto—” I started but was stopped from finishing. Another man punched me in the lip hard enough to split it—I heard one of his fingers break against my teeth. His finger crunched as he howled in pain.

I was dazed and down on my back. I looked up. I saw the priest in his funereal vestments, swinging something at the end of a gold chain. He lassoed a heavy, metal object over his head. And then he brought it right down into my skull.

When I woke up two weeks later, I would learn that what he’d hit me with was called a “censer”.

•

I opened my eyes and saw the world swimming around me. My nerves were chicken-fried with pain; bruises and gashes like they’d been boiled in oil. And it didn’t just hurt where I’d been beaten on my body. It was my bones that ached, too, right down to the marrow. I could feel my veins constricting, like there were tiny rubber bands squeezing every bloody branch.

The world was slow to come into focus.

There was something in my mouth. I touched it—rigid plastic giving way to a more pliant polyethylene. I pinched my nose and felt another rubbery tube.

I panicked. I moved to extubate myself, to yank the foreign object out of my trachea. But my wrists were velcroed inside cushioned restraints.

“Try not to jerk yourself around so much. You’re still healing.” It was a female voice.

I saw a young woman who I was sure I’d never seen before but who seemed very familiar.

Who the hell are you? Where the hell am I? I thought but couldn’t say with the tube in my throat. Instead, I made a sound like a lowing cow.

“They really worked you over,” she said through a haze of cigarette smoke. “Usually it takes longer before the geriatrics can smell him on you. You must be special.”

Tall, natural ice-blonde with Scandinavian skin like heavy cream and eyes the color of glacial ice. A mini dress hugged her body like something from Hervé Léger, nipples apexed from the center of breasts immune to gravity and screaming through her bustline. She had a tennis pro’s legs. I could see the outline of ribs along her sides and felt the stupid lust that only lonely men can feel.

Her voice exuded an easy superiority, the self-possession of someone who’d been beautiful from the cradle and was likely to stay a stunner almost all the way to the grave.

“Still a little foggy?” she said. She held up the coin that Mother Maggie gave me before we said our goodbyes at the edge of the Yucatán, a lightning bolt glimmer of gold reflected over her eyes. “Don’t worry, I’m not repoing your amulet. I just…” She lost the thread before picking it back up. “Well, I’m nostalgic, I suppose. This twinkling little disk took me on quite the rollercoaster ride. I shined you on, as I guess you might know by now. And I suppose you’ll have figured out that this isn’t a drachma. And that I didn’t barter it away from a rag-and-bone man hawking wares on the beach.”

It took a minute for my brain to work it out. She knew where the amulet came from. She knew it was a gift to me.

I knew this woman.

I saw it in my mind, like a transparency laid one on top of the other, lighting a whiteboard through a science class projector: Maggie’s face and this woman’s face—the Greek nose, Snow Queen eyes, ears a touch too big for her skull. It was the same face, except that one had been through a near-century more of rainy days.

Maggie saw the realization I came to, saw it in my face, saw my reaction before I myself realized what I was reacting to: I was looking at Maggie; and she was young.

She laughed with the natural cruelty of a sultress. “Yes, darling. I suppose I lied when I said we’d likely never see one another again. But forget all that, I don’t have much time. Frankly, none of us have enough time. Which is why I borrowed some of yours.”

I groaned but couldn’t make any real noise. I bucked against my restraints.

Maggie glided cooly toward the IV bag with its line running into my arm. She injected something into the pouch. I fell into a dark softness.

“Ah, better. That’s much, much better, darling.” She sat back down to luxuriate in her cigarette smoke. “So here’s how it goes, Sam. You are now on Chronos’s time. And the big man works in billable hours. If you can get someone else to pick up the check, as you picked up mine (and thank you for that), you’ll always look twenty-five years old and live for as many generations. But if not…” She tapped her wristwatch. “Tick-tock, tick-tock. The more time goes by, the riper Chronos’s scent on your soul. And the oldsters quite easily catch the scent. It maddens them. Makes them want to stamp eternity’s stink out of you. People who are nearing the end of their lifespan are not fans of Father Time. That’s why anyone with gray hair has been trying to kill you. See? They can smell his malediction oozing through your pores.”

She smiled. I saw the predator of her true nature lurk behind her eyes. My eyes felt hot and wet; the wet heat stung the still-healing abrasions covering my face. I realized I was crying.

An emergency code alert went off. Maggie turned over the back of her chair and looked through the blinds of my room’s glass window. A flock of physicians and nurses flew across the ward.

“There goes another one turning early off the turnpike. Must’ve been hard up for the toll,” she said, turning back to face me again. An Irish waterfall of blue-gray smoke flumed from her nose to her mouth. She sucked it down and blew back out a perfect ring. “Sam…my advice? Find someone else to take your place. Get yourself a patsy and foist the amulet off on them. You know what they say, ‘Shit rolls downhill.’”

Maggie stood up from her chair and dropped her cigarette on the floor before stubbing it out with the toe of her stiletto. “You can make yourself young again, and you can stay young,” she said, turning the amulet in her hand as she walked to my bedside. “But Father Time isn’t very keen on debt forgiveness, so don’t wait too long before you get started.” She winked at me and flicked the coin, sent it spinning through the air before it landed on my chest. “It’s lovely to see you again, Sam. And if it’s any consolation, I really do like you. If you make it into eternity with the rest of us, go ahead and look me up.”

Maggie turned to leave my room but stopped at the threshold. “I almost forgot.” She turned on her heels and came back to my bedside, then fished a compact mirror from her purse. She clicked it open and said, “Just a teensy-weensy little looksie, Sam; a little flare under your derrière. Remember, what you see is only the beginning. So shake a leg and find your fall guy.” She laughed that cruel laugh. “Or gal.”

She held the compact mirror in front of my face. If I’d been able to, I would have screamed. I looked at least ninety years old.
