I've never been the type of person that enjoys spending the night at a friends house. Im fine with sleeping over at a relatives, but sleeping with a friend has always been a bit foreign to me. This might come as a surprise, considering I'm currently 16 years old. But that does make some sense sense I don't really have many friends anyways. In fact, I truthfully only have one person who I call my friend. Her name is Elia. She's like a sister to me, she understands me very well and is super fun to hang out with. She has long straight brown hair and blue eyes. She kinda looks like my mom who passed a way a few years ago. However, that isn't important.

Elia once asked If I wanted to come spend the night the upcoming weekend. I was a bit surprised as she had never asked this in the past. I was also very nervous. I didn't want to say yes because I was afraid it would go horribly wrong or something. I thought I'd end up ruining it or making a bad impression in front of her parents. She was my best friend though so I reluctantly agreed. 

Our car pulled up into there driveway, Elia was waiting for me smiling in front of her house. Her house was pretty nice. It was two stories high and much bigger than mine. I walked up to Elia who looked very exited to see me. Her parents were standing behind her with very inviting smiles. After greeting me they went to introduce themself's to my parents. In the meantime me and Elia walked inside. She gave me a brief tour of her house before we made it to her room. So far, everything was going fine. 

Me and Elia played on her play station for a while, we were getting really competitive in game. thats when I turned and notice a bunch of intense scratches all over her door. They looked fairly new and If Im being honest it kind of worried me. But I decided I was probably over thinking it which is something I do a lot.

After a while Elias mom came in. 

"Its getting late, you guys need to get in bed now."

Elia has two twin beds in her room, both next to each other just a little bit apart from one another. We each got in bed and turned off the lights.

"Good night, Sara. Sleep well." she said tiredly.

"Good night." I replied slowly drifting off. 

I quickly fell asleep to what I'd hope would be sweet dreams. I slept more deeply than usual, and my dreams weren't filled with fear and worry.

"My favorite hobby is writing."

My eyes opened and my body instantly became cold. I jerked my head of my pillow and screamed at the horrific sight. Elia was standing up watching me in bed. her face was extremely pale, as if she had a fever. Her brown hair hung down on the sides of her head and she had absolutely no expression. she was just looking down at me with this pale, pale eyes.

"I really like foxes. My favorite hobby is writing." She said

I was so frozen with fear that I couldn't even come up with a response. What was she even talking about? I instantly got out of bed and ran out of the room. That might sounds like a stupid thing to do but Im a very fearful person and when you're so scared you cant think straight. Once I exited the room I could hear Elia yelling after me. Her calls sounded like crying and yells at the same time.

I began to run down the hall trying to ignore the horrible yells. Eventually I made it to Elias parents room to tell them about the situation. I quickly opened the door and the sight I saw made my heart skip a beat. Both Elias parents were standing next to each other with their faces looking at me. It was as if they were waiting for me to open the door. My mouth opened but I couldn't make out any words. They were both just standing there watching me. 

Finally I came to my senses and moved from the scene. The moment that I left from their view they began to yell. The same terrifying yell Elia let out. I eventually found their bathroom and locked myself in. I checked the clock, It was 3:14 AM. I hoped they wouldn't find me. but they did. I nearly jumped as the three of them began banging on the bathroom door, pleading me to open the door. However, as time went on their pleads began to turn into angry demands. I couldn't help but sit there crying with my hands over my eyes. I had no Idea what was going on.

Eventually their cries died off. But I didn't open the door, I waited for the sun to come out. Once It did I opened the bathroom door and left. I made my way past all of the bedrooms and out of the house. I didn't want to see any of their faces again. I ended up cutting all connection with them as the entire scenario was very traumatizing for me. Once again, I am a very fearful person. 

That was four years ago and I haven't heard from them sense. However, I did recently get a text from an anonymous number saying "I really like foxes. My favorite hobby is writing." I just hope it's not what I think it is.
