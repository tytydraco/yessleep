I was born in Shandong province, China. I have a twin brother, we share the same childhood and teenager time until 18. The post here is based on my real experience and my brother is on the spot at that time. I reconfirmed from him several times that the experience wasn't a dream or some illumination my brain imagined. 

The story happened before 2008, which is at least 15 years ago. My brother and I were less than 10 years old. At that time, my family moved to Wangshe, which is at south of Zhangdian, Zibo. Our apartment was on the fifth floor of the buiding. I share the same bedroom with my brother for a long time. During that time, we can always see a human-shaped light spot passing our window. That light spot seemed to have no interest staying outside window, everytime we saw it, it passed our window quickly. It was really weird since we are on the fifth floor. We were not sure wheather what we saw was real, and we were not even sure wheather what we saw was in human-shape. Until one day, we got closer to it and we confirmed what it looks like.

That was a hot summer night, the bats were flying in the low sky catching insects. We were playing with our friends in front of the building's unit door. It should be noted that at that time, the house was allocated by the company so there were many friends of my parents living in the same area. Therefore, we have many kid friends at that place. And since we played here all the time so my parents at home weren't so worry about us. I can't remember when did we found the light spot. Or specifically, it wasn't a light spot, it was a shining human, seating on the stone chair in the center of the grass field. One of the kids found it and yelled at it, but there was no response. Then we decided to move towards it. As we move closer to that light spot, we can see it clearer. It was shining, but in a weird way. It is composed with ellipses which have different colors, while the ellipses together form a human shaped THING. Hereafter, we call it the ellipse man. The ellipse man again had no response to our approaching, it still seated there with its hands put in front of the stone desk. As we approached the ellipse man, there was an awful smell. We didn't want to get any closer and we decided to go back home to tell our parents. However, when we are back home we observed from the front window that the ellipse man had gone away. 

Once I told this story to one of my friends who lived far from our building. He didn't believe it at the firtst time. I remember one day, he came to our house as a guest and we enjoyed our dinner together. When my parents were preparing dinner in the kitchen, my friend an I went into the kitchen to find something to eat. And we saw the ellipse man flying across the window. My friend was frightened and my parents seemed to see nothing. He finally believed what I told him and I sent him back home that night.

This ellipse man seemed to be safe to me since it never tried to bother me. At most it flew across the window and with nothing else done. Later around 2008, we moved out of that area and I have never seen ellipse man since then. I have experenced so many weird things and that was one of two most stricken memories in my life so far.
