Hey all. Not feeling too good about this part, I have been in contact with this fellow Plucketville resident and she has been able to confirm that she did in fact live in the same town.

Her name is Dr Helen Gracewater, she worked in the hospital and therefore knows a lot more than I do about these Elves. I asked her to write a chunk of this part but she told me,

“Jacob, finish your details and then decide if you want to hear the truth.”

At first I was confused about what that meant and inquired further, Helen then simply sent,

“When you read what I send you, just remember it’s not your fault, don’t give up, be strong.”

Hancock tells me I should live in ignorant bliss and so did a reader of part 1, maybe it’s what’s for the best? 

Anyway, let’s finish off my life in Plucketville.

**18-21:**

The rest of my 17th year was me deciding when I wanted to leave and initially it was the moment I turned 18, then my 18th birthday rolled around and I couldn’t make myself leave.

I told Sarah about my plan to leave during my 18th birthday party, she flipped out at me and acted like I should know what was so bad about leaving. I remember saying, “Sarah, I will call you everyday, I will visit every month at least once!”

She shot me a hideous look, not of sadness but rage, rage against someone who just admitted they cheated, “No you dumbass, the spirits will never forgive you. They will punish me just for supporting you!”

The mention of spirits made my blood run cold, hideous, gagging beetles. They were so integral to my life up to that point but when I finally interacted with them they just made me sick.

If they were these wandering travellers that needed to be respected why couldn’t they speak, why did they look so revolting? Why did Sarah’s family fear them so much to bolt their eyes shut? All of it made me fear these elves and I admittedly lost that childhood respect and wonder I once had, “Who gives a fuck about the spirits? This is my life! I just want a good education, not taught about some fucking Gods in the same fucking school everyone else is!”

She belted me across the face, it stung like I had pressed it against a warming stove, I fell to the ground. As I looked up to her angered face I saw something in her eyes that I couldn’t explain, but I could understand. Just as Sarah told me about Michael’s Mum, “She knows something we don’t.”

Whatever was scaring Sarah so much was real to her, it was something I needed to respect, something I needed to understand and not be mad at Sarah for. “Sorry.” I pathetically mumbled out, it was genuine, I was genuinely so sorry for even offering the silly idea of leaving.

The next few years I genuinely gave up on the idea of leaving. For the longest time I told myself it was for my love of Sarah, who I did love, I loved beyond anything I could fathom but now recounting my life, it’s beyond that.

The rest of the year my mind was dedicated to sucking up to Sarah and fearing my mother. Sarah and I sorted out the fight the very next day, she understood why I wanted to leave and I understood that she was scared.

My mother on the other hand continued to bring up my birth, saying random anecdotes like;

“They were so kind to me there, gentle!”

“I know it looks scary but the auditors are really wonderful doctors!”

“Please don’t leave us, you haven’t even had the chance to have your own child!”

I tried to ignore her and these strange statements but they were daily. I would walk out of my room in the morning and she would mention something bizarre about God or the hospital or beg me not to leave. Inescapable madness spewed forth from her mouth.

On my 19th birthday my Dad brought me up to the roof and we shared a beer. Looking at the stars he said something that stuck with me, even when I didn’t fully get it, even before I had an anchor like Hancock, it was just nice to hear.

“Jake, listen. You really love Sarah?”

“Yeah, of course.”

“Then, then never let go of her. I don’t know if God is real, or this world was just formed as beautiful as it but whatever created it, created us, and it created her. You met her so long ago, such a young age and you’ve clung together, don’t separate, don’t fuck things up.” 

He took a long sip of his beer, I watched his eyes well with tears, his lip trembling. “A couple years before you were born, I nearly left, I nearly left your mother and headed somewhere south, I don’t know where I would have gone but I knew why. I was scared, I was scared of being a father, I was scared of not being good enough, of not listening in class, I was horrified that I missed something important in my life and I just needed to go, fuck off all the way down to Tasmania. The day I was leaving, bags packed in secret, I took a look at your mother, I looked at her smile, I looked at the bags forming under her eyes and I analysed the imperfections in her teeth. I loved her, I loved her so much and my fears faded.”

He looked to me for response, “That’s beautiful Dad.”

He smiled his kind, strong smile he has, “Are you afraid Jacob?”

“Yeah.”

“Of what?”

“Of not getting a proper education and not seeing the world. I’m afraid I’m gonna miss out I guess.”

He took one last sip of the beer and threw the bottle to land on the grass of the front yard, “Then look at Sarah’s imperfections, look at what this world created and your fears will fade. So long as you have her, stay. Stay and appreciate the beauty you have here, appreciate the ugliness of Plucketville, the ugliness of your family, so long as you have Sarah don’t let your fears scare you off.”

“And if I ever lose her?”

My Dad’s smile faded into a solemn look, “Fuck off south, all the way to Tasmania.”

After that my Mum stopped hounding me with her odd comments and I truly lost all fear of missing the world. Sarah was my world. 

I got a job at a local cafe and Sarah started studying at P.U.R. It was going so well and by 20 we had moved out together.

Once again Hancock has informed me the following information is not normal so I will be careful to explain every detail.

When we bought the house we sent in a local priest, he wore brown robes and carried a cross. He had to be the first to open the back door, blessing it as he entered, “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven!” 

He wandered through our entire house and every once in a while he would stop and pray for a moment. Questioning this act he explained that they were God’s, “Greeting points,” and, “Need to be opened just like your back door.”

Finally he waited in our home each night until he caught a glimpse of God then he vanished, blessing us with the keys to our new home.

Hancock asked me how I managed to buy an entire house for my age so I will explain to you what I needed to explain to him. Houses in Plucketville are disgustingly cheap, cheaper than they should be. Not only because of the likelihood of a break in but also because it’s seen as a sin to be homeless, it makes the streets look filthy and uninviting. So the houses were only around $5,000 to $10,000.

Sarah and my new house had no extra laundry or space to keep break ins from occurring so our home was open for the slaughter. 

To account for this she put aside her belief of needing every single door removed and settled for just the back door being open. We quickly installed a lock on our bedroom door, which did in fact jiggle once or twice a month.

We would drag all expensive things into our safe haven of a room each night which was quite the hassle but we wouldn’t dare risk any of those items from being stolen.

By 21, Sarah and I were settled. Our routine had been essentially automated, I got the heavy stuff and she picked up the easy to miss smaller items. The lower portion of our cupboard was for the smaller items and we used the bigger items and a spare blanket as our beside table. 

Whenever I would hear an elusive door knob jiggle I would yell and scream until I heard the person leave, had a cricket bat by the bed for the off chance someone was cocky. 

If they didn’t scatter or I heard a gurgling gulp I would remain silent and still, knowing that some curious spirits wanted to see what was beyond the threshold of the wooden frame.

At the end of the year Sarah started falling ill. It was cancer, lung cancer from her Mum’s secondhand smoke, she got so sick so quickly. Doctors gave her a high chance of surviving but for some reason it wouldn’t get better. 

In the course of 2 months she became so frail, her wrists so thin, her eye sockets so deep. My world was ending. I once again became scared.

**22-24:**

These years are the hardest my life ever held. Recounting them to Hancock his fear deformed into apologetic sadness. I promise there’s still some weirdness for the fans of that but admittedly the only thing I was afraid of during these final years was the cancer. The self formed parasite, growing violently outward of Sarah’s lungs, stripping her of life and making her life so agonising. 

I never understood cancer, why was it so common? Why does nearly every animal experience it? Such a violent and deadly thing should have evolved out before humans crested Earth with their sinful feet but it’s a pest that even millions of adaptations of trillions of animals could never eradicate. A weed so enrooted into DNA that to remove it would remove the very species it was connected to. Hard coded into all life. 

Cancer. Even the word is harsh and disgusting to look at.

Sarah survived for another couple of years. 22 was hard, she had to drop out of university and her parents somehow blamed us for not unscrewing every hinge of every door. They had the audacity to claim that this was a punishment brought on by our disrespect for the spirits.

I wish I could have stopped speaking to them, just ignore them for the rest of my life but Sarah’s light was fading and if I removed them from our lives Sarah would die with no family by her side.

Sarah’s illness was compounded by the fact she found medicinal help scary. She believed in it and knew it would work but when you grow up in a religious only household your entire life, it instills values and beliefs that are nearly impossible to shake.

She would sometimes be too scared to take her medication asking, “If God really does find this stuff sinful and I die anyway, will I go to hell?”

I had to convince her that God loves free will and forgives all who choose to use it. I also reminded her that religion is so heavily connected with healing the sick and hospitals. The red cross stems from the cross that Jesus died upon. Jesus being fake or not, his direct connection to religion indicates that the Gods must respect medicine.

Then she started to doubt her own faith, this wasn’t something I could easily remedy. I didn’t fully believe in these Gods, I had doubts and fear around them. I couldn’t convince her there was even a heaven, that her views were leading to a peaceful afterlife. I tried to convince her, I would look up passages in the bible, I would get information from her parents and my Mum but nothing would quell her fears. She was dying, in pain, scared and miserable.

One morning, I think it was just before I turned 23, I gave up. I entered our room, I looked at her frail body, pale skin, bony wrists and weak smile and just asked, “What can I do? What will make you less scared?”

She and I discussed for hours, finding ways to prove that heaven was real, to alleviate that horrifying feeling that she was plummeting headfirst into nothing. A void of no sensation, no thought, no feelings, no time, no Sarah. Nothing.

There was no way to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, I would need a picture of heaven or an angel. 

Then it clicked, “What if I showed you a picture of God?”

She just giggled in response so I asked again, “God? I think I have a picture of one.”

“A picture of the Gods?” She asked, still laughing softly.

“Not the Gods, just one, an auditor, an elf, a spirit.”

She grinned a small grin, “Oh yes, but I wouldn’t let you look at it. You aren’t supposed to look at the spirits.”

“I won’t need to.” I said as I kissed the top of her head and rushed to my car.

I realised that even though spirits were so ingrained in her life that she had never seen one. She had heard the soft gurgle, she had been told stories and forced to feed them but her own eyes could never prove they were real, she was simply too scared to check.

I got home and found my Dad. I demanded he get me that photo he once dropped, the one with me as a baby and the thing looming in the doorway.

He made me promise I would only show Sarah and never look at it myself.

“Why? I’ve already seen it?”

“You glimpsed it, you shouldn’t look at them too long, it’s not good for you.” He responded, he always seemed to know more than he let on.

Everyone seemed to know more than I did, like I was out of the loop entirely. Why did everyone know these nuanced rules about the elves, why did nobody let me leave Plucketville, why was everyone so certain they needed to leave their backdoor open? 

These ideas were so quickly drowned out by the distant pained cries of my dying love, so I rushed home. The picture flipped upside down on the passenger seat, where Sarah would sit on our drives together, where she hadn’t sat in a year.

I arrived and found her resting, fast asleep, the only thing she could consistently do without issue. I sat beside her, flicking the picture with my index finger, my curiosity begging me to just have one last look but I didn’t, I promised my Dad I would never.

An hour later she woke up, saw me on the edge of the bed, facing the blank, shadowed wall.

“Jake, are you okay?” She asked.

I turned to look at her. She was a corpse. “Yeah, I was just waiting for you to wake up.”

“Is that it?” She asked, scooting slowly over, her eyes fixated on the polaroid.

“Yeah hon, this is it,” I said, staring at her beautiful eyes, “here’s your proof.”

I handed it to her, even this thin slip of plastic seemed to be heavy in her grip, her hands shook as she slowly turned it to face her. I saw the excitement on her face fade to confusion and finally fear. “These are the spirits?”

I nodded.

“Michael was right, we shouldn’t let them in.” She dropped the picture and it fluttered to face down on the bed, “Please Jake, please close the door.”

“No Sarah,” I said in reluctant defiance, “I won’t let us upset that thing.”

“It shouldn’t be in our house!” She blurted out, louder than she had been in months, “Don’t let them in, please!”

I placed my hand on her leg and I smiled as best as I could, “Be not afraid, that’s what the angels say right? Be not afraid? Maybe this is why they say it?”

She shook her head, “That isn’t a fucking angel.”

“Then what is it?”

“The devil.”

Those two words sent shivers down my spine, my body ran cold and the look in her eye caused shockwaves of devastating emotion to course through my blood.

I got up to close the door, her fear sounded so real, like she saw something I didn’t. I caught a glimpse and wanted to shut the back door, she stared at it for half a minute and was begging me to. Michael must have been close to closing the door, he got killed because he simply wasn’t quick enough, I thought.

As I reached the back door it was late at night, around 10. I grabbed at the handle and yanked as hard as I could. I heard the nails that burrowed into the house grind against the wood, soft crunching as it peeled away the paint and splinters. Moments before the door would have broken free I heard a soft gulping swallow from inside the house.

Turning to look inside I saw a mighty shadow moving through my home, the sound of heavy scrapes along the hardwood. A spirit.

 I rushed inside and yelled out, “Stay the fuck away from her!”

The scrapes stopped. 

“How did you get inside?!” I bellowed as I rounded the final corner to see it.

I saw its back, brown shell, a slit down the middle like a beetle has. Its four legs were long, triple jointed, thin wiry hairs stuck out from them and seemed to move on their own like thousands of tentacles. The legs end in a two toed clawed foot.

As it stood there its back plates shifted and made hefty cracking noises, they were high pitched, like a bat’s echolocation. It was taller than me, its body nearly too wide to fit down the hallway to my bedroom.

“What are you?” I asked, it was the only thing that I could think of.

It slowly shifted in place, each foot step made a soft click on the wood. The cracking coming from its torso became louder and louder, my ears began to ring, I saw the light from my bedroom flicker every time it made one of its cracking noises.

Finally it turned its whole body towards me. Dangling from its torso was a ‘head’, bluish in colour. Calling it a head is just an approximation to what it actually was.

Two empty sockets looked like where eyes would sit, a malformed lump below them mimicked a nose in the vaguest sense of the word and a third, final, drooping hole would be its mouth, unhinged and swaying, slime oozing out of every orifice.

It looked like a skulless face, like someone perfectly peeled the entire skin off a person’s body.

In that moment I could tell it wasn’t meant to be human in appearance, just pareidolia. Just a mask. So I asked it again, “What are you?”

It gurgled and let out a soft humming noise. Slime started to spill forth from its ‘mouth’ and splattered on the floor.

“Are you God?” I asked, trying to be assertive but failing as I looked at this hideous thing.

It made a swallowing noise in return, more bile forming in its ‘eyes’ and ‘mouth.’

“If you are God,” I said, desperate, “then save Sarah!” I dropped to my knees, beneath the spirit. “Please save her! Please…”

It offered no words in response, just its continued gurgle.

“Please…” I begged now, hands clasped together, “Please…”

It shifted in its place and did nothing, it didn’t move towards her, it didn’t offer even an attempt at communication. This defiance to me, this lack of acknowledgment didn’t just scare me, it made me furious. I was so angry, I was screaming at it, begging desperately to give me anything and it stared at me with its slackjaw and vomited.

“Fuck you,” I said, voice trembling, “fuck you, for taking Michael, fuck you for scaring Sarah. You’re not a God, you’re not even an angel, you’re fake! A fucking fairytale!”

I didn’t know what I was saying, I was scared and upset. I wanted it to help me, I wanted it to prove itself to me. 

As I screamed, it made a loud whistle, so loud I had to clasp my hands over my ears. Slowly three phallic tendrils emerged from its orifices, one for each hole. They searched the air like a curious snake reaching for the sky, they grew out and forced more chunky slime up with them. They were pinkish and as they bent and searched around I saw they had small pin holes at the end. Randomly along the cylindrical tendrils were bumps, they acted as joints, allowing them to rotate like a finger. Slowly these bile dripped things began to make their way towards me.

“I’m sorry.” I said, desperately trying to pull myself to my feet, “Please, I’m so sorry.”

They began to thrash around violently and move towards me quicker, growing in length and the whistle shot out again, causing me to yelp in pain, “PLEASE FORGIVE ME, I’M SORRY, I’M SO SORRY!”

I clenched my eyes shut and braced as the tendrils came inches from reaching my body. Then silence, the gurgling stopped, the sound of dripping bile gone and no whistles broke through.

“Jacob?” A soft voice beckoned from the end of the hallway, opening my eyes, it was Sarah. She had managed to drag herself to her feet to come rescue me. The auditor was nowhere to be seen, though its slimy evidence remained.

I bolted to her and hugged her tightly, she ran a soothing hand through my hair, ‘It’s okay, it’s okay, shh.”

That night I was too afraid to dare close the door again, I finally understood something else about it. Seeing it briefly made you naturally want to escape from it, its horrifying features and alien form but, staring at it for long enough turns that fear into a desperate desire to never upset it. Michael must have caught a glimpse, longer than my observation of the photo but just as long as Sarah’s time looking at it. They both had a natural fear of letting it in. 

The following morning I made Sarah look at the picture for just a couple more minutes and she finally agreed, that the door must remain open.

I shudder thinking about how long her parents must have stared at one to break their own doors down.

Now this might sound unbelievable, Hancock thinks it is. 

I had grown up with such a constant fear and respect of these elves, that when I finally saw one, its heinous form writhing in my kitchen. Its spittle on my floor. I truly believed that it was normal.

Not common, but normal. 

No one would say a bear mauling a man or a snake biting someone is abnormal, they’re real animals, with real desires and real fears, it’s normal for them to act in a savage way on occasion. To me, these elves were like those animals. A being potentially more powerful than man, with desires beyond our comprehension and fears that rival our fear of them. That to me sounds like I’ve described a bear. 

A bear’s desires are beyond what we could ever hope to understand, it hunts for food and seeks shelter in the winter but what that seeking feels like, the relief they get when they have just enough food, we will never understand. 

Ultimately this is why I found the spirits normal. I just thought all over the world people deal with the spirits constantly. I assumed there were thousands, millions of attacks by these things.

Not every bear attack makes international news.

I am stalling myself, I don’t want to type what happened next. Sarah died. She didn’t get saved by the spirits, she didn’t get killed by them either, the cancer killed her. One morning I woke up and she had left us. She wasn’t more sick the night prior and we didn’t have a strange occurrence the day before, cancer, simple as that. 

I was 23, an adult but I felt like a child. I watched someone I loved so dearly get lowered into a hole, her wooden box decorated just to be covered in muck. Her mother didn’t cry, she looked miserable but never shed a tear. I wailed whenever I was alone, I sobbed and screamed and broke things. I wasn’t even sad, I was angry.

I was angry at cancer, at her mother but mostly at the spirits. The useless fucking scarabs that waddle from house to house, making babies and throwing tantrums. Sarah and her family treated them like royalty and they did nothing to prevent her fate, they did NOTHING.

The sadness hit a month later, I was cleaning her things, deciding what to keep and what I needed to send back and I saw a small notebook. A journal from her youth, placed purposely under a pile of clothes she had folded during her time in bed. 

I sat on the floor cross legged like a young boy and opened this small book covered in flowers, the pink had faded to a white and the pages were torn with love and use.

I flicked through page after page, drawings, descriptions of friends, her best days and her worst.

Then I reached the page she bookmarked, she had physically taped the bookmark in, so I wouldn’t miss it. It would have been when she was 14, it read, “I think I love Jacob.” 

She used that journal to the brim, she documented nearly every waking moment of its paper backed life. The journal was full of stories and dreams and hopes.

She wanted to be an astronaut, a zoo keeper and the first person to discover bigfoot. She was always so wonderful. I miss her. This hurts so bad.

It feels distasteful, listing the abstract and the weird but her journal was full of it too. She documented hearing things enter her room, the spirits. She wrote about times they would create spirals out of the lamb meat on the plate and she would accuse her mother because it freaked her out so much to see.

At 15, she wrote about a time her mother’s blindfold slipped, “She was so scared. She didn’t talk all day, even when I asked what was wrong, just smiled. Mum, please be okay.”

Dad came over the day I discovered her diary, found me curled around the journal sobbing with it pressed against my chest. He sat on the edge of my bed and waited, didn’t interrupt or offer words of guidance. He knew how much I was hurting, how much grief was peeling at my skin and festering in my flesh. Once I finally had a moment of lucidity I looked at him and asked, “How’d you get in? Did I leave the back door open?” Followed by my most pathetic laugh I could manage.

He grinned softly, kindly and said, “I knocked but I heard you crying and came to check if you were safe,” I went to respond and he just continued, “leave Plucketville, don’t let it take anymore kid.”

That day Dad and I spent together, looking at the best unis, taking breaks so I could cry. 

We settled on my current one and I applied. The remainder of the year was dedicated to saving money and convincing Mum it was a good idea that I leave. She did eventually agree after months of screaming matches but left me with some ominous advice, “You will hate it, leaving will crush you but, sometimes it's best to look out for yourself.”

Then that leads to the day before I left. Mum was upset, Dad was hopeful and Tyler was saddened but made me promise to call him every day. I spent my final night in Plucketville curled up on the couch, listening to my Dad snore and having Tyler screaming at his Fortnite lobby at 3am. I stared at the ceiling, watched the fan blades whoosh around, thinking about how I’m the first person I know who ever left Plucketville.

I felt like I was discovering something amazing, the moon, a new animal or bigfoot. I hoped Sarah was proud of me.

Then I left.
