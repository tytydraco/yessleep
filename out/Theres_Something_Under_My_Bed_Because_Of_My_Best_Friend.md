We all remember those chain mail messages that floated around mid 200s right? The "Send this two six friends or this girl will rip your face off" type crap. Well those still do exist, you'll find them usually on Instagram on those stupid accounts with the freaky spiders or some crap. Early 2020, my friend sent me one of those chain mail messages, but it wasn't the run of the mill message. This message ruined my whole upbringing.

For context, I was 16 when this happened, fresh into high school. My friend who we'll call Mikey, was my best friend all through my life from backyard to elementary school and on. During high school Mikey had a bit of a personality change, yours would too if your dad was a belligerent alcholohic and your mom beat you. Mikey would be labeled a "Columbine sympathizer" if you catch my drift, this was because of his change from bright and positive clothing to all black, eye liner, typical emo phase stuff. He also seemed to hate everybody as he'd talk crap about everyone behind their back, but I always tried sticking up for him.

Mikey then started acting weird after one day, even with his fashion change and temperament change he still talked to me like normal every day and sat with me every day. He still did that, but he was glued to his phone. In just a week Mikey had his phone taken away at least six times for using it and every time I looked at his phone he was on some weird chain mail message site. It seemed to have different chain mail messages you could send, but all of them looked like I was reading the Book of the Dead with the pictures it had. He'd been messaging them to our friends or at least I thought he had since I heard them mention it. Then one day something happened to them.

I didn't see most of our friends one week besides Janet, and she was an absolute mess. She came into school with hair visibly ripped out of her skull, deep scratches all over her hands and most likely her arms, and her eyes were majorly bloodshot. I tried asking her what happened but she just avoided me saying, "I don't want to talk about it." Then the next following days she disappeared. That night it happened, I knew I should've just gone to sleep instead of picking up my fucking phone.

It was about 12:30 in the morning and I was having trouble getting to sleep, I'd been binging Ryan Gosling movies all night which was what was probably keeping me up. I decided just to throw on some music and laid down to close my eyes and try to go to sleep. Then just as I was about to drift to sleep, my phone went off. Going against my brain screaming to go the hell to sleep I grabbed my phone and saw a Messenger text from Mikey. "Nora, take a look at this." Followed by the text "Send this to five friends" that made me scoff. I humored Mikey and tapped on the message to see the full text, and that's when it clicked that I shouldn't turned my phone off an hour ago.

The text was followed by an image, an image of a bed with pitch black appendages bit long claws were wrapped around the bed. But what terrified me was the foot of the bed as peeking out from the board was a face with a teeth filled smile that was instead bright white with sharp fangs and bright red eyes. I shook off the feeling and deleted the message from the conversation, "Go to bed Mikey, we've got school early tomorrow. I'll see you there." I told him before turning off my phone. The following days were pretty normal, Mikey acted normal, strangely normal. But then he disappeared, and something else appeared.

I was laying in bed that night, reading my comic books and listening to music to help me fall asleep. I finished the book and slid it away in my nightstand before getting under my covers as my eyes slowly started to close. My eyes were closed for a good 15 minutes when I felt like I was being watched, causing my eyes to open. Nothing was there, when suddenly I started seeing two large arms creep up out from under my bed. I quickly moved my legs up against my chest as the arms then clasped the bed and held down on it tight as I heard a clicking sound that pierced my ears. But my eyes were the ones to feel like needles stabbing into them, as I saw the head of the thing slither out from under my bed.

Its head slowly writhed upwards as a disgusting and horrifying smile inched itself up for me to see the extended canines that had to be at least five inches, with the rest of the teeth being sharp enough to bite through someone's skull. But the eyes, they were like looking into a black hole with a red sun in the middle of it, it was almost hypnotizing. But what was hypnotizing but also beyond fear inducing, was it's voice.

"It's time Nora." It spoke. It's voice was soft but had a bass accompanying it, it hit all of my sensory receptors and both enticed me but also disturbed me. "It's time to come in Nora." It said as it's claws rhythmically tapped my bed as if it was patiently waiting for me. I could see it's bright red tongue swiping across the inside of it's teeth like a prisoner's cup against the bars of the cell. "Join your friends Nora, be with them." The creature giggled with a heart stopping noise resembling a box of tacks being shaken. All I would do is just stare at it, as I felt that if I moved my eyes away the thing would scarf me me down like a pound of beef. When the clock hit 6:00PM the monster would just say, "We'll meet again Nora, and you will join your friends."

This "routine" went on until I was 18. To avoid sleep deprivation, I'd sleep during the day where my parents thankfully let me sleep for six hours. Once I graduated high school I hugged my mom and dad goodbye and moved out where I found a place two states away. Thankfully I didn't have to make anymore changes to my lifestyle, besides sleeping with my bedroom lights on. But every night, I still hear that creature's voice in my head, I still swear I see him gripping onto my bed with that disgusting and unholy face staring at me. I still hear him tell me, "It's time Nora. It's time to join your friends. It's time to come in Nora."
