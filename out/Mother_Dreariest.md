Dear jurors of my imagined court, please pay close attention to the following: My mother is (was) a vile and repugnant devil that deserved no less than death.

When an evil soul finds its accursed way into an infantile vessel and fills it with sin, we drift further away from the paradise we should’ve nurtured. Humanity was given a blank canvas and painted it with shit, a smeared portrait of misery. My mother had a filthy brush in hand all her life and never once hesitated to fill in a gap at the edge of the picture, her technique was strong and brutal, and anyone who had the misfortune to meet her was marred by her very character. 

My father, for example, was probably her second biggest victim (no prizes for guessing number one) and never even knew it. He was dead before she revealed her talons to him which must’ve been galling for a devil like her. My mother, my dearest and deadest, would befriend an innocent soul, someone who’s body was invaded by trumpeting angels shortly before their sinewy cord was cut, win their trust over the course of many years, before turning to a devil right in front of their eyes.  

My darling father was only forty-three when he died from a brain haemorrhage, sometimes I think he must’ve crammed the evil he shared his bed with into a small compartment in his head until one day it burst at the seams, sending shockwaves of horror through each and every synapse until his brain stem caught wind of the chaos and decided to go kaput.  

She is (was) a master of disguise, she possessed a level of mastery that could only have been taught by Lucifer himself. It was so effective that it tricked the congregation of St John’s Parish church in Harlington, the village in which she raised (dragged) me. Each and every Sunday she’d sit in the pews and sing hymns and only I could see the glint of evil in her otherwise maroon eyes, whilst others stole glances at her pretty spinster face and wished their wives were so holy, and so attractive. It makes me sick that she crossed that church threshold without an iota of worry she may burst into flames, whether that makes her brave or plain stupid, I leave up to you my jury, judge and executioners.  

I don’t remember the precise moment I understood what lurked within her, I may have always known, a priori knowledge bestowed upon me from God. When I reached pubescence and father was dead, I dove into my religious studies and never looked back. As I became more enlightened, my mother’s true form became clearer, it was like I’d had a blindfold stapled to my eyes and the holy hand of God painlessly removed it. 

When I was fifteen, I accused her outright of being a servant of Lucifer, wrought upon Harlington to bring about hell on Earth.

She laughed, dear jury, the most maniacal demoniac laugh I shall – hopefully - ever hear. She told me if that were true, I must be Satan spawn. 

This caused a crisis of character that lasted for ten years. Ten long years in which I did all I could to prove myself holy despite the sinful condition of my birth, I joined the priesthood, I did missionary work in Africa, I even gave 90% of my wages from my part-time job at a café to charity (and a further 9% to St John’s Parish Church).

Please understand, dear reader, this was not enough to eradicate the feeling that kept me up at night, in fact it only got worse as I left my teens and entered my twenties. 

If one is to know of a humanoid devil, one has the responsibility to take care of it, one is recruited into the army of God.

When I killed her (it) she was seventy-three and her physical body had deteriorated so much it rendered her an invalid. Her eyes may have looked vacant to a civilian, but to a soldier of God, the devil was wide awake in those vacuous 
jellied spheres.

After a brief stint in a sanatorium (no time to explain this particular evil), I returned to my childhood home in Harlington to cohabit with the creature. The state had provided her with a carer who cooked all her meals, wiped her arse, helped her into bed, and probably facilitated her unholy rites. She couldn’t draw a pentagram on account of her Parkinson’s disease; at least not a good one.

When it came to method, vanquishing her (it) was to be a glorious affair. I researched meticulously the correct way of going about it, I feared that in death I ran the risk of setting her free upon Harlington without the confines of that frail old body.

Is she merely a vessel for a devil or is she a devil incarnate? Should I refrain from damaging her tangible form and only aim for what it contained or should I aim to obliterate her (it) in totality?

These were some of the conundrums I wrestled with for the better part of a year, tossing to-and-fro in my soaking sheets, all too conscious of her presence only walls away. Eventually, I decided to burn her to death. To purge her with flames, and to cast her ashes into the sea.

It also meant I could frame it as an electrical fault.

After I rigged fourteen extension cables (an oddity in my Amazon history) to the mains in an attempt to overload the circuit and flicked on the switch, I ran into the garden. I’d wheeled her (it) only inches from the socket and felt joy and relief as the sparks began to set alight the ends of her floral gown. She was facing me and, for the first time since before her last stroke, began to smile as the flesh of her legs blackened and shrivelled from the bone. The load from my shoulders lifted in conjunction with the life floating away from her (its) body and I screamed to the sky,

“I’m free! I’m free!”

Once it was done and the firefighters had salvaged what they could of my childhood home, I overheard a policeman note on strange burn patterns around the spot she (it) had disintegrated, and like that, I knew I was caught.

Part of me was elated, I’d have the glory of having defeated one of God’s most venomous foes, but I quickly pushed that feeling down as prideful conceit. 

Though perhaps I’d earned that, I’d ask God later from my cell.

All that being said, dear reader, please do not confuse this with a mere confession, I’m boasting.
