I’ve heard many rumors about these kinds of horror experiments—midnight games, summoning rituals, things that supposedly open doors to other worlds. None of them ever felt real. Not like this. It all started with a book. Not some old, dusty tome hidden in a forgotten library, but a modern book on urban legends I picked up from a 
secondhand shop. 

I wasn’t even looking for anything creepy—I just liked collecting weird stories. I skimmed through familiar myths—Bloody Mary, the Midnight Man, the Three Kings Ritual—until I turned to a half-torn page. The Elevator Game. The description was vague, just a few lines of text that barely explained it. A ritual. An elevator. A woman. A world beyond. That was it. No details, no instructions, nothing. Just an eerie warning at the bottom: “Those who have seen the other world never return the same.” I felt something strange then—a pull. The way the words were written, the way the page seemed too worn, as if someone had read it over and over again, as if someone had tried it. I needed to know more. But the book was useless. There were no sources, no citations, just a vague reference to an “online forum dedicated to forbidden games.” 

So I searched. And searched. And searched. But finding real information about the Elevator Game was nearly impossible. Every website I clicked on was filled with the same copy-pasted text, recycled over and over again. Just the same rules, the same warnings, the same vague stories. Nothing real. I wanted something deeper. Something true. That’s when I found it. A hidden thread. Buried in an old horror forum, its last reply dated over a decade ago. The title was simple: “I saw the Other World. Ask me anything.” The username was just a string of numbers, no profile picture, no history of other posts. Most of the replies were trolls or skeptics. People calling it fake, asking stupid questions. But in between all the noise, the original poster had responded. Short, cryptic answers. “It’s not what you think.” “The woman is not what she seems.” “Don’t go if you’re not ready.” And then—one reply stood out. A user had asked, “How do you really play?” The response was different. Detailed. Methodical. Like instructions.

THE ELEVATOR GAME: TRUE RULES
"If you’re reading this, you’re already in too deep."
"This game isn’t just a myth. It’s a door. And once it opens, it doesn’t always close."
Requirements:

* An elevator where you will be completely alone.
How to Start:
1. Step into the elevator. Do not exit until the ritual is complete.
2. Press the floors in this exact order:4 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 10 → 5
3. When you reach the 5th floor, a woman may enter.
Important: DO NOT LOOK AT HER. DO NOT SPEAK TO HER.
1. Press the 1st floor to return.
    * If the elevator descends, the game has failed.
    * If the elevator rises to the 10th floor, you are no longer in your world.
What You Will See:
* The hallways will be empty and dark.

"Some people never make it back."

That last sentence sent a shiver down my spine.
I scrolled down, looking for more replies—but there were none.
Just one final post from the original user.
“If you want proof, play it yourself. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
I hesitated.
It was stupid. Just a game. A stupid internet legend.
But the way they wrote about it—the certainty in their words—made it feel different.
I needed to know.
And I needed to try.
That’s how I ended up standing in front of an abandoned office building at 1:42 AM, staring at a dull silver elevator, feeling a cold sweat creep down my spine.
The doors slid open.
It was time to play.

I told myself it was just a game. That all of this—the book, the forum, the strange rules—was just another horror story buried in the deep corners of the internet. And yet, as I stood in front of the abandoned office building, staring at the elevator doors, something inside me whispered: “Turn around. Leave.” But I didn’t. I stepped forward, the sound of my own footsteps echoing in the empty lobby. The air smelled stale, untouched for years. Dust floated in the dim glow of the flickering overhead lights. I reached out and pressed the elevator button. Nothing happened at first. Then—ding. The doors slid open. I hesitated. A stupid part of me expected something—a sign, a warning, a reason not to go through with this. But there was nothing. Just the cold, metallic interior of an old elevator. I stepped inside. The moment the doors closed behind me, it felt different. The air was heavier. The silence louder. The panel of buttons glowed faintly in the dim light. My fingers hovered over them. I could still turn back. I could press 1, walk out, go home, pretend I never found that book, never read those forum posts, never got curious. But I didn’t. I pressed 4. The elevator lurched to life. I swallowed hard, watching the floor numbers change. Ding. The doors slid open. A hallway stretched out before me, dimly lit, completely empty. The air beyond was thick, stagnant, like no one had breathed it in years. 

I forced myself to stay calm and pressed 2. Another jerk. The elevator moved. Ding. Another empty hallway. 6. Ding. 2 again. Ding. I felt it before I saw it—something shifting in the air, pressing against me, like the elevator itself was becoming smaller, tighter. I ignored it. 10. Ding. The hallway beyond was different. The lights flickered. The walls seemed… wrong, like they were stretching, bending slightly. Like they weren’t supposed to be there. I felt a sharp, electric chill crawl up my spine. One more. 5. I exhaled slowly. This was the one. The doors slid open. And she was there.

Standing perfectly still. At first, I thought she was normal. A woman in her late twenties, maybe early thirties, wearing a pale blue dress. Long, black hair hanging loosely over her shoulders. But then I saw her feet. She wasn’t wearing shoes. Her skin looked wrong. Too smooth, too perfect—like wax. She stepped in without a sound. The air immediately changed. It felt thicker, pressing down on my chest, as if the very space inside the elevator was shrinking. I kept my eyes on the button panel. The rules echoed in my mind. DO NOT LOOK AT HER. DO NOT SPEAK TO HER. She was standing right next to me. I could feel it. Could feel the slight movement of air as she breathed. But it was too slow. Too controlled. Like she was pretending. Her breathing wasn’t natural, like the air was being drawn in with effort—each inhale long and unnatural, as if she was holding her breath just a little too long before exhaling in a way that sounded almost rehearsed. Every breath was deliberate, too rhythmic. She wasn’t alive, not like I was. I could feel the tension in her, the way she stayed motionless, too still. 

Her eyes, they didn’t meet mine. Instead, they seemed to look past me, past everything, locked on some unfathomable point in the distance. But then—her lips curled, barely noticeable at first. It wasn’t a smile. It was more like an involuntary twitch. The corners of her mouth stretched unnaturally, not the way a person smiles, but like she was forcing the movement. I couldn’t tear my eyes away. Her face looked empty, hollow, as if it was just an illusion. She wasn’t a person.

I pressed 1. The elevator obeyed. It began to move. I held my breath, waiting for the number to change. Waiting for the doors to open. Waiting to get out. And then— The elevator stopped. Not on the 1st floor. Not anywhere. The display blinked erratically. The lights above flickered. Then, with a sickening lurch, the elevator moved—up. Ding. 10th floor. The doors slid open. And the world outside was not the same.

The doors slid open. And everything was wrong. I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. The hallway outside stretched into darkness, long and endless, the fluorescent ceiling lights flickering weakly like they were on the verge of dying. The air was thick, like I was standing inside a vacuum, and the silence was so deep that I could hear my own heartbeat. This wasn’t the 10th floor anymore. This wasn’t even the same building. I tried to convince myself that it was just a trick of my mind—bad lighting, faulty power, an old elevator messing up. Then I looked at the floor. There were no floor tiles anymore. Just smooth, dark concrete. Like something unfinished. Like something abandoned. 

I had read the stories. I knew the rules. “Do not leave the elevator.” “Do not explore.” But then— A shadow moved at the far end of the hallway. I saw it just for a second. A shifting, writhing shape, too tall, too thin, slipping into the darkness beyond the dying lights. My fingers tightened into fists. I should have hit the 1st floor button immediately. Should have forced the doors to close. Should have done anything except what I did next. I turned my head. The woman was still there. Standing in the same spot. She hadn’t moved. She hadn’t breathed. But I knew—I could feel it—she was smiling. The kind of smile you don’t need to see to know it’s there. Something in my brain screamed, “Do not look at her!” So I did the only thing I could. I pressed 1 again. Nothing happened. I pressed it harder. Nothing. The button wasn’t responding. Then, in the silence, I heard something. 

Footsteps. Not from the woman beside me. From the hallway outside. Soft. Slow. Careful. Getting closer. I slammed my palm against the button panel. 1. Close. Anything. Get me out of here. The footsteps stopped. The lights flickered. Then, from just beyond the elevator doors, something spoke. Not in words. In laughter. A small, breathy chuckle—childlike, weak, broken. My spine locked. It wasn’t a child. I knew that.

Every instinct in my body knew that. But it wanted me to think it was. The lights overhead flickered again—brighter this time. For less than a second, I saw it. A figure. Standing just beyond the elevator doors, its head tilted, its arms too long, its fingers twisting, curling. And it was watching me. Waiting. My breath caught in my throat. Then— The elevator lurched. The doors slammed shut. And I was falling. Not descending. Falling. The numbers on the panel flashed erratically, skipping floors, counting down too fast, like something was pulling me down through empty space. I clutched the railing, the world around me shaking, distorting, the metal walls groaning like they were about to be crushed inward. 

I had made a mistake. A terrible, irreversible mistake. The woman hadn’t left. She was still there. Standing beside me. Silent. Smiling. And I felt her turn her head toward me. A breath—cold, wrong, too close. And then she whispered, in a voice that was not human— “You shouldn’t have looked.” The elevator slammed to a stop. The lights exploded into darkness. And the last thing I heard—before the doors opened again— Was laughter. Not hers. Something else. Something waiting. Something hungry. The doors slid open. I didn’t move. I couldn’t. The darkness outside wasn’t normal. 

It wasn’t the kind that comes with the absence of light. It was thick, heavy, wrong—a living, breathing thing that stretched out endlessly beyond the elevator. Something was out there. And it was waiting. The air was different now. Stale, damp, filled with something sour—like rotting wood soaked in old water. I gripped the railing, my knuckles white. I needed to think. I needed to get out of here. The rules. I had to remember the rules. “To return, you must use the same elevator and repeat the sequence in reverse.” I could do that. I just had to— The woman moved. Just a shift. A small, slow tilt of her head. My breath caught in my throat. She had never moved before. Not since she stepped in. I squeezed my eyes shut, my heartbeat pounding against my skull. She was looking at me. I couldn’t see her face, but I knew she was looking at me. I pressed 10 on the panel. Nothing happened. 

I pressed it again. Harder. Still nothing. Then— Click. Not the button. Something behind me. Something outside the elevator. I didn’t turn my head. Didn’t even breathe. The sound had been close. Too close. Like fingers tapping against glass. But there was no glass. Only the darkness beyond the doors. And then I heard it. A voice. Soft. Faint. Right outside. “Come out.” I bit my tongue so hard I tasted blood. I pressed the buttons in reverse—5 → 10 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 4. Nothing. The elevator didn’t move. The doors didn’t close. The only sound was my own breathing. And then, something stepped forward. Not a footstep. Something dragging. Sliding. I clenched my jaw, fighting the instinct to look. Looking was breaking the rule. Looking was death. I gripped the railing tighter, whispering under my breath. “Close. Close. Close.” A second passed. Then another. Then— A hand wrapped around the edge of the elevator doors. 

I saw it from the corner of my eye. Thin. Too thin. Fingers long, almost delicate—but stretched, distorted, unnatural. A flicker of movement. It was pulling itself inside. And then— The woman beside me turned. A sharp, unnatural twist—her neck cracking, her body shifting too fast, too smooth, like something made of wax. My stomach dropped. The game had changed. She was never supposed to move. I could feel her now, her presence burning through my skin, pressing against my mind like static, like something crawling through my veins. She leaned closer, her breath cold against my ear. And in a voice that was not hers, she whispered— “You shouldn’t be here.” The doors slammed shut. The elevator jerked violently. And then—I was falling again.

Not moving. Not descending. Falling. The walls warped, stretched, the buttons on the panel flickering, shifting, changing into symbols I didn’t recognize. And somewhere in the darkness, I heard it. Laughter. Not hers. Not mine. Something else. Something that had been watching since the beginning. And it was finally coming closer. 

I was falling. Not down. Not up. Just—falling. The numbers on the panel were gone. The buttons were gone. Even the walls weren’t walls anymore. They were stretching, twisting, breathing. I wasn’t in the elevator anymore. I was somewhere else. Then— Impact. The world slammed back into existence. I hit the ground hard, the breath knocked out of my lungs. My hands scraped against something rough—concrete, cold and uneven. I gasped for air, coughing. 

The air was heavy—damp, thick with something sour, like rusted metal and stagnant water. I blinked. And then I saw where I was. The 10th floor. But not the one I had left. This one was wrong. The hallway stretched on endlessly, longer than it should have been, the walls lined with flickering fluorescent lights that buzzed like dying insects. The floor was cracked, stained with something dark and dry. The doors—every single one of them—were open. I swallowed. In every story, the Other World was supposed to be empty. But I wasn’t alone. There were shadows at the far end of the hallway. Not people. Not human. Tall, bent figures, half-hidden in the flickering light. They weren’t moving. But they were facing me. Watching. I forced myself to stand, my legs shaking. My heart pounded so hard it hurt. I needed to get back to the elevator. I turned— The elevator doors were still open. Relief surged through me. 

I took a step forward— And then I saw it. A red cross. At the end of the hallway, glowing faintly in the distance. The stories were right. That was the sign. If you saw the red cross, it meant you were really here. It meant the Other World was real. And it meant— You weren’t supposed to leave. I felt something shift behind me. A sound. A slow, dragging scrape. One of the doors had just closed. I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. I walked toward the elevator. One step. Then another. The hallway felt longer now. Stretched. Like I wasn’t moving at all. Then—another door closed. Then another. Then another. One by one, all the doors in the hallway were shutting. Slowly. Deliberately. And I realized— The shadows were getting closer. I broke into a run. The elevator was still open. If I could just reach it, if I could just press the buttons in reverse— Then— A voice. From inside one of the rooms. Soft. Gentle. Familiar. “Where are you going?” I froze. Because I knew that voice. It was my mother’s. But that was impossible. 

My mother was at home. She wasn’t here. This place was empty. I turned my head—just a little. Just enough to see the open door beside me. The room inside was dark. But I could see a figure. Sitting on the floor. Head tilted. Smiling. I couldn’t see her face, but I knew she was smiling. The lights above me flickered violently. And then—more voices. From the other rooms. Soft, familiar voices. My friends. My father. People I knew. “Come inside.” “Why are you running?” “We’ve been waiting for you.” My chest locked. They were lying. They weren’t real. They couldn’t be real. SLAM. All the doors snapped shut at once. I ran. The elevator was only a few feet away now. I could feel something behind me, moving fast, crawling, twisting. I didn’t look. I couldn’t. I lunged into the elevator— And slammed the CLOSE DOOR button. The last thing I saw, just before the doors shut, was a hand reaching toward me. Long fingers. Too many joints. And at the last second— It waved. The doors slammed shut. 

I was in the elevator again. The buttons had changed back. I pressed them in reverse. 4 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 10 → 5. The elevator shook violently. The walls groaned, the lights flickered. Then— Silence. And finally— Ding. The doors slid open. And I was back. The real 1st floor. The lobby was empty. The air was normal. The lights weren’t flickering anymore. I stepped out on shaking legs, my breath shallow. I turned. The elevator doors were still open. And inside— It was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything inside anymore. Just darkness. And then— The button for the 10th floor lit up. On its own. The doors slid shut. The elevator began to rise. I watched as the numbers blinked one by one. 2. 3. 4. 5. It didn’t stop. 6. 7. 8. 9. I backed away. 10. The floor number flickered once. And then the screen went blank. The elevator never came back down. And I never saw it again.

I don’t know how long I was trapped in that world. Time didn’t exist anymore. The hallway stretched endlessly, and each step I took felt like an eternity. The air was thick, suffocating, with the taste of iron on my tongue and the stench of decay hanging in the damp, unnatural silence. The walls seemed to pulse, like they were alive, breathing in time with my frantic heartbeat. Every flicker of light overhead cast distorted shadows that twisted and reached out, almost as if the very darkness was trying to drag me back into it. The noises around me were distorted, unrecognizable, like whispers from another dimension. I could feel eyes on me from the corners of the hallway—something was always watching, always waiting for the right moment to strike.

I stumbled toward the elevator, my legs heavy, my chest tight with the weight of fear that clawed at my mind, threatening to swallow me whole. The voices of my loved ones echoed in the rooms beside me—familiar, comforting, but I knew they were false. Their words didn’t belong here. They were just another trap, another part of the game.

With every door that slammed shut behind me, the shadows crept closer, drawing nearer, like they were closing in on their prey. I had to keep moving. I had to make it to the elevator before it was too late. The closer I got, the more I could feel something pulling me toward the abyss—something ancient, something hungry. But I couldn’t stop. I didn’t have a choice.

When I finally lunged into the elevator and slammed the close button, I knew it wasn’t over. The darkness inside the elevator swallowed me whole, but I wasn’t alone. Something was with me. Something that had been waiting for this moment. I pressed the buttons in reverse, feeling the walls groan and shift with every movement. The elevator jerked, the lights flickered violently, and for a brief second, I thought I would be dragged back into the Other World. But then—silence. A horrible, suffocating silence. And then, the familiar ding of the 1st floor. The doors slid open.

I stepped out, trembling, my heart still racing in my chest. I was back. The real world. The lobby was empty, the air normal. But I could still feel it—feel the presence of that world, the dark, twisted place that had almost consumed me. I thought I had survived, but the eerie sensation never left. The elevator was gone. I never saw it again. But I knew it wasn’t over. Something inside me knew that I hadn’t escaped. I had only delayed the inevitable.
