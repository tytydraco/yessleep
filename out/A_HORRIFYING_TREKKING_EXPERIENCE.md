This happened during a trek through the Appalachian Mountains. Four friends and I decided to embark on a journey to explore the wilds of the wilderness, hoping for an adventurous escape. At around 7:30 AM, we left our campsite, unaware of the nightmare that awaited us.

After an hour or two, we reached the starting point of our hiking trail. Excitement mixed with nervousness as we prepared to begin. However, there was one major problem—luggage. My so-called friends conveniently dumped all their bags on me and scattered in four different directions, laughing and shouting, their voices fading into the dense forest. Overloaded with the weight of our belongings, I trudged on, struggling to keep up.

As time passed, daylight began to wane. The thick woods around me grew darker and eerier. Soon, the once-familiar echoes of my friends’ laughter were replaced by an oppressive silence. I called out, but no one answered. Anxiety clawed at me, and my childhood fear of the dark came rushing back. Desperate for light or guidance, I scanned the surroundings. A faint glow caught my eye—a lantern swaying gently at the entrance of a small, remote cabin barely visible through the trees.

Dragging the heavy luggage behind me, I staggered toward the cabin. My watch read 11:53 PM. Knocking on someone’s door at this hour was unsettling, but I had no choice. Summoning my courage, I rang the doorbell.

An old man opened the door, his eyes dull yet oddly piercing. Noticing my condition, he gestured for me to come in. His voice was gravelly but kind as he handed me a glass of water and a plate of rice. Hunger and exhaustion overpowered me, and I devoured the food without a second thought. Afterward, the man offered me a room to rest and insisted I lock the door behind me. I thanked him and collapsed onto the bed, falling into a deep sleep almost instantly.

I woke up to a strange, metallic sound in the dead of night. My heart raced as I strained to listen. It sounded like… a blade being sharpened. Cold sweat trickled down my back as I tiptoed to the door and opened it just enough to peer outside.

The noise was coming from the basement.

Against my better judgment, I crept toward the basement door, which was slightly ajar. My trembling hand pushed it open further, revealing a horrifying sight. The old man was crouched over a grinding wheel, sharpening a long, gleaming knife. His mutterings sent shivers down my spine. My breath hitched as I realized—the knife wasn’t meant for anything mundane. It was meant for me.

I stumbled back, accidentally knocking over a small table. The clatter drew his attention. His head snapped toward the noise, and I bolted toward the entrance. The door was locked. Frantically, I scanned the room and noticed a small backyard through a side window. But what I saw froze me in place—gravestones, half-buried in the overgrown grass. My knees nearly buckled as the grim realization set in: this was no ordinary house. It was a graveyard for travelers who had likely shared my fate.

The sound of footsteps snapped me back to reality. The old man was searching for me. My hands fumbled for anything I could use as a weapon. In the kitchen, I found a can of pepper spray. Gripping it tightly, I hid behind the door.

As soon as he entered, I sprayed him directly in the face. He screamed, clutching his eyes as the knife fell from his hand. Blindly, he stumbled toward the sink to rinse his face. Seizing the moment, I searched the floor and found the key to the entrance. I unlocked the door and ran as fast as I could.

Through sheer luck, I stumbled upon an encampment where one of my friends was sleeping. I woke him up, hysterically recounting everything. We alerted the others, and by morning, we filed a complaint at the nearest police station.

When we returned to the cabin with the authorities, my heart sank. The cabin was no longer the modest dwelling I remembered. It was a crumbling, abandoned shack, covered in dirt and overgrowth. The room where I had eaten was now barren, save for our luggage. The old man was nowhere to be found.

The final twist chilled me to the core. On the wall, hanging from a broken nail, was a faded portrait of the old man. The date etched below the frame revealed he had died over a decade ago.

For weeks after, I couldn’t sleep. To this day, I avoid trekking, for fear of what lurks in the shadows of the Appalachian Mountains.
