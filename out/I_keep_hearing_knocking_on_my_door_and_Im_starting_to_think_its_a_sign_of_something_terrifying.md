KNOCK. 

That’s how it begins. A single knock. 

It isn’t frightening. Not at first. It seems perfectly run-of-the-mill, closer to annoying than terrifying. 

Knock. Knock.

“Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.” I cross the apartment and look through the sightglass, but there’s nobody there. I twist the doorknob, glance up and down a vacant hallway. There's nothing. No one. It’s just peeling wallpaper and stained carpet as far as the eye can see. 

“Huh,” I mutter, scratching my head. “Could’ve sworn....”

Back inside. I fall onto the couch, cozy up with a blanket and unmute the TV. There’s a news program on. Something local. It’s about a boy that fell into a well, some kid named Timothy, who survived thanks to the efforts of a barking dog and some passing hikers. The reporter is calling it a miracle. She’s calling it a Hollywood movie come to life. 

Knock. Knock. 

“Hello?” 

I sit up. Wait for a response. 

“Who's there?” I ask.

Knock.

My feet slap against the hardwood. I’m jogging across the apartment, flinging the door open to catch the prankster in the act, but there’s no prankster. There’s no act. There’s nothing but the smell of TV dinners creeping out from behind closed apartment doors. 

I frown. Think it over. Maybe this is me hearing things, maybe this is a lack of sleep finally catching up to me.  “Yeah,” I mumble, stifling a yawn. “That’s probably it.”

I head back inside, curl up on the couch. I’ve been having nightmares since moving in, nightmares that my therapist calls a side-effect of a new environment. She says they’re part of an adjustment period. They’ll pass, but only if I can maintain a positive outlook. 

So I turn up the volume. The feel-good news story fills my apartment, fills my ears. Right now, the reporter  is describing the boy’s rescue, explaining that the hikers were drawn to the well by the barking dog, but that when they arrived the dog bolted into the trees. Now she’s interviewing the boy.

“I would’ve liked to meet him,” Timothy is saying, shivering in a Channel 7 blanket. “The d-dog I mean. I wish he didn’t run off because now I can’t say t-thank you for helping me.”

The reporter pays the camera a knowing wink. “Well, just hold tight, Timothy. We’ve got a team searching the woods right now, and once we find that pup, we’ll be sure to introduce you two.”

The boy’s eyes light up. “Really?” 

“You betcha–”

Knock. Knock. Knock. 

“Oh, fuck off!”

I don’t even realize it but I’m clenching my fists. I’m standing in my living room, dressed in my bathrobe and underwear, and I’m clenching my fists and I’m shaking. This isn’t like me. It hasn’t been like me for a long time. 

Deep breath, Quinn.  

Relax. 

I close my eyes, go through my mental checklist. It’s six items long. It helps me to focus, to ground myself in the present and escape my frustrations. The next time I speak, my voice is measured. Controlled. 

“Look,” I say, “I don’t know who you are but I’d appreciate it if you left me alone. I’ve had a long week, and I’d rather not deal with this right now. Got it?”

I say the words to my apartment door. It doesn’t respond. 

Whatever. Back to the couch. Back to the drip-feed of positivity about the dog and the hikers and the boy who lived. The reporter's standing next to an older man now. His eyes are hollow, his cheekbones sunken and there’s a patch of hair missing from the front of his scalp. 

“I’m here with Timothy’s father,” the reporter says. “What do you think about your son’s rescue, Mr. Koates?”

The man grunts. His eyes swivel left and right, his tongue lashing out across lips chapped and trembling. “Tough to believe,” he mutters. “Tough to believe anybody could survive that, but then Timothy’s always had a blessed life. An easy life. He hasn’t dealt with the sort of horror that–”

Knock.

Somebody’s out there. They’re messing with me, screwing with me and turning me into their own little joke. It isn’t nice of them. They have no idea what I’ve been through, no idea at all. I gnaw my lip. It’s a nervous habit I picked up in childhood, one that the doctors could never quite beat out of me.


Knock. Knock. 

I can’t stop myself. My feet start moving on their own. I’m taking a step toward the door, then I’m taking another. I’m walking slowly enough, softly enough that my feet don’t make a sound as they cross the floorboards. The doorknob’s cold to the touch. So is the deadbolt. My hands wrap around both and I wait like that for my moment to strike. This time I’m going to catch them. 

This time I’m going to make them wish they’d left me alone. 

Knock.

I throw the lock. Twist the knob. In the space of a second I’m standing in the hallway, hunched over like an animal searching for its prey. My teeth are bared. My hands are pumping in and out of fists. I’m spinning around like a hurricane, back and forth, forth and back, and my heart is slamming out of my chest. 

“WHERE ARE YOU?” I holler. 

Nothing answers. There isn’t so much as a curious shuffle of movement in the surrounding suites. It’s just empty, awful silence. I’m shouting into what feels like a void, some anomalous abyss in the shape of a hallway, and it doesn’t make any sense.

Somebody’s here. They have to be. 

My nose itches. I bring a finger to the tip, and I touch something wet, something warm. My nose is bleeding. I wonder if it’s from the stress, or the dry air, or if it’s another relic from my childhood, a side-effect of their endless experiments and the–

“Everything okay?”

I wheel around. There’s a man in the hall. He’s dressed in sweatpants and he’s blinking at me like he just woke up. 

“I heard shouting,” he mumbles. Then he squints, rubs his jaw in dawning realization. “Hang on… I know you, don’t I? You’re next door. Apartment 408, right?”

I swallow. Interacting with others has never been my strong suit. “Yeah,” I say, pulling my mouth into a smile. “Sorry… Sorry about the noise, I’ve just been getting harassed by somebody knocking on my door and…uh…they keep running off and… ” I chuckle, unsure how to end the conversation.

The guy lifts an eyebrow. Frowns. “Right. Well, I can’t say I’ve heard anybody knocking on your door, and I haven’t heard anybody running around for that matter either.” He looks back to me, and this time he’s eying my bathrobe and my underwear, my bloody nose and the bags under my eyes and he says, “You on drugs, buddy?” 

A muscle twitches near my eye. “No. Why would I–”

“You look like you’re on drugs.”

“I’m not on drugs,” I say, incredulous. 

“Whatever, just keep it down. I’ve got a shift in a few hours and I’m trying to sleep.” He shoots me a glare, shakes his head. “Not that you’d know what work is.”

“Hey–”

He slams the door in my face. Something boils inside of me. My knuckles crack as my hands become fists, and all at once I want nothing more than to break down that door, want nothing more than to tear it off its hinges and–

Knock. 

My heart hits my ribs.

Knock. Knock. 

I grind my teeth. 

There it is again. That damn knocking! I wonder if it’s the neighbor, if he’s knocking on the other side of his door, or the wall, just to mess with me and make me– hold on. I swivel my gaze. The fire escape. 

That’s it. 

That’s their base of operations. I charge down the hall, shoulder-check the fire escape door and barrel down the steps. One floor. Two. I keep running in mad circles until I’m at the bottom and my head is spinning and I’m twisting and turning and finally I find–

Nothing. 

There’s nothing down there but dusty concrete. No suspects. No culprits. Just a fluttering moth, one trying to end its life against a flickering bulb. 

Christ, I think, falling onto the steps. Maybe he’s right. 

My neighbor, I mean. 

Maybe he’s right and there really isn’t anybody, and there never was. Maybe all along I’ve just been hearing the echoes of my own neurosis. The symphony of a broken mind. My teeth clamp my lip. The thought is making me tense, it’s making me shake with self-loathing and it’s the sort of thing my therapist would call a triggerpoint. Something I can latch onto. Something I can spiral with. 

I sprint back upstairs, lock my door. I go to the bathroom and run the water until it's colder than ice, then I splash it across my face. I’ve gotta shock my system. Wake myself up. I’ve gotta shake this mood before it sinks its teeth in. I start by cleaning the blood from my nose, and it’s a mistake because it means looking at my own reflection. 

There’s a man in the mirror. He’s a stranger that I hardly know, and I hate everything about him. His face is a valley of lines. He’s twenty-two going on ninety, and for somebody like him, everyday feels harder than the last. His skin is cracked, practically leather, and his eyes are…

No. 

I bring a cloth to my cheek. 

When did that start?

Bleeding. My eyes are bleeding. 

This isn’t right, this shouldn’t be happening. The medication was supposed to prevent this, it was supposed to make me feel better, to keep the side-effects at bay, but now here I am bleeding from my eyes and my nose. Here I am hearing things that don’t exist. 

Why?

Why?

It’s a question I’ve asked my entire life, and never once have I gotten an answer worth hearing. Only lies. Excuses. My bathroom mirror cracks, a fissure running through the glass. It’s funny, isn’t it? People tell you that monsters are make-belief– that boogeymen don’t exist, but they’re wrong. The real myth of our world is honesty. It’s truth. 

The lights of the bathroom begin to snap and pop. There’s a sizzle of electricity, of wires short-circuiting and that’s when I know I’ve gone too far, that I’ve begun indulging the wrong thoughts. Positivity. That’s what I need. Something to pull me out of this funk before things get worse. 

So it’s back to the couch. It’s back to the television and the feel-good news story about the boy and the dog and the hikers and the murderous well. I take a shuddering breath. The newscaster is right where I left her, standing beside the well, but she’s lost her smile. 

Where did her smile go?

“To the viewers at home, I don’t know what to say…” she stammers, and her voice is quaking with the magnitude of an earthquake. Her eyes are red. Mascara is running down her cheeks. 

Something is wrong. 

She brings a hand to her face, wipes a streak of make-up with the back of her sleeve. “We… Oh god, we had no idea that would happen. Jesus! I swear to you that–”

The television flickers. 

There’s a kaleidoscope of colors, of grating static, and when the image returns I see the newscaster standing silent. Her eyes are closed. Her finger is pressed to the side of her head, to the earpiece, and she’s nodding along. Listening. The next time she speaks, it’s with the calculated coldness of a producer sitting in a boardroom a thousand miles away. 

“We here at Channel 7 reject any and all allegations of wrongdoing,” she says, forcing the words out through a choking sob. “The meet and greet between Timothy and the rescue dog was meant to showcase the potential of love, and hope, and…” Her voice breaks. “And we had no idea the dog was infected with rabies. None. Timothy’s death is a tragedy, but–”

A vein throbs near my temple. 

This is it. This is me feeding the negativity. The screen flickers as I move through channel after channel, desperate to find something something more uplifting, something that’s a better influence on my mood, but it’s all war and genocide and hatred and death and–

Knock. 

You son of a–

No.

Relax, Quinn. There’s nobody there. It’s all in my head. I tell myself to ignore the knocking, to let it go because if I don’t then bad things will happen. They’ve happened before. 

Drip.

Drip.

Something’s dripping onto my lap. 

It’s falling from my beard. I bring my hand to my face, and I feel fresh blood leaking from my nose, from my eyes. How? This isn’t happening to me. It can’t be because–

KREEEE

I hear the screech of a car losing control, the metallic crunch of a vehicle crumpling against solid concrete. It’s coming from outside. Just beneath my apartment. 

Screams.

The night is full of screams. 

Knock. 

My chest pounds. I pick up my phone, frantic, scroll through all four of my contacts and find my therapist. She’s the closest thing I have to a friend. I’ve known her my entire life, and if anybody can help me right now, it’s her. I hit dial. It rings. It rings some more, and keeps ringing, and the entire time I’m biting my nails and– 

BEEEEEP

“Hello,”

“Dr. Wilkins! I need to–”

“You’ve reached Dr. Theodora Wilkins at Lockheed’s Advanced Development Division. I’m not in right now. My office hours are–”

I hurl my phone, hurl it hard enough that it dents the wall. I’m shaking with rage, with anger that I can’t seem to bury no matter how hard I try. 

Voices. 

There are voices in the street below, panicked and frightened, and they’re clawing their way through the glass of my window.  

“... is it bad–”

“...he’s decapitated–”

Knock. 

“... the woman can still make it–”

“... she’s lost too much blood–”

Knock.

“... where’s her arm–”

Knock.

“... has anybody seen her arm–”

My television fuzzes. The screen begins to splinter, begins to crack along the center as the image dies. The lamp’s next. My apartment plunges into darkness. It’s just me, me and the bad thoughts and the pain and–

“... needs an ambulance–”

“... my phone’s dead–”

“... somebody call an ambulance!”

Ambulance. 

I can still help. I can still fix things. I stagger to my feet, stumble across my living room and find my phone laying on the floor. There’s a face on the display. A woman. 

“Hello?” the speaker is saying. “Quinn? Are you there?”

I scramble, bringing the phone to my ear. “Dr. Wilkins?”

“Yes, it’s me, Quinn. I’m sorry I missed your call but–”

“There’s been an accident!” I say, panicked. ”Outside my apartment. I think a car crashed and they need an ambulance or–”

“Shh,” she soothes. “I’m contacting emergency services right now. They’ll arrive shortly. It’s okay. You’re okay.”

Breathing. I’m breathing again. “Thank you,” I tell her.

“That’s what I’m here for, remember?”

Her voice is magic. It’s easing my tension, my anxiety. It’s comforting to speak to another human that doesn’t think you’re a drug addict or a psychopath. 

“You sound distressed, Quinn.”

“I am,” I say quickly. “I’ve been hearing things all night long, and now–”

“What kind of things? Voices?”

“No,” I reply. “Not voices. Knocking. I keep hearing somebody knocking on my door, and it’s been going on all night, but every time I check there’s never anybody there, and my neighbor said he doesn’t hear it, but I think that–”

“Slow down, Quinn. You’re spiraling. I can tell. Did you do your breathing exercises, the ones that we practiced?”

“Yes.”

“Your affirmations?”

“I’ve tried everything,” I sputter. “Nothing’s helped. I’m still hearing the knocking, and the nosebleeds have come back, and now my eyes are bleeding too, a-and…” My voice breaks. “I don’t feel like myself, doctor.”

Footsteps. Dr. Wilkin's heels click as she moves across her office and shuts the door. “Have you hurt anybody tonight?” she asks in a whisper. 

“I don’t know,” I mumble. “Maybe… I mean, there was that accident outside that–”

“Accidents happen, Quinn. We’ve been over this. You can’t blame yourself for every bit of doom and gloom in the world.” She takes a breath. “I’m asking if you’ve hurt anybody intentionally.”

“No. God no! I’d never, n-not again–”

“That’s good,” she says. “How’s your sleep? Has it improved since we last spoke?”

“No.”

“You’re still having the nightmares then?”

“...Yes.” 

“I see.” There’s a pause. Dr. Wilkins' next words come slowly, carefully. “What do you think about exploring other forms of treatment, Quinn? Regrouping. Reassessing.”

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean that… Well maybe living on your own might be causing you more stress than you can handle right now.”

“So what?” I say, defensively. “You want me to go back?”

“I want you to be happy, Quinn, and if the lab can help you get there…”

“No. There’s no way,” I say, my teeth clenched.

“Quinn–”

“No!” I snap. “What is it with you and that damn lab? I’ve told you I’m not going back– never going back– and I fucking mean it. Why won’t you listen?”

There’s a moment of dead air, a crackle of static as Dr. Wilkins shifts the phone to her other ear. “I am listening. I know full-well you have no love for that place, but I’ve been watching the news lately, and it’s been making me concerned. There’s a lot of pain out there. A lot of suffering. Much more than usual.”

“Yeah but …” My voice trembles. It’s shaking beneath the weight of a decade of guilt. “I’m trying to do better, I really am, but it’s so…”

“Hard,” she says. “I know that. Okay. If not the lab, then tell me what I can do to help.”

“Can do to help….” I mumble. The question does something to me. It’s spinning up a hurricane inside of my chest, a storm of repressed memories and unanswered questions. “What you can do to help…”

“That’s right,” she says. “Talk to me, Quinn. Communication is key here.”

I shouldn’t ask. 

I shouldn’t. 

It’s the sort of question that never leads anywhere good, the sort that has a body count, but my resolve is crumbling. I’m on the edge like I’ve never been before. I’m grinding my teeth and fuming with rage that–

“Quinn?”

“The experiments…” I mutter, eyes unfocused in the dark of my apartment. “Why did you put me through all those experiments?”

Dr. Wilkins clears her throat. This isn’t what she was expecting when she offered to talk. “Ah,” she says. “I see you’ve been ruminating on the past again. That explains… a lot. That’s not a problem, though. We can work with that.”

“Why did you do it?” I press. “I deserve answers for the things you did to me.”

“Of course you do,” she says with diplomatic concern. “And I agree with you. However, we’ve talked about this, and it isn't productive to discuss that subject as it can make you very upset.”

“Maybe I’m upset because we haven’t discussed the damn subject!” I erupt, slamming my fist on the coffee table. “Maybe I’m upset because I’ve buried a lifetime of trauma instead of confronting it! Did you ever think of that?”

“Your feelings are valid–”

“Then validate them with an explanation!”

Dr. Wilkins gets quiet. I hear a drawer open, the sound of cork popping and the glug glug of liquid being poured into a glass. “Alright,” she says, heaving a sigh. “Why not? Let’s discuss the experiments, if you think that’ll make you feel better. What would you like to know?”

“Let’s start with why,” I say. “Why did you do it? Why put me through all of that suffering?”

“I’ve told you before. We wanted to make a better world.”

“Bullshit!”

Another clink of glass. Another drink. “It’s the truth, Quinn. It is. And we still can– make the world a better place, I mean–  but it requires a shift in your mindset, a harnessing of positive stimuli. Your depression has presented a roadblock, of course. Antidepressants don’t work well with your unique biology but–”

“My unique biology?” I seethe. “You mean how you grew me in a petri dish, how you raised me in and out of test tubes?”

“No. What I mean is–”

“Do you know I still haven’t made a friend? Not one. I’ve got no family. No connections. Thanks to you, I didn’t even see the outside world until–”

“You were nine,” Dr. Wilkins says. There’s a thunk of a glass hitting the table, then more liquor hitting the glass. “I know. I was there. If you want the truth, Quinn, it’s that I regret everything about your upbringing, I do, but you need to understand that we did the best we could with the information we had. Your gift is powerful–”

“Gift?” I say, laughing in disbelief. “You must mean curse. Gifts don’t rip people to pieces and leave you standing in their entrails at nine-years-old.”

There's a half-beat of silence. “Your gifts are difficult to control,” Dr. Wilkins says carefully, “I acknowledge that, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use them to help people. Your gifts could save lives. Billions.”

“You want to know how many lives my ‘gift’ saved today?” 

“Quinn–”

“Do you?”

“I know you're frustrated–”

“Let’s see,” I say, counting off my fingers. “First, I helped a little boy die after giving a dog rabies and making it tear out his throat–”

“This isn’t productive–”

“Next, I made a car lose control and slam into a brick wall. A man's head was sheared off. And a woman's arm–”

“That’s enough!”

“I wonder who my gifts will help tomorrow, doctor? Maybe they’ll–”

KNOCK. 

I grip my hair. Stifle a scream. 

KNOCK. 

Christ!

Why won’t this FUCKING knocking leave me alone?

KNOCK. 

“SHUT UP!” I roar. 

“Quinn!”

“I know!” I gasp. “I know! I’m trying to block it out, I am but–”

“I said that's enough!” Dr. Wilkins snaps. 

My breath catches. Her shift in tone, her sudden temper catches me off-guard. She’s never snapped at me before, not once.

“I’m sorry,” she sputters. “God. That was… It was wrong of me to lose my temper at you. It's just that I need a second to think, okay? I need to get my head in order.”

Another unexpected curveball, but I've waited this long for answers. I can wait another couple minutes if that's what it takes. “Fine,” I tell her. “Whatever you need.”

“Cheers,” she says joylessly.

I hear her pour herself another drink. Then another. She keeps going like that until I hear her throw the bottle, until I hear it shatter it against the office wall. Then she’s mumbling. Talking to herself. Her voice is full of frustration and grief.

“Are you finished–”

“In a minute,” she tells me. 

I give her the space she needs. I sit there, knees pressed to my chest and phone pressed to my ear and I don’t say a word just like I've been taught. Obey. 

Obey. Obey. Obey. It's the most important part about being me, so I listen to her and I wait. I wait and I wait, and I wonder what’s taking her so long. 

Silence. It’s my greatest enemy. What they don’t tell you about ‘peace and quiet' is that it's a breeding ground for repressed memories, and right now, I’m beating my memories back with a stick. Except they won’t stay down. They keep clawing their way back into the spotlight, again and again.

The laboratory. 

The experiments. 

They’re all I can think about. The doctors, and the pills, and the seventy-two syringes they’d plunge into my spine night after night. How many hours did I spend on that operating table? How many years did I spend screaming and crying, begging them to stop?  

How many did I kill to make it happen? 

KNOCK. 

“... our contingency plan?” 

“What?” I say, blinking. “Sorry, I missed what you said.”

“I’m asking if you remember our contingency plan,” Dr. Wilkins says, and her voice is urgent and clipped. “The pill I gave you. The big one with the yellow ribbon around the center. Do you still have it?”

KNOCK. KNOCK. 

My stomach twists. It pulls itself into a knot that’s making me grimace. “Yeah. I do.”

“Thank god,” she says, heaving a sigh. “I need you to take it right now, okay?”

“Now? But why?”

“Like I said, it’ll help with the…” She gives a drunken hiccup. “... Sorry. It’ll help with the nightmares, Quinn. All that knocking is keeping you up, and that’s not good cause you need your sleep and… Well, this will make sure you have a nice long sleep.”

There’s something in her words, some passenger that’s making my skin crawl. It’s a combination of false cheer, fake empathy and… 

“Did you take it yet?” she asks.“You have to hurry and take the pill, Quinn.”

There it is. Unmistakable, naked and obvious. It's fear. Her voice is dripping with fear.

“You’re… lying,” I mutter.

KNOCK. 

“I’m not–”

“There you go again,” I say. “Stop it! Stop lying to me!”

KNOCK.

“Listen to me–”

“All you’ve ever done is lie, and I’m sick of it!”

The pill. 

The fucking pill. 

She gave it to me a lifetime ago. It was right after they pulled me from the wreckage of the lab, right after they shampooed the blood from my hair and promised they wouldn’t hurt me ever again. No more needles. Not now that they knew what I could do to them if they tried. 

Dr. Wilkins was waiting for me then, she was standing in the rubble with her medical-grade smile. “I have something for you, Quinn. It’s a pill and it’s very special. If the bad thoughts ever come back, I need you to take this pill, okay? It’ll make them go away forever. But taking it will hurt a whole bunch, so only take it if you absolutely need to, understand?”

“Okay,” I told her. “I understand.”

And at the time, I thought I did. I thought Dr. Wilkins was looking out for me, that the pill was actually some kind of failsafe that would help ease the pain, but now… Now I’m old enough to connect the dots. I’m old enough to see the pill for what it really is. 

It’s closer to cyanide than advil. 

KNOCK. 

She wants to kill me. 

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

She wants me to kill myself. 

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

There’s a gasp from the other side of the phone. A wheeze. 

“Quinn…” Dr. Wilkins rasps. “You’ve gotta control your thoughts…”

She’s having trouble breathing. It’s a taste of her own medicine, a bit of comeuppance for the suffering she put me through as a child. 

More gasping. More sputtering. She’s having a real hard time of it now, and I think I hear her stumble to the floor, think I hear that clatter of a chair and the desperate clawing of finger-nails against her throat. This is better than she deserves. It’s better than any of them deserve… 

I bite my fist, clench my eyes. 

Damnit. 

This isn’t me. I’m not a bad person, I’m not, and I won’t let them turn me into one either. My mind latches onto a more positive thought, and a moment later I hear Dr. Wilkins breathing again. 

“Thank you…” she sputters. “.. always knew you were a g-good person, Quinn. Always.”

Yes, I think. That’s why you gave me a pill to destroy myself. 

KNOCK. KNOCK. 

“Tell me the truth,” I snarl, my patience exhausted. “All of it. Right now, or I swear I’ll–”

“I will,” she says quickly. “I will, and I won’t lie. Not anymore.”

“I’ll know if you do.”

And just like that, she’s talking. It starts off obvious, starts off with details I could already guess based on what I’d suffered through, but then it gets interesting. My ears prick up. I lean forward, gnawing my lip in anticipation. 

“It was the Cold War,” she tells me, voice slurred from the drink. “That’s when it really began, the idea of you. Back then we were on the brink of – whole world was, I mean– nuclear war. People were afraid. And people do… Well, they do erratic things when they’re afraid, Quinn.”

I shake my head. “What do I have to do with any of that?”

“Everything,” she says. “You… You were conceived as an antidote to humanity's fear. A bulwark against it.”

“You're drunk. This is nonsense.”

“Of course it isn’t,” she says. “Your gifts can extinguish fear, they can unite the world and usher in a paradise. This has always been true.”

“My gifts hurt people.” 

“No,” she groans. “No they –hyuck– don’t, Quinn. Your gifts do whatever you want them to. They always have. They let you reshape reality, alter the very fabric of our existence…” A pause. I hear Dr. Wilkins being sick into her garbage can. 

“Why didn’t you tell me any of that?” I press. “You never described my abilities to me before, never told me what I was doing or how I was doing it. You just kept me in the dark! Do you have any idea how terrifying that was? Having things happen around you, scary things, and being told you're the reason but not why or how?”

“Telling you wasn't possible. Not when you were younger. We needed to make sure you were sound of mind first, that you wouldn't take the knowledge of your abilities and use them to harm others. That takes time. Assessment. It was further impacted by your design, which was –hyuck– sorely imperfect.”

KNOCK. 

Pressure.

There’s pressure in my skull. It’s building between my temples and feels like somebody’s pushing my eyes out of their sockets. It's stress like I've never felt before.

“Imperfect design?” I say, wincing through the pain. “What's that supposed to mean?”

Dr. Wilkins is quiet. “How do I say this? You're much more than a collection of cells cultivated in a petri dish. The experiments… They went well beyond science, Quinn.”


KNOCK. 

My head pounds. There's a ringing in my ears, a guttural shriek like a banshee's dying breath. I’m having trouble focusing, having trouble following the conversation. The words are coming in fragments.

“... digsite in Iraq—”

“... unearthed an artifact—”

“... clay tablet—”

“… Sumerian in origin—”

“... occult runes—”

“... excavation team dead—”

“... primeval religion—”

KNOCK. 

My teeth are rattling. I’m losing time. My whole body is shaking as I stagger to the sink, pour myself a cup of water. It spills across the counter. I pour another. So thirsty. I'm so thirsty. 

“... remarkable properties—”

“... unlike anything we'd ever seen—”

“... carved the runes onto your bones—”

“... infused your DNA—”

KNOCK.

Fire. There’s fire in my veins, inside of my mind. It's too much. I'm writhing, tensing in agony and my cup shatters in my fist. Ceramic shards pierce my palm. Dozens. I’m bleeding. There's my blood all over the kitchen tile and it belongs to me, and it's blacker than empty space.

“... meant to be our savior, Quinn—”

“... but you’re falling apart—”

“... reality is crumbling—”

“... people will die—”

“... take the pill—”

“... hurry—”

My head splits. All at once, I'm screaming and crying and my eyes are bulging out of my skull. There's acid in my veins. It's pumping through me like radioactive waste, making me shriveled and weak and nauseous and–

Alarm.

There's an alarm ringing, a fire alarm. It's sounding from the hallway and there's a stampede of movement as the apartment begins to evacuate. 

I take a breath. Stagger upright. 

It's gone. 

The pain, I mean. The pain and the pressure, the acid in my veins, the dying of thirst and the burning from the inside-out is all gone. I'm me again. 

Oh god, I’m me again.

My apartment is a crumpled heap. It's a mess of splintered wood and snapping livewires, of broken pipes and…

And crying. 

Somebody's crying. Their voice is coming from the rubble of my collapsed ceiling, and I wonder who I've added to my list of murders as I fall onto my hands and knees and start to dig. 

“Why?” I shout, tossing debris out of the way. “Why is this happening to me?”  

And there it is. The source of the whimpering, the source of the tears. My phone. Dr. Wilkins is sobbing into the speaker.

“I’ve been trying to tell you why, Quinn…,” she says, her voice thick with grief. “For the last twenty minutes I’ve been trying to tell you…”

“I’m sorry,” I stammer. “I was… I was having some kind of episode, but it’s over now. I’m better, I think. Everything’s fine and–” 

“No,” she tells me. “You aren’t better, and nothing's fine.”

KNOCK. KNOCK. 

My heart sinks like a stone.

This isn't like her. She's always told me to be positive, that I could do great things if I put my mind to it. Now, she sounds certain of my failure.

“Hold on,” I say, doing my best to ignore the pit in my gut. “You said I could make the world a better place, didn't you? Well, now that I know what I’m capable of–”

“It doesn’t matter,” she sobs. “Nothing matters anymore. It’s too late for you, for me, for every last soul on this planet. It’s too late, Quinn. I'm sorry.”

I shake my head. “No. You're just drunk.”

“It's more than that.”

“Then what is it?” I say, and there's a hint of panic in my voice. 

“I can hear it.”

KNOCK. 

“Hear what?” I ask, wishing she'd say something to reassure me. Anything.

KNOCK. 

“I’ve heard it all night,” she says, “ever since you called.”

KNOCK.  

“It isn’t an artifact of your imagination.”

KNOCK.

“It’s real.”

KNOCK. 

“The truth is, we put more than drugs inside of you.”

KNOCK. 

“Much more.”

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

I stumble back against what’s left of my kitchen counter. I’m hyperventilating. It’s my chest. There’s something inside of it, some tightness. It’s beating against my ribs, pounding and thundering and it’s so loud, loud enough that it almost sounds like…

KNOCK. KNOCK. 

No.

“We thought it’d remain dormant. We really did.”


KNOCK. 

No. Please no… Anything but this. 

“We didn’t even think it’d work. At least, I didn’t.”

KNOCK. 

“I mean, the thing with the tablet, and the ritual, and the virgin sacrifice?”

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

“It seemed like nonsense…”

KNOCK.

“....but we started seeing mutations in your DNA, and your gifts began to manifest…”

KNOCK. KNOCK.

She's lying. 

This is what she does, isn't it? Always. She lies and she lies and she– 

“ARRGHH!”

Pressure. There's a pounding pressure in my chest like fists on a drum.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

“... last year we translated the other half of the tablet. The one from Sumeria. The things it spoke about… God help us, they were terrifying…”

Fingernails. I feel fingernails against my ribs, feel something raking, clawing at my skin like it's trying to get out.


“We put that inside of you,” Dr Wilkins sobs.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

“I'm sorry.”

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

“I'm so fucking sorry, Quinn.”

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

“We thought we were creating a messiah.”

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.
