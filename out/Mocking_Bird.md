I don't really do much with my life... Socially at least.

Day to day everybody seems to be preoccupied with their friends and their activities, and they seem to be so fulfilled by it... but I've never understood it.

It's not that I hate people, I just feel like they complicate things more than they need to be... and I prefer not to spend too much time around them.

I enjoy small chunks of people's company don't get me wrong, I've just always leaned more to the introverted side of things.

I'd rather just be by myself, going on walks like I usually do.

I enjoy nature and the animals that surround it, they don't seem to cause as much drama as... people... the animals just mind their own business.

There's an overgrown trail way off in the bush that I like walking along.

It's pretty well known in the small area I live in so, even though it's pretty out of the way you do see people walking along it occasionally... just not very often, which is the way I like it.

While walking down the trail I take in the scents and the sounds, my favorite sounds of all though are the birds.

There are so many of them, there are so many different species around where I live and they all make different calls, it's like they're from a different planet all together...They're weird... but I like them.

Through my walks I've learned to match practically every call to each corresponding bird...Except for one...I don't know what it looks like but it sounds nothing like the rest of them, and I only just started hearing this bird recently.

Many weeks and walks went by without me finding the answer to that question: What kind of bird is making that sound?

One day I was on a walk down the same trail and I came across a pretty large man I've never seen before, he wasn't fat or anything just... Big... he was intimidating.

He was stood at the side of the trail completely still, aiming his camera up towards the trees.

I guess there was some type of rare bird he was looking to take a picture of... Sometimes you see that down here.

Excitement filled me as I realized that maybe he had the answer to what type of bird I was hearing, maybe that's what he was trying to take a picture of!

I went up to him planning to introduce himself so I could ask him.

He seemed really standoffish and almost rude, I don't know why...

Maybe I scared off the bird he was trying to take a picture of?

All I know is I never got my answer and he stormed off before I could even get his name... wasn't much of a people person I guess... and here I thought that was me.

A couple more weeks went by and I was walking down the trail again, except this time there were a ton of police officers surrounding the side of the trail up ahead.

As I got closer one of them noticed me and came running towards me, telling me not to come near the area because it was an active crime scene.

I asked what had happened, he looked extremely stressed... He wouldn't give me any real details which made me wonder if it was something actually serious.

All he asked me was if I'd seen a tall large man around the area lately...

I gave him a description, told him the little bit I knew, and I went home thinking I would never hear about it again.

That situation freaked me out a bit so I haven't gone on walks for a while, I've just been at my house for weeks... I just had a really bad feeling about all of this... My imagination was probably just getting the best of me.

I was bored and flicking through the channels when something caught my attention.

The news... and a very familiar face.

The man I saw that day was charged with several counts of murder.

What I encountered that day was a serial killer... My hands started to shake.

He wasn't any ordinary serial killer though, they explained... he had his... signatures, that he would leave behind.

He would leave physical impressions on these people so the police knew they were dealing with the same lunatic, he was taunting them.

Every victim would be taken out to the forest, tied up so tightly that they couldn't move a finger, and he would leave them out there to rot.

That wasn't the worst part though...

He would skillfully, with almost surgical precision, cut out a very specific piece of their esophagus... Changing how the air would travel through their throat... like he was carving out a musical instrument.

In such a way...

That if they tried to make a sound... People wouldn't bat an eye.

In SUCH a way...

That when they cried for help...

They would only blend into the background, inadvertently mimicking the sounds of nature that hopelessly surrounded them.
