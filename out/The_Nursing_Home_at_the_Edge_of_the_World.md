His hair was wispy and thin, pressed flat atop his wet head. His stomach bloated out almost as far as he was tall, a purple and red spiderweb emanating up towards his narrow chest. His hands and feet hung down limply, motionless and blue. His entire body was so small that it was as if the universe itself was trying to hide him from us. Within my mother's arms was the most beautiful baby boy in the world, and we called him Johnny. 

Johnny was born over four months early, at the weight of one pound and four ounces. The first night was a living hell, not knowing why he was born so early or if he would be able to survive. The nurses and doctors worked all night, and then the night after that, non-stop to stabilize his vitals. Their eyes sunken and baggy, they looked exhausted, but none more so than my mother. 

After a week they said he was out of the danger period, the worst had hopefully passed. It would be a long time before he could be brought home, but within the NICU, he would continue to develop and grow into a strong baby boy. And grow he did.  Two months later he had grown to almost four pounds, a much healthier weight to maintain organs and muscle tissue. But as his body grew, not all of his organs grew with him.

Johnny, at four pounds, still had the same size lungs he did when he weighed just over one pound. He fought for every breath, but he did fight. With the assistance of the machines in the hospital, they helped maintain and stabilize his body as he kept growing. 

He quickly became the favorite of the nurses in the care unit. My mom even made jokes about how much of a ladies man he was already, being so loved and doted on. The doctor told me they had never seen a premature infant be so perceptive and reactive to the world around him. He told me Johnny always seemed to breathe a little easier when I was in the room, like he could sense big brother was there.

Four months after his birth, he was eleven pounds, his arms and legs appearing well filled out. Visually, he looked like a perfectly healthy baby boy. His lungs still hadn't grown. The machines needed to keep him alive now dwarfed his tiny body, the sunlight of the window unable to reach him past them all. 

Another month after that, the doctors pulled my mother and her husband aside for a talk. His body had been growing well, except for his lungs, up until that point, but they had discovered a problem. His lungs, already small as they were, showed signs of shrinkage. Even with the machines his body began to show signs of oxygen-deprived blood cells and brain tissue. The doctor believed there was nothing that could be done for him; my brother's fight was over. 

My mother had a difficult decision to make, but she made her choice. A few days later, in a room full of family, the doctor turned off Johnny's life support at my mother's request. She held him in her arms the whole time, singing a soft, broken lullaby to him, until eventually his cooing stopped. As I stepped out of the last resident's room, I wondered what Johnny would say to his big brother if he were still alive to see me take their lives.

Would he understand why I made that decision? Or perhaps he would disagree with it, trying harder to find a way to keep everyone alive. Or maybe he wouldn’t have stayed here with Mom at all. Maybe it's just because I only knew him as a baby, but I like to think he would have been a better person than I. But between killing them and letting them die, I'm not sure which a better person would have chosen anyway. 

Six of them were in their beds, most of whom were still asleep from the night prior. I used a pillow to suffocate them. It was the most peaceful way I could think of, aside from wasting the remainder of our medicine on overdosing them. A few of them fought back at first, but most didn't. Why most of them didn't struggle and others did, I don't know. Truth be told, I never got to know any of them as much as I should have. 

I cried for them, too, every single one. After I was sure they were gone, I stepped out of the room and took a breather to dry my tears and reapply my smile. I didn't want their last sight of a friendly face to be one of guilt and pain; they didn't deserve that. After those six were done, the only one left was the chubby, old man with the beard in the wheelchair, but when I found him in the hallway I saw he had died in his sleep. He still looked like he could wake up any moment, but from the paleness of his skin and its frigid temperature, I believe he had been dead for a few days already. If I had done a better job I might have noticed.

Once everyone was laid to rest I took some time to calm myself down. I took a long, hot shower in one of the vacant rooms. I didn't look dirty, but I felt filthy. Every other minute, I popped my head out to make sure I was still alone in the room. It wasn't the first time in the last few days I felt like a scared, stressed-out little kid. 

After that, I made sure my mom ate some food and drank some water, and watched another movie with her. This time, I played one of her favorites, an older movie from when she was younger. Just like always, she fell asleep about halfway through, and I took that as my cue to leave. I made my way back to the staircase leading up to the third floor. 

I learned where the light switches were and, just in case, I brought a flashlight to help me. I had also come up with a plan. The monster up above walked right by me and didn't turn to look at me; it only reacted when I made some kind of noise. Even with her face pressed against the glass, it felt like she wasn't really looking at me; I just happened to be standing in front of her. I could only assume that she was blind, or at least close enough to it. 

It would be risky and slow going, but if I moved in time with the stereo system turning on and off, I should be able to get around well enough. Her being blind also means that I should be safe to turn the lights on, too. As long as I could overcome my fear enough to check a few rooms for morphine, I thought I'd be okay. 

Eventually, my body moved on its own while my mind drifted, and I found myself in front of the third-story door once again. The short, three-foot space between the door and the first step felt like a sterile, stretching hallway. I crept cautiously up to it, one hand holding the flashlight. After a brief moment's pause, I quietly opened the door and focused on the silence that met me there.

Nothing. No horrifying noise, no shambling monster just within view, no invisible hands wrapping around my neck to pull me in. Just the stench of death, and an oppressive absence of sound. 

Once more, I saw a few feet of light leading through the room containing the entrance to the stairs and elevator. Just past that was absolute pitch blackness, leading into the three hallways branching from the center nurses' desk. 

I waited patiently for the music to return, every hopeful second contorting and stretching to be longer than the last. Somehow, despite my waiting, when the music finally turned on, it still made me jump. My hand twitched and clicked on the flashlight. It's bright light extended fifteen feet out before running into a wall, excess light spilling out to form rough, unfocused edges to the beam.

I moved it around a little before I took any steps. In front of me I saw a few empty wheelchairs, a mobile work station, and the first body. It lay flat on the ground face up, most of the flesh of its body gone, seeped into the floor underneath. Long gray hair lay on the ground, separate from their head, and bits of bone poked out of what remained of its grey, spoiled skin. A few feet out on all sides, a deep, rotted brown stained the floor. 

I tried to remain in the same position, unmoving, despite feeling the imaginary eyes of the corpse on me. It was an attempt to gauge the length of the music; If I was to move safely through this floor I couldn't just walk aimlessly. By my count, about ninety seconds passed before the music turned off again, and I was met with total stillness. Ninety more seconds passed, and the music turned back on. 

1…2…3…

Counting in my head again, I moved out towards the nurse's desk. If they were in the same place as downstairs, then that's where the light switches would be. I swept the light back and forth around me frantically, but still I didn't see anything move. Fumbling with my hands, I found the panel of switches and one by one began to flip them.

32…33…34…

None of them did anything. The floor was still encased in darkness, but I did have another idea. I tried not to waste time and moved past the desk and down the first hallway. At the end of each hallway was a window that I could use to illuminate it; I just needed to open the blinds. But as I shined the light down the hallways to make sure nothing was moving, my eyes caught the sight of something strange. 

71…72…73…

Blocking the entry to the first door was a wheelchair, containing an older, skinny lady. Her threadlike hair was grey, her skin as thin as paper, and her eyes were wide open. She looked at me, and almost on instinct, I stepped to the side, but her eyes didn’t follow me. She, too, was blind up here. It was Mrs. Dawson, and if I needed to get in that room, I would need to move her. 

The music turned off once more, a hint of feedback burping through the speakers as it did. I was so preoccupied by her that I had forgotten to finish my count. I stood perfectly still, straining my eyes and light on the woman and my ears on the floor behind me. Still nothing, no sound of movement or teeth clacking. Mrs. Dawson's eyes were staring straight ahead of her, like a dog. Thankfully, she didn’t move an inch. I’m not sure if my pounding heart could have taken it if she chose to get up. After another ninety seconds, our macabre one-sided staring contest came to an end, the sudden music forcing a blink out of me. When my eyes opened, she was still there, staring into nothing.

1…2…3…

I took a step around her, further down the hallway. This wasn’t Mrs. Dawson. I knew that it couldn’t be. I saw her body down the elevator shaft. This was either some incredulous projection of my imagination, or somehow, she was related to what happened three months ago. Locked inside this building, I had next to no knowledge of the state of the world outside, beyond what I saw happen through the windows as I chained up the doors, and listened to the radio. All I know is that I’m one of the lucky ones.

22…23…24…

I took long, striding steps, trying to make good time. I reached the end of the hallway before I could count to thirty, and grasped at the string for the blinds with a desperation I didn’t know I had in me. I pulled it down hard and yanked it to the side, and immediately the hallway was bathed in a crusty yellow light. Even if the bedrooms would still be dark, the hallway was at least dimly lit. The light reached further than I thought, just past the edge of the hallway and barely into the center of the floor with the nurse’s desk. With my count still maintained in my head, I wasted no time and reached for the handle of the closest room to where I stood. 

The door opened smoothly, but the wall of scent was coarse as it greeted my nose. It was putrid, the scent of decay wafting up my nose and almost drawing a tear down my cheek. My eyes skipped between Mrs. Dawson and inside the room, but neither offered any fresh information. Mrs. Dawson remained immobile, and inside the room remained pitch black. I twisted my hand to shine the flashlight inside and was greeted with a bouquet of rot.

57…58…59…

The light shone past a closet and bathroom door and directly onto a bed. On the bed was another corpse, deep into the stages of decomposition. I could count individual rib bones protruding up from the blanket lying on top of the body. The head wasn’t much more than a skull, any flesh long gone and soaked into the mattress underneath, paper mache skin stuck to the skull like a kid's art project. The body was jet black, the previously white sheets and blanket on top stained a deep, dark brown. Extending out from the body were tubes leading to a machine on the floor, the same kind of machine that my mother had.

I walked around the other side of the bed, using my free hand to plug my nose. To my dismay, I saw that the machine was just as run down and broken as the body. The main chamber meant to hold the morphine was broken, the vial inside empty and useless to me. I wondered, for a moment, what this person's story was. What kind of life did they live before their family abandoned them here? If their family abandoned them here, I wondered, or if there was no one left to rescue them. If they were just another ancient relic that the nursing home collected.

79…80…81…

I turned around, angry at myself for wasting time thinking about the person in that room, and made it back to the doorway. I stepped back into the hallway, the anxiety in my head amplified with every second I counted. As my count grew closer and closer to its ultimum, I stepped into the hallway and immediately took a step back into the room. I reached my hand out to grab the door, eager to slam it shut and barricade myself in, but I was too slow.

88…89…90…

The man's deep baritone singing ceased, the buzz of the speakers not far behind. Left in the music's wake, at the end of the hallway, was the sound of something heavy dragging, followed by a sharp clacking.

Skrrrt….click…clack….

At the end of the hallway I saw my mother, and she was creeping her way closer to me. I stood in the doorway, the sound of her moving in front of me, and the stench of the body behind me. Both sides felt like rancid bulwarks, preventing me from moving in any direction. 

1…2…3…

She crept closer, step by step, drag by drag. I had no way of knowing if she was coming towards me specifically or if she was searching for something else entirely. I just knew that she was coming down this hallway. 

12…13…14…

Closer she crept, and I watched her the whole time. I saw her drag her long leg past Mrs. Dawson and to the next door in the hallway. She moved slowly, each step taking her a few seconds. I felt petrified, afraid that any step of mine would make some kind of noise to break the silence of the third floor. I stood still in the doorway, patiently hoping that the music would start before I needed to act.

23…24…25…

The details of my mother's face drew closer and closer, shambling down the hallway. She seemed ignorant of anything around her, walking into one wall just to adjust her direction to walk into another.

39…40…41…

She was just a few feet away now, and I had to decide whether to move or not. I chose to push my luck. I swung the door almost shut, its hinges thankfully making no sound. I kept it a few inches open, both to avoid the clicking sound of it shutting and to keep a crevice of sight leading into the hallway.

It was near-perfect timing, as not two seconds later, the opening was darkened by the moving mass. I felt a pressure on the door I held, gentle at first but growing stronger. The sound of her teeth gnashing felt like it was inside my ears. I pushed back on the door, using my foot as a doorstop in an effort to make her go away. 

66…67…68…

The pressure built further for a few seconds, then all at once it eased off. I almost accidentally slammed the door shut, just narrowly holding it back. I listened to her take a few steps away from the door, hit the wall on the other side, and then begin to make her way back down the hallway. She was gone, for now. 

Eventually, the music turned back on, but I still didn't move. I remained behind the door, taking deep and gasping breaths to calm myself down. I waited for another cycle, hearing the thing move further away. Once the music started once more, I worked my way into the door across the hall.

It was empty, of both morphine and people. So I tried the room after that, then the next room again. One by one, at a snail's pace, I searched every single room I could get into. Some of the rooms were locked, but there was no way I was going to look for any keys; I just ignored them.

It was slow going, every few minutes having to wait for a cycle or two inside a room as my mother dragged past. It took roughly an hour before I had most of the floor cleared, including the staff room. And yet, no morphine for my mother. There was only one room I had yet to check, and it was the one Mrs. Dawson was sat directly in front of. 

Within my very bones, I felt every part of my body scream at me to just go back downstairs. My body told me with absolute certainty that there was nothing beyond that door worth dying for, and in my mind, I knew it to be true.

What was worth dying for was on the floor beneath this one. For her, I would move Mrs. Dawson. So I made my way over to her, maintaining my count as I did. 

55…56…57…

I crossed the nurse's desk, and already I could see her staring at me. I couldn't rip my eyes away from hers as I walked past and around her. I couldn't read what it was she was thinking, if whatever this was even could think. 

71…72…73…

I positioned myself behind her and gripped the handles of her wheelchair. She didn't budge. I kept my count in my head, waiting for the music to end and then start once more. Unlike when I took that step into the hallway yesterday, it took me a moment to realize my mistake.

After the music ended, I waited in the silence, counting and listening closely. As my count approached ninety, I gripped the handles a little bit tighter and readied myself to move. The music didn't start. 

A startlingly loud pop and static cracked through the speakers, then a gentle, quiet hum. After a few seconds, the hum ceased, too. I waited, white knuckled, for three more minutes. The music didn't return. But I did hear something, the sound of something being dragged, then the clacking of teeth. I needed to move.

My grip stayed tight, and I felt the skin on the back of my neck begin to itch with anxiety. I couldn't see around the corner the sound came from, but within the wilted light, I could see the tip of her shadow. With every drag of her leg, the shadow came closer. 

My mind was torn between standing still, hoping she wouldn't come my direction, and just moving the wheelchair anyway. I thought of just ripping it off like a Band-Aid, shoving it hard, and running into the room.

What if the door’s locked?

A horrible thought, one I wish my mind hadn't conjured. Slowly, I unfurled one hand from the wheelchair and raised it to the door handle. I could hear my bones creaking as my arm moved. They sounded as loud as firecrackers to my ears, but thankfully, I didn't hear any rapid movement. 

I gripped the handle and took a shaky, quiet breath. The handle moved, and the door wasn't locked. Unfortunately, as if by some cruel divine joke, that handle was the creakiest, loudest door handle I've ever heard. 

Immediately, I heard a powerful stomp, and the shadow shot forward and around the corner. Once more, I saw my mother, her bottom jaw hanging close to her sternum. The sight of her gaping maw paralyzed me for a moment, but the impossibly loud smashing noise as she slammed it shut set my body ablaze. I barely had time to recognize her milky white eyes when my body moved on its own. 

I shoved Mrs. Dawson forward as hard as I could. She shot out and slammed into the creature with a fleshy thud. The seat of the wheelchair collided with her upper knee, and it buckled. I didn't wait to watch the amalgam of flying limbs and metal. I rushed to open the door and get myself through as fast as I could. Something swished past my head as I entered, and when I looked back to close the door, I saw the crooked hand, the one at the end of the two elbows, embedded in the wall next to me. 

With a hard slam, I shut the door and took a moment to collect myself. I began to fully grasp how stupid I was in that moment. There was no way I could think of to leave this room safely. Even IF there was what I needed in this room, the second I turned that door handle to leave, it would be right back on me. It would be borderline impossible for me to get back to the elevator room alive.

I had all but given up on the morphine at that point, but still, I took a look behind me at the room. It was pitch black, and I had dropped my flashlight getting in. So I fumbled my way towards the curtains and opened them up, blinding myself just as my eyes adjusted to the dark. A bright pink, purple, and gold light flowed into the room. I had been up here so long that it was already sunset. 

The room was mostly empty, save for two things. A bed, with some lump under the covers, and just beside it a machine, one just like my mom's. Inside the machine was a clearly labeled vial of morphine, full and intact. A tube leading off from the machine led under the covers. The brief feeling of relief was overshadowed after only a few seconds when I saw the lump move. 

It shifted, just a little bit. But it did move, I know I didn't imagine it. The lump also produced a noise, which sounded to me like soft, gentle breathing. I didn’t really know what else there was for me to do, so I pulled the covers back. They slid softly and smoothly apart, like they had been recently washed. Lying on the mattress, with a tube connected to a needle inserted into its arm, was a small baby.

It had wispy, thin hair plastered atop its head, and its stomach was bloated out almost as far as the baby was tall. A red and purple spider web spread over his torso, practically erupting from his belly button and towards his chest. His eyes were closed, seemingly dreaming a peaceful dream. If it weren’t for the baby's steady breathing, I wouldn't even know it was alive. Somehow, in this random room on the third floor of a random nursing home, there was this baby that looked exactly like my brother.

Except he was different. My brother was dead, there was no bringing him back, as painful as it was to see him again. But no amount of rational thinking would make this any easier; it took all my willpower not to scoop him into my arms as soon as I saw him. I wanted to hold him, keep him warm, and bring him downstairs. If my mother saw him, maybe she could die happy. But this wasn’t Johnny, it was impossible. I walked over to the machine by him and popped open the plastic window to release the vial of morphine inside. After quickly taking the syringe leading to the IV tube out of the vial, I dropped it into my pocket. 

Johnny made a soft cooing noise, and I thought I could physically feel my heart rip just a little. I stood there for what was probably five minutes, thinking. I still didn’t have a plan on how to get out, so I figured sticking around for just a little bit longer couldn’t hurt. And, while I was there, maybe I could hold my brother just one more time. 

I reached out to his arm and gently applied pressure with one hand and removed the syringe with the other. His face shifted with some discomfort, but only for a flash before it went back to total serenity. I grabbed him from underneath, making sure to support his head in the crook of my elbow. He looked exactly the same as he did four years ago, as he fell asleep for the last time in my mother's arms. Even his smell was the same as I lifted him. A few seconds passed, and slowly, almost imperceptibly, he began to open his eyes. I watched with hushed breathing, waiting to see what he would do after he opened them. 

After a while, his eyes were fully opened, but something about them was wrong. His eyes were not the caramel brown that I knew, but instead a milky, swirling white. They looked exactly like the eyes of both the things pretending to be people on this floor. Then Johnny opened his mouth, just as slowly as he had opened his eyes. Wider and wider it opened, and I stood there stunned all the while. Just like what I had seen yesterday, the top of his head moved just as far up and back as his bottom jaw moved down. I felt it press into my arm, and his head rolled back, but his neck didn’t follow. In horror, I watched as my little brother turned his own throat inside out, as if he unrolled his head onto his neck. The tallest point on his body now his uvula, as it stuck straight up like a vile antenna. Then he began to scream. 

It was a scream deeper than his body should have been able to produce, and right away, I dropped him. His little body slammed into the floor with a fleshy thud. The door leading into this room shuddered as a heavy slam pounded into it. This is it, I thought, I was going to die here. The thought didn’t last long, though, as it was overtaken by an incredible pain. It felt like someone was pressing a hot iron into my gray matter and cooking it. My legs buckled out from underneath me, and my vision began to swirl. I think I might have hit my head when I fell, I can’t remember exactly. The most present thing in my memory was the smell.

It smelled like rotting meat, like someone had left a steak in the sun for a week and decided to microwave it. My body tried to gag, but as I felt the bile rising from my stomach, I tried to open my mouth and found that I couldn’t. When I went to move my jaw, one of my pinkies moved. I felt the acid from my stomach burn my throat, and it began to build pressure behind my teeth. I tried to open my mouth for release again and found one of my eyelids shut instead. I heard a slight drip of my vomit hitting the floor, and I realized it was leaking out of one side of my mouth. I just couldn’t feel it due to how numb my cheek was. I was having another stroke.

My body tried to force in a breath, and some of my bile sucked its way back down my throat, and I began to choke. The door was slammed into again, and I remember being confused, as if I didn’t know why it was happening. I lay on the floor next to my brother, choking on my vomit, convulsing. Somehow, I managed, through great effort, to roll onto my side. The dam finally broke, and my mouth was forced open by a great pressure. It could have been a drop of bile, it could have been a gallon. Either way, it felt like I wrung myself dry in that room, like every meal I had ever eaten wound up on that floor, but still I smelled it. That rotting, foul stench. It didn’t just smell like bad meat, it smelled as if the very flesh under my nose was rotting.

The floor underneath me felt like a raft on the ocean, shifting and moving underneath me. I tried to move myself up, but my body wouldn’t listen; I couldn’t even try to think clearly if I wanted to. The first stroke I suffered, the space around me became foreign and incomprehensible. This time, even if a little warped, I could understand where I was. I just couldn’t for the life of me grasp why I was there. It was like my mind was a fresh newborn, and I had to relearn how to move in a body that didn’t work. Before, I could try to move a limb, even if it didn’t work. This time, I didn’t know where my limbs were, or what they were. My arms might as well have belonged to a stranger. 

To anyone who may be reading this, I’m sorry, I really am, but I don’t know how I got out. Back on the floor of that room upstairs, with the door being broken down by some monster, I lost consciousness. All I know is that somehow, some way, I woke up once more in my mother's room. I was sitting in the chair I always sit in, and in my arms was the freakish recreation of my brother, Johnny. 

His eyes were still open, appearing like one massive cataract. His mouth wasn’t agape, thankfully. My body was sore, just like the other day. Every joint I had felt stiff, and when I moved, it felt like they ground like stones.  From my mother's window I could see that it was pitch black outside. It might not have been as long as last time, but at least a few hours had passed. I looked at my mother and could feel the weight of the morphine still in my pants pocket. 

At first glance, she looked asleep, but as my heart sank into my stomach, I could see that she was already long gone. Decorating her chin were chunks of dried sludge and caked-on food, all of it seeping out of the bottom slope of her mouth. Dribbling from her nose was brown, dried bile. Some time when I was away, she had thrown up, and couldn’t open her mouth wide enough to release it. In my absence, she had choked on her own vomit. In between her pursed lips was a chunk of food plugging her mouth, and I recognized it immediately; it was a bite-sized piece of a pancake, cut slightly too big.

My heart felt empty, it still does even as I write this. I didn't cry, I felt more numb than anything else. I knew she didn’t have long left, it was obvious to my whole family, and that was before the end of the world. I had just hoped I would have a few more weeks, at least. Now I was alone, the only people left, if you could call them that, were me and the two monsters upstairs, as well as my brother in my arms. I looked down at him once more, and in my numbness, I still felt a feeling of protectiveness creep in. This wasn’t my little brother, but he at least looked like him, and maybe that meant something. I stood up and placed him on my mother's lap. 

Immediately, he crawled off and landed with a thud on the floor. If it bothered him, he didn’t show it as he crawled towards the door. I walked over and opened it, and he crawled right on through. Like he was on a mission, he crawled straight towards the elevator room. I followed, my morbid curiosity looking for anything to distract me from my mother. I pushed open the door to the staircase for him, and up he crawled. I stood at the bottom watching him for a while, wondering if it was worth following him. I noticed then that one of my legs struggled a bit more than the other, but I followed it up and opened the door to the third floor for him. In he went, as soon as the door opened wide enough for him to squeeze his little body through. I shut the door and decided that I didn’t need to know where he would crawl next, and headed back downstairs. 

My mind tried to dwell on anything but my mother, like how hard that thing had worked to get back to the third floor for some reason, or how empty the whole building felt now that everyone was dead. The only sound to keep me company was the music, or at least what I used to think was music. I can hear it now, just as clearly as I did the first time. I wasn’t imagining it, it is the Lord's prayer. It played on loop, with a man's deep voice speaking the prayer the entire time, to the tune of a gentle guitar and piano in the background.

I didn’t sleep that night, I was too busy packing. I packed medicine, what little we had; I packed food, what bits were left; and I packed water, as many bottles as I could fit in my bag. After that, I knelt by my mother's bed and cried my soul out. The light of the dawn crept through the windows by the time I was both packed and mentally recovered. I went downstairs, making sure I was signed into the guest book one final time, and wrote all of this down. I plan on leaving this place, if you couldn’t tell. A death sentence, probably, but that’s all I’d get here anyway. I might as well try to survive before I die.

I took one more day to go room by room, person by person, and cross-reference them to the listings I have in the offices on the first floor. I learned all the names of the people whose lives I took, and made sure to memorize all seven of them. Just in case, I wrote them down and slipped the paper into my pocket, right next to the vial of morphine still sitting there. After that, I walked to the front doors of the building and removed the chains I had placed three months ago. I opened the door, and against my better judgment, I took a peek outside.

The streets were entirely barren, and dead silent. The closest building was about one thousand feet away, and on its roof, I could see at least a dozen figures standing there. It was too far to see any details, but each one looked like a resident I had met here in the nursing home. A few of them even looked like my mother. I closed the door and went back inside, and got some more rest. It’s nighttime as I write this, and tomorrow morning I’ll be leaving this God-forsaken place. 

I don’t know how long I’ll survive out there, maybe hours, maybe days. If, somehow, this makes it on one of the websites still working, I’m sure I don’t need to explain what’s out there waiting for me. You probably know what happened to the world better than I do, anyway. So before I go, I’ll leave you with this message. 

I am writing this from somewhere in Connecticut. It’s a small town, hard to find if you aren’t looking for it. On the hill at the back end of town is a nursing home, and if you find yourself looking for shelter, it will offer none. There is no food here, there is no life here, and there is no God here. It might as well be a nursing home at the edge of the world.
