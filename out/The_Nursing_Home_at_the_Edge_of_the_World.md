The pancakes were the perfect shade of golden. They were fluffy but dense enough to hold up to the maple syrup. The syrup ran down the side of the stack, the rounded edges almost voluptuous. On top was a picturesque, half-melted pat of butter. The plate sat on a tray next to another containing eggs with yolks as yellow as the sun and bacon that smelled like a freshly made campfire. On this tray was the most beautiful breakfast in the world.



The day I got accepted into college, my mom cooked me that breakfast: a tall stack of pancakes, two over-easy eggs, and a helping of bacon she had smoked herself in her husband's smoker just the week before. I had no idea what all the excitement was about when she woke me up. It turns out she opened my acceptance letter while I was asleep. I couldn't be mad; I was too excited, even in my half-awake state. 



She was a high school dropout, having me when she was seventeen years old. When I got into college, she was able to live vicariously through me. She wanted me to tell her all about my classes, the dorms, and my teachers, everything from annoying roommates to cute girls in my class. When I was younger, and more naive, I found it irritating that she had such an investment in my personal life. 



As annoying as I thought those questions were, I didn't realize just how much they meant to me until she lost her voice. There I stood, years later, standing with a plate of roughly chopped pancakes in front of my mom in her room. In my pocket was her insulin pen, which I had already calculated so she could enjoy breakfast. I set the plate down on her table next to her bed and poured some sugar-free syrup on top, two packets, just how she liked it. 



“I cut it up for you, Mom. It should go down easy, but I can blend it if you need me to.”



“Mmurrnngg…” She managed to open her mouth just barely wide enough for me to place a piece of pancake inside.



She couldn't open it wide enough for a fork, so I used the other end of the sponge swab to poke the pieces like a toothpick. Every few bites, I soaked the small sponge end in her thickened water and stuck it in her mouth so she could drink it. Then I made sure to clean up any drool or spilled water from the sloped edge of her mouth.



It was a long process, so I always made sure to feed my mom after the other residents. Out of all the folks left in this nursing home, she was one of only three who had trouble feeding themselves. It's probably wrong of me to admit it, but for the other two, I just blended the food so I could get to my mom a little bit faster. 



This was around noon the day after my incident, more of a brunch than a breakfast. I didn’t think about it much yesterday because I was busy taking care of the people living here, but I began to realize I might be in serious trouble. My head still hurt from hitting it, that weird blaring horn, the smell of burning toast, hallucinating the strange music turning into prayer, and the total loss of my faculties for at least eight hours. I’m not sure what could have caused my stroke, but I need to find out.



I thought it would be easy; this was a nursing home, after all. Back when there were real nurses here, they would have people come apprentice from med school all the time, so there were bound to be a few medical books for me to look through. Most of the apprenticeships got sent to the third floor, but all of their lockers where they would store things would be on the first.



After I had changed all the diapers, emptied catheter bags, cooked everyone food, and given everyone their medicine last night (this morning?) I changed out of my uniform. I signed back in as a guest and looked for any info, but nothing turned up. I did find a few books, but none of them had any real medical info in them. I tried the computer, but unsurprisingly, almost every website was down; any websites that weren’t had the emergency broadcast taking up most of the page. I'm surprised I could even find a place to post my journal.



All of my free time before I had to be a nurse again was spent trying to find any info instead of sleep, but no luck. Around nine this morning, I went back into the storage room, stripped down bare, and changed back into a dull blue nurse outfit, this time fitting a little snugly. I cooked up some crappy pancakes with some dry pancake mix, making sure to pay attention to how each resident liked their food and their dietary restrictions. I had run out of ingredients for real pancakes a month ago, and just last week, I used the last of the frozen breakfast sausages and bacon. It wasn’t much, I thought, but it would have to do.



After everyone was fed, including my mom, I put the uniform away again and signed back in as a guest once more. This time, despite how much I dreaded it, I would search the third floor for any answers. 



This isn’t something I like to admit willingly, and if you are out there reading this, I hope you don’t think less of me for it, but I am only one man. Thirty people were living on the third floor, I saw maybe seven or eight get taken by their families when everyone evacuated. The rest stayed up there, and like I mentioned in yesterday's log, I’ve only been up there two or three times. None of those were in the last few months. I left them up there alone to die. I am only one man, and I can only take care of so many people. I’m not sure if it makes me a bad person. I try not to think about it; that isn’t for me to decide anyway.



Every step I took up towards the third floor injected a new memory into my mind. With one step, I thought of the old man I used to play chess with in the room beside my mom, and with the next, I thought of the kind older attendant who used to bring food from her home for my mom to enjoy. Another step reminded me of the annoying janitor who used to walk in without knocking, interrupting the movies my mom and I would watch to take out her trash. 



As I got to the door of the third floor, I paused for a moment to get lost in my sentimentality. That pause was why I heard it. A hefty, drawn-out sound came from just beyond the door my hand hovered over the handle of. The sound of something heavy being dragged. I strained my ears, thinking I must be imagining things. Horrible as it felt to think of it, *no one* on the third floor could be alive. There wasn’t any food, and if someone had been going down to the kitchen for some, I would have seen them by now. That’s not even considering the fact that everyone who was left up here wasn’t capable of living without help; they were either in hospice or not far from it. 



I steeled my resolve and wrapped my hand around the handle. It turned smoothly and silently, but before I opened the door, I heard it once more. In the empty void of the stairway, away from the music, I heard the sound of something being dragged a few feet from the door, then this time the sound of something clacking together. 



*Sskrrrr…Click click…*



There was nothing up here, it was all in my head, I thought. I was imagining things, and I needed to look for information on how to help myself. I waited a moment longer, and when I didn’t hear it again, I moved my arm before my brain could tell me otherwise. The hinges of the door were well-greased and as silent as death itself. A retched sweet and sour smell only familiar to me through the rooms containing decaying bodies downstairs sat heavy in the air. Past the door was a wall of absolute darkness; the entire third floor was pitch black. 



Well, not the entire floor was dark, I suppose. The sterile white light coming from the fluorescent bulbs in the stairway managed to light the room the stairs and elevator were in, as well as a few feet past the open doorway into the main hallway. Just a couple feet past that doorway was a veritable event horizon. Standing there, I realized for the first time that I never even bothered to learn where the light switches are in the hallways, only the bedrooms. 



I was scared, honestly. I don’t consider myself a particularly brave man, but likewise, I've never been one to get scared too easily either. But standing at the precipice of a void that I knew for certain contained at least twenty corpses set every hair on my body standing straight up. When the music started I damn near lept out of my own skin.



I hadn’t even realized it, but the music I was so used to, that odd foreign tune, wasn’t playing on the third floor when I opened the door. There was no sound at all; the only thing I could hear was my own heartbeat. But, in what I assumed was some system malfunction, the music started randomly, and was loud, much louder than downstairs. Too loud, to be frank, but just like in the rest of this building, I had no idea how to turn it off. The speakers had no buttons, and I never found a stereo system connected to them.



It was hard, that first step. Every instinct in my body told me to leave this floor alone, my mind conjuring every manner of horrific demon lying in wait for me. But it was all in my head; that’s what I told myself. So I took that first step, the thud of my foot drowned out by the booming music. I thought nothing on this floor could be worse than whatever it was I went through last night, and I took a few more. 



I made it to the second doorway, the one at the edge of the room containing the stairs and elevator. I was trying to decide where I wanted to go to try and find a light switch when the music turned back off. The air hung heavy, and without thinking about it, I held my breath. After a few bated seconds, I began to realize I was being stupid, just being a childish coward. I thought I was alone on this floor, but by some sort of miracle, those few seconds I waited might have saved my life. Just before I took my next step, I heard that same noise as before again. 



*Ssskkrrr…Click click clack…*



The sound of something being dragged, then the sound of something clicking and clacking together. This time, I was sure I hadn’t imagined it, and it came from only a few feet away, just barely out of sight in the darkness. 



I was still holding my breath, now acutely aware that I would need to gasp for air soon, but terrified to make a move. *Someone* was up here, or maybe *something* was. The silence was oppressive, not a feeling I was accustomed to anymore. 



*Skrrt..click…clack…click…*



The sound was just off to my right, maybe three or four feet at the most. But as the dragging sound came, so too did what was making it, just barely into the light coming from the stairway. A lumbering, disproportionate, and malformed shape came into the light, something that I thought *must* have been a figment of my imagination, but one I never could have imagined willfully.



The figure was humanoid but not human-looking. It had two legs, one normal, but one horribly long and disfigured, the thigh just as long as the other entire leg. Instead of two feet on the ground, it walked with one foot and one knee on the ground, the remainder of its long leg dragging on the floor behind it as it lumbered forward. One of its arms had no elbow, its upper and lower arm fused into one, with a curled claw-like hand at the end. Its other arm had two elbows facing opposite directions, its hand reaching a few inches above the floor. Its mouth twitched open and shut, or rather *her* mouth twitched open and shut, teeth gnashing. She was the spitting image of my mother. 



*Sskkerrt…Click click…*



She shifted forward, moving parallel to the doorway I stood inside. Just like my mother, one side of her face was pulled back tight, her other side drooped down and hanging a quarter inch open. She was wearing a dirty blue hospital gown, the bottom coming down to just above her good knee. Pink flowers on it were just barely visible as she stood on the edge of the light. 



Just as soon as she lurched into my sight, she took another step with her good leg, taking herself once more out of the light. The last sight I saw of her was her foot dragging after her into the darkness.



*Sskrrett…Click Clack…*



Just as the pain in my chest began to scrape at my mind, the loud music started once more. It startled me and drew a sharp, surprised gasp of air in. I took a few more, managing to catch my breath. I decided standing there that as soon as I could find the motivation to move my feet, I would go back downstairs and promptly learn where the light switches were. With my eyes held as wide open as I could, I took a step backward, refusing to turn my back on the abyss of the third floor. I saw no movement; the only sound I could hear was the loud music. 



Almost in reverse of getting here onto the floor, getting back out seemed to require the same willpower. That first step was hard, every instinct in my body telling me that if I moved, whatever's there would see me, my mind conjuring every which manner that creature could lurch out and kill me. But after the first step, I took another, then a third, and after the fourth, I was in front of the stairway door again.



I quietly fumbled behind myself for the handle and managed to turn it smoothly without looking. I opened it, and once more, the loud music stopped.



*Sskkkrrrt…. Click….clack…*



The sound came from further away into the dark, close to where I imagined the nurse's desk was. I sighed a short breath of relief and stepped through the doorway. The clap of my footsteps reverberated within the stairway, the sound spilling out past the doorway I held open. I didn't think of it when I took the step, but as soon as my foot landed I knew I had made a mistake. The sound of the dragging came again behind me, this time in rapid succession, and headed straight towards me. 



I leapt through the door, slamming it shut behind me and falling flat on my butt, my breath became rapid and haggard. My hands slapped on the ground as I tried to scramble onto my feet, but the noise was overshadowed by the sound coming through the closed door. Whatever slow lumbering the figure had before turned into an awkward sprint, the clicking of the teeth drowned out but heavy, rapid footsteps. 



*Sskkkrrt, skrrt, skrrt…thud…thud, skrrt…….BOOOOMM*



A brief moment of silence was broken by the door rattling on its hinges as the hulking figure slammed itself against it. Pressed clear against the glass doorlight was my mother's face. I waited for it to come through, for it to kill me, but the handle didn't move, nor did it slam against the door again. She, it, whatever, just stayed pressed against the door. 



The glass fogged up from its breath, the dampened, quiet sound of teeth gnashing the only sound I could hear besides my pounding heart. I shakily rose to my feet, unable to take my eyes away as I took a closer look at the face. Right down to the crow's feet beside her eyes, from her dark brown hair to the scar on her nose, this was my mother. I watched her like she was an animal in a cage, waiting to see what she would do next. 



*Click…click….clack…click*



She clacked her jaw up and down, each time opening her mouth a little bit wider. I noticed something strange about how she was doing it, too. I even opened my own mouth to check, and just as I thought, only my bottom jaw moved. The top of my mom's head moved just as much as her bottom jaw, tilting back as she opened it until eventually, the top of her head lay perpendicular to her neck. Her bottom jaw reached past the center of her throat. The red flesh inside her throat bulged out, sticking an inch or so above her yellow teeth.



The glass in front of her began to fog up fiercely, like she was breathing a great big breath onto it, or maybe it was more like she was screaming. I didn't hear anything, but I felt it deep in my body. My bones shook, my knees turned to jelly, and just behind my eyes, I felt the rumbling of an intense migraine. I stepped backward, down the first step of the stairway with a shaky leg. I heard no sound, but the feeling was identical to the time in the employee lounge yesterday, to that terrible horn I heard. After just a few seconds the initial rumbling of a migraine turned into what I could only describe as skull-splitting. 



I clamped my hands on my ears as my legs gave out underneath me. I tumbled down the flight of stairs, rolling onto the platform halfway between the second and third floors. Her face was out of sight, but I could still feel it on that glass door. Somehow, I could almost smell its rancid breath in the room. I crawled further, desperate to gain more distance between us, and crested over the first step of the next flight. I tumbled down that too, any pain in my body drowned out by the overwhelming agony in my head. 



The door leading back to the second floor was right in front of me, looking blurry as my eyes began to water. I tried to call out for help, even though I knew no one could come; I could barely manage a whimper, much less a scream. My voice came out strained and painful, my throat feeling dry and sickly. I thought I would die on that floor, my skull would split open and spill my thoughts out onto the tiles, and my memories would seep into the grout. 



The pain persisted, but by some will of God, I managed to rise onto my feet. I hunched over, one hand on my head, one managing to fumble the handle and make my way through back onto the second floor. Like a child under their blanket I felt safer here, as if whatever cruel entity was above me couldn't touch me here. Greeted by the sound of the music I strangely felt a little better already, even if only a little.



I crumpled down, resting against the door to the stairs. I felt like I was in desperate need of something, but I wasn't sure what. Maybe water for my dry throat, maybe some of the medicine to ease my pain, or maybe I just wanted to go watch a movie with my mother; to pretend nothing about our lives had changed. 



I needed a moment to collect my thoughts, to piece back together my mind. I shut my eyes and began to think, trying to imagine what to do next, running through all my problems in my head. 



The medicine for the residents was running out, and I couldn't get more. Morphine for my mom only had maybe a day or two left at most, if she used it sparingly. No fresh food was left, just dry goods sparse in nutrients, and sauce packets most residents couldn't eat anyway. I didn't know how much longer the electricity and water would stay on, and it was only another month until it started getting cold outside. I was in over my head, and to top it off, something was wrong with me, something that could be possibly deadly. If I died, what use would trying to help the residents be anyway? They’d be alone without me.



If you’re somehow reading this, this is going to sound insane to you; whether what I saw upstairs was all in my head or not honestly doesn't matter, horrifying as it was. I was already overwhelmed; anything on top of it just felt like pouring more water into an already overflowing cup. As long as it kept to its own floor, that is. 



Sitting on the cold tiles, the visage of my mother's warped open maw clear in my head, I thought up a horrible idea. Try as hard as I may, I didn't stay just for the other residents. I didn't ignore my family's wishes to go with them for the other residents. I'm not already, as I write this, considering going back to the third floor for the other residents. I stayed here to be with my mom. If I killed the remaining eight people in this building, that would fix some of my problems.



Not all of them, I’ll admit, but an unfortunate reality is that they all were destined to die from the very beginning. I’ve just postponed their fate, and if it means postponing my mother's just a little bit more, then it’s an option I need to consider. It would be a hard task; everyone here is so friendly and kind, but maybe it’s all the more reason not to try to prolong their life. Maybe it would be better for them to die by my hands, happy and with a friend, than to waste away on their own, alone and afraid. 



This would leave the remaining food and medicine just for me and my mom, turning two weeks of supplies to possibly two months. The water and electricity were outside of my control, so I tried not to worry about that. That left the morphine for my mom. Her body was in constant pain, and every day the doses she needed to numb it grew larger. But there is a place I know with absolute certainty had more: the hospice section of the third floor. The question is, am I willing to go back for her?



I’m not sure how long I was thinking of all this, but I’m sure I was on the floor for a long time. With my eyes shut, palms pressed firmly to my eyes, my headache eventually began to dim. I didn’t hear any noise from the stairway that could imply whatever was above me tried to get down. Whether I decided to take the lives of the residents here or not, I still had work to do. So I opened my eyes, and they were greeted by an ocean of greys, greens, and white. I was looking directly into another pair of eyes, hovering just a few inches from my face. 



I don’t know how, or for how long, but Mrs. Dawson had crept up in front of me, knelt down on two knees, and lowered her face down in front of mine to watch me. Her lips were slightly parted and moving rapidly, like she was mouthing words but not making noise. 



“Mrs…Dawson? Are you okay? Do you nee-”



“Hallowed be thy name.” She interjected. It came out hushed and fast, almost incomprehensible. “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done…” She pressed her face even closer, her cold forehead touching mine. Her skin was so cool and dry it felt as if she was wearing a mask made of paper mache.



“It’s dangerous here, ma’am,” I said, but my voice was quiet and meek. The elevator shaft to my side was still just a few feet away, but with her face pressed against mine, the distance felt like mere inches. Slowly, Mrs. Dawson raised both of her hands up to my face, grasping it on either side.



“...On earth as it is in heaven.” She whispered, her voice coming from deep in her chest, like all of the air in her lungs escaped her as she said it. “Johnny is up there, you just didn’t see him.” 



At the mention of the name Johnny, the tips of my fingers began to tingle and grow numb, and I felt a dull ringing in my ears. I raised my hands to grip her wrists firmly, my brow beginning to furrow.



“Get the hell off me,” I responded coldly, “Before I move you.” 



Her fingernails dug into my skin, and she pressed her face even closer to mine, her mouth barely an inch away. She ignored my demand and resumed her prayer. 



“Give us this day our daily bread!” Mrs. Dawson spoke louder, her eyes more lucid than I had ever seen them before. “ And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us!” 



I squeezed my hands hard around her wrists, more desperate to get her off of me than I was to not hurt her. Her face contorted in pain, and her mouth opened wide as if she was about to scream, but no sound came. Instead, as I got myself up onto one knee, she stretched her mouth as wide as she could open it and exhaled as much breath as she could hold in her lungs. Her breath came out hot, and reeked of fake maple syrup.



I moved her hands away from my face, anger beginning to boil in my gut. Her arms shook as she tried to fight me, but her frail frame had long lost its strength. I got my other foot underneath me and began to stand. Mrs. Dawson kept her face level with mine, raising it as I stood up. Despite my warning, she continued to yell at me. 



“And lead us not into temptation!” Spit flew from her mouth as she shouted, bespeckling my face. I shoved her to the side as hard as I could, frantically trying to get her away from me. She landed on the ground hard; an audible crack could be heard as her feeble body smacked against the tiles.



She took a moment to try and suck in a breath, to regain her voice, and as she did she leaned her body on one of her shaky arms. With her other she dragged herself backwards, away from me and directly towards the elevator shaft. I balled up my fists in anger, but I didn't speak.



I didn't say a word. I stood there, staring at her attempting to put distance between us. She moved at a snails pace, her arms carrying her a few inches at a time. I had plenty of time to stop her, I could have lifted her up and carried her away. She couldn't have weight more than 90 pounds. I made no effort; instead I watched her draw closer to the drop, trying to catch her breath before she eventually found her voice once more. 



“But deliver us-” her voice cut as she fell down the open elevator shaft. She didn't scream as she fell; there was a brief moment of silence followed by a sickening thud and a wet crunch. The impact sounded like hitting a wet, dead tree with a hammer. 



It felt like time had stopped as I stood there, unmoving. After the sound of her hitting the bottom, a small and almost gentle noise rose from the floor beneath. Mrs. Dawson had survived the drop, and she began to cry. My legs carried me against my will and took me to the inky mess leading below. 



A faint glimmer of light from above wafted down the elevator shaft, where I could see her silhouette lying at the bottom. Her body was twisted and contorted into a macabre ballerina's pose, both her legs intertwined and limp. One arm rested over her head, and the other lay on her stomach. At the sight of me, she raised that arm shakily and spoke to me again.



“Please, dear, won't you help me?” She said, almost too quietly for me to hear. “I can still hear him crying… I don't think he ever stopped…” I turned my back on her and left the room, too weak to watch her die.



My anger stopped me from acting, but now it was too late for my regret to help her. Looking at her dying, I wasn't even angry anymore; I just felt sad. So I did the same thing I used to do when I was a kid, when everything felt too important to do, all together, and all at the same time. Instead of trying to do everything, I chose to do nothing. 



I spent the rest of the day ignoring all my responsibilities and shutting myself in my mother's room. I read her a few chapters of a book, we watched a movie, and eventually I leaned my head on her arm and drifted off for an early night's rest. 



I'm not sure why Mrs. Dawson mentioned Johnny. For all I know, my mind had finally snapped, and I imagined the whole thing. Maybe I just watched an innocent woman die, or perhaps the visage of my mother I saw wasn't the only thing up there. I wouldn't have believed it if she hadn't mentioned him by name, but perhaps my little brother is up there, too. 



I'm writing this the next morning, bright and early. Today, I plan on killing the remaining seven residents, and after some brief preparations, I'll be returning to the third floor once more.
