It all began when my parents jetted off to a fancy soirée across the pond; the kind of party a person needs a golden ticket to attend. To this minute, I still don’t know what made the two of them special enough to rub shoulders with Armani suits and B-list actresses, but before I could blink they were eating beef bourguignon on the plane while I stayed at home to feed the cat and drown in jealousy. Perhaps, I thought, they might return with an air of superiority, maybe a red-wine-fueled story or two. What I didn’t expect them to return with, was bloodlust. 

  
It would have been easy to miss the dark glint in my mother’s eye when she returned, but as she often told me with a wry smile, I’m *perceptive*. So, perceptive I was when I began to notice icy eyes on me every time I entered a room, steely gazes burning holes in my skin. I would walk into the kitchen and my parents would suddenly hush, an eerie silence falling over us as they jerked their necks to glare at me. The smiles would fall off their faces, eyes growing beady and cold. The air prickled at my skin and I swore the life got sucked from the room every time I dared enter it.

  
My parents and I had never been particularly close, but I’d been making an effort recently. My mother was always a little distant, my father a little stoic, but I was trying. *Walls*, my therapist told me, but these were not walls. It was not *walls* when I awoke in the night to see my door slightly ajar, a pair of eyes glaring at me from the crack of light in the hall. It was not *walls* when my sister hooked an eyebrow, asking me why Dad kept following me around the house, keeping to the darkness. I convinced myself paranoid, but I walked around that tomb with goosebumps every minute of the day, always feeling as though I was an animal and they were spectating me, waiting to snatch me up and tear the flesh from my bones. Each string of words that left their mouths grew odder by the day, no less when my mother grabbed my wrist one morning, asking sweetly if I could try to compact myself to see if I could fit in the oven. *I just want to see what can be cooked in there*, she said with a white-knuckled grip, absent-mindedly licking her lips.

  
The first time I began to fear for my life was four days after they touched down. I’d returned home to see them both standing in the garden, heads turning eerily slowly to watch me as I trudged up the lawn. I couldn’t shake the feeling they’d been standing out there for hours in the elements, rigid and swaying as they waited for me to return.

  
“Come for a trip,” my mother barked, an empty smile refusing to reach her eyes. When I stopped dead in my tracks, my father nodded and pointed to the car.

  
“It’ll be fun,” he assured me, already grabbing his keys and marching towards the vehicle. They shared a secret glance and I ignored every sense screaming for me to go inside and leave them standing here in their robotic trance. But the desperation of wanting them to show me any semblance of warmth won, and I followed them, embarrassingly eager.

  
“Where to?” I asked keenly, and I realise now that the awkward silence that followed was born from the insidious thoughts bouncing around their heads as they looked at me hungrily, an awful excitement lining their features. They didn’t reply, but when my mother stopped in her tracks and whirled around, I did too. Her expression was positively gleeful.

  
“Check the back tyre,” she monotoned, hand stabbing at the air, “I think there’s a puncture.”

  
Her arm hovered uselessly and I followed her finger, brows furrowed. “The tyre?” I echoed, confused. She nodded, lips twitching. Her gaze never left me when I made the slow walk as commanded, glancing down at the object of her interest. Honestly, I barely even looked and nodded, quietly murmuring that it was fine. My stomach sank as her smile contorted into a scowl, pure animosity scorching me.

  
“Get down there,” she muttered, grinding her teeth. I wish I could convey the atmosphere in that moment but it bordered on horrifying, the way she was looking at me as though she was ready to lunge at me the second I glanced away. It was relief, though, that flooded my body as I watched her face light up again, precisely as I lowered myself - slowly - to the floor. I held my breath as my knees hit the ground, gingerly running a finger over the tyre.

  
“I don’t think-”

  
But I needn’t have bothered. No sooner had the air left my lungs than the car roared to life, surging backwards ferociously. I’m sure a scream ripped from my body because I heard it echoing around me for days, but it was a blur as I threw myself backwards, unable to fully scramble away from the onslaught of the car. It didn’t crush my organs, didn’t drag me under, because only a stray foot jammed under the wheel as pain exploded and I fought the urge to pass out.

  
I don’t remember much. It was a haze of agony, fear and confusion, but one thing I do recall is locking eyes with my mother, gasping at the deflated, despondent look she aimed at me. But no sooner had it existed than it was replaced, her mouth dropping open as she leapt into action.

  
I ended up in bed, trembling and staring at the patterns on my ceiling. Snapshots of memories tell me my mother had taken me there, arms wrapped around me protectively as I was delivered to my bed, a place I was too fearful to leave for ten hours. I remember my father’s voice, booming as I was lifted clumsily up the stairs.  


  
*“I don’t know what happened! The car - one minute we were still, the next it had gotten away from me…”*

  
So I lay. I replayed the scene over and over, telling myself that paranoia was washing over me and it was unjustified. Stupid. No, my parents were not *trying to run me over*. They weren’t trying to knock me onto my back and surge a car over my body, crushing my organs and stealing my life away. Yes, they were acting downright fucking *odd*, but Christ, maybe they were just jet-lagged to a comical degree.

  
It was fine. Everything was fine.

  
Fine, until three days later. I’d limped around the house in somewhat of a haze, always watching over my shoulder. Sometimes I’d see eyes in the shadows I pretended weren’t there, but sometimes it was fine. Totally fine. Sure, I did find that ridiculously sharp bit of plastic jammed into my mashed potato, but it was from a packet. These things happen. It wasn’t quite as damning as later that evening when my father decided then was the time to start up the wood chipper.

  
It wasn’t his - he’d hired workers to destroy a bulk of the trees smattering around our house and by rights, it wasn’t his to use. I wasn’t even sure how he’d started the damn thing which is why my sister and I padded out after him, Bryn screwing her face up in confusion. 

“He’s stolen the keys to joyride a fucking wood chipper.”

  
But he was in fact swaying alongside it and heaving bits of tree into the contraption, watching as it sailed off above him in explosions of oaky brown. Majestic, if he hadn’t gestured for us to come closer, a frenzied glint in his eye visible even under the dim moonlight. We both padded over but he shook his head, finger stabbing towards me.

  
“No. *Just you*.”

  
I did it. I’ll never know why but I dragged my feet, standing alongside him as he heaved branches into my arms, eyes never leaving mine as he nodded his head towards the huge, horrifying opening with its waiting jaws. I refused to get close but I was fine, doing my bit and witnessing these trees transform into a thousand little pieces of uselessness. Still, the unnerving coldness that swept over us felt like a weight heaving down on my shoulders. With each grind of the gears, my stomach twisted and my limbs began to shake, as if my body knew something my mind did not. I knew his eyes never left the back of my head. I knew he was watching me. Waiting.

  
I just didn’t expect it when he shoved me in.

  
I’ve never felt such fear, ice exploding around my veins as I sucked in my last breath, body clattering painfully next to the churning metal waiting to crunch my bones to mulch. It was sucking me in and I was going to die, the deafening noise ready to split me into a billion atoms and water the lawn with my blood, but it didn’t. It didn’t because a miracle grabbed my legs and yanked me back with such force that I tore my arms and we tumbled to the ground in a mess of limbs and hair, both screaming enough for my silent father who only looked down at me with quiet disdain.

  
Another blur of minutes melting together. Laying on the wet grass panting, my sister clutching and rocking me as my Dad turned his back and walked inside too slowly, as though I hadn’t almost been torn limb from limb. She trembled more than I did, eyes blown and impossibly wide as I finally met them with my unsteady gaze. When she spoke, her voice barely reached a tortured whisper.

  
“He pushed you in. *He fucking pushed you in*.”

  
When we staggered back inside, she insisted she’d call the police but I begged her to wait. We stumbled up to her room and I simply couldn’t stop staring at the window, wondering how close it came to being painted with my insides. I dared find the strength in my shaking legs to drag myself into my father’s study, Bryn pleading with me to stop and call the damn police every minute that passed. She kept a reluctant watch as I flicked the light on, padding barefoot around his room and desperate to find anything.

  
And oh, I found it.  


  
Shelves. Shelves of rat poison, antifreeze, arsenic. Rows of awful-looking curved knives, ropes, pill bottles. It all sent such a stab to my stomach that I almost doubled over. But that wasn’t the damning part, because his computer was right there. Back when he wasn’t possessed by hell itself, he’d muttered his password to me *in case anything ever happened* to him. Something *had* happened to him and so I logged on, heading straight for his email and searching from the date of his fucked up brunch with the devil which by all accounts, had turned him into a bit of a fucking psycho. I thought maybe he’d been possessed by demons, gotten himself wrapped up in the paranormal.

  
But no, it was worse. He was my Dad. He just didn’t want to have a daughter anymore.

  
Because his upper-class party was not a tasteful dinner for those invited, but a sequined blood oath binding them all to one another in a promise of eternal life and greatness. They would abide by the rules and by one another, a single commandment sticking out to me in glorious technicolour, sending my stomach to my shoes.

  
**Thou must be childless.**

  
They knew he wasn’t. I was sure of this because the anatomy of a human girl was clearly laid out in picture form in the following email, with lines jaggedly sketched in suggestion of where to draw ‘**gallons of blood**’ from. The picture, in clumsy scrawl, had my name written above it.

  
The instructions to my parents were clear. They would consume the blood of the first child, then smear it on the face of the second - before sacrificing her to the cult for all eternity, as an offering to the lord who opened his arms to them. The blood of their first child would be drained, and the soul of their second would prosper in hell.

  
I imagined my father crawling around the floor of the wood chipper, gathering up bits of me and draining them of my blood, only to hold Bryn’s head steady and paint her with her older sister on her tortured canvas. They had gone mad. Signed their life away to a group of deranged lunatics who probably watched us from the shadows, promising to gut their only daughters and offer themselves up to their new unholy god.

  
I didn’t read anymore. I ran, actually. Grabbed Bryn’s hand and wrenched the window open, knowing whatever was out there was infinitely less horrifying than what lived with us at home. We ran, and they follow us. It’s never clear, but sometimes, when I gaze out the window of a run-down hotel, I see the frizz of my mother’s hair sticking out from behind a gnarled tree in the distant dark. When I succumb to my paranoia that somebody at the train station has been watching me the entire journey, I see my father’s watchful eyes peering at me over the day-old paper in his grasp.

&#x200B;

They get closer every day. I smell my Mum's perfume when I lay in bed, clutching foreign bedcovers for dear life. I hear the jingle of my father's keys, stomach turning at a noise that once brought nothing but comfort. Now, I watch my numbered days dwindle and know that Bryn and I have to split up, because then, perhaps one of us lives. All stories should be told and mine is hurtling towards the end - I don't know how it hits its climax. I just know that from the balcony of this room, I see a couple in the car park, staring right up at me with deranged smiles on their pale faces.

&#x200B;

They're here.
