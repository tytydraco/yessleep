I would be lying if I said I haven’t accidentally ingested a Category 10 hippocampus mixed into a banana smoothie.

Two weeks ago, I was as naïve as I was stupid. I was also in a fuck load of denial.

My college campus was bustling with students passing by me in a blur of white noise, but my reality didn’t feel real. I had spent most of the night bent over my toilet bowl bringing up my stomach lining in an attempt to get rid of whatever the fuck I had ingested in that [milkshake](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/155y9as/i_got_a_job_as_a_runner_for_an_ice_cream_store_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2). It had taken me hours gargling on mouthwash to get the tangy, poisonous taste of dishwasher soap out of my mouth. But even then, I didn’t care about possibly getting my stomach pumped or making myself seriously ill.

 I couldn’t get what I had seen out of my head. Names. Expiry dates. Not for ice cream. For humans. 

The word “REMOVED” still felt prominent in my skull like a physical thing. These kids were not our customers, and my job wasn’t to chase up people who weren’t paying their debts to this store. No. I was kidnapping what my colleagues called Buggie's and unknowingly bringing these kids to the slaughter. 

But what was the slaughter? 

What was being removed? I knew at the back of my thoughts exactly what was being removed, and what Grand Court House was—but I was in denial. 

It was just a dorm room, right? 

That’s what I was told. It was a dorm room for kids who couldn’t afford proper student accommodation. 

But even after going there myself and hunting down my first Buggie, the place reminded me more of an orphanage. Farm. That’s what my first and only Buggie had told me before they dragged him away to a fate I still wasn’t sure of. I wanted to believe Nathanial was okay, but according to the notes I’d found, he was scheduled for removal the night prior. 

There was no doubt in my mind that Nathanial wasn’t special in some way. I had seen him dive off of a fourth-floor stairwell and land on his toes like a cat.  I saw him disappear and then reappear through a glittering blue light swimming in the air—something I thought I was fucking imagining. 

I was starting to join up the dots in my head—and yeah, I hadn’t slept and was running on five or six cups of coffee, but I knew one thing for sure. 

Nathanial Mycroft had been kidnapped and possibly murdered for whatever power he had—and was being sold to middle-aged moms for their children. How many others had ended up like Nathanial? 

How many Buggie’s had these people killed?  Dylan and Violet were in on whatever this was—were they under some kind of control, or being blackmailed? 

The two of them were addicted to the milkshakes, which made me wonder if the shakes were what sealed their mouths shut. But not just that. There was something about Dylan that was almost as otherworldly as Nathanial, especially with the way my colleague had captured the boy, seemingly controlling the kid with a simple glance. Was he a Buggie? 

And if he was, why was he working for the people killing and harvesting his friends? The questions wouldn’t stop, drowning me, as I waited in baited silence for the woman on the other end of the line to answer. I had been stewing in my own thoughts for a little over two minutes. I don’t even know how I dragged myself to classes. I don’t know how I got out of bed and forced down a cereal bar and black coffee. 

It’s like my thoughts were on autopilot, mindlessly trudging through my usual routine. I had to repeat a whole semester in a summer-school-type program, after failing the previous one, so it’s not like I had a choice whether I went to classes or not. “I’m sorry, Miss, can you repeat that?” The woman’s voice crackled down the phone, slicing through my thoughts. “Your work is kidnapping college students with superpowers and harvesting their brains to put in their ice cream.” She spoke in a patient tone, but I could tell this woman was seconds from cutting the call. 

I chewed my lip, reveling in the air-con. I hated southern summers. The thick, overbearing humidity made my skin crawl. “Well, I don’t know if they’re *superpowers*,” I said, panicking. 

I thought back to the night before when Nathanial disappeared right in front of me and then popped back into existence several feet away, as well as the hovering college guys hanging out in the reception area. Now that I was thinking about it, if this place was for kids with these abilities, and it was a farm like Nathanial told me, why did it look like that? If it was a farm, wouldn’t these kids be locked up and forced together like cattle? 

Swallowing my urge to spout all of this to the cop, I chose my words carefully. “I know I sound crazy,” I whispered. “But these kids aren’t normal. I saw a guy jump off of a fourth-floor stairwell and land on his feet—"

“Ma'am, did you know it is a criminal offence to prank the emergency services?” Her voice cut through mine, finally snapping at me. I was actually surprised I’d held her attention that long. She seemed wary about the kidnapping part, but when I started talking about nineteen-year-olds hovering in the air, and brain-flavored milkshakes, I lost her.  

“Wait,” I said. “Can you at least send someone to Grand Court House? I think those kids are in danger.”

“Ma’am, that place does not exist. I have the address you gave me on my screen right now. If you’re talking about the old school building, the building has been abandoned since 1972 and is under 24-hour surveillance.” Her words sent shivers prickling down my spine, and I felt my legs start to give way. 

“Is there anything else you want to tell me or are you finished?” she said. “As I said, young lady, prank-calling the emergency services is illegal. If you continue to make these outlandish claims, I will be forced to pursue standardized action. Have a nice day.” 

This time, she slammed the phone down before I could conjure words in my mouth. I don’t remember what I did after that. I found myself in a daze, my classes a blur of white noise and color. Grand Court House had been abandoned since 1972. But I had been to that place the night before—and it was clearly open as a student dorm. Was the woman lying, or was I going fucking crazy? 

I remembered exactly what the place looked like; a large building with ivy crawling up the walls and bars on the windows. Something sour crept up my throat. Was it possible that my perception had been screwed with? 

It was lunchtime when color started to bleed back into my reality, dragging me from cotton candy thoughts. I was frowning at the meat in my deli sandwich, my stomach dancing, when a cafeteria tray slammed down on my table, followed suit by its owner. 

"You are walking around like a zombie," Jun said, slumping down opposite me. Jun was the explosion of ADHD I needed to pluck me from my own mind. 

I met him in my freshman year, and since then we had been inseparable. Jun Sutton was half Korean on his mother’s side, and the human embodiment of a golden retriever, looks and personality-wise. He picked up my half-eaten brownie and took a bite, spraying crumbs everywhere. 

"What's up?"  

Like me, Jun was also behind in his classes and was using his summer to catch up.

Instead of expressing my own woes he most likely wouldn’t understand, I pointed out his dishevelled state. “Did you just roll out of bed?”

Jun’s lips quirked into a grin. He ran one hand through his mess of bedraggled brown curls usually tamed by his hood. “Maybe.”

“I can tell."

“I was studying most of the night,” He plonked down a grey flask and took a sip. “And this is what’s been keeping me going. It’s literally rewiring my brain.”

I raised a brow. “What is it?”

“It’s a secret.”

“Jun.”

“Addie.” Jun mocked my voice. When I reached over to hit him, he rolled his eyes. “It’s just an energy drink I bought from someone.” His expression soured a little. “I can’t concentrate on anything usually, and one sip of this gets me all the way through the night. None stop studying. I didn’t check my phone once last night."

When I didn’t give a good enough response,  my head in the clouds, he leaned toward me with a sparkle in his eyes. Jun was right about the drink rewiring his brain. Normally, he couldn’t even look me in the eye without getting distracted by a fly on the window. He couldn’t hold a stable conversation without going on a tangent, and yet so far had managed to not just look me in the eye, but easily ooze his way through two separate conversations without bringing up twenty different topics. I saw it has his charm. Jun was a sweetheart, and his manic rambling was why I loved him. 

Now, though, he wasn’t knocking his feet into mine or tapping his fingers on the table. His usually wandering eyes were too still. Too normal. When he’d sat down, my friend had been his usual hyperactive self, though as time had passed, I had failed to notice the explosion I was used to was slowly fading away. 

Whatever this energy drink was, it wasn’t just helping him concentrate, it was slowing him down, molding him into the opposite of what he usually was. With perfect posture replacing his slumped-over demeanor, my best friend almost resembled a different person. But when I fully took him in, I started to realize something was different about him. He wasn’t blinking. 

I waited for it because usually, Jun blinked several times a minute. 

Now his facial expression was completely still, frozen on a wide smile. He picked up his flask and took another long sip, exhaling a happy sigh. “What are you doing tonight? Didn’t you say on Instagram you had a new job?"

I swallowed my sandwich with a pit in my stomach. “I quit… I think.”

“You think? Didn’t you only work there for one night?”

Turning my attention to my half-eaten lunch, my gut twisted at the thought of eating meat. I was still thinking of the word “removal” and what exactly it meant. If it meant what I thought, then Nathanial Mycroft was dead.  

Thinking back to what I had read on the notes, there were names, expiration dates, and categories for all of them, but Nathanial had been TBD. And what were these kids being categorized as? 

The more I thought about it, the sicker I felt. I shoved my tray away, swallowing thickly. “It’s complicated,” I said, and when Jun raised a brow, intrigued, I forced a smile.

Jun inclined his head, a stray curl falling in his eyes. “Did your colleagues suck?”

I thought back to the night prior when Dylan had been talking to himself the whole van ride as if I wouldn’t notice. His almost feral obsession with the milkshakes was just the ironic icing on top, and Violet was self-explanatory. “Something like that.”

Jun finished off the brownie, speaking through a mouthful. I winced when a spray of chocolate crumbs hit me in the face.  “Gweat! I’ll twake thmath as you’ve quimf!” He swallowed. 

“We can celebrate your one day of employment by hanging out, and we still need to binge-watch Lost. I’m not working tomorrow, and my classes are done for the week.” He pulled out his phone, glancing at the screen. “I need to call my mom before classes start so I’ll see ya later, okay?” His expression softened. “Addie, I know something is wrong, so we’re going to talk it out, kay? I’ll even bring beer and snacks.” 

Before I could answer, he jumped up and grabbed his backpack, stopping to zip it up before all of his books flew out. Usually, Jun let it hang open, strolling down the hallway with his headphones corked in, completely oblivious to his textbooks falling out one by one.

“I’m probably going to sleep early.”

“Addie.”

“What?”

“What’s going on?” His expression crumpled. “You’ve been walking around like the living dead all day, and it’s like… the lights are on but nobody’s home.” He knocked on my head as a joke, and quickly backed away when I shot him the warning eyes.

I held his gaze. “Remember when I told you I did track at high school?”

“Yeah, you won bronze.”

“Well, my work hired me as a runner,” I said. “Which is like… an ice-cream bailiff. I have to bring these kids in who haven’t been paying.”

His expression twisted with confusion. “I don’t like where this is going.”

“You won’t,” I said with a breathy laugh bridging on a sob. “I know it sounds crazy, but I think my boss and colleagues are—"

“Yo, Jun!”

Jun’s ears pricked. Someone was shouting his name across the cafeteria, and for a moment he ignored it before shooting me a reassuring smile. It was comforting. Everything about him was comforting, right down to his ratty backpack and unevenly buttoned shirt. 

“Tell me about it later, okay? I’ll text you in class, and don’t bother running away because I will stalk you and follow you home.” He shot me a two-fingered salute before hurrying to catch up with a group of friends waiting for him, and I was left trying to conjure the word “killing” in my throat which had died halfway through attempting it. 

It’s not like I didn’t want to hang with him—in fact, he would have been the perfect distraction. But I was also dealing with colleagues who were potential murderers. I wanted to save Nathanial, but was there anything left of him to save? The last thing I wanted was to drag someone else into this world but Jun was very... persuasive. 

I thought he was joking about the “stalking and follow you home” thing, but the second I dragged myself out of the library, there he was, leaning against the wall with his arms folded.

Seeing him, however, gave me an idea.

“Can you do me a favor?”

He joined my side in a wonky walk as usual. Clearly, the concentration drink had worn off. “It depends on what it is.” He shot me the side-eye. “So, when were you planning on telling me your job was literally kidnapping broke college kids for not paying for pricey ice cream?”

“Never.”

I told Jun half of the truth. 

I was going back to work to grab my things and officially quit. I just needed him to distract my colleagues while I slipped into the back to try and find the poor Buggie. 

When I dragged him into Moo-Moo Brain Desserts, however, he stiffened up. “This place?” He hissed, leaning into me. There was a long queue of mostly women and children, and I could glimpse Violet working at the counter. Jun didn’t even try to keep his voice down. 

“Dude, do you even know the rumor about this place? The prices are crazy! It’s like almost ten dollars for mint chocolate chip,” He whispered, as my gaze followed Violet flitting around making ice-cream cones with her signature smile. I couldn’t see Dylan, which wasn’t good. Was he in the back with Nathanial?  The store itself looked bright and colorful, and I was grateful for the air con blasting the sticky summer heat from my skin. 

When I was sure Violet hadn’t seen me, I turned to my friend.

“Do you see the girl with the dark hair?” I said under my breath.

Jun followed my gaze, nodding. “She’s the only girl working, so yeah.” It took him maybe half a second to understand my intentions.

“Oh, god, no."

“I know it sounds bad,” I started to say, only for him to cut me off with a whine.

“I’m not into girls, Addie.”

“She doesn’t know that!” I said, fixing up his collar and smoothing down his shirt. When he tried to shoo my hands away, I ignored him, reaching forward to attempt to tame unruly hair. “You’re an attractive man. Just make conversation with her.”

“About what?!” He whisper-shrieked. “Wait, why do I need to distract her? Don’t you work here?”

“I do, but I want to slip into the back without them noticing,” I patted him on the head. “I only need five minutes. I’m just grabbing my stuff.”

He groaned, tipping his head back. “What do I get for it?”

“What?”

“Payment.” Jun folded his arms, his lips curling. “You want me to flirt with your colleague. I’m not doing this for free.”

“Twenty dollars,” I said. “And I’ll binge Lost with you.”

He cocked a brow. “Twenty-five. We’re already doing the Lost binge.”

“Done.” I nodded for him to join the queue, and he reluctantly side-stepped next to an old woman. “Remember to keep her busy, okay?”

I didn’t hear his answer as I darted to the back of the store where I had first been interviewed. Before I opened the door, I turned back to where Jun was standing in line, tapping his feet, his gaze glued to his phone. He looked up as if he could sense me watching him and shot me a grin. “Go!” He mouthed, just as Violet did exactly what I knew she was going to do. Her eyes found Jun in the crowd, and ignoring the rest of the customers, she invited him to the front with a flirty smile and a jut of her chin. 

I didn’t blame her. Jun’s messy curls and disheveled state definitely stood out—but in a good way. I don’t know what it was; maybe his stripy backpack spilling books once again (I told you the drink wore off) or his shirt which was on inside out. 

Maybe it was just his face, which could be compared to a puppy dog, or his awkward smile when he dropped his phone. Her interest was piqued. 

When her lipsticky smile widened and she leaned forward, exposing as much cleavage as possible through her apron, I took that as an opportunity to pull open the door and slip into the back room. I don’t know what I was expecting, but a normal-looking breakroom with a wooden table surrounded by chairs wasn't it. This was the one room I was yet to see, and I thought it was their murder room.

That left the shady-looking door in Clayton’s office I’d first seen when coming for my initial interview. 

I was about to leave when a muffled voice caught me off guard. I turned to the source and glimpsed a door at the back of the room leading outside. It was open, and when I got closer, I could see an outline standing in the late afternoon sunlight. “You’re late, asshole.” Dylan was leaning against the wall, his lips curved around a cigarette. 

I noticed his hands were shaking trying to light it, his jacket clumsily flung over a bright pink apron. 

I thought he was talking to himself again before my gaze found a second figure standing several feet away. When the shadow stepped into the light, I caught a glimpse of his face, and I understood why my colleague was trembling. He was around Dylan’s age. Early twenties. 

In the late drenching sunlight, this guy looked almost inhuman; sunken eyes and pale cheeks, a grinning mouth with way too many teeth, inky dark hair slipping from his hood. It looked like might have once been attractive, but something had been sucked from him. 

I will never be able to describe this guy fully because there are no words in the English language to articulate what exactly I saw. I saw a man overshadowed by darkness, pooling oblivion which had taken him over in both his eyes and body; eyes which held no life or light, and an almost skeletal body, narrow hips his jeans were barely clinging onto and arms that were stick-thin. I would have thought it from drug use, but this was a whole different type of drug that had drained him dry of his life.

“And you’re smoking.” The guy’s voice was caught in a chuckle. “Dude, I thought you quit. Smoking is a bad habit, you know. I had an aunt who died of lung cancer because she chain-smoked fifty a day.” He took another step towards Dylan, and my colleague stayed frozen, the cigarette still hanging out of his mouth. 

This guy kept going, his steps slow and methodical. Even the way he moved was inhuman like the two of them were playing a chess game—and this guy was clearly the winner already, finally coming nose to nose with him. 

“Oooh, yeah. I forgot!” He laughed. “If you’re not lapping up your boy’s strawberry surprise, you start to go off the deep end.” His lips mocked a pout. “If Daley isn’t in your head 24/7 you start to wish we killed you too.” 

Folding his arms across his chest, this guy was in full control and knew it. Dylan didn’t appear fazed in his expression, but his fingers flicking ash were shaking. “How are the symptoms? I did tell you that going cold turkey will drive you mad.”

My colleague took a drag, exhaling a plume of smoke in his face. “Where is it?”

The stranger’s lips curved into a smirk. “Oh, wow. Straight to the point, huh? No, “Oh. Hey, Freddie, how are you doing? How’s life?”

“Hey, Freddie. How are you doing? How’s life.” Dylan deadpanned.

The guy, or Freddie, stepped back with a sigh. “Close enough,” he pulled something from his jacket pocket, a clear baggie filled with something. I could make out something sludgy and red clinging to the insides. Blood. But not just blood. I could see specks of white. 

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine, and my body told me to turn around and run. But I needed to know what they were doing—what was inside that bag, and Nathanial’s fate. 

Freddie swung the bag back and forth, spattering red slipping up and down the sides and pooling to the bottom. 

“I’m pretty sure I said I wanted a category 10 Buggie,” he murmured. “Literal gold dust, for the last pieces of your boy.” He over exaggerated looking around. “So, where is he?” 
His words pricked my mind. 

Could he be talking about Nathanial? 

I didn’t see his category, but according to the notes, he was the latest one scheduled for removal. The sight of the baggie made me sick. Was that what Buggies were reduced to?

“He’s inside.” Dylan grumbled. 

“So bring him outside,” Freddie’s voice was sing-song. “I didn’t come all the way here so you can fuck with my head.”

Dylan flicked away his cigarette and straightened up. “It’s not as easy as that, idiot. There’s a VIP who wants him, and she’s paying in the millions.”

“Duh.” Freddie’s lips quirked. “He’s a Cat 10. Those are fucking rare. I’m actually surprised the Buggie managed to hide it. Didn’t Clay send all the 10’s to the lovely 1%?” This time his laugh was manic. “Outsmarted by a Buggie. That’s kinda hilarious.”

Dylan’s expression didn’t falter. “What are you going to do with him?”

“What do you think I’m going to do, Einstein?”

“From the look on your face, I have a feeling it’s going to be cruel—and he’s going to wish you butchered him.”

“Didn’t you hear?” Freddie stepped back. “There’s a war going on. Buggie’s versus us. We made the mistake of creating them in the first place. The little shits are getting stronger and I need them if I’m going to take Clayton down,” his eyes darkened when Dylan scoffed. “I’m sorry, you’re judging me when you’re slicing their brains up and turning them into freakin’ sundaes?”

“You eat them raw,” my colleague murmured with a hint of disgust in his tone. “You fucking murder them and feast right from their skull.”

I was partially aware of my body moving back, a visceral reaction running through me, triggered by his words.

“They taste better,” the guy grinned. “I don’t need to grind them up and put them in dessert to make myself feel better.”

Dylan seemed to have the exact same reaction, his lips twisting into a grimace. Losing his cool, he started towards the boy, his body jolting. 

“You talk like I have a choice,” he spat. Before something seemed to come over his expression, his eyes softening. My colleague sighed, exhaling a breath. “I’ll get you the Buggie. Give me twenty minutes. Then you give me Rory.”

“Fifteen,” Freddie hummed. “If you fuck with me, your boy goes for a swim.” His eyes flashed. “There’s not much of him left anyway, but as long as you get your fix, right?”

Dylan’s expression crumpled, and I started to see flitters of emotion in his vastly crumbling façade. “You’re a monster.”

I took another step back, something slimy sticking to the back of my throat.

“At least I’ve made peace with it,” Freddie rolled his eyes. “Drop the self-righteous act, Eaton. You kill as many as I do. Acting human when you’re really not is pathetic. We’re the same, bro.” He cocked his head. “You’re worse! You don’t give a fuck about Buggies! All you care about is lapping up Daley’s remnants.  It’s been three years. When are you going to let him go?”

“I didn’t let him go,” Dylan gritted out. “You assholes murdered him.”

“No, we saved him,” the boy tipped his head back and sighed. “I’ve told you a thousand fucking times, your bro started all of this,” he straightened up, situating himself nose to nose with my colleague. “You weren’t the smart one, I get that,” he murmured. “Daley told us all about you. But. I’m sure even a dumb fuck like you can understand that this was all Daley’s idea.”

“You’re lying.” Dylan’s voice broke into a whisper.

“Am I? Why don’t you ask him the truth about the night you found him, huh? I think you guys need to talk it out because it looks like your boy ain’t being honest with ya.” Freddie spat in his face. “I wish you were smart enough so I could carve your brain right out of your skull—but alas, you’re not. Daley was one big shining fucking star, and you’re not even worth killing.”

Something twitched in Dylan’s face, and I realized he was just as monstrous as his friend. He was just better at hiding it, unlike his colleagues.

When the front of Freddie’s jacket burst into flames, I had to bite back a cry. I searched for a stray cigarette, but there was only Dylan’s glare piercing into him. He was the one controlling it, I could tell by the way the flames seemed to mimic his eye movements. 

I was right. My colleague was exactly like Nathanial, harboring abilities from a Buggie he had murdered and consumed. Freddie didn’t seem to mind the fire, easily wafting the blur of orange out with a chuckle. “Oh, wow, a category nine?” His lips split into a grin. 

“Which Buggie did you eat to get this? I thought you were just snacking on your boy, but you clearly have a craving for someone different, huh.” Freddie raised his arms. “Hey, it’s fine to admit it. You and I are the same.”

I didn’t wait to hear Dylan’s response.

All I knew was that Nathanial was inside, and alive—or at least in a state where he could be handed over. Which meant I still had a chance to save him. I left Freddie and Dylan, eager to get to the back room inside Clay’s office. 

But when I was throwing the door open, I found myself in the kitchen. I came to a standstill, managing to press myself against the wall to avoid being caught. Violet was humming to herself, and the first thing I saw was the glistening red slick between her palms, and then my gaze found the familiar jacket in a bundle on the counter. 

I knew that jacket. I’d seen it loose and hanging off Nathanial’s shoulders when I was running after him. Violet’s smile didn’t waver as she stuffed the jacket into a trash bag, and then threw it in the garbage. 

Then she looked down at her blood-slick hands, frowned, and swiped at her apron. Then she swiped again, her cheeks paling. I already knew what was going to happen. After all, she had told me. When Violet slapped her hand over her mouth, disappearing into the girl’s bathroom, the sounds of violent retching following, I forced myself to stride over to the trash can and pulled out the bag. Nathanial’s jacket was covered in blood, wet and warm and thick with it. Tears stung my eyes, and my chest ached. I was running my hands over the hem of the jacket when something… flashed in my eyes. 

At first, I thought it was a migraine, but there was no pain, only the dizzying sensation of falling backward, plunging deep, deep down. *You need to go,* a disembodied voice whispered in my skull. It was another kid. *Tonight, you idiot. They’ll be coming for you.* It was like watching a movie in slow motion. 

I saw it in bursts of color and swimming light, a grey room with barred windows, a single bed, and a desk. There was a kid in front of me, but I couldn’t make out an identity. I could only feel his hands on my shoulders--- on Nathanial’s shoulders. *I’m not joking around!* the boy yelled. *You need to go. They’ll be dropping the barrier when the new runner comes in, and…* he trailed off with a hiss. *Nate, I’m being serious! They took Lily and Alex!*

*Yeah, and what makes you think they’re taking me?* Nathanial’s voice had a sardonic bite. *I told you I’m getting all of us out of here.*

*Whatever they’re doing to us,* the shadowy boy’s voice broke, *I don’t think they’re just killing us. They want us for something.* His grip tightened on my—on his—shoulder. 

*Uncle Rory told us to run before he disappeared, so why aren’t we?* He shook Nathanial, and light bled through the shadow. I could see crazed eyes, eyes that weren’t human, and yet Nathanial trusted them with his life. *So why are we still here?” He answered his own question through a breath. *Conrad.*

*They’re draining him to keep the façade of this place, and it's killing him.*

*Exactly!*

*Relax,* Nathanial murmured. *I’m going tonight. The runner is scheduled for ten, so I’ll make a break for it.*

The vision or flash, or whatever it was, disintegrated around me, making way for screams clawing into my skull, Nathanial’s cries bleeding into me, and the horrifying sound of spinning blades growing closer and closer to him. 

He was strapped down, cruelly tied to a metal table like cows to the slaughter. Please. I felt his lips mouth the words, begging for mercy, trying to use his ability, and failing, swimming blue energy bursting into life and then crackling out with little strength. I could see Dylan looming over him, his eyes dark, jaw set into a line. There was a blur of spinning silver at the corner of his—my—eyes, and we couldn’t get away from it. We couldn’t escape it. 

Oh god, he was in my head. 

All of him was in my head! His terror, which was almost childish fear turning his heart to stone, his thoughts to mush. I felt the first sensation of impact, of searing, agonizing pain which was like an explosion, like everything hitting him at once in one glorifying and horrifying bang, before nothing—before almost heavenly peace swamping around his mind and body, sending me to my knees, back in reality, my own scream tangled and choked in my throat. 

I dropped the jacket, and it hit the ground. And then I picked it up and stuffed it into the trash, my heart freefalling, my stomach twisting and turning, and trying to projectile into my throat. They killed him. I was barely aware of finding my feet and taking steps towards the door like a robot, reaching forward and yanking it open. They fucking… killed him. 

They murdered him. 

“Addie?” 

Violet’s voice felt far away as I found myself back at the storefront, and then I was walking out into the early night, staring up at a dark sky with no moon. Jun was nowhere to be seen. But part of me didn’t care. Part of me didn’t know what to do except keep walking and try not to bring up everything I had eaten. I threw myself through the late evening commute, shouldering past a woman and a screaming child, a kid yelling on his phone. The world became one big confusing blur of nothing. 

They killed him. I don’t know how I got home, everything felt out of place. The people around me didn’t look or sound real. It was when I stepped over the threshold of my house, I knew something was wrong, and my mind snapped back to attention. I felt it deep inside me, something pricking my nerve endings and telling me to run. Before I could, my door slammed behind me, the hallway lights above flickering erratically. There was a blonde girl sitting on my couch watching TV. 

Slumped lazily, she almost looked at home, wrapped in my fluffy pink bathrobe, damp curls hanging in rat tails in front of her face. The girl was maybe nineteen or even younger, flicking through Apple TV with a small smile etched on her lips. "You have a cute house," she murmured, her gaze straying on the TV. "It's cute! Very…"

She wiggled her foot, and I could tell her smile was lesser than-- her eyes dark. With the way her leg was shifting back and forth, it almost seemed like she was trembling. But not with fear.  "Minimalist." The girl finished. 

I definitely heard the word come from her mouth. I watched her lips curve into each syllable. Min-im-ma-list. It was towards the end when the air suddenly moved in front of me, and before I knew what was happening, all the breath was being sucked from my lungs. In half a second, I realized the air wasn't moving. I was. Fast. Things were moving too fast, my living room spinning around me in a swimming blur before I slammed into my back wall, my head hitting paintwork with a thick, meaty smack. I opened my mouth, lips forming an O, but no sound came out. 

I couldn't breathe. 

My body was screaming, my bones reduced to jelly, but I couldn't move. Looking down, I was aware of warm wetness sliding from my nose and mouth. And when my thoughts started to trudge into fruition, I came to the dizzying realization that I was hovering three feet from the ground.

This time I did scream, the pain of the impact dragging a screech from my gritted teeth. I was stuck, paralyzed, both of my arms crucifying me to the wall. 

*Minimalist.*

The girl's words were still ringing in my head, rattling in my skull like they themselves were a physical entity. I tried to scream again, but a force had taken over me, closing my mouth and pinning my legs. "So, you're the new runner girl." The smooth voice came from the doorway, and I twisted my head, following the low murmur filling the silence. There were two figures. 

I slid down the wall, my feet barely grazing the paintwork. 

Males. But I couldn't see their faces, any semblance of identity blanketed in shadow. I could see that one was a messy blonde, while the other had reddish-brown curls tied into a ponytail. The two of them approached me like wild animals, unsteady and unsure, the one in front taking the lead and holding back the one behind. 

The redhead wore a trench coat which was too big for him, while the blonde stuck to a simple t-shirt and jeans. "Hold her," when one of the shadows situated himself in front of me, while the other stepped back, a fresh coating of bile crept up my throat. 

They were doing this-- or at least, the boy who had taken a step back was. He folded his arms. His face was like staring at uncanny valley, a human figure with no identity, no expression, only a t-shirt with a smiley face on the front. Drowning in the overhead light, these boys should have had a face. 

But they didn't. They should have made sense, at this time, where normality was home. Where I felt safe. But they didn't. While the other boy kept me pinned to the wall, moving me up and down with a simple twitch of his wrist, the one in front took another step toward me. 

I could feel his warm breath tickling my cheeks. He was human, and alive, breathing, thinking, and moving like normal-- and yet nothing about him was neither human nor normal. I couldn’t even see his eyes. I couldn’t see if he was angry or scared, or exhilarated at the thought of pinning me and stealing breath from my lungs. “Don’t fight back,” the shadow's voice was a low hum skating the back of my mind, “if you fight back, I will fucking wipe you clean, and that will be your fault."

“Aww, Conrad’s trying to be intimidating!” the girl hadn’t moved from the couch, her wide eyes stuck to my TV, lips pulled into a grin. “Adorable!”

"Shh!" The other shadow hushed her, twisting to her. I could see his hands flexing expertly, fingers moving, tightening his grip on my body. 

It's hard to describe the act of being violated mentally, though I could feel phantom fingers grasping onto my skull and squeezing it enough to crack me open. When his ice-cold fingers grazed my temples, I knew what he was going to do, and I knew he couldn’t get inside my mind. Because if he did… I tried to think about anything else, ignoring his threat. I thought about my senior year trip to France-- and the time I was bitten by a spider and spent two days in the ER. But this boy was stronger, easily breaking down the barriers I had put up, and forcing his way into my mind. 

Suddenly, I saw memories I had forgotten, memories that were still dear to me, all of them flashing in front of me like an animated photo album. I saw Jun's smiling face, his lips around his flask. I saw Violet standing behind the counter. Oh, no. I could feel this boy's desperation as he dove further, cutting into me. Dylan's face flashed into my mind, and then Freddie's. 

Before they could speak, thankfully, he skipped right past them until I saw myself from my own perspective, reaching out for the dead Buggie's jacket with trembling hands. 

The memory came over me, thick and heavy, overwhelming me. I heard Nathanial's cries echoing-- but before the blur of silver could impact him, the boy was retracting himself from my mind. Not before another explosion of light hit the backs of my eyes. 

This time I was at Grand Court House. 

But not the one I knew. Standing in a line of a dozen little kids squashed shoulder to shoulder, four figures stood in front of them. Violet. She was younger, prettier. She had so much life on her face, color in her cheeks. 

Freddie.

He looked... human. Normal, and yet his eyes also sparked with the first signs of insanity glittering through a crumbling facade. Standing next to him was Clayton and a young guy with a friendly smile that wasn't vindictive like Violet or pure greed like Freddie. It was reassuring. A sharp hiss caught me off guard, and the memory splintered into pieces. When I opened my eyes, I was nose-to-nose with both of the boys. 

And this time they had faces. Human faces. They were just students. Kids. While one had a baby face, the other sporting rough five-o'clock shadow. The redhead's head was slightly inclined, his lips curved into a frown, while the blonde-- who had dug inside my head-- was scowling. "I can't see anything," he stepped back, nose wrinkling. I caught a stray rivulet of red slip from his nose, before he swiped it away with a frustrated hiss. 

"Did you go deep?" the kid behind him asked. His expression bordered on amusement, lips curled into a small smile. He jerked his hand, and my head snapped around, a striking pain running up and down my spine. 

"Yes. Obviously." The blonde rolled his eyes. "She hasn't seen him since picking him up last night."

His gaze flicked to me, eyes narrowing. "What did you do with Nate?”

Before I could answer, someone knocked on my door, and the guy who had been holding me, jumped, losing control. I slipped to the ground, though I barely felt the impact. “That will be Dylan,” I said in a hiss. I found myself overwhelmed by a sudden urge to protect these Buggie's, after seeing Nathanial's fate. “You need to hide.” When the three of them grew defensive, I shoved the leader back. “I know who you all are,” I gritted out. “And they’re hunting you down just like your friend. They're going to kill you."

That seemed to scare them enough into hiding. The redhead crawled under the coffee table, while the other two dove into my pantry.

Close enough.

When I opened my door, however, it wasn’t Dylan. It was Jun, with unfocused eyes, swaying slightly resembling a puppet on strings. His lips moved, but they weren’t his words, instead coming out in a tangled mimic. “We need a runner, and you’re the only one we have,” Jun droned. There was the tiniest flicker of blue light in his eyes, illuminating the night. “The Category 10 was sold, but we have another VIP who wants him, and I'm in a shit load of trouble for selling him alive to an old friend. We need someone whom they won't recognize to infiltrate their headquarters and bring out the Buggie, so no, Addie,” Jun punched me square in the jaw, and I was sent sprawling to my knees, blood pouring from my nose, black spots drowning my vision.

“You don’t have a choice.”

And so began my slow descent into the world of brain-eating psychopaths.
