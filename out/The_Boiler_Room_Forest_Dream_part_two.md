I took a few days off from writing. My memories flooding back, stinging me like a scorpion - Poisonous, my arms turn black and the filth pumps through my veins. I can see them, I want to cut my veins open to let it out - But I know that’s insane. I, well I, I don’t know. My computer hums - the blue light from the screen blinding, but seductive - Like a siren beckoning me to write more. I’m trembling, shaking in every little crevice, every pore of mine feels like butter - I’m sick. If you’re sick like me you’ll understand. 



It’s like when your child does something awful and you’re to blame. Well I am to blame, but don’t dare say I didn’t fucking try. I did. But it wasn’t enough, I wish it was. They didn’t have to suffer - Everyone now views me in a terrible light. The madness it spread. No, the madness - That madness was always there. If the, well I don’t know what to call that other world, Wonderland was always there - Then the madness was always a part of life. Only the mad can access Wonderland, and the night I was chosen as a guest changed my life forever.



Wonderland would change depending on who was the dominant one - For Colin, his madhouse was a mechanical forest of boilers and steam pipes - His view of the world was mechanical, yes, I suppose that is why. Oh Colin, why did you do it? Why? My hands hurt - I force them to type like a slave owner to his slaves. Am I a slave to myself? I am trapped in the hell I have created. Yes, and no. 



I remember what happened after I received those calls. The day after was a quiet morning - Filled with snowflakes and a winter wet dream - It was perfect. The snow crunched under my feet, my boots were still wet from yesterday. My job is close to my house, so I didn't feel the need to drive when I could just walk.



Oh that snow, that lovely snow - Pure white ecstasy. They say there are no identical snowflakes - That everyone is unique. I think about that as I walk. It's almost blinding out here, yet it is so beautiful I don't squint my eyes - Frost has taken shape on the trees - Lining them and decorating their boring wood and leaves.



I'm nearing the hospital - Cars pass by - Attempting to navigate the icy road. Someone should really lay salt down. Crunch, crunch - People go about their morning too through thin air.  I take a look at myself in a parked car's window. My reflection is a little bit out of focus, a little bit dirty - But I can still see my eyes staring back - Those brown empty marbles.



I'm in the hospital, ignoring the nurses and staff, opening my office door and sitting down - Sliding open the secret drawer of alcohol. I take it and chug. - It hits every flavor receptor and burns. I must confess that I feel like a monster. Tonight I’m doing it, going back to that place, and I’m going to record it. The world has to know about that place. My shakes, the liquor splashing inside the bottle. Colin will be here soon; he comes in the mornings now ever since Christmas break started. He’s coming. I put the bottle away. The clock ticks, tick, ticking. A nurse knocks on my door, “Dr. Hancock, Mr. Bedlam has arrived.” Why do you have to be so formal? Just call him Colin, it’s more casual that way. 



The nurse exits, Colin comes in. “You look terrible.” He jokes, “Couldn’t sleep or half n’ half?” A callback to something I asked before.



“Got some strange calls last night, they freaked me out.” I grab my notebook and a pen, “How have you been feeling?”



Colin takes his coat off and wraps it around the therapy chair; I can see through him - The bones - A symptom of not eating. “I had that weird dream again,” he says and suddenly I’m tuned in, “But it went a little different this time.”



“Can you elaborate, Colin?” Ink bleeds onto the page.



“Well, I was there in the same boiler room-thing, but I was alone. The man with the knife wasn’t there. Instead, I heard in the distance the ringing of a phone, right? So I follow the noise and there’s this, um, hmmm, almost ancient phone - The type you have to pick up and has strings attached. I’m listening to this buzzing sound, and suddenly on the other end, a man is pleading for me to save him - Screaming in this inhuman way. I was scared, but afraid, and then it just ended. And I woke up.” He’s honest, I can hear it in his voice.



A question arises, ‘How are Colin and I experiencing the same events but altered?’ This isn’t right, no, it - He has to be the one with the knife in the dream. And if he was the knife man, then that would mean Colin was also the phone guy. However, he’s telling the truth - Everything from his body language to his inflection is truthful. I don’t know.



“And this man, what sounds was he making?” Colin slowly levitates off the chair -  Pulled upwards through thin air, he doesn’t notice.



“Moaning noises,” he looked down at me, “He was moaning.” He looks down at his thin wrists, “I keep feeling like there’s someone or something else. I can’t explain it. I feel like if I don’t figure out what’s happening here, something bad will happen.” He rubs his head, “I don’t think I've ever had a normal dream, isn’t that funny?” His lips twitch into a smile, a cannibal animal-like contortion - I’m not as bemused as him.  I can sense his mind is elsewhere. I laugh a little.



“Like I’ve got fire at my fingertips.” Colin almost says something more,  convincing himself he's okay. “Can I trust anyone?” He realizes something odd - Silence - Absolute. An animal caught in a trap. He looks down at his hands -  The skin is ripped, bleeding, trickling to the floor -  Nothing. 



“Well now that’s funny.” He jests. “It’s like I’m fighting to survive.”  Suddenly my hand burns, I cry out - Now bloody, burnt. The clock ticks - Nothing changes. A gust of wind blows into the room, ruffling the blue curtains.



Colin's eyes bug out.



I watch my blood dripping out of my hand - Drip, drip, drip -  Keeps bleeding. I glance up at Colin, his face now porcelain - Painted like a doll - Tendrils growing -  Staring into the faces of everyone - Not understanding.



“Can you hear me?” I ask, soft and muffled - A non answer.  I sit there watching - A quick flash of an image: A hangs himself from a noose on a ceiling fan. The tendrils slam into the walls, merging with them, turning it into a flesh-like substance. The tendrils spread, touching everything and infecting them. They creep my body, it feels slimy and smells of pork. It suffocates me - Turning black.



And when the light shines again, I’m on a boat.



Colin is nowhere to be seen. A fog is coming in the distance.
