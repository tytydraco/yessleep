We don’t get the kinda beasties down here that I see a lot of on this sub. A lot of what I've read centres around Native American teachings. Which is both fascinating and among the most nightmare inducing tales I've ever come across...

Down here in Australia? Our tales are of another world entirely. I’ve seen some stuff. A lot of it we don’t even know what to call. Our First Nations stories, or more accurately, "Aboriginal Dreamings", aren’t as well documented as your Native American stories are, sadly. A lot of it got all but wiped out during the colonial years, and far beyond come to think of it.

But there are bits and piece. There are voices that keep the old stories alive. And a few of em seem to tie in pretty neatly with what we saw that night. I mentioned above an important distinction. Do you know why the Aboriginal people refer to their stories as "The Dreaming"? It is because, for all intents and purposes, this is not fiction. The Dreaming, or more commonly The Dreamtime, is a very real *time before time* in Aboriginal culture. It is a place, and a time, that actually happened. This is troubling for those of us who live in the more rural and secluded parts of this country. Places where the bright lights of civilisation fail to dull the echoes of these ancient times.

So with that in mind, to my story. Me and my best mate Gavin, we grew up together in Home Hill. It's one of the two townships either side of the mighty Burdekin river. There's Ayr, the bigger of the two towns on one side, and our sleepy little country town on the other side. Connecting the two towns, the massive Burdekin bridge stretching over the river.

Now, this is at the mouth of the Burdekin, so as you can imagine saltwater crocodiles are prominent here. These guys are some of the most dangerous animals down here in the down under. They are among the oldest species still alive on planet earth, and for over 240 millenniums they have perfected the art of the hunt. You're always told here not to get too close to the water's edge. This is because crocodiles will literally sit under the murky water, invisible to the human eye, for hours on end, just waiting for some poor soul to wander too close. The last thing that person will ever hear is an earth shattering crack as this actual dinosaur smashes through the surface of the water, grasping them tight within its jaws and dragging them down to the murky depths. It's honestly the stuff of nightmares.

This is something Gav and I were very conscious of when we headed out for our very first camping trip alone. Like a lot of Aussie kids growing up, we used to camp out a lot in our back yards, not being old enough yet to camp out for real. But this all changed the year we hit 15 years old, and we were given the freedom to wander down to the river and have little overnight campouts. 

Now these excursions came with strict rules. No swimming of course. And no going anywhere near the water’s edge. As well as all the other croc safe stuff we're taught around here, such as not leaving food or scraps out around the campsite, this is basically like waving a red flag at a bull and it's a sure way to wake up in the middle of the night to a 6 metre long monster chowing down on your leftovers, and possibly you.

So here we are, heading out for our first campout. Oh boy did we feel like big men. All alone, nothing but our sleeping bags, a tent and a few overnight supplies. Ready to tackle the big wide world. We followed all the rules though, we weren’t silly. We set up camp around mid day in a picture perfect little spot. The sandy riverbank blending with the typical Aussie bushland to create a beautiful oasis among an otherwise baron landscape. We propped up our little tent under the shade of a couple of gumtrees, and we spent the next few hours toasting marshmallows, drinking way too much softdrink and chatting back and forth about typical high school stuff.

As night set in, along with all the winter chill of an Australian July, we retreated into our tent. We of course sat up well into the night, telling each other scary stories, as young fellas do. I was mid way through yarning on about some ghost story or another, when, in the dead of the night, we pause. It's only faint, but we can hear something. A distant sound, but easily identifiable... a slow, ominous dragging noise… This caused us to bolt upright. There’s only one thing around here making a sound like that. There’s a crocodile, dragging itself up the river bank. Towards us.

We shut off our torches, and we huddled toward the back of the tent, our eyes locked on the front of the tent, looking for any signs of this thing, hoping beyond hope this dragging sound would cease, or grow ever more distant as the thing disappeared off into the night. Gavin started feeling around for his pocket knife. We were planning to cut a hole in the back of the tent and make a run for it. We couldn’t go out the front, as it could be waiting right there for us. We would be running right into its mouth. Even if it was still a good distance away, people are often amazed how quickly these guys can move on land. There was every chance we'd still be dead.

The dragging sound continued. *Ghsshhhhh…. Flop… Ghsshhhhh…. Flop…* Yeah, no doubt, that’s a croc. With trembling hands we continued fumbling around looking for the pocket knife to make our escape, but we couldn’t find it. That dragging sound was so close now, and we could hear the thing sniffing around. We could hear the disgusting, guttural noises coming out of it, as it poked around our campsite. This was serious now. We were very much in a life or death situation. We had two options here, we could sit still and hope that this thing doesn’t smell us, or we could try our luck running out the front tent flap. We tried desperately ripping a hole in the tent with our bare hands but we just couldn’t do it, and the way this tent was built we couldn’t just lift it up and run out the back. We were trapped. Even if we wanted to consider running, honestly we were frozen in place. I don’t think that was ever gonna be an option.

I don’t know how long we sat frozen like that. I mean, it must have been a matter of less than a minute, but my God let me tell you, it felt like much longer. But eventually, we heard a different kind of dragging sound. One that went on for much longer, and was headng away from our campsite. The croc was dragging itself away? No… the croc was ***being*** dragged away! We could hear its jaws snapping. We could hear the sound of heavy foot falls. And then, we heard the most disgusting sounds of flesh tearing, ligaments ripping, innards spilling. Oh it was horrible. Whatever was happening out there we got the impression that we were now faced with something much worse than a croc. There was something out there, big enough to drag a crocodile forcefully away, and by the sounds of things, kill it.

We continued sitting there just huddled at the back of the tent, listening to the sounds of an animal we had grown up being told to fear, being brutally ripped to pieces. This went on for far too long. Whatever was doing this, had made a concious choice to prolong this thing's suffering. And then... there was silence. The animal stopped resisting, and we heard only the sound of a lifeless body falling helplessly to the ground. Then silence yet again. Nothing but the ambience of the night… until the sounds of heavy foot steps once again reverberated through the still air.

I don’t know what the hell we were thinking. We could have just sat there. We could hear the footsteps moving away, we should have just stayed put. I don’t know, maybe we thought that because whatever this was had killed the crocodile that it was somehow friendly? I don't know. We were stupid kids. We were panicked. We were in a state of complete and total shock. But for whatever stupid pig headed reason, we slowly unzipped the tent and stuck our dumb little heads out into the darkness.

It was illuminated under the moonlight. And it was massive. I mean, ***MASSIVE***. At least 8 ft tall, probably bigger. Its limbs were not human, nah, far from it. They were all cracked and broken and honestly looked like the whole thing’s body was made of stone. It was lumbering away into the river. It was just... wading through the water like it wasn’t bothered. It dragged something in its hand. Something long and sharp. I guess that’s what had mutilated our crocodile.

Yeah, that’s what else we saw. There certainly had been a croc. But not anymore. This was no small specimen either, this croc must have been at least a 5 metre saltie. Its lifeless body lay by the river’s edge, a massive cut down its belly. There is nothing out here capable of doing that. Or so we thought…

We watched in awe as this… *thing*… continued to wander off into the night. As it walked it released these inhuman sounds, grunting and grumbling as it disappeared into the bushland on the far side of the river. Those sounds still haunt me today. I have no doubt this thing was not a friend. It was out for blood. The attack was just too vicious, too deliberate. It wasn’t there to lend us a hand. That crocodile just happened to be the easiest thing in its path. Maybe it noticed us, maybe it knew we were in the tent and we were just too much of a hassle to get to, maybe it didn’t know. I don’t know. But those questions do trouble me, thinking back.

The incident did lead me to look deeper into Aussie monster stories. To the point that I now have a pretty high level of confidence that what we saw that night was the Malingee. The First Nations people will tell you stories about him. They, too, know that he is not a friend, and like all of their tales it is deeply steeped in reality. Well I know for sure now that this one certainly is.

I don’t go to that spot anymore. Far as I’m concerned that’s his territory, and he can keep it. I warned others about what we saw that night, and I still do to this day. Tried to tell our parents all about it the night it happened but, of course they brushed it off as scared kids and their imaginations. I’ve not heard of any more attacks or run ins. And I’m glad for that. I’d rather not be proven right on this one.
