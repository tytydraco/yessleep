I was sitting at my laptop in the evening, scrolling mindlessly through the internet, while the television played in the background more as noise than entertainment and somewhere outside the neighbors were arguing, their voices muted by walls and distance, and God, it had been such an exhausting day.  
But it was Friday night, finally, and the thought that the weekend lay ahead of me made my shoulders sink just a little, even though the exhaustion still sat deep in my body.

My eyes lingered on a post written by a guy who called himself the Seer, someone who claimed to know the truth, though he never said what truth that was. Normally I would have scrolled past without a second thought, but that evening I had nothing better to do, so I clicked on his profile.

There was exactly one post.

The image showed a painted door, black on white, rough and almost childlike, yet there was something deeply unsettling about it, and beneath it sat a link with no explanation and no comments, just the link itself and the note that it could only be opened using the Tor browser.

That was the moment when any normal person would have stopped, but I didn’t.

Curiosity had always been my greatest weakness, and boredom only made it worse, so I downloaded the browser, which didn’t take long, and when the installation window disappeared I sat there for a moment, staring at the screen.

Now or never.

I copied the link into the search bar and pressed Enter, and the browser loaded painfully slowly, my internet connection probably acting up again, seconds passing and then minutes, until just as I started to think nothing would happen at all, the page finally appeared.

A black background with white text.

"You know nothing.  
But sometimes it is better not to know."

Another link waited beneath it.

I sighed quietly, wondering if this was all just some elaborate joke, my jaw tightening as I moved the cursor over the link, and part of me knew I should stop now, should have stopped already, yet instead I clicked again.

The next page loaded.

An old television appeared on the screen, not quite like a simple image but more like a live stream of a TV standing in an unfamiliar room, the picture flickering slightly as if the signal were unstable, and beneath it was a single button labeled TURN ON.

I didn’t hesitate and clicked it.

The television flickered one last time and then text appeared on the screen.

"You have chosen.  
Soon the truth will reveal itself to you."

The words vanished and in the next moment my own face stared back at me, just me, captured from an angle inside my room where there was nothing but a plain white wall.

Before I could react the screen went black, the laptop making no sound at all, simply dead.

I sat there motionless, my heart suddenly beating far too fast, trying to understand what the hell had just happened.

I pressed the power button in a rush and nothing happened, no light, no fan, no familiar sound, and a cold feeling crept down my spine.

No, that couldn’t be right, I must have imagined the photo out of sheer exhaustion, and the laptop dying was probably just a coincidence.

I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself, knowing that in the morning I would have to take it to a technician instead of sleeping in, which felt painfully typical.

I must have fallen asleep on the couch, because the thought of going up to my room on the second floor had stirred too much resistance in me, and it felt strangely good as my body grew heavy and my thoughts loosened and drifted without direction.

Then a sound slipped into my sleep.

A hum.

Not high and irritating like an insect, but deep and steady, like the low droning of an old refrigerator, settling directly behind my forehead and refusing to be ignored.

I groaned softly and opened my eyes.

Yellow carpet, right in front of my face.

I was lying on my side, the floor rough beneath me and slightly damp, the air carrying the stale scent of old fabric, and when I lifted my head and looked around, my stomach tightened.

The room had no windows, no furniture, nothing at all, only walls completely covered in yellowed wallpaper in slightly different shades, all of them wrong in the same quiet way.

The humming came from everywhere and nowhere at once.

This was not my house.
