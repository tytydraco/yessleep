Do you know that story called “Humans can lick too”? The one where the girl wakes up in the middle of the night, pets her dog for comfort, and later discovers that the dog was dead in the bathroom, with that sentence written in blood on the mirror? Well. I just discovered that in 2009 something basically identical to that story actually happened. I found newspapers, documents, reports, and other records about the case. Don’t ask me how I got this information, but I will share some parts of the facts here.

In 2009, in the city of (censored), in the state of (censored), the dogs of some children began to die, and their bodies were always found in a nearly theatrical way, completely mutilated, inside the bathrooms of their homes. There were always sentences written in blood on the mirror and/or on the bathroom walls. The phrases were always things that apparently made little sense, and this caused many problems for the police. But something that frightened the population even more were reports that something with a dog’s face was walking around at night. Some said it was a creature, a monster, others said it didn’t exist and that it was imagination or just confusion. At night, anything can become a monster.

Some things worth mentioning about this:  
 1 – The children who owned the dead dogs were from the same classroom, so there might be some connection.  
 2 – The phrases were always related to the killer, such as “I am not the monster here,” “I was molded by your hands,” etc. Some phrases were never released or were lost.  
 3 – Local people started calling the killer “Psycodog,” but this nickname was never made official by the press or the police.  
 4 – It was widely discussed in the region that this “Monster” was the one killing the dogs. I will talk about this later.

I managed to gather some stories from people in the region, and some of the children’s diaries were made public. I also obtained the names of the students from class 2-B of the school (censored.

The students were:  
 Adam Lewis  
 Aaron Fletcher  
 Claire Bennett  
 Daniel Foster  
 Emily Bones  
 Emily Stretch  
 Gregory Tauk  
 Hannah Reed  
 Isabelle Monroe  
 Jennifer Jonhson  
 Julia Parker  
 Kara Madison  
 Karina Madison  
 Leo Nakamura  
 Louis Harrington  
 Mack Collins  
 Marina Stuart  
 Max Silvanno  
 Megan Hill  
 Megan Turner  
 Nathan Brooks  
 Olivia Barnes  
 Pandora Petrakis  
 Samuel Whitaker  
 Sarah Coleman  
 Sofia Sorensen  
 Steve Holt  
 Stuart Marsh  
 Thomas Trent  
 William Williams

There were 30 students. Most of them were 16 years old, some were 17 when the case occurred.

You might be asking yourself, as I did when I first saw this case, why almost no one knows about it. Why didn’t the police care? The city’s police were alerted, but they didn’t do much because it only involved dogs, and apparently the killer did not harm people, even though many talked about a so-called “monster.”

The case lasted about a month and a half, between June and July. The children had quite a vacation, didn’t they?

Did the police arrest someone, a suspect? Yes. A math teacher who was responsible for class 2-B. Carlos Prado was arrested by the police inside his own home.

But I believe the teacher is innocent. You see, in the reports of the dogs’ deaths, there is one last dog killed three days after the teacher was arrested. So it would be impossible for him to be the killer, right? Wh .-- .... -.--  -.. .. -..  -- --- --

*I hate Louis. I hate Steve. I HATE MACK. Why are they so cruel? They humiliated me again, in front of the entire class, and everyone laughed. Even S (scratched out) laughed. I didn’t like seeing her laugh at me. I can’t talk to Dad about anything, and… Mom… no, not Mom. Why does Mom do what she does? She’s not like the other mothers. But I love Mom, I think. I HATE. The boys make me think about things that aren’t good, blood, violence, DEATH. I just wanted peace.*

\-.. ---  - .... .- -? y would a math teacher kill the students’ dogs and write such macabre and personal messages on the mirror?

Remember when I mentioned the monster? I didn’t talk more about it because I believe I discovered what this monster was. He was the one killing the dogs, yes, but it wasn’t something supernatural. H -- -.-- 

*It was horrible. I was finishing painting a letter I had made for Santa Claus. I know I’m in the 8th grade, but I still like to think that this way it would be easier to get a present. I don’t know, I like Christmas. I used to like it. I was painting the letter when Mack stole it from my desk and started reading it to the whole class. I asked for a dog for Christmas. I just wanted to have a dog. But even that the boys ruined. They started reading it out loud and telling everyone that I still believe in Santa Claus. Everyone laughed… again. And the teacher did nothing. I hate math.*

\-.. .-. . .- -- ow did I discover this? I didn’t. I just created a very good theory, at least in my opinion. While reading the police reports that I… found, I noticed something. In the population’s reports, the “Monster” was described as a person with a dog’s face, a black dog, a long snout, and drooping ears. The eyes wide open in a strange way. But now pay attention: the case of the dead dogs happened between June and July, but in April, a dog that was known in the region, always seen near the gas station and the bar, simply disappeared. He could very well have been run over or gone somewhere else. But he had been in the area for three years and was always given food and water by the residents.

What if the killer of the dogs used this local dog as a test? According to reports, residents said this dog was somewhat antisocial, didn’t stay close, and didn’t accept affection from just anyone. He also barked at some people for no apparent reason. The killer seems to have a hatred for dogs. He could already have had a violent nature and ended up killing this dog, and to avoid being recognized, he used the dog’s face as a mask. That’s not a bad theory, right?

I haven’t completely finished my research yet, but these are the pieces of information I was able to put together here. I will release more information and more parts of this story in the future.
