Hello reader. For privacy reasons, I will be referred to as Laurence. And this is a story of when I lived next to Lake Lanier. For context, I am 5'6 Caucasian Male and I was 20 at the time when this happened. I was living in a 4 story house. Well, if you want to count the attic as part of the stories, otherwise 3 story. My neighborhood was peaceful and lots of good neighbors that usually keep to themselves. I lived with my brother, sister, Dad, and our roommate who did the cooking most nights and helped out with other things. My brother and sister were born 12 months apart and the same year but my sister is usually a year older than my brother till the final month. Now lets get this out of the way so I can tell you my story of how it all began.

It was on my day off during the Summer of 2020. I was driving my younger Brother and I to the park that was at Lake Lanier. For privacy reasons, we will refer to my brother as Eli.

"So Eli," I asked him. "Are you ready for some quality brotherly time?"

"Yeah." Eli said, some sort of monotone to his voice.

Don't get us wrong, Eli and I get along very well for brothers. Sure in our childhood we had our little fights and nit picks but we were just kids and it's kinda natural for siblings to have their little disagreements. Eli, while 3-4 years younger than me, was definitely taller than I was. Almost 6'0 I can safely say. But He'll always be my younger Brother that I love dearly.

"Okay wanna take the fishing poles or the bags?" I asked him.

"I can take the bags." He said, carrying my backpack and some of our snacks.

"Wonderful." I said, grabbing the poles and my phone out of the car before shutting it and locking. If you are wondering, my car is a Chevy Impala 2014. It gets me around awesomely from Point A to Point B. My silver Steed if you will.

Where we arrived, there was a mini beach, a safe area for swimming, lots of picnic tables, and plenty of woods to hike. With me being...well .. me... I never liked to swim in the waters. Why? Lake Lanier is supposedly haunted and many people including professional swimmers lose their lives here. I wasn't ready to be on headline news. I was just here to fish.

"Have any ideas for a spot Laurence?" Eli asked.

"Hmmm.." I was scanning the area and spots around that didn't have too many people. I'm not really a people person to be honest. To some it's me being anxious. But for me, I absolutely can't. Especially when you have kids screaming at the top of their lungs. "How about over there?"

My brother nodded and we walked over in that direction. We have passed a guy who looked to be in his 40s and someone maybe in his early 20s I assumed was his son. They had just caught a huge largemouth bass. It was quite a sight. My brother and I had reached the spot and took a seat, setting up our fishing stuff. I had chosen a night crawler and him artificial bait. His resembled a crawfish.

"So you've picked that one?" I asked Eli.

"Yep. It's more realistic than flip flop designs." He had that weird grin and then faced the lake, holding his arm back to cast. I watched him almost like flick his wrist to send his line far out. If I had a good guess, it was about maybe 50 feet. I would normally say it's impressive but that was truly incredible. "Try that one out Laurence."

"You're on!" I laughed then took a deep breath, casting out to the waters. Not as far as He did, less. But I gave a nervous grin as I admitted defeat. "That one was rigged."

"Sure it was." He said and stared out at the lake.

It felt like hours when in reality it was minutes. My brother's line started twitching then jerked. He pulled back and started reeling in the line. I got excited and sat my rod down quickly to watch him fight with whatever got the bait. The end of the pole was holding on as it bent downward and once it came into clearer view, He had caught a largemouth. It looked to be maybe 18 pounds. I didn't doubt my brother would lift it. He was stronger than myself after all. He laughed a little.

"Hey let me get a pic! Dad will be amazed!" I picked up my phone that I had left and opening the camera, positioned it to face him. He had a neutral expression like many photos he was in. I'm not one to tell you to smile. Whatever expression you want to use, I'd accept. "Great catch dude!"

"Thank you." He said, looking at the fish.

But as we celebrated his catch and him slowly going through the process of gently and respectfully releasing the fish, I happened to catch something unusual off in the distance. I couldn't gauge how far it was, but something... Or someone... Was peeking from behind a tree. Pure black, like a shadow, with 2 white dots that might've been the eyes. Wild hair like a cartoon individual that had been shocked by lightning. It stood there. I had to rub my eyes, squinting. It remained.

"Hey... Eli?" I asked.

"Yeah?" He said. "What's up Laurence?"

"Do you see that? Just ahead." I pointed behind him in the direction of the thing.

"Huh?" He turned around and looked back at me. "No. I do not. Are you ok?"

I will admit I have been feeling very anxious lately. Down. Depression even. I had recently been broken up with by my ex girlfriend of 4 years who we will call Bridget as well as the passing of our family cat Carl. He has been my buddy since I was 10. And for him to suddenly be gone before christmas, a week before, was hell for me. It was so much weight for me to carry over my shoulders. Perhaps this was my negative emotions playing tricks on my brain? It has to be that...

"Laurence," Eli said. "I know your breakup with Bridget and the death of Carl has been weighing you down. And I can't tell you to shrug it off. But please, try and ease up."

"Right..." I looked at the thing that was still there. Maybe it was grief in the physical form of my struggle to let go. "You could be right. I'm sorry."

"I love you buddy." He said before walking us back to our spot. It was only one more turn of my head before I realized the thing vanished but that's when it began. I clutched my chest and started breathing heavily. My sound got his attention and He looked at me. "Laurence?"

I had fallen to my knees, wanting to cry but nothing came out. The figure didn't disappear but moved. It was now closer. Like maybe the distance of 2 school busses parked behind the other. The figure was more clear to me. Still black as a shadow and those two bright orbs I assumed were the eyes. Even as my vision blurred and I gasped for air, having symptoms of a combination of night terror and severe anxiety attacks, I saw the figure was feminine. So for this purpose, we'll say it's female. She had no mouth or nose. But those eyes were wide. For better description, research shadow people and you'll see what I mean. She walked closer and by some driving force of fear and potentially adrenaline, I got up fast and looked at my brother.

"Eli, we have to go to the car Now. Grab our things and let's go I can't stay here longer." I said and quickly collected our bags, running to the car. I turned back once to see how far he was. The figure didn't seem to stop to my younger brother but was advancing towards me still. She was after me. But why?

"Laurence what do you see? Is your glucose out of control?" Eli called out. But I was already in the car, waiting for him.

I couldn't answer. She was still following. But walking slowly. I could easily outwalk her. She was playing with me. What did She want? I shoved the key into the ignition and cranked the car. Once Eli had entered, I was ready to put the knob into reverse but the moment I touched it, It was to my realization that "She" was already there. I slowly turned my head to my window and saw her staring through it. She tilted her head and waved slowly, dragging her finger down the glass silently. I gasped again and couldn't breathe, gripping the stick shift and trembled before loosening my grip, the world going black and the last thing I heard was my brother calling 911 before I eventually passed out.

I had awoken at the house and Eli was at the foot of my bed. So was my sister Allison. My Dad walked in.

"Laurence what happened out there?" He had asked.

"Eli... Are you sure you didn't see her?" I gasped.

"Who?" He had confusion written on his face. "It was just you and I in the car. There was nobody there except the ambulance that later arrived and the police."

"It was some shadow..." I stuttered. I had described everything to them what I saw and the way the figured moved.

"Laurence you're still stressed out and you're most likely having hallucinations from the stress Overdrive." My Dad said. "Just rest for now and you should be better."

"Eli..." I looked at my brother. "What were my vitals? Was I okay?"

"They said your blood sugar was fine and your vitals were good. Maybe it's stress. Please... Relax."

"Alright." I wasn't one to argue unless I felt I was absolutely accused. But maybe they were right. I was overstimulating and panicked over it.

It felt like minutes before I had passed out again. It went from dark to a clear view of the sky. The skies were without clouds and it looked just like the ones you see in very old VHS looking movies. There was a castle sitting on the giant hills. The castle looked quite fancy a bit with a mixture of Transylvania. The camera panned down to show my brother and I in my car driving through the dark woods. Blue skies in the day time but the woods are dark because of the very tall pine trees shading us. It was me being the driver as usual. The trip was quiet. It was going smoothly until I saw the figure again. Only this time is very different. This one's shape was odd. A shorter individual, same weird spikes looking like hair struck by lightning on TV, but wearing a witches hat, all black. Same big bright white eyes. The figure was darting around in the woods stalking my brother and I.

"Hey Eli?" I asked. "Did you see that?"

"See what?" He asked, confused once more.

This was de ja vu. It's strange I even had that memory from the real world. This was a dream. This shadow was a munchkin. But equally giving me those same shudders and feelings of absolute fear as my body forced me to slam on the breaks. But why? Why was I unwillingly doing the opposite of the  natural responses of escaping danger? My hand shakingly reached for the knob and putting it in park, I rolled down my window and stared out, waiting. Waiting for what?

"Laurence?" Eli's voice sounded like it was coming from the distance. He was next to me though. What was going on? His face then slowly distorted and became enveloped in darkness, his entire body becoming a shadow as He ripped his own clothes off, his regular hands becoming clawed. Again, no details. Only darkness. My body was stuck in some sort of trance as the claws dug into my neck as the face formed a mouth. A white one. The eyes looking like scribbled circles. The munchkin had joined in with the shadow that had taken my brother's form previously and opened it's mouth to bite down on my neck. The feminine shadow from reality appeared, ripping my door off and putting her humanoid hand under my chin, turned me to face her. She then opened her mouth to let out a deafening shriek of horror but at the same time felt my soul leave my body as I awoke with a scream.

"Laurence!" Allison came in, shaking me. "Brother what's wrong? Are you ok?"

"Wh-where is Eli?" I asked, eyes looking around frantically. "He hasn't turned has He?"

"Kid," My Dad walked in. "Eli is okay. You're okay you're okay."

My Dad was a softy. He hugged me and held me. I was shaking. I felt so embarrassed as a male to cry. It was so horrifying. My Dad didn't need me to overdo it. He said It's natural to cry. Usually when I wanted to cry, I had to be alone. But usually Carl would be by my side, kissing me and rubbing against me. He wasn't here. It broke me more. I spoke his name a few times.

"Hey, buddy." My Dad let go. "There's nothing to hurt you. Nobody is gonna hurt you. I promise. You're safe here with us."

"Yes big brother." Allison hugged me. "We're here for you. Bridget is a nobody. Don't let her get ahold of your thoughts."

I turned my head to look at the window. I saw a mother bird with her babies, feeding them a worm. I slowed down my breathing, trying to ease up. It was difficult but eventually I was good again. I felt my phone vibrate on my bedside and I picked it up to see it was a message from Bridget. I shook my head as my heart sank. She texted me again. But what for? I read the message.

"Hey Laurence I'm checking on you to see if you were okay." Was what she texted me. Wiping my eyes, I texted back.

"Yeah. I'm fine." I gave her a short answer. When I'm upset with someone or don't want to be bothered, I give a short answer. Not even a minute later she responded. It was shown she read it the moment I sent her a text.

"Are you sure? I can tell something was wrong."

"Don't worry about me. What do you want?" I finally texted her. You can say I'm mean for this. But she did kinda break my heart. So, it's fair to me.

"If this is a bad time, I'll come back later to check on you. I just wanted to see if we could call."

"Bridget why don't you talk to one of our mutual friends? Like Abigail? She's female. Your talk could be something she can help you with."

"Listen, I just wanna talk to you. I've known you the longest and I feel more comfortable with you with what I need to get off my chest."

"Fine."

I was the first to press that call button. It was instagram ringing. 1 ring. 2 rings. Then that familiar sound of the other end picking up. There she was. As much as it hurt to see her, Bridget was still a very very gorgeous woman. She had occasionally changed her hair color but right now it was strawberry blonde. Her emerald eyes behind her cute glasses. It was like looking through one of those scopes that jewelers look through to see if a diamond was real. That's my comparison at least. Her precious face. But instead of her smile, it was her crying. I've only heard her cry once. This was the second time. She was panting and I just looked at her dumbfounded. See, I'm not great at expressing or processing my own emotions. It hurt a bit to see her cry.

"What's wrong Bridget?" I tried to sound sincere. But my own heart break over her was winning.

"He and I had broken up." She cried. I kept a straight face. In my mind, I wanted to tell her 'it sucked didn't it? To have your heart broken? Now you know how I felt' But no. I just nodded.

"I'm sorry. Is this what you wanted to call me about?" I asked her, sighing.

"I miss him so much. I wish things would go back to how they were."

That shattered me all over again and I trembled. Not just from hurt. But anger. Not because He left her. Screw that. She barely knew him for a year for what it seems and she's crying over him versus us knowing each other for 6 years and being together for 4 years? It was inconceivable. But then as she cried to me, babbling some of the same words, my heart stopped as I turned my head to look behind my desk. There was an arm wiggling like a snake. It was waving to me like a greeting and slowly peering out, was the shadow woman. Her head almost touched the ceiling, her own body casting like a real shadow. Her arms outstretched, she loomed over me and I felt myself shake again, like a seizure.

"Laurence?" Bridget calmed enough to get my attention. "Laurence? Hey.... What's going on?"

I couldn't move. Couldn't answer her. My body had its attention towards the shadow woman. Her head rotated slowly but in a taunting manner too. There was nobody to help me. I could see her step out of the wall and walk towards the foot of my bed, becoming 3 dimensional. Her claws on my sheets, leaving visible claw marks. My eyes glued to her, I started sweating and trembling, gasping for air but nothing coming in or out.

"OH MY GOD LAURENCE!" Bridget screamed. This was loud enough for my brother whose room was across mine to barge in and stare in shock. Could it be He's actually seeing this?

"DAD! LAURENCE IS SEIZING AGAIN!" He yelled.

"Eli is that you?!" Bridget yelled. "TELL ME THAT LAURENCE IS OKAY!"

Eli couldn't move. I think He was finally seeing something that I was trying to explain. Dad ran upstairs to my room and stopped at the doorway too. He saw her too. Everyone was at the doorway. The woman was silent as a mouse as she climbed onto my bed on her knees.

"GET AWAY FROM HIM!" My brother yelled, running to tackle the woman who fell out the window, my brother clinging onto the window. My Dad rushed in to grab his hand and pull him up while all I could do was sit there in terror. I was too afraid.

The woman got up slowly and cracked her neck back in place as I saw 2 more white eyes. No... 4... 6 total. The munchkin and the one who impersonated my brother. Both the extras from my nightmare. No... Not a nightmare... A precognition... Only this time instead of in the forest, in my own home.

"Laurence come on we gotta get out!" Allison yelled, trying to pull me out. I couldn't. Fear had taken over. "PLEASE! THEY'RE COMING!"

It was too late. They had made their way upstairs and the doorway. My 2 jack russel mixes were too afraid. Too shocked. These creatures scared them this much too. The munchkin grabbed onto my Sister while the bigger one pinned my brother and Dad to the wall. The woman walked towards me and impaled my arms with her claws, she stared into my face and slowly opened her mouth. She was grinning at the same time. I had enough cognitive to fear my end was here. But then.... There was barking. My dogs had sensed me being harmed and they ran upstairs to confront the shapes. The boy bit down on the big shape holding my brother and Dad while the girl bit onto the munchkin, pulling what seemed to be skin. But misty black. Both figures released my family and were trying to shake my dogs off.

"No more...." The female figure whispered hauntingly and grew teeth, biting onto my face.

"LAURENCE!" My family screamed. I could have sworn my life was flashing before my eyes. All hope seemed lost. I felt her needle-like teeth scraping and slowly digging into my flesh. I knew I bled cause it was warm and wet. I thought I was done. But there was a sound that made her take her mouth off my head and stare at my face. My eyes turned enough to see a bright light. It was fluffy and had bright green eyes as well as a gold shine to it and the shape meowed.

"C-carl..." I stuttered. It was my first words since the paralysis. My buddy had his shape and fluff he had the day my late Mom brought him home. He meowed again and trotted to the bed, jumping up and staring the creature down. "Buddy...."

He stared the creature down and I could've sworn I saw flakes of her peel away and disintegrate. She let out a very loud deafening scratch as she swiped out at him only to find her body burning from his pure energy. He let out a hiss and She screamed, exploding into a dark mist. The other two creatures also bursted, sharing a scream before it echoed. I looked at him and He looked up at me, nudging me. I felt a wave of security and love as I held him. My family couldn't see Carl but I could. My buddy then hopped off and I watched him walk the stairs to heaven. I let out a tear and muttered.

"Thank you..."

Once He had gone home to reunite with my late Mom, I was surrounded by my family. They held onto me.

"Laurence I'm so sorry..." Eli held me. "I thought you were overreacting."

I was at loss of words. No disappointment. Maybe... Maybe it was that those creatures made themselves visible to the real world when my emotions and anxiety got so bad that they could actually interact with me. But perhaps Carl knew what was there. I looked up where the stairs were and cried. Not of sadness. But joy. He had come to say goodbye and moved on.

Years later as I write this, I think back. On my very shelf, sat Carl's pawprint. I held on to it like a treasure. My siblings had moved out and I remained with my Dad and Stepmom and Stepmom's Mom. With their Dog as the addition to the family, 3 humans and 3 dogs as well as my recently bought 14 fish I call my children, I can say for sure those were my demons. Every one of my worries and thoughts manifested as figments of my imagination into reality. Realities that wanna do unspeakable things to me. To this day, I can see that shine that Carl had on the dogs and fish. Like Angels. Perhaps they were Angels to not only comfort me but love me like Carl did. In fact He was my miracle. Just as these beautiful creatures were. I thank God everyday for them.  


Guys, let me tell you it's okay to cry. It's okay to miss the deceased. But just know, as long as you accept they linger in your hearts, then they have never left. Don't let your demons win. And remember: Keep your family close.
