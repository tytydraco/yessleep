How do you explain to someone that a game can be haunted?



Sonic.EXE. Ben Drowned. Lavender town. All bullshit, right? Well, they are. I remember laughing about how goofy and campy they were with my older brother back in 2013. Bleeding red eyes, distorted models, the music making you sick. It was… stupid. But it was fun. Was.



I live near the town park, and every year there’s a big car boot sale where everyone gets rid of their old shit and gets a nice wad of change for it. Me and my brother used to go down there all the time. There was a guy who’d sell a ton of old, rare games and we fancied ourselves as the next Jontron or PBG or Caddicarus, so we’d buy them and hope for a shitty, rare game we could overreact to for 20 minutes for our 10 subscribers.



One year, I was 7. Way back in 2015. I remember it pretty clearly. My brother was looking over the old man’s NES games and found one that didn’t have a label. He held it up and laughed. “Hey! Chris! It’s a creepypasta!”. And I'd laugh. “Maybe it’s a haunted… Megaman! He’s firing blood, Lucas!” The old man didn’t understand. We’d apologise and explain. Haunted game creepypastas and the like. He didn’t get a word of it. He just shrugged. Said his son left these games behind when he moved out and he was getting rid of them all. 



I remember that day well. It was the last time I saw my brother as he was. Before.



He changed when he tried whatever that damn game was. Got jumpy, scared, standoffish. I kept asking him about it but he just shrugged everything off. Asked what the mystery game was and he kept saying it was broken.



Then, one day, he got sick.

Really sick. The kind that takes your hair, makes you look… skeletal.

Then, another day, I woke up to mom wailing, dad telling me to stay back, not to look in his room. I don’t remember that day quite as well, but that’s a good thing.



It… doesn’t hurt anymore. I think.



But recently, I remembered. His NES. the game we bought for it. The creepy one and how he changed after he played it. I remembered our time spent reading lame creepypastas over and over and I made two and two connect in my head. There was no way, right? How? How could a game actually be haunted?



I stood up in my chair, deciding to leave my homework for later, and headed down the hall, to his room. I didn’t go in frequently. 10 years, and it still stood as a frozen moment in time. Our old NES we played it on was still there. All his games, his amiibos, his figures. But the NES was important. I checked what was inside it, and I froze like I'd found a corpse.



It was the unlabelled cartridge. Still there after all this time. But it couldn’t be; he loved his NES, he’d never just stop playing it. Unless.



*Unless something scared him out of it.* 



I gripped the controller, prepared for whatever it was that did what it did to my brother. And? Nothing.



Blank screen. But I could tell there was some video signal, as the TV wasn’t telling me that I needed to connect anything. I sighed. Yeah, That was dumb. He must have just gotten sad, sick and died. I put the controller down and apologised. I didn’t know why, maybe it was to him. 



But then the TV flickered.



**SORRY.**



My blood froze.



It heard me. But, How? This was a normal NES. no microphone. But there it was. “SORRY” in all red caps on the tv screen, like-



*Like a bad creepypasta.*



I stood, still as a statue, as I stared at the machine’s message. Then it happened again.



**ARE YOU STILL THERE?**



I scrambled to unplug the NES. My breathing became unsteady, frantic. I felt like I was going to faint. I said, again, to nobody. “This isn’t real. You-You aren’t real!” as I gripped the plug in my hands and stared into the black abyss of the TV screen. “Just-Fuck off!” I spluttered.



**I CAN’T.**



I shuddered, looking down slowly at the unplugged wire in my hands. This is impossible. There’s no power to it. My mind raced a mile a minute as I tried to think. Then it hit me, the other wires, the video cable was still there. I reached around the back of the television, making sure not to touch the screen and found the adaptor. Without a second guess I yanked it out and doublechecked the screen. Nothing. The text was gone.



I stood in the room, clutching both wires and trying to control my breathing. Trying not to cry. Did this happen to Lucas? Did this kill my brother? I started to ruminate on that, my fear and grief turned into anger. I almost moved on my own, grabbing the haunted system and running outside to the trash cans.



I ripped the lid off and went to almost dunk the system in when I heard someone behind me.

“Hey, What’s that?”

I froze, like a character in a bad animated movie, then turned slowly to face whoever said that. It was my neighbour across the street. About my age, a shaggy looking skater kid looking dude who peered at me curiously beneath his brunette bangs and red beanie.

“Aw, sick, dude. Is that an NES?” he pointed to my hands “N-NO!” I yelped, then I gathered some composure.  “No. It’s… Busted.” This didn’t deter him. “I know a lot about tech, dude. I could fix it.” I shook my head. “There-There’s no fixing this.” The hippie looking guy didn’t seem even slightly put off, but he shrugged. “Alright, bro-migo, if you say so. Just would have been good content. Check me out on youtube, hey?” I put my hand up to get him to stop talking. “I-That’s okay, man.” He didn’t take the hint, but started walking off. “Spooky gaming, alright? Subscribe to me.”



I watched him like a hawk as he walked off, then I put the system into the trash and shut the lid. I looked at the trash can for a second. Weighing if I really should toss a memory of my brother, even if it was haunted. But, I couldn’t risk it, what if it came for me? For Mom? I wiped away the tears that started forming. “Sorry, Bro. I hope you understand.” I said, to nobody.



I slumped back into my room and lay on my bed. I stared at the ceiling as I tried to steady my breathing. Whatever the HELL that was, it was gone. The day was winding down already so I checked my phone. 10pm. Fuck it, best time to go the hell to bed.



I woke up again with a start, no nightmare, so whatever that was hadn’t done it to me.

I rubbed my eyes and got out of bed when I heard mom call for me. She looked concerned and tired, like she always did since Lucas died when she came into my room. “Chris, someone’s been in the trash.”



I lumbered down the stairs like I was nosferatu, stiff and fearful. “W-What, Ma?” My mother was staring out the window, perplexed and befuddled. “Someone…” She looked at me, closer. “Tipped our trash over.” I look outside and she’s right. “Maybe it was a racoon? I’ll clean it, ma.” She shook her head. “No, I saw someone running away. They had something in their arms. But- What would they want from our trash? Did you toss anything?”



My blood went cold.



“Ur-Ma, don’t worry about it. Probably some bum, alright? Sit down and have a cup of joe. The views on, watch that and I’ll clean the trash.” How my mom bought that, with me spluttering and going pale like I was bleeding from the tongue, I'll never know. But she smiled warmly and hugged me. “Thanks, Chris.”



I stumbled out the door like a classic zombie movie, then sprinted to the trash like a modern zombie movie. The NES was gone.



Fuck.



FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.



I felt myself breathe heavily, quickly turning into hyperventilating. That god-damned stupid fucking kid. He’d taken it anyway. He waited for me to go back inside. Why? WHY!? I remembered what happened to Lucas. How he began to rot. How his hair fell out. How quickly he died not even a week-



My brain stopped to a breakneck halt as I remembered. His youtube channel. Maybe he was a dumpster diver. Maybe he was gathering a big haul first. There was still time! I shoveled the trash back into the can and rose to my feet stiffly like Frankenstien. I opened the youtube app on my phone. 



“Spooky gaming.” I typed shakily. Being carried by autocorrect like an illiterate lunatic. The app loaded, then I saw it. A mediocre logo that looked slapped together in photoshop, a step above MS paint in red and black text. I shakily tapped the icon and my anxiety and fear turned into utter befuddlement. The first video’s thumbnail, a recommended video, was him, looking like he was trying to swallow a watermelon with how obnoxiously wide his mouth was, poorly green-screened over a screenshot of Sonic.EXE. The title was the most confusing. “THE CREEPIEST GAME YET!!”. Obnoxiously uniforming. I tapped the video, then swiped to shut it. What if this made me sick, like Lucas? What if- What if it got me?



I checked the upload date. Two weeks ago. Then braced myself. If it could affect me through the video, it clearly didn’t bother that kid much.



I weighed the risk, then tapped the video again.



The video loaded, then cut to an ad for Hershey's Chocolate. I cussed, then tapped the skip ad button the second I could. The first thing I saw was the kid, in a room that looked absolutely coated with Horror and gaming memorabilia. I could make out Link’s Master Sword, Jason’s Mask and poster for Grand Theft Auto V next to something that looked far less official for something called “Emesis Blue”. The kid was wearing his beanie and staring directly into the camera with a face that I could picture on a news reporter, happily reporting on a mass murder. Fitting, as he was opening with a story.



“So, basically, back in like, the nineties right? There was this dude called Patrick Grimley.” The editing of the video was as obnoxious as the thumbnail, cutting from an actual mugshot of a man I assumed to be Patrick to a cursor hitting the subscribe button. Subtle. Respectful. I rolled my eyes. “The dude had a wife and kid, right? They say his kid was an EPIC gamer and his dad was a total hardass about it.” There was an AI generated image of a kid, crying as a red faced man yelled at him. Why the hell this idiot thought a Pixar art style was even remotely appropriate for this was honestly astounding.



“The man drank hard, not partying but, like, a drunk.” the video cut back to his face, looking amused. “Not cool, dudes. According to the cops, he gets really mad one day, y’know? And his son’s just there, playing his SNES.” The video played a stock horror sound effect, then cut to a red waveform bouncing up and down to a hysterical woman. My stomach clenched.



I could hear angry shouting. Terrified screaming. Crashing. A woman. “HE’S HURTING MY BOY HE’S HURTING MY BOY PLEASE HELP ME SEND ANYONE” cutting out to a blood curdling screech as the shouting got louder.



Then it cut to a stock image of a broken controller. “He used his son’s own SNES. broke it over his head and just kept hitting him with it.” It sounded ridiculous. Something an angry step-dad would threaten you with but never do. He appeared back on the video, looking obnoxiously cheerful and holding a taped together SNES cartridge. “This, right here, is little Terry Grimley’s favourite game. In the SNES when he died and some say used to hit him harder.” He plucked at a loose bit of tape. “I think he did, this is fucked.”



His casual attitude about it kept rubbing me the wrong way. This was a nightmare. The mother, if she was alive and even still’s worst day. Why was he so chipper? Unless this was bullshit. I skipped ahead a bit, watching him and the AI slop he was flashing to explain what happened to the murderer dance about until it finally cut to gameplay.



The game in question was Super Mario World. As he put it. “A timeless classic. But, I was always more of a SEGA boy myself.” it cut off gameplay for the thousandth obnoxious zoom into his face. “They do what nintendon’t. Am I right?” I looked up from my phone, nobody else was on the street, so I sat on the thigh-high wall nearby. Standing gawking at my phone like a lunatic might gather attention.



The game finally came back on screen. For a moment it looked fine. The first level, I assumed, I'd never played the game. Me and this idiot had something in common, SEGA was way better. “Everything looks fine. World 1-1. Iconic, right?” Mario waddled forward through the level. There were no enemies. Now that I was properly scanning for anything out of order I realised there was no music either. The kid-idiot, I still had to work out what I was calling him, was giving a running commentary. “No goombas, nothing at all. Weird right?” He reached where there would be a Yoshi egg in no time.



“Alright, let's see what’s going on here.” he grinned at the camera. The egg wobbled like something was about to hatch. Then… nothing. The egg cracked open, but there wasn’t anything in there. The idiot boy guffawed like a donkey. “Wh-hey, no Yoshi! Ha! What the fuck? Wait- What’s this?” Mario skipped towards a sign, apparently, it wasn’t meant to be there if his surprise was anything to judge. He went to read it and a simple, esoteric message flickered on the screen.



“Nobody’s coming to help.”



The dipshit started whooping in amused fear, like how Markiplier or Pewdiepie would react to some monster in amnesia. “We’re getting into some creepy stuff, remember to smash that like button!” I gripped my phone tightly. He was so… OKAY with this. A day ago, I'd have written this off as some ARG. Mandela Catalogue with less sense. But… the red letters I saw on the TV when I started Lucas’s NES. The deep red SORRY.



Did haunted- creepy- whatever the fuck you could call them actually exist? Why weren’t they written about? What moron would waste time on hyper realistic bloody eyes when there were actual nightmares to worry about!? The video continued. His voiceover explained that there wasn’t much in the game aside from constantly missing enemies, items and Yoshis. Until it reached the end.



The music had suddenly cut back in, distorted and muddy like it was coming from a broken speaker. Mario wasn’t able to go any faster than a crawl. Bowser appeared, jittery and almost angrily. Then, the crescendo of the game-long buildup finally happened.

Bowser descended onto Mario, over and over like he was stomping on him. His idiotic laughter soared. The sprite of Mario started distorting, like it was being flattened. The text box came up again. The text was jittery and quickly coming apart as the sprite of Bowser sped up, as if it was hitting Mario faster.



D A D D Y  N O N O N O N O N O N O



The “No”s kept repeating. The dumb kid just stopped laughing. “Well, this is on the nose, boys!” a tier list popped up with an edited cursor and image sliding over it. “Think I'm gonna put this one in a… D. Not good, Sonic.EXE tier.” he reached over to the SNES and pulled the game out nonchalantly. “Well, that’s all it really has. It's a bit lame, but if you’re interested in me finding some spookier stuff, smash that like and subscribe button and remember-” He held up the game and shook it to the camera. “I bet Patrick would hit that bell!”



The video ended on his last attempt to piss on Terry’s grave.



I sat on the wall. Awestruck. What the FUCK was that?! I jumped from more pressing matters like him having an actual, from what I could tell, haunted game to the fact that the thumbnail and title was completely bullshit. That wasn’t scary, per se. But it was disturbing. I looked up and down the street. He had to live around here if he was just casually walking around to see me tossing the NES. I started scrolling his videos, maybe he had at least one video where he went out the house?



Some of the videos interested me, I think I partly wanted to make sure there was something he couldn’t fake or easily get online. One was a “lost prototype” of a game, apparently made by a developer who started killing children. I watched him laugh like an idiot as he kept feeding cake to a boy who kept making crying sounds and getting larger until a prompt to hit “E” popped up over the kid’s stomach. He tapped it dramatically and “The fat boy popped!” kept repeating on the screen as he made jokes comparing it to Se7en.



The next video was him playing Earthbound, Ness walked into his house to find his mother, faceless and bloody. There were hundreds of other Nesses who swarmed him as the game started glitching out. Another video had Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Tommy Vercetti kept walking, limping even, in a completely empty and colourless Vice City, a fog all over it like Rockstar and Konami made a really weird choice to set a GTA in Silent Hill. 



Tommy dropped to his knees in a more realistic fashion than the actual game for no reason and a grey “Release.” faded onto the screen rather than the typical “Wasted”. After that it was Final Fantasy 7, perfectly playable; but Cloud kept staring at the camera with hollow, empty eyes. All the dialogue was replaced with a name: “Harry.”



The kid, ever the complete fucking idiot, laughed and revealed that that was his name. I finally had something new to call him that wasn’t an insult. But a name didn’t help me find where he lived. I kept scrolling through video after video, trying to find anything where he went outside.



I found it, a haul video. Of course, he lived around here, he’d have probably gone to the car boot sale. The video loaded, and I got a glimpse of his front door as he was giving his trademark obnoxious intro. Red door; White fences as he walked down the street. I had a landmark to try and find him, I raised off the wall and started hunting.



I went block to block, trying to find his front door. After about 3 blocks I found a house that looked nearly identical to it. Red door, white fence. Bingo. I lurched to the front door and knocked like I was meant to be here. An older woman reeking of alcohol opened the door and brightened up like a literal cougar seeing prey.



“Ohh, hello there! Who dropped you off?” She leaned forward, I didn’t want to waste time. “Hey. Is Harry here?” She didn’t take the hint. “Are you one of my boy’s friends? He’s got a few of them, but I would have remembered you, I think.” I tried looking past her. “Yeah- Yeah I am, is he in?”



I think she finally got the hint that I wasn’t here to chat to her and leaned aside. “He’s in his bedroom, sweetie. Go on up.” I thanked her politely, pretended I didn’t notice her eyeing me as I speedwalked to the stairs and found a room with a large, moronic “GAMER AT WORK” poster on the door. It was just a hunch, but that was probably his room.



I opened the door, and heard the creak of his computer chair as he faced me. It was him, the kid I met yesterday. He took a second to recognise me, but by the time he had I had spoken first. “Where is the NES?”



Harry looked shocked, but tried to keep his cool like a politician trying to explain why he was on a flight log. “Uh-Wha-I dunno what you’re talking about.” I shut the door. “I’m not mad. But you need to give me that back. Alright?” Harry stood up slowly, hands up like I was pointing a gun at him. “Look, bro, I don’t know-” I stepped forward. He wasn’t older than me, not by a long shot. He looked like if Jesse Pinkman was still attending highschool and he’d inhaled more cannabis fumes than oxygen. 



“You don’t understand what that did, Alright? Give me it back. I’ve seen your little youtube-”

“Oh dang, did you sub?”“Shut-Shut the fuck up. Where is the NES?”

Harry deflated a little. “Look, bromigo. You were tossing it. That’s like- tossing out a holy grail.” I tried to keep my cool. “Look. that’s not like whatever shit you’ve been playing, alright? It’s hurt people. People close to me.” I pulled up a stool I assumed he was resting his legs on before I arrived and sat on it like a teacher asking a delinquent to stop swearing in my class. “I need it back, okay? Please. I’m asking for your sake too.”



Harry sighed. “‘Kay, dude. It’s by the CRT, in the corner.” He pointed. I picked it up and yanked the wires out. “But, I don’t think it hurt anyone, man.”



My blood went a little cold from anger. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.” I made for his door when he spoke again. “Nah, I do. These never hurt you.” I stopped. I got ready to shout, but his genuine concern stopped me. “...how do you know that, then? Since you’re the expert.” I said coldly.



“This shit is my fuckin’ jam, amigo.” he said, motioning to his room. “I’ve played hundreds of these creepy shits. Do I look bothered?” he said, reaching for a bong. I declined to comment, but the curiosity killed my cat and I asked. “Why do you do this to yourself?” He looked up from his bong, which I only then noticed was shaped like Pickle Rick. “What do you mean?” 



I mimicked him as I motioned around. “THIS. You’ve got a fucked up collection of haunted shit and you just… expose yourself to it, over and over. For views?” Harry grinned. “Average at least 100k, friend-o.” I shook my head and sat back down. “No, but- Does it not get… upsetting?”



Harry leaned back in thought, then answered. “Nah.”



We stared at each other, I waited for him to elaborate. “...How?” Harry shrugged, then remembered something. “Watch this.” he clicked on an icon on his desktop PC titled “VAMPIRE”. “This was the first thing I ever played, that was… creepy, y’dig?” I stared at him, my eyes flickering from him to his monitor. “It creeped me the fuck out too, but then I figured this would be one hell of a gimmick, right? Watch.”



The title screen for Vampire the Masquerade popped up on his computer. The music was low and deeper. “I thought my speakers were bust.” he said, with a chuckle. He clicked play, and the Male Tremere was standing in the middle of a bent, distorted map. The trademark source engine noises as the engine shuddered to life stuttered, but kept going after the Tremere started moving. 



He made it move towards a large, warped building and a sunken head of what I thought was Lacroix popped out, his eyes and teeth missing. They bit down on the Tremere and his model started freaking out, falling through the floor as an armless horde of the other player models started, weeping. A realistic scream bellowed out of the PC’s speakers.



I felt tense, my mind hadn’t quite figured out what I was watching. I was half expecting to hear Anomi’s voice to start feigning surprise. But what I was seeing was real. I looked back at Harry, he was massively incapable of making something like this. I watched the tremere’s arms disconnect without a sound as the screaming intensified.



Harry, as nonchalantly as he could, hit Alt+F4 and the game closed. A notepad document opened with “**MY ARMS**” repeating at least a thousand times. Harry didn’t even blink and closed that too. “That scared the shit out of me the first time, but then I figured I should show someone. One thing goes to another and…” He pointed to a framed award on his wall. A silver play button. I looked back at him and he gave yet another cheeky grin. “It’s a living.”



“Do you play… ANYTHING normally?” Harry nodded. “Yeah, My other games are fine. I can show you. I’m playing Malkavian right now-” I held my hand up. “But- I saw the Final Fantasy video. It knew your name.” Harry nodded. “Yeah, some of them say stuff like that. But as far as I know none of them can really hurt us.” he pointed to himself again. “Because if they COULD. I’d be dead as FUCK.”

I put my head in my hands. “So, they just say your name, personal stuff you can’t possibly know. And that doesn’t bother you?” Harry shrugged. “Not gonna lie, man. I played a fucked up copy of Minecraft that kept saying my mom was gonna die, I bet you saw that she’s fine.” I shook my head, trying to grasp what he just said. “But… How-” Harry leaned forward. Confidence seemingly found in my complete confusion. “Look, bro. What did the NES do?”



I looked down at the cursed system in my hands. The words died in my throat. “That’s… personal.” Harry crossed his arms over a Fortnite T-shirt, looking a little annoyed. “My crib’s personal, you busted into it. So what’s up? What’s wrong with the damn NES?” I clutched it a little harder.



“My… brother died.” Harry’s expression softened, I don’t think he was expecting that. “We found this game, it didn’t have a label on it.” I looked up and clarified. “At that big boot sale they do, up at the park?” Harry nodded. “I don’t know what it was, but not long after; he got sick. He died in weeks. I remembered the game yesterday. I turned the system on and… It spoke to me. Kept saying sorry, talking back when I spoke. I got scared, figured it must have done something to my brother. So, I tossed it.”



Harry sighed. “Shit, bro. I’m sorry. You should have said.” I shook my head. “Didn’t think you’d buy it.” Then I nudged my head to his PC. “Well, I guess I was wrong. You’re the only person who would.” Harry chuckled. “I gotta say, though. These games really can’t… hurt? You?” I looked up at him. “What do you mean?”



Harry motioned around him again, as if to reiterate his point. “Like, The minecraft. Told me Mom was gonna drown. There was a Village with a graveyard. Had a date on her grave and everything.” he leaned forward. “She’s Aquaphobic. She can handle a shower and wine, but she’d never go near enough water to drown. I think it was just… talking shit. The date she was meant to die was at least two years ago.”



He stuck a thumb towards his PC. Still whirring in an arrhythmic fashion. “This isn’t even my actual PC. Not the one I play on for funsies, anyhow. These games? Can’t even use bluetooth- Or wifi, whatever. This PC is haunted all to hell, but my other PC-” he wheeled out from behind his desk, revealing a much fancier model of a PC. “-Is just fine. Can play Vampire the masquerade fine, anyways.”



I looked down at the NES. Harry was living proof that this COULDN’T have hurt Lucas. But… the timing was something I couldn’t ignore either. Harry put his hand on the NES. “Look, I’ll test it. Alright?” my head snapped up. “No-” “It’s alright, bro. No blame if this does kill me, alright? You tried to stop me.” he slipped the NES from my hands with surprising ease. “Really, you begged. But I was just too damn excited for the views, ‘kay?”



He slipped the wires into the system of his CRT in the corner of his messy room and turned it on. “Dang. It’s on.”



The TV was held on the black mirror of the screen. Then.



**HELLO?** 



I shuddered. “Fuck, that’s it.” I stood up, putting my hand on his shoulder. “Turn it off, it’ll-” Harry turned around. “Wait.” I shook my head. “Please, I don’t want this to hurt someone else.” Harry put his hand on my shoulder, making us look a little silly. “You said this spoke back to you, right?”



I paused, then nodded yes. “Yeah- Yeah, it did.” Harry let go and turned back to the screen.



“Hey.” he said, as if he was greeting a friend. “You there?”



The tv flickered. **STILL HERE.** Harry snorted, like he was watching his cat fumble a jump.



“Did you hurt this guy’s brother?” I stuttered. “W-What? Hey, Don’t-”



**NO.**



I stood, still as a statue. “What?”



**I LOVED LUCAS.**



Neither of us said anything. Harry looked at me. “Lucky guy.”



**HE WAS MY FRIEND.** 



I nudged past Harry, kneeling in front of the CRT. I felt tears, but didn’t do anything to stop them. “He was my friend, too. I… I miss him.”



**I MISS HIM TOO.**



I shook my head, sprinkling tears. “Why was he scared? Before he died? What did you say to him?”**I DIDN’T MEAN TOO.**



I couldn’t believe I was even doing this. I put my hands up, as if I was placating a real person. “I-It’s okay, I don’t… blame you. Not anymore.”**I TOLD HIM HE WAS SICK.** 



Harry gasped a little in amusement. “Oh damn, They’re right sometimes!” He walked to the door and opened it a crack. “MA! Stay away from water!” I heard his mother reply with a quick, confused “Okay!” I put my hand over my mouth. “You were trying to help him, you knew he was sick before… any of us did. That’s why he was scared. He was worried.”



**I’M SORRY.**



I put my hand on the CRT, like I was comforting a child. “It’s okay. I’m- I’m sorry too.” I looked down at the NES, placed next to the TV. “I’ll take you home, okay? I’m sorry I tried to throw you out. I’m- Gonna unplug you now, is- is that okay?”

**THANK YOU.**



The terms were agreed too. I went to turn the NES off and unplug it. Crying openly. Harry, for once, chose to read the room and stay quiet. As I went to unplug it gently, he tapped me on the shoulder. I turned to see him trying to look comforting. “You, uh… Wanna play something? I feel like you could do something relaxing.” He looked to one of the two bookcases in his room. “I got… Mario Kart? I even downloaded the extra characters- And it’s normal, nobody bleeds.”



I stared at him, and then I started to laugh. He laughed too. I wiped at my eyes with my sleeve. 



“You know what? I’d love to.” Harry beamed. A new friend made, I sat on the stool and turned back to the TV. “Is that okay with you?” The TV flickered.



**YES.**



I nodded at the screen. “Thank you.” Then I turned to the monitor as Harry pulled a Switch out of a Zelda case and slotted it in.



The CRT flickered a little more, but I didn’t see it. Too focused on trying to nail Harry with a shell.



**TAKE CARE OF HIM, HARRY.**
