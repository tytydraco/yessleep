When I finished some work at the college campus I wasn't surprised to see that it was well past eleven pm, it was late and I needed to head home to get some rest for tomorrow. With tired feet I walked down the hall to the elevator on the north side of the campus. 

As I made my way to the elevator I passed the main stairs which were currently under repair after a project went wrong. Didn't get much of the details but I heard that apparently some of the students were working on a project and made a miscalculation which then created a hole down to the next floor. Luckily enough the people who were caught up in it only came out with minor injuries and they were back on campus within the next few days.

Turning the corner the elevator came into view, a piece of paper was stuck on to it by a single piece of tape and as I got closer I was able to make it out.

*Out of order, please use the emergency stairs or the other elevator.*

Just my luck. After some thought I decided that taking the stairs would be much quicker as the only other elevator was on the other side of the building. With a heavy sigh, I turned the handle and let the door slam shut behind me realising my mistake too late.

For some reason the lights didn't turn on. They were automatic lights  and should have turned on the moment the door opened or when I took the first few steps inside but none of the lights turned on. I was already here and had my phone with me with more than enough battery in it to light the path in front of me as I would make my way down to the ground floor. Step, step, step, the sound of my shoes hitting the stone beneath echoed loudly throughout the stairwell, the only sound that could be heard in here. 

Step, step, step, I made it past the second floor and soon as well past the first and finally I made it to the- what? I rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing things clearly. After all, I haven't been sleeping well for the past few days so I could be seeing things but right before me, as bright as the phone torch could show me, I was at the door to the third floor. Did I make a mistake, I thought to myself. Possibly imagining walking down the stairs without even doing so. I looked around and saw the stairs that I supposedly came from and the stairs that led downwards to what could only be the second floor.

Maybe, maybe I somehow imagined walking down those steps. So I walked down the stairs again going past the second, then the first and finally made it to the third floor. One more time? From third floor to second floor, second floor to first floor and first floor to third floor.

Going down the stairs was no longer an option, so I tried going up the stairs to see if I could make it to the rooftop, same problem. I tried opening one of the three doors and it led me to an identical staircase. I can't stay here. I need to get out. I need to get out now.

My phone's battery is running low, soon I’ll be trapped here alone in the darkness. I've been walking in here for probably hours and, seeing how things are going, will most likely never get out. With no reception to call for help or even so goodbye, all I could do was write on here to prove what had happened to me and tell my story.
