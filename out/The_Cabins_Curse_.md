I don’t have much time. My name is Nova Vale. I moved into a cabin not too long ago. The area is rural and rough, with trees as far as the eye can see. My nearest neighbor is probably an hour away. It’s after me, and I will never escape it. This is not what I wanted to happen.

On my first day here, I unpacked and settled in. The living room was dusty, and there were some leaves on the ground. I swept the living room and cleaned up spiderwebs that had gathered in the windows. There’s a fireplace on the left wall of the cabin. 

It’s strange—there’s this eerie painting of a woman above it. She has black hair, her skin is pale, and her eyes are so black it’s as if her iris and pupil were the same color. Whatever. The old owners must’ve left it here. I’ll call them soon to see if they can take it. I’m planning on putting my TV there. 

I cleaned up the fireplace and unpacked all my things: my couch, coffee table, and everything else. As I was walking up the stairs, I heard footsteps. There should be nobody else here. Whatever, I’m probably just hearing things. I walked left into the hall and finally reached my bedroom. I hauled the boxes that contained my bed and bedroom furniture up the stairs and assembled everything. Gosh, I’m tired. I’m going to get some sleep. As I fell asleep, I swear, for a split second, I saw someone in the doorway.

On my second day here, I woke up in the early hours. I heard loud bangs and knocks downstairs. I checked the clock—it was 4:27. Who the hell is knocking at this hour? I’ll just ignore it. I’m tired and I have a lot of work to do. I fell back asleep.

I woke up around 10:20 and walked downstairs to cook myself breakfast on the dirty stove. Ugh, I seriously need to clean this thing. I walked to where the dining table was supposed to be and realized, oh my gosh, I forgot to assemble it! Whatever. I walked to the couch and sat down. Wait. What the hell? Right in front of me was some ash on the ground. I cleaned up the fireplace—I never lit it back up. I probably stepped in some ash and didn’t even realize it. Right? 

Knock. Knock. Knock. My eyes darted straight to the door. Now what? KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. I walked to the door, and as I was about to open it, my stomach immediately sank. It’s not possible. I haven’t changed my mailing addresses or anything, but oh my gosh, what am I doing? It felt as if my body had a mind of its own. I opened the door. It was a woman. She was pale and had black eyes, almost as if her iris and pupil were the same color. She seemed familiar. “Uh, hello?” I uttered. 


Something about this wasn’t right. The woman didn’t say a thing. “Ma’am, are you lost? Is everything okay? Do I need to call for help?” I asked her. She began to develop a slight smirk on her face, which made me slightly shudder. The woman raised her hand and pointed behind her without looking. She pointed at a tree. 

Weird. She then put her hands down. “Don’t answer the door,” she said in a raspy voice. Is this woman okay? She had red marks on her neck, and she looked so thin. She walked away, and I shut the door, locking it behind me. 

I locked all the windows in the house, both downstairs and upstairs. I pulled up the curtains and closed them. I knew what this was. I grabbed water and food. I couldn’t let anyone else know I was here. I grabbed anything necessary, hauled it upstairs, and entered my room. I was shaking with fear. I closed and locked the door behind me. I could stay in here as long as I needed. I would be safe here, I thought.

On my third day here, the peace was broken. That woman, she seemed so familiar, like the woman in the painting. Oh my gosh. The footprints—those had to be hers, right? I haven’t been able to sleep. I don’t know for sure if something’s wrong… No, I do know. 

Nothing feels right. I haven’t left my room since yesterday’s events took place. I’m too terrified. I won’t speak, and I won’t move. As I’m writing this, I don’t think I have much time left. I’m shaking and trembling. That woman… that woman… that woman. Ever since I saw her and looked into her lifeless eyes, I have this nauseous feeling. I feel sick. I feel horrible. I cannot explain it. I’m going to call the man who sold me this cabin. No wonder it was so cheap. There’s something wrong, and I know it.

I dialed his number. Ring, ring, ring. “Hello, this is Jerry Frederick. Who am I speaking to?” a voice said on the other end of the line.

“Uh, hi, it’s Nova. You sold a cabin to me…” I said quietly.

“Ah, yes. Hello! Is there something wrong?” he asked.

“Yeah, actually there is. Before I tell you that, is there any bad history to these woods? I wouldn’t want to, uh, live in dangerous woods, you know,” I replied.

“Well, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you this before. I just needed to get rid of the cabin… FAST. You see, the woods there were owned by many women and men, but something otherworldly happened and the women began dying rapidly—suicides and murders. It’s a tragedy, really. A lot of the women’s spirits never found rest, so now people say they torment anyone who trespasses on their land. My wife, Mary, was a victim of the otherworldly massacre. I couldn’t stand the thought of her spirit never finding peace, so I just left. Honestly, I wish I had never done that. I’m sorry, Nova. I don’t think I will be returning. She won’t be at peace until she can take another soul with her. It won’t be me. I truly am sorry, Ms. Vale.” He explained.

Beep beep beep. He hung up. He hung up on me.

I can’t let her get to me. I shouldn’t have moved here. I’m leaving. It’s my third day, I know. But I am leaving.

It’s my fourth day here. I couldn’t sleep at all. I shouldn’t have talked to that woman. I’m hearing scratches at my window and loud banging. I know she will find a way in soon, and when she does, she will take me with her. Bang. Bang. Bang. I know it’s her, banging at the door. I know she wants her rest and I know she will do anything to get it. 

Pit. Pat. Pit. Pat. I know she has gotten inside and I know she will find me soon. I hear her walking up the stairs. My time has come. She will be here soon enough. I should have never moved here, and I should have never answered the door.

Creak. Creak. Creak. It’s 4:25 a.m. She will find me soon enough. I’m trembling and shaking while I’m writing this. My door is locked, but I know. I know she will find a way in. 

It’s 4:26 a.m. Pit. Pat. Pit. Pat. She has stopped outside my door. I’m trying to be as quiet as I can be. There is no difference, because I know. I know she will find me. 

It’s 4:27 a.m. BANG BANG BANG. RATTLE RATTLE RATTLE. The door creaks open slowly. The figure of a thin-looking woman stands in the doorway.
