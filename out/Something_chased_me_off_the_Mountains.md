This incident took place 3 years ago on the white mountains In New Hampshire. I was on a camping trip with a group of buddies of mine for stories sake we will call them Mark , Max , and Kate and yours truly. After hiking a bit we finally found a decent spot to set up home for the day and nothing seemed off about the area other then we did notice a couple of tracks and animal paths but decided they weren’t a concern they didn’t look fresh.After we finish setting everything up we decided to stay up late into the night. Now this next part is important sitting to my right is Kate sitting in front of me is Mark and Max to his left in between is our table with out radio. Now behind Mark and max is a steepish hill leading deeper into the forest and behind Me and Kate is nothing but woods and trees but not very dense you could clearly see anything walking to you. The way we are seated I can see the hill behind them and they could see the forest behind me. My jeep that we used on the trails is parked off the trail but still a bit decent distant away. It’s around 1 am and we are just sitting by the fire and listening to music usual camping stuff not to concerned about the noise since there’s no one around we need to worry about anyway at some point I start feeling like we are being watched but I can’t figure out why so I take my flashlight and look towards the forest but I couldn’t see anything. Kate looks at me and asks me “Did you see anything? I didn’t see anything “ I tell her I didn’t see anything and so the night continues. 

 At some point I look over to my right just passed Kate and I could’ve sworn I saw something over there something small I ignore it and ultimately decided it might’ve been a small animal or something. When all of a sudden what from sounds like not even 5 feet away I hear something charging at me like full on sprint on dry grass. I immediately look over to Kate and I can see on her face that  she hears it to so my body immediately fills with adrenaline as I shoot up and turn around to see…….. absolutely nothing. Not a thing.

 At this point both Mark and Max are up as well asking me wtf ????. I quickly tell them “ I just fucking heard something running at me “ and that “ I’m not fucking with you “ we immediately throw more wood on the fire the get fire big the whole time we are yelling and screaming into the woods cause at this point we are thinking it might be a bear or something. We start hearing noises coming from the hill and I get freaked out because there is no way whatever this was could get around us like that and not be seen.

We decided fuck this and we started just hauling ass out of there . Mark was working on putting out the fire while we started leaving. As we started leaving I pointed my light towards the noise on the hill and behind a boulder I can see a pair of white eyes reflecting on the light and the movement it made will always stick with me because it moved down and to the left almost like it tried to hide and get a better look. That’s when i said “fuck this “ and started booking it . Once we got to the jeep and started to drive away I can hear out my window what sounds like something charging right at us I can hear twig snapping and grass crunching. I floored it after that mind you this was a trail not a road so I flew down the trail and left the forest and got off the mountain. We did leave all our stuff behind. The whole drive out of the forest it really felt like something was following us right until we got off the mountain.

 I’ve dealt with bears before this was not a bear you can’t even hear a bear walking. This sounded like a person running and the running sounded very pronounced on the grass and twigs. I’ve always done Urban exploring and going to haunted places but nothing ever made me feel as horrified as I did that night and I haven’t been back camping on the mountains since . From what I saw and heard there is no way this was an animal. Whatever it was it did not want us there.
