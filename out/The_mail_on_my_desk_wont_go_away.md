“Need help?” My wife asked, peering over my shoulder.

“No, thanks.” I blew her a kiss and turned back to my computer.

I winced at the stack of mail beside me. It’d been collecting there for weeks.

*Why can’t I go through it? It’d take me five minutes. Just do it!*

The truth was I’d been delaying. No matter how hard I tried, there was something about digging through that pile. There was an anxious, painful feeling that told me if I got started… it’d never end.

“Are you sure you don’t want help?” My wife asked again.

“No, sweetie. You go play with Cadence and rest. I’ll sort through it later. I promise.”

Later came and I reached for the first envelope. That sick feeling came over me. *Oh god…*

I doubled over and gripped my stomach. It was like my body was having an adverse reaction to even touching the mail. *What’s going on?*

I decided to text my friend, who did clinical work.

“Can you advise me on something?”

“Sure, bud.”

I told him about my issue and he texted back: “Sounds like your procrastination is causing stress. Set aside some time this week and do it then. No matter what.”

His suggestion was overly simple, but I didn’t have any other ideas, so I showered that night and decided: *Who cares if I’m miserable? If I don’t get this done, my wife’ll kill me.*

I stepped out and wrapped a towel around my waist and made my way to the office. But when I yanked open the door and entered, I saw something unexplainable…

It was about six feet tall and wore a long, torn cloak. It had charred skin and bone-white eyes. At first I thought it was an old woman.

“H-hello?”

The thing didn’t even acknowledge me as it stacked envelopes on my desk.

“Wh-what are you doing?”

It didn’t respond.

“Listen… if you don’t leave, I’m calling the police.”

The frail entity locked eyes with me and said, “Don’t.”

*Don’t.* The word thundered in my brain like a cymbal being struck by a hammer.

I swallowed my fear and felt every ounce of strength seep out of me.

The creature continued its meticulous organization, taking extreme caution to arrange each letter so that the piles wouldn’t collapse.

“Please… whatever you are… just leave…”

The figure studied me with a merciless gaze. It was a hollow expression that seemed devoid of all hope.

“David!” My wife called from the kitchen. “Can you change Cadence’s diaper?”

“Y-yes, honey… give me a minute…” I struggled to maintain my composure. “Wh-what are you?”

The creature positioned itself over my computer and vomited a wet stream of envelopes. It was like watching a mound of sardines explode from a whale’s belly.

I covered my nose and recoiled from the smell. The sudden urge to empty my own stomach rose within me, but I refrained.

The figure wiped the bile from its lips and extended a rotten finger toward me…

“Don’t.”

The next morning, there were even more envelopes on my computer. In my cabinets. On the floor.

Everywhere I turned there were slimy letters, muck-covered bills, and sticky envelopes.

“What on earth is going on?!” My wife asked, trembling.

I wanted to explain everything I had seen the night before. But how could I?

Our entire house was filled with the disgusting mail. Even our daughter’s room had slimy letters stuck to the wall.

My wife and I spent the entire morning disposing of it.

When we were finally finished, I stepped outside for a moment of fresh air.

Right then I happened to see the post car drive by. The carrier in the driver’s seat turned and waved to me.

They were too far to hear but I swear I could read their lips. It was almost like they were saying…

“Don’t.”
