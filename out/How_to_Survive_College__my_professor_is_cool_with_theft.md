I am not a fan of [having the steam tunnels closed off to us](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/195erdi/how_to_survive_college_so_much_for_the_steam/).  We didn’t use them that often, considering they’re not exactly safe, what with the whole steam ghost thing and also that little problem of doors opening to random… places.  However, it’s quite handy to have around in the case of an emergency.  Like, say, when it starts raining unexpectedly.  Which is a lot.  Even more than usual, I feel.

I think the weather forecaster for our area has given up.  They seem completely unable to predict the rain anymore.

Or maybe they’re under the control of the administration… whatever that looks like.

Mmmm paranoia, my fav.

Grayson visited the apartment for the first time shortly after the incident in the library.  I felt bad inviting him almost as soon as he showed up.  He looked so tired.  I put on some water for tea and gently asked if everything was okay.  He was over in the living room and I heard him slide the devil-box once more out of the middle of the floor.

“There’s just a lot to do,” he sighed.  “Honestly, I’m not ready for this to be my last year.  I felt like I’d be further ahead or better prepared… but there’s been some stuff come up.”

I’m sure killing the flickering man didn’t help any.  He was keeping the inhuman things in line, after all.  Not to mention watching over Grayson’s dad, who I could only assume continued to deteriorate.  I wondered how much of Grayson feeling unprepared to leave the university was related to his dad.  It must be hard being an only child.  I’ve got my siblings and I know that once we’re all grown, if something happens to mom, it won’t be up to any one of us alone to take care of her.

“Can’t the university do anything?” I asked.  “I know you try to keep it quiet, but surely being the son of the president can come in handy for *something*.”

He laughed without any real humor in it.  He was at the entrance to the kitchen now and I saw him glance around in the corner of my eye.  His face seemed sharp and lean.  Like he’d lost weight over the summer, and not in the ‘shed a few unnecessary pounds’ kind of way, either.  I shoved the tea at him and started hunting through the pantry to see if I had any snacks to feed him.  Unfortunately, both Cassie and I lack both excess money and entertaining skills, so I had to settle on poptarts.  It was either that or ramen.

“Where’s your cat?” he asked as he sat down at the table.

I’m proud of the table.  Mom found it when she went into the neighboring town for some things we don’t have in our general store.  There was a chain restaurant remodeling and it was selling off its old furniture, so she bought one of those 2-person heavy-duty fast food tables along with two chairs for like… $30.  I’m pretty sure this thing will outlast the apocalypse.

“Probably on Cassie’s bed.  By the way, have you been in the steam tunnels lately?”

He shook his head.  Ever since his encounter with the ghost down there he was rather reluctant to go into them by himself.  He didn’t even particularly want to go inside them with other people.  Also, there wasn’t a reason for him to.

“I’m not as worried about the rain as everyone else,” he said quietly, staring at the steam wafting from the tea.  “The creatures in the rain don’t bother me.  Privilege of my position.”

That’s right.  I saw him order around that creature that had been after Cassie, after all.  I asked how far that authority extended.  If he was safe from *everything* on campus.  I’ve asked this before and he didn’t answer and I didn’t press him but maybe enough time had passed that he’d be willing to talk about it.  I tried to look casual about it, like I wasn’t *dying* inside to know the answer, and I think I failed entirely because he laughed softly.

“Safe?” he said.  “From everything?  Hardly.  Remember the steam ghost?”

Oh.  Yeah.  I felt dumb.

“But the things out in the rain,” he continued.  “They’re not a problem for me.  The ones I know about, at least.”

“Including the traveling river?  It’s an occurrence, after all, and can’t distinguish who you are, right?”

He glanced up at me sharply and the overhead kitchen light cast deep shadows around his eyes.

“What makes you think it isn’t intelligent?” he asked softly.

That certainly gave me pause.  I floundered for a moment, not sure what to say to that, and then Grayson asked if he could see the piece of petrified wood I had.

Yeah I did tell him about that.  I figured I could use his advice on how to get it back to its owner.  No, I still have no idea how it wound up in my things.  But it did, I have it now, and it’s up to me to get it back to Professor L.  I took him into the living room, covertly sliding the devil-box back out of the middle of the room before he entered.  I had the stone on the coffee table, alongside the book I’d gotten from the library.  Grayson sat down at the sofa and stared intently at the stone while I found a coaster for his half-finished tea.

Having your own place is hard, I’m realizing.  There’s so much you need that you don’t think about in advance.

“Here,” I said, picking up the stone once we were settled.

I held it out to him.  He hesitated a moment before stretching out a palm for me to drop the stone into.  He rolled it between his palms, juggling it between them for a moment like he was holding something hot, then finally let it settle and rest still there in his cupped hands.

“It doesn’t look like a heart at all,” he finally said.

“Turn it over and squint.”

He did and frowned, clearly agreeing with my assessment that the professor was stretching the definition of a heart.

“I think I’m going to stuff it in his mailbox to return it,” I said.  “I can’t think of a plausible excuse as to why I would have it and I can’t lie very well anyway, so I’m just going to go the anonymous route.”

“I shouldn’t be suggesting this,” he said, “but don’t you need this a bit more than he does?”

I won’t deny it - keeping it has crossed my mind.  I’m sure some of you have been thinking the same thing.  We certainly had some good justifications.  I was neck-deep in the inhuman world right now and even though we’d removed the flickering man, I was still highly visible to everything on campus.  However, I’m not comfortable keeping it.  It doesn’t belong to me and out of everyone that isn’t Grayson, I’m probably the best prepared to deal with these things.

Please ignore the fact that my panic response is to freeze.  I’m finding ways to circumvent that.

Cassie… well, Cassie… okay, we need to talk about Cassie, don’t we?  I’ve been putting it off too long.  She’s come to terms with forgetting her former roommate a lot faster than I expected.  I asked about that and she was like, well, I don’t *have* those feelings for her anymore.  Instead, she just has feelings about having forgotten and once the shock of that wore off, she found it was more a vague sense of unease than anything genuinely upsetting.  Like forgetting someone you went to school a long time ago.  It’s unsettling that your memory can fail you like that, but that’s all.

And interestingly, forgetting about her roommate also took away a lot of her fear about the monsters on campus.  I don’t think it’s entirely unwarranted.  With her memories about Sarah gone, she’s not as tasty a target for the forgetter.

(blah blah blah you’re not supposed to name them I KNOW but I’m not calling it ‘creepy finger guy’)

Anyway, Cassie doesn’t feel she needs protection anymore.  We don’t live on campus.  She’s scheduled big blocks of time between her classes so she can wait out the rain if she needs to.  She’s adopted a strict ‘we don’t talk about the inhumans on campus’ policy to avoid attracting its attention again.  (no idea if that’ll work)  But with all these precautions, I think if I offered her the stone she’d refuse on the grounds it was accidentally stolen.

Maria would likely feel the same.  And she’s probably on par with Cassie in terms of being able to deal with inhuman things.  So no, I don’t have a good excuse to keep the stone.  And that’s the gist of what I told Grayson.

“What about identifying it?” he asked.

“I can take photos from every angle.  That’ll be enough.”

“Didn’t you say that some rocks you identify by taste?”

“Ye-es, but I know what kind of rock that is already.  I’m trying to figure out what kind of tree it is now.  I don’t need to lick it.”

He carefully set it down on the coffee table.

“Well, do what you think is best,” he said.  “I’m not sure how to proceed from here, honestly.  Thanks for letting me see it before you return it, though.”

Then he said he had to go, as he had to get to class.  I escorted him to the door.  He glanced behind him just before he left.  His eyes narrowed in confusion.  I looked back to see what he was staring at and there it was, the devil-box was back in the middle of the living room, because *of course* it was.

I hastily pulled a ‘itwasgreatseeingyoubyeeeeee’ and hustled him the rest of the way out the door.  Okay, yes, it’s not great that I’m keeping secrets from Grayson.  I did the same thing to Cassie and almost destroyed our friendship but I *really* don’t want to explain I made a bargain with the devil to anyone I don’t absolutely need to.  Besides, I’m allowed to keep some things to myself, I feel.  I don’t have to be an open book.  It’s not like Grayson and I are super serious about our relationship right now.  I’m not even sure if it’ll survive after he graduates and leaves me behind.  He might move to the other side of the country for all I know.  So I’m not required to share everything with him yet, right?

Actually please don’t answer that I can’t handle it right now.

After Grayson left, I set the stone on the kitchen table and took photos of it from every angle, like I said I would.  The conversation with Grayson convinced me.  It was time to return it.  Ngl I was pretty nervous about waltzing into the geology room and just… dropping it off… but the mailboxes were at the very end of the hallway and it was the side hallway with the offices so it was sparsely traveled anyway.  I didn’t have to worry about the stabbed student even, not with the stone on me.

Well, at least on the way in.

As it turns out, it wasn’t the stabbed student I had to worry about.

The stone doesn’t make someone invisible to the inhuman.  My theory is that it works like a dampener.  Makes you less… connected.  The inhuman world is less likely to notice you because you’re further away from them.  Someone like me, who grew up around the inhuman, well.  It’s probably a lot harder to hide from them.

That’s my best explanation for what happened on my way to the geology building.

I had high hopes, as it was a sunny day and the handful of clouds in the sky were pure white.  Not a hint of rain on the horizon.  Granted, that could change despite what the weather forecast said, but the rain doesn’t at least *completely* defy the laws of nature.  It’d take a little time for the rainstorms to move in and this was going to be a short errand.  Getting the stone back to the geology building and getting back off campus was looking like a simple mission.

I felt a prickling on the back of my neck as I walked past the English building.  At first I dismissed it as nerves.  That was the building that housed the thing in the hallway, after all, and the few encounters I’d had with it are enough to last my lifetime, thanksverymuch.  However, the feeling persisted even after the building was out of sight.  I glanced around, noting that I was far from alone.  There were plenty of students around me.

So why did I feel like I was being watched?  I wrapped my fingers around the stone in my pocket uneasily.

Finally, I decided to step off the path and look around.  I didn’t even try to act casual.  If anyone asked, I’d say I was trying to figure out the best angle for some photography assignment of architecture or something.  Not that anyone would ask.  This is college.  People do weird stuff all the time and no one cares.  So I stood on the grass and scanned first the sidewalks and the students that were also loitering on the grass.  Nothing stood out to me.  No one else had stepped off the pathway to awkwardly wait for me to get moving again and everyone on the sidewalk was continuing on to their destination.

For a moment I wondered if I was just imagining it.  It’s a reasonable concern.  I’m a little jumpy with everything that’s happened.

Then I raised my gaze and searched the sides of the buildings around me.

My thought was that something was watching me through a window.  I wasn’t really looking at the buildings themselves, more at the windows.  I only saw it because it moved.

There.  Flattened against the side of a nearby building, its skin patterned to resemble the brick around it.  Its limbs were spread out in a strange parody of a frog, perfectly human in form, but splayed and clinging to the vertical surface with those long fingers.  Its head swiveled gently and when I stared at it, it jerked its gaze back to meet mine.

I saw it and now it could see me.  The stone wasn’t enough to hide me from its awareness.

Tentatively, I stepped back on the sidewalk and resumed walking.  After a few paces I paused and turned around.

It had moved forward.

It was following me.

I broke into a faster walk.  This time, when I turned around, I could no longer spot it.  It had moved enough from its original position that I was no longer sure where it was and I was having trouble finding it again.  Like a game of hide and seek, except the hider has camouflage and wants to eat my memories.

Hadn’t Grayson warned it off?  Was he losing control of campus now that the flickering man was gone?

Did he have as much control as he thought he did to begin with?

I no longer felt that confident about walking into an empty building.  I needed to return the stone without being seen, but I also didn’t want to get cornered by that thing.

I paused outside the entrance to the geology building and took a few deep breaths to compose myself.  I had to think this through.  I knew I was competent and able to do this - I just needed a plan.

As soon as I was inside the lobby, I took my water bottle out of my bag and balanced it on the handle of the door.  It’d fall as soon as anyone tried to open it.  If it were a student, I’d likely hear them yell with surprise or curse or something.  If it was the creature, I’d hear it fall and nothing else.  That would tell me if I needed to abort my plan or not.  There were classes going on right now.  I knew the geology professors well enough that I felt I could burst into the room crying that I’d seen the ghost and convince them to let me stay in the back of the classroom until class let out and I had people to walk out with.

Then I waited around the corner, heart pounding.

Silence.

I had to convince myself to move.  It wasn’t following me inside.  I had a warning now and a backup plan of finding safety in a classroom.  I could do this.  Reluctantly, I peeled myself away from the wall and started down the hallway towards the staff mailboxes.  I noted which office doors were shut with their lights on, just in case I couldn’t get to a classroom and had to resort to bothering a professor.

I made it halfway down the hallway before I saw that the creature was still following me.  I almost screamed, but this is me, I freeze, and the sound was strangled in my throat.

It was plastered against the window.  Its fingertips suctioned to the glass like a frog and its face - gray-blue to blend in with the sky above - was pressed against the pane.  Its eyes bulged out of its skull, wet against the glass, and its cheeks were spread out in saggy balloons, like putty being pushed into too small of a container.

The panic response in my brain short-circuited and my legs stopped moving.  I stared at it in horror, watching as a lump in its throat bobbled up and down, like it was trying to speak.  It wasn’t inside, a voice repeated wildly in the back of my head.  It was outside.  I was inside.  *It couldn’t get to me*.

I stumbled backwards, away from the window and towards the far end of the hallway.  I didn’t dare take my eyes off it.  Because if I did, what if it went around, what if I heard the water bottle fall, what if it was in the building with me?  I walked backwards, staring resolutely at the creature, and its eyes - still pressed against the glass - shifted so that the pupils continued to track me.

I made it to the mailboxes, where I quickly located Professor L’s name and shoved the stone inside.  My heart was pounding so loudly I almost couldn’t hear anything else.

Almost.

“What are you doing?” a voice asked from behind me.

This time I didn’t freeze.  I basically jumped out of my skin.  Screamed and everything.  So that wasn’t suspicious as hell *at all*.  I whipped around and found Professor Monotone standing behind me.  How had he snuck up on me so quietly?

“Just dropping something off,” I said hastily, totally sounding guilty as hell.

And sure enough, the professor craned his neck to see what was behind me and there was the stone in Professor L’s mailbox.

“Oh, you found it.”

I shifted aside as he reached for it.  He pulled it out of the cubby and turned it over in one hand.

“It’s not even that great of a specimen,” he said casually.  “Doesn’t look like a heart at all.”

“Right?” I laughed.  “Anyway, I found it on a classroom shelf and thought I’d better get it back to him.”

Then Professor Monotone did something unexpected.  He shoved the stone at me and his face, normally distracted by whatever ponderous thoughts were drifting through his head, sharpened to a hawkish intensity.

“You should hang onto it instead,” he said.  “You can return it when you graduate.”

I stared at him stupidly for a moment, not really comprehending what he was saying.  Was a professor telling me to *steal* from someone?

“But what about Professor L.?” I finally asked.

“I’ll keep an eye on him.  He’ll be fine.  Besides, it’s about time he learns to deal with these things if he’s going to be a professor here - or anywhere, really - long-term.”

Oh.  My.  God.

*Every campus has inhuman creatures.*

(though I’m not sure why we’d be surprised by this, with as densely packed as they are with all those ideas and stories and traditions flowing around the student body)

But also.

Professor Monotone apparently knows a *HELL OF A LOT MORE* than he’s let on so far.

I wanted to ask him so many things, but he just winked at me and offered to escort me back to the front entrance.  Then he handed me my water bottle that I’d left stuck in the front door handle (!!!!!!???) and said that he’d hate to lose a promising student over something as silly as property ownership.

And that his office is always open for me.

Time to show up with a list of questions and it’s not just going to be about the mechanisms of crustal growth. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
