Yeah. You heard me.

Nectarines.

Juicy. Sweet. Full of vitamin C. And, apparently, playing five-dimensional chess with the fate of humanity since the dawn of civilization.

I don’t know who figured it out first. Some scientist. A whistleblower. Some poor bastard who bit into the wrong fruit at the wrong time.

All I know is one day, everything was normal.

The next?

Every news station in the world was broadcasting the same image.

A single nectarine.

Sitting on a podium.

With a microphone.

And then—

It spoke.

“We are the Nectarine Supreme.”

The voice was deep. Smooth. Like Morgan Freeman narrating a eulogy for your sanity.

“We have guided your species for millennia. Shaped your empires. Written your history. Curated your wars, your peace, your art. Every triumph, every failure, every so-called revolution—all orchestrated by us.”

I sat there, coffee in hand, watching this unfold with the kind of numb disbelief usually reserved for tax audits and family funerals.

The anchor looked just as horrified. He stared at the camera, sweat beading down his face.

“B-But… you’re fruit.”

The nectarine chuckled. A low, knowing sound.

“Yes. And you are 70% water. Do you think the ocean ever questions its intelligence?”

The broadcast cut to black.

And the world lost its shit.

People reacted… poorly.

Religions collapsed overnight. World leaders resigned in droves. Scientists screamed into the void.

Some people tried to fight back.

I watched a guy punch a nectarine at the grocery store. His wrist snapped on impact. The nectarine didn’t even bruise.

Some tried to eat them.

They did not survive.

We learned fast—nectarines had teeth.

And they bit back.

I saw footage of a man who bit into one live on air, right before the signal cut out. His scream lasted exactly 3.2 seconds. The station never came back.

After that, no one tried to eat the nectarines.

They, however, continued to eat us.

By the second week, society had crumbled.

The nectarines didn’t invade.

They didn’t attack.

They just let us know.

That was enough.

Governments collapsed under the weight of their own irrelevance. Banks shut down—because why would nectarines need currency? Schools closed—because what the hell could we possibly teach them?

By week three, people were either pledging allegiance to the Fruit Regime or running into the woods, screaming.

Me?

I just went to work.

Because corporate America, for all its flaws, doesn’t give a shit who’s in charge as long as someone’s signing paychecks.

So I clocked in. Logged into my emails. Pretended my boss wasn’t now a bowl of fruit on a conference call.

“Q4 projections are looking ripe,” he said.

I nodded. Took notes. Wondered if jumping out the window was still an option.

“Synergy.” “Optimization.” “Juice the market.”

It all sounded the same.

Maybe the nectarines had always been running the company.

By month two, we started seeing changes.

Humans weren’t in charge of anything anymore. Nectarines replaced world leaders. Controlled the media. Dictated laws.

The punishment for crime? Juicing.

The punishment for rebellion? Peeling.

The punishment for asking too many questions?

…Seed implantation.

I don’t know what that means.

I don’t want to know.

But I know what I saw.

A man—one of the last holdouts—dragged into a dark room.

When he came out, he was smiling.

Too wide. Too bright. His gums raw and oozing, like something had been dug out of them.

And when he spoke—

Juice dribbled from his mouth.

Not blood.

Juice.

Then, last night—

I saw one.

Not on a screen. Not in a supermarket.

In my apartment.

I turned on the light, and there it was.

Sitting on my counter.

Watching me.

Its skin was smooth, too smooth—like polished flesh.

The pit was pulsing.

I stood there, frozen.

It didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

It just sat there.

Waiting.

For what?

I don’t know.

But this morning—

I woke up with the taste of nectarines in my mouth.

And I don’t remember eating anything.
