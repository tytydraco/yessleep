**A Norwegian mans tale- "Another me"**

the summer of 1996 my Family had rented one part of summer-house in Sweden. We stayed there for 10 days. It was a large yellow 1 floor house, that was basically devided right Down the middle for the other part of the house, With entrances on each side. It was in a very secluded area covered by Wood on one side and a road and trail Down towards a Beach and store on the other, With a huge front-lawn we played Soccer and stuff on. 



We didnt see any other kids around that Place, unless we went Down to the Beach area so i either played With myself alone or With my little sister. Being the Explorer i was, one day i found a set of keys that was hidden under the welcome matress, and it didnt long for me to figure out one of the keys was to the other side of the house we were renting. Discretely i locked myself in at a time my parents and sister was busy doing something i found boring i Guess. It was very different from the part of the house we rented. Techicnally speaking it as just a mirror-Version room-wise, but it had practically no Furniture, no vibrant colors, and practially nothing there, i dont remember a fridge, washing machine or anything. It was more or less just Space, except for a Bookshelf full of Magazines, photo-albums and bills for some reason. I remember trying to calculate how long i stayed there so it would be suspicious and i would get caught, and i made mental notes so i could Place everything i moved the same Place i found it. It felt like doing something illegal, but in a fun way. I had a blast going through the Magazines and especially browsing the photo-albums, making up intresting stories for the People in the sometimes absurd photos.



One day my little sister had been told to allert me about dinner-time, and caught me as i snuck out of the other house. For her silence i agreed to take her With me after dinner. She loved the idea of having a Secret With me so that wasnt a problem. But of course due to her Young age she obviously didnt have any intrest in the photos or the Magazines, to her it was most about doing something With me. I dont know why, but for some reason we started playing poker and a card-game called "idiot" when we snuck in there after that day. She usually braught her favorite stuffed animal and we took turns playing for it for fun. So far nothing out of the ordinary, and we did fill most days With traveling and sight-seeing and stuff With my parents, we just snuck in there every so often from time to time to play Cards and have fun With Our little Secret. 



On one of the last days however, i had promised to take my sister to the Beach after breakfast because my mother was having some stomach issue or something and my dad didnt want to i Guess.. Or maybe he had a reason, i dont remember, but for some reason i couldnt find my sister anywhere.. At first i figured she was playing With her toys or taking a nap or anything really, but as i walked around and checked room after room, and Place after Place i got more and more worried, but i didnt want to worry my parrents so i just kept searching driving myself crazy..It never occured to me that she was in the other house. first off all i had the key, and secondly i doubted she was tough enough to do it by herself due to her age and nature. 



Soon i started looking outside, and the second i got outside i got this weird feeling in my stomach, as if the other part of the house was telling me NOT to go there.. I started getting a really bad feeling that the other part of the house was warning me..I realized that despite it, i had to check it out..I remember thinking as i ran to find the keys and Lock myself in that maybe something had happened to her, maybe she had looked for me and gotten herself hurt or something, i was driving myself crazy..As i found the keys and started unlocking the door, i saw through the window not only my sister, safe and sound, sitting on the floor laughing NeXT to her stuffed animal, but it looked like she was interacting With someone, i got a very weird feeling i had never felt before as i stepped forward and leaned so i could see more of an angle..And sitting across from her was.. Me.. It was actually me? i saw myself playing Cards With my sister, making her laugh..it was me, but at the same time not me of course, as i was standing outside.. I was equally terrified and scared and confused, and for some reason my first reaction was to save my sister.. I started unlocking the door, for some reason whether it was my stress, or the Lock i dont know, but it was really stubborn, i freaked out and panicked as i tried to get the door open, at last i managed and pushed open the door and ran into the Space and kneeled in front of my sister as i in panick said 



-"Kristin, are you alright? Are you okay?? " 



She looked at me With a very confused look on her face as she asked me if i wasnt just on the toilet? I turned around and saw that "I" wasnt sitting infront of her anymore, the Version of me that was playing With my little sister.. I was terrified but i ran towards the bathroom, as i sprinted i figured id just Lock "myself" in the bathroom and Block the door and then come clean to my parents. As i entered the bathroom i didnt see myself, i even looked into the showers there, which didnt even look fully installed. As i turned around though i saw the back of my own head as i looked into the Mirror, not myself, but as if i looked at myself from behind, i was confused and scared and just stood there starring at myself, at some point i think i mentioned my sister, and at that point i saw myself give myself a backwards "thumbs up" before "i" dissapeared. It was as if i blinked and then "i" was gone. 



Freaked out i went back to my sister to rush us out of there, but she acted mostly confused and scared about my behavior then what had just happened. I calmed myself Down after she assured me that "of course" she was fine, and we went to the Beach as planned, we had fun, but i had a pit in my stomach that entire day. Not helped by the fact that my sister seeing two of me was appearently fine. I tried to talk to her about it on the final day before we left when she asked if i wanted to go into the house and play "idiot", but she acted as if she didnt even rememeber it, and as much as that did something to me, a part of me was glad.
