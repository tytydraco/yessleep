It was all my fault, and it almost cost Felicia and I our lives.

Our friend Sandy was having a house party, and we both wanted to go. Sandy threw the best parties, and they usually got pretty wild. The last one had been a real blow out, and we both had little more than foggy memories from it. Sandy was celebrating her graduation from Nursing school, so we all knew that this one was going to be a serious rager before she had to settle in to pay student loans.

Before we went, Felicia and I had agreed that one of us needed to stay sober so we could get home safely.

“We don't want a repeat of last time,” Felicia reminded me, and I nodded as I remembered how the Uber driver had tried to hold us captive until we agreed to invite him in.

Running in heels is never fun, but we had managed it that night, and beat him to the door of our apartment.

So we did rock paper scissors for it, went ten out of ten, and I ended up with the loss. I wasn't happy about it, but I decided that I would do my best to stay sober so we could get home without having to A. Get rides with creepy, handsy guys, B. Get murdered by a stranger, or C. Having to take a cab that neither of us could afford. We pulled up to the house, the party already in full swing, and I took a deep breath as I prepared to say no to temptation and be the best sober friend I could be.

I lasted all of an hour at the party before I just couldn't hold out anymore. Someone handed me a drink, didn't even ask, and I drank it before I could think better of it. It was one of the very tasty screwdrivers I had seen going around, and I decided then and there that this would be the only one. I could still hold out, one drink wasn't going to get me.

An hour after that, I was completely plastered, and Felicia was not pleased. She had decided to go all in, so now both of us were drunk and had no clue how we were going to get home. We took one look at each other, laughed, and said screw it. We drank way more than we should have that night and had a blast. We danced and drank and mingled our way through the party, and when Sandy waved us out around two am, we were basically holding each other up.

I staggered to the car, but I couldn't even get the key in the door to unlock it, let alone drive. Felicia and I decided we would just walk home. It was seven blocks from Sandy's house, but we had no chance of getting a cab this late and the Ubers would all be weirdos at this point. Felicia agreed, but was basically dead weight three steps later. She was ready to sleep and certainly wasn't interested in walking seven blocks. I was holding her up, looking for options as my own buzz wavered, when I saw a yellow cab parked at the corner. I got excited. It was a little late for cabs, but I wasn't about to question providence. The light was still on, the guy in the front looking pretty awake, and I thought our luck might be turning around as we staggered toward it.

I knocked on the window and a guy with red hair snugged under a driving cap jumped as he turned to look at us. He was a big guy, big with fat instead of muscle, and he looked surprised but also delighted as he rolled the window down. He asked how he could help us, and I told him we needed a lift. He asked where we were going, and after telling him the address I offered to give him a nice tip if he got us there safely with no weirdness.

“Yes, ma'am. I believe I can manage that,” he said with a big smile, “Hop in.”

So we piled in the back, he turned off his light, and off we went.

Felicia was asleep about the time we made the first turn, but I tried to stay awake to make sure the driver didn't try any funny business. We were from a pretty big city, and girls had been going missing pretty regularly lately. You read about it on Facebook all the time, they'd go out, get a little drunk, and then they'd never see them again. No one really knew what it was, but a lot of people thought it was a murderer. It was scary to think about, but I felt a little safer being in a real cab rather than an Uber or some random guy. You never quite knew what the vetting process on Uber was, but I knew that cab companies had to do background checks on their drivers, so at least this fella was on the up and up.

“You ladies coming from a club?” he asked, making small talk as he took his first left.

“House party,” I said, trying to be polite, “Our friend was throwing a real heck of a get together and we partied a little too hard, I think.”

“Sounds like fun.” he said with a laugh, “Looks like your friend had a little too much though.”

I laughed, “Ya, she does that sometimes. I was supposed to stay sober so I could drive us home, but I'm not very good at it.”

He laughed, “Well, I guess it's a good thing for me.”

I made a noncommittal noise, and settled back. There was a little holder on the patrician with waters in it, and when I reached for one, I saw the cabby turn to track my movement. He seemed interested in what I was doing, and I held up one of the waters and said that one of his fairs must have left it behind . It was a shame, because my stomach was a little too full of alcohol and some water would have been nice.

“Oh, those are for fairs. I have a bunch in a cooler up here and I replace them as needed. Help yourself.”

I thanked him, testing the seal to make sure it was sealed. It seemed to be, but I never got it open. The feel of the wheels beneath me was lulling me to sleep, and I was losing the fight. I tried to stay awake, but I was just too drunk. My eyes kept slipping shut and opening, slipping shut and opening, and as I threatened to go under for good, I heard his phone ring. He picked it up, talking to someone on the other end, and it was like his whole personality changed. He spoke in a much different voice than he'd used with us, and gone was a jovial guy who had picked us up. Now he was gruff and kind of short with whoever he was talking to, and it seemed like a complete flip in personality.

“Ya, I gottum. We'll be there soon.”

I started to ask what he meant by that, but before I could question the statement, I was unconscious.

I don't know how long we were out, but I woke up suddenly and was unsure of where we were.

I looked around, groggy and disoriented. Felicia was still sleeping beside me, dead to the world and not showing any signs of coming back, and the cabby was still behind the wheel and driving us home. At least, I thought he was. I glanced out the window, no longer seeing tall buildings and concrete, and thought he must have taken a wrong turn. We were in the country, the buildings traded for rural pavement and shadowy houses. Everything was dark outside, no street lights this far out in the country, and I just watched it wizz by for a moment as I tried to make sense of it. I was confused, unsure how we had gotten so lost, and then I remembered the conversation before I passed out.

“Ya, I gottum. We'll see you soon.”

Even in my drink-addled brain, I remembered those words.

I glanced at the numbers on the dashboard clock and was surprised to see that we had been in the cab for over an hour. It shouldn't have taken that long to get home. Seven blocks would have been an easy drive this late at night, and as I tried to sit up I felt something press against my wrist. The unopened water was a cool presence against my arm. I didn't remember opening it, and realized I must have fallen asleep before I could drink it. My vision swam as I tried to come upright, and I blinked quickly to clear it.

“Where,” I tried, but my throat was dry, “Where are we?”

The Cabby jumped a little, probably figuring I had passed out like my friend, and when he looked over his shoulder I heard, again, the voice of that happy cabby who had picked us up came out again.

“We're driving to your home.”

I tried to make his words make sense, but it was like wading through mush.

“This isn't right,” I mumbled, “I live in the city.”

“You told me 175 Worth Street.” he said, tapping his phone in the holder on the dash.

“No,” I slurred, trying to make my head stop spinning, “It was 751 Worthy Street. We were,” I put a hand to my mouth as the hot vomit threatened to come coursing up it, “We were only seven blocks from our house.”

He put a theatrical hand to his brow, “Oh my gosh, I guess I put the address in wrong. Let me just find a place to turn around and we'll get you back on track.”

He started tapping at the phone, but I could see he wasn't hitting anything. I was suddenly wary, some of my intoxication ebbing as he put on a show of trying to get the address in right. I remembered those stories about girls going missing, and wondered if our names and faces would be on the news tomorrow. Would they think we just wandered off after drinking too much? Would they even look for us?

He turned down a side road, saying he was going to turn around, but instead of turning around he kept driving. I banged feebly at the glass that separated us, telling him he was going the wrong way, but I was so weak. I felt very dehydrated, my mouth dry and my head spinning. I reached for the water, but I thought better of it. I didn't want anything he might give me, and as the top came off, I squeezed it against the little holes that allowed us to hear him. He jumped and cursed, turning around to glower at me as the voice from the phone came back again.

“You stupid bitch! I hope you keep that energy when they get you. They'll teach some manners.”

My blood ran cold at that, and I let the empty water bottle fall as I looked for other options. I tried the doors, but the child locks were on and I couldn't get it open. I started to panic. I kicked at the door, at the glass, but each kick was more feeble than the last. I was starting to feel like I might pass out again. The Cabby laughed, telling me about all the terrible things the people he was taing me to would do, and my vision was swimming with tears. I bent over and puked in the floorboard, some of my vision clearing up as I purged the liquor, but it also left me feeling weak and unsteady. I banged my head against the glass as we finally came to a halt, and I went shakily to the window to see where we were. We were not, miraculously, in front of my apartment, the whole thing a dream or a hallucination, but in a vacant lot down some country back road.

At the end of the vacant lot, perched like a gargoyle, was a white van waiting for us to arrive. As we sat idling, the doors came open and shadowy men started getting out. I felt my blood run cold as they walked toward us, stopping halfway between as if waiting for the Cabby. I thought again about my car sitting in front of Sandy's house, about how I could have just driven us home if I had stayed sober.

“Looks like we've reached your destination,” said the Cabby, turning around to flash me a big creepy grin as he slid his seat belt off, “Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back,” and he hopped out to go talk to them.

I shook Felicia, trying to wake her up, but she was little more than dead weight. They would get her, and they would get me in my current weakened condition. I couldn't fight them off, I could barely keep my head up, and I cried bitter tears in the back of that cab. If I was lucky, maybe they'd just kill us, but I doubted it. We were both likely to end up in some overseas brothel or on the streets of South America, and either prospect sounded grim.

The Cabby shook hands with one of the shadow people, pointing back to the cab and likely telling them he had a couple of half drunk girls ready for transport. We were in the middle of nowhere. There was no chance anyone was coming to help us. We'd be heading wherever in no time, gone and forgotten, never to be seen again, and there was nothing to be done about it.

It appeared, however, that someone had other ideas.

They had started walking toward the cab when lights suddenly lit up the back glass. Cars suddenly began pulling up, vans and undercover cars, and the people came out of them with guns drawn. The men in the headlights of the cab put their hands up and as they surrounded them they had them cuffed and collared pretty quickly. They took the men away and that was when they seemed to realize that they had people in the back of the cab. They helped us get somewhere safe so they could get us checked out and I'm pretty sure Felicia never woke up through the whole thing. They kept assuring us that we were okay, that we were safe, but all I could do was cry. I felt like I had been plucked from the brink at the last minute and I thanked them with every breath I had.

That was how I was almost trafficked by some gang or organization or another. The cops told us the less we know the better, and I agreed. I haven't drank since then, and now I'm the permanent designated driver for our group. I take friends of friends home too, sometimes intoxicated women we've met that night, just to make sure no one has to go through what I went through.
