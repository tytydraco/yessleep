I was hanging from the balcony as it was trying to get me
Luckily after not being able to reach me
she turned around and started running towards
Nemanja
I climbed halfway up and started yelling at it to come back but it was too late

As it ran towards him,he had no choice but to jump over and two stores down or face the thing

As the thing was gaining on him,he jumped from the second story stairs and crash landed on the floor
I heard a sickening crunch and he stopped moving
In the meantime I was able to climb back onto the balcony and sneak by it and down the stairs to check on Nemanja
his spine and legs were broken.he was paralyzed but alive
Knowing i was short on time as it was following me down the stairs
i grabbed Nemanja's knife and started running towards her knowing i had no chance of escaping with Nemanja
she grabbed me by the neck and started to choke me in midair

but i was ready

With the knife in my shaky hand i stabbed her in the neck.

To my surprise her red eyes started turning white as her form reached its peak Although it was short-lived as the clock struck 3 am and I was thrown to the wall with tremendous force and fainted...


when i woke up i was in bed covered in sweat and my alarm was beeping...
When i realized what had happened i was cursing at myself.
"Fuck!,i was so close,if i only i wasn't stupid to think her attention would be on me,Nemanja would have been fine and we would've succeed in killing that god damned thing".

As i tried to get out of the bed a sharp pain went thru my body,and a headpearcing headache
I was too weak to get up.
"i was too careless.
i almost got Nemanja killed with my stupid idea.
If i cant get up he is probably in unbearable pain,
All because of me.
He's suffering again because of me.
I am an idiot...


I took the painkillers i left on the desk and rushed to the pharmacy to buy some for Nemanja.
After that i ran to his house and got in thru the window into his room...

He was playing CS:GO completely fine,he didn't even notice me because of his headphones.
I was tapping him on the shoulder but for some reason he did not notice my aggressive tapping
so i smacked him on the back of his head, knocking the headphones off of his head.
He looked at me with surprise in his eyes.


"When did you get in" he said

"Bruh i was tapping you on the shoulder for like two minutes and you didn't notice me".

"Well * **** ***** **** ******** **** * **** **" he said

"WHAT!?"

"What do you mean what,you were there"he said

"We have to get you to a doctor or something"

"There is no need,it could prove to be useful in the long run"he said

"There will be no long run!
How are you feeling,can you even use your body properly?"

"Yes i am just fine,who knows why this is good"he said

"let's just hope that its not permanent"
 



"Enough about that, let's talk about what we're gonna do next,and what happened after i fell".He said

"Well i grabbed the knife,charged at Her,got my dignity crushed,stabbed Her,got my ass thrown to the wall,3 am comes and I woke up".


"And for what we should do.
I think we should run because she started evolving before i was out.

thus we don't have a lot of options
we can run
we can fight
or
maybe just stay there"

"We can't stay
The place is trashed.he said"


"Yeah you are right.we would be too vulnerable"

"So we run?"he asked

"Yeah,we run to the store to get supplies and take shelter in there for a while"

"until something comes again"Nemanja says with a tired look on his face

"Don't worry, we'll be ready this time around"

"Alright"Nemanja says with a sigh and a slight smile on his face



I stayed at his place for a few hours playing games with him,trying to ease my anxiety for tonight.
We said our goodbyes and i went home exhausted,and nervous about falling asleep.but i did...

And there it was again,the falling sensation,the headache.Then i woke up in the house where we left of.stuck here without a shadow once again.
