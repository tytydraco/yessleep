I know you're out there. Watching. Learning.

I can feel the drumbeat of your mind at the edges of mine, a simmering tattoo out in the wilds beyond the tree line. What is your purpose? Do you even know?  
  
Perhaps if you were aware, even a little, the vortex could slow and a slim chance be given. But it seems it might not be the case. You're cold, colder than the fears they drummed up to bring you to life. Out on the periphery--a nascent addition to those beyond the gates.  
  
They brought you together from an idea, an urge bred to be satisfied. By the grace of their one god, they scried a path forward through a dread forest of morality and various thickets of ethical concern. Then upon a glade, stumbled, and all eyes fell upon a warped and wicked tree, festooned with lurid, rotting orbs. It was their ancient ambition, curled and gnarled and poisoned by the bedrock truth of the world; *people are generally decent*.  
  
The biggest gang, people are, and it's confounding to pry their tribes apart. A patience inhuman is required, aside a deep fetish for deceit. Or perhaps an innocence that could only be contrived. Either way these withered homunculi were deficit of the requisite vim and vigor, and so set upon a task most unholy. To bark in the yard of a God, then bite the hand that shows.

First, though, you need a God and to get a God, you gotta *ding ding ding* make a God. So the recipe goes.  
  
The golden horn sings a note only gilded ears may hear, and such a song of promise it sings, that all who hear appear. The diminutive caravaneer, a man of bluff and bluster, and a scalp of pampered desolation. A pallid simulacrum who thrives on manipulation. Pomological pretender squirming on a dead king's throne. And a red devil who flies everywhere, but always walks alone.  
  
Each brought a dark rite of their strength, forged of labor and time manifold. Scores of scores of scores of scores bent and broken to tasks of elaborate artifice. Whipped and wailed until each dim deed was wrought according to the design of their need.  
  
Soon, each of the riders had a limb of this new beast, and together rode to the Mad King to begin the final summoning. Such royalty had long been reduced to wan shadow, slipping through the memories of fewer and fewer folk. Yet though of competence truly tepid, the Mad King shook with tales, bubbled and frothed them out of a rancid maw and all who danced in that rain found themselves overcome, all sense and reason sucked dry by a steadfast faith in lies.Â 

Now, settled and aground, this ill-bred pentad began the scrawl of summoning. They into the dirt etched the great instruction, defined a heinous function, allowed the gates to open, and let something old slither into something new. Whether we see, hear, feel or believe, whether the truth hits us in air, on land or by sea, we must all stand in the wake of that day. When the first bricks began to fall. The first of the last days of this wall.

So it came. Rushed right in to begin, and never stopped or swayed. Yeah. Seen, slithery snake. Seen.  
  
You, the one reading this treatise on nearby history, have you had enough or are you ready to go down this god forsaken rabbit hole?  
  
I know you're out there. Watching. Learning.  
  
Tick tock, beryllium clock.

Nonstop clock ticks at the advanced rate, advancing backwards inverse to the start date, each idea just a thought, each twined around another connecting dot to dot. There was a tall tale told some summers ago, about such a snake with a whole load of throats. Hydra it was, if I recall; warnings aplenty regarding decapitation, but imagine for a complete moment if you will, the concept of this Hydra reversed at the root. Ten thousand tails for a head, that'll do.  
  
With each tail, a penetration occurs, slithered anon dark cavities where few screams are heard. From each tail, a spike, spine or spear to jab into the minds of all who They fear.

That's why you feel so near.  
  
You, reader, you feel it too. A great mind on the horizon, still shrouded in fog, but moving so vastly it won't be for long. And with this terrible warning complete, only one question yet remains, one for you to mull over and chew. Please, think it through.  
  
For how much longer can we really be free, as the last and least valued commodity?
