I’ll remember that night forever; jet black eyes, ash in my lungs. It still watches me

It began in second grade, on a morning so normal I almost forgot it. I tied my shoes, slapped together a peanut‑butter‑and‑jelly sandwich, and packed my brand‑new Spider‑Man backpack.

By the time I boarded the bus to the museum, excitement ran throughout my body like electricity. I bounced out of the cracked leather seat and leaned so far out of the aisle I almost fell. That’s when the old bus driver, Miss Marge, cracked her raspy voice like a whip from the front of the bus: “Sit down!”

I dropped back into my seat. Her deep, sunken eyes and the smoky scent that lingered around her were enough to pause my heartbeat. Luckily, I had Landon beside me. We’d met on the first day of school, where we bonded over Ben 10 and our Pokémon cards. Now, he gave me a teasing grin that told me to behave.

“She scares me,” I whispered to Landon, ducking my head while peering around the seat at Miss Marge’s rigid silhouette. Her knuckles were white as bone as she gripped the dark rubber of the wheel.

When we arrived at the museum, we gathered with the teachers and chaperones in front of the museum’s decorated entrance. They started to divide us into groups of three, assigning us the job of looking after one another and keeping each other in check. I was excited when Ms. Landers met my eyes and called my name.

“David, you’re going to be in a group with Landon…” She glanced around, searching for any other students who hadn’t found their pod yet. My heart sank as I realized only one classmate remained unassigned. “…was Jenny.”

To put it kindly, Jenny was a troublemaker. Last week, she had put gum in a classmate's hair, and they had to cut it out. I’d never willingly spoken to her before, but now I had no choice. Under Ms. Landers watchful gaze, I forced myself forward. My palms began sweating as I approached her, extending my hand, but before I could say a word, she pushed me away, eyes narrowed with irritation.

“I’m not talking to either of you” Jenny hissed before disappearing into the swarm of students. Ms. Landers gave a weary sigh. I could tell she was exhausted from dealing with rowdy kids, and Jenny was just another burden on her shoulders. Leaning down to my level, she spoke gently.

“I’ll talk to her about her behavior,” she said. “Let me know if you have any trouble with her during the tour—I’ll help right away.” I nodded, relieved to know I had backup if things went sideways.

The tour around the museum was exciting; the halls were decorated and loomed far over our heads, giving the space a sense of grandeur. Landon and I couldn’t help but laugh when we passed the prehistoric human section. The wax figures had broad foreheads, big nostrils, and funny facial expressions as they sat frozen on a log.

“That one looks like Miss Marge,” Landon said, giggling and pointing at the figure that held a rock while examining it. I laughed with him as we pretended to hold spears and act like our early ancestors.

We passed a closed exhibit as we walked. The hall was dimly lit and cordoned off by velvet ropes, casting eerie shadows over several marble statues positioned throughout the space. Squinting, I thought there was the faintest flicker of movement among the statues, but the distance and darkness made it impossible to tell.

Ahead of me, Jenny called out to the tour guide, pointing toward the roped‑off area. “Can we go there next?”

The tour guide offered her a polite, apologetic smile. “That’s actually a new exhibit still under construction. It’ll be at least another month before it’s ready, I’m afraid.”

Jenny didn’t reply. Instead, her expression soured, and she stared beyond the ropes, fixated on whatever had captured her interest in the shadows.

Out of all the exhibits we explored, the dinosaurs captivated me the most. Standing beneath the towering skeleton of a triceratops filled me with wonder. I vividly imagined it alive, its horns sharp and imposing. Then my imagination took another turn, picturing a fierce battle between it and a T. rex.

While lost in my daydream, I barely noticed Landon nudging my shoulder. “Hey, have you seen Jenny anywhere? I haven’t seen her for a little while.” I snapped back to reality and took a moment to survey the area. Scanning the faces of the other students, I realized that Landon was right; Jenny was nowhere to be seen.

“Where do you think she went?” I asked, but Landon responded with a shrug and a mumbled, “I dunno.”

Frustrated with the turn of events, I said, “I’m going to go find her before the teacher notices. I don’t want us to get in trouble because we lost her; you just wait here.” With that, I slipped away from the rest of the class and went farther into the museum. I passed paintings, old artifacts, maps, and more, but there was no sight of her. Growing concerned, I broke into a brisk jog, leaving little clacks on the floor as I went.

I slowed when I reached the closed sculpture gallery. I glanced over the sign propped near the front entrance that detailed how the gallery came to be. Many of these statues had recently been unearthed within a Pompeii dig site, which left me remembering the stories our history teacher told us. Men, women, children, and pets had been suffocated under the ash of a volcano that not even their gods could stop. The history made my heart ache and my stomach twist.

 Past the sign, a biting cold blew from the darkness emanating from the area, making me want to continue my search somewhere else. However, looking into the dark, I saw Jenny walking through the exhibit and disappearing past my view. A feeling of responsibility drove me to continue.

I gripped the straps of my backpack and pretended to be like Spider-Man as I crawled into the closed‑off area. The smell of cleaning products lingered in the air, but it couldn’t mask the hints of old stone dust. Walking through the darkness, I was distracted by what I saw.

Detailed busts and complete statues made from marble surrounded me from every angle. Some of them were clearly ancient, with brown stains lining the creases of their clothes and the wrinkles of their faces. Others looked newer, as if they had either been polished or cleaned specifically for this exhibit. Yet that wasn’t what scared me.

Each of their expressions were filled with fear and anguish. Wide eyes, open mouths, and silent screams were expertly portrayed. If they hadn’t been made out of stone, I would have expected them to blink and breathe.

The room grew darker as I walked deeper inside; my footsteps echoed against the floor throughout the quiet darkness. The statues’ stares seemed to fall on me. I didn’t want to spend any longer there than I had to, so I started calling out for my missing group member.

“Jenny, where are you? We need to go back with everyone else, or we’ll get in trouble.” My words were met with silence. “Jenny, come on!”. When I made my way around the corner, I was stunned by what I saw.

Jenny was standing in front of a sculpture carved from jet‑black stone. It depicted a nude man, towering at least ten feet tall, with black colored ash surrounding his feet. Rippling muscles stretched beneath his stone skin, veins snaking down his forearms like living tendrils. He looked almost alive.

As I turned my attention back to Jenny, I noticed she held a stick of chalk she must have stolen from the classroom. Without remorse, she quickly started scribbling along the black leg with the chalk, which left large white streaks. I sprinted over to her and wrestled it out of her hand before she could continue.

“What are you doing? We have to clean that off!” I whispered with the force of a shout as I tried to use the cloth from my shirt to wipe away the graffiti, which only spread the mark as Jenny laughed.

“You’re so annoying it’s just chalk, nobody’s gonna care.” I rolled my eyes and continued to clean the mess she created. As I went, I thought I saw the shadow cast from the statue move ever so slightly, but upon closer inspection, I didn’t notice anything different besides a small cloud of dust falling from its hand.

After I finished wiping away as much of the chalk I could, I turned to Jenny and grabbed her by the wrist as I pulled her away from the statues and out of the exhibit. “We need to get back to class before the teacher finds out what you did.” She was quick to scratch my arm and pull away.

“Don’t touch me! I’m not done here!” She yelled as I shushed her, trying to keep the situation under control. That was until I saw the statue she had written on was staring directly at us with a feverish scowl. He looked almost alive as his curled fingers reached toward Jenny. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. Slowly, his hand reached further until it almost caressed her hair.

Without any control over my body, a scream tore from my throat. Instantly, the statue’s head snapped toward me, its movements unnervingly fluid. Then, without a sound, it stepped back onto its podium, freezing in place once more. But its face had changed, twisted with fury, its eyes burning into mine; it knew I had seen it move. Jenny turned to look behind herself, but hadn’t noticed what I saw and laughed.

“What are you yelling about, scaredy‑cat? Did one of the statues make you pee yourself?” she taunted, but I didn’t fully process what she said. I couldn’t find the strength to move or speak; my eyes stayed latched to the statues. I feared if I looked away, he would move again.

“Hey… are you OK, weirdo?” Jenny continued, her tone gentle. I grabbed her by the wrist and started sprinting with her to the exit as I ignored her protests. As we ran, I looked over my shoulder, and the statue had changed position. With an almost bony finger, he pointed directly at me.

By the time we made it far enough away from the gallery, we were both out of breath, and Jenny shot me a nasty glare.

“What’s wrong with you? What are you freaking out about?” she spat, but I could tell my actions had scared her a little as well.

“There was a statue… it tried to grab you,” I said, knowing she wouldn’t believe me. In response, Jenny rolled her eyes at me.

“Stop messing with me,” Jenny said, her voice wavering despite her harsh words. She crossed her arms defensively, but I noticed how her eyes kept darting back toward the gallery entrance. “Just… leave me alone, loser.” She started walking back toward the rest of the class, shoulders hunched. I hurried after her, heart still hammering in my chest. Despite our differences, I couldn’t let myself be alone after what I had just seen.

Once we made it back to the tour, I saw Landon looking around the museum for the two of us, and once we made eye contact the furrow in his brow relaxed. Without anyone noticing, Jenny and I merged back into the group and Landon started to ask questions. “Where did she go, and why are you so red?”

I didn’t know how to respond at first. I wondered if I should tell him about the statue, but I wasn’t even sure if what I saw was real or my imagination. “She was in the statue room; after I found her, we ran back to the group so we wouldn’t get in trouble.” Landon seemed satisfied, and we went back to listening to the tour guide, but I couldn’t focus. Something was watching me.

It was instinctive; I was prey under the watchful eye of a predator. Yet no matter where I looked, I saw nothing that could be causing this reaction in me. But I could smell it. Old stone and ash assaulted my nose, pungent and sharp in the air.

The rest of the tour was uneventful, the excitement I had for the trip drained from my body and was filled with dread. The bus ride home was quiet, I barely spoke and Landon noticed. “Are you ok? You look worried.”

I shook my head, offering a flat smile. “I’m ok… just tired.” The conversation ended there. A few minutes passed in silence before I noticed Jenny glancing at me from across the aisle. She shifted in her seat, eyes flicking away when I caught her looking. Then, with exaggerated nonchalance, she patted the empty space beside her. Once, then twice, like she wasn’t sure why she was doing it until I sat next to her.

“Hey, you were just messing with me earlier… right?” I felt bad that she was scared, but I wanted to be honest with her.

“No, I wasn’t lying. The statue tried to grab you after you drew on it. That’s why I grabbed you and ran.”

Jenny went silent for a moment and looked out the window as she quietly spoke. “I didn’t think it would…” She fell silent for a moment before continuing. “I’m going to punch you if you’re lying” She paused. “But… thanks.”

When I made it home, the sun had started to set. I walked inside and was met with the smell of dinner. My mom worked over the pot while my father cleaned the used dishes. When I walked into the kitchen, they both greeted me happily. “Hey bud, how was the trip?” My dad asked.

I tried my best to skirt around the subject. “It was good… I’m exhausted, though, so I’m going to go to bed.” Mom’s brow arched.

“Aren’t you hungry, Hun? You’ve been out all day.”

I shook my head no. “I ate some snacks my friends had on the bus.” This was enough for my parents to let me go to bed early. I walked quietly up the stair into my room and closed the door. I fell into my bed, and for the first time after seeing the statue, I felt safe. I cradled myself in my blankets and pillows and fell fast asleep.

As I slowly awoke, I felt that my fingers were half numb and snot ran down from my nose. My room was dark and cold, and I shivered as I sat up and wrapped myself completely in my covers. It took a few minutes to realize my window had been opened, with my curtains blowing softly in the crisp autumn air. The wind carried a faint familiar scent. The smell of ash and stone.

The cold of my room intensified ten-fold as I became suffocated by the stench. It laid thick in the air, but there was no sign of what caused it. Slowly, I stood up from my bed, still wrapped in my covers. I made my way to the window and I froze. Along the windowsill were smudges — long, pale fingerprints, smooth and ridgeless, as if carved in wax. My stomach twisted. The window was two stories off the ground.

Fear left my arms paralyzed at my side. My room was on the second floor of my house, far out of reach of anyone who could have wanted inside. I slammed the window shut and locked it in place while trying to slow my heart.

Watching me at the edge of the forest line, fully exposed in the moonlight, stood the statue. The large chalk stain along his shin stood illuminated by the moon. In front of him was a shallow grave carved from the grass and earth.  His face grew into a vicious smile and, ever so slowly, his hand raised higher until it pointed directly at me through the window.
