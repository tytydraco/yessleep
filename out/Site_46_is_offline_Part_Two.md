The others attempted to rush him but I had sprinted toward him quicker than they could and tackled him through the doorway into the bunker. ["Get the door!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nc12i/site_46_is_offline_part_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I shouted just after landing. Sure enough, too, they managed to get the door shut and locked just before one of them could barge in. Daniel and I were on the ground for a solid two minutes, rigid, stiff, unable to move, before finally realizing it was safe to relax. "What.. the fuck... was that?" Daniel asked, panting.

"I... I don't know... I think that was one of the Hazmat crew."

"The Hazmat crew?" one of the others asked. I shook my head, looking at Daniel.

"You saw it, too, right?"

"Yeah..." he replied, shuddering. "Yeah, I saw that."

"But what happened to him, and who are those others?"

"I don't know, Craig and I found him stumbling into the hallway before he turned into..." I pointed to the door, "*that*."

"Where're the others?" Daniel asked.

"That was them, man. The thing got to 'em, did something to them, and now they're just like him." His and everyone else's eyes doubled in size when I said this.

"What is it?" someone asked.

"I just told you I don't know!" I shouted back.

"You said it was one of the Hazmat crew?" Daniel asked again. I shook my head. The two of us picked ourselves off the ground and dusted ourselves off, caught our breaths, and Daniel asked me to start from the beginning. I told him, as best I could -- most of it at the time was kind of a blur to me so it took me a second -- everything that happened.

"I don't know what the hell any of that was, other than something obviously's gone wrong topside and now..." I finished by gesturing to the door again.

"Well now what do we do?" someone cried from my right.

Someone else cried, "We're screwed now. There's no one to come for us!"

"Alright, alright, calm down, people." Daniel said. They all looked at him. "Look, panicking ain't gonna do us no--"

"Oh, can it." someone from the crowd shouted.

Another person shouted, "Yeah, look what's happening now, man. How the hell are we *not* supposed to panic?" The room was in utter pandemonium again. Everyone, everywhere, at the same time was shouting all different variants of either "We're fucked" or "We're all gonna die" and shit like that. I watched Daniel try pitifully to calm the room down. His usually dominant voice, one that would've made a drill Seargent jealous, was now little more than a pathetic coo of a child in the midst of a sea of cacophony.

Just like earlier, I can't say I actually blamed them for wanting to panic. That being said, it wasn't calming my own nerves either, so I took matters into my own hands to get everyone's attention by grabbing the nearest jar that contained the medical supplies and smashed it on the ground. Almost immediately, the room went dead silent.

"Alright, listen, I can't take any more craziness right now, okay?"

Some smartass from the back piped up saying, "This coming from the dumbass that started this shit in the first place." I looked in the direction the voice came from. I couldn't see him but it didn't matter, I could see they were all in agreement from the look they were all collectively giving me.

"You know what, you're right. It was my fault. It was my fault this thing, whatever the unholy hell it is, is spreading and it's my fault the others are fucked now. There, that what you wanted to hear? Yes, it. Was. My. Fault. But damn it, sitting here, panicking, isn't gonna do us a damn bit of good, now will it?"

They all continued looking at me while my attention turned to Daniel. "Now, what do you think we should do?" He chuckled, sort of condescendingly, but in his case, it was warranted this time around.

"Well, I'd say the best bet would be to try and reach someone off the site."

"How?" I asked. He pulled out his phone and began dialing.

"That won't work, will it?" someone from the back of the crowd asked. "The signal's restricted, ain't it?"

"It is," I said, "but there's a system for emergency calls, ain't there? Sort of like a failsafe line; the "Lockdown line", right, that brings the emergency teams?"

"Uh huh." he said, putting the phone to his ear. "And if you paid attention to at least *one* of the million training videos they forced us to watch, you'd remember the safeword to initiate said line, like I--" He stopped dead, his eyes going wide.

"What?" I asked. My heart was instantly thrown into high gear again. "Spit it out, what is it?" He turned around and looked at me, face white as a damn piece of paper and said the words that've haunted every second of my sleep ever since then for a year; "Site 46 is offline..."

"Wait what?" someone asked. "What does that mean?"

Not taking my eyes away from Daniel, I said in a shuddering breath, "It means we're cut off completely."

"So wait, that means we can't call for help? At all?" they cried.

"That's right."

"So what the fuck are we gonna do?" I didn't reply -- I really couldn't. I was out of ideas, having already realized my ideas were bad anyway, and Daniel was in perpetual shock, not even having brought the phone down from his ear.

"Won't someone from the head levels notice something's up when they see the power's out and the signal's gone?" I heard another ask.

"They might, but even if they have already noticed, which honestly isn't likely, It'd still be a good few days, maybe weeks, before they could get an emergency team out here that way. The Lockdown crew was meant for immediate emergencies like this, but without the signal--"

"Well is there a way to get the signal back online?" they interjected.

"The only way's through the main office." said Daniel, finally returning his phone to his pocket.

"You mean we'd have to go out *there?!*" someone else cried.

"We'll all die!" exclaimed another. "Those things'll get us and--"

"Settle down, damn it!" I shouted. "Just told you I can't take any more anxiety right now." I looked again at Daniel. "What's the quickest way to get there, do you know?" He looked down and shook his head.

"Only route I know of through the main corridors."

"Okay, well, obviously that's out. I mean, my little crew from earlier didn't even make it out of this hallway before getting fucked up."

"Well then we're stuck because there isn't any other way to the--"

"Not true, I think I may know of a way." piped someone from the very back. Daniel and I looked over to him. He was a round man with overalls and a hardhat with a toolbelt around his waist. Maintenance and engineering crew. Makes sense *he'd* be the one to say this. Daniel waved him to come forward and he did.

"You said you have another route to the main office?" Daniel asked.

"I think so, I mean, it's a bold maneuver; something I myself haven't used in ages now, and I don't know nothin' about where these things y'all are talkin' about are now, but--"

"Out with it." I said impatiently.

He cleared his throat and said, "Well, if I remember correctly, there should be a tunnel network us maintenance crew use to get around, you know?" Daniel and I both silently nodded. "It's supposed to have access to every part of the site and get you to any place here you wanted to go."

"And you could access this place from in here?" asked Daniel.

"Uh huh, in fact, it's right over there." He pointed to a spot in the far left corner. He walked over and and lifted up four of the tiles to reveal a drop into a small tunnel.

"That's been there the entire time?" someone asked.

"Yeah," the maintenance guy responded, "every room in every wing of Site 46 has one of these."

"How come you didn't say something about this before?" I asked.

"Well, like I said, I ain't used 'em in a while. Nobody I know has. Honestly, I'm a bit surprised it's still here."

"What do you mean?"

"Well see, like I told you, they were reserved for the maintenance workers to get around. Thing is, though, those tunnels ain't exactly roomy, if you take my meaning. They ain't that well lit, either, and unfortunately, the physicals and screenings they subjected us to for this job weren't thorough enough to catch the unfortunate bastards that had severe claustrophobia, so while we would be trying to get from point A to point B, you'd have Ol' Harry behind ya, wigging out, so they finally told us that we'd just remain topside and move around with the rest of youse."

Daniel and I looked down at the tunnel. The guy wasn't kidding about the tunnel looking cramped. It looked like it would just barely fit an average sized person, giving him *just enough* room to walk in one direction with none left to spare for him to turn his head. The two of us looked up at each other.

"So this's our play?" I asked.

"Unless you have a better suggestion." he replied, gesturing his eyes to the door, silently teasing me. I sighed and looked back down into the tunnel. *Great, instead of a dark ass hallway, it's a dark ass tunnel.*

"So exactly how're we gonna do this? You know we can't all fit in there at the same time." He sighed, looking back down himself.

"Yeah, that is the rub, ain't it?" He thought for a moment before asking me, "Say, "Iron Rod", you wanna try taking point again?" I looked up at him. He had his eyebrow raised in an eager manner, one that suggested he was planning something bold.

"Uh... Sure, I guess..."

"Well I was thinking, since you were the only one dumb enough to wanna go out there the first time, and the one that decided to drag the rest of us down with ya, why don't you *actually* be the hero this time around?" I frowned at him.

"What do you me--" Then it hit me like a moving train. "Oh, you motherfucker!" His snide little grin grew and he winked, pointing downward. I glanced back and forth between him and the tunnel. "What the hell, man? I can't go it alone, not down there."

"What, you afraid of tight spaces all of a sudden?"

"No, but... What if those things are in there?"

"Well, you managed to slip your little ass out of trouble before, you'll do it again."

"But I don't know how to even get to the main office from here, not through there." This legitimately seemed to stump him. He started looking around at the crowd then.

"Does anybody still have their walkies?" he asked. One guy stepped forward with his, which was then rudely thrust into my chest by Daniel before he then took out his own and started tuning it. "Okay, now I'm gonna walk you through how to get there." He looked over to the maintenance guy and asked, "Hey, you got any kind of map of these tunnels?"

He dug around in his pocket and replied, "As a matter of fact, I do." He pulled out a small folded up map and handed it to Daniel. Daniel then told him to give me his headlamp before telling me, making sure to add his signature shit-eating smirk -- complete with his TV spokesperson's wink and thumbs up -- to hurry and get my ass down the hatch into the tunnels.

"Good luck, *buddy!"* was the last thing he said to me before I reluctantly dropped into the tunnels. *"Buddy"... Yeah up yours, too...*

As soon as I dropped down, I struggled taking a step forward because of the way the walls were so tightly packed together. It felt like what you'd expect a piece of bread to feel while popped into a toaster; compacted on both sides of you with no way to turn or go to get out. It made sense, too, that I  was the one he sent down there, too. Next to, as he put it, "Being the only one bold enough to try something stupid like this the last time", I was also likely the only one that even had a chance of fitting down here and being able to maneuver as easily as I was. Everyone else, those that could've even fit that is, would've still had a far harder time than me trying to move.

As soon as I was out of sight range from the hatch, I heard the walkie going off. *"Breaker, breaker, this is Smoky here, I repeat, Smokey here, how ya doin' down there, Bandit? Over."* I couldn't help but scoff at this. He was *really* making jokes about this right now. *Yeah, laugh it up, asswipe.*

I clicked the button and replied, "It's about as cramped in here as your sister was last night, but overall, no trouble yet, I guess." I could imagine the entire room just busting their guts laughing at this. Yep, that was Steel Jockey humor for you; even when in the worst of situations, we downplay it like it's just another day on the site. Be it our first, or tragically the last, we're gonna make jokes about it. *"Alright, now you're gonna keep going straight till you find a two way crossroad. There, you're gonna want to take a right. Copy that, Bandit? Over."*

"I copy, Jackass. Over."

*"Uh, Uh, "Smokey's" the name, Bandit. Over."*

Putting on my best hillbilly accent, I clicked the button and replied, "Well now I hear ya, loud n' clear, Smokey ol' pal. I'll just mosey on down yonder to those there crossways you was yappin' about n' go my happy ass on down to the main office. On the way, might just bag me a coupla them ornery little critters that've been runnin' BUCK wild down here. Yee haw!"

*"Alright, alright, seriously though, where are ya now? Over."*

"I'm at the crossing now, actually. You said to take a right now, didn't you? Over."

*"That's right, Bandit, just take yourself a right, then you'll go till you hit another junction, then you'll take another right. Copy? Over."*

"Copy that, Smokey, Ol' buddy. Over." I rolled my eyes and took the right. Fortunately, the halls were actually a bit more spread apart from each other, allowing me at least enough room to actually turn and look over my shoulder. The only complaint I would have about this hall though was just how damn hot it was. I mean, I took five, maybe seven steps, and I was already out of breath and sweating. I couldn't keep it up much longer if this was going to be the conditions of the place. Fortunately, it wasn't long until I actually hit the next junction.

I took the right, where I was met with the surprise of the room now being ice cold. I clicked on the radio. "Alright, Smokey, I'm freezing my ass off in the next tunnel, where do I go from here? Over."

*"Alright, from that tunnel, you'll go till you're about three fourths of the way there, then you're gonna find a hatch that's gonna take you to another tunnel junction. Go through there and take the left, copy? Over."*

"Copy that, Over." *Okay, so just go THREE FOURTHS of the way there... No problem... Right?*

Well there was a problem. Now, I didn't have the map or blueprints in front of me like Daniel did, nor did I know the ins and outs of this area like the maintenance guy did, but if I was a betting man, I'd have gambled everything I had that the past two tunnels I'd gone through were somehow connected to the central A.C. units, which would explain why one was scorching hot while the next almost gives you frostbite the second your dumb ass walks in. Unlike the last tunnel, this one wasn't a short trek, either. (*Yeah, thank GOD it's only 3/4 of the way this time...)*

I pushed on as hard as I could, my hands and feet going completely numb after reaching what I figured was the quarter of the way into the tunnel. My breath was forming clouds in front of my face. *Jesus, yeah, I can imagine people losing their minds having to work in areas like this.* Part of me also wondered if maybe Daniel knew somehow that this little crusade would take me through a place like this and purposely sent me in without a jacket of something; you know, for laughs. *"Steel Jockey humor" for you...*

I got to the midway point before I stopped, hearing a clanking noise coming from all around me. It rang from all sides, above me as well as to my left and right. I looked, but couldn't see anything moving or any sort of indentations of the metal being pressed upon. I figured then that it was just the units trying to kick back in, sort of trying to fight to get recirculating through the building again, so I shook my head and continued shambling forward.

In two seconds, my guess was proven to be horrifically wrong when I watched the hatch in front of me get thrown open where a man fell out onto the frigid metal floor. I heard him groaning and I froze. I wasn't about to get any closer to him. I'd learned at least *that much* from last time.

The man struggled to pick himself up and he looked at me. He wore the uniform of one of the lab workers. It was a lab monkey, and he looked like he'd already got the worst of whatever he and his little band of geeks in the Chem labs conjured up. Ironic, ain't it?

His skin was albino, standing out from the darkness of the tunnel, and his eyes were sunken into their sockets and his jaw hung like it was barely being held to his head by a piece of string. He reached out to me and I took a step back with every step he took forward. He groaned again and this time, I faintly made out what I think were the words "Help me, please."

Whatever he said, it was immediately forgotten when he fell flat on his face and that all too hauntingly familiar *POP* echoed through the tunnel, which was my cue to gun it the hell out of there. I didn't wait around for the creature to get itself up and moving. No, I was gone; back out of the freezing tunnel, through the scorching one, and from there, I just went in whatever direction I could. I didn't look over my shoulder, either, because I could hear it's tentacles crashing against the floor behind me. Even worse this time around was how the thing's gurgling noises actually echoed, which made me imagine it being much closer, right on top of me the entire time.

In the frenzy, I somehow managed to wrestle the walkie from my pocket without hurling it half across the room and mashed the button again. "Daniel! Daniel, we got trouble." I waited, still bolting into God only knew where. "Daniel!" Nothing.

I was right in the middle of trying to cry out again when I stopped suddenly, hearing the croaking noise coming around the corner just a few feet away from where I was. *Shit!* I waited for a moment, not knowing whether to run or stay put. I swung my head backwards to find a dead end with a two way crossway. The gurgling came closer round the bend. I stepped back, ready at any moment to start booking. Just when it seemed like the thing was about to jump out from around the corner, it stopped and so did I. My breath caught in my throat.

*God, just go away...* I pled silently. *Please, God, make it go away...*

God appeared to have my back, too, because sure enough, the gurgling noise trailed further and further away. Even still, it was at least a good five to ten minutes before I felt safe enough to move again. The first thing I did was to arch my neck as much as possible without moving to peek around the corner. The coast was clear for the moment, so I took the chance to *slowly*, tiptoeing like I was a kid trying to sneak in the house past curfew, walk back through the tunnel the way I thought I came from.

Like I said, the coast was clear, but there was a new problem. I didn't know at all where the hell I was. I lost the creature, but now I don't know where to go next or at least how to get back to the quarantine room. I fumbled with the walkie again.

"Daniel! Daniel, Goddamn it, pick up!" Nothing. I kept clicking the call button, but I could hear only interference. *Just fuckin' wonderful, don't that just beat all? I have no idea where I am, where I am, and no fuckin' signal.* After taking a deep breath, hitting the wall next to me, I opened my eyes and started walking forward. I stayed going down the tunnel I was in for another meter or two before taking a right into a tunnel that was probably the only one down here that was actually "roomy" as the maintenance guy put it.

It was also the only one that was semi well lit, using overly bright fluorescent lighting that lined the length of the ceiling. At either side of me along the walls were large panes of glass that appeared to peer into what looked like either an aquarium or *some* sort of water tank. It was bright green with small bubbles rising from the bottoms and in the middle, were these weird little... *things* \-- I can't really describe them as anything other than "things" -- that were suspended from long black cables that dangled from the tops of the tanks.

They just dangled there, like fishing worms, until my dumb ass put my face up to the glass for a closer look, where the damn thing started squirming frantically, startling me half to death. *The fuck is that thing?!* It looked like it was just a tiny ball of shiny, inky black tentacles, furiously writhing around like an electric current had just been shot through it. It didn't have any real features, either, just about ten or twelve tiny wiggling appendages coming out of everywhere on it's body. In a weird way, it kind of reminded me of those koosh balls I used to play with when I was a kid, only those didn't make me sick to my stomach when the little silicone bristles moved like this thing did with its tentacles.

Worse yet was when I looked over at the other tanks to see that the others were now writhing as well. It was like I'd disturbed the one, which then made the others lose their shit as well, like how when there's two babies in a room and one starts wailing, prompting the other to do the same. Basically, I'm saying that these things apparently had some kind of psychic connection and could tell when something was wrong. I guess I was either too curious or too grossed the fuck out though for htis to fully kick in. That is, until I heard the pitter-patter of tendrils stabbing the floor in a beeline for the tunnel I was in.

That was my one and only warning to get going, so I immediately started hauling ass once again for the other end of the corridor. One problem though -- there wasn't any exit. I made it all the way to the other end of the hallway, only to find a small maintenance locker. I threw my head back, wondering if I could chance trying to run back out the way I came, but it was no good. Two seconds after I turned my head, I watched one of the tentacles slither into the entry of the tunnel. *Shit!*

I froze for a single second longer, long enough for two more of the tendrils to come shooting out of the hall leading in, before instinct kicked back in and I climbed into the, thankfully empty and big enough (though obviously still uncomfortably cramped as hell), locker. Through the slits, I watched the creatures -- there were TWO this time -- lumber into the room. One of them had at least three of the primary tentacles coming out of the poor bastard's *mouth*, with his body just dangling down from it like a stuck pig in a meat locker. It was absolutely disgusting and I would've puked right then and there if I wasn't worried about making sure they didn't see me.

They slithered close to the tanks and made their gross little gurgling noises to both themselves and to the glass. *Must be talking to each other,* I figured. A mating call maybe? Though, looking back, if I could take a guess, I'd say it was more of a *feeding* call than anything else. An alert that yet another human being was in their ranks and NOT one of them. This idea would make sense because in another moment, the really disgusting one started looking around the room, using the tentacles to start tossing the area like it was the FBI on a drug bust. They seemed eager, too, judging from the way its gurgling noises sounded now more like howls of frustration. They knew I was there, and I had a bad feeling it wouldn't be long before one of them decides to think checking the locker. What was I gonna do then? Not a damn thing, that's what.

I couldn't fight them, there was no way to get past them both to outrun them, and to top it *all* off -- I STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IN FUCKING HELL I WAS! The one got right up against the locker, gazing around, examining the vents. Think of any scene from any movie where the hero is trying to hide from the monster and the monster gets right up to where they're hiding, trying to make 'em crack and come out by sniffing around for them. It was *just* like that. God had my back again, though, because the fucker didn't seem to want to linger around long before joining his partner.

The two of them started gurgling back and forth to one another, "talking to each other" I guess you could say, before one of them shot one of their tendrils through the glass, shattering it. The other immediately followed suit, shattering the other one. In seconds, water filled the tunnel almost halfway already. Before I could even realize anything that was happening, I could feel the water seeping through the cracks of the locker.

In only a few MORE seconds, the water inside the locker was up to my thighs. *Oh great, so if I'm not taken out by them, I'll get DROWNED out!* Through the slits again, I saw the creatures, both the one's WITH bodies as well as the small ones inside the water tanks, slither away into the hallway, treading the water as they went along. By that point, the water -- which I might add was almost numbingly cold, to a point where I had actually lost feeling in both my lower legs -- had reached above my kneecaps, yet still, I waited at least another half a minute after the creatures were gone before finally clamoring out of the locker.

Wading through the flooded tunnel, I looked to see the empty tanks. Water was still steadily pouring in from them, running all throughout and out of the tunnel. I made my way to the hallway and peered around the corner. Seeing that the coast, for the time being anyway, that *I* could see, was clear, I scrambled for the walkie again and decided to try my luck with it again. "Daniel! Come on, you son of a bitch, PICK UP!"

Static.

By that point, I was ready to hurl the damn thing, but instead I clipped it back to my pocket, took a deep breath, and started forward again, staying cautious to make as little noise as possible. At first, my plan was to try following the flow of the water that was quickly flooding the rest of the tunnels, only to realize about twenty minutes in that this was a fruitless endeavor thanks to just how many diverting tunnels there were. None of the pathways seemed recognizable to me either. Then, before losing myself any deeper, I decided to turn around and turn back toward the tunnel I came from.

I figured, being that that was where whatever those things are were being born, grown, germinated, whatever, that that must also be close to the Chem labs. If so, then that meant I should be able to find a way out through there and use the Chem Labs to make it through to the main office. The walk back took longer than it did going forward, mostly thanks to the fact that my body was now shivering with every step, plus the anxiety not allowing me to try walking any faster than 2 miles per hour. Eventually though, I made it back to the tunnel, where I started searching for any sort of entry out of there and to the surface.

The maintenance guy HAD said that there were hatches to each area of Site 46, so I knew it'd have to be *somewhere* in that tunnel. After all, how the hell else did they manage to access it to hold, examine, test, and/or whatever the hell else those motherfuckers were doing with them? Of course, this inevitably led to my mind questioning once again just *what* the fuck were these things and what were they doing with them? Up to that point, you know, I'd all but shoved the question to the back of my mind, but after seeing what I had earlier in that tunnel, I couldn't help but really start wondering.

How long had these things even *been* here, or were they just some new development? What about all the times other crew members from various wings of the facility had been called to the Chem Labs for test work? Had *they* been subjected to these things? I mean, it doesn't seem likely, given that this was, as far as I knew at least, the first time anything like this had ever happened, but then...

*Could they have been subjected to these things, too?*

I'll tell you, it was everything I could do and beyond to keep shoving down my questioning and just focus on finding my way out of the damn tunnels. I looked all around the corridor but found nothing except the storage locker. Then I looked inside the empty tanks that held the creatures and decided to try my luck looking there. I have to say, I was both shocked and a bit alarmed when I actually ended up finding what I was looking for here. Located at the top of the tank, right above where the thing was being held by the cables earlier, was a large hatch door.

Now, I say alarmed because automatically, I realized there was only one reason for this. Think about it, of all locations in the tunnel, why right inside of the tank above the thing? Okay, so playing "benefit of the doubt", you could say that it was for feeding or something, right? Except then, why was it large enough to admit a grown man? That left me with only one conclusion, as well as an answer to my earlier question. They *HAD* been exposing others to this thing before, which meant that either they'd encountered this situation before and had implemented some sort of way of terminating them before they'd get out of control like they were now, or the people they'd tested were somehow immune to these things and their effects, OR...

*Or these things knew how to be patient inside of people.*

This made the entire inside of my body drop below zero. If these things could linger inside of people, then how did I know who was infected and who wasn't? How did I know that *I* wasn't infected? Granted, I hadn't exactly been stabbed or anything, but even still, how did I know if that was their *only* way of infesting their victims?

I came out of the tanks and entered into the main testing room of the Chem Labs. The room was mostly dark, which made trying to see a damn thing almost impossible. The only light in the room came from the teeny tiny little red lights peppered across the ceiling in the four corners of the room that just barely even lit the small radii around them. That said, there was still a good bit that I *could* see; namely the many papers lining the wall. From what I could really make out, most of them were weird sort of diagrams, either of people, animals, or of other things that looked both recognizable and unrecognizable at the same time.

I focused hard, though, on the ones I saw that depicted, or at least seemed to depict, the creatures. In the diagrams, I saw people appearing to be exposed to them via pricking. A lot of the handwriting was both sloppy and illegible, but some of it, I saw, read:

**"Specimen X-12: chemical engineered symbiote."**

I grabbed a few of these documents off of the wall and began looking over them in the light as best I could. Here's one of the files I managed to read in entirety.

\*\*\*

# "Monolith file 336-556-9: 'Project Anti-venom'"

**"Specimen X-12 is a chemically engineered symbiote. Purpose: provision of enhanced antibodies into human body; effectively eliminating all diseases or ailments in the body, as well as enhancement of physical activity overall."**

**"Hypothesis: After exposure to Specimen X-12, a human host -- of any age, race, ethnicity, sex, or health condition -- will be not only cured of any and/or all ailments, thus prolonging life almost indefinitely, but will also receive major enhancements in endurance, durability, and reflexes."**

**"Method: By obtaining volunteers from various members of Monolith staff; each of varying backgrounds and/or conditions and circumstances, we will begin testing the effects of exposure to human subjects. First wave of trials shall occur the first week of every month for the next twelve to fifteen months, after which time, total results will be collected and reviewed by higher Monolith administration."**

**"During the trials, seven volunteers will be selected to undergo testing, according to the choosing of H.O.E. (Head of Experiment), individually undergoing testing once per corresponding day."**

**"Note: Human trials are to go on record as having occurred AFTER extensive animal testing (see prior documentation, dated from 2019). Trials showed extreme promise, especially in primates and other mammalian subjects. We act in good faith that such fruit will be borne with human trials."**

\*\*\*

I remember almost wanting to vomit when I read that last line. "In good faith". Yeah, because horrendous things NEVER happen when it's purely done "in good faith", right? These eggheaded fuckin' wingnuts experimented on PEOPLE! And don't even TRY telling me they actually told them what the fuck they were actually taking part in, not with how secretive those fuckheads were. No, I'll bet they told them they were getting a flu shot or a physical or some shit; something that staff was required to undergo periodically, only to find that what was *really* happening was that they were unintentional, nonconsensual lab rats.

I tried looking through the documents, but any sort of reports on the project, any other notes or "calculations" regarding the trials, must have been trashed long ago or taken when the place was hurriedly evacuated, which would explain also the way the room was trashed. I guess they left these few documents; the diagrams and the introduction, as a sort of "fail safe", in case they managed to diffuse the situation and return to the laboratory and salvage some record of the project.

Well, in an ironic way then, I guess they can thank me for that because I then pocketed the documents before making my way to the door at the far end of the room. Turning the knob, I felt every joint in my body seize up at once when I heard the now all too familiar croaking sound coming from right outside the door. *SHIT! I can't get to the main office with that thing right on top of me**!*
