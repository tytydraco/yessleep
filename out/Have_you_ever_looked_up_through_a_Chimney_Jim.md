Her question was absurd, and I had half a mind to walk over and pull my wife’s head out of the damn chimney by her feet.

Against my better judgement, I suppressed the impulse.

Doreen hasn’t been the same since we lost Junior. We both haven’t. I’m a patient man, too. I can tolerate a lot of heartache. That said, her new obsession had been taking a toll on me.

I’m used to discomfort. It wasn’t discomfort that was the problem, though.

It was what she was finding comfort in that rattled me to my marrow.

\------

Heard her before I saw her that first night.

I was on the porch, nursing some bottom-shelf whiskey and listening to the crickets chirp, planning on passing out where I sat. A new nightly ritual as of the last few weeks. Nothing else to do, really. No one to talk to except for Doreen. Unfortunately, though, my wife and I hadn’t been talking much in the wake of everything. In the first few weeks after his passing, I’d talk to her, but it’s tough to converse with something that gives you nothing in return.

You see, she hadn’t spoken a word since Junior’s death. A lot of wailing, but no actual language. Not a peep. Four months, three weeks, and six days of wordlessness. "*Expressive mutism*" is what the doctor called it.

Which only made the first words she said in months that much worse.

Hollering like a smoke alarm, she asked me that goddamned question from somewhere inside our home.

*“Have you ever looked up through a chimney, Jim?”*

I sprinted inside, the front door slamming behind me, face flushed from the booze and the exertion. Not sure what I expected to see, honestly. But, room to room, I didn’t see her anywhere. She had been practically bed bound for weeks, and now, somehow, she had vanished.

That really put some jet fuel into my veins. The blood pumping through my heart was almost painful; felt sludgy, like it really had turned into black, viscous fuel. Before I could truly start to panic about her whereabouts, I heard her speak again.

*“This is probably what it looked like through Junior’s eyes, right before he passed.”* shouted my wife, voice muffled.

She was much closer than I expected, so her shout startled the hell out of me.

I peered over the couch in our living room, following where the sound had come from, and there she was. Head, neck, and shoulders in the chimney. Her torso and legs spilled out of the fireplace like a forked tongue from the devil's open mouth.

*“Have you ever looked up through a chimney, Jim?”* she shouted again, her voice coarse and cracking from how loudly she was projecting the question.

Call me a shitty husband, but I didn’t respond.

I just walked away, up the stairs, into our bedroom, and closed the door. Took my whiskey to bed like I was having an affair.

All the while, Doreen kept asking that singular question. Screaming the words so loud that I could hear her from where I was.

\-----

In the weeks after his passing, Doreen was practically catatonic. I think it was the nature of Junior’s death that utterly preoccupied her. I understand why - it preoccupied me too. No one could tell us how he died. The medical examiner blamed his heart, but that’s because he couldn’t find anything else on the autopsy, other than a rash and a few strangely shaped scars we didn't have an answer for.

How could that man, with all his training, not tell me how our son died? How my only boy passed on from this life? It felt so…cruelly anticlimactic.

Junior was our lives, and he had so much promise. How could he just give out like an old radiator? His death didn't match his value in life. It was like someone trying to force me to believe that two plus two equalled eleven. It just didn't add up. There was no equilibrium to it.

Made it hard for our minds to compute and understand.

I suppose the ambiguity of it all was eating away at Doreen. Not that she ever told me that specifically. It’s a bit of an assumption on my part, based on her behaviors before she disappeared.

\-----

When I woke up that next morning, the house was quiet. I figured my wife had tuckered herself out from whatever insane fit she had been having, but I was sorely mistaken.

I found Doreen in the kitchen, standing like a statue in front of an empty wall. Between her and the wall, there was a Pringles can that she had popped the bottom out of, and she had her left eye looking through it like a telescope. Except she wasn’t looking at anything. She was leaning her face forward so hard that she didn’t even need to hold up the can. Doreen had created a tight seal between her eye and the wall, which I assumed was pitch black on the inside; a disturbing kaleidoscope to nothing and nowhere.

But that’s not what she saw, apparently. Instead, she told me; she was seeing into the afterlife. She didn’t call it the afterlife, though. My wife didn’t call it heaven, or the great beyond, or any other pleasant euphemism for the end of existence.

Doreen called it *‘the depths’*.

And according to her, she was looking right at Junior. He was standing with *his* eye pressed against the other side of the can, looking right back at her from where the wall was.

In not so many words, Doreen explained that if she couldn’t know how he died, she at least wanted to know what his last moments looked like - what he saw *as* he was dying. That’s what made her look through the chimney in the first place, apparently. And when she did, it made her feel closer to Junior. She was consumed by experiencing what our son had as his vision faded. What it looked like when the world became distant, and darkness started closing in.

And that’s how she found him.

When I slapped the can away from her, begging her just to talk to me about how she felt, she scurried away. Laid down and slid her head back into our fireplace.

As much as I tried, I couldn’t coax her back out. When I finally did attempt pulling her out, she screamed like a rabid animal, shaking and seizing like I was somehow hurting her. When I couldn't watch any longer, I let her scamper back into her original position.

Didn’t want to call the cops, they would have just institutionalized her. Thought about an ambulance, too.

But I was angry. At her, the world, and God most of all.

So, I left her there.

She didn’t move for days, and she kept asking me the same question, day and night. Loud, happy, horrible shouts.

*“Have you ever looked up through a chimney, Jim?”*

I never responded, but that didn’t seem to bother her much.

The question felt almost rhetorical.

Like she was just marveling at whatever she was seeing, rather than earnestly asking me a question.

\------

One day, I watched her skitter up the chimney, her body rapidly disappearing into the fireplace’s black maw, nails audibly scratching against the brick.

*“I think I found him, Jim!”* she proclaimed.

And then, there was nothing.

Doreen didn’t crawl out the top, nor did she fall back down to the bottom. She was just…gone.

Last night, I put my head down over the kindling and looked up, unsure of what else to do now that my wife was gone and the whiskey had run out.

Honestly, I think I did see what Doreen was talking about. The sky was like a faraway, peaceful movie that was fading from view.

But that wasn't all.

Eventually, if I squinted, I began to see a curve in the chimney - a tunnel. Halfway up, folding off the path like an exit on the interstate. I wasn’t sure how I’d get there. As I tried to pull myself up, however, thousands of tiny black hands sprouted from spaces between the bricks, helping me up and into the chimney.

Maybe that’s where Doreen and Junior are, I thought, as the cavalcade of hands pushed me further up, towards the curve.

When I approached, I got a glimpse into it.

The tunnel that coiled forward off the curve seemed to go on forever. As it did, the brick of the chimney slowly transitioned into continuous red rock that pulsed and squished with some internal current. The smell that emanated from it was simultaneously enticing and revolting; floral and deathly, like a pot of lilacs growing out of rotting pork instead of dirt.

And if I angled my head just right, I saw him.

At the very end of that coil, miles and miles away, I saw Junior.

But he was angry at me.

He shook his head in disapproval, and the black hands let go. Dissolved into nothingness. I fell ten or so feet down onto the kindling, breaking my wrist in the process. Snapped the damn thing to pieces.

Doreen must have learned something in the last few days. Something that allowed her to be accepted by Junior, unlike me. Something I still had to learn.

Maybe it just takes time.

Practice makes perfect, after all. And it only took a few days of practice for Doreen to find The Depths.
