Okay, this story happened a while ago. Around a month or two. I was on my way to work at a regular 9 - 5 office job, but something was off. I took a taxi to my work, but it seemed odd. The taxi driver had a unhumanish face and kept talking about this website called “thispersondoesnotexist”. Almost the second I walked into the car he locked the doors and not once stopped talking about thispersondoesnotexist.com. No matter how many times I asked him why he wanted me to try it out so much, he never answered. Though right before I left, he said “only use the website once. DO NOT refresh the page”. Anyways, I didn’t think about it much. Basically thispersondoesnotexist is a website that generates a realistic human face, but the person doesn’t exist. It sounded pretty interesting, so I decided to try it out. 

I repeatedly refreshed the page and generated hundreds of new faces. After around an hour, I came across something disturbing.

 I refreshed the page and a picture of me came up. I couldn’t move. I felt the cold air around me. In the span of two seconds it went back to normal and it felt as if nothing happened. I forgot about this incident for about a year or two, until something happened. 

I was taking a taxi, as normally. But I saw the same distorted taxi driver that I saw a year ago. Something was telling me to run but I didn’t. I stayed. 

I went in the creatures taxi, but this time he did not say anything about the website. Instead, he drove on for longer than needed. I asked “sir we were supposed to arrive 10 minutes ago”. It’s response was “we will be there soon”. The doors were locked so I could not escape. After around an hour I could not take it anymore. I screamed and grabbed for the drivers neck but he turned around in less than half a second. His eyes were gone and he had a wide grin with blood dripping down it’s mouth. The car started to rapidly speed up even though the drivers hands were not on the wheel. The windows shut and I felt like throwing up. 10 seconds later, the driver replied “we arrived”. I walked out the car to see an old house, which had looked to be there for years. I walked inside and froze out of fear.

 There was a single computer. The computer looked as if it was from the early 2000’s and the rest of the room was completely empty. I stood next to the computer which had the website “thispersondoesnotexist” on it. 

The driver was right behind me holding on my shoulder with an iron grip. I refreshed the page and saw a live view of myself and the driver behind me. The driver then yelled in a robot type voice “you were not supposed to exist”. It all went black and I felt as if I was getting crushed by a car. I woke up in my bed the next day. But one thing was off. I looked in the mirror and saw my face had no eyes, and a wide grin dripping blood.
