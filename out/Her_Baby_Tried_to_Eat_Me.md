Listen—I need you to believe me. Somebody must. The cops don’t. The mother—if you can call her that—looked at me like I was the monster. But it wasn’t me. It was her baby.

Yeah. Her baby.

It happened at the Dartmouth Mall. One of the last half-dead malls clinging to life. I like the vibe there. Feels like stepping into 1999, all neon and stale popcorn. I was chewing through an overpriced pretzel when I noticed the stroller parked outside the body lotion store.

No mother in sight.

I figured she’d be back in a second. Five minutes went by. Ten. I drained my lemonade. Still no sign of her.

That’s when my gut told me something was off.

I walked over to the stroller. Big mistake.

See, I was studying to be an elementary school teacher. I liked kids. Loved them, actually. Past tense.

The stroller was draped with a ratty blanket, half-covering whatever was inside. I heard nothing, so I leaned in and tried to be gentle.

“Hey there, baby… you okay?”

That’s when it growled.

Not a coo. Not a whimper. A deep, vibrating growl, like a pit bull warning you to back the hell up. My first thought was: somebody shoved their dog in there. Weird, but not impossible.

Still, I had to look. I pulled the blanket back.

It lunged.

The thing clamped onto my index and middle fingers with jaws like a bear trap. One second they were there, the next… gone.

I screamed so hard it felt like I tore something in my throat. The mall froze. Everyone turned.

And then she showed up. The mother.

She looked like Martha Stewart crossed with Elvira—pearls and menace.

“What did you do?” she hissed.

“It bit me!” I held up what was left of my hand. Blood poured like ketchup from a squeeze bottle.

She didn’t even flinch. “A baby—my baby—wouldn’t bite anyone who didn’t deserve it.” Then she reached into the stroller, through the blanket.

I braced myself for a dog, or some mutant thing.

Nope.

She pulled out a blond, rosy-cheeked baby. A normal damn baby.

“Look at my hand!” I shouted. “Something in that stroller bit my fingers off!”

Her eyes narrowed. “You’re crazy. Or high. You on meth?”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My head was spinning. My hand was a mangled mess. None of this made sense.

I tore the blanket away with my good hand. The stroller was empty. Just a bottle. Nothing else.

That’s when mall security arrived.

“What’s happening here?”

“This girl bit her own fingers off and tried to hurt my baby,” she said, calm as ice.

“What? Why the hell would I bite my own fingers off?”

The guard didn’t care. “Ma’am, I’m going to need you to come with me.”

“I’m bleeding out!” I screamed.

And then it hit me. The blood loss, the shock. The world tilted. Right before I blacked out, I saw the baby’s face again.

Its eyes weren’t blue. They weren’t brown.

They were solid black.

I woke up cuffed to a hospital bed. Cop at my side. They said it was “for my own good” until the mother decided whether to press charges.

I told them the story. The same one I just told you.

They ordered drug tests.

So now I’m down two fingers. And somewhere out there, a black-eyed demon baby is still hungry.
