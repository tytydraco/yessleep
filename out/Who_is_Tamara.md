I am scared. I don’t know what to do. It’s been happening for the last three days - I have even contacted the cops, but he’s literally only here when the cops aren’t. He is very careful - not even my neighbours have seen him, but at least they saw a suspicious looking car, which made me look sane in front of the police.

I am just a normal citizen of this country. I go to my workplace (I am a cashier at a nearby convenience store), pay my taxes, hand-pick 2-3 friends and live in my mother’s house. She has given the house to me and has gone for a trip with her friends.

It was friday. I had taken the entire weekend off and had decided to stay in all day long, watch some movies- maybe order some pizza. My mother would be coming home soon, so I didn’t want to waste this opportunity and relax to the fullest.

Having just come from the supermarket with a bag full of chips and soda, I slumped down on the sofa and started the television. I spent the next few minutes deciding on what to watch and finally decided on one of my most favorite movies of all time - Shutter Island. Some people didn’t like the twist at the end, but oh my god did I love it. I felt like I truly understood Di Caprio’s Teddy.

Halfway through the movie my door knocked. I live in my mom’s house and the house is in a pleasant yet lonely neighbourhood. Our neighbourhood had only 3 houses, with a garden of our own. A ten minute walk down a small road opened up near the main road from where we connect to the city.It is beautiful though. Lush greeneries surround us with a touch of modern architecture.

One of our neighbours had gone on a world tour so their house was currently vacant. Not that I care particularly. They were noisy. Every time I went by their house I could literally quite hear their loud moaning.But they weren’t bad people either. It was fun hanging out with them sometimes. Just having a respite from the lovey-dovey couple, from whom I get relationship complex, seemed good enough.

My other neighbours were an elderly couple. They usually just kept to themselves. They were good people. Polite and good to look at. I really hope to find someone who will stay with me till the end and end up being like them.

Since our house was situated a little away from the main road, I had expected the elderly couple to have come knocking. They might have brought me some homemade food -they were really sweet in that manner.

I opened the door to an unknown man. He was tall, bulky and had long hair falling down till his shoulder. The way he kept his hair, a lot of his facial features were hidden, but you could clearly see his expressions. Since it was night time, his total appearance looked scary to say the least.

“Yes…?” I asked, keeping the door inclined and only showing my head.

“I am looking for Tamara. Is she here?” he asked in a deep voice.

Huh, that’s a name I had heard for the first time. Thinking that this might be a mistake I replied - “I don’t know any Tamara. Maybe you’ve got the wrong address.” and proceeded to close the door.

The man pushed against the door slightly, making me unable to shut the door. I immediately got scared at that moment. If that man decided to come in forcefully, I couldn’t in any circumstances help myself.

“I am here for Tamara. I know she’s here.” He said in his deep voice.

“I am sorry I really don’t know any Tamara.” I squeaked. Seeing that he was in no mood to back off I gathered some courage and spoke up “If you do not leave at this very moment, I will call the cops.”

That luckily seemed to do the trick. The man looked confused a little, then turned and walked towards his car. I waited until he was long gone and made sure that I locked my doors. Slumping down on the sofa, I could hear my heart beating. I was sure that the man might come in to assault me or rob me.

I called my friend that night, asking her if I should be concerned and maybe alert the cops. She was unexpectedly really calm and told me to cool down. She said that maybe it was literally a mistake, because if the guy really wanted to he could have barged in and done whatever he wanted - it’s not like anyone was really around to stop him.That made sense and I took a deep breath. Maybe I was thinking too much. I laughed and decided that it’s time to go to sleep. Unexpectedly I had a pretty good sleep. Little did I know that it would be my last peaceful sleep in a long time.

The next day went pretty normal. I went to the supermarket, brought groceries, had a long walk in a nearby park. Even though I was a little shaken from last night’s incident, I convinced myself that it was okay.

This was second night in a row staying alone. Only 2 more days before my mother gets home. This time I put on a different movie - Shawshank Redemption. Again a classic. I know I know. But what can I do I just love the old classic movies.

While watching the movie, I fell asleep. I woke up to the sudden pounding on my door. Startled I checked the time- 12:33 A.M. This was no time for anyone to come knocking at my door. Scared, I got up and grabbed hold of the nearest weapon type thing near to me - a vase.

Slowly I walked towards the door. I looked through the eyehole to see a man with a black hoodie on. It was raining outside, and with our street lights flickering I would be lying if I said he didn’t look scary.

“Who are you?” I said from inside, with a squeaky voice.

“I need to talk to Tamara.” Came the same deep voice from yesterday.

“I told you I don’t know any Tamara. Stop harassing me or I will call the cops.” I said in my most threatening voice, which still came out a little weak.

The man outside just grunted in response and I saw him leaving. After about a minute I dared to open my door, and luckily he wasn’t there no more.

I rushed inside my house, and locked the door tightly. Wrapping my blanket around me I called my friend again. I couldn’t reach her. Scared I tried to call my mom, but to no avail. Her phone seemed switched off.

I was debating on whether I should call the cops or not when I heard a bang. It was the kind of noise when someone tries to force the way through the back door.

Immediately I rung 911.

“Hello. 911.”

“Someone’s trying to enter my house, I don’t feel safe. Please I live at ABC Streets just sideways from the main J.K Road.”

“Yes ma’am. Do not panic. We will send our units immediately. Stay on the line.”

Just then the banging had stopped. Had he left? I was so scared that I just wanted to lock the room and hide inside my blanket. But the logical side of me knew that even if I lock the room it’s just a matter of minutes before he will breach through my room door.

So I picked up my late grandmothers cane (which is always next to my bed), and slowly started down the stairs. The lights were dim, and my heart was starting to beat faster. Reaching the ground floor I looked around. Everything seemed normal- no signs of intrusion.

Taking a deep breath I made my way to the back door. Slowly I walked trying to make sure that I made no noise. Entering the room to my back door, I gasped.

The back door was broken open!

“Ma’am? Are you all right?” Came the voice from the 911 call.

“He’s already inside. Please come fast.” I whispered in a rushed tone.

“Ma’am the troops are on their way as we speak. I would recommend you to hide yourself someplace safe till then.”

A loud clank came from the kitchen. The sound made by a steel utensil falling. Startled I turned towards the noise.

“Yes I will” I replied to the call but instead made way to do the opposite. There wasn’t actually any place for me to hide. My mom never had the need to make a safe room. And my house isn’t that big either - only two storeys with 2 rooms on the top.

The only place where I could hope to hide till the cops came was the attic. But to reach the attic I had to go up to my mothers room upstairs. To do so would require me going the hallway. And if he sees me, there’s no use in hiding up there.

For the first time tonight, I felt my heart beating get in control. Somehow I was feeling confident and felt in control. Taking deep breath I grasped the cane as tightly as I could and walked towards the kitchen.

What I saw shook me to the core. Not only was the utensil fallen on the floor, but on the wall in front of me was written in bright red paint - *“I see you”.*

I trembled with fear. This was not just any robbery or such. He was out here for me. He was out to get me.

My breathing became shallow, my heart beat faster. Frantically looking around I saw a long knife. This situation had no use for my grandma’s cane, instead it called for drastic measure. I had to protect myself until the cops showed up.

“Please hurry”, I whispered into my phone.

“Yes ma’am. Just a few more minutes and we’ll be there. Hold out until then” said the responder.

Slipping the phone into my pocket, I gripped the knife hard. Slowly I moved forward. I had a simple enough plan - get to the front door as quietly as possible and make a run for it outside.

As I walked towards the hallway leading upto my front door I hear a laugh. A menacing laugh from behind me.

“Hahaha. Where do you think you are going?”

I turned back sharply keeping my knife in front of me when I finally saw him. It was the same guy from yesterday. With his same stern features and long hair covering his face. But there was one difference. He had a gun.

I screamed and started running the hallway and reached the front door. In front of the door I saw my shoe-rack blocking my way horizontally. I couldn’t open the door, I would first need to clear my way which would definitely take some time. And time was one thing I clearly didn’t have. He was there, just three to four steps behind me.

I turned towards him again, my knife in front of me. I knew there was no way out of here. But there is always something, and I needed to buy some time to think.

“Who are you” I asked him in a trembling voice, hoping to start a dialogue and gaining enough time to come up with an escape plan.

“You know me. It’s time you come with me” said the man in a threatening voice.

“I don’t know you. Leave me alone. The cops are on their way” I responded back with a slightly increased confidence.

That seemed to do the trick, as the man in front of me seemed concerned for a moment. Taking advantage of the pause I spoke further, “Just let me go and no one will have to know what happened today.”

But to that he just smiled, he seemed to have regained his composure. “The cops being on their way, it seems like I don’t have much time then”, and he advanced towards me in a rushed manner.

I had a plan ready till then. I knew he wouldn’t just let me go. But there was still another way out of here, a way I should have taken at the start itself. Screaming I raised my knife and slashed it across his face. He got his arms just in time, but screamed as blood gushed from his arms.

Startling him, I saw an opening and dashed past him. He in turn screamed even louder and I could hear him running behind me.

Without looking back, I ran as fast as I could, knowing that if I even halter for a tiny millisecond, I was done for. My mind was focused only on reaching the back door. That was the way he had forced himself inside my house. And that way was still open. That was my way out.

But as was with my bad luck this evening, I placed my foot on a glass utensil which was fallen on the ground in the kitchen. My stride broke and I fell to the ground. I could see the chances of me surviving fading away.

I groaned as I looked up. The man was standing above me, breathing heavily. He had a dark look in his eyes, he obviously didn’t like my little attempt at escaping.

“This is it” he said in a hoarse voice, “no more running.” He sheathed his gun which baffled me. But my hopes were short lived as he instead reached for his pouch, slung on his hips. From inside it he took out what looked like an injection.

“What are you doing?” I finally spoke up in fearful manner. Whatever was gonna happen to me, I was getting the feeling that death was probably easier.

“Shush now,” he responded in a calmer voice, which just made him seem more menacing, “you’ve troubled me a lot, and it’s time you go to sleep. It’s all for the best.”

He started filling the injection vial with some sort of drugs. Was this the end for me? I didn’t want to imagine what would happen to me once I become his captive. My mind began racing fast. I could see bits of glass shattered near to me, the same glass I had stepped foot upon.

Very slowly, so as to not garner his attention, I moved my hand towards the glass. He was murmuring something that I couldn’t make out, but he definitely seemed agitated, like he wanted everything to be over as soon as possible.

Just as soon as he finished injecting the vial and turned towards me, I garnered up all of my remaining strength and lunged forwards, stabbing his left leg with the glass piece. It was with so much force that not only did I manage to push the entire glass piece inside, but my palm also tore apart.

He fell down on his knees screaming, dropping the vial with him, which shattered into tiny pieces. I scrambled backwards and managed to get on my feet. The pain was too intense to ignore, but the adrenaline in me rushed like never before. For the first time today, I had an escape route. The backdoor was open and my attacker was on the ground. It was now or never.

Gritting my teeth I started moving forward, the pain intensifying. Taking support of the wall, steadily I reached the door, the fresh night air slapping my face. I turned around for one last look. The attacker was still laying down on the ground, blood all around him. He was groaning in pain, far greater than I could imagine. It looked like he had tried moving forward too, but the glass had most probably injured his leg for good.

I stepped outside, finally escaping this night of madness. The cops weren’t here yet, but it would only be a matter of time. I needed to go someplace safe, but there was nothing nearby.

I could see some dim lights on in my elderly neighbours house. Setting my mind on it, I made way towards it.

“Don’t go” screamed the man from inside. “You forget. Get BACK HERE”

What did he mean by I forget? It just seemed like a ruse to help himself. Not giving him a second thought I limped ahead.

Within a few minutes I reached the neighbours safely and knocked their door. Were they sleeping? They were certainly old, so I hoped hoped hoped that they wake up in time. I kept looking over my shoulder to see whether he had followed me.

“Oh my goodness”, gasped my old neighbour as she finally opened the door. “What happened to you my dear?”

“Help… me” I managed to blurt out before I fell unconscious into her frail hands and everything became black.

\--------

I woke up coughing. My vision was a little blurry as I had to shake my head a couple of times to see things clearly. My body was bruised and covered in stale blood. I was laying down on a light blue mattress.

As I took in my surroundings I saw that I was in what seemed like a glass cage. My left leg was chained to the wall. How did I end up here? I had somehow escaped his clutches.

Suddenly the light turned out, bright enough to blind me for a few seconds. As I managed to open my eyes I saw my old neighbour standing outside the glass cage.

“Hello darling,” she started in a sly voice, no hint of her previous friendliness. “I hope you are comfortable.”

“Why am I here?” I asked, noticing how sore my throat felt.

The neighbour just smiled at that. Then she raised her frail hand and pointed behind me. I turned.

There sat my attacker. His left leg bruised extremely badly, but bandaged. He had a long knife in his hand and he looked at me. And that was definitely not a friendly look.

“I need Tamara.” He growled in a threatening voice.

I knew then and there that things were not looking good for me. And that there was a long night ahead of [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/Night_Bolt/submitted/?sort=top).
