Yeah, that may sound extreme and even a bit melodramatic, but hell if it ain’t true after a week like this one. Especially after your supervisor nixes your previously approved time off for Christmas.

Ain’t that some holiday spirit? I guess I can’t expect much better from a workaholic nepo-baby whose mysterious and uber-wealthy uncle – known only as “the Director” – founded a private paranormal research and containment group.

Let me slow my roll. I should give my intern spiel anyway.

*Here at the M.C.U.* (yeah, we’ve been C&D’d about a dozen times for that)*, we strive to make living in the Great Lakes and greater Midwest as safe and sound as humanly possible. Being a privately funded, non-government entity comprised of loving residents of this great region of the USA, we have both the know-how and motivation to keep you all out in the natural wonders of the area, without having to worry if that wailing howl during your night hike was the Beast of Bray Road or just a big ol’ bobcat! No need to bother the Feds about that frogman in your campsite or that dogman in your fields, they’d probably just shoot your dog! So give us a call if you’re in the Midwest: we’re a cut above the rest.*

Cute, huh? That’s Francis’s handiwork. He’s my supervisor, as well as the self-appointed “Chief Container” and the nephew of our hidden benefactor. I’ve never met his uncle, but Francis is a downright prick most of the time, and a bit of a milksop when it comes to the actual containing.

Damn, I hope he doesn’t see this. Oh well.

The truth of the matter is that cases are typically far more complicated than how our little blurb makes out, but I’m sure that’s no surprise to those of you in the professional working world. To be honest, I’m not even sure why we have a blurb; it’s not like we openly advertise at all.

There are a few teams all together totaling about 30 personnel, including scouts and a dedicated cleanup crew. The scouts investigate and vet any potential leads, hot spots, that sort of deal. Word has it that they answer only to the Director. Being the Napoleon that he is, Francis of course heads up what he calls the “primary team."

The usual makeup of this team is himself (team lead, of course), a striking brunette named Dasha whose our weapons specialist, a scraggly and rugged older guy named Cyrus who has a knack for building traps of all varieties, and Francis’s cryptid-sniffing German Shepherd, Brutus.

With our recent call for applicants and interns, the team now also had yours truly and two other fellow interns named Noah and Amy. Both were a few years my junior, fresh out of their small town and eager to make their names in the world of paranormal investigation. Both were firmly of the TikTok generation, doing this more for the kicks than anything else. Though to give Amy credit, at least she has a knack for actual tech work. Noah was just…well, you’ll see.

As for myself? Well, I don’t love talking about me all that much, to be quite honest. I will say it’s not fun being an intern again in my early thirties, and it’s especially not fun being desperate enough to answer an ad for this kinda gig, regardless of the hefty paycheck.

Anyways, y’all want to hear about the action, not my goofed-up life. You all wanna hear about why this holiday season, I’m just thankful to have my stupid head attached to my stupid neck.

I was sitting in the hold of the team’s Cessna Skycourier on the way to an out-of-the-way county in central Ohio, beads of nervous sweat making trails down my forehead. Sat next to Cyrus and opposite Dasha, I tried my best to make small talk with either to little avail. All the while Noah and Amy were busy filming their 60-second toks.

This would be my second official containment with the team. After a trial by fire with a coven of blood witches on Samhain, I was more concerned with my skin this time rather than impressing my higher-ups.

Before I could come to terms with my mortality, the transport plane lurched into its descent and in a few short minutes, came to a bumpy landing on a ranch’s makeshift airstrip. Our contact – the owner of said ranch – was already out on the porch of the main house, seemingly eager to get the show on the road.

I had just gotten the first couple of bags unloaded as per my role as an intern when Dasha waved me over.

“Forget those, leave them for the other two. Come, time to learn something, new blood!” she said with a sly half-smile.

I ignored Noah and Amy’s whines of indignation as I hustled to meet up with the rest of the main team now chatting up – or rather as I learned later from Dasha, our form of vetting – the rancher.

“...ain’t never seen the likes of it,” the rancher was bleating at Francis and Cyrus, “The sumbitch just ripped and tore the entire damn head off my prize steer and shot off like a bat outta hell into the woods!”

“Uh huh,” muttered Francis absentmindedly, jotting in his little notepad. “And you said the creature was, uhh, ‘big and gray’?”

“With ‘orrible red eyes!” the rancher exclaimed, “An’ the sumbitch had a long mane of hair round his face, but it…looked more like he had moss for hair than anything.”

“Riiight, ‘moss for hair,’ uh huh,” Francis said, keeping his eyes on his notes.

Cyrus just grumbled in confirmation.

“And lemme guess; hairy and thick in the chest, arms, all over? Real broad and built like a Ford-250?” I interjected.

The rancher’s eyes went wide. Francis shot me a death stare. Dasha giggled.Cyrus just stood still as ever.

“Hell, son. Now that ya mention it – yeah, it was allat and more!” he exclaimed.

“Alllright sir, thanks a lot for your time,” Francis interrupted, slapping his notepad shut. “I think we’ve got all we need to get to work.”

\*\*\*\*\*

The first day and half was a slog through early winter Ohio wetlands. While the light snowfall and birdsong were pleasant parts of the trek, having to deal with a pair of noisy Gen-Z’ers and an egoistic boss was decidedly less so.

Cyrus was ahead on point tracking the creature, Francis was giving me the cold shoulder, and Amy and Noah were engrossed in their own little worlds. I figured Dasha was the only one I could rely on to halfway care about keeping me alive, so I stuck close to her while we hiked through the midwestern backcountry.

It was a couple of hours to dusk when Cyrus came loping back with Brutus panting at his side. The rugged man mumbled a few quick words to Francis. It was the most I’d ever heard Cyrus speak yet I still couldn’t make out a single damn thing he said. Meanwhile, Dasha pulled the rest of us aside and Brutus ran up to give us a few licks on the hand to say hi.

“Looks like we’re stopping for the night, new blood,” she said, petting the muscular dog behind his ears. “Go on and get the camp set up there a ways.”

She pointed to a spot about a hundred feet off the game trail we were on. A small stream ran through it, and it provided enough tree cover while still allowing us enough space and elevation for any potential nighttime encounters.

\*\*\*\*

“So…it sounds like we’re all thinking it’s the same thing, yeah?” I asked that evening over dinner.

“Your job isn’t to *think*, intern,” Francis snapped, “it’s to keep lookout. These fuckers can see pretty well in the dark, better than your average humanoid cryptid. I’d rather not get caught with my dick out ‘cause the interns frigged up!”

“Hey man, you can’t talk to us like that, like we’ve got worker’s rights and–” Noah started to squeak out.

“Fuck all that! You’re not in the professional world anymore bucko,” Francis interrupted, “This is big-game hunting times a million. Shape up or die, that’s the most real advice anyone’s gonna give you in this field.”

I stayed silent. Francis had a bit of a point, even though he may have been the world’s worst motivational speaker.

Noah and Amy both started to go off about some labor union laws (not that we had a union) when Cyrus suddenly let off a tight, “head’s up” whistle. The camp immediately went silent aside from Brutus letting off low growls at the dark expanse of the woodlands beyond our roaring fire. I felt jolts of adrenaline assaulting my nerves as I placed down my stew bowl, moving with the vets into a crouching cover position behind one of the trees within our site.

I glanced at Dasha who was silently handing out the tranq rifles to everyone but Cyrus. The oldtimer was moving with a speed and silence that belied his age to arm the traps he’d set earlier. Brutus slunk down on his haunches and paced around the inner camp.

“Wh–where’s the actual *guns*, bruh?” Noah said, too loudly.

“Yeah, what the eff? You want us to take this thing alive??” Amy followed.

“Shutthefuckup,” muttered Dasha through clenched teeth.

For my part, although I was shaking like the last leaf on a windy day I was doing my best to scan the area. Francis’s harsh words from moments ago were ringing in my head as I tried to follow the rumbling grunts and swift, heavy footsteps that were now echoing around our little perimeter. When we heard the heavy prints stop just a couple dozen feet to our north, Francis motioned to be at the ready.

“The fuck are we waiting for, let’s shoot this bitch!” yelled Noah, charging forward out of his cover.

He hadn’t taken more than a handful of strides when I saw the pair of ghastly red eyes appear just to his left. A split second later, a fist-sized rock came streaking out of the darkness and cracked into Noah’s leg, dropping him to the ground in shrieks of agony.And too far away for us to help.

Sonofabitch feinted us.

“Clever girl,” I muttered, swinging my rifle around in a desperate attempt to save my fellow intern.

Dasha and Francis both followed suit, and to our credit at least one of our darts must have hit the beast ‘cause it let out a pissed-off roar before darting to the fallen, screaming Noah. Even the practiced hands of the team’s vets weren’t quicker than the legendary Ohio Grassman as it revealed itself to us for the first time.

The hulking gray-beige monstrosity snatched up the skinny intern by his busted leg and sprang back into the woods before we could fire our next round of tranqs off. Even today, I swear I saw the beast smile as it took the doomed guy into the dark.

“Goddamn it!” yelled Dasha, and even Francis grit his teeth as we heard the sounds of squelching, tearing, and chomping (thankfully Noah’s cries were cut short) echo grimly through the night.Brutus whimpered and went low to the ground.

I was frozen to my spot. My back may as well have been melded with the sycamore I was taking cover behind, hell if I was planning on moving anytime soon.

A few terrible seconds later, an ovalish object was flung into our camp from the opposite side. With a dull thud and wettish smack the object hit the side of the tree Amy was crouched behind. I couldn’t see what it was from my position, but I heard Francis whisper:

“Don’t. Look. Amy, *do. not. look*.”

It didn’t take a genius to guess what it was.

Amy must have been one of those people that my dad always called a “natural contrary,” because as soon as Francis said that she sure as shit looked. Her scream pierced the night like nails on a chalkboard as she broke cover and fled from the sight of Noah’s bloody, scalped head.

Now look, I know I’ve talked some smack about my fellow interns, but they didn’t deserve this. They’re still human beings after all. Steeling myself from a place within me that I didn’t know existed, I bolted from behind my tree to try to stop Amy, desperate to keep her from becoming the prey she was unintentionally making herself.

I was a second too late.

Just as I was about to tackle her to the leafy ground another stone whizzed out from the dark and with a sickening crack, hit the poor girl square in the spine. Her eyes went glassy as she collapsed faster than my aunt after her Christmas bottle of wine. Before the follow-up stone could blast me in the chest I threw myself to the ground with her.

We must have made tempting bait, ‘cause just as I hit the dirt the grassman leaped from the darkness into the ring of firelight, intent on making Amy and I his next meal. Or playthings. Either option made me nearly shit myself.

The beastman towered above my cowed form, his silvery-gray fur clashing terrifically with the strands of dark greenish hair hanging long from his snarling face. For a handful of nanoseconds that felt like hours, he and I stared at one another, similar yet so incomparably different. I could describe for paragraphs his honed claws and gnarled teeth, yet what I recall most was not anything physical per se, but rather how proud he looked. The pride that comes with being an apex predator that has survived countless hunts and the culling of its territory. I also recall how *angry* he looked. An anger that promised us no quarter.

I began to mutter a prayer, hoping I could at least count on a quick death.

Then Cyrus saved us all.

Right as the beast crossed the threshold of light and dark, the old man activated his sonic sound trap. I don’t know how it didn’t affect us (like I said, the man’s a savant at this stuff), but it sure as shit gave the squatch a hard pause. As it was cradling its furry head in pain, Francis, Dasha, and I fired our tranq guns in supernatural coordination. The Grassman staggered, slumped, gave us all one more hellish glare…and crumpled to the ground, out colder than my aforementioned aunt.

Dasha slank out from behind her tree, spat on the unconscious beast, and put one more dart in its nether regions for good measure.

“Not bad, new blood,” she said, giving me a quick wink, “Not bad at all.”

\*\*\*\*

I won’t bore you with the mundanity of lugging a thousand-pound Grassman out of the wilderness. We came prepared, but even the trailer and four-wheeler were hard-pressed to keep the brute stable on the trek out. For my part, I had the thrilling job of keeping the big guy nice and sedated. I kept it simple. Whenever I saw even the slightest twitch of the finger or heard the faintest growl, I immediately stabbed the fucker with a fresh pair of tranquilizers.

The plane ride back with the beast strapped down right in the middle of the cargo hold was…stressful, to put things mildly. But God must have thrown us a bone finally because we made it back to base without incident.

Miraculously, Amy survived. While Francis and I were driving the grassman out, Dasha and Cyrus carried the injured girl out on a makeshift travois. I owe that guy a beer or three by the way.

Cyrus, *not* Francis.

I thought for sure Amy wasn’t ever going to walk again but all Francis said on the matter was that the M.C.U. had access to “top surgeons and recovery resources.” Through his uncle, no doubt.

As for Noah…well…there really wasn’t much of any of him left to recover.

When we got back to base, we shipped Amy off to recover and the Grassman off to God-knows-where. Wherever the Director directs it to, I suppose.

Probably best not to question such things.

Well, I may have gotten PTSD and nightmares instead of fond memories with family and friends this Christmas, but as I said above…some days, I just have to sit back and be thankful I’m alive. The payout I got from this gig helped a bit too.

Anywho, I’d say that’s about an average day on the job here at the Midwestern Containment Unit, sans the interns turning into a gory mess. Or maybe that’s part of it too. I don’t know. Shit.

Best not to dwell on such things.

I’ll keep y’all updated on our next gig if you want. I heard talk about a haunted town and mass exorcism, or something of the sort. Sounds like a hell of a time. Until then, if I live to tell the tale, stay safe out there all.

And remember; stay grateful for the little things, because you never know when you might get ripped to shreds by a mythological beastman.
