So, I do not realy know how to get started with this so I will just start where guess what... It all started. I would like to preface this with that i never really like christman, just never have. I do not really have any special reasoning for it, for me it just never really clicked like it seams to do for most.

This chrismas i never asked for anything in particular, I never do. But still my sister as she always does would not take that for an answer and started prying more for any hints about anything I could use or would want. But still there was never anything I wanted, but she insisted on finding something. So when I went to open the presents with the family all around and the gift she got me was a smartwatch I have to admit. I was surprised on how she had gotten to that, seeing that I had been on the watch for a new one after my old one sudenly died after an accident when it hit the marble countertop in the bathroom sink just a little to hard. I very much thanked her, and the rest of the presents i got were nothing out of the ordinairy for anyone who wishes for nothing. Just the usual socks and T-shirts with lame designes.

After getting home and checking if all the clothes I had gotten fit and seperated them in to piles of things that fit and things to be exchanged to correct sizes. I went to set up the new watch and check out how it was. It is not a brand I had never heard about and didn't know nothing about, I could not be picky or anything seeing as it was a gift and I can't really complain about getting a "free" watch.

Whilst going through the setup for it there were the usual things, asking for permision to use locational data, having it synced up with my phone, and asking whether I wanted it to check my heartrate or not. But then there was an unusual one that caught me of gard with a feature I had never heard about. It simply prompted "Do you want to activate fear monitor" with yes or no buttons. I remember thinking that this must just be some sort of new thing that was being tested on these types of moddels befor making it to more know types of watches. Kind off like a bug test for users of these lesser models. So why not give it a try.

I quickly forgot about it and thought nothing of it for some time. With just the usual notifcations about high heart rates and "you should get some rest" comments coming and going here and there on the watch. Which was nothing out of the ordinary for those of you who have any type of smartwatch. But one night, I live alone so the house was empty as per usual and with nothing really happening, I was just laying on the couch watching whatever was on TV not realy thinking about it. I got the notification "Fear detacted". This caught me off guard seing as I didn't feel afraid in any way posible. I was just watching some random comedy movie that was playing and thinking about going to bed. But just seing that promt mad me feel uneasy in some kind of way. Something like the way you can feel when being watched whilst thinking you are alone. But at the end of the day I just brushed it off as nothing and went about my night going to bed with nothing happening.

The notification came up here and then giving me the same feeling more and more often here and there. And after a while i started feeling some sort of fear just seing the notifications, it felt like I was becoming paranoid over something that I knew wasent there.

Then one night, whilst laying in bed trying to drift of into sleep, I heard a sound coming from down stairs a sort of clicking noice. Like a sound of someone tapping softly on a wooden table. Then as you can guess, the notification went of again. This time I agreed with it. And i felt like i wasn't alone, like there was something or someone else in the house with me. I turned on the lights and went all around the house checking for any signs of activety, but there was nothing. As empty as always and nothing out of the ordinary. I though to my self that i was being more and more paranoid because of the watch so I just turned it off. If it was really just me being paraniod because of what the watches notifcations was saying the watch having no way of triggering my paranoia would fix that problem, and i went back to bed.

Then at around 2:54AM I was awaken by a vibration on the table next to my bed. It was the watch with the notification "Fear detacted". I thought it was strange and it truely gave me the chils. Then i heard it. the clicking again, this time closer. Way way closer. It sounded as if someone was tapping on the wall to my bedroom from the coridor. At this point I was shaking from the sudden amount of fear that had swollowed my body whole and held me captive in my bed. When the noices stopped and I had worked up the currage to go around the house again I slowly made my way throgh the house searching every room and made sure the front door was locked and all the windows were closed. Which in fact they all were from the start, i even decided to lock the door to my bedroom and tried to sleep again now putting the watch in a desk drawer and tried going to bed again. Hoping just hoping to get some more sleep befor figuring more things out in the morning, maby I needed to se a psychiatrist, but that would be tommorows problem.

Then again. It woke me, the sounds of a vibration motor activating being muffled by the materials that surrounded it. I didn't even need to get up and check what the notifcation was I allready knew what it would say. "Fear detacted". By this time I was scared shitles. My heart must have been racing at 1000 beats per minutes by this point. And in the darkest corner of my room I could bearly see 2 small glowing shadowy points which i could have sworn were eyes. But even before i could react, my bodys fight or flight instincst took over and I passed out.

In the morning when I awoke again, I quickly paced around every room in the house looking for anything that was out of the ordinary. There was nothing, absolutly nothing. I didn't even care about getting ready for work or doing anything in my reguar morning routine, I went straight to a psychiatrist which was the top result on google. I didn't even bother calling in sick for work, they would figur it out eventualy when i didn't show up. I told here everything I have just told you, every detail that i rememberd. She just chalked it up to stress indused paranoia, seeing as there was no evidence of anything truely being wrong.

She just gave me some anxiety medication and told me to try and relax more. Taught me different breathing exercises and booked an apointment for next weak to check up on me. So with all this being said. This is a warning, if you have a watch with this feature, throw it away. I allready have. I never want to se that thing again, even if it is my mind just playing tricks on me. By this point I don't know which is worse, it making me paranoid and seeing things that arent real. Or it having some sixth sense and beeing able do detect fear. Maby it is even able to detect some things we arent suposed to se. In truth, I don't want to know. I just want things to be the way they were.
