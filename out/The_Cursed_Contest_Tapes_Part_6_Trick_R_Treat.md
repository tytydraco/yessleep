&#x200B;

I hope everyone’s October is going well. Mine’s been eventful and yet also more relaxing than I expected, all things considered. The next day after I  made my last post,  Brice and Sheila bombarded me with calls and texts. I don’t mean to be rude, but Sheila can get a bit overprotective. Her mom has told me she gets it from her dad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Although, it’s understandable in this case. She and Brice managed to convince me to stay with them for a few days. I brought Herbie along who’s been doing good. However, he has gotten kind of annoying when I’m trying to research. Then he decides the most comfortable place to be is in front of my screen. I know he just wants attention and I have gotten him to jump on my lap instead.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That way he’s less obstructing.  Staying with my friends did feel good after being stuck in that town for so long. They even helped me set up my Halloween decorations so you know, that's one less thing I need to do. Unfortunately, there are things they are not able to help me with.  A case in point is a video I received the morning after they left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unlike the others, this one came in my email.  l have two. One is for personal use, friends, subscriptions, and things of that nature. The other is my job email which is supposed to be untraceable back to me. Yet, somehow the other day I found a file in it not from work or anyone I know with my full name attached.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The name of the sender was "Forgotten Friend". Before I clicked the link, I made sure to switch to one of my old shitty laptops just in case of some unforeseen hazards. Clicking it, caused a file to auto-download and in it was a single video titled “Trick "R Treat”. Below is a transcript.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[As the name implies, the events within it take place sometime in the 80s based on which costumes were most popular as well as certain commercials shown\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The main focus is a young boy, estimated age eleven or twelve, named Bobby and his dog, a German shepherd rottweiler mix called Onyx.  The events in the tape take place on Halloween and begin with Bobby on the bus ride to go home. It pulls into his neighborhood, showing houses covered in decorations and some residents sitting outside, carving pumpkins.  The bus pulls to a stop, then Bobby and some other students get off.  When he gets up to the door, arguing can be heard inside as well as a baby crying.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby hesitates for a moment and then steps inside.  The arguing appears to be financially related. In particular, it relates to Bobby’s sibling who is implied to be dealing with medical issues. The parents also talk about paying off bills having to do with their second-born child. They cease their arguing upon noticing Bobby coming into the living room.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “Is everything alright?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His mother clears her throat. Since her name is not given, she will be referred to as Bobby’s Mother, or BM for short. His father will be referred to as BF.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BM:** “Yes, sweetie we were just talking about things. How was school?”

Unfortunately, there isn't much to go on in this video. No locations or even last names are mentioned which means tracking down anyone shown in it will be difficult. I'm not sure why this one was sent to me.  Dean and Stella aren't sure either. I can't shake this idea that there's something in it that's directed at me personally.

**BM**: “Did you get any homework?”

**Bobby:** “No.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His father joins the conversation.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BF:** “That means you’re Halloween is completely free, lucky you.”

**Bobby:**  “Actually, I was wanting to talk to you guys about that.”

**BF:** “What about it?”

**Bobby:** “I wanted to spend the night at Kerry’s.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His parents consider his request.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BF:** “Well, it is a weekend. Did you and him already talk about this?”

**Bobby:** “Yeah, I told him I’d check with you both first. Then we’d go to his place after we were done trick-or-treating.”

**BM:**  “Do his parents check candy?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby groans.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “Mom!”

**BM:** “I’m just saying. You can never be too careful, nowadays. There’s some sick people out there.”

**BF:** “I’m sure he’ll be fine. Let him have his fun.”

**Bobby:** “So that’s a yes then?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He looks at his mother who caves in and reluctantly agrees.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BM:** “Alright, but be careful in the street. You know how crazy the drivers are around here.”

**Bobby:** “I will. Don’t worry.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage goes dark and then resumes, several hours later as indicated by the now-dark sky.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby is wearing a Spider-man costume and is getting ready to head out. Before he gets to the door, there is a high-pitched hum that comes from the TV.  He stops and goes to his parents to inform them that there is something wrong with their television. He gets to the kitchen where his mother is filling a bowl with candy and his father is carving a pumpkin.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “Dad?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His dad doesn’t respond.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “Dad?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He attempts to tap him on the shoulder. When his fingers make contact three is a bright spark and he is shocked. He cries out in pain and pulls his arm back.  He tries yelling for his father to no avail. Calling for his mother yields similar results.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Upon further inspection, he realizes that his parents appear to be frozen in time. Supporting evidence of this is the fact water is coming from the sink, but not flowing. Panicked now, he screams at his parents and once again is ignored.  A new noise comes from the TV, which he initially thinks is only static. Listening further, he realizes his name is being spoken.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’ll let you take a wild guess of who it was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He goes back to the television and sees the image of Ludus on the screen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Hey, Bobby, what’s the matter, cat got your tongue?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby’s breathing is rapid and he attempts to flee only to find the door stuck.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:**  “That won’t help you. Everything will return mostly to normal once our conversation is concluded. The sooner you cooperate, the sooner you can leave.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby reluctantly lets go of the knob and turns back to face the screen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:**  “What is it that you want? I don’t have any money.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus lets out a low chuckle.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I have no use for such things, but you do, don’t you?”

**Bobby:** “How do you know that?”

**Ludus:**  “My knowledge is vast. For instance, it’s not fair that your kind parents are struggling. Is it? What if I told you I had the means to help out your family?”

**Bobby:** “ Does that include, (beep)?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Presumably, Bobby is referring to his sibling. For some reason, their name is censored.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Of course, however, you can choose to decline my offer. All you have to do is say the word and you can dismiss me as a mere figment of your imagination.”

**Bobby:** “If I say no, will I ever see you again?”

**Ludus:** “You might, but I may not be able to make you the same offer. If something happens, are you okay with squandering the opportunity to prevent it?”

**Bobby:** “What game did you have in mind?”

**Ludus:** “I understand during this time of year some of your kind engage in the past time known as trick-or-treating. Is that correct?”

**Bobby:** “What about it?”

**Ludus:** “The contest would be that if you can get candy from all participating homes before midnight, you win.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby is about to say yes and stops himself by asking another question.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “What’s the catch?”

**Ludus:** “You’re more perceptive than I thought. If you must know, I would be taking a form only you can perceive for the duration of this game and pursuing you. I wouldn’t appear at the beginning somewhere I could easily get to you so don’t worry about that.”

**Bobby:** “I’d have to avoid you while trying to get to all the houses?”

**Ludus:** “Correct.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby weighs his options and draws in a breath.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “You’re on.”

**Ludus:** “Excellent, may the best player win.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus vanishes from the screen and then knocking comes from the front door. Bobby, who is in shock from what he just witnessed, doesn’t answer it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BM:** “Bobby, get the door!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby snaps out of his shock and opens it to find Kerry standing on their front porch in a Batman costume.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Kerry:** “Are you feeling okay? You look kinda pale.”

**Bobby:** “What? Oh yeah, I just have a bit of a head cold going on. I’m still good to go out. I thought we were going with a Marvel theme?”

**Kerry:** “My parents got me the wrong costume, sorry. Anyway, the others are waiting. Come on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby follows Kerry and then they head up the street to meet with their friend group. Once they are all together, they initiate trick-or-treating.  The whole time they are walking, Bobby is looking around. He does so discreetly to minimize unwanted attention to himself. At first, the game goes in his favor.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He and his friends are able to visit several homes without interruption. This changes at the fourth house.  The door opens to a woman in a fairy costume. As she passes out candy, Bobby glances past her and notices a figure standing in her home.  In short, it has the appearance of a stick figure straight out of a child’s drawing.  It waves to him. Its movements resemble something out of a flipbook animation.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now the game was truly underway. Sensing my tension, Herbie jumped onto my lap and began purring. Not taking my eyes off the screen, I scratched him behind the ears.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The lady at the door hands him a Snickers bar. He snatches it and tells her thanks, then hurries over the the next house with his friends racing after hum.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Kerry:** “Hey, Bobby, what’s the rush?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby rushes to the next home, pushing past some other kids, and rapidly pushes the doorbell, People behind complain. He apologizes and tells them it’s an emergency.  This time a man in a Dracula costume answers the door and passes out Hershy’s. Bobby gets his and checks for the stick figure seeing it now in front of the previous house.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*While it is only walking, its movement is slow.  Bobby goes to the next house, this time reaching it without having to barge past anyone else. When he gets his candy, this time a Butterifner, he once again checks on the stick figure. Its speed seems to have increased, albeit not by much. Inferring, what this means, Bobby breaks away from his friends.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Kerry grabs him by the arm.*

**Bobby:** “Let me go, now.”

**Kerry:** “No, you’ve been acting weird all night.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The rest of their friends agree with him.*

**Kerry:** “What is going on with you?”

**Bobby:** “I just need to take care of something. I promise I’ll meet up with you all later.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The stick figure is getting closer. Bobby yanks himself out of Kerry’s grasp and then sprints down the street with his friends calling after him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had an idea of what Bobby’s strategy was. I could only hope it would work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby doesn’t stop until he’s at the end of their neighborhood. For a while, his plan is successful as he is able to collect candy without being pursued by the stick figure. He even manages to collect candy at the final house where his friends happen to be at.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Kerry:** “There you are. Where have you been and why did you bail on us like that?”

**Bobby:** “Sorry, it’s a long story, but now let’s head to…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He stops and his breathing increases. The stick figure is still after him only this time it’s significantly faster.  In addition to this, its limbs have also grown and have a noodle-like quality.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** “I-I don’t understand.”

**Kerry:** “What? Dude, quit acting weird.”

*Bobby suddenly gasps.*

**Bobby:** “My house.”

**Kerry:** “Huh?”

**Bobby:** “How could I forget about my own fucking house?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Before Kerry can inquire about anything else, Bobby is down the street once again. This time the stick figure is not far behind. He nearly gets hit by a car. The driver slams on the brakes and honks their horn at him which he pays no mind.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Every so often, he’ll look back at the stick figure as it passes through solid objects. Judging by the scattering kids, he didn't have long until midnight.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was down to the wire. As I felt my heart rate climb, I once again petted Herbie who was also now fixated on my laptop screen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Nearly out of breath, Bobby reaches his house and bursts in through the back door. His mother is in the kitchen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BM:** "Sweetie, I thought you were going to Kerry's?"

**Bobby:** "I am, but where's the rest of the candy?"

**BM:** "Getting devoured by your father in the living room probably. Don't you have enough?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby sprints away from the kitchen with his mother yelling at him not to run. He makes it to the living room where his dad is sitting with the candy bowl in his lap. He unwraps a Reese's. He turns and smiles upon seeing Bobby.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BF:** "Hey, how'd the candy haul go? Are you still going to Kerry's?"

**Bobby:** "Dad, I need a piece of candy from you quick!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Although he is confused, his father shrugs and extends the bowl to him. As he reaches in, the stick figure's appendage closes around his wrist.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It isn't fair. He was so close. He was so goddamn close to being the one to finally win against it. As I watched in dejection, Herbie let out a sad meow. Now, all we could do was watch what horrible fate would befall Bobby.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Time slows once more. The stick figure vanishes and Ludus reappears on the TV screen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "Don't be too hard on yourself. The effort you displayed was commendable."

**Bobby:** "No, that's not fair. I got the last piece of candy before it had me.

**Ludus:** "Is that so? Then let's see those last moments. Shall we?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus is replaced with a scene showing Bobby in the stick figure. It zooms in on his hand, showing him grabbing a handful of candy right as the stick figure grabs him. Then it returns to Ludus.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "A tie then."

**Bobby:** "What does that mean for me?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus thinks about this.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "Well, seeing as how you were such a good challenge I will make you a deal. I will fulfill your desire on the condition that you pick something of vital importance to lose."

**Bobby:** "Something important?"

**Ludus:** "Correct and once it's gone nobody will have ever remembered it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Bobby glances down and sees his hands trembling.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** "What if I refuse this?"

**Ludus:** "The game has to take something away. If you don't decide I will."

**Bobby:** "Could I get some time to decide?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus is annoyed but complies with his request.  Bobby looks at his parents and then towards the stairs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** "I know what I'm going to pick."

**Ludus:** "Really? Do tell. What shall be taken away?"

**Bobby:** "Me."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't know why, but for some reason at this point, I felt something wet run down my face. I'd never been this way with any of the other tapes. Hell, I couldn't even tell you the last time I cried before that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "You? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of my offer?"

**Bobby:** "No, I wasn't planned anyway and \[Beep\] needs both of our parents. I'm…I'm okay with this."

*The person Bobby is referring to is presumably his sibling. Their name is censored. The reason for this is currently unknown.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "If that is your desire then so it shall be."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Pink light emits from the television accompanied by a hum and the room shaking. Bobby stares from his parents to the stairs once again.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bobby:** "Sorry I messed up everyone. Take care!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage goes to black. Audio can be heard of what sounds like people sobbing before also cutting out.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, there isn't much to go on in this video. No locations or even last names are mentioned which means tracking down anyone shown in it will be difficult. I'm not sure why this one was sent to me.  Dean and Stella aren't sure either. I  just can't shake this idea that something in it is directed at me personally.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Oh yeah, speaking of Stella, she was able to get a new puppy from Brice and Sheila after all which means I can at least conclude this post on somewhat of a positive note. Maybe seeing pictures of Stella and Rocky will keep me from thinking about Ludus or that Bobby kid.
