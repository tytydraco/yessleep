The renovations have finally been completed and things in the cemetery have begun to return to whatever level of normalcy I have become accustomed to.

Since the night Callahan partook in consuming the body of that contractor, he has become persona non grata among the Night Guards. Anytime he tries to insert his presence or force acknowledgment we fully ignore his presence. He has not received this treatment well and has slowly begun to either turn or return into a more demonic form.

The mouthy form running down his body opens and closes more frequently and his skin has started to take on the appearance of shale. He has also been spending more time around the howlers that congregate around the duck pond on overcast nights.

Thomas and I have been coming in at 7pm and staying until 7am to look around the cemetery for any familiar gravestones. We only work together once or twice a week so it has been a slow process. The cemetery director has been adamant about the need for another night guard and is currently spending longer days crunching the budget to add another guard. He has assured us that we will be able to work as much or little as we would desire as soon as we hire and train a fifth guard.

I still have my concerns about bringing more people in to potentially face the hunger that is never satiated. Having more guards each night, with the plan of having three every night, would make me more at ease with more living souls on patrol. However, the response to having so many people within the cemetery overnight always draws the attention of the malevolence lurking within.

Several years ago we had the worst case of the Midnight Run that I have ever experienced. It was after the Homecoming Football game against the town rivals where the home team won in a complete upset. With an 85-yard rushing touchdown by quarterback Jimmy, he was able to score as the timer ran out with a final score of 23-21. The air of immortality had been coursing amongst him, his entire team, and fatefully his crew of shitty friends. 

The chanting of “Jimmy 11, brought us to heaven” could be heard long before they entered the cemetery. Eli had no way of getting to the southeast corner to deter would-be-trespassers in time, not that I think it would have made any difference. 

Eight teens, full of youthful vigor, hopped into the cemetery with thoughts of scholarships to OSU, LSU, UMich, UGA, or UA when reality finally broke their lost potential. I had been returning to a game of chess with Mad Michael when I saw the fastest of the group run past me screaming.

Balls of magma and feathers singed his hair as branches of tar and oak ripped at his clothes and skin. Close in tow, tearing at the skin of his ankles and cloth of his shoes was a pack of mangy fish shedding their rusty nails and sweetgum balls as their claws stretched out for purchase. He could have probably made it to the fence if not for a blob of tar bubbling out and onto his eyes blinding him from the headstone that jutted from the earth.

As his body plummeted to cold ground, his body was embraced in eternal darkness as his life was extinguished in a mass of fire and furry piranhas. 

Stepping away from the sight to reunite with Eli, we locked eyes separated only by the gruesome demise of Jimmy to the hands of Regent.

Hands stained black and eyes bulging with hate and maggots, Regent sunk his jagged teeth into the neck of Jimmy ripping at his skin with glutinous savagery. Hands with fingers too long and with too many joins wrapped around his ankles locking him into place. Lustful eyes licked at rotten lips before sliding tongues up at his tattered jeans. In defense of Jimmy, he put up the best fight he could as his cannon arms swung at the entangling bodies wrapping around him.

His fist connected into a pulpy mass of raven black head of hair. The shrieking woman bit down into his groin at the sudden bash she had received. A swarm of flies, sap, and murky moss muffled his scream with a vile kiss. His body slowly buckled under the weight of Regent forcing him on top of the coven that climbed up his legs until his chest burst open with spiders and moths raining onto the blood pooled below.

The others had suffered for less, but I still did not envy the terror that consumed their bodies before the cemetery consumed them.

It had taken the remainder of the night to clear the debris of human remains. The Homecoming dance that year had been canceled and a period of mourning was held for the dangers of underage drunk driving. The importance of abstaining from alcohol until legally eligible and never driving after having any intoxicants had been the recurring mantra for the remainder of that year. Every bar and liquor store in the town checked every ID and designated drivers were on constant call to prevent another tragic loss of life from ever occurring again.

No one in the town asked why Jimmy’s car was parked outside of the cemetery and without a single blemish. The fact was he died in a drunk driving accident that killed him and seven of his closest friends.

The Midnight Run is a tradition as old as the cemetery. Hopefully, with more guards to keep a watch, the risk of getting caught will help deter any more sacrifices.

I doubt that it will.

The cemetery calls to everyone in the town in one way or another.

In my small town, you either die in the cemetery, or you are buried in it.
