It was almost Christmas when I started hearing noises at night... breathing, and a sound like someone was clearing their throat. I thought at first it was hypnagogic hallucinations; hallucinations on the cusp of sleep. It had happened to me before. But then, It started speaking to me. The tone was high, tinny. Inhuman. Please let me out. Please help me. One night (lamp on all night by this point) I jumped fast out of bed and strode to the door and threw it open. There was (of course) nothing there. But I worried how this thing would progress. That maybe I would start to see It. And I couldn't bear the thought of that. I started fighting sleep until daylight. I drank coffee all night, on the couch. I fell asleep upright sometimes, always after the sky was that inky shade of blue that casts at 4 or 5 am. I did this for weeks, and it really seemed to help. But I burnt out on the two to three hours sleep a night and random daytime naps I was getting. I will tell you, with moderate embarrassment; moderate in the hope that you can sympathise, that I lost my job. I was being late too often, and missing days. I went on government assistance, and I struggled to pay that month's rent and eat enough at the same time. All because of a stupid night terror. 





 Now, I had insomnia for real. I stayed awake for two nights, three nights, sometimes four. I got some Xanax for my panic attacks, and I used it at night too, anything to sleep, not even caring about the creature in the closet anymore. Maybe it had gone. I started sleeping whenever I wanted to and could. It was nothing but a blessing and a relief to me. I stayed on the couch, though. It was the night before Christmas Eve when I woke fast from a dream I'd been having. I'd been looking in a mirror, and then there was a banging at the door to the room I was in. I saw my pupils dilate to almost the diameter of my irises, and then suddenly I was staring up at the living room ceiling, and it was dark. I got up slowly, rigidly, reigning in my fear. Three foot from the light switch, I lost nerve and jumped at it, flicking it down. It stayed dark. I was panicking now. I strode to the window. All the streetlights were out. I looked across the road to the block of flats looking onto mine and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Every single light was out. And there wasn't a star to be seen in the sky. 



 A spec of dust slowly floated down on the other side of the window. And then another, and another. Snow ? But it was... sludgy looking. I opened the window up wide, distracted from my terror for the moment. I leant out and looked to my right side. There was a massive, amber moon, low in the sky. The snow was coming down in a flurry now, and it was white, and I felt my heart relax in my chest, still feeling every reverberation under my hand. I walked to the kitchen, tried the light switch in there. It went on, bathing the kitchen and a section of the living room in a warm yellow luminance. I'm safe, I thought. I'm safe. I went slowly back to look out of the window. The streetlights were on. Behind them, the flats across the road were dotted with a yellow square of light. White snowflakes in their thousands whirled down from the sky to the street, evaporating on the black ground. But... the moon was gone. 



 I stared at the black space it had left behind, trying to see the clouds it had to have been behind. That was when I heard the first bang. A cold sweat trickled down the back of my neck, making my t- shirt stick to my skin. There was a few moments of silence, and I wanted, inexplicably, desperately, to laugh, at myself, at his whole weird night. Maybe I was dreaming. I looked at my hand, at the triangle on my palm. There was a thud- thud. It was coming from down the hallway, or from my bedroom. My phone buzzed with a notification. I leapt for it, grabbing it up off of the couch. I didn't care who it was. I needed anyone. On the screen: you should have helped me. My blood turned to ice, and my heart stopped still. I heard it. I had to focus to take my next breath. And I made a decision. There had been nothing last time I looked, and what would I do otherwise ? Stay standing there, terrified, until morning ? The first few steps took a lot, and then I was moving on autopilot, as if in a dream, and then I was opening my bedroom door, flicking the light switch down. It stayed dark. 



The closet door was shut tight. My phone in my hand buzzed again, but I didn't need to look to get the message. Didn't need to put myself through that. It was almost echoing through the air. Let Me Out. I took a quick breath, grabbed the door handle, and yanked it open. And, it was me. Horror washed down my twin's face. The pupils almost spanned the diameter of the irises. And then there was blackness, and screaming, and I realised it was me. It's cold here. It's vast, and dark. I walk. There's not much left to do. Sometimes I hear her talking, laughing. I don't believe she is evil. She's forgotten about this, about me. Or maybe she just thinks it was a dream. It should be. But it isn't, and I'm trapped in this place. I believe what has happened is I've stumbled upon a sort of cave between dimensions. I have no life now, just hers to watch. Sometimes I find gaps, and I can see her in them, with my family, at work, playing with my cat. But it's grey, and muffled. The thing that scares me the most about this place is that I don't know if I will ever die. At least I have my phone...
