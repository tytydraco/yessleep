I don't remember exactly when it was but I know it was a warm night. Me, my sister, my two stepsisters and 2 of their boyfriends including my mom and my stepfather at the time, went camping at this camp site just about 30 minutes from where we lived at. Rumors said it was haunted, I personally liked haunted things. They were interesting but I never poked my nose around to discover things. They just...came to me instead.

Most them didn't believe in "scary" things. That night. I saw something that I know I won't ever forget. 

Stepfather driving the truck down to the campsite, my mom in the passenger side and us teenagers in the bed of the truck listening to music and living life. As soon as we arrived there the air was still and quiet. We didn't know or I should say..they didn't notice. I'm younger than all of them so they thought my mind was playing tricks on me. If so then why do I remember it clear as day? Even after so many years. I said I don't remember when but I know I was 12 to 13 years old. 

It was about 5 to 6 ish. Sun was going down but enough light to see around us. Everyone was setting up camp, tents, fire, smores, you name it. I had a feeling something was off. I KNEW something was off. Every time I got that feeling. Something bad was going to happen. There were bathrooms across from where we had our camp at and our truck was right beside our camp. 

Sun was down. No Moon. No Stars. Just clouds. It never rained. Only a slight breeze passed by me and I could feel it. The trees weren't moving. But there was wind. I could only see with the fire light that the leaves weren't moving and I also had a flashlight but only on my phone. I saw it. Without the flashlight. Without the fire light. A "statute" shadow. Back then I didn't believe in stuff of fictional like vampires gargoyles etc. But that...thing...looked like a gargoyle. My fear rose. I was scared. I use to dream about scary movies and that never scared me because I knew they were dreams but this...this was real..right in front of me.

I started telling anyone that could listen to me or hear. Only my youngest stepsister's boyfriend (again, both are older) noticed and asked where and what. I told him that there was something there. He had a flashlight and he shined it where I pointed. The red-eyed glowing...thing had turned to stone right before my eyes..but...only I could see it...he couldn't see it...I was scared...I yelled and screamed "RIGHT THERE." He never saw it. Only I did. But every time you put light onto it, it would freeze up and turn to stone. But with no light. It was watching you like a hawk in the dark with red eyes watching every move you had made. 

After no one believed me. I told everyone I'm sleeping in the truck and I'm locking the doors. I got into the vehicle and locked the doors. It took me a long time to sleep until I was so tired I passed out. It wasn't until I woke up that it was morning. Everyone was walking around or that I remember..its a bit foggy after that. Except the part where I didn't see the "statue" shadow. There wasn't even anything where that...thing was at. I was a child. I never saw anything like that before. But this...was just the beginning...
