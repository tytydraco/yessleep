I am posting this here to remind everyone that we should not let our curiosity get the best of us. I no longer have the safety and security you guys have in life. You should all be thankful for the people who care about you. 

I was always a joyful person, full of life and energy. Still, I was always fascinated by the supernatural and paranormal world. I was the one who would force friends to watch horror movies or play horror pranks; I believed that I could see demons, ghosts, and spirits. I would always try to find haunted places near our hometown, but I never knew I had something waiting to change my idea of the supernatural world. 

It was a typical night as any other night when I boarded the night bus, the same crowd of people waiting at the bus terminal, crackheads and alcoholics wandering like zombies, people obnoxiously talking loud on their phones, packing and unpacking bags, and children playing around. I was looking forward to going back to my wife. I hang up on her after talking about my trip and giving her all the details about the bus terminal. The bus was a modern double-decker bus with mood lights and the air freshener smell that filled the air. However, the seats were cramped; slowly, the seats started to fill with new passengers, and a heavy man was snacking noisily and sat beside me, which meant no more space to stretch or sleep. Despite the discomfort, I forced myself to settle in for the journey, hoping to get some rest.

The weather suddenly started to get darker and rain. For a long time, I just stared outside and enjoyed the rain hitting the bus window, completely ignoring the big fella munching on his snacks and chewing loudly. But he fell asleep and started snoring, trying to distract myself, I started browsing multiple social media apps on my phone and reading horror stories on /nosleep. After what felt like hours, I fell asleep, exhausted from the previous night.

When I woke up, everything was out of place and surreal. The only lights were the faint glow of the floor lights, the only sound of the bus tires on the street, and all the other passengers were in deep slumber with something covering their faces. I felt a sense of unease, but I tried to shrug it off and checked my phone. The time read early morning, but the sky outside was dark, looking out the window, the bus seemed to be driving through a dense forest.

As time passed, I began to realize that something was off. The bus never stopped, and the other passengers never woke up. The darkness outside seemed to stretch on forever, and no sign of civilization was in sight. The bus ride never seemed to end.

My heart grew heavier and heavier, and I began to wonder if I was stuck in some kind of nightmare. The eerie atmosphere of the bus and the endless darkness got to me, and I struggled to stay calm. I was not trying to be too obvious, but I tried to wake up the other passengers by accidentally nudging them, making loud noises, or playing something loud on my phone. Still, they were unresponsive, I went down but the bus driver simply gave me the same answer he did the last five times "just go back and try to get some sleep".

Hours turned into days, and days turned into weeks, but the bus never stopped. I lost track of time and resigned myself to the fact that I would never escape from the endless darkness.

But then, one day, something strange happened. The other passengers on the bus began to wake up, one by one. They looked around, confused and disoriented as if they had been in a deep sleep for a long time. Looking out the windows, they realized they were in a completely different place. The bus had brought them to an abandoned town overrun with supernatural creatures.

My fascination with the supernatural led me to my ultimate demise. The bus driver turned towards me and spoke in a deep, ominous voice, "Welcome to your new home. You will never leave this place. Your life has led you to your ultimate fate."

The other passengers looked at me with terror as I realized I was trapped in a nightmare that would never end. I struggled to find a way out, but the supernatural creatures that roamed the town were too powerful for him to handle.

Days turned into months, and months turned into years, but I still remain trapped in this abandoned town, haunted by the ghosts of my nightmares and the creatures that lurked in the shadows. I struggle to keep my sanity, but the endless darkness and the sinister presence of the supernatural slowly consume me daily.

Ultimately, this fascination with the paranormal has led me down a path of destruction, and I must pay the ultimate price.
