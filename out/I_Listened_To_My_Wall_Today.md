I know just from the title, you'll think all kinds of stuff. “Nothing he's saying is real!” 
“It's all in his head!”
“He's crazy!”
Et cetera. Et cetera.
I don't care about what anyone thinks anymore. I listened to my wall today, and now I know the truth.

It’s been talking to me for months, but today I finally decided to listen. It started as a whisper one morning when I was getting ready for work. I thought my wife was talking in her sleep. Nope. It was the wall. It wanted me to listen. I didn’t then. I did today. Now I know the truth.

My wife thinks I’m crazy. You probably think I’m crazy too. I don’t care about that anymore, about what anyone thinks. I don’t have to. The wall told me I didn’t have to anymore. Well, sub textually it did. I’m real good at picking up on stuff like that, and with the information that I have now, the opinions of sheep are not worth dedicating time to.

And listen, I know I’m rambling a bit. When I tell you what the wall told me, you’ll understand. Matter of fact, you’ll be thanking me. You’ll be worshipping me as a prophet, a messenger of the good word given unto me by the lord. Maybe I’ll get a seat by his throne when the time comes.

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to sound so narcissistic just now. I have trouble sometimes with my emotions and my ego gets ahead of me sometimes. I’m not even going to take that out of my post. I want you guys to know that I’m just like the average guy. I have my flaws, same as all of you. The only difference is that I have the wall. And it’s MY wall. It talks to ME.

Maybe I shouldn’t even post this. Maybe I should stop typing right now. Average people don’t deserve to know about the wall. And what if I start writing about it and it leaves??? I can’t go on without it now. It was waiting so long for me to listen, and now I have. And it thanks me. It gives me hope. I’m faithful. What will you tell me next, I wonder?

My wife is starting to hate me. The wall told me that. It didn’t ONLY tell me that, but it did tell me that. I know it’s right. I see the disdain in her eyes. The look of love now replaced with the look of anger and fear. Anger I understand. Fear I don’t. She’s not in any danger. The wall told me she was safe.

Lost track of time. Listened to the wall again. The roaring lion. He’s coming to gather the nations. He’s preparing for war. He wants me on the front. He wants me to lead his armies into battle. He wants me to punish those that follow the lamb. I’ve done his bidding once. I’ll do it again. She will thank me later.

I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I saw your cross and knew. It wasn’t my choice. I hope you know that I had to. I never thought I would be blessed with such great purpose. Please forgive me if you see this. If you see me now, kneeling in your blood. Picking your brains out of my beard. Trying to decide if I should readjust your hair that still clings to the remainder of your scalp. Should I make you look pretty? I don’t want someone to see you in this condition. You would be so embarrassed. You were always so easy to embarrass. 
I’m sorry.

What do I do now? The wall isn’t talking anymore. Not even whispers. Not fair. You take away from me and I don’t get any replacement? My emptiness needs to be filled. I opened myself to you. You discard me? What do I do to make you TALK TO ME AGAIN???

Should I share your truth? The truth you shared with me? Should I spread your message? But what if someone else takes the place at your side? It should be ME. You talked to ME. If you wanted the rest of the world to know, you should have told them. They don’t DESERVE to know!! 

I just have to join him. If I’m going to keep helping him, I have to be by his side. Only one way to do that. I never liked pain. It’ll only hurt for a second, right? As long as I don’t miss. 

I’ll see y’all soon.
