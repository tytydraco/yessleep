[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1efd5mv/the_complex_part_two/)

  
Heaven to a sinner is paradise. Hell to a saint is home.



I wake up in an elevator. The tarp lining the walls has begun to fall off, now. The number pad on the right is gone now. Almost like I could previously choose the floor in which I wanted to be trapped, but I no longer have such luxury. I thought to choose a different floor never crossed my mind, but I can't shake the feeling that I miss it now that it's gone. I creaking and squeaking of the elevator climbing its way up is louder and more pronounced than ever before. It's almost like the building is beginning to fall apart. Or, maybe I'm the one who's falling apart. I don't see a meaningful difference between the two. The electronic floor display is completely blank. However, the electronic voice is becoming more clear. 

"Thirtieth floor." The female voice announces, though the word floor was spoken in a noticeably deeper tone, almost like the recording was slowed down in that moment. I step out of the elevator and into the room. It's a hospital setting this time. I don't quite like the potential implications of this. In the main room, there sits a large cornered desk where I assume the nurses would be working. The clock on the wall gives me its usual frozen stare while depicting the time of 12:18. Along the four walls are several small rooms that hold individual beds, but they are all empty with the lights turned off. I spot a calendar on the wall displays the date June 30th, 2024, a day that it is most assuredly not. The picture on the calendar labeled is "The Founders" and shows five people in lab coats whom I recognize from both the painted portraits of the Office, and the photos of the School. I quick turn to my right reveals, yet again, the same closed door that leads to the hallway. The space to my left is now occupied by a vacant patient room. It is neither a blank wall or the Hell Door from the last two dreams. The background noise this time is about what you'd expect from a hospital setting. Phone calls, beeping pagers, both hushed whispers and exasperated loud voices, heartbeat monitors, and the clacking of both dress shoes and the soft patter of slippers on the hard tile floor. 

Despite there being no real fundamental difference in this area's set up than the others, I can't help but feel an air of menace this time around. It's difficult to explain, but as I made my way through the hallway, I had the strangest feeling that the distant shadows were moving around slightly less than usual. In the last two scenarios, they moved with the usual hustle and bustle that you'd expect from office workers and kids at school. This time, though, it feels like they're pausing just a bit longer to... stare at me. I can't say for sure, since they have no faces that I can see, but I can feel their gaze on me. Regardless, I continue on my familiar, yet distinct, journey. I glance out the window yet again. The fog in the tree line now glowed with a sickly yellow with green hues. "How appropriate." I thought to myself. Whether or not its deserved, people tend to associate hospitals with colors that typically represent illness. At least, I was one of those people. The feeling of unease grew further as I noticed that there were now three cars parked in the lot. The same one from last time hadn't moved, but now two more joined it in a random assortment. 

The portraits on the wall were of the same people as before, but now they were in lab coats like they were on the calendar. The hallway this time seemed to stretch much further than I'm usually used to. The further I walk, the more and more the ambience changes. Faint laughter has joined the nightmare chorus as well as whispers of what appears to be doctors or nurses reading off a medical diagnosis. Specifically, my diagnosis. "Patient is male and in his early thirties. Patient is currently experiencing an elevated heart rate, cold sweat, and overwhelming feelings of anxiety. Patient appears to be suffering from a paranoid delusion." Great. Now, these things are mocking me. I close my eyes and continue to attempt to listen to the whispers. I don't like what I hear too much. "Patient is a female in her late twenties. She is currently sleeping. She'll likely be awake soon. Come say hello."

I find it difficult to open my eyes, almost like I'm a child watching a scary movie. Still, I should press on. If nothing else, sitting still feels somehow less productive than walking around in circles. It feels like I've been walking in this hallway for almost thirty minutes, and I don't seem to be getting any closer to the exit. Every window that I pass shows the exact same image, unchanging despite my supposed change in position. I take a quick glance behind me. I'm not sure what propelled me to do it. Maybe the feeling that I was being watched had started getting to me. My instincts must be pretty decent because I was, in fact, being watched. The shadow people were now at the end of the hallway I just came from, but they weren't moving anymore. They just stood there, watching me. I froze for what seemed like minutes in my head. A cold sweat started breaking out on my neck, and my breathing became heavy. I quickly turn back around to find that I was standing in front of the door at the end of the hallway. This wasn't here a second ago. Gripping the handle with my clammy hands, I open the door and step through. It was exactly what I expected. I was once again standing in the same room as I started in. Almost.

I quickly look at the clock to see what I already knew. Clasped within its frozen hands was the time 1:29. I make my way around the room in order to inspect the environment to see if I could spot any differences. I spot one pretty quickly. The calendar, which previously showed the same five people as the other portraits, now only had four people in the picture. Of the three men and two women, one of the women was missing. My head starts to ache and my vision gets blurry for a second. I'm not sure if this is what having your mind blown feels like, but I'm positive that I'm developing a migraine from the sheer stress I feel. I close my eyes and steady my breathing, and it's then that I notice another difference from the previous loop. It is now completely silent. No phones, no footsteps, and no whispers. Remembering how my previous dream ended, I nervously swallow what little moisture there was left in my nervous, dry throat. I look to my left and see it again. The door that shouldn't be. I hear no noise coming from it this time, but the message is clear. Adorned on the door is a fogged glass window with fading gold lettering painted on it. "Room 30" it says. I'm not sure what compelled me to open the door, but the urge I felt was strong. I wrap my shaking fingers around the handle expecting to feel the cold steel back against my skin. Instead, the handle was warm like someone else had just used it. My breathing grows frantic and I can hear my heart beat in my ears. My shaking causing the handle to rattle, I begin to slowly open the door when I hear something that caused me to stop. On the far side of the room, the elevator dings, and the robotic female voice can be heard saying, "Thirtieth floor." 

I'll pick this story up back in part four. It's going to be a long one.
