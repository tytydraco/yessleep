“Worms?!”

Admittedly, my voice was loud. I didn’t realize how loud it was until the nurse who had been pottering around the room, danced towards the door with a strained smile and shut it quickly. Dr. Marriot wore a professional demeanour though I could tell even he was confused—and maybe a little disgusted. 

He didn’t look much older than me, which made me want to crawl into a hole. I had been sitting on the uncomfortable crinkling paper for a grand total of almost ten minutes while the campus doctor squinted at his computer and made several acknowledging noises. 

When I had leaned forward to see what he was looking at, I realized he was scrolling through Google. He looked like a junior doctor, sure, but searching through Google right in front of a patient was the epitome of unprofessional. 

I wanted to know what was wrong with me and clearly, he didn’t have the proper answers. 

The doctor was just guessing, and that prospect made my stomach turn. It didn’t make sense to me that the reason why I had been blacking out for the last several weeks, as well as having an addiction to eating my roommate’s raw bacon during said fugue state, was that I had worms. Wasn’t that what dogs had? I didn’t go near dogs because they weren’t allowed on campus. The only animal in my vicinity was my roommate’s hamster she had somehow managed to hide from security. 

“It’s a parasite.” The doctor corrected, leaning back on his chair with what I hoped was a reassuring smile. “Have you been swimming in a river lately?” He inclined his head, “Or maybe been near a wild animal? I’ve had quite a few students with the same symptoms, so I am curious if all of you have been to the same swimming hole during recreational activity."

“Swimming hole?”

He nodded. “Yes. Your symptoms match with several of my other patients I’ve seen over the last few days.”

That intrigued me. “Who were they?" 

“That is classified information, Ruby.” He said. “However, I will say all of your cases point to a simple matter of being in and perhaps ingesting the wrong water. Giardiasis is a common parasite which can be found in swimming pools, spa’s, and large bodies of water, such as lakes or rivers. There are of course more waterborne parasites, but this one seems the most likely.”

That made sense, I guessed. It was spring break, and the only large body of water near our campus was a polluted river.

It wasn’t out of the realm of possibility that a group of students had all contracted some kind of disease from the filthy water.

Which made me wonder why they weren’t being quarantined or questioned in case of transmission to other students. I had seen enough disease blockbusters to be paranoid. Still though, it was a known infection which had antibiotics. I should have just nodded my head and lied, and said, “Oh yeah, maybe I was in that lake with the others.”  But that wasn’t me. 

I barely left my dorm-room. After my blackouts started, I had pretty much resigned myself to staying in my room. When I shook my head, his expression sort of creased in confusion. 

These were the kind of looks I didn’t want. I didn’t want confusion and nervousness from someone in the medical field who had just announced that I had a living thing wriggling around in my gut. If I was going to believe it was a parasite, it did make sense that it was giving me these insane cravings. But there was no way to explain the blackouts without turning it into a potential idea for a movie. 

I was caught up in my own thoughts trying to figure out if it was possible for a threadworm or a whatever-worm to creep its way to my brain and take over my mind when the doctor turned back to his computer and started to type vigorously. “Vacations? Have you recently been anywhere tropical? It is common to pick up parasites from either swimming or drinking in the water,” he explained. “They are usually harmless, though they can become disruptive as they grow in size—which looks to be your case. They can also cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and gas.” 

Again, he was reading straight off of Google—no, I peered closer. The CDC website. 

Which was possibly the worst page he could have brought up.  I guess that’s when he made his diagnosis, despite knowing full well I had not experienced any gut problems except a sudden appetite for raw meat. The doctor didn’t wait for me to tell him I had in fact not gone on vacation, or swimming. With the way he was hurriedly typing up my diagnoses and prescribing pills for me to take, I think he was eager to get me the hell out of there. 

It’s not like I could blame him. His facial expression when I was describing my late-night binge on raw poultry was very telling. Still though, I took my prescription with my best smile, and headed back into the waiting room while it was processed.

I was hungry again. Luckily, I’d packed salted peanuts before leaving for classes. What I really wanted was something meaty, a hamburger, or maybe chilli. But that probably wasn’t a good idea. If there was in fact a parasite leeching off of everything I ate and demanding more, I didn’t want to satisfy it further. According to the prescription I had stuffed in my pocket, I was suffering from a parasitic infection in my lower intestine. I had googled parasites before going to the doctor because that was my initial thought. But craving wise, I was supposed to want sugar, not my roommate’s left over raw steaks which were yet to make me sick. I had consumed a multitude of raw meat over the last several weeks, and somehow I wasn’t bent over my toilet projectiling from both ends.

I wasn’t even eating it consciously, and that is what I tried to explain to the doctor—but he had dismissed it as a delusion from lack of sleep. But I knew I wasn’t delusional and was sleeping. I was just sleeping at inappropriate times like a fucking vampire, passing out in classes and at home, and then waking up somewhere else entirely. The campus library was a particular favorite of my subconscious self. I had woken up three times in the last two weeks, comfortably slumped in a chair with my head in my arms. And that is where I had found it. 

Lodged between two copies of Frankenstein, one of which crumbling apart while the other was a brand new edition, was a bound leather journal. 

The book didn’t look too old. When I opened it up, I found myself staring at the owner of the journal’s name written in flowery handwriting.  

Wendy Ever. 

The name twisted my stomach, but even half-asleep, I still felt prickles of panic creeping its way up my spine. It didn’t make sense for me to be holding her journal because Wendy was one of five missing students who had disappeared the year before. 

The thought still gave me chills. Five normal sophomores, none of which were linked, or friends. They were in the same class but that was it. All five of them were gone—and there was no explanation or leads. Nothing. 

The only thing which did transpire was their professor, Evangeline Hook, had been arrested and then released the same day before quitting a week later. 

I remember the investigation, sniffer dogs being brought around campus  and multiple statements from the mayor insisting that these five students were going to be found. Though it wasn’t long before the investigation began to dry up, and slowly, very slowly, they were forgotten, becoming another cold-case, which I heard was a Netflix documentary before being shut down by their grieving parents. 

My point is, Wendy Ever was dead. It had been a year, and the overall consensus on campus was that Professor Evangeline Hook had killed them, and somehow gotten away with it with her connections. I don’t think anyone wanted to question it. Because what are you supposed to say to a case with zero leads? 

There was nothing. These kids had existed one minute and were gone the next.

It didn’t make sense how they could just drop off of the face of the earth.

And yet somehow I was holding that supposed dead girl’s journal. 

My first thought was to turn it into the cops, and I was meaning to. I was just.. putting it off. Wendy’s diary was still in my bag when I was in the doctor’s office, and I was yet to open it. I had a suspicion there would be nothing which would open a new investigation. Apparently, Wendy was a daydreamer, so I expected short stories, poems, and doodles, maybe whimsical love confessions to an oblivious stranger. 

The doctor’s office was thankfully mostly empty, and my hands were itching to delve inside my backpack and pull out the journal, but every time I plucked up the courage to stuff my hands in my bag, a rattling sound almost sent me flying out of my chair. Until then, a guy had been sitting opposite me nodding his head to music corked in his ears, a small daydreamy smile on his face, his head tipped back, gaze scoping the ceiling. It was his hair which had attracted my attention initially; a crow’s nest of reddish curls sticking from under a hoodie he kept pulling over his head. The guy looked older than me, maybe a junior. I didn’t pay full attention to him until the rattling sound, which was a small bag in his lap. I thought it was weed at first, before I caught the aroma. 

Beef jerky.

That’s what it smelled like, anyway. 

The aroma was sweet and a little salty, and it was driving me crazy. I hadn’t eaten since downing cup ramen the night before. 

This kid looked… high. Whatever plane of existence he was on, happily chewing mindlessly on beef jerky, I was jealous. 

His eyes scared me a little. Whatever drug this guy was on, I was sure it was seriously fucking with his head. He dragged his eyes over to me, and seemed to drink me in, tilting his head as if I was an enigma he couldn’t understand. The guy didn’t smile, continuing to chew slowly like it was gum. There was a certain blankness in his expression which sent shivers up my spine. It reminded me of how my roommate had described me during my blackouts. 

“There’s nobody at home.” Elena had told me with a crinkle of worry in her eyes. And that is exactly what I saw on this boy’s  face. With him, I don’t think anyone was ever at home. When the corners of the guy’s lips quirked into a smile, something warm crept its way up my throat. I watched him stuff his fingers in the bag, pull out strips of jerky and stuff it into his mouth like an animal. Again and again, he didn’t stop until the bag was half empty, and his fingers were smeared red and wet with grease.  And to my horror, my stomach started to gurgle, the stink of the jerky tingling in the back of my nose and throat. 

I was hungry, and the urge to lean forward and snatch the bag out of his hands was suddenly overwhelming. It’s not like he would react, I thought dizzily. Before quickly getting hold of myself. Instead of reveling in the idea of stuffing my face with dried meat, I reached into my bag, pulled out the peanuts I’d packed for this exact kind of situation, and downed a fistful, almost choking on the salt.

But that didn’t stop the guy’s challenging eyes when he lifted the bag and waved it in the air back and forth like he was teasing me.  I noticed it was wetter than I thought, and the consistency of the scarlet smeared on the inside of the baggie shouldn’t have matched dried meat. Maybe he’d seasoned it with something. That was the most likely explanation. But then I was glimpsing the spatters of red on his lips and chin he wasn’t bothering to swipe away—and the knot in my gut began to tighten.

“Mrs Leywood?”

The doctor’s voice was a welcome distraction, and I jumped up and grabbed my bag, grateful to get away from the beef jerky guy. Who thankfully snapped out of it too. In fact, he seemed as mortified as me, turning away and cranking up his music.

“Take two every day with water and after eating,” The doctor said, handing me the medication. “If there are any more problems, don’t hesitate to come back, okay?”

His expression, however, told me to see a therapist immediately, or maybe sign myself into the psych ward.

I nodded, and quickly got out of there, not before hearing him call out, “Levi? Come on in.”

No last name?

Maybe he was a returning patient.

I was out of the door and throwing myself down the stairs, eager to get away from the stink of beef jerky—or whatever the guy had been eating. I usually headed to the library during my free-time, so I made myself comfortable on one of the beanbags in the social section, pulled out Wendy Ever’s diary, as well as a triple espresso coffee to keep me awake, and began to read.

Opening it up, at first glance the journal looked empty, before I spied the last page.

FOUND YOU.

The chilling words scrawled on the very last page were barely comprehensible and I don’t even think they were written in pen.

That was it?

Flicking through the book, it looked like that was the only page filled. Which made me wonder if what I had found wasn’t a dead girl’s journal, and more likely someone’s idea of a sick joke. Leaning back in my chair, I sipped my coffee. 

I don’t know why I went back to check. Maybe I wanted to see if there was a meaning to the last page’s message, or I was looking for a fake account of this dead girl written by someone who thought they had a sense of humor. 

But when I flicked back through the journal, pages and pages of writing began to appear right in front of my eyes. I noticed the handwriting started neat and fancy, before twisting and writhing into something more of a childish scrawl before she had abandoned the pen all together and instead used something else which stained each corner a revealing shade which I wasn’t going to register. 

I knew what it was—and when I remembered that this girl was presumed dead, and I had found her bloodstained journal, the pieces I didn’t want to think about were starting to come together in my head. But first I would read whatever had happened before her last moments. 

Maybe it might be enough to charge the professor. With that in my mind, I tried to find a specific entry with names I could pick out, but I was just reading scribbles. 

In my hands, the journal changed weight several times, becoming thicker and grittier, before losing its density all together.

I thought I was hallucinating. Flicking back and forth, the journal was full. When I went to the beginning, I found myself staring at multiple pages of a single entry. Once my eyes had fixated on the text, however, the rest of the journal turned blank. I checked three times, but what I was seeing was real. This journal seemed to want me to read certain entries whether they were in order or not. So, bracing myself, I began to read entry one.

… 

06/12/2022.

Surviving members: 5 (and a half)

I think that’s the date, anyway. I’ve been tallying each day I think has been going by. 

Though I could be wrong. I don’t think date exists here—or time. Things seem to not exist and then suddenly exist. Does that make sense? I think that is what happened to us. I remember not knowing my name, or who I was. Why we are here. And then I did! I don’t know how or why, but I have good enough memories right now, and Tink managed to make a fire, so I have light. First of all, congratulations! I don’t know how you could have found this because I’m pretty sure we are in a space which shouldn’t exist. But I’m probably dead right now. I either starved to death, or this place made me end it by my own hand. 

I will start by telling you a cool fact about where we are. Whatever we try and change automatically switches back to the way it was. So, if I was to open a door and walk through it, in less than five seconds I would be in the exact same spot and that door would be closed. 

The only things which do change are us, and whatever this space wants to change. According to my tally’s at the front of this book, it’s our third day here and our bodies are seemingly the same. It started off weird. A phenomenon I don’t think has finished with us yet. It made us forget our names and why we were here, over and over again, losing each other and finding each other inside these endless twisting walls and doors of swirling nothing. I didn't think nothing could have a smell, but it does. It smells like shoes polish. This place is like a fun mirror. I found my old self, my younger self, my dying self, a version of me which was twisted and turned inside out with my guts spilling out. 

I even saw the version of myself which wasn't thrown inside this hell. On the next floor, I came face-to face with my parents and my friends. I even stepped through an elevator which led into a parallel dimension where chickens killed humans for meat. I had a nightmare about that as a kid, so I think that is what this thing—this space—is. It plays with our thoughts, reaching into the backs of our minds and finds our deepest, darkest nightmares, bringing them to startling clarity in front of us. I barely even knew my  name, and my entire life, an identity I vaguely knew was being twisted and contorted on hallways made of mirrors and backwards doors, spiralling staircases leading to swimming pools filled with glass. 

I can’t tell you how many times I ran into Peter or Tink, both of whom had the exact same haunted facial expression lacking recognition before I had an idea. I knew my name was Wendy, at least some of me did. So, to staple our existence, I wrote down our names, or what we thought our names were. Which worked! But I am scared that our identity only exists on that page. What if we tear it by accident, or spill something on it? I will make sure that does not happen. I will protect our names with my life. When we fully came to, and our memories started to come back to us, the first thing we tried to do as a group was escape. But there is no escape. 

You will see me write a lot of but’s.

We are alive, BUT there is no exit. We remember our names, BUT they only exist on a sheet of paper. What scares me is if there's a future when I suddenly don’t want to know the others, and I rip up their names intentionally, or they do it before me. I am sure that will not happen. We are not close by all means, but we share a mutual goal. Getting out of here.  I don’t know how this world works, but I’m sure matter is the same.  We still eat, sleep, and go to the bathroom. And it lets us. 

So, I don’t think this place wants us to die… yet. If I could describe this place, I would call it… a hole, which contorts into a hallway, and that hallway never ends. 

It has doors and some of them open, while some of them don’t—and now I’m not going crazy yet, but I think the sole purpose of this world and why we are inside it is in fact to turn us crazy. 

Exits exist, and that is the most painful thing about this world. There is a way out. But when we inch towards it, a glowing white door gets bigger and bigger, it shrinks to a pinprick, and then nothing. That is enough to turn anyone psycho.  The Isla problem is… not getting better. 

Peter told me to dump her, but I’m not going to. I’ve come to realise Isla and I are a team. Kind of. I’m not letting her go, even if she is sort of a nuisance. She screams a lot. Isla doesn’t remember her name, she doesn’t know my name, or the others. She just says these same words over and over again and I swear to god, journal, sometimes I want to finish her off. I want to end her pain. But I can’t. 

Not when we have survived this far, and we’re here. Inside this hell, we are actually here. 

And whether this place wants us to lose our fucking minds or not, then so be it. Anyway, sorry. This book is my only way to entertain myself.  I want to talk about the others so I don’t seem like I am making this all about me, but there’s not much to say. Isla is… Isla. I think she’s sleeping right now, but it’s hard to tell. Peter is telling what he thinks is a ghost story, and Tink is toasting our last remnants of pop-tart over a fire which could disappear at any moment, if that’s what this space wants. This place doesn’t have a temperature, but when it wants us to be cold, we have to wrap up, and it when it wants us to be warm, and then hot, and then so hot we are crying, screaming and begging—it throws water on us.

I don’t think it wants to kill us… yet. 

Even with the giant elephant in the room. None of us have changed… yet. None of us have become like Isla, but we have all agreed at the first sign of us starting to show her symptoms, and that thing appearing, we are going to kill each other. I don’t mean Hunger Games style. I’m talking about, like… I don’t know. Blunt force trauma to the head? I can think of several objects we can use without making a mess.

But in the back of my mind, I wonder… if matter can be changed and altered inside here, can the same thing happen to us?

Can we be brought back?

Can we be twisted and contorted until we are barely recognisable… like Isla?

So, I bet you’re thinking. How did we get here?

Initially, I wasn’t supposed to be with them. Peter, Tink, Isla, and the others. I was supposed to turn in an essay to our professor. Now, I know we live in the 21st century and have access to such things as laptops and computers and the internet, as well as email. That also exists, right? So, I could have easily turned my essay in online, like every other student on campus. 

However. Professor Hook liked to be different. She told stories in her classes about her time as an archaeologist and allowed emotional support dogs to be brought in before exams. But she also had a strange obsession with physical copies. If you handed in an essay via email, it had to be given to her physically too.

That day, I didn’t go to classes due to cramps, but I knew if my essay wasn’t on her desk in a physical form by 5pm, I was failing the semester. So, with cramps bad enough to cripple my walk, I dragged myself to the main campus. It was a stuffy afternoon, and sitting on a bus which was going to stop every few minutes with a jerking motion enough to send my stomach hurting into my throat, I opted to walk. 

Luckily, the doors were still open. Making my way to the top floor where my usual classes were, I was halfway up the stairs before something, or more likely someone, flew past me in a rush. I could barely even make out a figure. I thought the person was laughing from the way they were panting, gasping for breath.

Though when they stumbled to an abrupt stop, before running back up the stairs, I realized they—she—was crying. Isla… I have forgotten her last name. She was the trust fund kid in our classes, and every time she went skiing with her family, she made sure everyone knew. 

Not exactly a mean girl, but the closest we had to one. Judgmental, and a little snobbish. Also, painfully British. Her dark hair usually twisted into its usual braid had been tugged out, her eyes wide, almost unseeing. I looked behind her to see what she was running from, but there was nothing there. Which made her twisting expression more terrifying. Before I could formulate speech, Isla was wrapping her hand around my elbow and dragging me down the stairs in a stumbled run back down the stairs, before pulling me into the girl’s bathroom.

“What’s going on?” I said, when the girl pulled me into a stall. Isla didn’t waste time pulling me onto the toilet seat and shoving me against the wall, slamming her hand over my mouth when I managed a startled cry. Instead of answering, Isla shook her head and gestured to the door. 

I didn’t understand what she was trying to signal, before the bathroom door outside flew open, and the girl pressed her face into my shoulder. Isla was hot. I could feel the sweat dripping from her. The girl’s body was trembling against mine, and I could just about hear the squeaks she was trying and failing to muffle with her hand.  Click-clack. The sudden sound of heels against marble sent my body into fight or flight. They were slow, almost deliberately slow as they paced up and down the stalls, kicking each one open. Isla reacted to each one, jolting against me, her arms wrapping around my neck. When the click-clacking reached our stall, I braced myself against the wall, before they stepped back, before striding over to the door, yanking it open, and leaving. 

Isla didn’t move until the sound of the professor’s heels echoed back down the hallway. I finally allowed myself to breathe. When I fully took in my classmate, my gaze found a smear of blood on her arm. 

She immediately went to cover it.  

“What the fuck,” I managed to get out, “What the fuck was that?”

Isla jumped off of the toilet seat, heaving out a breath, before peeking out of the stall. No sign of the teacher. Without a word, the girl ran her arm under the faucet before grabbing toilet paper and wrapping it around what I guessed was a scratch. 

Her gaze found mine, and for the first time I think it clocked in her head who I was. 

“Stand against the door.” She whispered, and after hesitating for a moment, I did. “Do you have your phone?” In the several minutes I had been with Isla, I noticed her speech was beginning to slur, or at least slow down. It could have been trauma, but the way she kept nervously glancing at her arm made me wonder if it was in fact something else. With my back against the door, I forced as much weight as I could against it. I didn’t have my phone. I wasn’t expecting to need it on what I thought would be a ten minute trip to our campus.

“No.” I managed to get out.

Isla looked at me like I’d lost my mind. 

“No?” She shrieked. In three strides, she was grabbing the collar of my shirt and shoving me against the wall. She leaned close, and there was something wrong in her eyes. Something which shouldn’t have been there, a vacancy slowly spreading and contorting her expression. The girl must have realized what she was doing before letting me go. She shook her head and blinked rapidly, a moan slipping from her lips.

“Professor Hook just killed my boyfriend,” she whimpered. And when I opened my mouth to speak, she shushed me. “There was a…a  group of us who wanted to see her latest find from her last trip. I didn’t care, I just wanted to get home, but Tink,” she let out a hollow laugh. 

“Fucking Tink. He insisted on us staying longer so we could see… rocks? I didn’t care, but my boyfriend was like, super into all of this weird shit,” Isla’s voice was growing progressively more hysterical. “Anyway.” She gripped my arm tighter, and I had to bite back a squeak. “Professor Hook wanted us to have these tetanus shots as a precautionary measure. I said screw it, and held out my arm, but then Tink just… he just collapsed. And then Peter. Everyone started to drop, like completely out of it, and the crazy bitch grabbed me—"

“What?” 

Isla looked at me, and her lips broke out into a sickly grin. “Yeah, now that I think about it, that probably wasn’t a… you know, a tetanus shot.” She reached out her arm. “It… stings,” her voice cracked. “I don’t want to look at it, can you do it for me?”

I nodded, slowly unwrapping the toilet paper bandage. There was nothing there. “There’s nothing…” when I lifted my gaze to tell Isla, the words stuck in my throat. There was a void like black which had started to swallow up her face, spreading like a virus down her neck. “What’s wrong?” Her voice was still hers, but something was slowly eating away at her, ripping away flesh. 

“Is it… is it bad?” 

Bad? This thing was devouring her. 

Instead of speaking, I took a step back. And so did she. Whatever this thing was, it worked fast. “I don’t… I don’t know where I am,” Isla whispered. “Can you… help me?” she started towards me and threw her arms out blindly. Something dripped from her head, beads of red as this thing began to slice through her skull. Her eyes couldn’t find me, the eyes of a dead person who was still alive, still breathing, and yet had no body and mind to breathe with.

“I don’t know… who….I am,” Isla whispered. “It’s… eating…me.”

When a chunk of her skull hit the floor, and she kept stumbling towards me, I wanted to run. But Isla was whimpering like a wounded animal. I don’t know what part of me it was which bit back the screech clawing at my throat. But my fingers were there, real, and grasping into Isla’s arm— or what was left of it. The darkness was spreading, but I clung on. I just needed to get off campus and find the cops—- or an emergency room. But as I ran, too afraid to look back—- several things hit my mind at once. What if this thing was infectious? 

Was I already infected?  But also… something warm crept up my throat as my footsteps pounded, and so did hers— wet slapping sounds hitting the ground. Isla was being eaten by this thing, she barely knew who she was.  But… she could run. 

Faster than me. 

She could grasp onto my hand, her fingers tangling with mine. I had a momentary thought of dead chickens. When they are beheaded, they can continue running around for up to several hours before finally dropping dead. 

At the corner of my eye, that endless darkness consuming my classmate was growing thicker. Is that what this was? This thing which had turned her inhuman, into a growing, bulbous fleshy thing… was this its torture?

Like mould, it clung to her, eating away at everything she was, body and mind, and yet allowing her to keep…

Feeling.

I could feel it creeping towards my fingers. It didn’t have a consistency or a feeling—- or a temperature.

But it did dizzy my thoughts, causing the world to jar around me. I felt it like an invisible presence settling into my gut.

Coming to a stop, I had a sudden realisation.

Where was the exit again?

Shaking my head, I couldn’t breathe. I had been going to this college for two years, and I couldn’t remember where the exit was? Focus. But I couldn’t. My brain was swimming. I was trying to remember what the exit doors looked like when footsteps startled me. They were quick, heels clacking against the floor. 

Isla moaned, pulling back. Turning back to her, I found myself face to face with a thing bleeding in and out of reality, which had begun to attach itself to my wrist, already filling my veins.

Isla’s face was… gone. Her body, gone, eaten away. All which remained was this shrivelling pool of darkness with her voice, which kept asking what its name was.

“Wendy.”

Professor Hook’s voice was both a reassurance as well as the spindly legs of a spider creeping up my spine.

The woman was standing behind me, her expression frenzied. Her eyes found the darkness growing in the veins of my wrist, and she hissed out. “Fuck.” In her hands was a gun. But it didn’t look like any I’d ever seen. She pointed the gun directly at my head before gesturing us over to her. “Move. Come on. You too, Isla.” My body responded to her order, and I steps towards her, pulling Isla with me. I still wasn’t sure how Isla was still alive, and somehow taking in my and our professor’s words, but she made her way forwards too, what was left of her hands clinging onto me. “It’s eating me,” she said in a soft moan.

The professor gestured down the hallway, pointing the gun at my head again.

“I said move.”

I don’t know how I managed to make my mouth work, knowing whatever was eating its way through Isla, was now inside me. I felt it like a leech beginning to creep into my being, tangling itself with me. “What is this?” I whispered. “What did you do?”

“That has nothing to do with you.”

“But, Isla—-“ I flinched when she pointed the barrel at my face, her finger teasing the trigger. “Isla was a willing volunteer.” The professor said stiffly. “All of my  failing students become willing volunteers whether they like it or not. I’m not sure you understand. This college is part of an… agreement. To use certain students we don’t see fit in their classes, as either human Petri dishes, or a… let’s call it a donation.”

When she led us into the lecture hall, I found myself staring at swirling black which was eating its way through the front of the room. I saw several slumped figures, classmates I knew with their heads tipped back, completely out of it. Professor Hook, still pointing her gun at us, picked up a motionless ----- (Peter Atlas), throwing him over her shoulder, and then into the pooling black. I don’t know what I expected, but the boy’s body being ripped limb from limb wasn’t it. There was no blood, only his being coming apart, slowly, like the darkness creeping into him was taking its time.

He had a name before he was thrown in. I knew it. But before I could register the purge inside my mind, it was gone.

It’s not like we enjoy doing this,” Professor Hook spoke in a scoff, before ducking and grasping hold of -----  (Samuel Tink) and  throwing him into a hurricane of twisting nothing. “It is for the hood of the college, and our research into infectious diseases we find inside the Blob.” She gestured to the thing. “We call it the spot. First noticed by a five year old girl complaining of headaches and speaking of a “blob” at the corner of her eye, it started to spread.” 

Isla, who was more me than her, started to pull me back in a frenzy, but I was… I guess I was hypnotised, transfixed, by the thing in front of me which was eating my classmates, ripping them into pieces. “And on occasion…” Professor Hook added, “It spits things out. It spits out materials and things we cannot and will never understand: creatures, humans, who have fallen through that hole which is rapidly growing between our world and it. And sometimes…” She cleared her throat. 

“Those creatures can be infected by a pathogen we do not have the means or technology to understand—- and believe me, we have tried.” Her expression crumpled. “I am not going to sugar coat this. The less we give it, the more it spits out—and of course we need to feed it to satisfy its hunger.”

I knew where this was going.

“Our failing students…” Our professor continued, walking smoothly towards Isla and I, her click-clacking heels sending the two of us stumbling back.

“No.” I said, echoed by Isla.

“They are a… bittersweet sacrifice. Thankfully, whoever or whatever we give to it, their existences are completely erased. I have… files and files of faces and names which become nothing but strangers without an identity.” She smiled. “It is a cruel fate. But… it is either we keep feeding it, or this thing spreads further, and consumes all of us. And of course, we are abolishing this disease with them. Killing two birds with one stone." She nodded at me. “Tell me. What would our world do if this thing attached to the two of you  spread across continents?”

“But… “ I couldn’t breathe properly. This thing was dizzying my thoughts, making me feel numb. Crazy. “I’m not one of them!”

They were selfish words, and I wish I could have taken them back. But also. I wish I was louder.

“You weren’t one of them.” Professor Hook said. I hated her use of past tense. But then her eyes found the mess which was my flesh entangled with Isla’s. “It doesn’t hurt.” She smiled, which I knew was a lie. Her gun pinpointed between my eyes. “I will give you a choice, which you deserve. I either shoot you, which will be quick and painless—- or you give yourselves to it.”

Shoot me.

The words were on my lips, but Isla was dragging me towards the void-like thing, stumbling over herself, like she was attached to it—- like she could sense it, and the thing was pulling her home. 

I couldn’t stop her. Even when I dug my feet into the ground, she dragged me further, until it was taking my breath, and then my movement. I don’t remember dropping to my knees, only the vague notion of our professor’s hands shoving us forwards.  It took my mind first, ripping it to pieces. I am not sure how to grasp or even describe the concept of losing yourself while also remaining conscious.  Before it took that too.  First, I forgot my name. 

Then, that I even existed. I wonder if this was what being born felt like, not yet self-aware, but alive.   If I could describe it in a way which could be put into words, I would say… being back inside my mother’s womb. There was no time to feel pain, to feel anything. It was just me, Isla, and a startling dark enveloping our entangled bodies and minds——

… 

*“Ruby?”*

The voice cut into my mind like a knife, and I looked up from the journal, my head spinning. The first thing I noticed was that it was dark outside—- and the backs of my hands were…. itching. There were several questions in my mind as I blinked myself back into my own reality. Wendy and the others were missing, I thought dizzily. Professor Hook told her that anything thrown into that.. that thing… was erased from existence. So, how could we remember it? How could our world still remember them? More so, Isla was never included in those names. There was no Isla. 

“You’re Ruby, right?”

The question was like ocean waves, and for a moment I found myself asking myself those exact words.

*I was… Ruby.*

There was a guy looming over me— and when I found his face, I realised it was the guy from the emergency room. Beef Jerky guy. The dim light of the lamp illuminated half of his face, a lopsided smile. At least he looked with-it this time. “Are you okay?”

“Yes.” I lied, scratching at my hand again. It took me a few disorienting seconds to realize my skin was wet, something warm trickling down my bunched fingers. 

Not just that.

My lips tasted like rusty coins, my tongue felt rough and my teeth… filthy. Another look at my hand confirmed that I had been biting into my own skin. Tugging my sleeve over the back of my hand, hiding the smear of red, I struggled to gulp in the air.

Jerky guy—or Levi—didn’t comment on my hand. Instead, his gaze flicked to the journal.

“What’s that?” His lip curved. “Looks ancient.”

It… did?

But I had been sure. I remembered opening it up and smelling the aroma of fresh-book smell. It had been at least a couple of months old! Turning back to the book, he was right. It looked older, battered, like it had been through a storm. The pages were curled and stained, and towards the end, paper became a much thicker material with an almost slimy consistency. It definitely wasn’t paper, or anything which should be written on. Levi stepped back. “Yeah, that shit looks cursed,” he murmured. “I’m going to, uh, head off, kay?"

The guy walked away, not before stopping and pretending to look for a book. I caught him eyeing me nervously, before he kept walking, pushing through old wooden doors. The smell of beef jerky filled the air, and my stomach gurgled. When I was sure he was gone, I turned my attention back to the book, my heart leaping into my throat. 

But when I opened the journal, the writing on the pages I had been reading was gone, and every following page was tally’s.

Endless pages of tally’s marking out days, weeks, months—a year.

I closed the book and then opened it, but there were just tally’s, and following that the same word written on pages thickened like I was dragging my fingers across dried flesh. 

There were no entries. Everything I had read was gone, replaced by tally’s.

The next pages, however, did have words.

*It’s eating me.*

*It’s eating me.*

*It’s eating me.*

I flicked five pages ahead.

*I am eating it.*

My stomach rumbled, my mouth watering suddenly. Swallowing cold coffee souring the back of my throat, I skipped 20 pages, then 50, until paper became something else entirely, attached to the book with some kind of string or thread entangled.

*HUNGRY.*

*HUNGRY.*

*HUNGRY.*

The pages towards the end were more like strips of flesh shoved into the back to make more and more pages, and my gaze went back to my hand I’d been chewing on. I could make out my own teeth marks digging further into my flesh, drawing blood. God, I was hungry. 

I was so hungry. 

Before the last page jumped out at me, two words phantom in my own throat. 

FOUND YOU.
