 Ok, so it's been a while since this happened so I can't really remember clearly every detail.

However, this is the story. On 30th August 2022 (I know the date from the photo's details in my phone), I took a night walk with my friend and his dog.

Now we live in the suburbs, so our neighborhood ends up in a field which is pitch dark at night. So after walking for an hour or so, we could see a couple lights coming from a few deposits on the side of the highway which was crossing the field.

It was around 1:00 AM so my girlfriend got a little worried and asked me if I was good. My dumbass decided to take a photo instead of replying like a normal person. So I ended up sending her the most terrifying photo she's ever seen, without noticing "the thing" I have accidentally caught on camera.

I have no idea what that is, neither does my girlfriend or my buddy. All we know is that it appeared in the photo and we've never seen it again.

I am not able to post it here, but I'll leave an Imgur link for those who want to see it:

Alright so first off I wanna say I never saw that thing with my own eyes. I've only seen it in that photo and never again. My friend was not facing that direction when I took the photo so he had no idea what I was talking about.

I have studied the photo for a while but I cant figure out what that is. My buddy is convinced we saw a homeless guy that probably wore a hoodie. Who knows? Maybe.

However, the fact that nobody noticed him before or after the photo was taken is weird. I mean the path clearly passed that thing's location by a couple meters. It was impossible to not notice it.

There was nothing else there. Coming back the next day, I didn't see anything in that exact same place.

Also the dog didn't freak out or anything. He usually barks at strangers and always knows when somebody is nearby even if we don't see them. But as far as I remember, the dog clearly didn't notice it either.

However, things started to get interesting a couple weeks ago, when somebody reported finding a dead body on that field. The location was about 50-60 meters away from where my photo was taken. 

Following the news, it seems like the dead body was burnt. However the police and investigators could not identify the person (due to the damage, it was unrecognizable) and neither could they determine when and who killed them. Although the body didn't look old, they said it must've been a couple of days the most.

Also it seems that the body appeared out of nowhere because none of the nearby CCTV's caught anybody dumping anything there, in the middle of nowhere. Absolutely nobody knows how it got there.

Recently all the paths leading to the field are closed and guarded by the police. 

So yeah, me and my friend will consider finding another walking route...
