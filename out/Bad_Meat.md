By all accounts, I’ve had a fairly normal life. A circus of random chance, cataclysm and fortune entering and leaving like a pair of messy lovers. When I am gone, I will leave no lasting impact, only the vague memory left in the minds of my closest family. A memory that will quickly fade into the entropic maw of time. There is no afterlife for me, no god I pray to, no sense of divine judgment or justice. I am not an inherently spiritual individual, however I am inherently a hypocrite. Humanity’s nature is that of belief, in systems, in greater powers, in some sense of cosmic regularity. I once would consider myself a nihilist, but as I have grown into a facsimile of conscious thought I have found that human existence is not meaningless: We are livestock. 

At my birth my late mother liked to tell me I was no more than an inconvenience. She hardly had time to comprehend the intense strain of giving birth before I was in the doctor’s hands, silent as a dead man. She said when she looked into my eyes that rush of pure, selfless love she expected was simply not there. A hard thing to hear at the age of ten. Even harder still, was what came as I grew. My father was a ghost of a man, old and sickly, never one to teach me the rugged rituals of masculine thought. Instead he died. Quite shortly after my birth I may add. My only memory of him is the passing glance of an infant’s consciousness. He died while I was born, from some sort of cancer or bone disease, the cause escapes me now. All I know is that my mother deemed me the cause of it. She never said this to me directly, but it was apparent in her manner. The way she spoke to me, her lack of care towards me, the way she glared at me when she thought I wasn’t looking. My mother hated me, and I can't exactly blame her. 

Along with the coincidental death of my father in conjunction with my birth, I was plagued with disorders and behavioral issues all throughout my childhood. I became familiar with every symptom, every condition, every medication that they thought would fix me. None of them did, and it was from that subjugation I learned the second irrefutable fact of this existence; There is something deeply wrong with me, something that can never be fixed. 

My hometown was small and unremarkable, which made the constant disappearances all the more sensational. Naturally, in a town wrought with superstition and paranoia, I as an oddity became the subject of suspicion. Even though I was barely a year from elementary school, I was questioned, prodded, probed. My front yard, once littered with the aftermath of great battles drawn from my imagination, became a terrarium of which I was observed by those who thought I was a monster. If only they had known their true plight, unaware of the real horror that lurked just out of sight. Eventually the acts were pinned on a transient man from out of town, and he was gunned down while entering court. No one doubted the man’s guilt, or they were content to throw him on the pyre. Either way, they were all apathetic to his brutal end. I was the only one who knew the truth, and I would take it to my grave. 

I had no friends as a boy, left with my own imagination by a mother who couldn't care less about my whereabouts. I often ended up wandering the abandoned warehouses and mills that encircle the town. Ruins of an age long past, smokestacks and foundries that once pierced the sky with spires of jet black smoke. My mind would wander while I roamed these places, visions of roaring furnaces and the whir of machinery. I envy the men who toiled within those buildings. For them, life was a simple affair, one defined by an endless ouroboros. Life was work, and they were just another member of the hive. Hardship was simply meant to be hammered out like a piece of steel, broken bodies and patchwork minds dulled by vice were proofs of their own grizzled virtue. For even the most broken of men, life still held some glimmer of meaning through the dullness. On that day, my clearest memory is that of dullness. Gray clouds sailed through gray skies over dead fields and rundown buildings that dotted a flat horizon. I had gone farther than I usually would, my normal fears hampered by the inertia of my surroundings. My only companions were a family of portly rats that watched me carefully from the shadows, and scattered as the stones I threw crashed against the rusty steel roof. My adolescent mind sought more…  and it found me. 

Stretching across concrete like a drab island in a sea of cornfields, sat the old Packhouse. I approached down the main road, whacking apart the tall stocks of corn with a formidable oak branch I had found during my pilgrimage. As the corrugated behemoth came into view, sudden panic overtook me. Stories of the horrific were often unwanted companions to the imagination of a child, and the Packhouse was no different. A place of death, where animals were torn apart and packaged for consumption. An omen, if there ever was one.

Unfortunately, in that moment my juvenile mind decided to forgo the primordial instincts granted to me by eons of evolution, instead courting the notion of rationality. I persisted along my ill-fated quest, and entered the Packhouse. 

It was quiet as I slipped through a wide broken window, clambering down a haphazard pile of decaying rags. As my feet touched the concrete floor, a tangle of brutish pillars and corridors lay before me. I sat at the entrance of a labyrinth, and I dared to step inside. Twisting and turning through what felt like endless derelict rooms, each step I took filled my soul with a sense of impending dread, as if I would never return from this place. My only comfort was the weary light of day that limited my paranoia to the few dark shadows. Relief filled me as I passed through the last corridor, being spit out into the plant’s slaughter room. Pens and racks spanned the length of the space, scattered with mildew ridden boxes and abandoned machinery. Despite the cold sterile nature of the place, the remains of its previous occupants still stained the reddish brown concrete floors and an acrid scent of spoiled fat and dried viscera hung in the air as a specter. 

One detail of the floor commanded my attention, at the far edge opposite me was a large steel sliding door, firmly slid shut. It towered over the rest of the room, a rusted steel behemoth. It was featureless, except for a handle and a small square viewport that descended into benthic darkness. That small window pulled in my vision as the world around me disappeared. I saw nothing within that small square snapshot of the abyss, but I knew, somewhere in my primeval brain, that something was there, looking back at me. The growing voice of panic in the back of my head whipped into a storm of animalistic terror. Sweat began to form on my brow, the room felt damp and cold all at once. It became too much to bear and I turned to run. As my back turned to the dread behemoth, a shrieking whine filled the room. The sound of heavy steel being dragged across concrete echoed across the floor, reverberating through my bones. I froze, overwhelmed by pure fear like a fawn, praying that I would somehow become invisible. A horrid wail began to form in my throat, until a loud clang ended the auditory onslaught, and shocked me back into reality. I quickly spun to face the door, stumbling backwards until I found myself shuddering behind a table. 

Something dark and spindly flitted just out of sight, clutched at the corner of the door, before disappearing back into the now opened room. The long legs of a spider, but far too large, far too long. My eyes drew back into the darkness, a smell hit me. The smell of rot, of refuse, of death. My eyes watered as the odor stung my nose. It was only then when the contents of the locker were made clear to me. Just at the edge of the newfound light spilling into the room, before it was consumed by darkness, I saw them, they were barely silhouettes, but I saw them. Dozens of hanging corpses, swinging peacefully on creaking hooks. Some of their silhouettes still held limbs and heads, some were barely less than a lump of flesh. Between the hanging bodies, I saw it, that which haunts my mind. Between the corpses, was a face, an old woman's face, withered and cruel, smiling through haggard teeth with beady eyes that shone like cats’. The head bearing this face was far larger than any human’s, almost scraping against both the ceiling and the floor. As it stared into my eyes, through cracked lips, it began to speak. 

“Hello dear, are you lost?” 

A strange feeling washed over me at its words. The voice coming from its unmoving mouth was sweet and sonorous, like a mother comforting their child. My mind began to dull from its calming tone, obfuscating my thoughts. All the while however, those pinprick eyes bored through my soul, their intense hunger pulling from my soothed state. 

My voice caught in my throat as I sputtered out a gibbering reply. 

“It's alright, sweet child. Come here, I can help you find your way home.”

I could only respond with frozen silence. 

“Are you lost?” It repeated in an identical cadence. 

I was pulled forward on unseen strings, my feet lagging after my body before my shoe caught an edge and I stumbled to the floor. My hand pierced something sharp and rough. A sting shocked through my arm and I cried out in pain as I pulled my hand up, now bloody and torn. A rusted bone saw lay scattered across the floor, its blade now spotted crimson with my blood. As I stared at my mutilated hand, I felt a scream begin to rise within my chest. 

A loud groaning boomed through the room, as my attention snapped back to the locker. Just a few feet away, clung to the locker entrance, the thing sat. I could see it more clearly now, though as time goes the memory of its form begins to obfuscate. I remember its bulbous face looking down at me with yellowed eyes as big as my head. Foul smelling saliva pooling onto the floor. Its body winded in the darkness like intestines, attached to some unseen mass within. The thing drew even closer, the excited clattering of a thousand segmented legs scraping against the walls. As it approached, its face leered at me in elation, its pupils expanding across the iris like an eclipse. The creature's mouth hung open, a large pockmarked tongue quivered and shook in its fetid maw. Behind stood a dark void of muscle and saliva, one that sent gusts of hot stinking breath across my face, one that drew closer every second. The snapping and stretching of sinew echoed as the creature's mouth began to enclose me.  At this precipice, all the terror, the pain of my hand, the sorrow of my life, the loneliness, melted away from my adolescent mind. I was going to die a brutal, painful death… I was going to be eaten. 

I have never judged a murderer. Though I have never taken another person's life, there is a strange rush that fills you when you stand just at the edge of death. I can only imagine it feels the same taking a life. It is in those moments that a clarity of purpose is revealed, the desperate struggle for survival that defines all beasts existence is made manifest. 

I remember that moment as clear as day. Something sharp had found its way into my hand, something sharp and heavy. Before the thing's jaws snapped around me, it hesitated, letting out a horrific choking sound. I swung, letting out a hoarse cry of defiance, and hit flesh. There was a piercing scream, like that of a dying woman, and a burst of ochre fluid spilled over me. I scrambled back, before I broke out into a sprint. Concrete and steel became a blur as I tore my way through the Packhouse, all the while the thing’s voice boomed through the structure, reverberating off the walls. What was once a soothing maternal sound now burned through my body like a raging fire. Its words rattled from the depths of its throat, guttural and hateful. 

“ROTTED FLESH! POISON BLOOD!” It wailed, “GO! YOU ARE BAD MEAT! BAD MEAT!” 

Dull light offered me no relief as I burst into the day, the creature's words leaving my ears ringing. My feet slammed against the cracked pavement of the exit as I ran, leaving the Packhouse to become consumed again by the cornfields. I didn't stop, I remember that. I didn't stop for anything. I didn't stop until I got home. 

I knew no one would believe a kid like me, so I lied. I never spoke of what happened. I remember the stitches, I remember the scolding that followed the story of my unfortunate accident. I remember the sleepless nights, the nightmares, and the eyes. Most of all I remember a strange feeling, one that never left. I was spoiled, unfit for consumption. 

I'll be a father soon. I can only hope my daughter will inherit my misgivings, my flaws. My greatest hope for her is that she will be like me, broken and malignant. Humans are food, meant for consumption by the things that lurk within the void. I have no grand aspirations for her, no dreams of a better future. Humans are food, so I pray every night to the formless, shapeless god of chance that my infant child will be nothing more than a wastrel. A dreg, ill-suited even to be meat.
