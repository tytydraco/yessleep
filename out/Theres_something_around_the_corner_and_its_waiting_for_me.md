I moved into my own apartment two months ago, and thinking back on how excited I was to live on my own makes me want to throw up. Half a decade with shitty roommates had me flinging boxes into the first studio I could afford. Four hundred and fifty square feet sounded big at the time, but reality presented me with three tiny rooms to call home. The main space carves a block of dingy tile and concrete into the foundation of a Thai restaurant. A window the size of my hand leaks natural light onto the stained floor, and a lone fluorescent bulb lights the rest. Lastly, a small hallway snakes from the back of it, turning a corner that takes you to the bathroom and the “kitchen” (a sink, and a cupboard with a mini fridge on top of it).

It started on night one. I had a few celebratory beers over the successful move, and needed to christen the new bathroom. I stood out of the lone folding chair I had set up, and froze after the first step, my eyes stuck to the angle of the corridor. The bulb’s light struggled around the corner, leaving the darkness that lurked on the other side obvious. A lack of light was never my favorite decoration, but it hasn’t ever had this effect on me before. My whole body was stiff. I was unable to blink and barely able to breathe. Fear flooded my veins with ice, and unplaced adrenaline boiled the blood within. I felt like a cornered rabbit staring down a wolf, but my brain knew I was just looking at crusty, beige paint peeling off of an old wall. Regardless, my soul itself refused every neuron saying it was fine. 

I was unable to pull my gaze from the hall, but I forced my body to reach for the chair, fighting my muscles for every inch. I lifted the plastic seat and wrapped my fingers tight around the back legs, bracing to unleash my inner macho man on whatever sat just out of sight. I slid one foot forward. My jaw clenched. Second step, I entered the hallway. When I reached the corner I stopped. This fear was irrational, I thought. Just jitters caused by the new experience of living alone. It was then, seeking a reason for my own panic that I heard it for the first time. A deep, raspy breathing was barely audible on the other side. 

It was wet and broken, like someone with hiccups choking on their own vomit. At the same time, it was hushed. Barely audible over the soft hum of the street outside. It was almost masked entirely, but there, at the verge of rounding the corner, it was unmistakable. I even thought I caught half a word through the muck of noise. “-ee”. I raised my chair, took in as much air as I could, and swung around the corner with all of my weight.

The plastic punched a hole into the drywall, lodging my would-be weapon firmly in place. I instinctively stepped back, a reflex against whatever my mind convinced me to swing at. But nothing attacked. Nothing appeared, nothing breathed, it wasn’t anything. I was a sweaty, panting idiot staring into an empty slab box. I spent several minutes watching that slab box continue to be empty, waiting for some kind of Michael Meyers to present himself. Even more nothing. I blinked a few times, shook myself free of the stupor and made a vow to research panic attacks the next day.

A few weeks passed, and I was able to convince myself I had just been hearing things. The boxes got unpacked, the walls got a few posters, and I finally started to feel at home. One month after my move, to the hour, it happened again. I was washing my eight dishes and thought it’d be more fun with music. I left the running sink to grab my phone from the living room, but before I could even turn around, I felt it again. Primal horror encompassing my entire body. This time, I turned quickly to face it. Again, the light seemed like it was barely reaching around the corner, but I swear it had gotten darker. The two articles on panic attacks I skimmed taught me about breathing techniques that I tried to employ. They didn’t help, but the attempted taking in of air at least brought movement to my legs, enough to be able to reach my recently unpacked baseball bat. It may as well have been the chair. Even armed, my body shook as I inched closer. 

I heard it again. Louder this time. At the hallway’s threshold, the same labored breath crept from behind the corner. No fooling myself like last time, I heard it clearly, even over the faucet. Soggy, stuttering gasps formed a parody of what breathing should sound like. Once again, I was at the end of what I could see. I attempted to swallow, but my mouth was completely dry. My eyes narrowed, my grip tightened, and I swung. 

I put another hole in the wall, and the vibrations forced the metal bat from my hands. It was nothing. Again. But I knew I heard it this time. Not only was I sure I heard it, but in that final instant before the swing, a word emerged from the wheezing. Just one, nearly drowned out by the maw of whatever uttered it. “Two.”

This has shattered my life the past month. I couldn’t sleep, which caused me to get fired from my job. My savings don’t allow for a gym membership, let alone a new security deposit, so I’ve been stuck in this fucking basement. I’ve begged the old man who runs the Thai place for the bathroom code almost every day, but he stopped giving it to me a week ago after he caught me taking a sink bath. I had to turn that corner again, but I didn’t know how many times, if any, I could until it came back. I had the bat in my hand for weeks, staring down the hall, any kind of video playing in the background to keep the silence at bay. It wasn’t until today that the pattern showed itself.

Another month on the calendar, to the exact hour once again, I heard it. Loud this time. Viscous smacking over black lungs echoed throughout the twelve walls that form my coffin. The gloom reached from around the edge this time, beckoning me towards it. Though I was struck by the same paralyzing dread, I had been stewing in it for thirty days. The anxiety of waiting acclimated me to the nightmare. I was ready to face it. I shot out of my bed, and charged to the bend, screaming as loud as I possibly could. Even over my own blind shouting, The broken voice rang in between my ears. “ONE.” 

Again, I charged the bend to find nothing. I saw nothing, but I knew there couldn’t be nothing there. I’d heard it three times, I saw the darkness grow, the breathing, the words, all of it. I threw open the cupboards, then the mini fridge, followed by the bathroom cabinets, then the shower, and again I found it. Absence. Furious and terrified, and with no other outlet, I howled at the top of my lungs, and blindly threw the bat over my head and down the hall. The metal slammed against the wall and clambered loudly to the ground. My exhausted arms met my weakened knees. I stared at the ground in disbelief. When the pipe ceased its toll, I heard it. Heavy and dragged out with each rasp.

I looked up, and felt myself go pale. The light coming from the main room was completely blacked out, leaving only the chugging of its inhalation, and the dim outline of my surroundings. My eyes adjusted to make out long, black, pudgy fingers that crept into my half of the hallway. One set clung inches from the floor, the other less than a foot from the ceiling, each finger bending any way other than correctly. The staggered gasps became even more exaggerated. At that moment I realized, it’s not even breathing. It’s never been that at all. Whatever this thing is, it had been laughing at me the whole time.

The asymmetric rhythm of its unseen giggling bounced up and down in pitch, like it wasn’t sure how hard it should laugh at its cornered prey. Then, without warning, silence. A millisecond of quiet, before the torment I find myself in now. It showed itself. Just an outline of a sliver of its face was visible, but it was enough. Its eye caught a non existent light, a pinprick of white inside a pool of void. Matted strands of hair clung to bloated, pearlescent flesh that threatened to rip free of its host. The edges of curled, skin tight lips betrayed a wide grin. It gleefully peered at me, bobbing up and down sporadically in amusement, like a school bully mocking my clothes. 

Its appearance, how wrong it was, reminded me that I had a body. My fingers wrapped around the handle faster than I could think, and slammed the bathroom door shut as it began to pull itself from behind the wall. In the final moments before the door could shut, I saw the flaps that formed its mouth part. There wasn’t a flash of teeth. No gnashing fangs to pierce my skin. Just slimy strands of bile ebbing across its paper thin lips. Through my flimsy barricade, I heard its final words to me. “Ready or not.”

That’s where I’m writing this from. Sitting on the dank tiles of my dirty bathroom, firmly planted against the door. It’s not clawing, banging or trying to coax me out in any way, it’s just running one of its crooked fingers up and down the door. From the sound, I think it’s tracing my outline into the wood. I called the police, I’ve called my friends, I even tried calling my mom. It’s always the same. Rings once, picks up, and the breathing comes in so loud it threatens to break my eardrum. I’ve sent texts. I instantly get the same reply, every time, no matter who it’s to: *Here I come!*

I’m trapped down here. Something is waiting for me to turn that corner one last time. I’m just gonna type this out here and hope it gets through to you all. There is no help that can get here before something happens to me. All I have to offer you is one piece of advice. The next time your instinct says there’s something around a corner waiting to get you, listen to it. Something IS there, and it’s worse than what you can imagine.
