I know this sounds impossible, but every night I wake up to it—and it’s starting to take her from me.

I’ve had sleep paralysis before. I know what that feels like.

This isn’t that.

It started a few months ago. Shadows at the edges of my vision. Sounds I explained away. A slow dripping I blamed on the pipes, even though it only happens when I can’t move.

Then it started going after her.

I feel it before I see it. Something crossing the floor. Not quietly—never quietly—but carefully. A steady, split rhythm.

Tap.

Tap.

Too deliberate to be footsteps. Too patient.

When it comes into view, I can’t hold its shape. A hunched outline. Joints bending the wrong way. My eyes slide off it, like they don’t want to participate.

It stops at her side of the bed.

That’s when the whispering starts.

Not loud. Not threatening.

Wet.

There’s a steady drip from somewhere beneath where its mouth should be. Each drop lands between the sounds it makes, like the dripping is part of how it speaks. The words feel inverted. Breath pulled inward instead of pushed out. Like listening to language drown.

They aren’t meant for me.

They’re meant for her.

I try to scream.

My chest convulses. Air tears into my lungs. My heart slams against my ribs. I push with everything I have, and I hear myself screaming so loudly it drowns out the whispering entirely.

Except no sound comes out.

It feels like someone else is screaming inside me. My voice splitting, tearing itself into pieces, growing distant and unfamiliar. Lightheaded. Detached. On the edge of blacking out.

Still nothing.

Finally, I manage it.

“Leave… her.”

The words crawl out of me, broken and useless.

The dripping pauses.

It tilts its head toward me. The drip resumes—wrong, uneven, splitting into three staggered rhythms, like something inside it has shifted.

Then it leans closer to her.

The whispering continues.

She giggles. Soft. Sleepy. Unbothered.

And then, in that half-lost voice, she says:

“Now… I know everything.”

I know I’ve never said half of it.

When I wake up, she’s different. Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just enough to make me question myself. Sharper tone. Heavier certainty. She reacts to things I don’t remember saying.

“You always worry you’re not enough for me,” she says one morning, casually, like it’s an old joke.

I laugh too fast. Tell her I’ve never said that.

She looks confused.

“You didn’t say it,” she says. “You just think it really loudly.”

It happens more and more.

She brings up fears I’ve never voiced. Doubts I’ve swallowed because I love her too much to let them hurt her. Responds to accusations I never made. Apologizes for things I never blamed her for.

“I know you’d never say it out loud,” she tells me gently.

“Because you’re kind.”

That’s when I understand.

It isn’t lying to her.

It’s using me.

It doesn’t tell her what I want to say.

It tells her what I refuse to.

The things I protect her from. The thoughts I bury. The resentments I never give shape to because love taught me not to.

Every night, it pulls them out—drop by drop—and hands them to her until they sound like truth.

Some nights, there’s no dripping. No footsteps.

Just her voice. Familiar. Calm. Saying things I never meant to exist between us.

I try to tell her something is wrong. That I feel parts of me are being taken.

She smiles. Touches my arm.

“We’ve already talked about this,” she says.

I lie awake now, afraid to sleep.

Afraid that if I don’t hold myself together, there won’t be anything left to keep silent.

Sometimes I wonder if the screaming ever stopped.

Or if it just learned to sound like me.
