Yesterday, a rabid cat entered my mother's house and attacked everyone, including my brothers. They had to be hospitalized with serious injuries, bites, and scratches. It was surreal to hear such a thing as my sister, crying loudly, told me about it. My mother asked if I could come to her house and take care of the cat. I ran out of my home and drove there as fast as I could.

My sister was outside, covered in blood, screaming for help and crying. I laughed a little because it was only a cat, but she was truly terrified. It had been a long time since I had killed an animal. Maybe in my youth as a hunter in the northern forests of my country. But those days were long forgotten. Now, I was a common man living a normal life, with violence far behind me.

I told my sister to stay back. I grabbed a blanket and a knife, like in the old gaucho days. I had to be calm, knowing any wrong move could result in rabies. I entered the house and closed the door. The sound of the old wooden door echoed throughout the house, and I got goosebumps. Fear began to set in, and itâ€™s curious because sometimes this feeling makes you cold and immobile. I thought for a second to leave the house and call the police, but then again, my family was in danger.

I took a few steps and started whistling. From some corner of the house, I heard the cat growling, from low to high. It sounded like a demon or some unknown creature, an otherworldly menace lurking in the shadows. Those high-pitched screams made me tremble. They were a mix of screeching metal and the wails of tormented souls, piercing and relentless. Each scream sent shivers down my spine, making my hands shake.

I moved quickly to a corner to cover my back. As soon as I reached it, the cat appeared from behind a couch, eyes glowing an eerie red, mouth foaming with blood, and a missing tooth that added to its sinister appearance. Its fur was matted and patchy, giving it a ghastly, skeletal look. There was no turning back; it was me or the cat.

A bloodbath ensued. The vicious animal charged as soon as it saw me. We struggled, and I tried to avoid being bitten by the rabid creature. It leapt across the room, aiming for my neck, but I managed to pull out my knife and stab it in the heart. It fell quietly and softly. As it took its last breath, it let out one final, haunting scream that echoed through the house, chilling me to the bone. I closed its eyes, commending it to heaven.

It had been a long day, and I didn't want to take its life, but the threat was significant, and my family was at risk.

I buried it in holy ground while whispering, "Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven." I shed a tear while covering it with dirt. A stone was planted as a memorial. "Rest in peace, young nameless; for souls without names, heaven is forbidden." So my last act of compassion was to name the creature: Phylias.
