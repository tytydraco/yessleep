I've always been into the dark web. It's like this secret place where you can get anything you want - drugs, weapons, even human trafficking. But what really intrigued me were the creepy websites that people talked about.

So one night, I decided to explore the dark web for myself. I downloaded Tor and started looking around. Most of the sites were boring - just forums and marketplaces. But then I found one that caught my attention. It was called "The Dark Room."

The site was pretty basic - just a black background with a chat box in the middle. I typed "hello" and waited. Almost instantly, someone responded.

"Welcome to the dark room. You want a story?"

I figured, why not? "Sure," I typed back.

"Great. But first, I need you to do something for me."

That's when I started to get a little nervous. What had I gotten myself into? "What do you want me to do?"

"Close your eyes and count to ten. When you open them, you'll be in a new location. Don't worry - it's all part of the experience."

I hesitated for a second, but then decided to go for it. I closed my eyes and started counting. "One... two... three..."

When I got to ten, I opened my eyes. I was in a dark room. The only light came from a single candle in the center.

"What the...?" I muttered.

"That's better," a voice said from behind me. I turned around to see a figure standing in the shadows. I couldn't see their face, but they had a calm, soothing voice. "Let me tell you a story."

The figure started talking about a group of friends who had gone camping in the woods. One night, they heard a strange noise and went to investigate. They found a cabin hidden in the trees. The cabin was old and decrepit, but there was something weird about it - it felt alive.

As the group went inside, the door slammed shut behind them. They were trapped. And that's when they saw her - a woman in a tattered white dress. Her hair was all tangled and her eyes were black. She beckoned them closer and closer, until they were face to face.

And then, the figure in the dark room started to laugh. It was a sinister, chilling sound. "That's not even the scary part," they said. "You want to know what happened next?"

I was already on edge, but I couldn't resist the urge to hear more. "Yeah, what happened next?" I asked, my voice shaking a little.

"Well, the woman started to sing. It was this eerie, haunting melody that seemed to come from deep within her. And as she sang, the walls of the cabin started to move. They twisted and turned, like they were alive. And the woman - she just kept singing and singing, her voice getting louder and more intense."

I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. This story was really getting to me. "What happened to the group?" I asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.

"They were never seen again," the figure said, their voice still dripping with malice. "Some say they're still trapped in that cabin, listening to the woman's song for all eternity."

I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted out of this dark room, out of this twisted story. "Okay, I'm done," I said, starting to stand up.

But the figure moved faster than I thought possible. They were in front of me in an instant, their face inches from mine. I could see their eyes now - they were pitch black, like they were bottomless pits.

"You can't leave yet," they said, their voice barely above a whisper. "You haven't paid for the story."

I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. "What do you mean, paid?" I asked, feeling more and more trapped.

"You owe me a soul," the figure said, their lips twisting into a wicked smile. "And you're not leaving until I get it."

 I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding in my chest. It had all been a nightmare - the dark room, the twisted story, the figure with the black eyes. But as I sat up, I realized that something was wrong. My body felt heavy and sluggish, and I had a strange taste in my mouth.

I stumbled out of bed and made my way to the bathroom. As I looked in the mirror, I saw that my eyes were bloodshot and my skin was pale. And that's when I saw it - a mark on my neck, like someone had injected me with something.

I was terrified. I didn't know what was happening to me, but I knew it couldn't be good. And then I heard the voice again - the same one from the dark room.

"You belong to me now," it whispered in my ear.

I tried to fight it, to resist the pull of whatever was inside me. But it was too strong. I could feel it taking over, like a parasite invading my body.

And then, I knew what I had to do. I had to warn others about the dark web, about the dangers that lurked in the shadows. So I started writing - blog posts, Reddit threads, anything to get the word out. I told my story, and I urged others to be careful.

But even as I typed, I could feel the substance inside me growing stronger. It was like a cancer, spreading through my veins and taking over my thoughts. I knew that soon, I would be gone, lost to whatever dark force had taken hold of me.

So if you're reading this, please listen to my warning. The dark web is not a game. It's not some secret playground where you can indulge your darkest fantasies. It's a place of darkness, of evil. And if you're not careful, it will consume you, body and soul.
