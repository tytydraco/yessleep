Some day last year, I was home alone. My girlfriend had gone out run some errands. I went out into the backyard to clean up some dog poop. We have two doors leading to the backyard, one from our kitchen and another from our bedroom. These are thick wood security doors, both with deadbolt locks on them.

After finishing cleaning up, I went to go back inside through the door leading into our bedroom and to my surprise, it was locked. As someone with ADHD, my first instinct was to doubt which door I thought I remembered coming out of, so I decided to try the kitchen door instead. It was also locked.

Now I am thinking that my girlfriend must have come home and just locked the door or something, so I bang on the door to the kitchen, no answer. I open the gate to the front yard to see if her car is there, it's not. I consider crawling through our dog door, but now I am kind of freaked out and the thought of crawling on my hands and knees head first into the house just feels like a big NOPE. I decide to try the front door instead, and to my surprise it is unlocked. My girlfriend is notorious for forgetting to lock the door when she leaves.

I consider calling out, but decide that maybe I should first try to arm myself before announcing I am here to some potential attacker. It's a straight shot from the front door across the living room to my bedroom, I quickly bolt through into my room, go to my nightstand and get out my pistol. From there I go room to room, trying not to turn my back on an area I have not yet cleared. Nothing. I start doing an inventory of the house to see if anything is missing. There was an iPad laying on the dining table, right next to the front door. There was a PS5 in plain sight in the living room. Nothing appears out of place or missing.

I decide to maybe go take a look at the back doors to see if they somehow jammed or could have locked themselves. The deadbolts on both of them are fully turned to the locked position. Both of the doors are not properly aligned, and locking them requires pulling the door inward and turning the lock, making them difficult to even lock manually, and impossible for them to have locked themselves.

It doesn't make any sense. Why would someone come into my house just to lock me in my backyard and then leave? Was it a local kid pulling a stupid prank? I started texting my friends about what was going on to see if they had any ideas. That's when one of my friends told me that maybe I had a "phrogger". I'd not heard of the term before, but apparently it's when someone breaks into your house somehow and lives in your attic or walls.

I start looking for an entrance to my attic. In Arizona we don't really have large walk in attics, they are more like crawl spaces that separate your roof from the ceiling, full of insulation, not a place you'd ever really go into for any reason. I find the attic door hatch in my laundry room, directly above my stacked washer/dryer. When I say hatch, it is basically like a wood board that just sits in position over a square cut out. I go and get a ladder, put it down and start to climb up. 

When I get above the washer/dryer stack and look down I freeze with fear. There's hand prints and foot prints in the dust on top of the dryer. I start to shake a bit, and climb back down the ladder. I go and get my cell phone and call the police.

A couple of police officers come after about an hour. I explain my story and they seem skeptical, but they go have a look at the dryer. They ask me if its possible that my girlfriend had crawled up there for any reason, or if maybe I had recently, I tell them no. One of the officers decides to have a look, he climbs up on top of the dryer and lifts up the hatch. A bunch of insulation comes falling out all over the place. He pokes half his body up into the hole and looks around with his flashlight. He says it looks clear to him and comes back down. He also thinks that with how much insulation fell out when he opened the hatch, it would have been impossible for someone to have gotten up there without making more of a mess.

I don't really feel comforted by his conclusion, and I wonder how much of the attic he could really see from his vantage point. Could there REALLY not be someplace up there for someone to hide? We were just entering summer and the attic was pretty hot, and I got the feeling he just didn't want to go up there in the heat and get covered in itchy insulation. 

Anyways, the cops leave. My girlfriend comes home. Neither of us feel very good about what's going on, but what can we really do? I barely slept that night, and when I did sleep I had nightmares of someone crawling down from my attic and watching me sleep. I frequently got up and searched the whole house again and again. I checked the top of the dryer to see if any more dust had been disturbed, but it looked the same.

Finally, after a few days of no activity, my nerves calmed a bit, and I just accepted it may be a mystery that would never be solved. As I mentioned, it was pretty hot in that attic, there's no way someone could survive up there for days. I had also ordered an automatic lock for my front door, and a couple of security cameras, which gave me more peace of mind.

A couple of months later (how much later I am not really sure, I just know it was still hot outside) my house began to smell. After much troubleshooting, I determined the smell was coming from out of our AC ducts. I couldn't quite determine what it smelled like, it smelled sour, but also a little bit sweet. It reminded me faintly of a garbage dump, but not quite. My AC unit is on the ground outside, so I went and made sure something hadn't died in/under it, but everything looked normal and there was no smell outside. 

I thought perhaps it was mildew and that I had a leak in my wall, so I cut into the wall and the smell became much stronger, but I didn't find any leaking pipes. At this point I started to doubt what I was smelling and thought maybe I had a gas leak. I had the gas company come out and take a look, but they said that the smell was not gas, and their meter didn't detect any gas coming from the wall. The guy who was checking for a gas leak said that in his experience, the smell reminded him of a dead animal.

I started doing some research and basically either I pay someone a fair amount of money to potentially find the source of the smell and remove it, or I just wait it out and it will likely go away. I didn't really have the money to be hiring people to do something like that so I decided to wait it out and after a couple of weeks the smell went away. I sealed up the holes in the walls and hadn't thought about it much since.

Until today, I was thinking back, and I'd never really considered that those two events might be related. That maybe, there's a dead body in my attic.
