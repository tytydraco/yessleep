I spent the night a motel. I wasn’t going to set foot in that house for one more second after the noises I heard coming from the crawlspace and the replies in the railroad forum thread. I don’t know what I’m going to do about my living situation long-term, but for now I just had to get out of there.

I went to bed last night trying my hardest to forget about the tracks and move on, but one thought still nagged at the back on my mind: I still don’t know where the other end of the tracks went. I’d journeyed deep underground to find that awful burial chamber, but I hadn’t yet followed them into the woods to find the other end of the line. In retrospect it seemed like maybe that should’ve been my first course of action all along, rather than crawling down into the darkness of that tunnel. Surely some abandoned train tracks running through the woods couldn’t be that bad, right?

I decided this would be my last exploration. Then I would call the police to report what I found under my house, let them handle it, and move out of this town. I work remotely so it wouldn’t be too big of a deal, I just needed answers and had to get out of there.

I wasn’t going back into my house, so drove to the Bass Pro Shops on the edge of town and got heavy boots and overalls (to protect against the poison ivy and underbrush), a long-sleeve sweatshirt, a CamelBak, a high-powered flashlight, GPS watch (I just didn’t trust my phone anymore) a cheap metal detector, and a hunting knife.

I set off back to my property, a sense of dread building with every mile closer I got. When I finally pulled up outside my house, it was hard for me to even make eye-contact with it. Is making eye-contact with a house a thing? I got out of my car and walked straight to the backyard. With purpose I marched over to the back privacy fence and hopped over it into the thick brush on the other side.

Immediately it felt like I was in a different world. The suburban sounds of distant cars, sprinklers, and garage doors died away instantly, replaced by the rustling of leaves, chirping of birds, and buzzing of insects. Looking at the ground under my feet, I immediately knew I would have no hope of following the tracks visually. They’d been abandoned and buried so long that trees and brush were growing right up through them, with barely any indication that they were ever there.

Quickly I turned on the metal detector and swept it back and forth over the ground.

\*beep\*

\*beep\*

\*beeeeeeeep\*

It worked perfectly, giving a chirp whenever I swept it over the spot where I knew the tracks came through under my back fence, and sustaining a steady beep if I held it over the rails. With newfound confidence I began making my way through the thick forest. I walked for what felt like an hour, but was probably closer to 20 minutes. The going was slow thanks to all the underbrush, vines, and mature trees. The forest was thick, overgrown, and disorienting. Thankfully both my GPS watch and my phone still seemed to be agreeing with each other and pinpointed where I was.

I stopped for a second to take a sip out of my CamelBak when I heard it.

\*Scrunch\*

The sound of a footstep on leaves, coming from behind me.

I whipped around, suddenly on high alert. There was nothing behind me. Was I imagining things? Or maybe it was a small animal or the echo of one of my own footsteps?

I cautiously turned back around and took a few more steps forward.

\*Scrunch, Scrunch, Scrunch, Scrunch\*

Now conscious of just how loud the sound of my feet cracking through the underbrush was, I stopped again.

\*Scrunch\*

Just a half second after my my footsteps stopped, there it was again. Sounding like it came from maybe 10-15 feet behind me. Like someone was following me and stopping as soon as I did. I looked around again, unease rising and my heartbeat quickening. Still nothing. The woods were dead silent.

Wait.

That’s not right.

Where were the sounds of birds chirping, bugs buzzing, and squirrels running through the trees? It was like all the wildlife had suddenly completely disappeared. All sound for that matter, except for the faintest rustling of tree limbs. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. The air felt… electrified somehow, like I was trespassing somewhere I shouldn’t be.

I took another step forward, trying to quiet my footsteps as best as I could. I felt hard metal beneath me boot and realized that I could see the tops of the rails through the forest floor. Maybe the decomposing dirt had settled enough over time to uncover them, or maybe the tracks were simply built more elevated here, but whatever the reason I could now clearly see the rails poking above the forest floor.

A few feet in front of me a large tree was growing up right in the middle of the tracks, it’s roots crossing over the tops of the rails as though it was slowly consuming them. I stepped around its massive trunk and that was when I saw it.

Just beyond the large tree, the forest suddenly thinned out, and the ground became more uneven. The air felt different here—colder, heavier, as if the very ground was saturated with something dark, something unnatural. The tracks led into a massive clearing up ahead, but this wasn’t like any clearing I’d ever seen. It didn’t look like it had been cut down or cleared by fire; it was more like the forest simply refused to grow there. The ground was barren, covered only by tufts of dry, brown grass, and the few trees that bordered the edge were twisted and stunted like the ones you see halfway up a tall mountain, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The whole area felt wrong, like a wound carved out of the earth where nothing had the strength—or the will—to heal.

The ground was littered with chunks of crumbling stone. At first, I thought they were just rocks, but as I grew closer, I could see they were covered in chunks of mortar and appeared in straight lines, the remnants of old foundations. At the center of the clearing, half-buried in the dirt and overrun with dead weeds and ivy, was what was left of an old building.

Building might be giving it too much credit, the ruins were mostly rubble and barely visible, just a few broken walls and scattered stones, but it was clear that this place had once been large—massive, even. I could still make out the faint outline of a large rectangular stone foundation, and what looked like a broken column far ahead on the opposite side of the clearing. But it wasn’t the decay that unsettled me; it was the feeling that clung to this place, a sense of deep, pervasive dread that seemed to radiate from the very earth. It was as if the air itself was thick with the memories of something terrible, something that had happened here long ago.

I checked my phone; no service. I glanced at my GPS watch and it was simply blinking “Unable to Determine Location”.

I followed the tracks towards the ruins like I was being drawn towards them by a magnetic force, every fiber of my being helplessly trying to hold me back, until my foot caught on the sharp edge of something heavy and metallic, barely visible beneath a tangle of roots and weeds. I pulled it free, my heart pounding in my chest, and wiped away the dirt to reveal a thick metal cornerstone plaque that identified the place in which I was standing:

*Lippincott Asylum for the Criminally Insane.*

My blood ran cold. I’d never heard of the place before, but the name sent a chill down my spine. This wasn't just an old building—this was a place where people had been locked away, forgotten, and left to rot.

The tracks led straight through a wide gap in the stone foundation to what was once a large square room. I could see remnants of a tile floor under the loose dirt on the ground, and at the far end was a giant hulking mass, covered nearly completely by dead leaves and vines.

The tracks ended right in front of it.

I slowly walked towards it, knowing this mystery was almost at its end, feeling a combination of excitement, anxiety, dread, and fear rising with every step. As I got closer I tripped over a large square grate in the floor and landed hard, my face inches from the ground. The tiles were stained and darkened. Not evenly as if from age and wear, but in streaks.

Dark brown and black streaks and smears, leading from all over the room to whatever the giant brick mass in front of me was.

I stood up, inching closer, already knowing what it was but wanting to be wrong.

The thick brick walls and heavy iron door at waist height told me all I needed to know.

I was standing in the asylum’s crematorium.

I stood there staring at the place where they must have burned the patients’ bodies.

Dozens? Hundreds? Who knew.

I inched closer to the cremation chamber, my blood rushing in my ears. I pulled on the massive rusted door, and much to my surprise, it opened slowly, with a grating, screaming groan. I shined my flashlight inside and what I saw made my blood run cold.

There were scratches all over the inside of the soot-stained door and walls. Frantic scratches. Desperate scratches, as though someone—or many someones—had been trying to escape from the inside.

This wasn’t just a place for the disposal of bodies. No, this was something far worse. This was where they disposed of *people*, the unwanted, forgotten patients who had been shoved into the crematorium while they were still alive. My heart pounded in my chest as I realized the true horror of what had happened here.

I heard a deep clanging sound coming from somewhere beneath me. I spun around and realized it was coming from the grate in the floor. I took a step back as I began hearing desperate, wailing voices coming from beneath the ground all around me.

“They said they’d cut out the bad parts but they never stopped cutting!”

“It still hurts… you should feel it too.”

“My fingers- they’re all wrong. ALL WRONG!”

“I’m so cold, won’t you burn with me?”

I turned and ran. I ran as fast as I could. I had answers that I wished I didn’t, and all I wanted was to be as far away from that place as I could.

I ran until I couldn’t run anymore, until I heard the sound of birds chirping once again and my phone had service. I wasn’t going to follow the tracks back home, so I found the nearest edge of the woods on my GPS watch, which thankfully had begun working again, and walked to it as quickly as I could.

I’m now sitting in my car as I type this. I’m ok, I think, but nothing feels right. I feel like there’s a massive weight on my chest and I can’t shake it.

But I’ve made up my mind.

I’m never going back to that house.

I’m going to move.

I'm going to call the police to report what I found under my house.

I’m leaving.

i’m not going to move

i’m not going to call the police

i am not leaving

i am going back to the house

i will go back to the tunnel

they are calling

i am going home
