I was working the night shift stocking shelves during a blizzard on Christmas Eve. Our small local grocer—eerie as it may be when there are no customers inside—incentivized me to work by paying a little extra for the Holidays. My friend Gary and our team lead Tony were the only three in the store. That is until we discovered a small wooden Santa figurine behind a box of cereal. Gary knocked it down accidentally, and our disturbing night begun.

The figurine grew until it was as big as me.

“Are you guys seeing this shit or am I just a little too baked?” Gary said to us, rubbing his red, watery eyes.

Tony fell back to the ground awkwardly, which didn’t bode well for a man already in retirement age. I stood about ten feet from the Santa and said nothing, didn’t make a peep, because what we were witnessing was real. There was no ganja in me; I’m as straight-edge as you can be.

The Santa dusted off his red and white jacket and licked his lips. “Where are my milk and cookies?”

As soon as he spoke those words, I knew we were screwed. The store had been picked over because of the storm. I figured there may have been a gallon or two of milk left at best, and maybe one bin of cookies, but when the Santa walked to the other aisles to look for them, there was nothing left.

While the Santa maneuvered his way around the store, Gary and I lifted Tony up, and the three of us quietly followed the bearded man.

“Let’s get the fuck out of here,” I whispered to them.

After rummaging through some creamers, the Santa turned to us. “Milk and cookies!”

“I’m sorry, I think we are out,” Tony said.

The Santa charged at Tony, tackling him, and gnawed on his scalp until the top of his skull was at the same level as his eyebrows.

“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck,” Gary whimpered.

Gary’s whining drew the attention of the Santa, and before Gary could dart off, the Santa grabbed Gary and wrapped him in a bear hug, squeezing him until Gary passed out.

“Let him go,” I yelled.

The Santa ignored me and chomped down on Gary’s face, peeling flesh off like a sticker. I had seen enough. I bolted for the front door but then remembered it was locked. Tony had the keys.

I picked up a bag of bagels and dangled it in front of the Santa. “I’ve got your cookies right here. Come and get them.”

I hurled them over to the check out lanes. The Santa chased after them. I rushed over to Tony, snagged the keys, and then ran back to the store entrance. When the Santa realized what I threw was not a cookie, he came running over faster than I had seen him run before. The door opened and I was out just before he latched onto me.

I ran to my car, hopped in, and started the engine. The Santa pounded his fists on the windshield. Just as I sped off, the Santa jumped onto the hood of my car, and somehow managed to hang on while I pushed it up to thirty miles per hour.

There was a light at the end of the tunnel though: a convenience store open past the midnight hour. When the Santa peeked his head over my driver-side window, I flung the steering wheel right and crashed into a pole just in front of the store.

The cashier ran outside to investigate the noise. The crash was strong enough to send the Santa flying into a bush. I got out of the car and ran inside the store, pulling the cashier in with me.

“Milk, he needs milk and cookies,” rolled off my tongue.

“Get out of here you crazy nut job or I’m calling the cops,” the cashier said. “Are you strung out on something? Damn teenagers.”

I ran over to the fridges and grabbed the largest milk I could find.

*Ding*

The Santa stepped foot inside the store and went right for the cashier, swiping at his chest, pulling his insides out effortlessly.

“Milk. I’ve got your milk,” I screamed.

In front of me, I also noticed a box of cookies. “And cookies, I’ve got your cookies. I really do, I swear.”

I tossed the milk and cookies at the Santa and watched him devour them, reveling in every last drop to the point that he actually smiled. I had no intention of sticking around, so I tiptoed my way behind him while he feasted. My car still worked, so I got out of there before any more carnage took place. 

I don’t know what happened to the Santa. Nobody ever saw him again. The authorities wrote a report saying a crazy man dressed as Santa murdered three men. I never stepped foot again in that grocery store.
