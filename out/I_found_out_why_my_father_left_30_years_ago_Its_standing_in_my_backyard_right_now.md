When I was a kid, my mother had a foolproof way to get me to sleep. She'd stand in my doorway and whisper: "Sleep now, or she'll come for you."

I'd squeeze my eyes shut immediately. Every time.

I'm 34 now. I moved back in with Mom six months ago. Same house I grew up in.

Three nights ago, I woke up at 2:47 AM.

Mom was standing in my doorway.

"Sleep now, or she'll come for you."

Her voice was weird.

I sat up. "Mom?"

She turned and walked away.

In the morning, I asked her about it.

"Sleepwalking probably," she said, not meeting my eyes. "I haven't said that in years."

She was lying. I could tell.

The next night, I couldn't sleep. I watched my doorway.

2:47 AM.

She appeared.

"Sleep now, or she'll come for you."

"Mom, who's coming for me?"

Nothing. Just standing there.

I got out of bed. "Mom, wake up."

I reached for her shoulder. She grabbed my wrist. Her hand was ice cold. Then she blinked, and it was just Mom again. Normal. Confused.

"Why am I—" She looked at her hand on my wrist and jerked back. "Oh god. Again?"

She sat on my bed. Her hands were shaking.

"It started three weeks ago. I'd wake up in different rooms. Missing hours." She finally looked at me. "Your father left because of this. He recorded me once. I was standing in our bedroom at 3 AM, saying 'She'll come for you' to nobody."

My mouth went dry.

"I made him delete it. It stopped after a while. Until now." She stared at my doorway. "But before, I wasn't walking to your room."

We agreed to lock our doors.

Last night, I woke up at 2:47 AM.

My door was wide open.

I lock it. I checked three times.

Mom was in the hallway, facing the stairs. Not moving.

"Mom?"

"She's here."

I ran to her. She was ice cold, stiff.

"She came for you. But you didn't sleep. So she came for me instead."

She started walking toward the stairs. I grabbed her, pulled her back. She collapsed against me, suddenly warm again. Crying.

"I saw her this time."

"There's nobody—"

"At the bottom of the stairs." She was sobbing. "Waiting. Not anymore. You woke me up. But she was there."

She grabbed my shoulders. Her eyes were huge.

"You have to sleep. When she comes to you, you have to be asleep."

"Mom—"

"When you were three, you stopped breathing. Four minutes." Her nails dug into my arms. "I heard footsteps in your room first. I ran in. You were blue. And an old woman was standing over your crib."

My chest felt tight.

"She was so tall. Too tall. Wearing a nightgown with dark stains down the front." Mom's voice was shaking. "She was humming. And those long fingers were pressed against your chest."

"Stop."

"I screamed. She turned to look at me. Her hair—it was white, down to the floor, covering her face. It moved by itself. Like it was alive. And underneath—" Mom's voice cracked. "Her mouth. Too wide. She smiled at me and the skin cracked at the corners. She said 'If he stays awake, I'll come back.' In my voice. My exact voice."

I tried to pull away.

"Then she bent down over you—her spine curved wrong—and she breathed in through her mouth. This long, rattling breath. And you started breathing again." Tears were running down Mom's face. "She straightened up and walked into your closet. Her nightgown left wet marks on the floor. Then she was just gone."

"That's not—"

"So every night, I made you too afraid to keep your eyes open." She let go of me. "She's been waiting thirty years."

She walked to her room. The lock clicked.

I went back to my room. Closed the door. Locked it.

I couldn't sleep. Obviously. So I did what anyone would do—I opened my laptop and started searching.

Mother sleepwalking saying threats

Parasomnia violent episodes

Sleep disorder repetitive phrases

I found forums. Reddit threads. Medical sites. Dozens of people describing similar things. There were explanations. Medical explanations. This happens to people. It's documented.

I just looked up from my laptop.

My mind is playing tricks on me. It has to be.

Because I think there's something tall standing in my backyard.

But I'm looking at it right now through my window.

I'm in bed with my phone.

What should I do?
