We rented an Airbnb in the middle of nowhere in my home state of North Dakota. I live 15 miles outside of Fargo, but the place we rented is about 20 miles northwest of Carrington. I'd say growing up in North Dakota, you really have to get used to the fact that sometimes you are just seeing things that aren't there. I heard that our brains detect eyes faster than our own eyes do, so if you see something moving in the darkness, it is our brain detecting eyes, and it will trigger a sense of danger. I can usually tell if I am looking into animal eyes at night, especially deer; we have basically nothing else here. However, I am positive that what I was looking at on our second night at the Airbnb was not animal eyes but human ones.

I went on the trip with my friends Lexi, Kyla, and her boyfriend Mike. We also brought Kyla's dog, Joey. He is probably the most awkward dog in the universe. Kyla always says he needs his own emotional support dog, which is ironic because they got him to be a protector as he is a Doberman and German Shepard mix. So when he refused to go outside when I took him to use the bathroom, I thought it was him being awkward. I finally got him outside, and when we got down the porch steps, he just froze in place for maybe 20 seconds before he rushed back inside, leaving me alone in the darkness. It is late fall, so it is not absolutely freezing yet. I am also not stupid, so I did have my phone flashlight on. I wasn't too worried about people being out here, especially at this time. In rural North Dakota, you rarely have to worry about strangers wandering rural lands, too. I looked around to see if I could see anything, and I saw movement 50 feet in front of me. It was in the tree line right behind the house. I focused on it, assuming it was probably a deer. I brought my flashlight up, and I saw the glow. I couldn't help but feel scared. I couldn't make out anything other than the glow of the eyes. Usually, I can tell if it was a deer, but this felt different. I didn't want to investigate any further, so I just went inside and locked the door.

I told my friends what happened, and they thankfully didn't call me crazy. They looked out the kitchen window that faced the back of the house and looked into the dark tree line to see nothing. We all assumed it was a deer, and I was just scared because I was alone out there. We locked every door and all of the windows before getting ready for bed, just to make sure I felt a little less freaked out.

Lexi and I shared a room, but this night I decided to sleep in the living room. For my job, I usually work from 5 pm to 1 am, and trying to sleep at 11 pm just wasn't cutting it for me. I also wanted to keep an eye on everything, but for some reason, I had a dumb idea to watch the Blair Witch Project. I wish I could say I was just freaked out from the movie, but when the last scene wrapped up around 2, I swear I heard a knock on the front door. It sounded more like a tapping, almost. The door is right behind the big lounge chair I was sitting in, so any noise that could come from the front door, I would be able to hear. I kept thinking to myself, 'Who the fuck is that?' I didn't make any noise, and I paused the TV. The only light in the living room at this time was the TV, but it was on a black screen at this point. I stayed silent for what felt like 10 minutes before I heard a voice outside whisper. I couldn't make out anything it said, but I reached for my phone and called Mike. I knew he was sleeping, but I just hoped he would answer. It rang for 30 seconds, then it went to voicemail. I hung up and called him again, only to receive no answer again.

I stayed still, just waiting, hoping that I had not heard what I thought I heard. I sat there in silence for a few more minutes before ultimately deciding that if I don't check now, I may never know what is out there. I was still scared shitless, so just imagine a terrified woman slowly sliding off a chair and down to the floor quietly and crawling to the living room window. I pushed the curtains aside and looked up over the ledge. Outside the window was the front of the house, and I could see the driveway with my car and Mike's pickup dimly lit up by the porch light. My eyes then scanned over to the source of light and looked at the empty porch. I blew out a sigh of relief and pulled myself up to my feet while still looking outside. I finally had enough scares for the night and decided to go back to the shared bedroom and sneak into bed silently.

The next morning, when I went to the kitchen for breakfast, Kyla brought up last night.

"Mike said you called him twice last night. Did something happen?"

I was reluctant to tell the truth because I knew I would be made fun of, "Oh, I did? I woke up sleeping on my phone, so maybe I butt dialed him." I didn't want to explain to everyone how I freaked myself out the night prior and believed that someone was outside.

Everything that day went by as normal until we got back from our trip to town to get groceries. We were laughing and making fun of Mike until he stopped at the front door.

"Guys, wait. Apparently, I forgot to lock the door before we left." He laughed as he swung the door open and just waltzed in.

Kyla, right behind him, said, "What? No. You took forever trying to lock the door, remember?"

I looked up to Lexi walking right in front of me. "Aww, maybe he didn't want to admit defeat," she mocked, and Mike rolled his eyes. I thought it was just a coincidence, but looking back, I definitely should've said something to my friends earlier.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That night we watched a movie in the living room. Kyla and Mike were cuddling on the love seat, Lexi was in the lounge chair, and I was in a pile of blankets and pillows on the floor, cuddling with Joey. All of the lights in the house were off, but we decided to keep the porch light on like the night before. As the movie went on, the conversation between my friends and me died down as both Mike and Lexi fell asleep before the movie finished, leaving Kyla and me to be the ones to clean up.

I was about to get up to turn on a lamp when I heard the tapping again. It sounded louder than last night's knocking; it echoed through the room. I looked over to Kyla, who was looking at me wide-eyed. As glad as I was to know I wasn't hearing things, it made me even more uneasy knowing the noise was real.

"Girl, what the fuck was that?" she asked, which was soon followed by another set of taps. Joey got up from beside me and stood right in front of the window; the fur on his neck stood up. However, he stayed silent; this was strange behavior for him because he usually starts barking if he hears a bird blink outside. "Something's tapping the glass," Kyla whispered before ushering me to check.

I pulled the blanket off of me and crawled over to the glass with just as much, if not more, fear running through my veins than last night. The only saving grace is Joey next to me. I reached up to move the curtain and froze when both heard the voice. The sound of a muffled 'stop' made its way into the room. Kyla grabbed onto Mike and began shaking him awake. He woke up alarmed, almost yelling, before he felt Kyla shushing him. He sat up and looked at Kyla, confused, then looked to me and Joey sitting right in front of the window on the ground. My face felt warm, and I could feel the burn of tears filling up my eyes.

"There's someone out there," she whispered in his ear as quietly as she could. He quickly got up and took a step before she grabbed his arm. He pulled his hand away and made a shushing motion at her.

"Who's out there?" Mike said sternly before turning on the lamp. I was close to slapping him so hard he would taste my hand for a week, but we heard a thump outside followed by shuffling. Mike quickly moved next to me by the window and threw open the curtains. I looked outside by the cars, nothing, then to the front door, no one. I turned my head to the left. The bottom of the window was foggy apart from a very apparent handprint, sideways, on the bottom. I screamed and jumped back. The thud of my body slamming against the floor woke up Lexi. Joey's barking began to fill the room as he focused on the handprint. As scary as this situation was, what made it more terrifying was that the window in the living room was not close to the ground outside at all. Let alone the long flowerbed that wrapped around the window would make it impossible to touch, even if someone was insanely tall.

"Call the cops! Call the cops, now!" Mike yelled as he stared out the window. Joey's barks didn't falter as Kyla fumbled with her phone before holding it up to her ear.

It took about half an hour for the sheriff of Foster County to arrive. One of the deputies spoke with Kyla first, then Mike, then me. I told him about what happened the night prior, how I should've said something sooner. I felt guilty; maybe if I spoke up, we all wouldn't be terrified.

The sheriff and a few other deputies took their sweet time surveying the land around the house. They spent maybe 45 minutes searching, to no avail. They combed through the tree line and even asked one of the neighbors a mile away if they had seen anything. Nothing.

"Look, we know you all are scared. It's probably one of the neighbor's kids, or some drunk kids trying to scare you guys. We don't sense any immediate danger or any danger at all, for that matter. If anything else happens, call us immediately, and we will send someone out for you." With that, the sheriff and all of his deputies took off.

We collectively decided to stay for one last night at the Airbnb, and tomorrow we would drive to Kyla and Mike's.

The rest of the night was pretty uneventful. We all decided to stay in the living room for the night just in case anything happened. There were a couple of times we thought we heard tapping. The second one of us heard the first tap, we shot up and looked out the window, only to see nothing. Eventually, we all peacefully drifted into sleep.

The next morning, once all of us woke up, we wasted no time in packing everything we had brought. Kyla and Mike got on the road around 11, Lexi and I maybe 20 minutes after, as we wanted to walk around the property to look for any 'clues of a stalker' as Lexi put it. We didn't find much, but we noted one thing. There was a crawl space under the flowerbed of the living room window, however locked.

"I mean, the sheriff definitely would've noticed that and said something about it if he thought it was an issue," Lexi told me. I confided in Lexi about how I was just feeling uneasy, not scared or worried, just a little off.

We were an hour into our drive back towards Fargo and as Lexi was looking through my CD collection, I got a call from Kyla. The second I hit the green button, Kyla's booming voice caused us to flinch.

"What the fuck is wrong with you guys!" she yelled at us.

Lexi was quick to answer, "What? Girl, calm down!"

"Don't tell me to calm down! The owner of the house just told what you guys did! Now I have to pay an extra two hundred dollars for that damn door and lock!"

"Wait, what are you talking about? We didn't do anything," I tried to reason with her.

"Jemma! I saw the fucking photo."

"Kyla, what photo! We didn't do anything!" I turned on my blinker, and I took the next exit so I could pull over.

You could practically hear her eyes rolling through the phone before coldly saying, "I'm sending it to Lexi." The car rolled to a stop, and Lexi tapped on the image that popped up on her phone. She looked at it and froze, which made me lean over to scan the screen, and my breath stopped

The familiar stinging welled up in my eyes again. "Kyla, that wasn't us."

The photo was taken from outside the front of the house, right below the flowerbed. The crawlspace door was the main focus of the image. However, instead of it being closed and locked, the door lay flat on the ground. Blankets that were filthy and covered in dirt sat right inside.

"Well, whatever the fuck 'wasn't you', let animals inside, there was a fresh dead bunny, he told me." Both Lexi and I stared at the image silently, chills ran up and down our bodies. "Jemma, look, I know this trip was for you, but after everything that's happened, I think you should just go home for now. Mike is pissed, and to be frank, so am I."

"Kyla, it seriously wasn't us!" Lexi defended.

Kyla was quick to respond, "I am upset, I don't want to say the wrong thing. Please, can you guys just stay at home for one night?" She sounded defeated and beaten. Lexi and I agreed and hung up the phone before putting the car in drive.

We spent the rest of the car ride mostly in silence. I dropped Lexi off at her apartment in Fargo and drove back to my house. Which is where I am now. I don't know if I should still be worried about what happened at the Airbnb, or if it was simply just a random, maybe homeless person. If anyone could give me any advice on what to do here, please let me know. If anything else happens, even if nothing happens, I will still update.
