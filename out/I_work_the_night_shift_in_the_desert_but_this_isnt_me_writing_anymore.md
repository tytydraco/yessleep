You ever wonder what kind of job makes a man come apart at the seams—fracture not over weeks or years, but in one single, black-lunged night?

Not from stress. Not from boredom. But from something else. Something dry and crawling that licks at the edge of your sanity like windblown sand against old bone.

Yeah, I used to wonder that too.

Now I don't wonder much of anything. My thoughts come slow, like they’ve got to drag themselves up through molasses. I don’t sleep—not really. When I do, I hear the whispering. I see flickers in corners that should be empty. I don’t trust my reflection anymore. I don’t trust my own voice. Something came back with me from that place. Something I never invited.

The job was simple—or so I thought. One night shift in the middle of nowhere. And a list of rules. Just twelve of them. Keep your head down. Stay awake. Follow the rules. But rules mean nothing when the air itself wants to gut you. When silence starts to hum. When shadows breathe.

Let me take you back to the beginning.

My name’s Eric. I’m 28 years old, though now I feel older—worn down like desert stone under centuries of wind. I’ve never been the stay-in-one-place kind of guy. I’ve chased hurricanes on oil rigs, run toward wildfires when everyone else ran away, and even launched myself off rooftops for a few thousand YouTube subscribers back in the day. I guess you could say danger was my drug. I didn’t just flirt with risk—I waltzed with it, arms wide, laughing in its face.

So when I saw the job post—a night watch gig at an isolated weather station in the far reaches of West Texas—it felt like a gift. The pay was suspiciously good. The location? Dead center of the xyz Desert, fifty miles off any real road. No towns. No neighbors. No signal. Just a pin on a map and a time to show up.

I packed light: books I wouldn’t read, a journal I wouldn’t write in, and that stupid optimism only people who haven’t been broken yet still carry.

The outpost—Station 119B—was a concrete box. One room. No markings, no signs of life. Just a dented steel door and a big black window staring out at an endless stretch of sand. Inside, there was a desk cluttered with equipment I couldn’t name, a fridge, a cot, and a generator that sounded like it was one bad night away from dying. But what caught my attention wasn’t any of that.

It was the manual.

A thin, grease-stained pamphlet on the desk, labeled in crooked red ink:

RULES FOR NIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR – STATION 119B

Not instructions. Not training. Rules.

There were twelve.

And they weren’t the kind of rules you find in HR handbooks. They read like folklore passed down from some ancient desert cult.

1. Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.  
2. If you hear tapping on the window, turn off all lights and lie face down until it stops.  
3. Log wind speed every 30 minutes. If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.  
4. If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.  
5. Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.  
6. If the desert goes silent (no wind, no bugs), recite the phrase taped to the fridge.  
7. Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base Code: Yellow Echo.  
8. If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.  
9. Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.  
10. Don’t fall asleep.  
11. Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.  
12. If Rule 1 is broken, burn the manual immediately and pray.  

I read them again. And again. Each pass made my skin prickle. It was like reading a curse disguised as policy. But instead of walking away, I laughed. Really laughed—sharp, barked out loud like a man who thinks he’s above fear—because I was still the guy who thought ghosts were fun stories and rules were made to be tested.

It sounded strange in that room—too loud, too human. It bounced off the concrete walls like it didn’t belong there. Maybe it didn’t.

In my head, this was all just some elaborate hazing ritual. A creepy prank left behind by some disgruntled ex-employee with a flair for drama. I imagined a guy like me—bored, probably high—scribbling down those rules just to mess with the next poor sucker assigned to Station 119B. The candle, the weird times, the chanting. Classic psychological tripwire stuff. Probably some government joke I wasn’t in on.

Still… the place didn’t sit right with me.

The air was too dry. Not just desert-dry, but hollow, like the atmosphere had been scooped out. The silence felt rehearsed. Choreographed. And the stars above the station—they didn’t twinkle. They just watched. Cold, close, too sharp. Like pinholes poked through a thin sheet of sky. If you stared too long, you got the feeling something might stare back.

But I told myself, I’ve jumped out of planes. I’ve stood on collapsing fire lines. I’ve put my own damn hand in a box full of scorpions on a dare for likes. What’s a little ghost story in the desert?

The first couple hours passed like I expected: dull, dry, and quiet. I logged the wind speed like Rule #3 said, every thirty minutes. I even timed it with my watch to be precise—treating it more like a chore than a warning. I made some instant coffee that tasted like regret. I watched a tarantula the size of my palm crawl across the outside of the window—slow, aimless, like it knew it was being watched.

Then, around midnight, things started to… bend. Not snap. Not break. Just bend, subtly, like the world had gone a few degrees off center.

It was 12:11 AM when I heard the knock.

A sound so ordinary it felt impossible for it to feel so wrong.

Not banging. Not frantic. Just three knocks—spaced out. Intentional. Like whoever was outside wasn’t asking to be let in. They were stating they were already here.

Every hair on my neck stood at attention. My hands clenched around the mug before I realized they were shaking.

My mind stumbled back to Rule #1: Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.

I froze. My thoughts tried to be logical, tried to be brave. Probably just the wind, I whispered to myself, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.

But the wind doesn’t knock. It howls. It hisses. It dances through cracks and moans through empty places. It doesn’t walk up to a reinforced steel door and knock three times, exactly, then stop.

I checked the wall clock.

12:13 AM.

My throat tightened like I’d swallowed dry sand. My legs screamed to move—toward the door, away from it, I didn’t even know. But I stayed still. Not because I believed the rule. No, not yet. But because something in my gut, something primal and old, told me that opening that door would be a very final kind of mistake.

The knocks came again. Same rhythm. Three. Then silence.

12:20. More knocks.

12:29. Again.

12:41. They kept coming—every few minutes. Always three. Always the same weight behind them. As if the thing on the other side had all the time in the world.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t speak. I just sat there, heart hammering, watching the second hand crawl across the clock face like it was moving through tar.

Then came the tapping.

Not on the door.

On the window.

A soft, delicate tap-tap-tap, like fingernails on glass.

I turned slowly—deliberately—expecting to see something. Anything. A face. A shape. But the window showed only the dark, stretching desert. Pale sand under a black sky. Empty. Still.

Then: tap-tap-tap.

Right against the glass. Closer this time. More urgent. Like whatever was outside had grown impatient.

Something deep in me—some instinct older than thought—screamed to obey the manual.

I threw the lights off and dropped flat to the floor, face down, just like Rule #2 demanded.

And let me tell you—I felt ridiculous. Lying on cold concrete like a scolded child playing hide and seek. My breath echoed in my ears, too loud, too fast. The tapping continued—soft, steady, like it was trying to coax me up.

I didn’t move.

The darkness stretched forever.

Finally—mercifully—the tapping stopped.

I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, slowly, I pushed myself up, muscles aching from the tension. I flicked the lights back on and blinked into the sterile brightness.

Then, like a complete jackass, I laughed at myself.

Real mature, I thought. Terrified by shadows and knocks like I’m in a Halloween special.

But the laughter didn’t stick this time. It crumbled in my throat like dry paper.

Because as I stood there, letting my pulse settle, my eyes drifted toward the wind monitor on the desk.

And it was flatlining.

Zero.

No wind. Not even a whisper.

My stomach dropped.

Rule #3 roared back into my mind like a siren:

If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.

And suddenly, I wasn’t laughing anymore.

I checked the wind monitor again, hoping—praying—I’d read it wrong.

Wind Speed: 0 mph.

Nothing. Not a breeze. Not a whisper. The line on the graph was dead flat, like a heartbeat that had given up.

My chest tightened—squeezed from the inside like my lungs were folding in. That couldn’t be right. Out here, the wind never stopped completely. Even the still nights carried a faint, restless stir through the sand. But now? The world outside was holding its breath.

I should’ve stayed inside.

But something pulled me toward the door. Not curiosity—denial. That desperate human instinct to confirm the lie, to tell yourself everything’s fine if you can just see it for yourself.

I stepped outside.

And immediately felt the weight of a mistake settle on me like lead.

The air was… wrong. Not just calm—dead. Still in a way that felt manufactured, unnatural. Even my own breathing sounded too loud. There was no wind. No rustle of dry shrubs. No skittering bugs. Nothing but the crunch of my boots on sand.

The desert had gone mute.

And then I saw them.

Footprints.

In the sand, just a few feet from the threshold.

Coming in.

But none going out.

I stood there for a full, frozen second, my body refusing to catch up to what my brain was screaming. Then instinct kicked in—I spun, bolted for the door, slammed it shut behind me like it might keep something out that had already gotten in.

Lock. Chain. Bolt. I checked everything. Hands trembling. Breath sharp and uneven.

And then my stomach twisted as another rule clawed its way up from memory:

Rule #7: Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base. Code: Yellow Echo.

The satellite phone was right where it had been—on the desk, a grey relic from another era. I grabbed it like a lifeline, dialed the code with fingers that barely obeyed me.

It rang.

Once.

Twice.

Then it connected.

And what I heard next nearly stopped my heart.

It was my voice. But not like a recording. It was live. It was me. Except it wasn’t. The cadence was slightly wrong. The tone a hair off. Too calm. Too final.

"You shouldn’t have opened the door," it said.

Click.

Silence.

I stood there, staring at the receiver like it might explain itself. Then I yanked the cord from the back. The phone went dead.

That’s when the lights cut out.

All at once.

Like someone had flipped a master switch on reality.

Total blackness swallowed the room. The kind of black that has depth. Like it could reach out and touch you back.

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.

Then my memory jolted into motion—Rule #4: If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.

I scrambled to the shelf, nearly knocking over the chair in the dark. My fingers found the candle—a thick, stubby thing already set in a glass holder. I fumbled for the lighter, struck it, and lit the wick with a hand that couldn’t stop shaking.

A small, flickering flame sprang to life.

And the room changed.

The dim red light didn’t just reveal the space—it warped it. Shadows twisted too far into the corners, stretching longer than they should. The air shimmered, barely perceptible, like heat off asphalt—but colder. The walls felt too close now, as if the room had been inching inward, shrinking around me when I wasn’t looking.

I turned slowly, and for just a breath, I thought I saw movement in the reflection of the window. Not a shape. Not a face. Just shifting. The kind of thing your brain registers an instant too late.

That’s when I heard it.

A whisper.

Soft. Barely audible. But unmistakable.

"Eric."

My name.

It wasn’t shouted. It wasn’t angry. It was… gentle. Almost caring. Like the voice of someone who knew me. Loved me. Wanted me to trust it.

But it didn’t come from the door.

And it didn’t come from outside.

It came from somewhere. From everywhere. Inside the room. Behind the walls. In the space under the cot. In the reflection in the window I wasn’t supposed to look at. My skin crawled. My mouth went dry. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to run for the door by itself.

Rule #5: Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.

But was it outside?

I didn’t know.

And that’s what terrified me most.

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself not to move. Not to speak.

The voice came again.

"Eric," it whispered. Closer this time. Like it had crossed a threshold.

Like it was already inside.

I clutched the manual like a child clings to a teddy bear in the dark, desperate for comfort that paper couldn’t possibly give. My arms wrapped around it as if the ink inside could somehow shield me from whatever else was breathing in that room with me.

Then I heard it.

The fridge.

Buzzing.

Low, mechanical. A sound so ordinary it shouldn't have chilled my blood. But in that moment, it was like hearing a coffin creak open by itself. My eyes snapped open. The red candle flickered wildly, the flame stuttering as if suffocating in air that was too still, too heavy.

Then came the silence.

Not quiet—silence. The kind that doesn’t just fill the room but consumes it.

No wind. No bugs. No low hum from the machines that had kept me grounded in reality for the past few hours. Even the candle’s flicker made no sound.

Just an aching, crushing stillness.

Rule #6. My breath hitched.

I bolted toward the fridge, legs trembling like they didn’t belong to me. My fingers scrambled along the metal door until they found it: a small, weathered strip of paper taped just above the handle.

The writing was faint, as though the ink had tried to escape the words it formed.

“O watcher of dusk, I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”

My lips moved before I could think.

“O watcher of dusk…” I began, my voice cracking like an old record. “I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”

It felt like trying to speak underwater. My tongue stumbled over the rhythm the first few times, the words sticking to my throat like glue.

I repeated the phrase. Again. And again. Louder.

And then—I heard it.

The silence shattered.

A sudden gust slammed against the walls of the outpost, making the concrete groan in protest. Wind howled through unseen cracks. Insects returned in a chorus of buzzing, scratching life. The room breathed again.

And I—God help me—I nearly cried.

But the relief lasted all of three seconds.

Then the phone rang.

That shouldn’t have been possible.

I had unplugged it. Pulled the cord straight out of the back. I stared at the empty socket, then at the receiver.

It rang again.

And again.

Three times total.

Rule #8 screamed through my skull: If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.

I already had.

I backed away, the manual still clutched in one hand, candle in the other. My eyes flicked to the wall clock.

2:51 AM.

And just like that, another rule surfaced.

Rule #9: Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.

I hadn’t meant to. I swear I hadn’t.

But the moment I thought it, I looked.

And that’s when I saw it.

Not in the window itself, but in the reflection. In the far corner of the room, behind me—a tall, human-shaped figure. Perfectly still. Head cocked slightly to one side like it was trying to understand me.

My breath caught in my throat like a wire pulled tight.

I turned.

Nothing there.

I whipped back to the window—and it was still there. Same spot. Same tilt of the head.

Watching.

Unmoving.

I lit another red candle. Then another. My hands moved on instinct now—desperation drowning thought. The room bathed in flickering crimson light. Shadows danced madly along the walls.

The figure remained. Still. Patient.

Then—I blinked.

And it was gone.

Just gone.

No sound. No movement. Like it had never been there.

But I knew it had.

My instincts screamed: Get out. Get in the truck. Drive until the sky changes.

But the manual… it said nothing about leaving. Not once.

And suddenly that absence felt deliberate.

Like the rules had never been written for leaving.

Only for surviving until morning.

And morning felt very, very far away.

Then it hit me—Rule #11.

Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.

Simple. Strange. I'd read it like a joke the first time. But now, it loomed in my mind like a warning carved into the walls of a tomb. Something churned in my gut—hunger, maybe. Or dread wearing hunger’s mask.

I moved toward the fridge.

Every part of me screamed don’t, but my hand gripped the handle anyway. It was cold. Damp with condensation.

I opened it.

And found… nothing.

Not empty shelves. Not expired leftovers.

Nothing.

Every item that had been there earlier—gone. Erased. As if they'd never existed.

Except for one thing.

A single, folded note resting where the milk used to be.

I unfolded it slowly, heart pounding like a drumbeat in a funeral march.

“Don’t look at the window again.”

That was it. No explanation. No name. Just that one line, like the fridge itself was whispering.

My hand trembled as I slammed the door shut.

Then—knock knock knock.

Again.

Same rhythm. Same weight.

The sound drilled into me, stripped away whatever calm I had left. My whole body tensed, but this time, instinct didn’t scream. This time, I didn’t freeze.

I glanced at the clock.

1:35 AM.

I blinked.

Wait.

That was past the time window. Rule #1 ended at 1:34 AM.

Technically… I could open the door.

And I did.

Cautiously. Slowly. Holding my breath like it might make a difference.

I opened the door.

And saw nothing.

Just the empty desert, black sky overhead, wind rustling sand like whispers too quiet to understand.

But then—I looked down.

And that’s when my stomach dropped.

A second manual lay on the ground.

Different cover. Thicker.

Stamped in large, blood-red lettering:

“Rules for Eric – Night Two.”

Night two.

There wasn’t supposed to be a night two.

I wasn’t coming back. No one was.

That’s when I realized the truth.

This place—Station 119B—wasn’t a weather station. It never had been. It was a test. A ritual. A trap.

And I wasn’t an employee.

I was a subject. A sacrifice. A participant in something I didn’t understand and could never escape.

Maybe I hadn’t broken Rule #1. Not technically.

But I didn’t care about technicalities anymore.

I was done playing by their rules.

I walked back inside, teeth clenched, and dropped the new manual into the candle flame.

Just like Rule #12 said: If Rule #1 is broken, burn the manual immediately… and pray.

The paper caught instantly. The flame devoured it. Pages curled and blackened, the fire dancing like it had a mind of its own.

Like it was laughing.

I backed away.

That’s when the room changed.

Instantly.

No warning. No flicker. Just gone.

The cot—gone. The fridge—gone. The desk, the equipment, the satellite phone—all erased.

The room had reset.

Same size. Same shape. Same walls.

But stripped bare.

Just me.

The window.

And the candle.

My breath came in shallow gulps.

Then came the tapping.

But this time—it wasn’t on the glass.

It was inside the walls.

Light, skittering taps at first. Then heavier. Then moving.

Circling me.

Like something was crawling through the concrete. Tracing a spiral I couldn’t see. Trapping me in the center.

My mouth opened, but no sound came out.

And then—I remember screaming.

I don’t remember why, exactly.

Only that my voice tore from my throat like it was trying to escape without me. I remember scratching at the door. Fingernails splitting against steel. I remember the candle going out.

And I remember the shadows.

They crawled under my skin.

Not metaphorically. I could feel them. Like black centipedes burrowing through my veins. Eating their way into my thoughts.

Then—

Nothing.

I woke up at dawn.

Face down in the dirt, fifty yards from the station. My clothes damp with dew. My hands shaking.

My car keys clenched tight in one fist.

The manual—gone.

I stumbled back to the building.

The door hung open. No lock. No chain.

Inside?

Empty.

No furniture. No gear. No candles.

Only one thing remained.

A mirror.

Taped to the center of the window.

I walked up to it.

I should’ve turned away.

I should’ve remembered Rule #9.

But I looked.

And what looked back wasn’t me.

It wore my face—but not my eyes.

The eyes were wide. Too wide. Stretched like the skin around them had been peeled back.

They were black, bottomless. Not hollow, but full—of things I couldn’t describe. Things that watched from the other side of glass. Things that waited.

Things that remembered.

Now?

I don’t take jobs anymore. I don’t go outside after dark. I stay indoors. I keep the lights on. I pretend the rules still protect me.

But nights are hard.

Sometimes I hear knocking.

Always three times.

And if the wind ever dies completely…

I stop breathing.

Just in case it's still out there.

Waiting for me to forget the rules.

Even just once.
