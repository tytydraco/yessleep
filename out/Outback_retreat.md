I’d signed up for a retreat in the Australian outback—a self-guided experience designed to help you disconnect from everything. The brochure promised the kind of solitude you couldn’t find anywhere else, a chance to reconnect with yourself through long walks on the trails, journaling by the campfire, and a night under the stars. The retreat center was little more than a cabin with a few supplies stocked—water, non-perishable food, and maps. You were meant to stay out on the trails, only returning to the cabin when you needed to restock. The place was remote, isolated; no guides, no schedules, just you and the wilderness. The idea was to get lost in the land and, in turn, find yourself.

I’d come out here for that very reason. My life had been crumbling for the last few years. A divorce, a dead-end job, and a sense of lost direction had left me exhausted—like a man who had been running a race for too long only to realize he had been headed in the wrong direction the entire time. I thought a retreat like this might help me clear my mind, give me the space to think without the constant pull of responsibilities, of the noise that had drowned out any semblance of peace.

The first few days were peaceful, though unsettling in their quiet. No phones, no distractions—just the vast expanse of desert and bush. I’d grown used to the silence, the way the wind seemed to hum through the trees, and the rustling of unseen creatures in the brush. But by the fourth day, I’d wandered farther than I’d intended. The sun was setting, and I was trying to find a spot to camp when I saw it—a truck parked a few hundred meters off the trail. It was old, the paint chipped and rusted in places, its tires worn from what seemed like years of use.

It didn’t belong out here, not in the wilderness. A truck like that meant the driver wasn’t from the retreat, wasn’t a part of the isolated, self-guided life the center promised. Whoever owned it had to have come in from somewhere far away. I had to admit, I was curious.

I veered off the trail, careful not to make a sound, and moved toward it. That’s when I saw him—a man crouched beside a shallow hole, the fading light of sunset casting long shadows on the dirt. His hands were working in the earth with slow, deliberate motions. He didn’t seem to notice me, but I wasn’t sure if that was because he was too focused on his task or if he simply didn’t care.

“Evening,” I called out, unsure if he would acknowledge me.

He looked up at me, his eyes dark and calm, and nodded. “Evening,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “You out here alone?”

I hesitated. “Yeah. Just on the retreat.”

He didn’t respond immediately, his gaze flicking briefly to my backpack, the map still sticking out of it. “Out here to get away from things?” he asked, almost like he already knew the answer.

I nodded, not wanting to explain too much. “Something like that.”

He offered a small, knowing smile, then gestured to the hole he was digging. “You ever stop and think about what’s out here, under the earth? What’s buried? It’s all got its place. Just like us. All of us out here, trying to make sense of things.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that. Something about the way he said it made it sound like he wasn’t talking just about the dirt. My eyes flicked to the tarp he was folding beside the hole. It was large, heavy, and whatever was wrapped in it seemed to have a strange weight to it.

“What’s in the tarp?” I asked, my curiosity getting the better of me.

The man didn’t look at it, didn’t seem bothered by the question. He simply gave a small shrug, a vague gesture. “Something that’s better left buried. Some things out here, they don’t belong above ground.”

I wasn’t sure if that was a cryptic answer or just the ramblings of a man who’d spent too much time in the wilderness. But I couldn’t help but glance at the truck again, its faded red paint standing out against the brush. He hadn’t come from the retreat—he was out here on his own, far from anything resembling the cabin or the trails.

“How long have you been out here?” I asked, still trying to piece together who this man was.

“A while,” he said simply. “Not a lot of folks around these parts. I like it that way.”

I looked down at the hole again. It was shallow, hastily dug, but it was clear he’d been working at it for some time. There was a strange calmness in his demeanor that made me uneasy.

“You know,” he said, his voice almost a whisper, “the land can teach you things. Things you can’t learn by sitting inside. The snakes, the buzzards, even the dirt—it all tells a story, if you know how to listen.”

“Buzzards?” I asked, unsure where he was going with this.

He nodded, his eyes tracking the circling shadows overhead. “They’re not just scavengers. They clean up what’s already been killed. They don’t take anything they don’t need. Same with the snakes. Especially the king browns. They’re dangerous, sure. But they’re also purposeful. They kill what’s necessary. They don’t waste. The land… it works like that.”

His words hung in the air, unsettling and cryptic. “What do you mean by ‘necessary’?” I asked, trying to push past my unease.

He met my gaze, his expression unreadable. “Some things are meant to die. Others are meant to survive.”

There was something about the way he said it that left me feeling like I had just stumbled into something I wasn’t meant to understand. The wind shifted, and I glanced at the horizon, where the last rays of the sun were fading into darkness.

“I should probably get going,” I said, trying to mask the discomfort in my voice. I wasn’t sure what was happening here, but it was starting to feel more like an encounter I was meant to walk away from than one I should stay for.

The man gave a small nod, then slowly packed up the tarp, leaving it in place beside the hole. Without a word, he turned to his truck. I watched him load several tools—old, well-used, and caked in dirt—into the back of the vehicle. A shovel. A small pickaxe. A coil of rope. As he shut the tailgate, his eyes met mine one last time.

“Take care of yourself out here,” he said, his tone still calm, but there was a quiet finality to it. “Not everything you bury stays buried.”

I watched as he climbed into the truck, started the engine, and drove off into the distance, the old vehicle kicking up a cloud of dust that clung to the air long after the sound of the engine had faded.

The next morning, I went back to the spot where I’d met him. The hole was filled in, the tarp still lying there untouched. No sign of the man. No sign of the truck. It was as if they had never been there at all.

When I asked the retreat staff about the man or the truck, they didn’t know what I was talking about. They said there was no one out there but the retreat guests and a few park rangers from a nearby station. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the man was part of the land—just as much a presence in that desolate place as the snakes, the buzzards, or the wind.

If anyone knows anything about a man like that—someone who spends time alone out here, buried in the dust and the silence—please let me know. I don’t think I’ll be going back to that part of the outback again, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not the first one to have crossed paths with him. 

A few days after my encounter with the strange man, I returned to the cabin for a resupply. The retreat was self-guided and isolated—designed for introspection, with the cabin serving as a stopover point between hikes. It wasn’t meant to be a place to stay overnight unless there was an emergency. The idea was to rest, stock up on supplies, and continue the journey. I hadn’t planned to spend much time there. But as the sun dipped lower and the shadows stretched long across the land, I found myself making my way back, not thinking much of it.

When I got close, though, something felt wrong.

The first thing that caught my attention was the door. It was locked, as it should have been, but the wood was marked—dented and pushed in around the edges, like something had tried to force its way through. I didn’t linger there, but it made me pause, uncertain. The cabin was supposed to be secure. It was supposed to be empty.

The second thing I noticed was the window. It had been broken. The glass was no longer scattered across the floor, as you’d expect. Instead, it was pushed all into the corner of the room, as if something—or whatever—had taken care to shove the shards out of the way. The window frame itself was undisturbed, but the glass… that wasn’t how it should’ve been.

I stood outside for a moment, wondering if I should enter. It was quiet. Too quiet. But I convinced myself to check the inside, figuring maybe there was a simple explanation. Whatever had been in there was long gone now.

As I stepped through the door, I saw that things had been moved. The cot, which I knew was always tucked away in the back room, had been pulled out and placed in the center of the floor. It wasn’t just moved; it was as though something had put it there with some care, but no particular intention. The mattress was still there, flat and unused, but it was clear something had been through.

What really stopped me in my tracks were the scattered remnants around the room—old, unidentifiable clumps of hair. It was just there, scattered in different parts of the room, deteriorating as if it had been left for a long time.

I didn’t stay long enough to look more closely. What struck me more than the disarray was the careful attempt to fix the window. Whatever had been inside had gathered rocks and sticks, placing them in the broken seal with some effort, trying to block the hole and keep the elements out. The care taken with it was unsettling, like whatever had done it still had some semblance of purpose.

It didn’t make sense for me to have walked into a cabin with something unknown lingering inside. Whatever had happened, whatever had been there, was gone. The place felt abandoned in its own way, like it had been a long time since anything had touched it.

I left quickly after that. The retreat staff, when I reported what I’d found, seemed unsurprised. Claire, the manager, promised they’d look into it. But there was something about the way she said it that felt… off. As if this was not the first time something strange had been reported. I didn’t push for details. I wasn’t sure I wanted any.

The retreat isn’t a large place, and the cabin is a simple one, really. The guests are given keys to the cabin, and the staff has them too. We’re all expected to use it only for supplies, a brief stop to replenish before heading back out into the wilderness. It was meant to be a solitary experience, one of self-reflection, with as little interference as possible. But whatever had been in there… it felt like it shouldn’t have been. I wasn’t supposed to encounter anything like that.

I stayed out in the bush that night, setting up camp under the wide open sky, trying to shake the feeling that the land itself was holding something back. But there wasn’t much point in staying longer. The cabin wasn’t a place to rest for me anymore.

I left the next day, continuing my walk back to where I’d come from. The outback stretched out in every direction, quiet and unyielding. I didn’t look back.

Now, I’ve returned home. The memories from the retreat linger in my thoughts, unsettling and fragmentary. I haven’t been able to make sense of what happened. There’s no clear explanation, nothing I can hold onto. It’s just an impression, a feeling that whatever had been out there wasn’t finished with me.

But maybe I’ll go back one day. Maybe not. There’s still something about that place, something that’s hard to shake. If anyone else has spent time on this retreat, or if you’ve experienced something strange out there, I’d be interested to hear. Maybe there’s something I missed, or something that connects what happened. Maybe it’s better not to know.

For now, though, I think I’ve gotten my fill of the outback. At least for a while.
