Characters:

Barkeep (A 32-year-old man)

Man at Bar (A man in his mid 20’s)

 

 

Setting:

The scene takes place at a local bar called Les Terrains Hantés.

A man has been sitting at the bar all night and continuously asking for another round. The bartender is a quiet fellow with a calm and comforting demeanor, yet still carries authority. People listen to the bartender when he has something to say, which isn’t often. The man is obviously very drunk and is at his wits end. He is very apathetic and often finds himself lost in thought.

 

At Rise:

The man is hunched over at a bar. The barkeep is cleaning a glass with a rag in typical barkeep fashion. The man is dressed in sweatpants and a hoodie while the bartender is in a suit, but without a coat. He has dress pants and a dress shirt with a tie and a vest.

 

 

**The Man**: \[*lifts his hand slightly*\] Another round.

**Barkeep**: Yeah. \[*turns around and begins pouring the drink and takes a slight pause*\] You sure you need it?

**The man**: \[*looks up and glares*\] Just pour the fuckin drink.

**Barkeep**: \[*leans over the bar*\] You know, I don’t typically talk to my clientele, but you’ve been here a while man. \[*pauses a moment to look at the man sitting at the bar*\] Are you sure you need it?

**The Man**: Pour. The fuckin. Drink. \[*clenches his jaw and swallows*\]

**Barkeep**: Alright. \[*finishes pouring the drink*\] You gotta name?

**The Man**: Not one I care to share.

**Barkeep**: What happened?

**The Man**: Excuse me?

**Barkeep**: \[*points at the door*\] People don’t just come in here by themselves and drink all night unless something’s happened.

**The Man**: Well, I am not “people”. Just let me fuckin drink.

**Barkeep**: You get fired? Boss let you go? You in an abusive relationship?

**The Man**: \[*looks at the barkeep and lets out a slight chuckle*\] Nah.

**Barkeep**: Did you get dumped? Girl broke your heart, you catch her cheatin?

**The Man**: She died.

**Barkeep**: \[*a heaviness fills the room as the barkeep tries to be respectful*\] Oh. \[*he pauses a moment*\] I’m sorry, you have my condolences.

**The Man**: Fuck off. I have everyone’s condolences, none of it matters.

**Barkeep**: When did it happen?

**The Man**: This morning. \[*begins to tear up*\] This time last night I was… I was holding her, in my arms, in our home.

**Barkeep**: I’m sorry.

**The Man**: Are ya? \[*the disdain and sarcasm are evident in the man’s tone*\] I’m glad. I’m glad you’re sorry, it makes me feel a lot better. \[*tears begin rolling down the man’s face, but he does not blink, and a scowl is all that can be seen*\]

**Barkeep**: How’d it happen? If you don’t mind my asking.

**The Man**: Suicide. \[The man thinks for a moment\] Well, in a way. I guess you could say she killed herself but it wasn’t on purpose. Unintentional fucking suicide, if that even exists. \[*he lets out a suppressed laugh*\] That’s the bullshit the cops wrote down.

**Barkeep**: What does that even mean? \[*gives an inquisitive look at the man*\] How does… How does that happen?

**The Man**: I was there. It was this morning. That was today. \[*he stares into the table, completely lost*\] We woke up and she was in the mood. Sometimes, she liked to experiment. She was kind of into that sort of thing.

**Barkeep**: Hold on, experiment? What do you mean? She was like, kinky?

**The Man**: She liked… Wax and, ya know like, whips and playful stuff. \[*he looks very uncomfortable*\] I never liked it, I… It always bothered me and… I don’t know. She liked playing with razors too.

**Barkeep**: Jesus Christ man.

**The Man**: Eventually, she kept wanting to do a little more and a little more and a little more. \[*he looks down and rubs his hands, a sign of discomfort. An inability to cope*\] She bought some fake pistols and BB guns and… You get the idea. One day, she bought a real one and we would mess around and use it sometimes. I mean SOME times. She knew I didn’t like it, but she was able to convince me every now and then.

**Barkeep**: Shit, no way it was loaded?

**The Man**: No! God, fuck no… At least, not usually. One night, about a month ago… She loaded it. It was a little Kimber K6S. \[*he shrugs*\] That’s a six-chamber revolver. \[*his breathing begins shaking*\] She just put one round in… But she didn’t tell me. She was messing with it and put it to her chin. She pulled the trigger and it clicked. The chamber rotated and I saw the bullet casing from the back.

**Barkeep**: Oh my god.

**The Man**: I didn’t handle it well. Saying we got in an argument would be an understatement. We were at each other’s throats, not in a hot way, it was… It was terrifying. I was almost ready to kill her myself. I didn’t know what to do, like… What’s goin on in my wife’s head? \[*he stares into nothing for a time and then snaps out of it\]* We went to counseling for a couple weeks, but… She didn’t wanna keep going cuz she felt like a freak. Like, people were judging her. We stopped goin. \[*pulls out an identical K6S from under the table*\] This morning…

**Barkeep**: \[*sees the gun*\] Woah, shit man! Wha… What are you doing!?

**The Man**: She pulled the trigger, but this time… She wasn’t so lucky. Makes ya wonder huh? Who people really are. My wife is dead, just because she wanted to get off on some fucking thrill. \[continues to play with the firearm that he is holding while his face slowly hardens\]

**Barkeep**: \[*senses the tension in the air and quickly triggers the silent alarm located underneath the bar to call the police*\] Hey man, ca… calm down alright? It’s gonna be ok, everything’s gonna be fine.

**The Man**: Is it? Is it all fine? Everything’s fine? \[*begins to get heated and raise his voice*\] Everything’s just fucking dandy isn’t it!? It’s all just sunshine and rainbows for you! You don’t know! You don’t have any idea that everything’s just fuckin fine! No one does… I am alone… Utterly alone. A man who has lost the only thing he has ever loved or cared about. \[*begins to laugh psychotically*\] And the worst part is… I couldn’t hardly recognize her when she was gone. Who is this woman I’m living with? This twisted monster who gets off from fucking shooting herself in the head!!!

**Barkeep**: I need you to calm down, you’re scaring me. Look, I know you’re hurting… Trust me… My mom died when I was seventeen, so I know… I know what it means to lose someone, really lose someone. It’s hard, but we have to keep going. There are so many people, who care about you. People who want to see you and know that you’re OK.

**The Man**: Yeah, well… I don’t really want to see them. I’m sorry to hear about your mom, that sucks. \[*he once again picks up the K6S and begins to spin the chamber and play with the safety. He looks at it with intense desire*\]

**Barkeep**: Hey… Hey man, what are you… What are you doing? Hey!

**The Man**: \[*loads the chamber with a single bullet and spins it like an old western. He flicks the chamber into place and cocks the trigger. He holds the gun to the side of his head, click*…\]

**Barkeep**: Hey… Hey!

**The Man**: She was right… \[*He pulls the trigger again, click*…\] 

**Barkeep**: Hey come on man, stop!

**The Man**: This is kind of fun. \[*he pulls the trigger again, click*…\] How ‘bout another round? \[*bang…*\]
