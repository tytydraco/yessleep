I am stuck here, I can't take my eyes off this mirror. I am getting more and more tired over time. **Help me** 

My name is Mark. I am a non married single man.  I work as a boring masonry worker in central Texas. I woke up around 6 am. It was a Monday, As this morning came, I heard my annoying alarm and got up as I usually do. I put on my clothes, have breakfast, brush my teeth then I am ready for work. But this morning was different than the others. I woke up to a strange tingly and cold feeling all around my spine, it was extremely unnerving and uncomfortable.

I decided I was going to ignore it but it kept getting worse. But not just getting worse overtime, it was getting worse specifically, specifically when I was going closer to my bedroom mirror. I was trying my best to ignore it but it was quite difficult. After I changed I left the room and went downstairs, the pain stopped. My daily breakfast choice is usually a bowl of blueberry oatmeal. So I made that and sat down. After breakfast I brushed my teeth straight away. Work started at around 7:00 in the morning. it was 6:15. And I lived around 30 minutes away from work.

As I entered the bathroom I suddenly had this horrific pain in my spine and jolted forward. It was awful. The pain was incredible, and felt like 1000 bees were stinging me at the same time. I know it is gross but I decided to skip brushing my teeth due to the awful. I opened the door to my old rusty nissan. I was living on a low budget. Then I drove off to work.

When I arrived I got out the car to walk to the new area we were trying to finish off building, it was a house someone wanted to be built, nothing interesting really. I arrived and got to work with a couple other friends on the job. Something smelt... Odd. No it wasn't the cement or the bricks we were laying. It was something odd. Something you wouldn't be smelling as a masonry worker. It smelt like something was rotting in the air. I asked one of my friends Matthew but he couldn't smell anything, neither the others.

Work finished and I was kind of concerned, the morning and now this? I felt like a something was particularly staring at me on the way home.  I got home and decided I was just going to go straight to bed due to the quite strange day I just had. But before I went to sleep I saw this... Creature, this... Thing. It was extremely skinny, it had no eyes and was around 8 feet tall. I had a shiver go down my whole body. I didn't believe in ghosts, nor this. I was petrified. It was leaning over me, and all I could hear was it's loud breathing. I closed my eyes, praying for it to go away, so I could way up to the morning and not have to worry about this anymore.

I opened my eyes, it was the morning. I felt like I was hungover but from what I remember I didn't drink anything the night before. I was still concerned about the night before. I looked at my alarm. 4:36 pm. WHAT! I had over slept. I must have done. This was a disaster, I can't go to work now. I will be told off!

I decided I would stay in that night. And come up with some pathetic excuse. I still was sitting in my bed. It was 5:40. Time moved so fast! It was dark outside now. I got up and quickly turned to face my mirror... There it was. The thing. But it was in the mirror. I looked back quickly then turned my head back again to face the mirror. Shit, it was closer. I didn't know what to do. I was stuck here. I felt thousands of chills running down my spine, and that pain started to go down my spine again. I felt like I couldn't breath. It was getting worse and worse each second. I knew that if I turned away it would start getting closer to me. **I** am stuck. **Help me**
