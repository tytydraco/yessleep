Ryan and I met as roomies at my hometown’s college. We shared a love for gaming and built our dorm’s “gaming nights'' which continued long after we left. We became famous as Team Scryan  (“Team Scryan, yeah that’s right, I’m Scott, he’s Ryan,” that sounded a lot better in college). When we got our degrees, we each joined our family’s business which meant Ryan went back to his hometown. We kept up with our gaming nights

I was intrigued when Ryan invited me to work with him at Saint Warren's, his family's lighthouse. He felt the lighthouse was an easy and interesting way to make money, something I could do "on the side." It wouldn't conflict with my position back home. Dad gave me some time off with pay to see what Ryan had in mind. 

While white-knuckling the flight to Ryan’s in a rickety ol' six-seater, I read up on new uses for old lighthouses. I had ideas and questions and was ready to go when the flight ended.

Ryan was supposed to meet me at the airport and the airport isn’t much bigger than my garden shed so there’s no way I could have missed him. He hadn’t called or texted, and didn’t reply to any from me, but that’s Ryan for ya.

When I got outside I stepped into the worst fog I’ve ever seen! I put my arm out and could barely see my hand. I felt bad for thinking Ryan might have stood me up. He wasn’t the best driver so he was probably hoping I’d find a way to his place and not mention the weather.

Big shock to no one, the town didn’t have Uber. Which left what, walking? Google Maps showed his place was a 10 minute walk from the airport. Good thing I only had a sports bag with my change of clothes. I’m a gamer, not a hiker.

My mood got worse when Ryan didn’t answer the door. There was no car in the driveway and no note on the door. Did he forget? Did he change his mind? I was tired of the fog and of walking and wanted to sit. 

Expecting to be further frustrated, I tried the door handle – and it opened. Do people in small towns not lock their doors? Of course, this was Ryan and he wasn’t the type to sweat small stuff like theft or people walking in unannounced. So I hurried in and left the door closed but unlocked. 

The house was deathly quiet. No one was inside and no lights were on. The only sign that anyone had been around was a crumpled note on the floor a few feet from the door. In Ryan’s handwriting it said “'clean up lighthouse, Scott put “haunted” rumors on tiktok and x”. It sounded good to me. Getting the word out that you could get a tour of a haunted lighthouse? Brilliant. People love haunted houses. A haunted lighthouse would be extra unique, extra creepy. We could make a fortune off this!

I checked the living room bookshelves for the family records from Ryan's grandfather. His great-granddad built the lighthouse and kept careful records for years. His grandfather kept up with the records and entrusted the books to Ryan. Ryan had told me of the books a few times back in college. And there they were, on the middle shelf, separated from everything else by a set of carved eagle bookends. 

The books were old, some much older than others. I grabbed the one at the left end and got comfy in the rocking chair by the window. The curtains were closed but there was enough light in the room for me. The sofa was closer to the bookshelves but had a lot of pillows which creeped me out. Besides, who doesn’t love a big ol’ wooden rocking chair. When no one else can see you in it. Sitting by the window meant I would hear Ryan pulling into the driveway and be able to return the book and be standing when he got in.

So the lighthouse was named “Saint Warren” after an incident with the first and only lighthouse keeper, Warren. It all started with Harold Davis, Ryan’s great grandfather. In the 1930s and 40s, he owned the town's only construction company. Sometime in 1940 or 1941, he won a plot of land close to the river in a game of euchre. First thing he did was see how he could benefit from the land. The town didn’t impose land tax on property “whose primary purpose is the safety of our residents.”  What safety building did the town not have? A lighthouse! So Harold hired local teens to build the first and only local lighthouse. It opened in 1942. He made sure everyone knew it was to protect them from communism. 

He hired Warren Flynn, brother of the town’s Pastor and the only unemployed man in town, as lighthouse keeper. Warren moved in and turned out to be not too bad as a lighthouse keeper. 

Then the war ended. 

By late ‘46 everyone felt safe and wanted to go back to the way things were. Except Warren, who refused to vacate his position. He spent the last few months of his life proclaiming daily from the top of the lighthouse that he would be sainted after death.

Harold found Warren’s body at the top of the lighthouse on October 29, 1946. Doc Brainerd, the town’s most beloved physician, concluded Warren died of a heart attack. Pastor Flynn spent 24 hours considering his brother’s request for sainthood. He turned it down which meant the request couldn't go any further.

The church has a record of a funeral during a thunderstorm on the night of October 30, 1946. Next to the lighthouse, there’s a tombstone with Warren Flynn’s name and birth and death date on it. But as early as Hallowe’en 1946, townspeople questioned the true destination of Warren’s remains. 

The book had captured my interest so strongly I didn’t hear someone approaching the house until the front door slammed. I jumped to my feet and held the book tightly, ready to use it as a weapon. 

“Scott?”

A chill went down my spine. The voice was unfamiliar. It sounded masculine, gravelly, the voice of someone who doesn’t speak often. 

And it knew my name.

“Who– who’s there?” 

A tall figure in a beige overcoat and jeans appeared at the doorway to the living room.  “Ryan got called away on an emergency. Passing on his apologies. I’m Uncle Joe. I’ll stay for a while.”

Joe sat on the sofa, somehow avoiding all the pillows. Grey hair, a few lines on his tanned face, he carried  himself with the air of someone who didn’t look for trouble but wouldn’t let trouble get out of hand. Even in the light of the room it was hard to tell his age. Older than 40, younger than 70? He didn’t exactly smile but he didn’t look angry or sad. My best guess was acceptance – of me being there, of Ryan being caught in an emergency, and of Joe not explaining himself any further.

“Huh. Well. Good to meet you, Joe.” I extended my hand and quickly withdrew it. He didn’t seem concerned about social niceties.

“Good book,” he said, nodding at me.

I sat, since it didn’t appear he was going to throw me out or leave. “You’ve heard about the lighthouse?”

Joe laughed. “Lived here all my life. Since the early days.” He looked over his shoulder, like he was pretending to look out the window. “A lot of death with Saint Warren.”

It was my turn to be silent. I raised an eyebrow but couldn’t find words to indicate I wanted to know more about the deaths. Some part of me didn’t want to know, I guess. A cool breeze hit my neck and I realized why Joe was looking at the window. It seemed closed but there was no other place the wind could be entering the room. Maybe I’d check that, see if there was something I could fix, so Ryan didn’t have to worry about it when he got back.

“The year after Warren died, Doc Brainerd, the mayor and the Rockwell Sisters died.” 

My other eyebrow raised.

“The Sisters. Maybe you didn’t get to that part yet.” He smiled briefly as if the memories comforted him. “Old Lady Dixie and Old Lady Prudence Rockwell. They insisted the town started turning into Hell on Earth when women started wearing nylon stockings after ‘the war’. They meant World War I.”

I shivered. “Is that window–”

Joe checked his wrist watch before continuing. “Window’s fine. Every year after that, at least four residents died. Always the old ones.” He smiled again, a little more intensely. “That’s how it was then. Not now of course. Balance is required. That’s why Ryan’s idea is so good.”

Goosebumps covered my arms and I was physically uncomfortable. 

“I’m going to get a hoodie,” I announced, pointing towards the hall behind me. It would have carried more weight if I’d been able to move. Instead I found myself stuck to the rocking chair. My stomach clenched and my breathing slowed.

“Won’t be long,” Joe said, sticking his hands into his coat pockets. He moved them about like he was looking for something. “Ryan must proceed with his plan.”

“Sure, just let me get–” I twisted my hips, trying to disengage from the chair. Nothing worked. I swear I could hear my heart beating and it was slowing down which didn’t seem right at all.

Joe removed his hands from the pockets and unfolded a crumpled note. He stared at it and continued speaking. “The plan. That’s where you come in.”

“Joe.”  My voice sounded reedy, like a little kid’s. He didn’t reply or even look up from the note. “Joe, a question.”

He looked up. “Yes?”

“What should concern me more, that I can’t get out of the chair, or the temperature drop, or how I fit into Ryan’s plans?”

He stood without disturbing a single pillow and took two steps towards me while holding out the unfolded note. All I wanted to do was run. I didn't even try to take the note.

“I said I’d stay a while,” Joe said softly. “We have to leave soon. I’ll read you the note. It’s addressed to Ryan. Maritime Airlines regrets to inform you Flight #94 from Franklin crashed at 3:14 p.m. today. There were no survivors, all bodies have been accounted for. You were one of two emergency contacts our passenger Scott Ardenstahl provided. We deeply regret this news and offer our sincere condolences.”

I was shaking and it was clearly not due to the house temperature. “This can’t be, no…”

“We’re going to the lighthouse. I’ll be your mentor. You’ll know all the tricks by the time Ryan gets back from your funeral. It’ll be a real treat for him. You can now rise from the chair.”

I rose with ease. No breathing, no heartbeat. Weightless. 

“Let’s go,” Joe said, rising from the floor. ”And leave your phone, you don’t need it anymore.”
