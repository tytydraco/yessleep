I walked into the smokey bar about a quarter past three on a Wednesday afternoon. I’ve been playing this game with myself recently where I’m allowed to drink and smoke as much as I’d like as long as I have my laptop plugged in and I get some writing or research done. After all, the greats that had inspired me to be a writer are well known for using their vices to unlock their brilliant minds. I’m thinking of Steven King, Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Burns… fuck it you know that the most famous of Greek tragedies were not written by a sober man. 

I’d like to say that I do spend most of that time writing, but after the words on my google document start to blur I switch to research, studying the characters that surround me. The bartender - a functional alcoholic who’s overworked and underpaid, the other patrons whose alcoholism ranges from the very high functioning to not functioning at all, and - perhaps the most interesting to me - the musicians. 

This is a small bar in Woodside Queens, New York City. None of the musicians that play in this bar are fulfilling their goals of “making it” in the greatest city in the world; and you can tell which of them is a transplant here to follow a dream and those that have grown up here and know what kind of gig this is. This is the kind of gig where you’re paid peanuts, the crowd is more absorbed in their shitty beers than your solo, and the only person who will discover you by the end of the night is an absolutely sloshed and lonely blonde that has a thing for bass players. 

Tonight, however, as I finished my fourth dirty martini and the Arial type on my screen began to blur, I noticed a new member of the regular Wednesday night band. 

He’d showed up late, overdressed in a white button up shirt and silk, black suit. There had been some furious whispering between him and the band leader, but it seemed resolved once he pulled his fiddle from his case, shining with polish and obviously very well cared for even to someone who didn’t know a damn thing about the instrument. I missed most of the conversation but I did catch the welldressed man’s hiss-

“I’m here to work.”

I decided to order another martini and watch this character as he was so much more interesting than the usual bar crowd that I dutifully studied for the sake of drinking. He played well but lacklusterly for the first 45 minutes of the set, and the band was mostly ignored. The band broke for a “piss and a smoke” and most of the patrons followed them out to do the same. I didn’t register that I was alone with the fiddler until he sat next to me in my booth, breaking my gin induced reverie.

“Hello darling.” He said, and I turned my head to see him sat very close, his warm knee touching mine. Usually that would piss right the fuck off but when I looked at his face I noticed he was very attractive. I couldn’t describe his features to you now, but in the moment he was handsome and strangely disarming. When I didn’t respond he continued- “What’s a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?” Again, I should have been angry and insulted but I simply could not in that moment find the indignant rage that usually was so close to the surface. 

“I’m doing research.” I giggled. I pointed to the document still open on my laptop where my notes on everyone in the bar still shone in blinding blue light. He looked at the screen and even scrolled to the very top of the document, capturing it all. 

“I’m not in here.” He seemed genuinely confused as he said this, searching my eyes. For a moment his spell on me seemed to break, and I shrank away, placing space between us. 

“I-I’m still watching.” I stammered. “You only came tonight. I’ll watch and write later.” He cracked a huge smile at this, the kind of smile that can even light up a pub on the corner under a train that runs constantly overhead. I moved back into place, my thigh grazing his again and burning with the contact. 

“Pretty girl,” he said and I melted into his side even though he smoldered “will you stay for the rest of the show?” I nodded numbly and he stood as the band returned to the stage and the patrons returned from their cigarettes. 

This time, however, he did not play on the sidelines. He pushed his way to the front of the stage and raised his shining fiddle. He played a jig, despite the protests of the rest of the band. I thought it fitting; I was not the only redhead in this pub who might enjoy a return to our roots. I was completely absorbed by the melody until I noticed that everyone else was, too. I receded to the corner of my booth and watched as all the patrons, then the band, then the bartender began to dance. I wanted to dance, too, but something in the fiddler’s wild eyes when he glanced at me told me to stay put. 

So I sat while everyone danced. And danced. And danced. They danced furiously, swinging their arms and not caring who they hit or if they got hit. I began to observe bleeding noses, a few people had pissed themselves, and a woman tripped over a chair clearly breaking her leg yet she got up and danced still, blood soaking through her jeans. A man climbed on a table, jumping and landing wrong, doing his best to sit up and flail wildly despite his legs not moving accordingly. They danced as they broke themselves and each other, and I sat in my booth with the fiddler’s eyes whispering to me both sweet nothings and also nothing at all. 

Eventually, though it felt a much longer time than it was, everyone who had been in the bar lay on the floor either still or dragging themselves along by table legs and chairs. The suited man placed his fiddle lovingly in its case and escorted me to the door.

“Et spero et non spero nos iterum convenire” he whispered, as he kissed my hand.

I woke up in my apartment three blocks away with a bandaged hand and a horrible hangover. I unwrapped the bandage to find a blistering burn, vaguely aware of sirens in the background.

The pub had burned to ashes in the night, apparently. 

As I stood in the street, surrounded by the ever familiar sound of sirens and smell of smoke I wondered why I had been spared. I wondered if I should finally stop using writing as an excuse to drink but then I thought- I do quite like the music. And I’d like to meet that character again.
