I vividly remember the morning after the full moon of September seventh. I woke up on the floor with a horrible taste in my mouth. My joints were stiff, my cheek was stuck to the floorboards with crusted stains, and my hair was matted with sweat.

At least, I thought it was sweat at first. I remember lying there with my eyes squeezed shut, trying to recount the events of last night beyond the pounding music, the haze of pot-smoke, and the horde of sorority girls someone managed to invite into the house.

I reached down and patted at my belt to make sure my pants were accounted for. My skin and clothes felt sticky and damp.

*Damn, this better not be vomit.*

I groaned, slowly pushed myself through the dull headache into a sitting position, and opened my eyes.

At first, my muddled mind couldn’t make out what I was seeing. Crimson and black shapes and long shadows accompanied a strange sickening scent. Slowly, in the hazy gray sunlight filtering through the curtains, the shapes came into focus.

I felt the blood drain from my face.

Strewn all across the halls and floors of Keith Landore’s house were bodies. They were all silent, which was the worst part, because when you see that much blood on the floor, you expect the people in it to be screaming their heads off as proof that they’re still alive. Yet they didn’t make a sound. Limbs twisted and faces distorted into strange wide-eyed expressions. Everything covered in blood and pink viscera.

“What the fuck,” I muttered. My voice was hoarse, like I had been screaming all night. “What-”

My eyes flicked to the couch. Keith was spread out over the cushions. Head here. Leg there. Stomach spilled over the armrest.

“K-*Keith?*”

Bile bubbled up from my stomach and filled my throat. I stumbled to my feet and staggered from the room. Down the hall, to the stairs, refusing to look down at what I was stepping in. I tripped over a body painted down the steps. Was it Ron Trenton? Or Cody Poway? There were more bodies downstairs. Four, five of them. The house reeked of everything foul and sickening. My head felt like it was splitting open. My feet slipped on slick cold gore.

My phone. It was on the floor of the master bedroom, discarded among arms and legs and torn-up insides. I grabbed it with shaking hands and dialed.

As I stared down at the numbers *911*, I realized my hands were covered in dried blood, thick red stuff caked underneath my fingernails. I stared down at them.

In the deathly silence, I heard a soft shuffling. My head snapped toward it, desperate.

*Thank god, someone’s alive.*

I stumbled to the closet and threw open the doors.

“*N-no!*”

I stared down at the kid cramped underneath the hangers. He cowered, arms clasped over his face. Blood soaked the front of his ill-fitting T-shirt.

“*Fuck*, are you okay?” I breathed. “Are you hurt? What happened?”

He lowered his arms a fraction of an inch. His eyes were wide with terror, and his mouth hung crooked, blood dribbling down a viciously torn left cheek. His gaze flickered uncertainly. Then he gripped the floor and pressed himself against the back wall of the closet.

“Please, don’t hurt me.”

“What? I’m not gonna hurt you. I-”

“You… you killed them.”

I stiffened.

“What?”

“You killed them. You…”

He shuddered, then finally raised his head and locked eyes with me.

“You’re the wolf that killed everyone last night.”

==========

I only vaguely recognized Griffin Morrison. He was an awkwardly quiet kid, one of Keith’s high school friends or something, and I couldn’t remember much about why he had been invited to the party except maybe Keith told us he knew how to DJ or something. He was rail-thin with messy black hair and pierced ears, and on that morning, he rambled to me about *lycanthropy*.

“You’ve got to be shitting me,” I cried. “People are *dead*. We gotta call the cops!”

“Listen to me!” Griffin pleaded. His words were garbled and strained with pain from the gaping wound in his cheek, but still he pushed them out, frantic.

“The police can’t know about your condition. They’re going to lock you up!”

“You think this is a joke? I’m not a fucking *werewolf*!”

“I’m dead serious,” he said. “This isn’t the first time I’ve encountered lycanthropy. If you think I’m making this up, look at those tracks again and tell me what they are.”

I swallowed. I didn’t want to look at the floors of Keith’s house any longer, and even if I did, there was no denying what Griffin had pointed out to me. Mixed in with splatters and stains, underneath soiled sheets and broken glassware, they were everywhere. Paw prints.

“You don’t remember anything from last night, do you? Not after moonrise.”

“I just had too much to drink!”

“And the blood on your hands?”

“I…”

Griffin reached up and touched his cheek, the shredded skin where I could see his tongue painstakingly form his words.

“When they find my DNA under your fingernails, would you believe me then?”

I was shaking. Part of me kept waiting for him to laugh, like this was all a sick joke he was making. But he remained wide-eyed and silent.

I looked down at my blood-encrusted hands.

I couldn’t breathe. This was insanity. Griffin Morrison was obviously a weirdo and he was making this all up. This had to be some sort of fucked-up accident. Keith, my friends, their friends, even those sorority girls…

I shuddered as Griffin put a hand on my shoulder.

“Listen to me, okay? Let’s get you clean, and then we need to talk to the cops. If we just be careful, you’ll be okay. They won’t know.”

I looked up at him. He made a feeble attempt at a smile, even as his torn cheek trembled.

==========

Griffin was right. The cops never figured it out.

They found overwhelming evidence of a wild animal attack. Paw prints, claw marks, fur and saliva with canine DNA. Autopsies revealed that all wounds on the bodies were inflicted with sharp teeth and claws. At first they blamed a pack of wolves that was known to hunt in the nearby wildlife reserve, but some biologist argued that the species didn’t match up. Another claimed DNA analysis was inconclusive, that it might not be a wolf at all. Media coverage slowed to a drawling academic debate.

“You’re fucked,” I spat. “Something’s seriously wrong with you. How do you look at that and think *werewolf*?”

“Because I *saw* you,” Griffin said quietly.

We sat by the empty football field as the sky darkened to dusk. I had made a habit of meeting Griffin here.

“You’re making shit up!” I cried. My voice broke. It felt like the hundredth time saying this. “Werewolves aren’t *real*! They’re fantasy things. Next thing, you’ll be telling me there’s a unicorn up in the hill country!”

“Unicorns aren’t real,” Griffin said matter-of-factly.

I stared at him, mouth agape, wondering if he was listening to himself. He just stared back at me. His doctors had put his dislocated jaw back in place and stitched up his cheek, leaving a jagged white scar that tightened when he spoke.

“Lycanthropy exists. I know because I’ve seen it. Not just you. There are… *many* people who have the condition.”

“*I don’t-*”

“You do. Look at me, Darron.”

He hadn’t even known my name before it was in the news. Griffin Morrison and Darron Bell, lucky survivors of the house party slaughter. I had been passed out drunk, fortuitously obscured behind a couch. Griffin had hidden into the closet.

“You can call me crazy all you want, but we *need* to make sure we’re ready, next month when the full moon comes again. We have to make sure nothing like this *ever* happens again.”

I stared at him. He hugged himself with his scarecrow arms.

“Trust me,” he pleaded, almost choking on his words. “If only on the night of the next full moon, *please*, believe me.”

I realized then that the resolve in his eyes barely held back his fear. He was shaking. Terrified.

I inched away from him, in some feeble attempt to give him space. He averted his gaze. We sat in silence as the last light of sunset faded.

Finally, I found my words.

“Why are you helping me?”

Griffin swallowed. His expression turned dark, unreadable.

“I told you. This isn’t the first time I’ve encountered a werewolf.”

“Who else have you seen? What happened?”

He looked away.

“It’s getting cold,” he said. “We should get inside.”

==========

The next full moon was on October seventh. Griffin made sure to let me know. I counted the days with a sickening anticipation, checking my calendar a dozen times every day.

When the seventh finally came, I was ready.

I drove Griffin in my parents’ old Subaru to the spot that I had picked out. A long-abandoned barnhouse, almost an hour away from town in the middle of overgrown fields. I had spent many days in high school smoking with my friends here, hidden away from our parents and teachers.

Griffin quietly helped me unload. We hadn’t talked much on the drive, both of us nervous and tired of waiting. He handed me a flashlight, and heaved the massive coils of rope I had bought.

“It’s heavy,” he gasped. “You really didn’t have to-”

“I’ll take those. You carry the flashlight and the clothes.”

“You brought extra clothes?”

I pulled out my spare shirt and sweats and thrust them into his arms.

“Just in case. I know what you said about clothes changing with me, but… you also said every werewolf is a bit different.”

Despite the tension, Griffin let out the smallest ghost of a laugh.

“You’d have woken up naked last month if you destroyed your clothes when you turned.”

“Oh.” I smiled. “I didn't think of that.”

The thick heavy anticipation eased, just a bit. I slung the rope over my shoulder and Griffin flicked on the flashlight. The beam illuminated the barnhouse, attracting moths that cast massive fluttering shadows on the rusted panel walls. The nighttime air smelled like dust and dry grass.

It was creepy, but familiar. I pushed open the heavy wooden door and led Griffin inside.

“There’s an indoor tool shed in the back with a lock. We’ll use that.”

Griffin looked around nervously as we crossed the rotted wooden floor to the shed. The smallest sounds made him jump. I turned.

“Are you scared?”

He managed to put on a strained smile.

“Help me with this.”

I dragged an old handmade chair into the cramped, dust-covered shed, and threw the rope onto the floor and grabbed the end. Then I looped one end of the rope around the back of the chair and sat.

Griffin held the flashlight and helped me wind the rope tightly around my torso, slowly securing me to the chair. I instructed him on how to tie the knot, and then he pulled a few thick zip-ties from my pocket and tied my wrists and ankles together.

“You think this chair will hold?”

He looked down at me, wide-eyed and gaunt like a ghost in the light of the flashlight. His throat bobbed as he swallowed.

“I-I’m not sure.” He finally said. “Can you move?”

I strained against the rope. It wasn’t quite as tight as I would have liked, but it was the tightest Griffin could get it.

“Not really. This, and the zip-ties, and the lock… I think I should be good.”

Griffin nodded uneasily. He checked his phone.

“Twenty-five minutes until moonrise,” he said.

“Damn, I guess it doesn’t hurt to be early.”

“Yeah. That took less time than I expected.”

He stood there in silence, his flashlight trained, a thin shadow in the dark doorframe.

Maybe it was because I was finally *ready*, but the fear and apprehension that I had been suppressing deep down started to seep out. My heartbeat gently strained against the pressure of the rope. I looked up at Griffin.

“Do you think it’ll hurt?”

He bit his lip. “A little.”

“Is it like they do it in the movies? All that hair growing, ears and nose stretching out, teeth sharpening?”

“I’m… not sure what it actually looks like.”

“What? How’s that?”

“I…”

The flashlight beam wavered. After a long, hesitant silence, Griffin took half a step back. He closed the door behind him.

“I’m really glad you believed me, Darron,” he finally said.

He walked forward and put his hand on my shoulder. He took a short breath.

“The police can’t know. They’d go hunting for people with lycanthropy, and they’d lock them up, study them, *kill* them.”

His breathing quickened. So did his words, spilling faster and faster.

“But you believed me. Even though I didn’t make sense. Even though you found me there, miraculously alive just like you. You told them what I asked you to, you trusted me, you *saved* me…”

I jumped as the flashlight clattered to the floor. Griffin clamped both hands over my shoulders, cold and trembling. His eyes stared straight into mine.

“You kept my secret,” he whispered.

I stared blankly up at him, uncomprehending. The flashlight beam came to rest on the far wall. Its flickering reflection illuminated the tears welling in Griffin’s eyes.

“I forgot last month, Darron. I forgot the date of the full moon. I messed up. I went to the party. And I was… *I was so hungry…*”

“W-wait-”

“I’m sorry,” Griffin sobbed. “I lied. Your clothes wouldn’t change with you. I had to tell you that, because you were dressed that morning, and I couldn’t let you know-”

His words faltered, morphing into a strange, terrifying sound in the back of his throat, somewhere between a groan and a guttural snarl. His nails dug painfully into my shoulders.

A pit opened in my stomach. The ill-fitting shirt and oversized pants I had found Griffin in, as he hid in Keith's closet pretending they were his…

Griffin shakily raised his head and smiled, a pained grimace with split-open lips.

“It’s moonrise,” he whispered. “Are you scared?”

Griffin doubled over. I watched, petrified, as he arched his back, his shirt bulging, bones stretching and crawling underneath his skin. He convulsed violently. Crying, growling, snarling sounds escaped his throat, sounds that no human should be making. Snaking masses of muscle and sinew slowly rippled under what used to be his bone-thin arms, and his clothes pulled taut over his spine and tore open like tissue paper, revealing thick black hair piercing through shivering pale skin.

Red-hot pain stabbed into my shoulders. I let loose a guttural scream as razor claws raked slowly down my arms, the weight leaned onto them growing and growing until finally they toppled my chair backwards onto the floor. I found myself shaking, staring straight up at the gaping red maw of the creature, twisting and snapping in some grotesque almost-canine shape. Its teeth elongated into sharp points and its tongue morphed until the ragged cries coming from its throat became nothing more than animal noises.

The massive black wolf towered over me, hot breath escaping between rows of teeth like knives. Its piercing yellow eyes fixed on me with an unmistakable hunger, and without so much as a moment of hesitation, it lunged.

Through the cold grip of supernatural terror, a primal survival instinct shot through me. I rolled to the side, rope and chair and all, narrowly dodging the wolf’s massive jaws as they clamped down where my throat had been a split second ago. At the same time, my mind raced, a million thoughts a second. I heaved my body and furiously slammed the chair into the floor until the rusted nails came apart, and the ropes loosened just enough to move my arms. Then I brought my hands, still zip-tied together, to the closest object I could find.

As the wolf lunged at me a second time, I swung the leg of the chair as hard as I could, slashing its snout with rusted broken nails and sending it staggering to the side of the cramped shed.

I got up and bunny-hopped to the near wall of the shed. The wooden shelves were long gone and the bare steel brackets were rusted and falling apart. I shoved a sharp-looking edge between my wrists and yanked with all my might.

The zip-tie broke cleanly. I started to turn, but massive paws slammed into me, crushing my back against the wall. The wolf snarled, its snout inches from my face. Its claws slowly sank into my neck and shoulders.

Through the mad rush of pain and panic, I realized I remembered. Maybe the sheer terror had made me forget, or maybe I really had gotten too drunk that night. But I remembered what happened at the house party, as my life flashed before my eyes. Screams that cut through the pounding music before they choked and died just as quickly. My friends staggering in drunken confusion and falling to a massive shadow, one by one. The black wolf pinning me to the floor. My addled mind floundering, doing the only thing I could think of to save myself.

As Griffin’s teeth flashed around my throat, my hands shot up and gripped his jaws, prying them open with impossible strength born out of sheer desperation. His fangs sank into my palms, but I could barely feel it through the pounding adrenaline. My arms shuddered as I pushed. His mouth opened wider and wider, hot breath and drool spilling in my face, until he was gurgling, whining, the side of his snout slowly tearing as misshapen surgical sutures burst open one by one.

With a sickening *crack*, Griffin’s jaw gave way. Blood spilled down my hands as he howled, twisting his weight off of me. I grabbed an old shovel off the wall and jammed the head into his thick hide as hard as I could, again, and again, and again.

Griffin cried and stumbled back. I dove out of the shed, heaved the door closed, and slammed the deadbolt into place.

Muffled shuffling and crying seeped from the shed as I used the blade of the shovel to break the zip-tie around my ankles. My every limb was shaking uncontrollably, my arms covered up to my elbows in warm slick blood, my right palm stinging from the row of teeth marks that had pierced my skin.

I picked up my flashlight and staggered toward the barn door.

==========

You have to believe me when I say werewolves exist.

When the police opened the barnhouse shed, Griffin was gone. The investigators collected what evidence they could. The rope. The zip-ties. The blood and the weapons with my fingerprints all over them.

I pointed to the wolf hairs, the unidentified blood types. The bruised teeth marks across my palm. The animal DNA they would inevitably find when the results came back from the lab.

But they didn’t believe me. They only kept asking me where I had hidden the body. Demanding that I confess any homicidal tendencies that may be relevant to the house party slaughter case. Whispering about my warped sense of reality, how I saw people as monsters from fantasy.

I cried that Griffin was still out there, hunting and hungering for human flesh, but they ignored me. They’ve kept me locked up for almost a month now.

Lately, I’ve been feeling strange.

I feel stronger. My senses suddenly keener. I feel like I can smell the prison guards from two cell blocks away.

When I grip the steel bars of my cell, they feel like twigs in my hands.

They didn’t believe me that werewolves exist.

So now, I guess they’ll learn the [hard way](https://www.reddit.com/r/magpie_quill/).
