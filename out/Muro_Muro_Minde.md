Hello nosleep,  
  
If I ask friends, family, or colleagues, they will think I've completely lost it. Therefore, I'm asking “Reddit” for advice instead, as I assume you are more open to the mystical and occult than the average person on the street.  
  
I've always been a skeptic, but what happened to my best friend "Jakob" has shaken me to my core. I need to share this story because I can no longer bear the burden alone. What started as a mourning process over a deceased grandmother spiraled into a nightmarish descent into the occult and inexplicable.  
  
Jakob wasn't just a friend; he was like a brother. We shared everything from childhood secrets to the challenges of adulthood. But after his grandmother's death, he changed. From being a cheerful and sarcastic soul, he became reclusive, paranoid, and physically decayed. It started subtly but quickly escalated into a state where he couldn't sleep, attacked by an intense and irrational fear.  
  
The daily Jakob I knew disappeared into the shadow of a man who screamed at night and mumbled incomprehensible words. Eventually, the situation became so severe that we, his family and I, forced him into psychiatric care. What followed was a series of heartbreaking events that culminated in his tragic death under mysterious and horrifying circumstances.  
  
But the story doesn't end there. At his funeral, I received a testamentary letter and an ancient chest from Jakob. The letter, written on his death day, revealed a terrifying tale of an antique jewelry chest, a strange stone, and whispering voices. It spoke of a dark presence that plagued him, a presence that drove him to madness.  
  
At first, I thought it was the manifestation of his mental decline, but curiosity and grief drove me to investigate further. I began to delve into his notes, his sketches, and ancient folklore. What I found led me down a path I could never have imagined. A path that led to ancient Nordic myths about a Mare, a malevolent spirit that tortures its victims at night.  
  
As you may know, Mare is the root of the word nightmare, and believe me, what I've discovered is nothing less than the most vivid nightmare you can imagine. I have documented my entire investigation, my thoughts, and the terrifying details of Jakob's last days on my blog:

If you're like me, skeptical but open to the mysterious, if you've felt an unexplainable fear in the dark of night, I urge you to read on. I share this not for sympathy but in the hope of finding answers, in the hope that Jakob's suffering and death were not in vain. Visit my blog, and perhaps together we can uncover the truth about the dark force that took my friend.  
  
It's possible, of course, that Jakob was hallucinating or just making it all up, let's pray that's the case, but that's not a chance I'm not willing to take.  
  
What on earth am I going to do? In just the few days I've had the necklace in my possession, I've felt an increasingly stronger urge to pick it up and study it closer. How can I protect myself and others from this demon?  
  
Praying for some good advice.  
  
Thank you for reading, and be careful. Some nightmares are more real than we dare to admit.
