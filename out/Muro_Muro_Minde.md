  
Hello.   
I've gotten myself into a situation I don't know how to handle…  
If I ask friends, family, or colleagues, they will think I've completely lost it. Therefore, I'm asking “Reddit” for advice instead, as I assume you are more open to the mystical and occult than the average person on the street.  
**PS:** The content is originally written in Norwegian, then translated into English using Chat GPT. I apologize in advance for any linguistic errors resulting from this  
  
I have chosen to anonymize the content, out of respect for the deceased's family and friends. The story I am about to tell happened about a year ago and concerns my good friend "Jacob", let's call him that for the occasion. "Jacob" has been my best friend since elementary school. We visited each other so often during our upbringing that our families in many ways melted together into one big family. We were both socially hopeless, preferring gaming and science fiction over partying and football. This, of course, resulted in us being bullied at school, but we had each other, and that was more than enough in many ways.  
  
This close contact persisted even after school and university, and we eventually ended up with apartments in the same building, much to my girlfriend's great frustration.   
I can understand her since I probably spent too much time in a virtual world at “Jacob’s”   
and too little time in front of the kitchen sink at home. I worked as an IT consultant at the time, while "Jacob", on his part, was “looking for new challenges” as they say. In reality he was a rather laid-back, artistic, and somewhat lazy type who believed that long days and late nights with gaming, drawing, and unemployment benefits were not too bad. This naturally resulted in a rather tight economy, but it all worked out when he inherited a good sum of money from his late grandmother.   
"Jacob" was generally a cheerful type who always had a witty comment or a warm smile ready. After his grandmother passed away, this began to change. It was barely noticeable at first. He was perhaps a bit more introverted than usual, but I attributed this to grief following the death. I assumed it would all blow over once he had some time. But that didn’t happen, rather the opposite…  
  
"Jacob" became increasingly anxious and nervous and could startle at the slightest thing. He quickly lost weight and got large dark circles under his eyes. I tried to reach him repeatedly, but it was like talking to a wall. No matter what I said to him, it just didn't sink in. Something that was quite hurtful since we had always been able to talk about everything. One day when he seemed especially tired and weary, I offered to accompany him to the doctor, so he could get help, or at least something to sleep on. Then he became hysterical and screamed, "I can't sleep, I can't sleep, please don't force me to sleep." After this incident, I became so worried that I contacted his family, but they also couldn't reach him. In consultation with a doctor, it was therefore decided to have him committed involuntarily for a period. It seemed to work well at first, he became calmer and could occasionally hold normal conversations. But then the relapse came, and everything took a turn for the worse.  
  
Several different treatment methods were tried, but without result. The nurses described him as very irritable around bedtime and nearly catatonic for the rest of the day.   
Towards the end, he became so panicky and aggressive that he was transferred to a secure unit. Here he was medicated against his will and sometimes tied to the bed to prevent him from harming himself or others. In the summer of 2020, "Jacob" died, locked in a padded cell, like an animal. He was in very bad shape when they found him. The corpse lay on its back in the bed with arms down by the sides and eyes wide open. The body was full of bruises, and the lips were glued together with superglue. The mouth was filled with blood that flowed out of an oval hole in the left cheek. Upon closer examination, the police discovered that all the teeth were crushed and partially pressed into the gums.   
The initial investigations at the scene could not reveal any obvious cause of death. Therefore, the subsequent autopsy report concluded that the death was due to a heart attack. The fact that the lips were glued together and that there was a hole in the cheek was described by the police as a self-inflicted act that had to be seen in connection with the deceased's mental health condition. As for the extensive dental damage, the pathologist believed this was the result of a series of epileptic seizures. But something didn't add up here, "Jacob" didn't have epilepsy. They had indeed screened him for this earlier in his illness. We pointed this out to the police on several occasions. After pressure from the family's lawyer, much to our surprise, an investigation was initiated, despite the fact that no criminal act could be proven. But this was probably more of a show for the public, as the prosecution chose to close the case almost as quickly as they had opened it:  
  
"The case is closed due to the position of the evidence. The investigation concludes that this is a natural death, and that no criminal act can be proven."  
  
As with any official document, it was of course elaborately detailed, up, down, and sideways, in an excessively pompous, heavy, and bureaucratic language. But I won't bore you with all the details. In short, the following points were the basis for the dismissal:

* Only the on-duty nurse had access to "Jacob's" room, and he was provably in the guard room all night.
* The cameras in the corridor outside Jacob's room also showed no one entering or leaving the room during the relevant time period.
* The crime scene investigations and the subsequent autopsy report showed no signs that any criminal act had been committed.

I was quite sure that this would be the last I would hear about my friend's passing.   
But to my great surprise, shortly after the funeral, I was summoned to the reading of "Jacob's" will. The family naturally received all the values left by "Jacob", and I certainly didn't understand why I was present. But right at the end, it was announced that I was also listed in the will. I received a small, inconspicuous package, carefully wrapped in newspaper and held together by brown twine, as well as a rather thick envelope.
