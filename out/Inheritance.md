A few days ago, I received a call.

My head was spinning when I got off the phone. It had been a lawyer reaching out to inform me that my grandfather had died and they were sending me a watch he bequeathed me. I tried to tell her that she must have made a mistake, that it wasn’t possible that he’d just died, but she was adamant. She verified my identity and had documentation on her end to prove it—I tried to wrap my head around it all.

My father had lied.

He told me that his dad had died before I was even born—before he’d even met my mother; said my grandpa ran out on him and grandma, and was killed in a bar fight—my grandmother corroborated the story too. Now I found out that not only was grandpa alive the whole time, but he knew about me; he knew he had a grandson.

Had my father told him about me? Were they in touch? Did dad even realize he was lying?

I had so many questions, but of course my father couldn’t answer them—thirty-years and countless hours of therapy later and I still see his lifeless eyes every night.

I was only ten when I came home from football practice to find my parents’ mangled bodies—I won’t go into details, but suffice to say that neither of them was *whole* when I discovered them.

The police were baffled by the crime. With the amount of violence displayed during the killing, they expected to at least find some evidence left behind by the murderer—a lock of hair, fingerprints, blood, saliva—they came up empty. The scene somehow presented both as a chaotic, disorganized crime of passion and one that was meticulously premeditated. Nothing was stolen, my parents had no enemies that I or anyone else was aware of; it was as if they’d be executed by a ghost.

After their deaths, I was sent to live with my mother’s sister and her husband several states away (as was stipulated in my parents’ will). Aunt Sue and Uncle Brett did the best they could given the circumstances—I wasn’t an easy child to deal with by any means before, and I was only worse after. I moved out the day I turned eighteen and haven’t spoken with them much since—I think we all came to the unspoken conclusion that everyone would be happier if we just moved on and tried leave what happened behind us.

They wouldn’t have any knowledge of my estranged grandfather anyway, I knew, as they’d been told the same story of his death by my father—I pondered more whether, at the time of his murder, *he* was even aware that his father was still alive. Moreover, my father had no siblings, and his mother drank herself to death several years after the murders (which I knew to be true as I attended the funeral). So, there was no one left alive that I could contact to try and sort out why the details I’d been told of my grandfather’s death were a complete fabrication.

Too, I wondered why he’d never tried to get in touch with me before. It was clear that he knew I was alive and felt something of a familial bond for me as he’d gone to a lawyer to make sure that I could get his watch after he died. What circumstance was it that he needed to “dead” when he was alive, and could only reveal to me that he was alive after he died?

Over the next few days, I speculated wildly as to what that circumstance might have been.

I imagined scenarios where he held a top-secret position with the government that required his cover be so absolute, his own wife and child had to think he bit the dust. Or maybe he’d testified against the wrong person and had to “die” to protect them. There was also the possibility that he was just a shitty person—an abuser, an alcoholic—and grandma or dad kicked him out and warned him they’d kill him if he ever came back, then told everyone he died so that no one tried to get in touch with him.

Whatever the case was, I hoped I’d get more answers when the watch arrived—anticipating a note might come with it that would explain everything.

But in that I was sorely disappointed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This morning, I received a knock on my door, and signed for a small package that was return addressed from the lawyer’s office that contacted me. Opening the box, I found inside just two items—the expected watch, and a small, sealed envelope with my name on it.

First, I quickly examined the timepiece—the band and case were gold with a black dial, white hands, and blood red stones (that I suspected to be rubies) for number indicators. I searched for a maker’s mark of some kind, but found none and surmised it might be a custom piece.

Setting it down on the counter, I turned my attention to the envelope—believing that within I would find the answers I was looking for. However, the note my grandfather had penned for me contained neither exposition on his life nor information on the watch. In fact, he had written only three, short words.

*Put it on.*

‘That’s it?’ I thought, frustrated now with the man I’d never met.

But then, I remembered my musings of my grandfather as a high-level government agent. My mind flashed to spy movies and how the protagonist always had a special watch that had secret functions. Now, I speculated that something would happen when I put it on—maybe it would play a message or project a clue onto the wall.

Eagerly, I slipped it over my left hand and, as I thought it might, something did happen when I shut the clasp. However, it wasn't anything like what I'd dreamt up. No, what I experienced the instant the mechanism clicked closed was...

Agony.

“FUCK!!!” I yelled. White-hot pain radiated down my arm and through my entire body—so intense that it dropped me to my knees. The watch clamped down so tightly that I worried it was going to cut my hand clean off, and I swore I felt it bite me under the case.

Desperately, I tried to undo the clasp, but it wouldn't come free—I tore one of my nails off trying to force it open. Crawling to the kitchen, I pulled a screwdriver from my junk drawer, sat up against the dishwasher, and pried at the mechanism—it didn’t budge in the slightest. I flipped my wrist over and began stabbing at the crystal, but it didn't shatter, dent, or even form the smallest scratch.

The pain was now so excruciating that tears cascaded down my face, and I could think of only one thing to do.

I reached into a drawer near my shoulder and pulled out a meat cleaver.

Placing my left hand down on the tile floor, I raised the cleaver in my right—convinced that the pain I’d experience when I swung would be a welcome relief compared to what I was feeling now. But before I could make the cut, my head exploded.

I’d never screamed so loudly in my entire life. I dropped the cleaver and fell to the floor. Clasping my skull in both hands, I writhed on the ground, expelling every expletive in the English language in what I imagined were my final moments. Truthfully, I was praying that they would be—the torment was beyond what I could handle—I began to beg for death.

*Not yet.*

Between my howling and flailing around, I barely heard it—a whisper hissed inside my own mind. I wondered if the agony was causing a psychotic break, and I was now hallucinating.

Yet, the pain then slowly subsided. I sat up, rubbing my temples, and leaned back against the dishwasher again, trying to catch my breath. My wrist still throbbed underneath the watch, but it was manageable, and there was a small trickle of blood running down my hand from under the case. I gave a final, feeble attempt at removing it, but was unsurprised when I found that I couldn’t.

“What is this?” I asked to the empty kitchen.

*A transfer of ownership*, the whisper replied.

Now, I believed that for sure the torture had broken my brain, and I was hearing things.

*You’re not hallucinating.* The response echoed inside my head.

“What the fuck?” I said to nobody.

*I want to show you something.*

“Please stop this. Whatever this is, just please stop.” I begged.

*Everything will be clear momentarily.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mind was flooded with memories, but not my own—I was living the life of another man.

My grandfather’s.

I saw every moment, from the day that he put the watch on, until the day that he died.

He fought it at first, tried desperately to ignore it, but it seeped into his mind more and more every day. It was telling him to do terrible things to his family whenever he was around them, and he worried that he wouldn’t be able to stop himself forever. He wanted to warn them, but it wouldn’t let him form the words. He attempted to cut his own hand off, just as I had, but it wouldn’t let him swing the hatchet. He finally considered suicide, but it wouldn’t let him load the gun.

Every time that he looked at his son, he heard the whisper.

*Kill him. I’m hungry; I want blood. Feed me his blood!*

And every time he looked at his wife, he heard the same.

He tried to assuage it with the blood of an animal—he was an avid hunter and shot a deer hoping that it would be enough to quiet the voice, but it only made it angry.

*What is this, the blood of some foul beast?! I’m starving! I need human blood! HUMAN BLOOD!*

As time wore on, it grew more impatient and tried to force his hand. He would find that at the dinner table, he gripped the steak knives a little too tightly, and it took all his fortitude to put them back down. One evening, when his wife was watching television on the couch, he walked up behind her with a hammer poised to smash into her skull—he only just barely managed to stop himself when she turned around and he saw her face.

That was the last straw—he knew his family was no longer safe around him and he chose to leave them—promising the voice that he would do what it asked. He would feed it; he would do whatever it wanted as long as it stayed away from his family.

They made an agreement—it was easier for both of them. He left his wife and son without a word to either and began *hunting* for it—telling himself with each kill that he had to do it to protect those he loved most.

Several years after he absconded, a man was found dead in an alley behind a bar—his face was so badly beaten that it was unrecognizable, but he had all of my grandfather’s credentials on him— grandpa’s way of preventing his family from every trying to find him.

For twenty-years, the partnership between my grandfather and the watch worked well-enough. It allowed him to maintain most of the control over his own body as long as he fed it whenever it got hungry.

But, in time, it wanted more.

It didn’t like that he still occasionally refused it—it didn’t like how long it had to wait between meals or listening to him weep and apologize to each of them. With each feeding, it had grown stronger, and having lived as a parasite in his system for so long, it had buried itself deep enough in his brain that it felt it could finally completely push him aside.   
  
He tried to stop it—he knew the even more heinous things it would do if it was fully in charge. And he angered it with his defiance. It wanted to teach him a lesson—a lesson he would never forget—a lesson that would ensure his docility forever. 

I saw my parent’s house come into view—I saw the Halloween decorations laid out in the yard exactly as I remembered them, exactly as they had been on the day they died.

And I saw it tear them apart.

With his son gone, I became the new threat—if he ever resisted again, I would be next.

He finally relented.

After that, he became a passenger in his own body—watching the driver use his hands to do unspeakable things for years and years until he became old and frail. Then, with its current host dying, it made plans for who would be the next.

It chose me.

By then, my grandfather was far too weak to attempt to stop it—I could only hear him softly sobbing as it carried out its plan.

It visited the lawyer and made the arrangements to be sent to me upon my grandfather’s death; it wrote the note and sealed it in the envelope. And then it sapped the last of his life when the final piece of paperwork was signed—he died right there in her office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The memories faded out, and I was back in my kitchen.

*Do you understand?*

“Understand what?” I asked it.

*Do you understand why I’ve showed you this?*

Considering for a moment, I realized that I did. It wanted me to see what it had already done to my family—how it had taken my parents and my grandfather from me—and that there was no use in trying to fight it. I didn't even need to say it aloud.

*Yes, that’s right. I chose you because you would understand best what I can do. I don’t want to fight you—it will much more painful for you than it will be for me, but still—it would be far easier for both of us if you don’t try to defy me like your grandfather did.*   
  
*Just give me control, now. I see in your memories a woman named…Jess. We wouldn’t want anything to happen to Jess, would we?* 

“No! Please, don’t hurt her.”  
  
*I won’t; I promise. I won’t touch her if you just give in now and let me have you.*   
  
“God, please! Please, just let me think for a minute!” I appealed to it.  
  
*Time is short—I’m hungry.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t know what to do—I wish it would just give me more time—I thought writing this all out might help me make my decision.  
  
Jess is my wife and we’ve been separated for months, but I still love her more than anything. Thankfully she’s not here, but I know where she lives, so it knows where she lives.   
  
And it’s already creeping into my thoughts; it’s showing me what it’ll make me do to her if I don’t give in to it, whispering its horrible plans. I know that I won’t be able to stop it from gaining control forever even if I do try to fight it, and it’s stronger than when my grandfather first put it on.   
  
I can’t make any moves against it either; it knows all of my thoughts even before I do.   
  
There’s no way out.  
  
I think it's best if I just let it take me now—it promised not to hurt her if I do; I only wish I could warn her.  
  
Jesus, the things it’s going to do—that I’m going to do—once I give myself over to it.  
  
God forgive me.
