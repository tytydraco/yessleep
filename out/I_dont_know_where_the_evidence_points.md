Hey Reddit folks, 

I'm going to identify myself as L (M17) from "São Miguel das Águas," a small town in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil. I need to share something that's happening here and ask for your help.  
It all began a few weeks ago when something completely unexpected happened. That night, I was heading home after a day at school. I was at home when my neighbor, Mr. Ribeiro, came to my door with a concerned look on his face. He told me that his hardware store had been broken into the previous night. What caught everyone's attention was that the intruder had left a strange symbol graffiti on the wall. It was some sort of spiral with a circle in the center. It seemed so out of place in our town, and this crime became the talk of the town for the next few days (considering we don't have much excitement around here). Mr. Ribeiro was shocked because it was the first time something like this had happened in São Miguel das Águas.  
Initially, everyone in town thought it was an isolated incident. After all, who would break into a small hardware store in the countryside? The police investigated but didn't find many leads. It seemed like a senseless crime. However, a few days later, something even stranger happened. The town square was vandalized. The benches in the square were smashed, the flowers trampled, and once again, that cursed symbol was there, sprayed in various parts of the square. It was at this point that I started to get genuinely concerned. It seemed like we might be dealing with a gang. It could just be a group of unruly youngsters, but it's always good to stay vigilant.  
And then, the situation got even weirder. Some time later, I was scrolling through TikTok on my phone when I received an audio message from my friend "Rafael" (a fictitious name). It seemed like a normal audio message at first, but as I listened, it became clear that something was very wrong. Rafael was gasping for breath and sounded terrified as he whispered unintelligible words, some of which I could make out as "they," "circle," "fall."  
The audio message was chilling, but also confusing. I tried to respond, but he didn't reply, and my subsequent audio messages didn't reach him either. The next morning, when I went to his house, he simply wasn't there. His family was worried, and we went to the police together. I showed them the strange message, and they conducted a brief investigation, asking me to send the audio and not leave town for the time being (does that mean I'm a suspect?). Rafael was my best friend, and I wasn't comfortable just sitting around with all this happening, so I decided to conduct my own investigation, asking around the neighborhood, some school friends, and so on, but I haven't found any new leads yet.  
That's why (and for two other reasons I intend to explain) I decided to seek help here on Reddit, specifically in the nosleep community. I've been told that some members have skills in unraveling things. But what made me even more frightened were two other strange events that have occurred since I started my investigation:  
About three days after Rafael disappeared, I finally went back to school. As I was approaching, I saw a cardboard box wrapped in black plastic hanging on my gate. (It's worth specifying that here, it's common for delivery people to hang packages inside the gate if there's no one at home when they come, as leaving them on the street isn't very secure.) I passed by Mr. Ribeiro again, who said that the delivery person had come by and had insisted a lot on the importance of that package until, after a while, he got tired of waiting for me and left it there. I didn't remember ordering anything, so it seemed very strange to me. I thanked Mr. Ribeiro, went inside, and started tearing open the packaging. When I finished opening it, I almost vomited. Inside a small box, there was a severed finger, still moist with blood at its base, with a strange cut that exposed part of the bone. The police later concluded that it was Rafael's finger. There was no sender, and Mr. Ribeiro's description didn't help much since the man was wearing a cap and a medical mask.  
To wrap things up and increase my sense of urgency, which leads me to write this so that, in case something happens to me, these important details won't be lost, last night I received a message on my phone that said: "I know he talked to you," which could be scary in itself, but what makes me believe it's something much deeper is that my phone was completely turned off.  
I don't know what's happening in São Miguel das Águas, but I'm determined to uncover the truth and find my friend. Any help or guidance you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening. And I feel that something strange is happening here, something I can't fully explain but that makes me feel like I'm being watched, as if something is observing us, even now.  
  
I'll be back with updates as soon as possible, goodbye for now.
