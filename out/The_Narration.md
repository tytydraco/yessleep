*Your story has been viewed 2.1M times on r/nosleep*

I stared at the notification, still not quite believing it. Three days ago, I'd posted "I Found a Box of VHS Tapes in My Basement - Update 7 (Final)" under my username u/PROXeR__OiShi. It was the conclusion to my series about finding mysterious tapes showing impossible footage of my own death.

Pure fiction, of course. Just another horror story.

Then the email came:

*From: DarkNarratives@gmail.com
Subject: Narration Rights for VHS Series*

*Hey u/PROXeR__OiShi!*

*I run the Dark Narratives YouTube channel (3.2M subscribers). Would love to narrate your VHS series. Offering $500 for exclusive rights. Your story really got to me - especially that part about the timestamps matching your childhood home videos. Brilliant stuff.*

*Let me know if you're interested.*

*- Marcus*

I checked out his channel. High production value, atmospheric background music, professional voice work. The kind of break every r/nosleep writer dreams of.

I replied immediately: *Yes.*

His response came within minutes, with a contract attached. One line caught my attention:

*"Narrator reserves the right to make minor adjustments to enhance dramatic effect."*

Fair enough. I signed.

That night, I got a notification that he'd posted the first part. I clicked, eager to hear my words brought to life.

But something was wrong.

The story he was reading... it wasn't quite mine. The basic plot was the same â€“ protagonist finds VHS tapes, each showing a different version of their death. But details had changed.

In my story, the first death was a car crash.
In his narration, it was drowning.

In my story, the tapes were from the 90s.
In his version, they were dated 1987.

In my story, the protagonist lived at 42 Maple Street.
He said 1313 Raven's Way.

*My old address.*

I checked the contract again. "Minor adjustments." This was more than minor.

I messaged him: *Hey, noticed some changes to the story. The address especially - any reason for that?*

His reply was casual: *Just felt more atmospheric. Hope you don't mind.*

Then he sent me a preview of part two.

It opened with a description of the protagonist's childhood bedroom: *"Blue wallpaper with rocket ships. A teddy bear missing its left eye. A baseball trophy from Little League, 1987."*

My childhood bedroom. My teddy bear. My trophy.

*How could you know these details?* I demanded.

*What do you mean? They're in your original post.*

They weren't. I checked obsessively, reading every line of my story three times. Those details had never been there.

Until they were.

I watched in horror as my Reddit post changed before my eyes, details shifting and rewriting themselves to match his narration. The time stamp showed it had been edited - three days ago.

But I hadn't edited it.

Part three went up: The protagonist finding a tape labeled "Christmas Morning, 1987."

The description matched my actual childhood home video perfectly. Every gift. Every reaction. Every word.

*Stop*, I messaged him. *This isn't what I wrote.*

*Are you feeling okay?* he replied. *This is exactly what you wrote. Check your post.*

I did. The words were there, as if they'd always been there. But they hadn't. They couldn't have been.

Could they?

Part four: A tape showing a teenage version of me dying in a house fire.
Part five: Me drowning in our family pool.
Part six: A car crash on prom night.

Each death described in perfect detail, as if filmed by someone who'd been there. Someone who'd watched me grow up. Someone who'd imagined every possible way I could die.

*Who are you?* I demanded.

*Just a narrator*, he responded. *Bringing your story to life.*

The final part went up tonight. I didn't want to watch it, but I couldn't stop myself.

His voice was different this time. Familiar.

*"I found the last tape today,"* he read. *"It was different from the others. No death scene. Just footage of someone writing a story. Posting it on r/nosleep. Getting a message from a YouTube narrator..."*

I slammed my laptop shut. Opened it again.

The video was gone. His channel was gone. The messages were gone.

My original Reddit post now ended differently:

*Update: If you're reading this, don't reply to emails from Dark Narratives. Don't sign the contract. He doesn't narrate stories.*

*He rewrites them.*

*I know, because I'm the narrator. I've been doing this for years, finding writers, changing their stories, making them real. And now it's happening to me.*

*Someone else is narrating my story.*

*I just got the email:*

*"Would love to narrate your story about being a narrator who rewrites stories. Brilliant stuff."*

*The contract is in my inbox.*

*My cursor is hovering over 'sign.'*

*I know I shouldn't.*

*But I'm going to.*

*Because that's what I wrote in the original story.*

*The one I'm in right now.*

*The one you're reading.*

*The one someone else will narrate next.*

*The one that's already changing...*

I check my email.

There's a new message:

*Would love to narrate your story about a narrator narrating a story about a narrator...*

I reach for the mouse.

I know I shouldn't click.

But I will.

Because that's what you wrote.

Isn't it?
