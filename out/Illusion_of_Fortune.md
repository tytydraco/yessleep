Every morning, the usual monotony. Alarm rings at 6:30. Drag myself out of bed. Take a hot shower. Dress in my dull grey office attire. Cereal. Out the door. But that particular morning, the day everything changed, began with one tiny variation.  
  
I turned off the alarm, got out of bed, and glanced at my bedroom mirror. My reflection wasn’t mimicking my movements. Instead, it was standing still, staring at me with dark, empty eyes.  
  
Buzzz. My phone vibrated on the nightstand, snapping me out of my paralysis. I blinked. My reflection was normal again. Chalking it up to sleep deprivation, I headed to the bathroom to begin my routine.  
  
While brushing my teeth, I hummed the tune to an old song, my thoughts wandering to the drudgery of the coming day. As I spit out the toothpaste, the humming didn’t stop. It continued, echoing back at me from the shower’s tiled walls.  
  
Startled, I called out, “Hello?” No response. But as I tilted my head, trying to locate the source, the humming grew louder, more pronounced. It was MY voice, distorted and distant.  
  
Attempting to maintain my sanity, I rushed through the rest of my morning routine, trying to shake off the eerie events. My hands trembled as I tied my shoes. I felt a chill, as if the very air around me had grown colder.  
  
Stepping outside, the usual dawn chorus of chirping birds was absent. Instead, the same haunting hum filled the air, coming from every direction. The quiet suburban neighborhood, usually alive with the sound of life, felt abandoned, devoid of warmth.  
  
Trying to convince myself it was just a peculiar morning, I quickened my pace to the bus stop. Few passengers were aboard, most lost in their phones or books. I took a seat near the window, seeking solace in the moving landscape.  
  
A sudden, sharp whisper in my ear made me jump.  
  
“Turn around.”  
  
Hesitatingly, I looked back. The bus was empty. Not just devoid of passengers, but completely barren. My reflection in the window grinned maliciously, though I felt no corresponding movement on my face.  
  
“Stay with us,” it whispered.  
  
Panicking, I pressed the stop button and leapt off at the next station. The world outside was no better. The same chilling hum pervaded the air. Storefronts stood vacant, mannequins in the display windows mimicking grotesque versions of human agony.  
  
As I walked faster, trying to escape, my phone buzzed with a new message notification. It was from an unknown number:  
  
“You can’t run from your own echo.”  
  
With terror gripping me, I headed towards my office, praying for some semblance of normalcy.

With terror gripping me, I headed towards my office, praying for some semblance of normalcy.  
  
  
  
As I pushed open the glass doors of my office building, the hum intensified, morphing into a jarring cacophony of whispered voices. The usual bustling lobby was deserted, save for the receptionist, Susan. But she was different—her skin a sickly grey, eyes vacant, mouthing the same haunting tune I’d been hearing all morning.  
  
I darted for the elevators, my heart racing. Upon reaching my floor, the hum became nearly deafening. Every one of my coworkers sat motionless at their desks, their faces twisted in terror, all repeating the same eerie melody. It felt like I was trapped in some twisted echo chamber.  
  
My best friend, Mark, was among them. I tried to shake him out of this trance.  
  
“Mark! What's happening?!”  
  
But instead of his voice, a deep, unnatural growl responded, “You don't belong here.”  
  
Suddenly, hands—pale, cold, and skeletal—grabbed me from all sides. My coworkers, or whatever they had become, were trying to pull me into their tormented symphony.  
  
“Join us,” their collective voice echoed, hollow and far away.  
  
With every ounce of strength, I broke free, sprinting towards my office and locking the door behind me. Breathing heavily, I tried to gather my thoughts.  
  
Snap out of it. It’s a dream. It has to be a dream.  
  
But the texts on my phone, the mirrored menace, the ghostly chorus—all felt shockingly real. A quick Google search yielded no results about any global phenomenon or any explanation for what I was experiencing.  
  
Suddenly, my computer screen flickered and shifted, displaying a live feed of me in my office. From a corner of the room where no camera existed.  
  
Click. Click. Click.  
  
Someone—or something—was typing in the chat box.  
  
“You can't escape your own echoes.”  
  
Desperate, I grabbed a fire extinguisher and smashed the window, the glass shattering into a million pieces. A sea of my doppelgängers awaited below, all mouthing the same terrifying tune, beckoning me to join their eternal choir.  
  
The door to my office began to buckle under the pressure from the outside. Mark's face appeared in the window, twisted in agony.  
  
“It’s inevitable,” he groaned.  
  
I needed to escape. With no way out, my last hope was the building's rooftop. I sprinted up the stairs, the haunting hum chasing after me. Reaching the rooftop, the entire city stretched below—its streets filled with these eerie echoes of the living, all of them mirroring my every move.  
  
Feeling trapped, my phone buzzed again. An incoming call from "Mom." Trembling, I answered.  
  
“You’ve been running from your echoes all your life,” her voice, distorted and chilling, said. “But every choice, every regret, they all catch up eventually.”  
  
Desperation gripped me. This wasn’t just a day gone wrong; it was a manifestation of all my fears, my regrets, my mistakes—all coming back to haunt me.  
  
“You cannot run. Accept us,” the voices grew louder, coming from every direction.  
  
Summoning my courage, I screamed back, “I won’t let you take me!”  
  
The ground trembled. The sky darkened. An enormous shadow loomed over, its form shifting, mirroring my terrified stance. It was an enormous, grotesque version of me, its eyes devoid of life, its mouth agape emitting that haunting hum.  
  
As it reached for me, I remembered a necklace my grandmother had given me—a talisman she claimed protected against dark spirits. I’d always considered it a piece of folklore, but now, with no options left, I clutched it tightly, whispering any prayers I could recall.  
  
The hum intensified, but now it was battling with another sound—a soft, comforting lullaby sung by my grandmother in my memories. The shadow hesitated, its form quivering.  
  
Harnessing the power of memories, love, and hope, I sang the lullaby aloud, my voice growing stronger with each note.  
  
The city began to shift. Daylight pierced through the darkness. The shadow shrieked in agony, the haunting hum fading into nothingness.  
  
Breathing heavily, I looked around. The familiar sounds of the city—traffic, chatter, life—filled the air. My phone buzzed again. This time, a genuine call from Mark.  
  
“Hey, you coming in today? You’re late!”  
  
Confused, relieved, and overwhelmed, I managed a weak laugh. “Yeah, just had a...weird start. I'll be there soon.”  
  
The ordinary world had returned, but the chilling memory of the echoes remained. It was a stark reminder that, while we might go about our mundane routines, the echoes of our past, our fears, and our regrets are always lurking, waiting for a moment to break through.  
  
And sometimes, the most terrifying horrors are the ones we create ourselves.
