I recently visited a Native American reservation, a Choctaw one to be exact. Me and a group of college kids went over there to listen to some stories for an Anthropology class we’re in. We were gathered in a building, and an elder there told us a story I really wanna share with everyone else. The elder guy was about 80 years old or so. He had lots of stories but the one I’m gonna tell you guys was the one he wanted us to remember the most, because it’s a story that carries a warning with it. I asked him if it’d be alright to share it online, and he was fine with it. The more people hear it he says, the better. So here’s the story:

 He told us the story of this one time his grandpa and his friends went camping, about 100 years or so ago. At that time, the tribe had largely been assimilated by the US Government, and moved to the current reservation, and when his grandpa and his buddies were free from being forced to attend boarding schools, they would return home and go out to be with nature. 

One summer they headed out into the nearby forest, and they brought some hunting supplies with them. They got pretty deep into the forest, far enough in that they couldn’t be found without someone walking for a few hours. They had found a small clearing and thought it was perfect to set up camp. They gathered some sticks and whatnot and made a fire. They’d brought some food with them, some fishing poles, bags, blankets, a simple kodak camera, a shotgun with a few bullets, and few other supplies. The weather was sunny and hot, that kind of mid-July weather when everything is humid and uncomfortable. The nights are cool and tolerable though, so they liked to sleep out on the ground near the fire, and look up at the stars in between the trees at night. 

Their parent’s didn’t mind much ‘cause they said they wanted them to be in touch with their roots. They’d been taught a lot of survival stuff from a young age, so they were more equipped to deal with that stuff than most kids. Plus they had each other in case any of them got into trouble. People were just built differently then, the elder said. So with their parent's permission the boys set out to spend a few weeks out in the woods. They had their campsite all set up, and a makeshift shelter made out of sticks and dead leaves. They’d go out into the woods together to shoot birds and catch fish. They’d spend most of the day walking around the forest, playing in the stream, hunting, and playing hide and seek. At night, they’d gather around the campfire, roast their meat and tell stories and gossip. The elder said his grandpa and his friends did this every year when they could, and that they had a lot of fun. It all changed one summer night though. 

It was one summer back in the late 1890s. He and his friends had gone out to their campsite like they did every summer. They'd been there for a few days, when the weather started changing. It had started getting more cloudy lately, and the kids weren't sure if they wanted to stay out or head home. Not wanting their camping trip to be cut short so they stayed. So that night his grandpa and his friends had been sleeping, when he had been woken up by a cold wind. He was shivering, and the fire had gone out. There weren’t even embers left over. His friends were apparently all fast asleep, and warm under their blankets, but grandpa had neglected to bring one with him. The nights were cool, but under the covers they could get really muggy and uncomfortable, so he liked to sleep out uncovered. He was regretting it now, and with the fire out the forest was nearly pitch black. There were quite a few clouds as it seemed a storm was moving in, so he didn’t even have star or moonlight to see. He was about to get up to wake one of his friends when he stopped dead in his tracks. He couldn’t be sure at first, but there was some sound in the wind. It started low at first, but it got louder. He heard some kind of animalistic screaming. His grandpa apparently said it sounded like a mix between a cow screaming and a pig squealing. It was the kind of sound that made a person wanna crawl into a grave and die before whatever made that sound got to them. Apparently his grandpa couldn’t properly explain the sound to the elder, but it was the most terrifying sound he had ever heard in his life. 

One of his friends woke up in a rage and yelled at the grandpa to cut it out, and that it wasn’t funny. His grandpa started arguing with the other kid and told him he wasn’t making that sound. The commotion had made the other kids wake up. The screaming was still going on, and all of the sudden all of them were silent as they listened. They heard rustling in the nearby woods, and the sound was getting louder. The elder’s grandpa tried to look out into the forest, but the darkness obscured his sight. He could hardly make out the black outlines of the trees. Freaked out, they all got up, and one of the kids grabbed the shotgun they had laying around. They listened to the screaming, all of them too scared to speak. The screaming suddenly cut out, and all that could be heard was the rustling of the wind. The kids all tried to sit back down and get back to sleep. His grandpa laid awake for a few hours listening to the wind. He managed to start a small fire again, and sat around it for a while while the air blew around him. He didn’t hear anything for the rest of the night, and before he knew it, he had fallen asleep again. 

Everyone woke up the next morning, to find tracks nearby the campsite. They were deer footprints. It seemed like someone had been hunting a deer last night. That would help to explain the screaming they heard. Someone must've gone into the woods late last night and hunted it down. But they could find no blood, or any signs of struggle. Stranger still, the footprints were alone, and they were staggered in an odd manner. Deer footprints tend to be much closer together but these were far apart. And they lead to the campsite. The boys mostly figured no one had got hurt, so they shrugged it off. They did things as usual that morning. They set out into the forest, and started hunting. They killed a few small birds, and brought them back to the campsite. They had lunch, and then they started playing out in the woods. It was still pretty cloudy out that day. They played until they got deeper and deeper into the forest. Soon, it was getting dark, and they needed to head back to the site. The kids started heading back when they heard the screaming again. 

It was really quiet, but it was unmistakable. The kids started walking faster. The screaming was getting louder. They started to run. Out of nowhere, this huge shape comes rushing through the forest at them. It flew by so quickly they couldn’t get their eyes to see it properly. Whatever it was, it was fast, white in color, and impossibly loud. They all stopped running and gathered together. Their breaths ragged and hearts beating a mile a minute. Whatever it was rushed right past them, screaming and hollering the entire time. Then it was gone. The screaming however, wasn’t. The boys started back even faster than before. They all made it to the campsite, panting. One of the boys said that they wanted to go home. Another kid said it was all a prank and someone was messing with them. One of the other kids was sure it was a bear or something. One kid was crying his eyes out and saying it was a Kashehotapolo, and it was gonna kill them. 

What on earth is a Kashehotapolo?  Well, the elder explained that the local Choctaw tribes knew of a supernatural creature that was half-man, half-deer, and that it featured prominently in a lot of local legends. It’s called the *Kashehotapolo.* It’s similar to the Goatman, but also a lot different. For one, a lot of Native American tribes around the country have stories about it. Some say they are malevolent creatures hellbent on killing whoever happens to stumble into their territory. Other stories say they are mischievous beings and simply enjoy scaring the crap out of people. Other stories paint them as witches who have animalistic powers, who dwell in forests waiting for men to seduce and kill. In some legends they are even helpful and kind. They go by a lot of names, but the Choctaw and many Plains Indians see them as terrifyingly evil creatures. The Choctaw in particular admire and fear the creature for its strength and speed. Some say they exist to get revenge on hunters that kill too many animals in the forest, and that they’re spiritual apparitions the forest creates to kill hunters that take too much from it. 

Most boys would have laughed at that kid, but the elder’s grandpa and his friends had taken it pretty seriously. He and all of them had grown up being told about these creatures. One of the other kids said it was a demon and that all they needed to do was pray and they’d be alright. One thing was for certain, it was getting far too dark to make their way back home out of the forest. They would have to spend another night in the forest with whatever this creature was. Elder’s grandpa didn’t know what was more frightening; having a Kashehotapolo in the forest with them, or a bear or something else. They huddled around together in their makeshift shelter. The shelter was pretty small and cramped, so they had to stay close together and look out of the opening in the shelter for signs of the beast. The night was dark and the wind started up again. There were dark clouds in the sky, and the kids didn’t dare get out to start a campfire. The entire time they sat talking about the creature and what it could be, the screaming never stopped. The wind blew, and the sounds of its screaming faded in and out. They heard twigs snapping, and leaves rustling in many random directions. None of the boys could get a read on where the screaming was coming from. 

It started to rain lightly. The boys started shivering, and the screaming was getting louder. The grandpa heard a scream right next to his ear that made him jump. Then the scream darted away in the opposite direction. The boy sat there shivering as the rain got heavier. Thunder began to sound out, making it even harder to tell where the strange animalistic scream was coming from. Every few moments, lightning would strike out in the distance, and the boys would see a half second of flash, which let them see the surrounding forest. The trees would be illuminated a dull electric blue for a split second, then right back to pitch black. They could see the rain dropping and the trees swaying with the wind with every flash. Then thunder would rumble and shake the boys more than they already were. And the screaming would fade out, before coming back just as strong. The grandpa stared out at the forest as the lighting struck, and said he swore he saw something walking in the swaying trees. It was impossibly tall. White skin, and long, lanky arms that reached nearly to the ground. He said it moved so fast he couldn’t make out its face. 

It was a strange thing. Its head clearly had antlers, and its feet seemed to have hooves. And yet when it moved, one could easily mistake it as one of the swaying trees in the forest. With each movement of its legs, and its arms reached back, mimicking the tree branches around it. The elder’s grandfather could hardly breathe. The other boys apparently had seen it too. There was no more whining or jumping. No crying or sniffling. The rain leaking through the leaves on the makeshift shelter that slowly soaked them didn’t even bother them. They were all paralyzed with utter fear as they all watched the thing appear with the lightning flashes and then disappear. The screaming all the time fading in and out with the wind. 

They stayed like that almost the entire night, clutching each other. Art some points the screaming would stop, only for it begin again right next to the shelter, the boys crying and begging or the thing to go away. Eventually, the rain started to slow down. The creature got more and more silent. Then there was calm at last. The grandpa had apparently managed somehow to fall asleep a little before dawn as the storm calmed down. He was the first to wake up. He poked his head cautiously and listened for the creature’s screams. When the coast seemed clear, he got out of the shelter without waking the other boys and started gathering their things. He was bending down to grab his camera, when he heard the screaming start up again. He turned and the creature was right next to him. His breath caught in his throat. He raised his camera and lifted the kodak's flap quickly to take a picture. The thing screamed and lunged for him, causing him to shout. The other boys woke up at this and they rushed out to see what was the matter. Luckily for the elder's grandpa, the thing seemed to have rushed past him into the woods. The boys wasted no time getting the heck out of those woods. They grabbed as much as they could and they left immediately, heading back to civilization. All the time they ran through the forest, they heard the screaming in the background, following them out of the forest. Painfully, eventually, they made it to their town. When they had gotten home, elder’s granddad had told his mother about what had happened. The other kids had told their parents, and the parents and members of the tribe made a stern rule that no one should go and camp out in the woods anymore without parental supervision. 

For many long years, the experience stayed with the elder’s grandpa. He had kids and had told the elder’s dad about the experience. And then his dad told him, and his grandpa also told him too. He wanted to tell his grandchildren every chance he could get. Don’t go into the forest alone. According to the elder, every once in a while his granddad would have him and his kids look out at the forest nearby the reservation on windy days. The elder said he could never be sure, but if he looked closely enough, some of the trees looked extra white. And they swayed and moved in ways they shouldn't have. He could swear one of those trees was walking. 

Apparently, the grandpa had kept that photo he had taken of the creature. He had it developed as proof of what happened to him and those boys. He used to show it to kids to warn them about making the same mistake. The elder showed us that picture to as he told his story. I have a picture of the photo here that the tribal elder let me take:

Now obviously, I have no idea if the elder is just yanking our legs. The photo could be fake for all I know. The story too. But, there are lots of similar stories about such run-ins with the Kashehotapolo. I don’t think I'll ever really know the truth. It can't hurt to take his advice and be extra careful in the woods around this reservation though. These people were living here long before we ever arrived here after all. And even if it turns out to all be a bunch of hoo-ha, you gotta admit, it’s one damn good story.
