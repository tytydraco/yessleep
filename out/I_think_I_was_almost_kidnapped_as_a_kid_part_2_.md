You may or may not know me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fgwass/i_think_i_was_almost_kidnapped_as_a_kid/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I know I left my last post without much explanation but there honestly isn't much for me to give. I tried commenting to give a little context but I've lived in the middle of nowhere all my life so please forgive me for not really knowing how this stuff works. 

My grandmother passed not long ago, before I could get any concrete answers. I do feel that her passing was my fault in some way. That I had somehow caused something to happen, like I gave her unneeded stress or something.

My grandmother took a bad fall just before she passed, she said she had been getting something from her attic and slipped on the ladder coming down. She had fallen a couple times in the past and always recovered fast so I didn't take it very seriously at first, but I think the combination of old age and the surgery was just too much for her to handle. Her health declined fast, every time I saw her she looked worse.

I was in my first year of college when she took that fall. I started to stay with her when she was released from the hospital and able to go back home, luckily my professors were understanding and emailed me the lectures and any work I was missing. She actually accepted using a wheelchair for once, so I moved the majority of her things from her bedroom upstairs to the spare room on the ground floor. Not only would she not be able to get up the stairs but her house was hard to traverse even while being able to walk, all the halls upstairs seemed too tight, I don't know who built the place but they must have messed up on measuring things. 

The box she had been getting from the attic was still dumped on the floor from her fall. I had seen it when I first arrived and was gathering things from upstairs. I had thought that nothing of it at the time, but I gathered everything back into the box and brought it downstairs with the things from my grandmother's bedroom.

My grandmother never wanted to eat after she had her surgery, at first she said it was just because she hated the food at the hospital. But even when she was home she still struggled to eat. I had resorted to making her soup, thinking that it would be easier if she could drink the majority of it, but it still went cold on her bedside table like everything else.

I wanted to ask her about the night I woke up at the creek again, I had been putting it off since I arrived. I didn't want to put too much stress on her with the state she was in. But I, selfishly, wanted answers.

“Grandma?” 

For a moment I didn't think she heard me.

“Yes?” Her voice sounded hoarse, as if she hadn't spoken in days.

“Do you still remember when I was a kid. When I uh, when I ended up at the creek?”

"Yes, I do... Don't worry yourself over things like that."

"How can I not worry though? All of it was so weird. From waking up by the creek to that guy showing up, it feels like it was all some dream."

There was a moment of silence, my grandmother staring up at her ceiling in a way that let me know she was deep in thought.

“That man.” She said, “That man…”

"That man is the devil himself. He is great and beautiful but he is not kind. He is not just and he is not fair! He is malicious and hateful like the rest of mankind. No matter what he says, he is the same as you and I."

“You’re… I don’t get what you're saying.”

“I know honey, I know. You don’t need to understand. He won't hurt you, that I’m sure of. However, he has a love for harming others. The ones you’re close to.”

“What?”

“Did your mother ever tell you what happened to your father?”

I felt like it was all getting a bit ridiculous. My grandmother had told me that she had an active imagination when she was younger, and she was a published author at one point, but it felt like she was just spinning me stories instead of actually answering me.

“She said he shot himself in on a hunting trip.”

“No… I met the man, as foolish as he was, he was not the type to take his own life on purpose or by accident. He was made to be a party favor. The main attraction is a twisted celebration of your birth.” 

“You say that like it’s a fact… How can you know if you weren't there?”

“I’ve witnessed it before. Your father wasn't his first victim and I’m sure he won't be the last.”

The whole conversation was pissing me off at that point. It was obvious to me that she was just making up some story to make things more interesting instead of just actually telling me what happened. But still, I felt a bit bad for getting upset in the first place. Her mental health was probably deteriorating along with her physical health. It was possible that she thought what she was telling me was the truth.

“You should get some rest. I’ll leave your food here in case you get hungry.”

I left the room before she could say anything. I didn't want to keep talking about it if she was just going to keep making things up. 

I wandered through the house as if I didn't know it already. It took me a while to calm down enough to decide to do anything productive. The stack of dishes I had made in my grandmother's sink made me feel guilty, she always kept things tidy, even though her house was always cluttered it was never actually dirty. 

The awning window above her sink gave me a nice view of the yard while I worked to clean up my own mess. It faced the back of the house, letting me see the well and the tree line just past it. The forest wasn't part of her property but I didn't know who it belonged to. It probably belonged to the state, but I could never find anything saying that it was a part of a park or any marked hiking trails.

I couldn't see anything beyond the tree line. It wasn't too far from the house, but it was like looking into murky water. I could see the first line of trees but not the ones behind them. Whatever was behind them was swallowed by the darkness of the forest even though the sun was still out. It was beginning to set, but it was still well lit outside, a warm gold hue making everything seem slightly orange. 

Once I finished the dishes I checked on my grandmother, made sure she was sleeping, and decided that I would go to the creek myself. It was getting dark at that point, so I had to find a flashlight to take with me. My grandmother had a surprising amount of dead flashlights, but a severe lack of batteries. It took me about 20 minutes to find a pair of batteries that weren't dead, but I wasn't sure how much charge the ones I had decided to use even had.

The air outside was still almost unbearably warm despite it almost being night, and for a moment I wondered if I should just put all this off until tomorrow. By the time I finished trying to decide if I would wait I was at the tree line, looking into the trees that still seemed far too dark.

Standing in front of those trees made me feel like I was a kid again, the trees still towing over me, the branches and leaves acting as a canopy to block out anything that would come from above. I held the flashlight tightly, my thumb rubbing over the rubber button. My palms felt sweaty, my stomach twisting in a way that made me think I might throw up. I took a deep breath and held it, reminding myself that the only reason I was scared now was because of how scared I was as a kid. I exhaled slowly, pointing the flashlight towards the trees and turning it on. The now illuminated deeper forest calmed me some. Now it wasn't some ominous inky blackness, but just a regular forest. 

The forest was denser than I remembered, and far harder to traverse. With every step I had to keep an eye on where I was walking to make sure I wouldn't trip on a root or fallen branch. Even with my flashlight it was hard to see where I was going, every tree seemed to move to block my path so I had to move around them and hope I wouldn't end up lost. It had been a long time since I went to the creek, and while I was confident before that I would have no issues finding it, I was starting to lose that confidence the further I went. 

I wasn't sure how long I had been walking for; I lost track after about thirty minutes, but after a while I noticed the beam of my flashlight starting to dim. It wasn't anything dramatic, but it was enough to make me notice after shining the light on a tree and staring at it for a few minutes. I smacked my hand on the back of the flashlight, the light flickering a few times before turning off altogether.

“Shit.”

I took the batteries out of the flashlight and put them back in, it seemed to do the trick. The light came back on and was slightly brighter than it was before, it dim, but it was better than nothing.

Dealing with the flashlight made me realize just how dumb all of it was. What was I even expecting to find? I had been walking for who knows how long and hadn't even found anything, I probably just went in circles instead of getting any closer to that damn creek. 

My thoughts were interrupted by a distant but joyful laugh. It could have been campers, or some dumb kids out here getting drunk. I followed the sound, hoping that I would find the people and they could get me out of here. I was already lost at that point, going deeper wouldn't hurt my situation. The flashlight shut off again while I was walking but I didn't try to fix it, it was likely that the batteries were dead, and the voice was loud enough at that point to where I could tell where it was coming from even in the dark. It was multiple voices, laughing and full of life, definitely some stupid kids.

The voices got louder and grew in number the closer I got. A light started to shine through the dense trees. I had heard of some people having bonfires when they got drunk in the middle of nowhere, but I haven't ever been to one.

I had made it to where I thought the voices were originating from. They had either found or made a clearing in the woods, a large circle of flat-ground with one large oak in the center. It was a bonfire, multiple piles of wood stacked and lit to provide an almost blinding light. They didn't notice me, too caught up in their fun to notice anything going on around them. 

There were maybe thirty people. Men and women shirtless and joined at the hands, pulling at each other in an almost violent manner. I recognized some of them, the gas station clerk, the bookstore owner, and multiple people from the church in the center of town. But some had their features obscured by a deep red paint that had caked to their skin. The tree at the center of their clearing was old and tall. A stag had been hung from the tree by his antlers, his back legs bent in a way to wrap around the trunk, his front legs tied to the branches so they were open and wide like someone waiting for a hug. The animal had been cut from his throat to his hind quarters, his guts laying in a pile underneath him. The animals glazed eyes stared at the hideously grinning people in front of him.

I stood frozen at the base of the trees. The people ahead of me paid no mind to their intruder, they danced and laughed. My unblinking eyes burned while I watched them, my throat stinging and dry despite the small amount of saliva I could feel dripping from my slack jaw. The blood rushed through my veins, simultaneously creating a deafening ringing and the feeling that I was being held under water. 

Then someone said my name. Faint and distant, but loud, like someone was calling for me a few yards away. 

I held my breath, waiting to hear it again. But the sound of the people and my own body made it impossible. Every sound I heard was overwhelmingly loud, threatening to burst my eardrums with every passing second.

Then it came again, closer. I could almost feel its putrid breath breathing down my neck, a heavy and overwhelming force weighing on my back. I flung myself forward, crumpling on the ground instead of actually jumping away from what was behind me like I had hoped. I scrambled to my feet, swinging my arm and the flashlight when I turned around. If anyone had actually been there then I would have hit them, but no one was there, there was nothing but the trees. 

My outburst caught the attention of the people, the silence was worse than whatever party they were having. They looked just as surprised to see me as I was to see them. They stared at me like I was the one who had done something wrong. Like I was the one who was acting insane. Like I wasn't meant to be there. I wasn't meant to be there. I wasn't meant to know what they were doing, no one was. This was meant to be a secret between only them and whatever malignant god encouraged them.

“Lucy. Sweetie…” A woman spoke to me but I could barely hear her, everything sounded muffled and faint. Her face was familiar, I had seen her multiple times when I would go to church with my mom, I had played with her kids when I was young. She walked towards me like she was trying to console a child, her hands reaching towards me. She came  too close too fast. She spoke to me in a soothing way, but I don’t know what she actually said. My hands came in contact with her shoulders before I could actually think about what I was doing, knocking her to the ground and leaving her looking shocked at me. 

I didn’t stay to see what she or any of the others would do at that point. I turned and ran, doing my best to stay on a straight course. I tripped on my way, slamming into the ground hard enough to blur my vision and make my nose feel clogged. My legs felt numb. I could hear noises behind me, leaves crunching, twigs snapping, heavy footfalls against the compacted dirt. Nothing was visible behind me when I looked, it was too dark to see anything, not even the moon gave any light through the solid canopy of trees. Could they see me?

Getting to my feet was easier than anticipated, but getting moving again felt impossible. My left leg didn't want to bend, it didn't hurt, but it felt cold. Dirt fell from my mouth while I tried to keep moving forward. I spit once, swallowed, and spit again. I couldn't hear them. 

The ground was at a decline, making it easier to gain speed. There was a breach in the trees ahead, a sickening white glow shining through. It was like an oasis.

It was a gas station. A truck pulled away from one of the pumps, flooring it onto the road and screeching to a halt a few feet away from me. The driver didn't get out, but they stayed where they were until I had completely crossed the road. 

“Welcome to Qui - OH FUCK.”

The greasy faced guy behind the counter wouldn't say anything when I tried to tell him what happened. It felt like he was ignoring everything coming out of my mouth, could he not hear me? Granted I think he may have been just shocked and confused. He did call the police, giving me the phone instead of trying to reiterate anything that I had told him. The dispatcher sounded just as apathetic, the sound of her rolling her eyes was almost loud enough to come through the phone. But she did send someone. A rotund and haggard looking officer who took an hour to arrive.

He was nice. The officer didn't ask me any questions, didn't even bat an eye when I asked if he was planning to look for the people in the woods. He demanded I get in the back of his cruiser with a kind of pathetic sort of intimidation. I did what he said against my better judgment though. I thought that he was going to take me to a station or something. But instead he drove me back to my grandmother’s house. I didn't even need to give him directions. 

He pulled into her driveway, leaving the car on and telling me to get out. I did. He pulled out before I had the chance to finish swinging the door closed, disappearing off down the road to god knows where.

The front door was unlocked, the lights still on in some rooms. The house seemed empty and silent, my grandmother was still in her bed where I had left her. Nothing looked like it had been touched or moved, but I made sure every door and window was locked regardless. 

My leg felt hot, a sharp pain starting in the middle of my thigh and shooting down to the bottom of my foot made it hard to walk. The cut wasn't too deep, but it was long, nothing I couldn't take care of with gauze and neosporin. Maybe some ice if it started swelling. 

I never checked the time when I came in. I had sat on the couch and propped my leg up on the coffee table, it was just barely starting to be light out. A faint baby blue started to coat the sky just above the tree line that was visible from the bay window. 

The house felt empty. I knew I was in it, and I knew my grandmother was in it. But I still couldn't shake that feeling. The sun rose completely, shining a blinding light through the window for a few hours before moving on. The house was empty. There were birds bathing in the fountain outside of the window. I had helped my grandmother set it up. The sun started to set, casting light in from the other side of the house. The shadows it made didn't look familiar.

It was almost dark. My grandmother had not gotten up. She hadn't made a sound. But I don't think I ever checked on her.
