All I wanted was a fresh start.

My boyfriend of five years had broken up with me. I was sick of the city, of seeing concrete and hearing sirens all hours of the day. And let’s face it, I could no longer *afford* to live in the city. My modeling career was dead. No one wants to hire a 36-year-old, unless you’ve injected your face with so much botox you can’t even smile.

So I picked up and left.

And that’s how I found myself moving into a room for rent at 13 April Lane. The ad had been posted by a woman named Elizabeth Hamfield. When I met her, we hit it off immediately. She was in her early sixties, I’d guess—but her brutal honesty and dry humor easily bridged the age gap between us.

“My husband died a year ago. Car accident. Smacked into a tree, and that was it.”

“I’m—I’m so sorry,” I offered, lamely.

She waved her hand. “Not your fault my husband was sexting his mistress while driving.”

I paled.

“Oh, dear, now I’ve made you uncomfortable. My momma always said I was too honest for my own good.” She stood up. “You want some crackers or something? Tea? Coffee? Booze?”

It was 10 in the morning.

“Uh, some tea?” I replied.

As she bustled into the kitchen, I took a look around. The home was elegant, in an old-timey way: exposed wooden beams stretched across the ceiling, and dark lines crisscrossed the windows instead of panes, matching the tudor style of the home. The place was immaculately clean, and the furniture was beautifully carved: even the coffee table in front of me had clawed feet.

My eyes fell on the family photos hanging above the couch. They showcased a little boy and girl. In the first, they stood in a treehouse, grinning. In the second, they wore their Christmas best, sitting between a much younger-looking Elizabeth and a man that was presumably their father. And in the third, they stood in front of what I recognized as Lake Tahoe.

Elizabeth swept back into the kitchen, carrying a mug and a few tea boxes. “Those your kids?” I asked.

“Yep!” She shook her head. “How time flies. Johnny is a lawyer in New York City, now, and Amanda’s finishing her sophomore year of college…”

She prattled on about her kids as I stared up at the photos. But as I stared—at the toothless smiles, the Christmas sweaters—I got a sudden feeling of dread in my gut. I couldn’t really explain why. A premonition, maybe. Or just the sound of my own biological clock ticking.

Either way, I changed the subject.

“So what kind of ground rules would you expect from a tenant?”

“Oh, just the usual,” she said, cracking open the boxes of tea. “No loud music late at night, or anything like that. If you’re going to have someone spend the night, I’d like to meet them first. And a few rooms are off-limits: my room, my office, and the basement.”

“Sounds reasonable,” I said, picking up a bag of Earl Grey and dunking it into the steaming water.

“Oh! And I almost forgot! The most important rule. Don’t take any photos inside the house.”

I stopped mid-dunk. “Huh?”

“With how crazy social media is now, I don’t want like, photos of my house showing up on Facebook, or going viral on TikTok, or something. This is my personal, private place, you know?” Her smile fell as she studied my face. “That won’t be a problem, will it?”

“I… I guess not,” I replied, taking a sip.

\*\*\*

A week later I was moving in. She gave me the room at the top of the stairs—a little room with a slanted roof, exposed wooden beams, and a defunct fireplace. “I haven’t had a roommate since college,” I said, as I came in carrying my box of clothes. “This is going to be exciting!”

“I bet it will,” she replied, with a twinkle in her eye.

Then I started up the stairs.

The room, for all its beauty, had a rather small closet. Stuffing my puffy jackets, glittery ball gowns, and endless parade of shirred tops was a challenge. *Maybe I should donate some of this stuff,* I thought, as I ran my fingers along a tailored blush blazer. *It’s not like I’m ever going to step in front of the cameras again.*

I grabbed the jacket and hung it from the hook on the back of my door. Then I stepped back, took a photo, and started an online listing.

*Oh wait… didn’t Elizabeth say I shouldn’t take photos inside the house?*

But the photo didn’t contain anything identifiable. It was literally just a white door with a jacket hanging from it. Nothing else. *There’s no way she’ll disapprove of me posting a photo like that… right?*

I posted the listing, threw my phone on the bed, and went downstairs. As I descended, the warm odor of garlic and oregano filled my nostrils. I turned the corner to find Elizabeth bent over an enormous pot of bubbling, red sauce.

“It’s been forever since I’ve had someone to cook for,” she said, offering me a smile. “Won’t you be a dear and eat some of my pasta?”

“Oh, I wouldn’t want to impose—”

“You could use some fat on those bones.” I frowned at her; she rolled her eyes. “In my day that used to be a compliment. I guess it’s ‘body-shaming’ now, huh?”

“Sort of, yeah.”

I grabbed a bowl and filled it to the brim with spirally pasta and chunky red sauce. “That’s *gemelli,*” she said, serving herself a portion. “An underrated pasta shape, in my opinion.”

“It’s nice,” I replied, not knowing what to say. I didn’t have strong opinions on pasta shapes.

Her sauce was actually really good. I wish I could say the same for the conversation, but Elizabeth bounced around a number of unpleasant topics, from her struggles with Amanda’s tuition to the rash on her back. At least she didn’t ask me about boyfriends or marriage or kids. Which is what I would’ve gotten if I’d taken up my mom’s offer to live in the basement.

She retired to her bedroom right after dinner. “Feel free to stay down here as long as you’re quiet. I’ve got an early morning doctor’s appointment tomorrow.”

So I stayed on the living room sofa, browsing through job listings, sending out applications. But every time I looked up, my eyes seemed to go to the family photos hanging across from me.

I got up, filled a glass with water, and leaned in to look at the photos. *I never wanted children,* I told myself, as I studied their smiles. *That was never part of the plan.* But looking at Elizabeth’s two kids standing in the treehouse, grinning, made me feel a pang of sadness.

*It’s not too late to change your mind,* said a little voice in the back of my head.

I stared at the photo. Trying to imagine what I’d be like as a mother. It would require a lot of sacrifices—but maybe they’d all be worth it, for those smiles.

I started to turn away—

And stopped.

*No.* I leaned in closer to the photo, my heart suddenly pounding.

There was an extra hand in the photo.

The older child—the girl—had her arm around the boy’s shoulders. But the boy, I could clearly see both his arms hanging down at his sides.

Yet there was a hand on the girl’s shoulder.

I scanned the photo, looking for evidence of another person. Maybe Elizabeth was somehow crouched behind them? But as I studied it, I didn’t find anything. Heart pounding in my ears, I looked at the next photo.

Elizabeth, her husband, and the two kids. They were sitting on the very same couch in front of me, dressed in their Christmas best. The girl had a bow in her hair and a long green dress. The boy was wearing a red-and-green plaid vest. Elizabeth looked stunning: hair rolled back, blue eyes shining, a string of pearls around her neck. Her late husband sat next to her, his receding hairline partially hidden by a Santa hat.

But there... next to Elizabeth’s shoulders…

Was a hand, hooked over the top of the couch.

My breath caught in my throat. I backed away, my mind struggling to make up possible explanations, but each one only got worse. *Maybe it’s a prank. Maybe Elizabeth is a Photoshop whiz and put an extra hand in all their family photos.*

*Maybe these photos were generated by artifical intelligence. They often insert extra fingers or limbs by accident, right? Maybe Elizabeth… doesn’t have kids at all.*

*Or maybe… there’s something supernatural going on here.*

I sucked in a deep breath and let it out. *Most likely a prank. It made sense, with her personality, that she’d enjoy freaking people out. That she wouldn’t realize it was in poor taste.* I picked up my computer and started up the stairs. Out of view of the freaky hands.

But when I got to my bedroom, something far worse awaited me.

When I picked up my phone, I saw that I had several *dozen* messages from the online selling app. I opened them up, one-by-one—but they all said basically the same thing.

*Whose hand is that?!*
