I don’t know about you, but I could never fall in love a slug.  I mean…honestly, why would I bother lying about that?  Nobody in their right mind would answer in the affirmative to a question about that.

“You mean you wouldn’t love me if I were a worm?”, she asked me again while I was trying to drive.  I guess I probably didn’t handle it very well, but I straight up said no the first time.  

“Why are you asking me about this?  This sounds like insecurity”, I said. 

“Can’t you go a little faster, this road is a 70”, she said.  

“Why are you on me so hard today?  What is going on?  Is this about the orange thing?”, I asked her, referring to her asking me to peel an orange for her this morning randomly.  

“Vince, you just don’t get it….”, she said finally while she stared out the window.  

I’ll be the first to admit, that I don’t know much when it comes to the dating world.  I feel like I’m always doing something wrong or apologizing to someone that I’m dating.  With Cheryl, it’s extreme.  Even this trip that she dragged me seemed like some kind of test.

“Sorry babe, I’m just hungry, I guess.  It’ll probably be an hour before we get to your parents”, I told her, trying to make up some excuse.  

“It’s important Vince, seriously.  Would you still love me?”, she asked again.

I think I snapped a bit at that point.

“Arg … babe, seriously.  Yes, but can we drop it?  I’m here driving you to your parents in my car on my day off per your request.  I didn’t even know you wanted to go see them this weekend until last night, but I agreed anyway.  Can’t you tell that I love you?  Why do you keep testing me like this?”

She didn’t answer me but just looked out the window as we drove by the monotonous scenery that was flowing by the window.  If it weren’t for the GPS, I’d be hard pressed to tell where we were.  

“Listen babe, I’m sorry.  I just get this all the time.  Maybe I’m a bit stressed out about work too.  I’m under a lot of pressure to make sure the safety features are compliant by the end of the week”, I said.

“What safety features?”, she said suddenly perking up slightly.  At least it looked like she perked up, but I was trying to keep my eyes on the road.

“Oh, it’s this new car model that they want to roll out.  Apparently, there are some design issues or something showing up.  I don’t know exactly but the supplementary data models I programmed show some serious flaws.  It would be a disaster if they released it to the public.”

“I thought you were like, a programmer.  Why would you do anything with that stuff?”

I looked over at her and tried to smile.  She was pretty, honestly.  I mean, some people might call her fairly average.  But I just feel, for some reason, I’m so lucky to have her here with me.  

“Yeah, but a lot of this stuff is all data modeling and reliability stuff.  I mean, at the end of the day, using actually dummies to test those cars is getting so crazy.  Each one of those things is like a million dollars.  Plus, the data from the models are more accurate.  It’s just a bit scary how much relies on what I do.”, I told her while putting my eyes back on the road.

“Oh, and one of the dummies has some kind of problem with its calibrating marker missing, or at least that’s what I overheard”, giving Cheryl way more info that she I would think she would care to hear.

“What is a calibration marker?”

“It’s like that yellow and black symbol on the dummies, it’s used for measuring things that happen during a crash.”

I looked over and saw her face turn ghostly white.

“It’s like the small tattoo that you have on your neck”, she said.

I laughed.

“Yeah exactly.  I got this tattoo years ago because I thought it looked pretty cool.  Didn’t I tell you that already?”

“Vince, I have one too on the back of my neck behind my hair.”

She tried to pull back her hair to show me, but I was trying to stay focused on the road.  

“No, you don’t have one, I would have seen that…. Wouldn’t I have?”

We both were quiet for a few minutes.  I didn’t know what to say or what that meant.  I know what you might be thinking.  Are we some kind of crash test dummies?  But obviously that couldn’t be case, we’re humans, with memories and feelings and thoughts and all that.

“Vince, can we pull over? I mean, if that’s okay.  I just want to walk around for a bit”, she said with her voice trembling slightly.  

I realized I was holding my breath.  I looked over at my girlfriend and her face was completely frozen in fear.  I’ve never seen her like that.  

“Oh babe, it’ll be fine.  Yeah, look I’ll just pull o….”

“Vince, watch out!!!!”, she screamed.  

I wish I could say that I didn’t feel anything.  That I just woke up later in the hospital after a successful surgery and was already on the road to recovery.  That I was surrounded by all my loved ones cheering me on as I opened my eyes slowly to sun beams coming in through my recovery room’s window.

But no, that’s definitely not what happened.  The impact was so sudden and violent that it produced a sound so excruciating that I’m sure at this point I would never hear again.  Some cars have safety features that emit a high pitch shriek or white noise before a crash to protect your ears.  Not this one though.  I couldn’t remember why we didn’t get one of those.

The first thing I could tell was that we were upside down.  There was glass everywhere.  One of the airbags failed, and I could clearly see that Cheryl wasn’t moving.  Her eyes just stared blankly ahead.

I could also tell that I was trying to speak, but no sound was coming out.  The pain was excruciating and all over my body.  I couldn’t see my phone but even if I could, but there was no way I could reach it.  The best I could do was wait for someone to call the paramedics or try to remove me.

That’s when I saw the flames.  They were small but getting bigger and bigger.  I could feel the heat beat against my skin even through the pulsating lightning strikes of pain that kept traveling through my body.  

I had never, in my life knew that such pain could happen to someone.  I waited there in agony while the slight crackling of the flames got louder. 

Then the howling started.  At first it was one shrill howl and then several more joined in.  

And they were getting closer.

At least my hearing wasn’t completely gone, I tried to console myself.

“Here they are, quick!”, I finally heard someone say from what sounded like a mile away. The howling stopped and was replaced with banging on sawing.  

I then heard some kind of absolutely horrifying grinding noise as something was slicing through the side of the car.  I felt myself being dragged out over sharp pieces of glass and road as I saw my right shoe and right paints leg remain in the car.

“It’ll be all right, buddy.  Hang in there.” Someone said as they flashed something in my eyes.

“He’s not breathing!”, someone shouted next to the person over.

I felt something crushing my chest over and over until I spit up something and gasped for air.

“Hang in there.  What about the other one”, someone said.

“The pain…” I tried to wheeze out.  If these guys were ambulance drivers or paramedics, they should have something for the pain.

“Pain is the patient’s problem, don’t give him anything yet”, someone behind the person over me said.

I was there on the ground for what felt like an eternity while they did stuff to me.  I’m assuming whatever they did was working because I started to feel my legs, even my right one, which I could have sworn was not there.

“It worked!  That’s so amazing”, one of them said.  

“Please …” I tried to say.  I was so exhausted.

“Oh one last thing, try this.  This should help you communicate better…”

It felt like he inserted something in my head.  I couldn’t tell other than the pain was unbearable.  

“Try to move this around”, the person said.  I could see they were wearing a non-descript paramedic type uniform.  I could also see that I was inside of an ambulance at this point.

I looked over to a laptop screen where I could move around a mouse pointer with no problem.  

“It worked!!!”, I heard someone shout, followed by what I could only assume were high fives being distributed around.  

I pulled up a text editor on the screen and typed out questions, like what was happening and where Cheryl was.

No one answered.  

I asked again and again and enabled the text to speech option, and raised the volume to max.  No way they could ignore that.

No one was answering. 

I tried emailing for help.  I emailed my family and friends.  I posted help on social media begging someone to come and. Help me, but no one is responding.  I don’t know what else to do, so I decided to come here and post this. I feel like I’ve been in this ambulance for days, and nothing is changing.  The pain is unbearable, and all I can do is test out things with this laptop.  

What else can I possibly try?

I guess at this point, maybe no one else is going to come, and I’m trapped her alone with my thoughts and the pain.
