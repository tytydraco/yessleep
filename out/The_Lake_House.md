Looking back on this weekend, I try to think of everything that we could have done to prevent what happened from happening. I remember it like it was yesterday, when it really began five years ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Are we there yet?” My sister whined for the fourth time within the hour from the backseat. I could feel my eye twitching as I let out an exasperated sigh, and my best friend chuckled from the passenger seat. 



“Actually Tara-” I went to answer her, but was cut off by her excited shouting at the fact that we were pulling right up to the house we’d be staying at for the weekend. It was summer time, mid-July, and I could feel my skin already growing bites on it as I brought the car to a stop. This weekend was meant for my best friend, Kelsey, and I, to get away from our stressful junior year of college classes, but my mother had other plans.



“Take your sister with you, she needs the outdoors!” She had said, already helping my seventeen-year old sister get her duffel bag filled with clothes for the trip. I was given no choice, and eight hours of driving later, we were here. My family owned a lake house down in Virginia, and I was finally given permission to go to it without any parents or relatives hanging around. I opened the car door, slipping out of my seat and making my way to the trunk to start grabbing bags. Kelsey followed suit, while Tara bounced her way over to the front door. She was a bit eccentric, some might say. A little bizarre, others might say. But she was still my sister, and I always loved her all the same, even if I wasn’t the happiest with her being with us this weekend. She had never been on a trip to our lake house; actually, I couldn’t remember the last time I had been here either.



I shut the trunk door, looking at the looming house with the sun at its halfway point for the day. Some shutters were detached from the windows, and vines had started to overgrow themselves on both the left and right sides, making the structure look smaller than it already did. *When was the last time someone had been up here?* I thought to myself. I shook my head, ignoring this small feeling of dread I had in the back of my mind. My mom didn’t have the spare set of keys, but she had said they would be under a flowerpot by the door. I shuffled my way over to the porch steps, carrying both Tara and I’s bags with Kelsey behind me. I glanced around the porch, feeling the wood creak under my weight as I stood in front of the screen door that was hanging on by an inch. There was no flowerpot in sight. I went to check my phone, but Tara beat it to me. “Mallory, I have no signal! How am I supposed to play any of my games?” She complained, shoving her phone into my face. She was right, no bars. Mom had warned me that we may have spotty connection at best, but Tara’s phone had a big X in the upper right corner, telling me there was zero signal.



“Well, there goes my plans on calling Mom about the spare keys…” I grumbled. Maybe the front door would just be unlocked. As if reading my mind, Kelsey handed her bag to me and creaked open the screen door. She jiggled the knob, then put some weight into it, and lo and behold, the door screeched open. 



“There we go!” Kelsey announced, looking back at me with a twinkle in her eyes. She was always the positive one in our duo group. No matter what went wrong in the day, she always found the one silver lining. Tara and I exchanged glances, and she pushed in behind Kelsey. I followed in, making sure to shut the door completely and lock it behind us. Turning back around, I took in our surroundings for the next two days. We were standing in what I assumed was the living room, with a large couch pressed against the wall; there was a television stand, but the TV seemed to be missing. I knew some of my uncles would come up here during their summers for hunting and fishing, but it was still hard to tell when someone had been here last. Further on, the living room connected into a kitchen to the left, and then a hallway on the right, which then branched off into two medium-size bedrooms. Kelsey and I would sleep in one, and Tara would take the other. I shivered, regretting that I had not put a hoodie on before we had gotten in. Even with the windows closed, there was a cool draft making its way through the single-level house. Tara had already claimed stake to one of the bedrooms as I heard her plummeting onto the bed. Kelsey and I made our ways into the one further down the hall, and I poked my head in.



There was a bed in the middle, a closet to the right, and on the left side was a window overlooking the lake. Kelsey grabbed our bags from me and sat them down, but I couldn’t stop looking at the bed. Not only were there a large, gleaming pair of antlers directly above where we’d be sleeping, but the bed was unmade. The comforter and sheets were tossed around, and one of the pillows was missing. “Oh Mal, I bet you one of your relatives forgot to make it before they left last time.” Kelsey spoke, noticing my hesitance. 



“Yeah…you’re right.” I acknowledged, shaking myself out of the stupor I had let myself get into. Knowing my family, she was most likely right. Also knowing my family, I could see why the front door had been mistakenly left unlocked. It still didn’t explain where the flowerpot was, but I shoved that thought out of my head. We were here to get away for the weekend; no drama, no stress, no unnecessary thoughts. I smiled at her, and she grabbed my hand to pull me back out into the hallway. Tara, hearing our footsteps, popped her head out quickly. “Are we eating soon?” She asked, looking at me expectantly for an answer. Kelsey answered before I could, “I’m actually starving!” Now they were both looking at me.



I laughed, making my way to the kitchen. “Let’s see if there is anything edible here; if not, we still have some of our snacks out in the car.” I made my way to the fridge, which was…surprisingly full. There were lunch meats, cheeses, lettuce, all the makings for a quick sandwich. The weirder part was that it was all fresh too. I turned to look at the girls, but they both shrugged.



“Maybe Uncle Alan was up here recently, it is halfway through Summer already, sis,” Tara commented. She was right. Uncle Alan was the one who normally spent a few weeks up here, but it was weird that Mom hadn’t mentioned that to me before leaving. I had been under the impression no one had been here for a while, given the state of the outside of the house. But, it further explained the bed situation and the front door. I nodded, and we got to work preparing ourselves some dinner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was half-past ten, the clock read to me as I laid in bed, waiting for Kelsey to get in from her shower. Tara had already turned in about an hour ago, claiming she was tired from the drive and wanted to see what games she could play on her phone that didn’t require reception. As I felt myself drifting off, I was startled by the door swinging open. Kelsey poked her head in with her cheesy grin, and jumped into bed with me. “Soooooo…did you come up with anything for us to do tomorrow?” She asked, rolling over and propping herself up on her right arm to look at me.



“I honestly hadn’t gotten that far, but I figured we could hang out on the dock since we brought our swimsuits and everything. I’m just craving peace and quiet at this point,” I replied, moving my pillow to make myself more comfortable. After that, we settled into our nightly routine that we had back at our dorms-making small talk and indulging each other with whatever was on our minds at the time.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I woke up with a gasp, feeling like the wind had been knocked out of me. Was it my dream that had given me a fright, or was it something I had heard? I grabbed my stomach, looking at the time. 4:45 AM…Kelsey and I had fallen asleep around midnight so it had only been a few hours. I rolled over to grab Kelsey’s arm and to move closer, but my eyes widened when I realized she wasn’t in bed anymore. *That’s weird…* I thought, *Kelsey doesn’t sleepwalk.* That chilling feeling of dread crept back into my chest again, and I crawled out of bed, making myself towards our bedroom door. I stopped for a second, listening, but all I could hear was my heart pounding and my breath coming out in short breaths. I opened the door, and popped out into the hallway, bracing myself in case Kelsey was on her way back from the bathroom.



To my despair, she wasn’t. The hallway was empty, and I glanced at Tara’s door. Tara snored, so I always knew what to listen for. There was no snoring this time though. I grabbed her doorknob and slowly turned it, holding my breath. When I shoved my head in quickly, I panicked. Tara wasn’t in her bed either. Were they playing a trick on me? It was late, but I could see those two messing with me as usual if given the chance. “Ha ha guys, very funny! Can we please go back to bed? I’m not in the mood.” My voice rang out through the hallway, echoing into the living room. I crept forward, listening to my shallow footsteps across the wooden floor. I paused again, straining my ears. What was that noise? It sounded like something was dripping…did we leave the faucet on?



Making my way into the living room, I stood there for a second, letting my eyes adjust to the dark. I had already blocked out how many hunting trophies my uncles had around the house, but it didn’t make them any less creepy at almost five in the morning. The dripping continued, but it was close. I turned to the right, looking at the small space before you’d turn into the kitchen. I made my way over there, the dripping getting louder.

*Drip.*

*Drip.*

*Drip.*

I immediately started to scream when I laid my eyes on what the source was. It was Kelsey, her body hanging from…antlers? A set of large deer antlers were stabbed through her chest, and her head and arms hung down, limp and still. “KELSEY!” I cried out, running towards her. I pushed myself under her body, trying to look at her face. Her eyes were wide open, but they were staring straight ahead. Nothing was left in there. Where the fuck was Tara? Before I could call out her name, I heard screaming, coming from outside. I bolted to the front door, trying not to acknowledge the fact that it opened immediately from being unlocked; I didn’t want to think about how someone had gotten in so easily when we had locked it the minute we stepped in earlier today. 



The screaming continued, and it began to feel like it was echoing throughout all the trees surrounding us. “Tara, where are you?!” I called, not even sure if my baby sister could respond to me. How could I let this happen? I pulled out my phone, honing in on the fact we still had zero signal. I started to panic, running down to my car. The screaming abruptly stopped, and I forced myself to choke down the tears. If I could just drive out far enough to get help, I could bring someone back here. I couldn’t save Kelsey, but maybe I could save Tara still. I flung myself into the driver seat and threw my gear shift into reverse, barely looking behind me as I flew back up the way we had come. All I needed was a bar, and I could call the police.



As I drove faster, my phone dinged. I slammed on my brakes and grabbed my phone, looking at the notifications that were piling in. I had a voicemail left from my mom, and my hands shook as I went to listen to it.



“Hey honey, I’m not sure if this will reach you…I think I gave you the wrong house number! It was 37, not 47. I’m sure you figured it out by now though when you saw the place and couldn’t get in, I know it’s been awhile since your uncles were there! Love you girls, I’ll see you when you get home.” My mom’s voice echoed in the car as my phone slid out of my hand onto the floor below me. Tears streamed down my face as my eyes glanced out the window, recognizing a mailbox on the left side. The numbers read 47.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was five years ago. My best friend and sister had been murdered, by some unknown assailant that they still have yet to catch. When the police finally arrived, I was in an uncontrollable state. I’m the one who hadn’t listened to my gut and taken the time to realize we were in the wrong house. They found Kelsey hanging in the same spot I had left her, and they found Tara’s body face-down, floating out in the water. I don’t even think that’s where he killed her though, because I never figured out where her screams came from. To this day, I’ve always questioned. Why me? Why did he leave me alive? The only sign I ever received to explain it to me was a year to that date, I came out from class to find a note on my car. It read, **I always like to leave my favorite alive. :)**
