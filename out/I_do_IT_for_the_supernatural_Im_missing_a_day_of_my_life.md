I was running when Eli called me. 

For once, it wasn't from anything supernatural. I'd simply pissed off the wrong chihuahua, the original inventors of fuck around and find out. 

I leapt a chain-link fence, thinking between gasps of air that I still had it, and tugged my phone out of my pocket. 

"Hey, Eli," I panted.

"Did I catch you at a bad time?" he asked. I could basically hear the smirk in his voice, the cock of his eyebrow. 

I laughed, "Nope. Just escaping a hellhound."

"Hellhound?" he asked, alarmed. 

"Oh god," I groaned, "Please tell me those aren't a thing."

I took his silence as my answer.

"No, it's just the neighbors chihuahua. They keep delivering my packages to them and when I go to get them, I'm terrorized by a 10 pound tyrant."

"I see," he said.

"Anyways. What can I do for you, boss?"

\---

Evans Arcade was one of the biggest casinos, if it could even be called that, in our town. On any given day, the flash of lights and the sounds of joy and despair could be found inside it's colorful rooms. 

A pair of gentlemen were already waiting for me when I pulled up to the polished entrance, hands clasped behind their back. 

"Good afternoon," the taller one said. He wore a white blouse and a dark blazer, along with plaid slacks and glossy black shoes. 

His associate wore almost the same, swapping in brown shoes and a caramel colored jacket. 

"Hi," I said, "I'm called Piper. I'm here to see Moira?"

"Of course. I am Harry, and this is Rombo," he explained elegantly, gesturing towards his partner. 

I tried very hard and almost succeeded in covering a laugh, instead disgusting it as a cough. Harry and Rombo. It sounded like a canceled prime time sitcom. 

"If you'll follow me?" he spun on a heel and Rombo and I plodded along obediently behind him. 

"Miss Moira is having an issue with one of her employees. Someone is stealing funds, but we can't pin them down since they're using a VPN. We need you to help us figure out who it is."

"Oh, sure, no problem," I smiled at his back, hoping he'd hear it in my voice. 

We travelled to a storeroom a few hallways in, and Harry led me in, pointing to a cardboard box of servers. 

"These are all our old servers. We just got them upgraded, but the company who did it weren't able to go over the logs from the old ones. We believe the culprit lies in this data," he explained. 

"Oh, uh, sure thing. Do you have a dolly, by chance?"

After showing me to a large warehouse down the hall, I plugged my console cable into one of the switches and logged in with the password. The passwords were written on the devices themselves and I cringed, even though that made my job easier. What do people think passwords are for anyways? Decoration?

I was halfway through downloading the traffic from the first one when the door creaked open. 

The only word that could come to mind when I saw the woman who walked through was 'elegance'. She was short, with dark buttery skin and natural shocks of onyx hair, wearing a golden romper and colorfully decorated sneakers. She strode in gracefully, her small hands moving smoothly with her swinging hips. 

Following her was a tall man wearing an outfit similar to the two men in the room with me, albeit a bit more scuffed up and a little less shiny. He had his hands in his pockets, and a smug look plastered on his rectangular face. 

"Hello," she said in a smooth, glossy tone, "I'm Moira. I own the joint. How's it going in here?"

I smiled up at her brightly from my seat at one of the tables before rising and holding out a hand. 

I felt raggedy in my black cargos and T-shirt, but she folded her delicate hand in mine and shook it, tracing electric amber eyes down my frame and back up again. 

"You can call me Piper," I said, releasing her hand and shoving mine back in my pocket, "I've got some data here and I just need to run it through my analyzer."

"There's no need," the man beside her took a step forward, "I'm the one you're looking for. It was going to come out eventually, if you care enough to hire a professional nerd to find it."

He smirked over at Moira, who regarded him with a cool expression.

"And it's somewhere you'll never find it. Not only that, but I've got friends in the feds, and they know exactly where I am, and who I'm with. Try to take me down, I dare you," he whispered those last words, leaning in towards Harry, who'd clenched his fists. 

"That's a shame, Antonio," she said, taking a step closer to him,  running her palms smoothly over his chest. 

He grinned and opened his mouth to respond but it was cut short by a sharp *fwang* sound. He looked down in disbelief and I found myself mirroring his expression. 

Moira's deep purple nails had elongated, become steep and silver. The blades had jerked right through his shirt and pierced cleanly through his body, thick oozes of blood dripping down his chest. Her soft smile never lessened as she jerked her hands downwards, slicing him into pieces in a second. A manic laugh bubbled in my chest as I likened it to cleanly sliced deli ham, clean cut pillars of meat except these ones were leaking with dark red goop and bubbling yellow cartilage. 

Her form grew huge, muscled. Her body morphed, effortlessly, into that of a large cat. Maybe a puma, or a black panther? Honestly, species classification was the last thing I was thinking about at the moment. 

She was a sleek, shiny black, her muscular shoulders twitching as she closed her monstrous maw around one of the slices of meat. 

To my horror, I heard her *purring* as she slurped what was left of Tony up, folding her paws together and lapping up every last drop of blood and crunch of bone. 

I was frozen in place, my heartbeat pounding in my ears, tracing a hard lump through my throat. 'RUN' my brain screamed. 'I can't!' my legs wailed in response.

After licking every last morsel from the ground, she smoothly transitioned back, once more the petite woman I'd greeted no more than a moment ago. It seemed like a lifetime now. 

Once she'd risen from her squat, her small nude form fully human again, Harry shot a meaningful glance at Moira, then to me and back, clearly asking a question. She simply smiled, wiping a drip of blood from her cheek and popping the finger in her mouth. She must have communicated to him telepathically, because he nodded upwards at me, motioning towards the doors. 

I slipped out of the room and immediately doubled over, taking deep gasping breaths to try to calm down, holding my quivering stomach. I wiped my forehead and mouth with my shirt and turned my face up, taking in a breath of cool air. The air out here felt so light and precious, or maybe I'd just been clenching my muscles so hard that I'd constricted my lungs in there, who knows. 

Harry pulled the door open and for a horrifying moment, I thought they'd changed their minds about letting me go, but he just slid the box of servers out with his foot, jerking his chin in the direction of the hallway where we'd found the storage closet. Then promptly slammed the door in my face, which I was grateful for to be honest. 

I grunted as I wrangled the box up and waddled it away from the warehouse door, trying to ignore the splashes of blood making the cardboard soggy. 

I was in the doorway of the storage room, fiddling with the handle when a flash of brown caused me to jump, almost dropping the servers. 

"Oh, Moira. Uh, hi," I stammered. 

"We have a problem, dear," she cooed. 

"Oh?" I asked, trying to shift the box comfortably on my hip. 

"How do I know you're not going to tell anyone what you just witnessed?" she asked, emphasizing the word witness.

"Oh, I'm very discreet," I said quickly, "You can ask Eli."

Annoyance shot through my wall of fear. If she hadn't wanted me to witness it, why didn't she have me leave first? I hadn't asked to stay and watch her mid-afternoon snack.

"Hmm, what if that's not enough?" she asked, batting her lush eyelashes up at me. 

"Oh, uh. I can sign an NDA, if you want?" I asked weakly. I was starting to get nervous, we were the only two in the area, stuffed together in the little alcove. What if she simply didn't want witnesses, no matter what? After watching her devour Tony, I was pretty sure the sanctity of human life wasn't going to be a very convincing argument here.

She placed a hand on my shoulder, lightly leaning her chin on top, mere inches from my face, and I tried not to let her feel me trembling. 

"Let's do this, then," she said softly, leaning her weight on my shoulder, "Let me take that for you? It looks *so* heavy."

As she spoke, she ran a fingertip down my clavicle, and I swallowed remembering those razor sharp claws. The curve of her lips was so sly, like the split-second when you touch ice and could swear you were burning. Like I was on the teetering precipice of possible damnation depending on exactly how I answered her question. 

"If you give that burden you're holding to me, then I'll know I helped you out too. You'll owe me a favor. Then, I'll believe you," she said, smiling sweetly. 

It didn't feel like I had a choice, but that might be an excuse. Looking back now, it feels ridiculous for me to have been so rooted in terror of this tiny woman, but the energy radiating off of her was debilitating. I've never been one to struggle with eye contact, but every time I lifted my gaze to hers, it was like getting punched in the chest. My heartbeat smashed loudly against my ribs, my blood beating out a manic rythym against my skull. 

There was no lust here, I wasn't shy or nervous, I was *terrified*. The last time I'd felt this pinned was when I met Arnie, an emotion bottom feeder who'd radiated dread like he was a 16 year old boy and dread was Axe body spray. 

I was shaking, both from fear and also from holding the box for too long. I weighed my options. What could I possibly be agreeing to by letting her carry it? Besides, when she'd sliced Tony, her claws had extended before I could even *blink*. With her this close to me, she'd cut my vocal cords out before I made a sound. 

How much debt would I be in for just letting her carry a box? Would I have to repay that favor? I shuddered at the thought of what deeds were too dirty for Moira not to just do for herself. 

She cocked an eyebrow, I had been thinking for too long. 

"Ah, okay. Yeah, thanks," I shifted my weight, letting her take the box from me. Sighing with relief when I didn't instantly become confetti, it was my turn to lift a brow as she effortlessly cradled the box with one arm, the other hand still tracing my collarbone.  

"That's almost insulting," I said, laughing at the image she made, casually balancing the 80 pound box I'd been struggling with like it were empty. She leaned away from me, smiling gently, so I hesitantly began to relax, when I felt a stab of sharp pain in my chest. 

I cried out softly, rubbing the muscle, thinking at first it might be a cramp. But as it got more intense, I fell to one knee, images flashing through my head. 

Scraping metal. Raining fire. Several intermingling screams, then the grunts of those screams being cutoff in the thud of impact. The shriek of splintered glass. 

The pain spread from my chest to my head and through my limbs, and I felt like a little kid getting sick for the first time. In so much pain while understanding it so little.

After a moment, I blacked out. I know they say that's bad for you, but with the amount of pain I was in, I considered it a mercy. As I swayed towards the ground, I heard her coo, "Good girl," and felt her snatch me around the collar, but fell into unconsciousness before she could lift me off the ground.

When I woke up, I was back in my truck, my duffel tucked neatly into the passenger seat. I felt like I must have been ran over with the truck before they put me in it. Everything was sore, and moving even to start to drive was agonizing. I felt like a wet sack of brittle sticks, a shaky scarecrow just trying to get back to my apartment. 

When I got there, I stripped and took a look at my body. Still disoriented, I checked everywhere I could for bruises or new scars, but found nothing. I was just as scarred when I walked in as when I was...carried out? I guess? With how she handled the box of equipment, I imagine she could carry me with one arm. I really didn't know if I should be comforted or extra terrified by that, but I put on comfy jammies, dropped into bed and passed right out, dreaming of cats with horrible sharp claws and scarecrows being ripped apart by them at the seams. 

I'll spare you the confusion I went through when I woke up the next morning with what I've pieced together so far. 

When I was a teenager, I was in a crash with my two young cousins. They were 10 and 11, and I spent almost all my time back then with them, playing or drawing or just talking about nothing. Their mother was driving under the influence, we crashed, and now I only have one cousin. It's not a very interesting story, just a deeply sad one, and before this happened, I probably would have said I'd LOVE to have those memories erased.

When I awoke, however, there was a pit in my stomach, feeling the gap in my memory. I knew there were pieces of my life that she'd taken from me, I just couldn't remember what. 

I can't stop myself from thinking now. Did I lose precious last words to my cousin? I don't know what I'm missing, but I feel it, a little space in my heart where a memory is supposed to be. 

I've figured out by now that it's exactly a day. She took exactly one day of my life. Why couldn't she have taken one of the hazy, forgotten days of summer childhood? Or a random Tuesday when I worked retail when nothing happened of note? Why did it have to be my worst, most painful memory? The absence of it almost pulls my attention towards it more, the itchy tag of something not being right. 

More importantly, how was she taking a burden from me? Did I do something that caused the crash? The thought sent a shock of anxiety shooting through me. I don't remember feeling a massive amount of guilt. And I still have to live without one of my favorite people, so it's not like she took the burden of grief from me. 

I spent all of the next day in a funk, before deciding I couldn't live this way. I decided I had to go back. Surely there was something I could do to barter back for my memories? Something else she could take. I was in tears at the thought of missing even one picture of my cousins face in my mind, with the knowledge that I'd never make another one. 

This is getting pretty long, so I'll tell you how that visit went next time. 

Until then, hold your loved ones and your memories close, and remember...
