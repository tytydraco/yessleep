Remembering the spirit of a place, that can be hard to do when it isn't the same anymore. There would be a kind of mist, a sheet of white draped across the trees surrounding Highland Park. It was a perfected landscape that received the light of dawn, amid a chorus of sprinklers.

I've kept these grounds, kept them in a state of Eden. I've kept this, an oasis of civilization, a triumph and a monument to Man's sophistication. The golfers were nothing less than my saints. My duty was nothing less to me than liturgy to this cathedral of beauty and order.

Something comes, something tears across the turf. It gallops on three, it is hunched and loping, howling in the darkness, a beast without words. This is the mishappen thing in the night. This is the entrance of contamination, of perversion. It is an intrusion by the obscene, where the perfect exclusion is serene.

Where I work, covering the course, I then saw it. A glimpse of the awfulness, the not-human thing, the work of cruelty. In the early morning, in the hours when light is liminal, and it is neither sunset nor night, but something suspended between the two, that is when it moves. I saw it moving, when nothing else moves, when nothing else is seen, in that invisible stillness.

When I found the body, I could see the violence in the way he lay sprawled. Too much of him was outside, everywhere around him. There was a brokenness to the contortions of his body, with too many elbows and knees, too many directions he seemed to be facing. I was shocked, for this golfer was Marcus Gaily, the leader of the four senior golfers of the club, a judge, a great man.

The investigators suffered my eavesdropping, for I had to know what they thought. What, not who, could have done this? They seemed to think it was a person, but I could not understand how the killer could be a person. No person could take a man and break him and tear him like that.

Jan Hunter, Rude Goss and Henry Viscous were all part of the judge's little gang. They had ruled the greens every Sunday for over half-a-century. That these were all mighty men, great men, important men, I had no doubt. They were, at the time of their deaths, the golfers whom I served, by keeping Highland Park for them, to honor their magnanimity.

He'd stayed late at the clubhouse, much later than I, and he'd had the course as his garden, to muse in the moonlight. That is when something awful that should not be, took him from us. His slaying was not random, it was the work of the devil, to darken the world.

This was the nature of my mourning, but I shall come to know the nature of Nature itself.

I pray that God forgives me for telling this story, for this is the work of the real universe, the one beneath the uniform grass and timed sprinklers. It is not truly my place to say, but I say, and I say what I must.

I was left with the shock and disturbance of a realization, one that challenged my world view, horrified me and broke me. I will explain briefly what I now look through, knowing what I see, in the past, with this new thought:

In Nature, there is a natural law. The natural law is greater than the laws of Man, because God wrote the laws of Nature. In nature, the first law is written on all creatures, for all creatures must be killers to survive. The first law is "Kill or be killed." and it has always written this way, by the hand of the same God who made this universe.

This is a universe where everything ends in death, and death can only be avoided by killing. But what is death, is it merely the extinction of the body, or is it something else entirely? Perhaps there is a second death, a greater death, and that is what drives the vengeful to kill. The legacy of the avenged can only be preserved through the extinction of those upon whom vengeance becomes the will of God. Nature is the will of God, and nature says "kill".

I cannot believe this is the way, or I could not. There is a horror, a revelation, but I must explain what else happened, and then the horror of what I learned. It turns out that civilization is a lie, and each death made a cardinal claim, a corner of that argument, and by the time they were all dead, and the investigators had no leads, no clues, I realized there is no such thing as civilization.

Just animals dressed as men.

I can hardly continue, but I must, I must piece it all together, so that I may forget, so that I might be done.

It was later in the summer when Jan Hunter was alone, on the course, just after sunset. The last person to see him, I cannot understand how this could have happened. There was nobody else at Highland Park, he was alone.

His death was similar, but instead of the outlet of rage, the ragdoll with stuffing blown out everywhere, he was crumpled and stuffed into an old caddy's cart bag, with Jericho Lanny's name on it.

Jericho Lanny was a young prodigy. They actually called him that 'The Prodigy', a very young man who also worked as a caddy, and was destined for greatness. His golfing skills were already comparable to the masters, when he first started, he was just a font of uncanny talent.

Then he vanished. Here, on this same course, he just disappeared. Nobody ever knew what happened, but the judge and his friends claimed he must have given up on golf and gone become a vagabond, addicted to drugs, and other strange speculations, all of them disrespectful to Jericho Lanny, all of them certain he was finished and never coming back.

A beast of extraordinary strength and anger had killed Jan Hunter. I suspected Jericho Lanny was still alive, and had become this beast, it was just a thought. I couldn't say it out-loud, it was still more of an instinct. The police had no suspects, the investigation made no connection to the previous killing.

To me it looked identical. Perhaps I should have found myself alongside the investigators. In that version of things, the last two men might be saved, and the killer stopped. I already had a clue.

Rude Goss was found with his back broken, his limbs torn from their sockets and his head kicked down onto a sprinkler so that the metal spike of the plumbing protruded from his mouth, the gospel of watering the lawn. I found him too, and at this point, I was brought in for questioning, as I had found all three bodies, and this time I had no alibi.

The investigators asked me many questions, but none of them were about Jericho Lanny. They satisfied themselves that they had made another mistake and moved on. Investigators must be humble people, to succeed in their line of work. They had to admit they were wrong at least eleven times for every time they are right, it would seem. That's something they mentioned, when I asked them a question about how many suspects they had.

I'm not sure what species of interrogation rhetorically allows the prisoner to ask a few questions of their own and expect any sort of answer. That's what I experienced, and I later understood that the investigators were not as dumb as they seemed. They knew there was some kind of connection to me, long before even I could understand that.

Jericho Lanny was the master of the course that summer, and the killings changed the landscape. The choir of angels that always hummed in the background as the golfers gloriously enjoyed the green Sabbath has gone silent. The blue skies turned gray, the mists became shadows and there was an odor, a malodor, a rotten smell that permeated everything.

The clubhouse felt deserted; the sound of teeing off was no longer ambient, but expected of the few golfers who were ignorant enough to arrive. Ignorance is temporary; it only feels permanent because it is ubiquitous, and in that way, it will always be with us.

When the ignorance was spent, there were no more golfers. Three horrific killings were more than enough to put an end to the church of grass. I stared at an inspirational poster of an animatronic gopher urging fun over accomplishment, in its abstract slogan.

My eyes blurred and I couldn't read it. I thought I was alone on the course, but somehow, something had lured Henry Viscous out there in the night, despite the killings. I ran to help him, I'd heard his screams and cries for help.

When I arrived, I saw the killing with my own eyes. A half-faced thing with one bulging red eye and a twisted mouth and socket nose held him up. It brought him down, using its one elongated and thick arm and its twisted, scrawny arm with balanced, herculean strength. Then the monster brought the man down across its own leg, propped up from the ground. I heard a sick, wet, crunching snap as his spine shattered. His agonized scream chortled into a gurgling wheeze and then he was just a bag of flesh and bones being reformed by the night artist.

It slammed him around, bashing him into things, tossing him, rolling him, ripping off one of his arms and throwing it away. Then it stopped, breathing out huge clouds of rancid breath, and it turned and looked at me, and the light shone white across the one bulging eye, and in the shadow of its face, the other eye was yellow and backlit with cold fury.

The monstrous thing knew me and stared for a long time. I realized, gradually, that I was just standing there, trembling in some kind of primal fear, but I had not yet known true horror, not yet experienced pure horror. I could hear police sirens. Someone else had heard noises and called the police, and they were coming.

Jericho Lanny bounded towards me, his work, his 'God's Work' was done. The awfulness I shall not name, became my world. And I was taken in that impossibly strong embrace, under the one great arm, into the world below.

The door of a tunnel, left over from the construction of the course, where there is plumbing, electrical wiring and machinery down there, was open. We went down into the tunnel, and through the darkness. If Jericho was going to kill me, he would have, but I was not a victim, I was a witness.

I think, after what I learned, that the witness is much harder to suffer, than the man torn to pieces by a monster, a victim who enjoyed ignorance.

I was dropped in the pitch black of some kind of cavern. Yes, there are limestone caverns under the golf course. While the land above is tame and lovely, it is built on ground suitable for little else. The tunnels were drilled through, connecting caves, and then when it was done, they closed the cellar door and locked it, and nobody ever comes down here.

In the chamber, I learned my gibbering captor still possessed some power of mimicry, and that is where the horror began. While Jericho Lanny had lost the power of speech when he mutated into some kind of awful parody, he still retained some power to imitate human dialogue.

I heard the voices of the dead. I heard each victim speak in turn, the judge and each of his friends. They were not saints, they had left Jericho Lanny for dead, presuming he was.

He was too good; they had to put him in his place. The hazing had gotten out-of-hand, and they'd left him smashed and torn in the world below, certain he was dead, after they'd pushed him onto the sputtering machine, its parts whirling relentlessly.

They spoke from beyond the grave, their exact words, their voices, stolen by the monster in the darkness.

Here, he had recited the moment again and again. He was like a recording of it, echoing in the dark, obsessive and divine. For me, he repeated the ritual one last time.

It was not enough to kill those men, the beast had to show me that they were not men at all, and that he was no beast. They had created this monster, they were not saints.

I moaned in rejection of the horror, but I knew it was true. It was like I was there, hearing them speak about leaving Jericho Lanny for dead, and agreeing to keep it a secret. To lie, and leave him there to rot in the darkness while they continued to play in the world above, as though they had done nothing wrong.

The men I had served and adored were the monsters.

I screamed when the thought became an irreversible fact. I recognized the void of the black hole behind the white of their teeth, mouths filled with chaos and murder. They were liars, killers and petty.

Dedication to beautifying their environment, it made me something I could not be.

When the police arrived, they found me temporarily insane, and unable to say that it was Jericho Lanny. I wish I could have calmed down, but I was broken, and I was not myself.

I was never the same again, I am this way now, the way I am. I am different, I only remember who I was, what it was like, but I feel nothing.

Jericho Lanny was finished, having lived in a broken body of pain and never-healing-wounds, a body of sores and filth, and a mind of a revenant, alive only to prosecute its revenge. It was no longer a galloping shadow, a hulking nightmare, a thing from the world of monsters. Just a broken man who was still alive, but was ready to exhale, and rest.

The police didn't know what they were doing. It was a natural reaction, to seeing something like that. The police are just dogs, and dogs bark. The salvo of gunfire shredded the creature, and it fell back down into the darkness. When they looked for it, there was a thin trail of blood leading deep into the caverns, far below. The body was never recovered.
