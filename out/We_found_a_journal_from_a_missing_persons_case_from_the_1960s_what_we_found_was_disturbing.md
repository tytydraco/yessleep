Hello r/nosleep, I am a park ranger for the Appalachian trail, I basically go around helping people that call our station requesting help back or finding missing people. around a week ago I found a journal containing logs from a missing person from 1960. The journal is pretty messed up so I can't write down some of the logs, so I will write as much as I can. Last names will be cut out to respect the privacy of the family.

May 13th, 1960 - Day one of my camping trip is on, my name is Daniel \[REDACTED\] I am currently away on vacation from my job as a journalist for my town's local paper, and currently writing this journal so that my daughter can read about the trip I am on. Today I set up camp roughly half of a mile off the trail to catch some peace and quiet from all the tourists on the trail. Nothing interesting happened today besides catching a glimpse of a giant moose on my way to set up camp.

May 16th, 1960 -  I ran into a couple of hikers today, they were wearing some really baggy clothing and had what I could only assume to be a bottle of ink. I shouted at them with a friendly hello to try and get their attention but I only got some side eye and quiet. Something felt off about these people; they were oddly quiet and almost made no noise even though there were thousands of leaves and twigs on the ground.

The next couple of pages were badly water damaged and hard to read so I could only get a couple of words out of each entry.

May 19th, 1960 - … screaming far away … snapping sounds too dense to be twigs …

May 21st, 1960 - My dried meat was taken, must’ve been those bears i saw earlier … It's getting cold and I can't find my jacket.

May 23rd, 1960 - Something has been circling my tent for an hour, footsteps quiet but the thick branches I set outside are getting smashed within seconds, whatever this is it’s toying with me … Whatever this thing is, it stopped and it's standing over my tent. I can hear it breathing as I write this.

May 24th, 1960 - Whatever this creature is, it ran away after I heard howling in the distance. Maybe it's scared of the coyotes or maybe it's hungry. I'm going to rest for a little while. I'm scared but I can't do anything if I don't get enough rest.

May 26th 1960 - yesterday I decided to go outside and find my way back to the main trail however I found something much worse. I found those hikers that I met a week ago and I'm glad I didn’t interact with them anymore than I did that day. I found the group of people laying In a circle, their throats slit and eyes missing. I wanted to puke but I ran out of food from that animal that ransacked my cooler. I ran back to my tent processing what I had seen. It was almost demonic in nature, maybe it was a summoning ritual. Whatever it was, I need to leave as soon as I can. 

May 27th 1960 - I caught a glimpse of the creature or whatever this thing is circling my tent, Its limbs were facing all different direction and were abnormally long it neck was as long as my forearm, its face was all fake looking almost like a dried piece of pig skin, and that smile, that damn smile its mocking me it's having fun with me…its asking for help it sounds like there are thousands of voices asking for help.    

The last entry doesn’t have a date, it's just the words “god save us all” written hundreds of times seemingly made out of dried blood. Along with the journal were some bones and teeth that seem to be human. We got dental records from the teeth about a week later and it confirmed our suspicion it was Daniels. One of the other park rangers had something even more odd to report when they came back with this journal, he reported to hear cries for help coming from the brush around the area where the journal was found. The ranger said nobody responded when he asked if someone was there so he left. The only bad thing from this is that now I hear noises coming from outside the ranger station and if this creature Daniel encountered is real then god save us all.
