I used to work as a caregiver for old and disabled people in a nursing home. That never was my dream but I landed that job and the pay was good, so I decided to work there for a little bit.
 

One of the people staying there came for a visit in my office every sunday. I don’t want to violate his privacy so I’ll just call him Ray. 

He lived there but we agreed to talk about things every sunday so he doesn’t feel so lonely.

Ray was an old man who loved life and philosophical thinking. He was very caring and thoughtful of other people. He also was nearly blind. 

In his 20s, he was blinded by a solar eclipse. Back then people didn’t know the risks of looking at one directly and without protection.

He had a guide dog and he was a handsome German shepherd. The dog's name was Chucky. 

Ray loved that dog very much but he sometimes complained about the dog talking at night when he tried to sleep.

I never believed him until one night I heard Ray talking with someone at night. 

This happened when I was just about to leave from work. 

“Shhh, someone might hear you and I’m starting to get annoyed from you speaking,” Ray whispered.

“Ruff Ruff,” 

Barking, at this time? Chucky never barks and that told me something was off.

Then I had to go ask Ray about his dog. I walked to his door, knocked and waited for him to open the door. 

“Who is it?” Ray asked from the other side of the door.

“Oh, it's just Travis. I heard Chucky barking, is everything all right in there?”. I asked

“Everything is alright, young man. Chucky just got a little excited, that’s all” Ray said.

“All right Ray. I’ll go home now, see you tomorrow” I told him and left.

On the walk home I kept thinking about this whole situation. Ray was talking to his dog. Did he go crazy? 

Anyway I was tired so I went home and cooked myself a meal. Then I went to sleep. 

As soon as I fell asleep I began seeing a horrible nightmare, I saw Ray and his dog Chucky talking about something. 

Then I moved closer. That’s when I see chucky in a different form. He wasn’t a dog anymore but I couldn’t quite figure out what it was, not yet. 

They were talking about escaping from the nursing home and going to find Ray’s wife and kids.

I didn’t know that Ray had a family. 

Then I woke up with the sun burning my face. It was all a dream. Ray’s family, Chucky talking and shapeshifting. 

That day was really weird. Everything felt bizarre and I felt like I just discovered some secret and this happened because of that dream.

The dream felt too real. 

Anyway I went to work as normal and the first thing I always do is check on Ray because he lives in the first room. After that I usually check  all the other people staying there.

On this day I was the first to enter that building and I changed into my work outfit and then went on to start my tour. 

“Ray, are you in there?” I asked. 

“Go away,” Ray said through the door.

“I can’t, it is time for your daily morning checkup,” I told him. 

I thought he just forgot and opened the door. 

That’s when I caught a quick glimpse of Chucky the dog standing like a human. 

Ray was laying in the bed and he looked terrified but remained calm.

I blinked a couple of times, I couldn’t believe what I saw. I was questioning my own sanity and no it didn’t look like a dog normally would when standing on two feet.

As soon as my eyes locked on Chucky, he looked back and went back into a normal dog pose. 

“Ray?” I asked nervously. 

“Yes?” Ray answered.

“What were you two doing in here?” I continued to ask my question.

“Ohh, nothing. Chucky just likes to stand up and look out the window,” Ray answered and laughed it off.

When those words came out, I knew he was lying. He lied to me about Chucky standing. This was the first time that I saw Chucky acting weirdly but not the last.

The next day I was sick. When I woke up I felt like shit. 

Every now and then, I woke up from my fever dreams. 

I kept having this same nightmare of Ray’s dog turning into a skinny, old man with hollow eyes.

His gaze made me freeze every time and his eyes looked soulless.

Then Chucky sliced open Ray’s throat with his bare hands. I tried to scream but I couldn’t, there was no sound coming out. 

His long, claws-like nails glistened in the dark while blood dripped on the ground. Then Ray started choking on his own blood. 

There was so much blood and the air was filled with this smell of rotting flesh and fresh blood.

Then my alarm rang. I jumped up from my bed and looked around. I was dripping in cold sweat but I wasn’t sick anymore. 

Then I thought about that dream, it was one of the weirdest dreams ever and I couldn’t forget it.

At that moment I realized that I’d have to meet Ray again. I’ve never felt that way about meeting someone. The dread and fear almost made me vomit.

These nightmares that I kept having felt real, too real.

I faced my fear and drove to work. Immediately after arriving, I see an ambulance driving there. My co-workers were outside and looked shocked and horrified. I still remember that look on their face. 

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“I don’t know but Ray was found murdered and Chucky has gone missing.” Karolyn, my co-worker answered.

Karolyn looked shocked, she couldn’t stop crying hysterically and she was shaking uncontrollably. She told me it was her first time seeing someone murdered like that. 

“What happened to him?” I asked shockingly.  

“He was found laying in his bed with his throat sliced open. The wounds were deep but Chucky had disappeared,” Karolyn said while sniffling. 

I can’t even imagine what she was going through. Seeing Ray dead by deep gashes on his neck. That must have been traumatizing. 

I comforted her and told her to go home and get some sleep, after all she had worked the night shift. 

Ray’s body was taken away and I never saw it again. I didn’t want to. I didn’t need to.

That shift was weird. Every person in that nursing home acted strangely and I could feel that something was terribly wrong. 

The sun set and after it was dark, I went to check Ray’s room. There was police tape on the door. 

A foul stench hit me as soon as I stepped in that room. The bed was all bloody and some of the walls were scratched. 

I checked everything but it was already searched by the police, so the place was pretty empty. 

Then I noticed that the window was unlocked. After noticing that I started to drip cold sweat. 

I opened the window and saw a pair of eyes, staring straight at me. 

Those eyes looked like they weren’t human but they still looked familiar, like I had seen them somewhere. They glowed in the dark. 

There was someone in a bush, just stalking me in that room.

I glanced behind me and looked out the window again. From that bush an old man emerged. He had a scruffy beard, hollow eyes and he was really really thin. 

He walked straight towards the window and just as he was about to grab it, I got the window locked. 

“Go away.” I tried to scream at him through the glass.

He just barked at me a couple of times. A few angry, raspy barks and I could feel that he was angry. At this point, I had 15 minutes left of my shift.

I met his hollow and feral gaze. Then it started to show his teeth and I could hear him growl.

I saw that his nails were really overgrown, they were long and really sharp looking. 

I left the room and called the police about a drug addict harassing me at the nursing home. 

The operator told me to hang up and I did. That’s when I remembered my dream, the dream with this exact same thing happening.

The police arrived and I told them what had happened. Then they searched the property. They couldn’t find anyone or anything in there. 

They told me to call them if something like this happens again. Then they left and I was left alone. 

The next shift worker had already arrived while the cops were searching and I told her what had happened. 

I almost didn’t want to leave her alone because she had just started and this type of thing was scary to face alone but I was exhausted from everything that had happened, so I left to go home. 

I arrived at my car and froze. My car was all scratched up. There were some letters scratched on my car. 

“You are next” 

I looked around but didn’t see anybody, quickly hopped in and drove off. 

On the drive home, I couldn’t shake this feeling of someone following me and it made me freak out a little bit. That day was so full of stress.

Stopping at a red light, I looked out my rear view mirror. I swear I could see a silhouette of someone, watching me from behind a trashcan.

The light turned green and I sped up. Then that silhouette stepped in the middle of the street.

I could see that it was the same old man from earlier and he was waving at me. The rest of the drive home, I kept glancing at the mirrors constantly. I was paranoid of that man following me home.

After that I had to get out. I was so shocked and terrified of the events that I even moved out of that country. 

I hope that I’ll never have to experience anything like that again. Ray and Chucky still visit me in my dreams sometimes. 

I’ve heard of people talking about seeing a skinny man wandering around this town at night and scratching outside of their homes. I hear that same scratching now, wish me luck.
