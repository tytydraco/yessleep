Love. It’s a strange thing isn’t it, I mean you can ask what the hell even is love. Science describes it as a mix of hormones and signals in your brain causing the feelings of it to come out and give a physical biological response. Does that make it a need for survival. Is ,love just something that is embedded within not only our cultures are our biological makeup. Did god, or evolution or whatever the fuck made us want it to be that way. If so, why does it hurt so much why does it burn away at your insides and make your brain foggy and confused and in need of this thing you just cant seem to grasp. I have my own beliefs about love, it’s not some thing everyone should strive for, it’s a poison. A deadly poison or curse or something I don’t know, all I know is this god forsaken feeling is driving me insane, and I need to get it out or find a cure, or a way to break this curse that has shackled me in place and is controlling my actions, I need help.

She’s there waiting for me, that girl, the thing that has been the root cause of this, the way she looked at me the way she spoke the way… Fuck just everything about her, it attacked me I don’t know how else to describe it the things they sank deep into me like the claws of some rabid hungry animal whose finally found something to eat after a long gruelling hunt, and this animal , the venom it produced has sent me down into a rabbit hole of obsession, her eyes, her voice, her smile, whatever is in me needs it to live it needs it and I know she needs it to, maybe she doesn’t know it but I do, the moment she gave me that first look I knew this is a disease that is not so easily cured. Maybe I should go see her, I mean if I feel this strong about it I should, right? Would it be wrong for me to want to see her again? Yeah, I’ll find out who she is maybe then I can be free.

I can see her again finally, shit how long have I been staring at her, maybe no one’s noticed I mean yeah surely no one has the bar is packed, no one would even be able to tell that I was here, I’m just quietly in this corner, alone, gazing into the abyss that is the temptress, this pinnacle of human evolution, I mean surely she has to be of a divine creation right only God himself could have created this woman she is perfect and I need her, there it is again that feeling, that fogging of my mind that she brings the it I’m able to just forget and ignore everything but her.

“Sir, are you okay” a voice breaks my gaze, something impure not anywhere near the level of perfection she has,

 “Sir, I’m asking Are, You, Okay” the voice repeated

“Oh W-what, Um, uM, y-yeah I’m fine” I stagger out my stupid voice barely able to talk.  

“Okay well ill need you to buy a drink if you want to stay cant have someone just loitering in my pub either get something or please leave” the man said, What a cunt must be the manager or something, but I guess yeah he’s right ill get a drink, I mean she’s behind the bar isn’t she ill be able to hear that melody of a voice that she has again yeah ill get a drink, For Her, Ill do it for her. 

I’m at the bar I can see her even closer now and I was right she’s an angel, a true creature of God and I have been ensnared in her trap, but I can’t do I can’t say anything nothing is coming to mind her venom is still infecting my brain and it hurts I need the pain to stop, it hurts so bad and I need it to stop I need that drink a different fog to soothe the pain in my head I need it but words can’t come out I can’t ask her I, I… I run, I run to my car and hide this girl is perfect and I can’t have her, so I run and hide from her hoping the pain in my head goes, the pain that she brings, that curse that is called love.

Why, why does it have to feel like this. I can’t believe any description of things like cupid being an angel, a cherub; if this is the effects his arrows give then he must be born from the burning pits of hell, he is Beelzebub he has to be a demon of lust whose cursed me in order to weaken me what will happen to me why wont this pain stop I need to be free from her, NO… I need to see her, I need her to be mine, she has to be mine she must be mine. I will find a way for her to be mine. I’ll give into whatever this demon cupid has done to me Ill believe in this feeling he’s given me, maybe I’ve been possessed by him I don’t know all I know is I need this girl and then the pain will stop, it’ll stop when I know ill have her in my life when she is, *only mine.*

Shit how long have I been in my car, wait I can see her leaving she’s, she’s there but somethings wrong she is walking with someone, how can she be walking with someone she’s mine she doesn’t belong to whoever that is, maybe she’s in danger maybe he’s trying to hurt her, I should follow her, make sure she’s okay ill stop anything bad happening to her, shell see how I can protect, yes that’ll work I can make her mine by doing that. Left, left, left, why are we walking in circles, I’m almost back to my car, something is definitely wrong I should step in, yes I should, I can see them running, she’s clearly being chased by that man I, I need to help I should run to and stop him from hurting my angel, I will protect her, I must protect her.

Fast, he’s fast but I’ve almost got him, ill catch him and save her I must save her, I jump, and we hit the ground hard, his head smacking into the concrete, blood spilling from his head onto the cold floor “RUN!” I scream and from below a lower quite timid voice speaks “run”. I don’t understand, why is he telling her to run he’s the one who is chasing her. My head is in scrambles, but I realises he must be trying to trick her, I can stop him then. I. Will. Stop. Him. I grab him by the hair and lift his head up and, SMASH! It plummets back into the pavement I do it again and again and again until I know she won't have to worry about him anymore I do it till HES FUCKING DEAD. “SHES FUCKING MINE YOU HEAR, I WON'T LET YOU HAVE HER YOU SHIT!” I scream but he won't hear me say it, his brains are already split on the ground. I did it I protected her, I need to run though, what if someone saw me they wouldn’t understand I was only protecting someone I need to hide the body ill through him in the well, he was leaving a bar yeah that will work he was drunk and fell, no one will know what I had to do to protect her but yeah I protected her that’s all that matters, ill grab my car and clean up this mess and then ill find her, she might need protecting again. One day when me and her are old she will know what I did for her and the curse will truly hit her too, and then I can be happy as ill have her.

Its been a couple days now, no one’s came to my door about the creep I had to stop and this feeling I have for this girl still isn’t gone, its growing, mutating, poisoning me more and more. I almost can't take it anymore, I need to see her, I want to see her, ill at the bar for her to finish her sift and then we can talk. Hey maybe she'll even thank me for what I did, does she know what I did, yeah, she must just like how I know she needs me as much as I need her. I’ll do it, tonight, ill make her mine. This love I have for her is deep rooted in me now the poison has fully taken control of me and ill use it to make her mine, shell be infected too and ill the beast that gives it to her, a love for me, ill will become cupid that foul demon he is and use his power to make her mine and I will not stop until I have her this love cant even be called an obsession anymore it is an addiction and without it I wouldn’t be able to exist and there she is walking alone I can go talk to her and make her mine…
