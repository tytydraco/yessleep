It was a regular day in my life...until that night....i was in my bed..tired...trying to sleep but i just couldn't......i suddenly heard screaming coming from outside....it sounded like multiple people were screaming...

 I went to the window to check what was goin on and.....nothing....it was normal....then suddenly 2 to 3 people came running down the road screaming....they were running abnormally....like they had been injured or something...it was dark so i couldn't take a good look at why they were running like that...i just brushed it off thinking that they were being chased by sum friend or something and having fun...

So i ignored it and went back to sleep....i suddenly woke up again....3:45am the clock displayed...i woke up hearing a very gentle knock on my door....who the hell wants something at 3 45 in the morning i thought to myself...then i asked loudly.."who the hell are you and what do you want at this time?"......nothing....silence filled the room.....after about 5 minutes of me sitting on my bed and whatever the hell that person or thing was....didnt even move....

Then...i thought to go back to sleep....i was angry and scared at the same time....angry because i was awoken from my good sleep which i wasnt able to get for a while....scared because whatever that thing or whoever that was....didnt even responded or knocked a 2nd time....eventually i fell asleep.......

4:30am....my phone vibrated...it was a call from my friend shawn....I picked up and asked him what happened....he sounded like he just ran a marathon... He told me " have you checked the news on what is happening?" No i said...i was sleeping in my bed...."dude you gotta check the news man....this is exactly like a zombie apocalypse but....its different kind of people"..."what the heck are you even saying are you drunk?" I asked him...."no you idiot just check the news if you think I'm drunk....and in the meantime I'm driving over to your house right now!"

He sounded like he wasnt jokin around which he usually did....so i turned on the tv...to my horror...he wasnt....the whole city was in panic.... apparently there were......lets say creatures if not people running around in the city murdering people with a knife....but...the terrifying thing is...they had no face....no eyes...no mouth...just a knife in their hands and murdering people in the open...

The police reports said....they were immune to gunshots...these creatures were all over the city....the police didnt knew the exact count of how many were there.....i thought to myself "that person who knocked must be one of em"...then suddenly i heard my neighbour scream at the top of her lungs....with the sound of someone being stabbed continuously....thankfully i had a katana knife with me as i was a samurai trainee and pretty good with swords...

I grabbed my sword....went to the door....i looked outside through the peephole....blood all over the walls....on the floor...then all the lights went out.....two shadow figures walked across my door as i saw through the peephole...they were walking abnormally......i was scared...i grabbed a flashlight and got the courage to open the door....i slowly opened the door..thankfully the door didnt make any creaking noise because of good maintenance...

As i opened the door....i saw those two figures walking away far down the hallway....looking at every door...it looked like they were searching for humans....i looked at my neighbours house and saw something that shocked me to my core...i saw my neighbour laying on the ground...dead..stabbed multiple times..her intestines were out of her body..her stomach was cut open...chunks of her flesh on the floor...

I almost screamed but i controlled myself...then i slowly walked to the stairway which was not far for my room.....i almost reached the stairs when i looked at them again and saw the two figures charging towards me with full speed....i started running and trying not to cry and scream for help....i knew screaming for help wasnt gonna do any good because most of the people were killed by those creatures...

As i reached the ground floor..i ran through the sidewalks..while running i saw one of them about 50 feet away from me....i thought i was done....i had no choice but to fight it with my sword....so i stopped....the creature ran towards me like a lunatic....i saw the figure clearly....no eyes....no mouth...it was as if they can sense humans..... they had a human figure.....they had a 7.5 inch knife in their hand...so it charged towards me....i made an attempt to slit its throat....

And i did...but...it didnt make any difference......it still was swinging its knife at me like nothing even happened.....then i made an attempt to cut his hand....i missed a couple of times...but i made it happen....it finally fell to the ground when i did that.....but his hand didnt leave the knife even after being cut off from the body..as if te knife was sticked to its hand..after this i continued running looking for a safe place to hide until my friend came to pick me up....

l found a warehouse just down the block....hid behind a couple of boxes....and took my phone out to call my friend...as i was dialing the number....i could hear many peoples scream being murdered by these creatures alongside with the sound of gunshots....but i knew that gunshots didnt make an affect on them....as i called and told him where i was....i heard footsteps beside my hiding spot....it sounded as if they were looking for me....i stayed silent in my spot praying that they would go away but...no...it was as if they knew where i was hiding and waiting for me to come out...

After about 5 minutes....the sound of the footsteps disappeared...i then got out of my hiding spot....went to the door and tried to look outside....i saw multiple people lying on the floor....blood everywhere on the road...the walls....cars...everything.....as i was looking...i suddenly felt a sharp pain in my back.....it was them....they hadn't left after all....i tried to fight back....and i did...i knew their spot was their hand....so i aimed to cut their hands while fighting these creatures....

I killed one of them...but the pain was so intense i didn't had the power to fight the second one....so i tried to run and i ran in the middle of the street....after running for like...5 seconds...i fell down on the road..and looked at the creature about to stab me to death and knew my life was gonna end right then and there...

But...suddenly a car came at full speed and hit the creature....it was shawn.....he got out of the car with a sword...."aim for the hand with the knife!".....he did exactly as i told him and killed it immediately....he was also a samurai trainee and we trained together..he also knew how to handle swords....he killed it and came to me as i was lying on the road....

"You okay?" He asked....and before i responded.....i saw 6 of the creatures running towards us with full speed from down the road.....i screamed "get in the goddamn car! They're behind you!!" He saw them and immediately carried me and put me in the passenger seat and got in the car and started driving....i passed out in the car because of the wound.
