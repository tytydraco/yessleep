Day 5 of this never-ending eclipse, and it's really starting to get to me. 

Let me bring you guys up to date, its starting early. This morning, I was brushing my teeth, I thought I saw something pass by the bathroom door. I nearly choked on my toothbrush.  Of course, I look in every room of my house, and saw nothing. I walked back to the bathroom and I swear to God, my reflection was there before I looked in the mirror! I recoiled from my mirror, when I looked again, everything seemed normal, but it was enough to send a shiver down my spine.

I’ve been trying to share updates online, keep my friends in the loop. But they’re not buying it. They keep telling me the eclipse is over, like I’m making this all up. They're even blocking me on Facebook now, and for some weird reason, I can't get any photos or videos to upload. Feels like I'm being cut off from everyone.

I grabbed my keys, as i walked into the perpetual twilight, I gazed up at the sun, it seemed less like a celestial oddity, and more like an actual presence. I needing to shake off the unease, so i headed to the gas station. As I drove, I switched on my headlights, but they didn't seem to help, so I tried the high beams, they didn't do much better, and I have HID LED high beams, the kind that will straight up blind people. I even tried the lightbar, that did nothing more than the high beams. It was like, I don't know, driving through a thick fog, but the air was clear. I drove slow the entire way.

The gas station wasn't any better. The price sign flickered like it was on its last legs. It glitched a few times as i pulled in. I was the only one in the parking lot, as I walked in, I saw Mike again, he looked like he was ready to collapse, his face was pale and he had those dark circles under his eyes, he literally looked like an extra on the Walking Dead. "Bro, you really don't look good!" I asked him "Do you want me to take you home, or to the hospital?" Mike looked at me and said "I'm just tired." He rang up my Rockstar and I paid. I looked at him. I tried again to tell him to get some help, take a day off or something, he just shrugged his shoulders and turned back to his phone.

When I stepped outside, thats when things went full on batshit Supernatural, my shadow didn't move right, the bright lights outside didn't cast my shadow away from them, it kind of seemed to pull my shadow towards them, like the light was holding my shadow. I jumped in my truck, my heart pounding. I could see Mike staring at me from inside the store. I don't even think he blinked.

I tried calling Sarah, but she isn't answering her phone, and the police were no help at all, stating that "The eclipse has everyone on edge, but just go home and don't cause problems" I said screw that. I was angry as I left the police station, I got in my truck, and I was shocked as my lights were working correctly again, I blinded myself before I was able to shut off my lightbar and high beams as they shined against the white walls of the police station.

I drove to the lake, hoping to find some solace, and that where I am right now, on my tablet, feeling completely isolated, under the eclipse that supposedly ended 5 days ago. The lake is perfectly calm, the small ripples lapping against the dock, I see no boats, no one fishing. Normally, I'd be at peace, but, I feel very uneasy, like the damned sun is watching me. I don't know what to do.
