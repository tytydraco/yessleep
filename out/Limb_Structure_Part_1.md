**content warning - Homophobic Behavior, drug use, gore, animal brutality**



Death, the first one that hits you in the throes of tumultuous youth, is a real kick to the nethers. I was super close to my grandmother when she passed a little after the start of my sophomore year. It put me in a daze till the beginning of November, just sort of going through the motions. A mournful ghost filling a slot in a factory of the mundane.



Kyle's fist crashed into my arm, jolting me awake. 'You should sleep at home, dude. Principal called you.' I blinked hard, lifting my head off an open history book, vision swimming. My right shoulder throbbed where Kyle had punched me, a sharp, stinging pain spreading through my arm. The classroom buzzed with whispers as every head turned, eyes boring into me like I was the main attraction.



"Dream time is over, Guthy." Even Mr. Stenner sounded relieved to be rid of me. When I lurched to my feet and took a wobbly step on legs tingling with battalions of pinpricks, I had no idea the pants-on-fire, ants-pouring-out-of-eyes, frothing-at-the-mouth, deranged hobo madness I had just taken the first step into.



“Use Dave’s book?” Kyle called out in disdain, the solid school door swinging shut with a persistent will. “It’s got an ocean of drool on it. **Nooooo**.” I couldn’t help but crack a smile. Poor miscreants lounging in the back of the class, barely even present—Kyle was a familiar oddity of comfort. Mr. Stenner became a dull mumble, but Kyle carried an echo of an escort as my legs took me further from a fitful slumber.



“If I turn the page, it’ll spit in my face. I’m not into making out with Guthy. Someone else can read. Get bent!”



Through a cloud of exhaustion, my feet discovered the front office of their own accord. A meeting with the principal, while ~uncommon~, was usually a humble affair: a teacher, a parent, some issue assembling a war of words. A worried ancient guidance counselor exhumed from the 60s, moaning about "the degradation of the moral center, blah blah blah.” 



*This was not that.*



A slew of teachers. A cluster of frightened parents shivering at some hidden acid scorching their hopes and dreams. Police—half the force in residence. Newbie patrollers and veterans alike with grim visages warding off all requests for answers.



I chose this moment to **freak** *the fuck out*. A bundle of nerves in a storm made of weakness-seeking surgical lasers. They needed to find the criminal, and any prey in their way wouldn’t survive a moment of terrified flight. Veering toward the receptionist, eyes darting over every available surface, hand to desk supporting crumbling limbs.



“Guthy.” *Christ, even I’m doing it.* “Kyle, shit… David Kyle Guthier.” I fumbled through my own bloody gushing name.



She haphazardly tapped a button on the desk, and the balding principal erupted out of his office. “Guthy!” A warm welcome, but even Mr. Lothly’s jovial nature was half-suppressed under a quivering voice and digits clutched so firm they’d gone pale ages ago. “Get in. **Quickly.**” No time for pleasantries. Strange, teetering on a chasm of purest despair. He shoved me into a chair, the office crowded with multiple sets of adults that held vague enough similarities to be husbands and wives of a single good Christian line.



“I uh… what?” I struggled with the purpose of this summons of persecution. “Kyle and I… we’re sorry.”



A middle-aged woman, the only one seated, stifled a cry of anguish. The principal moved to console her, holding off an accusation from the husband raging at her shoulder. “Guthy, forget the regular stuff. Not an issue.” Mr. Lothly diffused the situation before the powder keg performed its one life’s duty. “Just listen and speak from the heart. Mr. and Mrs. Taylor want to ask you something. Pete Taylor’s parents, just listen and answer honestly, Guthy. You’re not in trouble.” 



A loaded final sentence. We know what happened, but we don’t know **who** did *what*.



Confined under the dull glare of fluorescent lights, my fingers drummed a nervous tattoo against the wooden armrest. The sharp scent of industrial cleaning products mixed with the mustiness of old books, creating a nauseating blend. Pete’s parents sat nearby, their eyes locked on me, along with a dozen other adults whose worried faces seemed to close in, crowding the modest office. Trepidation lurked behind me, its cold breath prickling the back of my neck.



Mrs. Taylor clutched a worn, ragged notebook with the name 'Pete' scratched into the cover in frantic, overlapping strokes. The book *so damaged* that it barely held together. Her eyes, red-rimmed and desperate, fixed on me.



“Why are you asking me? I barely talk to the guy,” I blurted out, my voice echoing unnaturally in the tense silence.



A moment of intense dismissal and confusion crossed Mrs. Taylor's face. Of all the likely answers to her question, that response had to be **~impossible~**. Her grip on the notebook tightened, knuckles white.



“He mentioned you hundreds of times. He talked about you at dinner *every* night. The stories were so vivid, **so real**. I almost feel like you're a member of the family. Like I've known you for years and practically *raised you myself*. **Please** don’t lie to me about this. I know you’re just as worried as I am. I understand… Peter… he’s unwell. It’s okay to tell me about what he’s going through. You’re not betraying your best friend. Please.”



I sat there dumbfounded. Lost in a riotous North Sea of towering confusion waves. I knew Pete. It’s not a massive or even large school, but he’s *the weirdo*. I didn’t hate him, but we had maybe ten conversations, and Pete would always bring up unrelated topics mid-sentence. He was difficult to talk to, at length. *Raised by her? What the hell?*



I stole a glare at the tattered notebook. Pete’s precious. Always rescuing it from pompous bullies ready to flush-wash their favorite gangly victim. A sea of agitated faces leaned in, desperate for my trifling response.



“Pete was.. agitated last we spoke. A week ago, I think….” I waited for Mr. Lothly, or anyone else to begin the interrogation, no vicious words sought delicate secrets. Silent somber tears and ready ears. “He kept mentioning… Primus?”



Mr Taylor shouted hard enough to shake the room. **“What do you know about that?”** The principal calmed him down and then nodded at me, gesturing for me to answer Mr. Taylor.



“It’s a band. They uhhh.” I struggled for any exit from this firing squad. “They just released an album. Antipop. It's pretty good. I can ask to borrow it from… Kyle.” Sharp, aged eyes narrowed, their warning clear as my words hung in the air.



Mr. Lothly, ever the patient negotiator, stepped between me and the war tribe. “We searched his room.” Mr. Lothly paused polishing sweat across wispy strands of hair clinging to his scalp. “Did Pete let you borrow any of his albums? Did he talk to you about **Primus**?”



“Uh yeah.” Honestly, Pete always talked about Primus. But now, it didn't seem like anyone here was thinking about the band. “The chaos spirals?” I wasn’t sure. Pete was always bent into that notebook scribbling endless daydream scrawls. Class, girls, friends, and having fun meant **nothing** to him. Primus and that ratty doddle book were his world. Mr. Lothly nodded. “Pete, Pete never let me borrow his albums but…” A little white rabbit of a lie to save your flayed skin. “...He uh… This is all a bit weird.”



“It’s ok Guthy. You’re doing great.” Mr. Lothly sat on the edge of his desk his coaching voice coming through, right up to the softball plate.



“Pete came to me. Like last week or... He seemed excited. But it was hard to figure out what he was talking about. He was spewing three discussions in the same sentence.” Mrs. Taylor nodded with a smirk of recognition, which only heightened my rattled unease. “He was manic. *Overwrought*. Kept saying ‘**service the function.**’ I think he was inviting me…”



The room erupted into wordless shouts pointed right at me. It took Mr. Lothly ages to calm the tide. “Enough!” He resorted to booming to slay the fervor. “Guthy is a child, under **my care**. You will not accuse him of any *wrongdoing* or even harass him to gain answers. No matter how troubled any of you might be. If you care about Pete, I ask you to pass that love onto Guthy, too.” 



*What a champion.*



“Now... Guthy, do you remember anything else about last week?” Mr. Lothly addressed me, positioning himself as a barrier between the crowd and me.



“Is Pete… OK?” I knew that he wasn’t. It felt like the right thing to ask.



“He’s Just fine Guthy. We’re looking for clarity here. Gotta cross all those T’s”



That was a bald-faced lie. All the adults winced, and Pete’s mom shed more than a tear. Words caught in my throat, I recoiled, sinking deeper into my chair to distance myself from the seething crowd.



“Ok, he’s done.” Mr. Lothly wasn’t having it. He weathered a cacophony of complaints to no avail. “No. Just no!” Lothly offered me a pad of piping hot photocopied sheets. “You can’t have the notebook, but look through these copies, take some time in the library. Forget about class.” The Principal wrapped my fingers around the paperclipped bundle. Making sure that the package was fully in my possession. “Look through them. Maybe something will jog your memory. Take your time. We’re adults, we got this. But we would appreciate a little help. We're a Bastion of service, and I serve you most. Ok, buddy?”



He patted me on the shoulder and hauled me out of the room beyond my accusers. I heard Mrs. Taylor comment a moment before the door cut off all further chatter. “Why did you keep calling him Guthy?”



*Everyone calls me Guthy, Lady.*



Sitting in the back of the dim library, I flipped through the sheets without looking at them. “What did you do, Pete? How did you get a swarm of cops and parents to buzz around the front office?” Pete's grimy old notebook was supposed to hold the answers. Answers about a lunatic who summoned up an entire friendship out of a few mumbled conversations.



“It’s clearly not about the band. Primus.” The lights flickered. Not in a spooky way. Fluorescent bulbs from decades ago tend to do that. Lights that slowly gasp for sustenance and wither away to heat death. I felt a buzz in my pocket. Motorola brandished. 



“Guthy’s phone? Oh hey, Kara. What’s up? I’m in the library. No, I mean you could sneak in. Well, no, I’m alone in here. I don’t know *why* Ms. McAndry left. Look, I’m not in charge of what the librarian does all day. It’s just me. How long? Lothly made it sound like I could skip today.” I felt a swell of hope and other more fervent hormones. “Your grades. Yeah, take the math test. I know you do the newspaper thing. No, I’m not upset. Well, I might sound upset… Yeah, that tracks. It’s not you though.” Long, heavy sigh of loneliness.



“It’s pretty messed up. No, I’ll be fine.” Sigh of resignation. “Yes, you can definitely count on an exclusive interview. Lead ins? What’s a ***lead-in***? Oh the scoop Uhh, Pete Taylor, yeah loner weirdo, yeah, no not that I know of, but like probably worse. Uh buhh, I dunno. *How could I not know?* Nobody told me anything, really.” Flip phone to cheek-to-shoulder sandwich while fetching the Diner schedule from my pocket. “I’m not scheduled till Thursday. Yeah, after school is fine. The twins would love to see ya again. Yeah, they can be a bit much.” The fifth-period bell rang out.



“No, no. It’s fine *after school*. He’s been asking about me? *Why would I want to keep it a secret?* Yeah, just tell Kyle where I am. He’s mad at me?” Dismissive braying. “He’ll live. I didn’t call myself to the front office. *I narced on him*? **No.** Why now? After years of mischief and misfortune? Well, tell him I don’t care if he deals to afford DJ tables or whatever. ***You didn’t know that?***” Tense vent of lung oil. “I would rather you not spread it around.” Squinting of annoyed eyes. “Yeah, front page of the school newspaper counts. I can’t wait to see you either.”



“It doesn’t mean as much? How?” Second bell for Fifth period. “Yup, no, I lo…” Motorola pocketed. Smeared in angst, among the mildew abyss of the library, my eyes drank in the details of Pete's written ramblings. It was better than 3rd-period calculus. “This ain't the band. This is something…”



The chaotic set of spirals drew me in, each line intertwining and overlapping with another, creating a dizzying, nightmarish pattern. Some spirals twisted into distorted ouroboros shapes, serpents with multiple heads consuming their tails in a never-ending cycle, while others morphed into spirals of eyes-eating arms or cartoonishly grotesque stomachs lined with shark teeth devouring laughing faces.



Each image seemed to feed into the next, with no clear origin point. Interspersed among the spirals were dozens of repetitions of the word "Primus," written in Pete's frantic, uneven scribbles. Pete must have been driven by some unseen compulsion to endlessly transcribe this distorted vision.



My gaze wandered over the repeating, layered doodles, and an intense and unbidden disgust welled up inside me. It wasn't just the grotesque imagery or the unsettling content—**it was something deeper**, something profoundly wrong. Some message snarling a warning between the lines and around the oft-repeated phrase ‘Service the function.’ Most often, though, obscured by rents of pen strokes gouged into each page: “Primus.”



A sudden inexplicable rotation of my vision cone. Standing shelves of books, pages yellowed and forgotten, hanging above the floor. A growl from a desperate, terrified animal echoed as it stumbled ever closer. Tilting its head up, mangy fur, rotten wafting stench, revealed fangs. A mutt pushed to the brink, stalking forward at the first glimpse of a living meat sack. Junk food delivery, ripe for the gorging, sitting there limply…



I fell onto my hands and knees. Elbows itching, knees scratching, red raw skin aching as the world carousel-ed right-side up. Papers drifted to the floor, flung only a moment ago. The entire stack drifting in lazy arcs bent to avoid the thoroughly stained carpet. “What?” I pushed myself to my feet, turning to find my chair clear across the open expanse of the library. “What?” I repeated, gathering my frayed wits and the scattered sheets of danger paper.



Motorola. “I know you’re in class. Skip. **Skip right now**. Uhh uhh make something up. Tell her Lothly OKed it. Yeah emotional support blanket.” Disgusted sound. I shouted through the line while Kyle held up the phone. “I’m really messed up about Pete Taylor and I need Kyle to calm me down!” *Better be thankful about that. Dick.*



A few minutes later, Kyle and I were chilling out at the built-but-never-used overpass to nowhere. Lots of kids hang out here, meant to connect our boring town to **wherever**, but funds, embezzling, adult stuff—that sort of thing. These days, it had a permanent aroma of empty beer cans, weed, and broken promises. The decor was about what you might expect, plus more graffiti. Kyle hurled a glass bottle at the giant letters spelling out ‘Final Door,’ smashing it in a brilliant brown spray of pointless destruction.



“He confiscated my stash.” Kyle moaned.



“Lothly coulda turned you in. You got that going for ya.” I attempted to soothe Kyle’s wounds. “Didn’t he say you could host an event at the school?” I tried to turn it around.



Kyle hurled another bottle, this time aiming into a shadowed alcove. He winced with failure. He missed the visible bright blue and white outline letters ‘ION.’ “I know I’ve been desperate for gigs, and Lothly is cutting me some slack. He’s chill. **I get it**. But my dad found my cash and took it. Claimed ‘rent.’ Absolute dong polisher.” Kyle picked up another bottle, taking a bit to flip and catch it before whipping it at some distant slab of stained concrete.



“You could be in jail right now, or Juvee again or whatever. He pretty much had to take it. You know he was in a band, right? Just ask him for some help.” Offering Kyle a weak solution while avoiding dwelling on the library.



“My dad?” Kyle looked at me like I’d gone mental. “Why *the fuck* would I want to breathe the same toxic air as him?” Kyle hurled a bottle over my head.



I didn’t flinch. “Not your dad. **You ass**. Lothly. He was in a punk band in the Eighties.”



Kyle put up his hands. “Well if you don’t specify. And Like Lothly, what is he sixty? Punk band? 30… No 40 years old and getting on stage. No thanks, I’ll figure it out.”



“Come on.” I ignored a second bottle but threw a can filled with yesterday’s rain back at Kyle. It hit him square in the thigh, splashing across his leg and up his shirt. Most people would be **livid**. Kyle just laughed at me like he’d won an argument. Then he grabbed another bottle and lobbed it at spray-paint-laden concrete. “When you’re a DJ, and if you can play a gig at 40, will you turn it down because you’re too old?” I asked him.



Kyle let his bottle drop to the grass, staring off into the distance. “Hadn’t really thought about it.” We shared some silence. “What about Pete?” Kyle changed the subject, trying to take the focus off of his plans and dreams, painfully beyond his reach.



I let out a sound, after a long while, that can be described as agony.



“That bad huh? Everybody gunna find out you two were running off to squeeze each other’s cream?” Kyle smiled from ear to ear, *malicious prick*, making a lewd gesture just below his belt.



I missed my second can. Kyle smiled harder. “Dude. It’s like super messed. Yeah, he’s a wacko, but he told his mom that he and I were besties and made up a bunch of stories. And I’m sitting there in Lothly’s office, crowded with people convinced I know what happened to their special bus reject kid, and I’ve said like three things to him in the past month.” Shaking with useless fury, I vented to Kyle.



Kyle sauntered over and pulled up an old lawn chair. Sitting in its drenched occupation without a single worry. “That’s a lot more than anyone else in the school.” Kyle reached to pat my knee. “You totally *were* super best friends. Come on, tell me. He’s a good kisser ***right?***”



“Fuck you.”



“Fuck you too.” Kyle threw that back in my face, laughing to himself. “You think if he finds out that we boned, Pete will get all jealous and ask me to cream collage with him?” Kyle joked mercilessly.



I swiped at him but Kyle tilted the chair and fell over. He got up laughing. Nothing seemed to get to him. Unless it was DJ-related or his dad. “Why’s it always gotta be me?”



Kyle shrugged. “You’re a pretty good target. Gayer than the entire Navy. All *them* ~repressed~ men just gotta put a smile on your Oh face!” I chased after him. We scuffled, traded a few blows, and threw some more bottles at the far wall together. We didn’t talk much, aside from an occasional verbal jab by Kyle here and there. “So you gonna tell me… or what?” Kyle asked, lighting up a joint and leaning against a column that supported nothing.



“The rest?” Kyle could always tell when I was holding back. I waved off the joint. “It’s weird.”



“How weird? Waking up with your bed in a field or orgy with grandparents weird?”



“**Dude!**”



“What?” Kyle didn’t look like he knew why I was grossed out by that.



“Gandma.” I answered him.



“Gandpa too?” Kyle insisted as if that was some viable scientific measurement or something.



“Yes! No! Both! I don’t flipping know! *Christ on the cross Kyle.* How long have we been friends?” I was a bit too harsh with him. Had a lot on my mind.



“Since that day at the park when we were six and we found out our names are swapped. Kyle David, this goof is David Kyle. You’re best friends for life, now. Sound about **right** *to you?*” While not angry yet, Kyle was a bit annoyed with me. He let that show in an abrupt, spiky tone.



“Yeah.” I deflated crouching in the weeds. “Code words.”



“Dude, code words are way **above** orgy at Grandma’s.” Kyle finished his joint. Crushing the ember between thumb and finger he flicked it into the ether. “Last time we used it was when *your dad* beat the tar and piss outta *my dad,* clear across the county.”



“Good times.” I announced. Kyle went straight back to smiles as he fetched another bottle to chuck. “Shout touch.”



“Scream seduction.” Kyle retorted without glancing my way.



“How are you always better at this part?” Kyle shrugged even as I offered up another code. “Word Gamble.” I whiffed a bottle way over the wall.



“Don’t waste 'em, man,” Kyle complained humming to himself. “Whisper wager.”



“Wing building.” I countered managing to hit the wall, just on the corner.



“Limb Structure.” Kyle nailed the same spot he’d been targeting for a dozen bottles.



“Ok, so this will sound crazy.”I continued as Kyle bent for more ammunition. “Like Pete was into something. His notebook?” Stumbling over barely formed thoughts, I rambled, leaning into the absurd notions. “Messed up stuff in there, but it looked normal, first you had to like say the right thing. *Or think it.* I dunno.” Recalling, as I spoke the faint haze of events in the library.



“LSD?” Kyle suggested while flipping through a pretend book in his hands.



I shook my head vigorously. “Lothly handed me photocopies.”



“Lothly deals LSD and doesn’t want me sidestepping into his territory. *Makes a lot of sense.*” Kyle sent me a ‘eureka moment’ before a particularly mint throw on target.



“Come on.” I rolled my eyes across the world. “His parents thought Pete was into Primus.”



“Pretty good stuff. I like Brown album.”



“Only it wasn’t Primus. Like. Like. Like.” I began pacing without paying attention. “Primus the band, got‘**Primus’** from somewhere.”



“Latin for ‘The First’ or something.” Kyle answered.



 *How in the blazing Hells did Kyle know that?*



“Yeah, like if you look at the drawings and you think Primus band. You’re safe *or something.* But if you think ‘Not the band’ If you think like different **Primus**, Shit happens. If you keep looking at what you’re not supposed to.”



“What are you even getting at, Guthy!” Kyle erupted in hatred. As it faded, regret lingered in his eyes, a wound etched across his face.



I should have calmed down. But I just couldn’t anymore. I kept screaming at him. “Like I turned into a useless lump and the world went upside down! Then some mangy dog crept into the room. I could smell it, **Kyle!** I could taste ***its hunger***. It was coming right at me! I don’t know **what the fuck this is!**” 



**Void**.



I woke up with Kyle crouched over me. 



“You hit me?” I asked feeling bruised and battered. Mostly in the face so nothing could make that too much worse than it had been before.



“Not at first.” Kyle snorted. “I’m not the one that was clawing at the ground and… I don’t even know **what** that was.”



We traded glares.



Kyle spoke up first. “One minute you were talking about a dog. The next…” Kyle stared off into the distance. “I had no idea you were a skinwalker.” His voice was awash with awe. “Dude this is like Tribal folklore shit.”



“A dog?”



Kyle perked up. Nodding his head for all he was worth. “Dude.”



“Dude,” I replied, in a similar state of what-is-life.



I gazed beyond Kyle, shifting into a seated position. Kyle jumped backward, warding against me and reaching for a bottle he never grabbed. *No one spoke.* Kyle was still Kyle, but what the burning abyss was I? Yeah, it was trippy and Kyle was dealing with it as best he could, but... Look at his clothes. His hoodie is all torn up. The sleeves are confetti. He won't say it. I don't even want to think it.



When I sliced into the first layer of this piss onion... **I'm dangerous**. I don't even remember being ***the dog***. Attacking my friend, what caused it, *how to stop it*. What if it happens around Kara next time? Will she hold me off while I rip out her throat? What about the twins? They're just kids. Ten-year-olds. Maybe. *Maybe not.* Even if they did, what damage would wild, thoughtless fangs do to their fragile forms before they fought me off?



What if they see me? What if somebody who isn't Kyle finds out? What then?



My heart pounded harder, each beat reverberating through my chest like a ticking clock counting down. Pete had been the way he was since freshman year. Former friends told tales of a normal, laughing kid who liked sci-fi books. Is that all I have left? **A year?** *Less?* 



A cold sweat broke out across my forehead, and my breaths became shallow and rapid, as if the air was being sucked out of the sky. My hands trembled uncontrollably, the weight of the terrifying possibilities pressing down on me, suffocating me. I clutched my head, trying to fend off the rising tide of panic, but it was no use; the internal collapse, I was **drowning** in it.



“Guthy! Snap out of it!” Kyle’s hoarse voice braying toward me. At first, I thought it was only a second or two, but the sun now dipping toward the horizon revealed I had been trapped in that panic for hours. “Jesus, *dude*. Do you have any idea how many times I thought about running for help? What the hell is wrong *with you?*” His words came out in a furious spit, his body trembling uncontrollably, his eyes wide with fear. From Kyle’s darting, distraught expression, it was very likely that he was cutting out large portions of the actual events. “**I have to go**. I have to cover for Emily at work so she can watch her sister. You gotta snap out of this like right **now.**”



“**~Emily~**, is she okay?” Flush with immediate concern, my legs pushed me to stand before I could even process it, ready to follow Kyle as he began to turn away.



“You know you already *have* **a** ~girlfriend~, ***right?*** Can’t be dating Kara and **lusting** after my cousin. Could you be a little less obvious?” Kyle was blathering, tossing accusations like his dad when he was drunk, which was always. But for Kyle, it was a sign of incredible tension and frayed nerves. “Your home is **that way!** I go this other way!”



He stamped off, done with me for the day. I hesitated, unable to find an argument that would bring him back to my side. When Kyle got like this, just as when we fought over toys as kids, he needed space and time to calm down. I debated calling Emily to check up on his story but let the matter slide.



My head throbbed, and a wash of dizziness drained any thoughts of chasing after Kyle. I just had to *get home*. The same sort of feeling that overcomes you when you come down with a serious case of the flu. Breathing was difficult, and even walking took considerable effort. It was all I could do to aim for the next tree and stop to catch ragged breaths every ten steps.



It got worse from there. **A lot worse**. When the first animal appeared out of the thicket, I jumped backward, tumbling over tangled feet and roots, shouting in dismay. A wolf, a dark-furred half-breed, marched out of the underbrush, sitting down to stare at me. Not a care in the world. “Nice boy.” I shoved the phrase out of my mouth, hoping it held some minute magic. It shouldn’t be here. This is Indiana; there are *no wolves here*. Not in the Hoosier, not for a hundred years.



I carefully backed away, even as the muscles in my legs began to cramp and seethe with burning ache. I slammed into something that growled and yawned. Reaching back as my pulse quickened and my mind rambled, I felt short fur dancing through my shaking fingers. I dodged and cried, huddling up for an imminent attack as I fled. The mountain lion fixed its unblinking gaze on my trembling feet.



Both predators were in clear view of one another. Neither one gave a toss. Not about each other nor me, other than to ***eye-fuck*** my path. A squirrel darted down the trunk of a tree, clambering up the statuesque cat. The small critter perched atop the cat's skull, peering over its ear and nodding as it traced the path of one of my sneakers. My heart began to seek escape from my ribs. The effing Disney princess fantasy was unfolding before my eyes, proving just how blood-curdling it was in real 3D. “**Animals are not supposed to act like this!**” The argument propelled me hurriedly toward my distant house. My entire body shook as I felt the pressure of the air drastically increase. Clawing at the dirt, flipping around on my hands and knees as more and more forest creatures appeared from nowhere to sit and stare into my increasing terror. Then I hit a wall.



A wall of **sunlight**. A foot thick, pure, and vibrant. Glimmering like the sun off the surface of a lake. Beautiful. Warm. Solid as it should never be. Not to mention the thick light scattering shroud of leaves above. Practically vibrating with tension, my legs raced across the forest floor. Predators and prey held a silent vigil, watching my erratic, panic-laced movements. “**It’s in the way!** My house. *My home*. The other ~side!~” To no avail, I raged at the brilliant barrier that stretched across the woodland.



Stifling a sob and a cry of pathetic wounded misery, I hammered at the solid wrongness cast upon the world. It stole my fist. Tugging at my trapped hand, I screamed in agony. My useless animal desperation only pulled me further into the glowing cliff of unrelenting power. My insane howls dulled by the rectangular bubble of crushing weight. Until it spat me out. Discarded as broken tendrils of light wall gently caressed my cheek.



I flailed like a man being swarmed by vicious invisible bees. Errant thoughts and tiny shards of nightmare swarming to dig into my skull. **I have to get out!** I have to be safe. I have to *make it home.* I fled. More than cowardice. I could feel the gripping claws of a gargantuan beast smash into my back with every panic-fueled step. Enough ground to escape was never covered. All the while, my lungs scorched and my muscles ripped themselves apart. Wordless moans of frenzied strife churned across my lips.



And it just kept getting worse.

Abrupt lunge into a babbling brook. Raw gashes on my palms and face, ripped skin hanging and dripping blood from self-inflicted idiocy. It took all that I had not to give up *then* and **there**. Hauling my aching, drenched form from the water, shock coated my face as vomitous green sludge rocketed through the stream. Upon arriving at my feet, it recoiled. This putrid mass of liquid goopy filth. Swallowing my revulsion the living bile squelched through the undergrowth.

I had to pause. *What deranged twin of life had I wandered into?* A delirious reality flinched away from the curse infecting my flesh. I could only stumble forward. Barely enough fortitude to keep my feet beneath me. Every meter was a battle to convince my body to obey its master, and I was starting to doubt that I still measured up.

I kept moving, getting closer and closer to the edge of the backyard. *It wasn’t that far off*. But with the setting sun and the darkening sky, the twisted forest only grew all the stranger. Looming sharp shadows cut jagged swaths across the woods. In saner pastures, shadows should be dark, but here they blazed with intense glare and heat.

There wasn’t anywhere to look. No safe spot. No **refuge** from this Planescape of abyssal existence. My slashing fingers tore into the soil, through bushes and roots to haul ever forward. Tickling sweetly into my nostrils came the delicate embrace of a candied aroma. *A light of hope*. I heaved through the rigid collapse of every muscle fiber in my body, lungs barely even functioning, ragged coughs erupting with every inch gained. *So close*. I could taste the warm radiant comfort. Just beyond this hillock. Just a few more furious pulls of dead weight and I’d be happy with my family, eating a gorgeous meal.

I should have known better. I should have learned. But in my desperation, fighting against a burst oil well of despair. *I had been a fool.*

In a small clearing, thick with unnatural sunshine and happy birdsong from the treetops, a rotten festering carcass lay with its guts strewn across the dirt. Between me and a distant glimpse of the house up on a hill, I sobbed. Salty streaks of subjugation poured down my cheeks. Not for the horrifically wounded, still alive, and whimpering neighbor dog. Not for the all-too-far outline of the house. For the smell and the taste in the air. I was ravenous as if I had never eaten before. All my energy reserves dwindled to dust. All my mustered courage snapped in twain, while my thoughtless animal thrashes tightened the noose of this trap.

Tapping my paws freely, stepping into the carnage with a predator's delight and a boy cowering in the passenger seat, greedy glowing eyes peered into the banquet. The blood-drenched ground heaved with the unseen breaths of some godless monster. *I just wanted it to be over.* I just wanted **to give in** and let it take me completely—more than I’ve ever desired anything else. But as I prodded the quivering chunks of gore with my pointed nose, I couldn’t help but relish the sight of the visceral display.

The broken being continued to cry under its torment. Delivering an endless supply of soul-slicing blades unto my furry dog ears. Within its viscera, among the scattered pumping organs and veins, was a miniature model. My **home**, my *town*. Buildings made of cracked bone and blood-splattering organs fitful in their operation. Nerve endings and lumps of innards walking neat little paths along blood vessel streets. My *friends*, my **family**, all represented.

I have no idea where I summoned it from. I can’t tell you to this day. Strength like that comes once in a generation. Knowing I would certainly incur the wrath of some primordial entity of malice. Despite the mountains of horror shattering my spirit, I lunged at the dog's neck, ripping apart its throat. Biting and tearing, shattering skull and bone until paste was all that remained. Though terrified and alien in my current form, I gained some small measure of victory. Some scant remorse and triumph.

I sat there in that clearing as the night, the true darkness, wrapped itself around my human shoulders once more. Crying tears of glass, groaning as I hoped the infinite hideous terror would leave my form.

**It did not**.
