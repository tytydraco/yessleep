“Do you feel them trying to fit inside you?”

It was 3 AM and I was in the emergency room of a hospital in Los Angeles when a homeless man asked me this question. I heard him, even over the TV in the reception room that was full volume blaring an infomercial about an award-winning mattress topper called "Mara". 

I was there because my girlfriend had a sharp pain in her side (don't worry she was fine, passed a gallstone or something), and in my worried state I had been concentrating on the infomercial to take my mind off of things. 

Suffice to say, the question took me by surprise. 

I don’t know if you’ve been to an ER, ever, but in Los Angeles at 3 AM it’s pretty much half homeless people and half other patients and such was the clientelle of the room. I had been up late the night before for unrelated reasons, and at the time I was pretty fucking wasted.

I will say I hate prefacing this story with what my mental state was at the time, because whenever I tell people about what happened that's the only thing they hang on to. That I was too tired, or that I was hallucinating.  

Tired. Sleepy. Out of it. That's all my family and friends had to say. It’s comforting though, the idea that it was just my brain playing tricks on me. I even tell myself that's what happened sometimes. I do so, because every time I think about that day and realize, with perfect clarity, that I experienced something extra dimensional, it threatens to shatter my psyche. 

Anyway. 3 AM. TV blaring. I was staring at a homeless man, stunned. 

The TV filled the silence:

"Get some sleep on our patented octagonal spring technology! That's right! Every Mara mattress topper contains-.

Jack, the homeless man who had asked me the question, was a regular in this Emergency Room. How do I know? When the nurse came out and announced “Jack?” to intake the next patient, they sighed heavily upon seeing him. Jack, unlike my girlfriend, returned quickly after they processed him. No doubt, they had become efficient at helping him after so much practice. Anyway, that was why we were there, together. 

All I said was "Oh... uh... no! Sorry!"

I attempted to salvage the situation by clacking open my Airpods. I was so close. So close to noise cancelling bliss before I heard him again.

“It could be nothing, but it could be a kidney stone or gallstone. Or worse. I’m not losing you to something stupid and treatable. We're going to the ER.”

I didn't speak, but if my face had an expression it was *What the fuck?*

That was, exactly, what I had said to my girlfriend before we left. Word for word. His tone was even was similar to how I spoke. 

The TV interrupted:

“The new Mara bed springs! Pentagonal! 50x better than all other mattresses! Awarded nearly 100 patents!”

Maybe it was my expression, but after a couple seconds, Jack slowly turned back to face forward. Watching him for several minutes, I realized he was now perfectly still. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. Fine by me. It sounds stupid, but I immediately convinced myself his outburst was a total coincidence. Or that I had maybe made a connection where there wasn't one, or misremembered something. 

*Yeah, that was the Mandela effect, or something,* I thought, convincing myself.

If you think that was dumb or brushing off something insane, have at me. Whatever. The reality was I had to wait for my girlfriend. Imagine if I let her come back, alone, to an empty reception room with just Jack, because *I* was scared. Not happening.

So I listened to the infomercial, and began tuning out:

"Enter a deep sleep with our product! Truly an UNPRECEDENTED piece of technology!"

It was a couple hours later that I realized Jack, who had been previously erratic, had not moved at all. Is he OK? Nervously, I looked over to the reception desk to see if the security guard was paying attention to him. No one was there.  

*When the fuck did the security guard leave? Are they even supposed to do that?* 

Come to think of it, the whole waiting room was strange. Why is it only us two in here? Wasn't there a bunch of people? Did they leave when I wasn't paying attention?  

The TV continued:

“Literally millions love Mara! You’ll want to sleep forever! “

And this fucking infomercial, too! It was also weird. 

Initially, I had found it entrancing. Having not had cable in a while, it reminded me of times I'd stay home sick from school and watch daytime TV. Memories as a child of that neon blue screen with the bright yellow phone number, repeated the market-researched approved three times total to make sure the consumer remembered it. 

The TV flooded me with memories. It made me feel like a kid again. 

*But*, my brain seemed to say, *isn't it weird that this commercial is still going? We've been here for hours.* 

The TV blared:  
“Truly UNPRECEDENTED sleep with ratings you won't believe! Millions love us and you’re next! Call now it’s your last chance!”

Maybe it was the delirium from being up so late but I found the latest quip hilarious as it interrupted my thoughts. The accomplishments stacked so high, and the buzzwords to market a mattress topper were so outlandish. I suppressed a laugh as a cough in an attempt to not get Jack's attention. 

Yet, at nearly the same time, Jack coughed too. He sounded more like he was hacking up a lung than covering up a laugh, though. Still it startled me- it was a departure from the total stillness he had adopted. 

I looked again at the reception desk to see if anyone could help him, and remembered again that the two of us were completely alone, and had been for hours. I remembered, again, the weirdness of my situation. Why had I forgotten so quickly?

**“I literally melted into my mattress when I tried Mara.”**

And why the fuck is the TV so loud now?

**"MELTING! JUST MELTING!"**

The TV was extremely loud now. The words barely made sense. My heart rate was going crazy, and I was sweating bullets.  

Okay, that did it. 36 hours of no sleep, the stressful situation, I'm literally going crazy. I should get up finally and go get some help. Thankfully, I'm in a hospital already. I grabbed my knees and stood-

And as soon as I did I nearly fainted.

Abruptly, at the exact same time I had, Jack had also gotten up.

I jerked my leg backwards in surprise, hitting it on the chair behind me. I nearly fell before stabilizing myself on the wall behind me.

In front of me, Jack, in perfect unison, kicked his chairs backward, and mimicked falling backwards. His arm stuck out backwards, and broke his fall immediately, as if he had caught himself on an invisible surface. Unnaturally, impossibly, he balanced himself like this as I stared in horror.

“What the fuck!” we said in unison.

We screamed for help. We cried.

I ran, he followed. Not missing a step. In perfect sync.

I made a beeline for the exit. In this fight or flight moment, flight is what my brain chose. 

I sprinted, fueled with adrenaline, trying to ignore the fact that Jack's clambering footsteps matched mine perfectly. 

*Where the fuck did this long hallway even come from? I could have sworn the exit was right there!*

I allowed myself a quick glance backwards as I ran, avoiding looking at Jack's face. I nearly broke down

Jack was the exact same distance away as when we started. He might have even gotten closer.

After a few more seconds of running, I stopped suddenly and fully turned around, ready to confront Jack. Except, he had turned around as well. I was looking at the back of his head. 

"GET AWAY FROM ME!", we screamed into the empty hallway. 

I took a step towards him. He moved away, perfectly.  

Fight or Flight. Fight or Flight. Fight or-

*"*How can I fight someone who is me*?"*, Jack and I said. 

*Why would I say that?* My panicked brain questioned, *he's not me he's just imitating me!*

**"MELTING MELTING MELTING MELTING MELTING"** 

The TV's audio was screeching throughout the hallway, destroying my line of thought. Louder and louder, we covered our ears. I saw trickles of blood go down the sides of Jack's ears, and when I felt something drip down my cheek, I realized my eardrums were bleeding too. 

The sensation of my blood dripping down my cheek, strangely, grounded me. I was allowed a moment to think.

In that moment, I thought of my girlfriend. 

My lovely girlfriend. The only one who really listened to me. Who stuck by me through thick and thin. My ride or die who let me bother her with my nerdy habits. Who supported me and I her through every one of life's trials. Who didn't know I had bought a ring, only days before today. 

I broke every traffic law in Los Angeles getting her to the hospital because I knew I couldn't live without her. And now I would never see her again. 

My brain, taking pity on me, thought about yesterday. A better time. I was teaching my girl chess, almost certainly because she wanted to spend time with me and learn about my hobby than from a genuine interest. 

She was so mad, her eyebrow were furrowed and she had thrown her phone away. Still cute. Someone online had beaten her. 

"What the hell! He just copied all the moves I made until I made a mistake!"

*Why am I remembering this? Am I dying?*

I laughed.

"That's actually a super annoying tactic newer players can do."

"How do you beat it?"

"Well, basically, you just do something they *can't* do."

I showed her on the game review screen, a move that could have stopped the other player.

"Like checkmate. They don't get to move after checkmate." I said.

She nodded, "Gotta be fast."

I didn't know if she was really listening, but we liked the sounds of each other's voices. 

*Do something they can't do...*

It was in that second, that I realized I did have one move left. A checkmate.

*Something Jack can't do.*

Cautiously, I summoned my last bit of courage and moved towards Jack. He stepped away, or rather, stepped towards the direction I was going. 

I moved quicker, going from a walk, to a jog, to a run, until we re-entered the reception room.

There in the far corner of the room, the TV was there. It's screen was... nonsense, a rapid flash of different colors that hurt my eyes. Some colors I... couldn't recognize. There was something I couldn't comprehend about it. And of course, it was deafeningly loud.

**"MELTINGMELTINGMELTINGYOU'LL BE OURS SOONMELTINGMELTING"**

Nearly fainting from the pain in my eardrums, Jack and I willed ourselves to each respective corner of the room. In our positions, Jack was right next to the TV, and I, next to open space. 

We pulled up chairs, and stood on them. I looked forward into the empty space before me. I stole a look to my right, to make sure Jack was in position. Directly in front of him was the television.

I took a deep breath. 

Despite everything, I didn't want to do this to Jack. Really, what had he done? He was probably as much of a victim as I was. But someone was expecting me to be there, waiting for her. So, I reeled backwards, and as if headbanging, brought my head crashing forwards with all my strength.

To my right, I heard an enormous crash, then the sound of shattering of glass hitting the floor.

I regret this, but I could not help but glance over to my right, to inspect Jack. The TV was quiet now, it's glass shattered, but still somehow stayed mounted to the wall. Jack was facing away from me, but still, the image made my stomach drop. Shards of glass stuck out of every part of his head, and his neck was... wrong. Something had snapped, and his neck looked like a broken straw. The muscles in his shoulders twitched like crazy as if they were trying to hold him together. 

I didn't want to continue. Physically, my body did not want to. But I had to.  

I repeated the motion, this time over and over. I kept going until I heard the crack of his skull. I kept going through the squelch of brain matter and gore. Until so much blood spilled onto the floor, that it trailed over to my side of the room. I kept going and going and going...

Until I saw the face of my girlfriend

"Richie! Wake up! Oh my God!" 

I was in the emergency room again. No TV, just the searing white lights.

I wasn't alone. A group of people, who I recognized as patients originally in the ER, crowded around the edges of the room. The security guard was there. Was he yelling? Why does everyone look so afraid?

They were all watching Jack, who, standing on the reception desk, held something that glinted off the light. It was a huge knife, so big I'm not sure how he had concealed it until that moment. 

Jack saw that I got up and looked at me. He was fine now. Despite the mood in the room, I actually felt some relief.

"Thank God, buddy! I thought they almost got ya!" Jack said, appreciatively, waving the knife.

The security guard was yelling for Jack to get down, to put the knife down, anything to restore order.

"Almost broke down your barrier. Smart thinking, man. But they're just going to use me to get to you again!"

I don't think anyone was listening to what he was saying. The other patients were screaming, talking to each other. Jack was right next to the only exit.

“They don’t get it this emotional shit man. That’s just chemicals. The only thing they care about is the energy. That’s the only thing we got in common we’re all energy. And they'll keep coming for yours.”

He took a second and looked over his knife. To him, it didn't seem like anyone else in the room existed other than me and him. 

"We're all energy, all the same. But you got someone to take care of. I don't."

The security guard was trying to regain control of the situation - "Jack put it down! Stop talking to hi-"

"I AIN'T GONNA LET THEM GET MY BUDDY," Jack screamed as he sliced his throat open.

I think I tried to say something to Jack. I don't know what. But I think I tried. 

After Jack collapsed, it was pretty much mayhem as everyone ran for the door. I wish I could say I did the same and brought my girlfriend to safety, but it was mostly her pulling me out of there. She later told me it was like I was in a trance or something when we left. 

I don't remember much after that- I don't even know if emergency services showed up or anything. I guess they did since we were already in the hospital. But we just drove home.

Everyone said their condolences, worrying about our mental states after what happened. I wasn't necessarily great, but got by, and honestly my girlfriend is tougher than I am. Sadly she has seen worse than what she witnessed there as a social worker specialising in child counseling. If anything, she was more worried about my constant recollection of the story.

"Babe, you almost definitely were sleeping the whole time. I'm not saying it wasn't traumatic. I'm just saying you need to know it wasn't real."

I'd always assure her I knew that, and she, suspicious, always let it go. I mean, like I said, it was a comforting thought. That I was asleep, tired, etc. 

But it was the other day that I drove to work that I happened to take a route that went by that hospital. Traffic was bad, and google maps recommended the route. I knew it wasn't a good idea, but I decided to stop by. Maybe Jack had a memorial, or something. I'd like to visit.

When I drove by, I saw something on the side of the road- a tent, some garbage, a place to sleep. An abandoned homeless encampment. I remember thinking, maybe this is where Jack was. It's close to the hospital where he was a regular- it makes sense. 

I remember seeing, as the light turned green his mattress looking a little thin. Like it was a topper and not a full mattress. It was small, so I'm not sure, but I think I remember seeing a label. It read, "Mara".
