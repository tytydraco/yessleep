I joined the sleep research center last semester as part of my psychology program. It seemed like a straightforward way to boost my academic standing—another line on my resume, another step toward better opportunities. But now, I wish I had never signed up.

I won’t waste your time. Something is wrong with this study. Something is wrong with me. I feel surrounded—like everyone is against me, like I have nowhere left to turn. People talk about waking up, about enlightenment. But this feels like the opposite. I’ve been sundowned, dimmed, diminished.

\#

I was in my psychology of life course and we were reviewing sleep cycles and REM and all that. Professor Van den Berg taught the course. He had a reputation for making people uncomfortable. Not by anything he did—just by standing there. From the pit of the auditorium, he seemed to tower over us. His posture was loose, and unnatural, like a marionette slumped against its strings. Even the way he moved—jerky, imprecise—felt like a puppet miming human gestures.

“There is an opportunity,” Van den Berg announced, his voice smooth but hollow. “For select students nearing graduation. A chance to assist in an ongoing, complex study. To gain experience in my lab.” He let the silence stretch. “Admittance will be determined by an essay,” he continued. “It must be original—drawn from personal experience and introspection. It must be universal. It must be phenomenological.”

I didn’t know much about sleep. I knew I never got enough of it. I knew about nightmares and phallic symbols, Freud and Jung, REM cycles, lucid dreams, and sleep paralysis. But that wouldn’t be enough. If I wanted to write something truly phenomenological, I had to experience something worth writing about.

So, I made a decision. I ordered a mix of over-the-counter pills, an improvised sleep cocktail. Anything to push me deeper into dreaming.

\#

The first night I took them, Alice stayed over.

“You’re really taking all those?” She eyed the mound of earthy pills in my palm. “You really think it’s worth it? Van den Berg is a weirdo. Never catch me sleeping with him around.”

“I need something real to write about. If anything goes wrong, you’re here to call an ambulance. Or flip me on my side so I don’t choke on my vomit.”

I didn’t actually think I’d die, but it was a good excuse to get her to stay.

Alice rolled her eyes. “So you’re just going to be drifting, drifting, drifting away while I sit here bored? Guess I’ll just drink alone.”

She repeated that word—"drifting." I remember it clearly. Or maybe I don’t. Maybe I’m misremembering. But if I can’t trust my memory, then I have nothing.

I swallowed the pills, choking on their jagged edges, gagging on the taste of licorice and mud. My head hit the pillow.

I fell asleep.

\#

Alice’s voice hit like a siren. “Get the fuck up! Get up!”

Cold tile pressed against my cheek. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, harsh and sterile. My head throbbed.

“Hmm? Where are we?” My tongue felt thick.

“Police are coming! Fucking move!” Alice yanked me upright.

The hum of washing machines mixed with her ragged breath. My vision rippled—warped, fish-bowled. The world swayed like I was underwater.

“Where are we?” I forced out.

“A fucking laundromat—now go!” Alice shoved me through the door.

My legs barely held me. Pins and needles. Two sacks of worms. My chest a hollow tree trunk.

Behind us, a voice buzzed like a nest of wasps. “Where did they go?”

Alice dragged me into an alley.

No one found us.

\#

“I broke in and passed out?” My voice felt distant. I leaned my head against the back of the couch.

Alice nodded and handed me a glass of water. “Drink. And yes. But more exactly—you broke in through the window, then passed out inside. The laundromat wasn't even closed. A handful of people saw you and called the cops. I was a little worried about how the alcohol would mix with everything.”

I frowned. “I don’t remember drinking.”

I didn’t remember getting back to the dorm. I didn’t remember anything. A cold weight settled in my chest. Did she drug me before? Is she drugging me now?

I stared at the empty glass in my hand. “How did we get back here?”

Alice exhaled sharply. “You’re done with the pills. Experiment over. Sleep like a normal person. Drift, drift, drift… the way a normal person does.”

And then, I woke up

\#

“Yeah, I get it.” Alice didn’t look up from her phone. She exhaled through her nose, a soft sigh every few seconds. Was she laughing at something? I should have counted how many times she did that. Timed it. Measured the rate. Maybe that would have revealed something.

Only once more would I tell Alice what I dreamt. After that, I stopped speaking about the dreams. Because when I did, they felt more real. 

\#

I kept going like this. Dreaming, documenting, searching for something worth writing about. My dream journal sprawled across the floor, like a detective’s case file—red-threaded veins running across the pages.

Themes: Alice tells me to stop taking the pills. Stepping on broken glass. I watch myself die. I hear people talk about me. I am someone else. I’m being attacked. No one will help me. I am haunted.

None of it means anything.

I learned this: dreams have structure. Levels of immersion. You can be lucid or half-lucid—aware of the dream, but not fully in control. You can feel everything, or nothing. You can dream in first-person, or third. Sometimes you’re omnipresent, like a god—a cold camera, detached from it all. Perhaps that’s what God is. Perhaps he’s nothing more than an observer, coldly recording.

My essay detailed this structure. Van den Berg gave me the position, and I stopped taking the pills.

\#

My work in the lab started immediately. Van den Berg said the study had been running for some time. This was just another phase. Another iteration of what had already been done. Further validation.

I arrived at night and waited in the empty lobby for Van den Berg. No secretary at the desk. The fluorescent lights flickered, dimmed, and fogged over.

A door swung open, and there he was. I realized then—I never stood close to him. He was ungainly, towering at six foot ten, his lab coat sagging off his wiry frame like a melting candle. He shook my hand—cold and clammy, a dead fish with thin quills jutting from its body.

I pulled back, feigned itching my face. My hand smelled of frankincense.

He handed me a clipboard. “Let’s start the rounds.”

\#

At first glance, the lab looked comfortable. Each room had blackout drapes, tight-fitting sheets, a sink, a mirror, a desk-side lamp, and a pair of eye shades resting on the pillow. Monitoring equipment loomed in the unpeopled corners—screens dead and waiting for a touch to bring them to life. A green light glistened from a dot in the ceiling: “Smile, you’re on camera.”

We entered a participant’s room. Van den Berg gave no notice of his entrance. He simply walked in and stood over the participant, looming.

The man lay motionless on the bed, his eyes wide open, staring.

“The eye shades don’t fit right. Do I have to wear them?” he asked, his voice weak. “This smock is bothering me. Is there—?”

Van den Berg cleared his throat. “Part of the condition requires wearing the eye shades and consistent attire. It’s a potential confound if you don’t.”

The man said nothing. Van den Berg stepped closer, his legs pressing against the side of the bed. He pulled a vial from his lab coat, unscrewed it slowly, and ceremoniously waved it under the man’s nose. Then he sealed it shut.

“Drift, drift, drift. Dream like normal.”

He gestured for me to follow him out. He snapped the lights off and shut the door. I swear I heard the man snoring before it clicked shut.

As we left the room, Van den Berg turned to me. “Write this down: participant 55 requests an attire change—denied.”

I nodded, scribbled it on the clipboard, and followed him to the monitoring station—the Penopticon, he called it.

Van den Berg sat and patted a chair next to him. I took a seat. Even while sitting, he towered over me, his presence overwhelming. I felt that dizzying sensation of looking up at a skyscraper, standing as a speck at its base.

He turned toward the wall of monitors. Sleeping bodies filled the screens, static bled through, distorting their features, like watching an old VHS tape with a soft, haunting fuzz.

Van den Berg was silent as he watched them sleep. Every so often, he touched a finger to the screen, as if miming some internal dialogue, or he’d see a slight movement and exhale a soft “oh.”

Then I heard it—a faint buzzing, like a nest of wasps trapped behind glass. It wasn’t the monitors, not the machines, but something about Van den Berg’s voice. His tone was slow, droning, almost hypnotic, like his words were buzzing around the edges of my mind.

He didn’t acknowledge it, but the buzzing seemed to intensify as he spoke.

“What happens when you observe someone’s dream?” he asked, his voice soft and measured. “Don’t answer. Physicists know this one: the outcome changes.” He raised a spindly finger in a "eureka" gesture.

“You can observe their dreams?” I asked, my curiosity piqued.

Van den Berg smiled, almost gently. “No, that does not exist, I’m afraid. But we can teach them to dream certain things.”

“Like lucid dreaming?” I pressed.

He nodded. “Much the same. Only, the locus of control is external. We determine the dream content, not the participant.”

He leaned forward, voice lowering, the buzzing almost pulsing in the air around us. “Imagine this: you have a fear of public speaking, but you must give an important presentation. You come to us, and we can erase that fear by manufacturing dreams that generate positive feelings—guaranteed successful outcomes, assured confidence. Do you see?”

A small light on the Penopticon wall blinked red.

Van den Berg let out a soft sigh, the buzzing dissipating for a moment. “I think we’ll end observation for now. I don’t want to overwhelm you on your first night. Besides, you’ll need to study for my exam.” He smiled, his teeth impossibly straight, white, and aligned. “Let’s resume again tomorrow evening. Same time.”

With a quick gesture, he ushered me out into the dark of the parking lot. He shouted “Goodnight”, locked the door behind me, and disappeared back into the lab.

Alice came by while I was still wide awake, and she always seemed to be the same—never asleep, always moving.

“Sounds pretty weird, just watching people sleep like that.” She said, her voice flat. “Just watching people drift, drift…”

“Why are you saying that?” My voice was sharper than I meant.

“Holy hell, don’t start yelling for no reason. Maybe you should get to bed. I’m sure you’ve had a long day.”

“No. You said it before. You said it, and the professor said it.” I took a slow breath, then grabbed a glass of water—I didn’t remember pouring it. The room smelled like frankincense, thick and suffocating.

“He probably said it during lecture or something. I don’t know. Maybe I just unconsciously picked it up. He says all sorts of weird shit, doesn’t he?” Alice barely looked up, scrolling through her phone. “Ugh, it’s late. Care if I stay over?”

\#

I woke in the middle of the night—just opened my eyes, didn’t stir. I felt Alice close behind me, her breathing warm against my skin, felt her move even closer. She put her mouth near my ear and whispered, “Dream like normal.” Her breathing became rhythmic, like a metronome. I thought to turn over, but my body wouldn’t budge.

I felt myself rising, floating, my body detaching, my back now pressed against the ceiling. I saw Alice and myself from above, but her whispering still echoed in my ears. Breathing, then whispering. Breathing, then whispering.

Blinking, I found myself somewhere else. I hovered above a grid, five by five. I tried to focus, but the red light illuminating each cell made it hard to see. My “body,” or spirit, moved closer, isolating one of the cells. Inside, a bed. A person tied down, their eyes shaded. The red light barely lit the room, casting everything in an eerie glow. The edges of the room were lost in blackness. The darkness bled into the center, black to red, a soft, womb-like light.

I noticed the monitoring equipment in the dark corners—the faint shimmer of a green recording light. The smock on the sleeping person. I woke up.

\#

It keeps happening. I don’t know what to do next.

I still see the rooms most nights. I stopped taking the pills months ago, but the dreams haven’t stopped. I can’t make out their faces, can’t tell if I visit the same room, or a different one each time.

Alice denies everything—saying anything, doing anything. My constant questioning drove us apart. We’re taking a break, and I haven’t seen her in months. Some people say she got expelled for underage drinking, or that she dropped out on her own, left the school intentionally. Plenty of people don’t even remember her.

Strangely, I found a photo of her at the lab. She stood alongside Van den Berg and some others, their expressions unreadable. On the back, someone had written ‘Cohort 1.’ There were other photos too—different groups, different years—but no one else I recognized.

I still wake in the middle of the night sometimes, hear Alice whispering to me, and then I wake up again, completely alone.

Van den Berg’s class is over, but I still help out in the lab. It’s slow, mostly uneventful. I’ve thought about quitting, but I get a stipend—and, more importantly, a guaranteed spot in the graduate program if I stick with the study.

A few participants have dropped out, their names crossed out in red ink. One day, while searching for a clipboard, I found some old forms—lists of past participants, the same red slashes through their names. Next to a few of them, Van den Berg had written a single word in his cramped handwriting: ‘Prescient.’

There are still many nights he rushes out of the lab to close up early or handle some vague emergency.

One night, as he hurried me out, I asked him what the blinking light meant.

“It would confound the study if I were to tell you. Some knots aren’t meant to be untied,” he said, shutting the door behind me.
