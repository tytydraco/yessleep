I'm back with an update. Nothing major has happened recently, except that I've become a father. No, not in the way you're thinking. I'm not married; this job pretty much makes marriage impossible for me. I'll explain what happened later.



Let's get back to where I left off with the delivery.



The delivery was scheduled for 4:17 PM. Location: Moonlight Zoo. Please ask for the manager.



The instructions on the pamphlet were surprisingly brief:



1. Arrive after sunset but before midnight.



2. The zoo will appear closed. Please enter through the service gate on the west side. The gate will be unlocked.



3. Proceed directly to the reptile house. Do not stop to observe any enclosures, even if you hear animal sounds.



4. The manager will meet you at the entrance to the reptile house. Hand the items directly to him.



5. The manager may try to engage you in conversation. You may respond politely, but do not accept any offers to tour the zoo.



6. Leave immediately after completing the delivery. Do not look back at the reptile house.



7. Courier S.K.'s note: These are definitely real animals.



When I arrived at the zoo at 7:30 PM, the parking lot was empty. The main gate was locked, but the service gate opened with a gentle push, its rusty hinges silent.



The three raw steaks I was delivering, each in a thermal bag, seemed to be subtly moving, as if still breathing. I tried not to think about it.



The small paths in the zoo were lit by old-fashioned gas lamps, casting a bluish-white light. In the enclosures on either side, I saw figures moving—large ones, small ones, and some that moved in ways unlike any animal I'd ever seen. Something that might have been a bear stood on its hind legs, waving many arms at me. Something in the aviary sang in perfect human language: "Come closer, come closer, we have much to discuss."



I kept my eyes straight ahead and quickened my pace.



The reptile house was a Victorian-era greenhouse, all glass and iron framework. A woman in a zoo keeper's uniform stood at the entrance, the uniform looking like something from the 1920s—khaki shirt, breeches, and tall boots. She was tall and slender, her black hair meticulously pulled back into a bun, and her yellow eyes had vertical pupils.



“You must be the delivery person,” she said. Her voice was hoarse, like a deflating tire. “Excellent. We’ve been waiting for dinner.”



I handed her the bag. “Three steaks, as ordered.”



“Good.” She glanced at the bag, then extended a long, forked tongue and licked the air. “Still warm. Still moving. Perfect.” She looked at me with those reptilian eyes. “Do you want to see what we feed them? Quite a variety.”



“No, I have other deliveries to make.”



“What a shame.” She stepped aside, and through the glass wall of the reptile house, I saw things in the cages that were definitely not reptiles. Or, if they were reptiles, they were from somewhere else, a place with different anatomical and physical rules.



“I should go.”



“Of course.” She took a steak from the bag and held it up. The steak twitched in her hand, and I realized with a jolt of fear that it was growing new tissue, regenerating.



Thankfully, she just grinned, revealing a mouth full of sharp, pointed teeth. “Have a safe trip, delivery man.”



I hurried away, the sounds of feeding following me—wet, tearing sounds, and satisfied groans, perhaps from the zookeeper, or the animals she was feeding, or the meat itself.



As I reached my car, my phone buzzed. “$198.25 deposited into your account.”



After the zoo incident, I chose a normal order. A family dinner order—pizza, breadsticks, and salad—to 4782 Oakwood Avenue. It was a nice neighborhood, well-maintained houses, minivans in the driveways.



The order form was blank. No rules, just the address.



This should have alerted me.



At 6:45 PM, I parked in front of the house. Every window was brightly lit. Through the sheer curtains, I saw a family sitting around a dinner table, parents and two children. A perfect picture of suburban life.



I held the pizza bag in my hand and rang the doorbell.



The father opened the door, beaming. "Oh, wonderful! The children are starving. How much is it?"



"It's already paid for, sir. I just need your signature."



He signed on my phone, John Smith, which should have been another warning sign, and then took the pizza bag. "Would you like to come in? We're about to say grace."



"I really should be going."



"I insist. It's the least we can do. After all, you brought us dinner."



Something in his tone made it sound less like an invitation and more like a plea. I went inside.



The house had a strange smell. Not unpleasant, but artificial, like someone had sprayed air freshener on something rotting. The family sitting around the table looked picture-perfect—too perfect. Their smiles were just right, their postures impeccable. Even their breathing seemed choreographed.



"Levi!" the mother called, "Come and get your pizza!"



A door opened upstairs, and I heard the patter of small feet on the stairs. Then a child appeared, a boy, about eight years old, with brown curly hair and bright green eyes.



Except he was walking on all fours.



He scampered down the stairs like a dog, then stood upright at the bottom, but his posture was all wrong, his spine curved and stiff, not at all like a human spine. He grinned at me, revealing slightly pointed teeth.



"Pizza!" he said. His voice sounded normal, like a child's, with the enthusiasm children have for pizza. "Did you order extra cheese?"



"Levi, mind your manners," the father said. "Speak in your normal voice."



"I am using my normal voice," Levi said, then dropped to all fours again and trotted to the table. He jumped onto a chair and sat down like a dog, his hind legs tucked beneath him.



The mother laughed, her laughter like wind chimes. “He’s still learning.  Kids, you know.”



I didn’t know what to say. The little booklet was blank. There were no rules here.



Levi opened the pizza box with his teeth, his hands, which looked remarkably human, apparently just for show, and pulled out a slice. He devoured it messily but happily, like a child should eat pizza.



Then he looked at me, tilting his head like a curious puppy. “Are you the delivery guy? The one who goes to those strange places?”



“I… yes.”



“Cool.” He jumped down from the chair, landing on all fours and crawling towards me. “My family are all humans, like you. I miss them sometimes.”



The parents exchanged a glance. The other two children, I now realized, hadn’t moved or said a word, still wearing their perfect smiles.



“Levy, don’t bother this kind deliveryman,” the father said.



“I’m not bothering him.” Levi squatted in front of me, looking up with his unnaturally bright green eyes. “I’m not bothering you, am I?”



“No, I don’t feel bothered.”



“Good.” He stood up, walking on two legs, which seemed to be a struggle, as if walking on two legs wasn’t natural for him. “I want to ask you something. Can you adopt me?”



The room fell silent.



“Levi…” the mother began.



“I don’t belong here,” Levi’s voice suddenly became old and sad. “They’re not my parents. They’re nice, but they’re not right. They don’t have skin under their faces. They don’t eat, they just push the food around on their plates. I’m different from them. I’m something else. Something in between.”



He took my hand with his small, very human-like hand. “You provide a service for beings like me. Beings that aren’t quite human, and not quite something else. You’re also in between. I can smell it on you—gardens, hospitals, castles. You’ve walked in both worlds. So maybe you can… maybe I can…”



“Do you want to come with me?” I finished, trembling. He nodded frantically. “Please. I’ll be good. I’ll follow the rules. I can help with deliveries. I’m very good at sniffing out things people don’t want found. Please.”



The mother, father, and son stood up in unison. Their voices, when they spoke, were jarringly harmonious: “The child has made his request. This is his right, and your obligation. Do you accept?”



I looked down at Levi, this strange boy, eating pizza, walking on all fours, desperately trying to escape this place. The manual was blank, because there were no rules for this situation. I was on my own.



“I need to make a call,” I said.



I went outside and dialed the emergency contact number Marcus had given me, the one for situations not covered in the manual.



A woman’s voice answered, cold and professional. “Support. What’s the problem?”



“I’m on a delivery. 4782 Oakwood Avenue. The customer…is a child. He wants me to adopt him.”



There was a moment of silence on the other end. Then: “Please hold.”



Background music came on. I heard a scream in the background, or maybe it was just static.



Marcus picked up the phone. “Eric, what exactly did the kid say?”



“He said he wants me to adopt him. He said these aren’t his real parents. He’s somewhere in between.”



“What about the child’s parents?Did them say anything?”



“They asked me if I would adopt him. They said it’s his right, and my obligation.”



Another silence. I could hear Marcus’s slow, steady breathing. “This is unusual, but not unprecedented. What does your gut tell you?”



I looked back at the house. Through the window, I saw Levi sitting on the floor, looking at me with his bright eyes, his tail,when did he grow a tail?wagging hopefully.



“My gut tells me he’s telling the truth. And that he needs help.”



“Then trust your gut. In this business, instinct is sometimes more important than the rules.” Marcus paused. “If you accept, he’ll be under your care. The company will provide accommodation, and we have facilities specifically for handling special circumstances. But you’ll need to take him out on weekends, help him socialize, and teach him how to blend in as a human when necessary. You can think of it as being a foster parent, except this child is a shapeshifter who might accidentally eat you if he gets too excited. But I advise you to accept.”



“That’s insane.”



“That’s the job,” Marcus’s smile came through the phone. “So, what are you going to do?”



He didn’t really give me a choice.



“I accept.”



“Good. Bring him to the warehouse after the delivery. We’ll get a room ready for him.” He hung up.



I went back inside. Levi was already standing at the door, bouncing with excitement.



“Really? You said yes?”



“I said yes.”



He threw his arms around me—they were definitely arms now—hugging my waist so tightly I could barely breathe. “Thank you, thank you, thank you. I’ll be good. I promise. You won’t regret it.”



The child’s parents were back at their seats at the dinner table. I watched as their expressions shifted, their features rearranging themselves into different shapes, like someone shuffling a deck of cards.



“The child is yours now,” they said in unison. “The contract is fulfilled, the debt is settled.”



“What contract?”



But they had already turned away, continuing their charade of a “family dinner,” the other two children still maintaining their perfect smiles.



Levi grabbed my hand—it was definitely a hand now, warm and human—and pulled me towards the door. “Let’s go! Can we get ice cream? Do you have any other pets? Are there other people like me where we’re going?”



“Slow down,” I said, but a smile involuntarily spread across my face. “One question at a time.”



As we walked towards my car, he chattered incessantly, sometimes walking on two legs, sometimes on four, his posture shifting with his level of excitement. The other people on the street didn’t seem to notice anything unusual. Maybe they only saw an ordinary boy. Maybe only people like me, those who have crossed too many boundaries, could perceive this strangeness. After we got in the car, Biscuit, who had been sleeping in the back seat, sat up. He and Levi stared at each other for a long time.



Then, Levi's tail reappeared, wagging wildly, and Biscuit's tail started wagging too.



“A dog! You have a dog! I love dogs! Well, sometimes I feel like a dog myself, but I like other dogs too!”



“His name is Biscuit.”



“Biscuit,” Levi repeated respectfully, “That’s a nice name. Can I pet him?”



“Yes.”



On the way to the warehouse, Levi petted Biscuit and talked to him about the terrible fake family, pizza, and his new life.  That's when I glanced at the pocket watch on the passenger seat. The picture had changed again.



In the picture, Biscuit, Levi, and I were sitting in a room I didn't recognize at all. We all looked happy. But in the doorway behind us, hidden in the shadows, was that tall figure again. He was watching us. Always watching.



My phone buzzed. “$87.50 deposited into your account. Note: A weekly $200 guardian allowance will be used to care for the dependent. Welcome to foster care, E, don’t mess it up.”



That last sentence was definitely Marcus’s style of humor.



The warehouse had some areas I had never been allowed into before. Marcus led us through a series of doors, each marked with symbols that were unsettling to look at, until we came to a corridor that seemed longer than the building's exterior dimensions.



“Room 13,” Marcus said, opening a door. “Fitting, isn’t it?”



The room next door was much larger than it should have been, practically a complete apartment with a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, and living room. The walls were padded, looking like wallpaper. The view outside the window was definitely not the industrial area where the warehouse was located; instead, there were mountains, forests, and a night sky with three moons.



“The padding is because he might have episodes,” Marcus explained. “Shapeshifters his age sometimes lose control when they get emotional. This scenery is meant to make him feel less trapped. He can't actually enter the human world; it's just a projection of his. But it does help.”



Levi had already started exploring, running around the room, occasionally dropping to all fours in his excitement, his form shifting between that of a boy and something more canine.



“What exactly is he?” I asked.



“A changeling, half Shapeshifters nby the old definition. A human child taken by a non-human creature, raised between the two worlds until he is neither human nor that thing… but the family you met, they're collectors. They take or buy special children like him and treat them as… curiosities, pets, status symbols.” Marcus's face darkened."Calm down. You were right to take him away. Otherwise, he would stay there forever, slowly forgetting what it feels like to be human."



"How old is he?"



"It's hard to say. Time flows differently for his family. He could be eight, or he could be eighty. His body will age, but very slowly, incredibly slowly." Marcus handed me a key. "This place is yours now too. You can visit him anytime. But you need to take him out on weekends, let him socialize, and teach him how to maintain his human form for extended periods. And, whatever you do, don't let him near a casino."



"Why?"



"Shapeshifters are banned from all casinos in this city and he is under 18. It's a long story. It involves three poker games, an ace, and an angry mob boss who still doesn't know he lost to a ten-year-old kid who could see through the cards." Marcus chuckled. "That was actually your father. He agreed to stay, and I wanted to assign him a very important task as a test, but he said he had children at home, so I gave him a regular job. Maybe he was bored, or maybe he was greedy, but he worked with a shapeshifter named Thomas for a while, and they did quite well. Until Thomas got too greedy and revealed his true form when he shouldn't have. I haven't seen him since."



My heart sank. "My father worked with a shapeshifter?"



"That's right. This is the debt he owed, and it's the debt you inherited because he's no longer in the system. Thomas belonged to a family, and shapeshifters value family ties. After he disappeared, his family members came looking for him. Your father owed them a life for a life. He tried other solutions, but since he couldn't repay..." Marcus looked at me meaningfully, and there was definitely a large part he wasn't telling me. I could imagine they wouldn't accept the eldest son as collateral. “My initial thought was to fire him. Well, he said he had a son, and his son couldn't be without a father. So, sigh... And then he said he wanted to ask me for one last gamble. I haven't encountered such a fun situation in hundreds of years. Most people facing death wouldn't put 20 years of their life on the table for another round.”



I should have stopped there, but the situation made it hard for me to stop, so I asked him what exactly he was playing.



“Ars Secreta Triplicis, I don't want to explain the specific rules to you. It's a combination of dice and cards; I played it with some leaders at a company retreat. The stakes weren't cash, definitely not. In 700 years, I've never seen a tie.  At the time, we gambled 20 years of life, 5 million, and a shapeshifter's tail, which is very useful for navigation. The result was that we played for about a night, and it was a tie three times. I've never seen so many ties in 700 years. So we...”



“My father chose the 5 million, not the 20 years of life,” I concluded, stating the obvious.



“Yes, I chose the shapeshifter's tail. Very useful. Then I told him to take the 5 million and get lost, never to come back. Because I knew the debt wasn't settled yet, it's just that the shapeshifter couldn't take his life...” He didn't elaborate further.



“Okay, so now you've adopted half a shapeshifter. So I guess you don't have to worry about them abandoning unwanted children on your doorstep someday?”



“Are you saying this is destiny?”



“I mean, the universe has its own sense of irony.” He turned to leave, then stopped. “One more thing. Levi will consider you his own. That's how shapeshifters are; they will completely and absolutely bond with a person. You will become his support, his leader, his family. Don't underestimate this trust. If you betray this trust...”



“What?”



“Shapeshifters remember everything. And they live for a very, very long time to plan their revenge.” He gave that Cheshire Cat grin.



Marcus left, and I stood at the door, watching Levi explore his new home. He found a pile of plush toys in the bedroom and was arranging them in a circle, talking to each toy in a different voice. “Hey, Levi?”



He looked up, his eyes sparkling. “Hmm?”



“We’ll be okay. You and me. I promise.”



But I wasn’t really sure we would be okay. Because as I said those words, he smile in a real sharp teeth.



This might be really short this time. Because if you’ve ever taken care of a seven-year-old shapeshifting child, you’d know they’re about twice as difficult to handle as a normal child, especially when you’re surrounded by anywhere from one to thirty ice cream cones while trying to eat ice cream. But I’ll try to make it longer next time.
