THE VENT

As told by the Reverend of Horror

I used to live in this beat-up condo on the edge of town. Quiet place. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that’s not peaceful—it’s hollow. Nothing around for miles. Just a dying gas station, a liquor store that smelled like old regret, and my building... rotting from the inside.

It was cheap, which should’ve told me everything I needed to know.

The walls creaked like old bones. Floors moaned every time I walked. You could feel the age in the place. The only neighbor I ever saw was this woman in 2B. Didn’t speak. Just stared. Like she was waiting for something. Fidgeted like her skin didn’t fit right.

She always came out when I was dragging the trash down. Pale. Still. Standing too close, too quiet. I didn’t like it. Gut said no. I trust my gut.

Then the footsteps started.

Every damn night, just as I started to drift off—tap tap tap above me. Sometimes soft, sometimes angry, like whatever it was had somewhere to be and no patience getting there.

I figured it was raccoons in the attic or something. Old place like that, I wouldn’t be surprised. So I knocked on her door—2B. Asked her if she heard anything.

She smiled without showing teeth and said, “I sleep like a rock.”

Yeah. Sure.

The noises didn’t stop. Week went by, and I started noticing other things. Little things. Subtle. But wrong.

My keys weren’t where I left them. Fridge was off—like, literally moved. Not a lot, maybe an inch, but enough to piss me off. A picture on the wall? Upside down.

That’s when I knew it wasn’t animals.

Then came the morning that twisted everything.

I woke up to find my clothes laid out at the foot of the bed. Folded. Neat. Like a damn hotel turndown service.

Except I live alone.

My chest was tight. Felt like my lungs were trying to climb out through my ribs. I scanned the room. Listened. Waited. Nothing.

But someone had been in my apartment.

That night, I bought cameras. No more guessing.

One in the kitchen. One in the hallway. Two in the bedroom. One in the living room. Covered every inch of that place like a fortress. Last one I set up was behind the bookshelf. As I secured it, I muttered, “Let’s see what you’re up to now…”

Then, just loud enough to sting:
“Creepy bitch.”

A week passed. Silence. No footsteps. No missing shit. No clothes. Nothing.

Too quiet.

Eventually, I stopped checking the feeds. Forgot they were even running.

A month later, it came back.

THUD.
Loud. Violent. Right above my bed.

I shot up, flicked the lamp on, heart pounding like war drums. That sound had weight. Not just noise—presence.

I ran to my computer and pulled the footage.

Kitchen cam. 3:47 AM.

The vent on the wall started to shift. Slow. Real slow.

Then a hand came out.

Thin. Pale. Not human.

Then another.

She crawled out. Didn’t even look like she moved—more like she unfolded. Long limbs bending wrong, hips twisting like her bones didn’t have rules.

She didn’t fall. She hung, like gravity hadn’t made up its mind yet.

Then she flipped. Landed silent. Started walking through my place like she owned it.

She ate my leftovers.

Opened my drawers.

Sat on my couch like she was channel surfing.

Then the hallway feed blinked on.

She crept to my bedroom.

Just stood there. Watched me sleep.

Didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Then she walked into the kitchen. Opened the drawer.

Took out a butcher knife.

Came back.

The bedroom feed lit up. She was standing over me. Knife in hand. Watching.

Then she raised it.

And acted like she was cutting.

Not once. Over and over.

Like she was rehearsing.

When she was done, she laid my clothes out on the chair. Cleaned the knife.

And right before she crawled back into the vent, she turned to the camera.

Smiled. Wide. Twisted. Like her face didn’t come built for it.

Then she waved.

Click.

Vent snapped shut.

I shoved away from the desk, heart trying to rip itself out of my chest. My chair hit the floor. I turned toward the living room and she was already there.

Mid-air.

Coming straight for me.

And then
Black.


The end
