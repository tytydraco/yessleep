***** is for my last name. ** is for the first two letters of my first. @ is used to seperate usernames for domain. The ************.org is for my school. The 25 is for the year I graduate. 

When you are younger, you don't see the big things in the little. U just see it. You don't absorb stuff often, you are just experiencing. I don't know when the flip switched. I don't know when I grew up. 

I think life is pretty simple, I don't like over complicating things. People think too hard sometimes, and thinking too hard is not good for you. When I think too hard, I start thinking more. You start asking questions. You start adopting. You start realizing things that are questionable, and those things repeat that cycle. I do not now what goes on when it ends. 

I don't know if I will wake up tommorow. Nothing in life is certain, and the only thing you can do is wake or die. 

From the ages of baby to let's say like kindergarten, I feel like your life is a fog. A flash, a seemingly recapping montage of your toddler ship. Then one day, a flip is switched. it's like you exist for the first time, besides being born. You experience things you don't appreciate till after. Moments becomes past tense. Memories become nostalgia. You live not knowing this will only happen one time in all of everything. 

It sounds corny, but it's true. Like why tf humans cringe, but fuck man I cringe. Fuck I laughed. I laugh I lot bro, I've been angry a lot
Bro, I've fucked up a lot. U can fuck up but what can u do? Only keep going. 

Alr back on track on whatever fucking derailed shit I'm typing. I'm def not the first to think
This, some fucking Aristotle ass newton mfs were def deep thinking this in thier sanctuary. Or maybe another medival kid who honestly just had whys with no becauses, who is living life but doesn't know why. 

Humans come from monkeys right? Why did we grow so intelligent? Were they conscious like us too? 

The brain releases DMT when u die. They say u have a recap of your entire life and your modified. Basically like ‚Äúyour life flashing before you die‚Äù. I think this is true. What if I'm facing it rn?

I see a lot of homeless. He had a dog. I wanted to give him money but I didn't. On the drive back, I picture myself. In his shoes. Next to a highway exit. In the August sun in black pants and a jacket. Was that all he had to wear? Must be sweating crazy?! His dog looks happy. Or maybe he was thirsty. You really don't know. Life is based on perspective. When you live life you live it through a perspective. Life can become whatever you want, you just have to see it the way you want to. The guy who invented socks was probably seen as crazy?! Now look where socks r today. Above my ankles. In my drawer. Each sock is different. Nike, puma, adidas, all from the same factory. The procreation of a child beneath a human being? I bet they don't even own the socks they make.

No such thing. I wish I could live a thousand different lives, but I only see out of my eyes. I can only exist as one person.

The days seem long, until they aren't. The day seems long until it becomes days. A week seems long until Sunday night. Months seem long until the 1st. Years seem long until ur sitting in ur bed writing at 2:41 am.
It's everybody's first time living. What happened to the people who are dead? Probably nothing. Only thing that's for certain is u waking up. You can feel, you can smell, hear, see, think, touch, taste, you can live. Take it for what it is. An experience. Don't think about memories and get nostalgic. Think life as one big memory. U r only wasting time teminicisng. Go live. When rents due. Leave with no regrets.

25, two numbers. The number two 

The numbers 2 and 5 can have different meanings depending on the context:

1. **Mathematics**: 
   - **2** is the first even prime number, and it often symbolizes duality, balance, or partnership.
   - **5** is the third prime number and can represent change, freedom, or adventure.

2. **Numerology**:
   - **2** is often associated with harmony, cooperation, and sensitivity.
   - **5** is associated with dynamism, adaptability, and curiosity.

3. **General Context**:
   - **2** and **5** can be used as ordinal numbers (second and fifth) or to represent quantities, counts, or identifiers.
   - They can also be part of larger symbolic systems, such as in sports (jersey numbers), culture (dates, lucky numbers), or literature.

The meaning depends heavily on where and how these numbers are used.

Meaning depends on how it's used. Life has no meaning because meaning is meaningless without meaning. Everything is counterintuitive. Just fucking go to bed.
