Near the bar area of ​​my city you can find a corridor hidden among the buildings that will take you to an area not well known to the public, on the north wall of this "bubble" within the block, is my work, the only place in this place an old bar, with an emphasis on "old", it's not a very big bar, we have capacity for only 13 people, not many people visit us and only 2 people work here, Rocco and me.

I prepare the drinks and serve the customers while Rocco prepares the appetizers, yes, we sell appetizers, from simple bar peanuts to pure Italian-style calamari fritti, but in this place we have special rules for customers, one of them is that if Rocco knows how to prepare a dish that is not on the menu, we will prepare the dish for the customer and mark it as "special dish".

I like to say that we are a dynamic duo, although I can rarely see his face beyond the window that leads to the kitchen, besides that Rocco is not very talkative, or rather, he does not speak at all.

 but that doesn't matter, this bar is a very pathetic one, old bottles decorate the place next to dark wooden walls and a slight smell of cigarettes (which is weird because I don't let anyone smoke inside the bar), a bar for 5 people and 2 4 person tables are all the places we have but not a problem we could never fill the place anyway a dusty pool table in the center of the place is the only means of entertainment for the patrons and to end the tour, a bathroom, where I'm sure more than one person died.

It is all you can see in this place, nothing more, not for nothing we don't have many clients, of course, that and our "style" does not combine well with our hours or location.

our shift is from 10 at night to 6 in the morning, so I don't have much free time at night, I sleep almost all day and at this point you could say that my best friends are: Rocco, the chair that I have behind the bar and our radio.

This place is the strangest and most boring, that is why I am starting this diary, for lack of things to do I just have to record my days working in this bar, that or try to guess how many jelly beans we have in the jar, It's not like I can see my phone, there's almost no signal here, we don't have internet and our only means of communication is a landline phone that costs a coin per minute, so my phone is useless in this place.

If you manage to find this place and make the decision to enter this bar, you will always see me there, standing at the bar waiting for clients, with a bored look lost in my thoughts, you will be able to see Rocco's torso leaning out of the kitchen window, almost always with a cookbook in his hands, I don't know if it's an admirable work ethic or he's just as bored as me.

but anyway, i spend every day, tuesday to sunday, working from 10 to 6, in this place, i'm the weird guy who makes the drinks and takes the orders, everyone calls me “Peter”, even if that's not my name, if you come to my bar and you are the first to show this post I will buy you a drink, it is not easy to find us if you do not know the area, but if one day you enter a corridor and at the end you see a bar with the neon sign that says “Ghost Apple”, congratulations, you made it to the worst bar in town, where a loser and a giant will serve you tonight!.

Tonight's specialty is:
nothing, we are closed
