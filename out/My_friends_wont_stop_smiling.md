Im sitting in some abandoned Cabin in the Forest, The Police wont come to help since they think i've gone insane, My friends are nothing more then Shells if what they used to be and i'm certain i won't make it out, so i at least want to warn people, incase this isn't all just a nightmare. I will try my best to explain it but i'm shaking and fearing for my life.

It all started on a camping trip with a few of my closest friends, after we all finished school we haven't seen each other much besides birthdays and via Discord-Group call evenings.Young people all getting into the serious part of life. All off us freed up a weekend and decided to pack up just the essentials:
one tent per two of us so three in total
a camping heater for some food,
flashlights and an emergency phone (from which i am currently writing)
and Sleeping bags

The Plan was to get away from the stress of Work and hang out with each other on the Schwarzwald, yk these typical leave-everything-unnecessary-behind-trips, they usually help to reduce stress and focus on the simple things, well this one probably killed us all.

After setting up our tents and igniting a campfire for the night we all sat around it on the ground and talked about whats currently going on, old school times, whatever we could imagine. The talks got more absurd the longer the joint passed around in the group, but hey thats the fun of it. Just as Elijah, my best friend who i still see regular despite our full schedules, was talking about this Girl he was currently seeing, i saw him grinning in the faint light from the fire, but it didn't stop there, the corners of his mouth kept rising, almost inhumane? 
In the moment i was slightly freaked out, but assured myself i was just imagining things in the dim light, 'maybe the marijuhana played a part too, i haven't smoked in quite some time', i thought to myself. Oh how insanely wrong i was, but i just didn't know any better. 

After a bit more talking, we all decided it was time to head into our tents and end the day. After pouring a bucket of water over the camping fire and climbing into our Sleeping bags, we all we're fast asleep.

Suddenly i was shaken awake by my Friend Caleb, with who i was sharing a tent.I could see through the net of our tent that i was ever so slightly bright outside, like the sun was just rising. "Dude, you need to come outside, the dawn looks awesome here", he said, also still half-asleep. Since i didn't feel tired anymore i decided to get up and follow him outside.

We walked a few steps to a nearby tiny cliff where the whole sky could be seen, but till then i was barley awake enough to walk there so when i looked up for the first time, i noticed it: This wasn't the rising sun, the sky was blueish purple with a giant Black ball surrounded by white light which was bright enough to simulate a small sun, i've never seen anything like this before, much less did i knew what that was. "Caleb, dude what is that?!" I asked, looking him in the face for the first time since i woke up, and there was it again: This Grin i thought i imagined on Elijahs face at the Campfire, but now it was much clearer, the skin of his cheeks was pulled up so far, i could see the tears and the muscle under, like someone forced it to his eyes. He looked directly at me with this grin and empty eyes, behind him still the unexplainable sky-phenomenon, and he was walking towards me. My instinct told me to run, which i did, till i tripped on a Tree root which was sticking out of the ground. As soon as my face hit the ground i woke up.

Drenched in sweat i was lying in my tent, alone. Outside it must have already been late morning if not midday. I could hear my friends outside talking and laughing. All i could think was 'What the hell was that...'. After a few more moments processing my nightmare, i sat up and opened the zipper of the tent to be greeted with "Damn someones finally up as well, Elijah wants to get some water to cook from a nearby lake, why don't you go with him?" from Selina, the girl who used to sit next to me in pretty much every lesson, now the Girlfriend of Caleb. "Uh.. let me wake up some more first.." is all i could mumble while rubbing my eyes.

About two hours later, after a much-needed change of clothes and some canned corn as my breakfast, i set off with Elijah to a small lake we passed yesterday while searching for a spot to set up camp. I didn't talk to anyone about my nightmare, although it surely was a strange coincidence, or atleast thats what i thought just a few hours ago. We walked for quite a while, even tho i was sure the lake was barley a few minutes away. "Yo Elijah you sure this is the right way", i asked slightly pissed off since i expected this to be a quick trip. He didn't answer and kept walking straight ahead. "Elijah? Im sure we are going the wrong way", i tried to get his attention, again with no luck, as he even sped up now. I was done chasing him in silence and grabbed him by the shoulder to turn him to face me, there it was again. 


This time right in front of my eyes, no drugs in my system, no nightmare, no imagination in dim light. This time his grin, the corners of his mouth bleeding cracked, his eyes empty. I could see his full upper gums and the skin on his cheeks was slightly torn and strained. I backed away in shock:" Elijah what are you doing?! What the fuck man, how did that happen?!" I yelled at him. 
No answer.
Nothing.
He just looked at me with empty eyes.
"THIS IS  NOT FUCKING FUNNY" I screamed in his face: "WHATEVER SICK PRANK THIS IS, IM NOT PUTTING UP WITH IT", turning around and walking away, back to our Camp. I heard branches cracking behind me, 'fuck fuck fuck is this an other nightmare, what the hell', is all that ran through my head, whatever this was, its not Elijah and it was chasing me. I ran with all the air i had left and saw our campfire. "YO GUYS QUICK I NEED THE PHONE, ELIJAH IS ACTING WEIRD".

There were they, all standing around the little cooking station we had build yesterday noon, the same grin my dearest Childhood friend had to, all looking at me with empty eyes, grunting stuff i couldn't understand. At this point i was purely running off instincts, grabbing the emergency we had sitting on a tree-stump as a clock. I just ran away, dialing 911. *beep,beep*
I ran and ran explaining my situation to the operator till i found the little cabin I'm sitting in right now, only 3 walls are left, the wood moldy and foul-smelling. She explained i'm just insane and hung up. I hear the loud grunting of the shells of my friends, they found me, its over for me

EDIT: Elijah here. We are fine, as far as can be at least. To make this short, Kian was suddenly scared of me on our walk, i didn't understand why he screamed at me and ran so i followed him, after he ran away and took the phone from camp, we all scattered and tried to find him, after the police and emergency services arrived, all we found was a passed out Kian with this post next to him. Turns out he didn't take his Psychosis medication, none of us even knew he has Psychosis. The weed in his system triggered a real bad episode, he's currently home again with his Girlfriend. I really hope he's gonna be okay after reading his descriptions of what he saw, this must have been pure horror.
