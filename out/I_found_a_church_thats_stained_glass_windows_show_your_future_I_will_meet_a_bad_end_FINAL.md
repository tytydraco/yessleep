[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11aqoki/i_found_a_church_thats_stained_glass_windows_show/)

For hours Amber and I sat on the tailgate of my truck smoking her cigarettes and doing our best not to look at the skeletal church just ahead of us. When I asked why she was there, she just kept repeating that she was supposed to meet me. I asked her to elaborate, but she said it wouldn’t make sense. I did my best to let it go, but the vagueness festered in my mind.

She was the daughter of Trevor Bate’s youngest brother. Since the youngest age she could remember, her family would only talk about him in hushed tones. Whenever she saw photos of him and asked her parents to tell them more about him, they changed the subject. A missing family member was always a delicate subject, but Trevor Bates had been the first of many disappearances from that damned place and the family wore it around their necks like an albatross.

Stories of her lost uncle followed her all through her school years as well. Children teased her and teachers seemed to interact with her as little as necessary. The girl grew up like an outcast based on small-town superstition. I nodded and smoked as she told me about those troublesome years.

“I met a nice boy in high school, though,” she said with a smile. “Michael Baxter. We were only seventeen, but I thought we may get married, ya know?”

His name struck my brain like a bolt of lightning. Michael Baxter had gone missing seven years ago at Old Salem. A few high school seniors camped out probably fifty feet from where we sat on the tailgate of my truck. When the boys woke up the next morning, Michael was gone and the doors to the old church were pushed inward.

*No foul play suspected*, his file had said.

“I met my wife when I was seventeen,” I said through a lump in my throat. “The sting never really goes away when you lose someone.”

Amber looked at me in confusion. I could tell she wondered how I knew about Michael, so I tapped my badge sitting between us to silently indicate where I had gotten the information. She smiled at me sadly and nodded before lighting up another cigarette.

“I need to get going,” she said as her shoes made contact with the hardpacked dirt. “It was nice to meet you.”

“Amber… Italy,” I called out as she walked back to her car. “How did you know you’d meet me here?”

She sat in her car and fired the engine. 

“I went inside after Michael vanished,” she said, pointing toward the church through her open car door. “Saw it in the stained glass.”

“What did you see?” I croaked. My pulse skyrocketed and I could feel hot blood and the pounding of my heart in my ears.

“Don’t go inside, Henry,” she called back. “I think that’s what the last window wanted me to tell you.”

“What did you see?” I screamed at her, but it was too late. Amber shut the door of her car and hammered the ignition down the rough path. I watched as the pillars of dust floated into the air and her taillights broke the fallen darkness of the evening.

I would find out later that like so many others, no one ever spoke with Amber again. Her blue Ford Taurus was discovered twenty miles out of town on the side of the Pennyrile Parkway. I never saw the report, but I always wondered what it said.

Probably *No foul play suspected*.

Amber had left the rest of her pack of cigarettes on the tailgate and I sat in the dark, smoking them all and gazing at the edifice of Old Salem Church. Headlights shot through the dilapidated structure from the parkway nearby giving it the illusion that dark things moved between the wooden boards of the wall. I knew I should get in my car and go home, but I wanted to go inside and see the place for myself.

I wanted evidence.

Pulling open the rusting toolbox in the bed of my truck, I grabbed a flashlight and a crowbar. I slipped on the light and aimed it at the church, bile roiling in my guts. As I began to walk toward the door, I felt like a child scared of the darkness. There was no sensible reason to be filled with so much dread.

I pushed against the door expecting some resistance from the warped frame, but to my surprise, it pushed open gently. Rows of splintering pews filled the sanctuary inside, washed in the moonlight that filtered in through the patchwork of holes in the roof. An old coat rack draped in tattered cloth leaned haphazardly against the pulpit looking like an otherworldly minister.

Framing both sides of the sanctuary were ornate stained glass windows that seemed almost to glow through the darkness inside. The flashlight and crowbar tumbled from my hand as I shuffled forward in a trance. They were captivating.

On the left, nearest to the door was a scene of a young boy and a dog playing in front of the stream. It was Gilligan, my first pet. We played together every day after school until he was hit by a car.

Next to it was an image of me during a high school baseball game. The number 3 was emblazoned on the back of my jersey and a bat dangled from my right hand as I watched the ball soar through the air. It was the only homerun I ever hit and the coach screamed at me to run for home.

A third was of Rose and me beneath a concrete angel, kissing in the moonlight. Tears filled my eyes at the glass image of my wife, so young and beautiful in my arms. Happiness and sorrow swirled through my veins.

Casting my eyes to the other wall, the window farthest away showed me a vision of myself at the police academy graduation ceremony. I was young, thin, and so proud that day. Still so unaware of how that job would keep me away from the woman I loved.

In the center, two people sat on the tailgate of an old pickup smoking cigarettes. It was the perfect image of that very afternoon as I sat talking to Amber. The white glass of her smile glinted in my eyes. I hadn’t noticed her smile as we talked, but she must have. Some happy memory in her ocean of sadness had won over her for just a moment.

My eyes drifted to the floor for a moment as the buzz of tinnitus filled my ears. The next window would be the one to show me the future. I had hoped that much like Amber, I would be allowed to leave that wretched place, unlike so many others. Truly though, I feared the window would show me what had taken so many others before.

With a sigh of horror and resignation, I looked toward the sixth window.

There was an old man, a mop of white hair swept to the side, sitting on one of the church pews. Bright reds, yellows, and oranges came together to create a wall of flames behind him. Dark figures stood in the blaze, looking down at the forlorn man.

Looking down at me.

I turned and ran for the door and burst into the cool evening air and soothing moonlight. My heart thundered as my feet hammered against the ground toward my truck. Fumbling the keys from my pocket, I jumped in the seat and readied myself to get as far away from that dark place as I could.

Then I realized my hair had been white on the last window. It had shown me well into old age. Salt and pepper danced across my once dark mane, but it was far from white. The last window didn’t represent that day, but I felt in the pit of my soul that the horrible image would someday come to pass.

In a stupor, I got out of the truck and headed back to the bed. A dented red gas can sat near the toolbox and I pulled it over the edge. I wanted the madness to stop then and there. If Old Salem Church burnt that night, there would be no white-haired version of myself to burn there in the future. No more missing kids either.

I’d gladly pay whatever price came my way. 

The gas soaked quickly into the dry wood of the church walls. I emptied the entire canister and tossed it inside. The loud *clang* when the metal hit the sagging wooden floors made me wince. Without another thought, I pulled Amber’s abandoned lighter from my pocket and struck the flint next to the wood.

Flames erupted quickly and I walked back to the truck and drove away. Reds, oranges, and yellows licked at the night sky in my rearview mirror. I laughed and then burst into tears.

*It’s over*, I told myself. *No more disappearances. No future in the flames.*

I wish I’d been right.

I spent the rest of the night drinking scotch by the police scanner in my garage. Chatter was minimal during that night. My anxiety increased with every passing minute as I waited to hear someone report the fire on Parkway #3 Road. It had been nearly midnight when I got home and by 3 AM there still hadn’t been a peep.

Part of me was relieved thinking that somehow no one from the parkway had seen the flames. Maybe it burnt so quickly that no one even saw it to call in. Even if it was reported, the blaze would have gone on so long there would be nothing of the structure to salvage.

Another part worried that the flames had gone out. I knew it was impossible, but still, I worried.

Sleep came hard in the early hours. As soon as I woke up, I turned the scanner volume up, but there was still no word of a fire in Crenshaw. My stomach sat heavy and a new sense of dread washed over my body.

I got in the truck and drove as quickly as I could to Parkway #3 Road and down the twisting drag. There were no fire trucks or emergency vehicles. No smoke. Only the line of trees blocking the view where the church would have stood.

Above the trees like a craning vulture, I saw the steeple of Old Salem Church; unburnt and waiting for new carrion

Whoever finds these pages, I just want you to understand what has happened to me. I burnt down Old Salem Church for the first time in 1995. It was standing in the same spot the next day as though nothing had happened at all. I felt insane, but I came to accept that the hateful place holds some terrible grip there. Something there hungers for the lives it snatches away.

I burnt it again five more times over the years, but no matter how much gas I pour or even if I stand there to watch that hellish frame crumble in on itself during the blaze, it’ll be standing again the next day. It seems indomitable. A bastion of despair and hopelessness.

My hair has long since gone white and I’m tired. Children still vanish in the area and each time it happens I slip a bit further into madness. No one listens to me when I beg them to demolish the place. County costs are too high, they say. Putting up a gated fence or sealing off the road is out of the budget.

Perhaps Old Salem gave me the answer though.

Maybe it just wants me.

I’ve watched the place burn five times standing on the gravel drive and once in the rearview mirror of my old truck. It never works. I’ve been going about it all wrong.

The sixth window showed me sitting inside, wreathed in flames. So I’ll give that vile building what it wants. There are six cans of gas in the truck and I plan to douse the whole place. I’ll sit inside and wait for those dark figures to watch me burn. Maybe that’ll be the end of all this.

If I’m gone tomorrow and Old Salem Church is still standing, God help you all.
