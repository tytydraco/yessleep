Two weeks ago, I saw her again—the girl I don’t remember, but who knows me too well.



I was walking down a street in my grandmother’s village. There was a girl walking beside me—blue dress, orange hair. 

I can't clearly remember her face. We walked past the park and headed down a road lined with trees on both sides. 

A couple of minutes later, we arrived at a graveyard surrounded by stone walls. They were a little taller than me and had some kind of engravings on them.



We stepped inside, and it looked like a normal graveyard filled with old headstones. The girl didn’t speak, and I didn’t feel like I needed to either. 

I wasn’t scared—if anything, it felt peaceful. Familiar.



Then I woke up.



It was an interesting dream, but nothing too strange. I didn’t think much of it—until two days later, during lunch at work. 

A random thought hit me: that graveyard felt real. Not just real… familiar. But I couldn’t place it. I’d been visiting my grandmother’s village every summer until I was fifteen. 

I thought maybe it was a memory. I checked the area on the map—zoomed around every corner of that place, looking for it.



Nothing.



Maybe the map data was outdated. That happens, right? Some old places don’t show up. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, though. So I decided to take a couple days off and visit my grandma.



That evening, I packed a bag and drove down. It’s only two hours away—easy. I got there around 9 PM. Grandma was surprised but happy to see me. We sat down, drank tea, caught up.



I didn’t tell her the real reason I came. That night, I had the dream again. It was almost exactly the same—except this time, I remembered her face.



Bright blue eyes. Orange hair. A small scar on her nose. Pale skin with freckles.



She felt familiar. But also like someone I didn’t know.



I woke up with a strange, distressed feeling. Grandma was already up—noises coming from downstairs and the smell of something amazing. I ate breakfast, and she poured us coffee. We sat down, and I asked:



“Grandma, I want to visit the graveyard.”



“Sure. Why do you want to go?”



“I want to visit Grandfather.”



“Oh, I get it, son. When do you want to go?”



“Right after this coffee, Grandma.”



“Alright. As you want.”



I finished my coffee and left the house. As I got closer to the street from my dream, I realized—it was exactly the same. The park was there. The buildings were in place. Everything matched.



I entered the tree-lined road and kept walking.



But when I reached the spot where the graveyard should’ve been—there were only trees. Just forest. I kept walking. Nothing. I felt weird—scared, confused.



On the way back, I saw an old friend walking. At first, he didn’t notice me, but I called out:



“Henry!”



He looked over, surprised, and walked toward me. He smiled, hugged me, and asked:



“Taylor! What brings you here?”



“I’m visiting Grandma.”



“Oh, nice! Good to see you after all these years.”



“Thanks, nice to see you too.”



“Where are you coming from?”



“I was trying to visit Grandfather’s grave, but… I guess I forgot where the graveyard was.”



“Let me take you there—we can catch up on the way.”



“Sure, let’s go.”



We walked for ten minutes. He led me to the graveyard. It was in a place I didn’t remember at all. I paid my respects at Grandfather’s grave, then said goodbye to Henry and returned home.



Grandma brought out a large photo album that evening. Old, worn leather cover—full of childhood pictures.



“Oh, Grandma, this again?”



“Come on, son. You know I love these. Let’s take a look.”



I sat beside her as she flipped through the pages. Photos of me as a child, with my parents, uncles, cousins. Then something caught my eye.



“Grandma—wait a second.”



I pointed to a photo.



“Who are those kids?”



In the picture: a little boy with dirt on his clothes and face. A shy-looking girl beside him—orange hair,her face just slightly blurry.



Grandma laughed.



“Oh, come on. You don’t recognize her?”



I squinted. No recognition at all.



“No, Grandma.”



She smiled. “That’s you and Juliana.”



Me? Juliana?



I felt something twist in my stomach. I didn’t remember her. I got curious and asked:



“Grandma… I really don’t remember. Who was she?”



“What do you mean you don’t remember? She was your best friend when you were little. You two were inseparable—little lovers.”



“Oh, Grandma, don’t start.”



“You remember Emma, right? Or Parry? That silly girl Mandy?”



“Okay, okay. Enough. I’m going to bed. Goodnight, Grandma.”



“Oh, don’t run off, Taylor! We haven’t even gotten to the other girls!”



I went up to my room and fell asleep.



That night, I dreamed again.



Same walk. Same girl. Same graveyard.



But this time… her face wasn’t clear again.



And the gravestones?



They had names on them: Mandy. Emma. Parry. Three more I didn’t recognize. All names I’d known from childhood… people I’d loved or been close to.



Juliana’s name was missing.



The dream ended, like before. I woke up. I was in shock. What I’d seen scared me. I stayed in bed for almost an hour, staring at the ceiling.



Eventually, I got up. Took a shower. Went downstairs.



Grandma wasn’t in the house.



Panic twisted through me. I ran outside, calling for her.



A voice came from the garden. She was tending flowers.



Relieved, I went back inside. While she was in the garden, I pulled out the photo album and flipped to that same picture.



The girl’s face was clear now.



I stared, frozen. My hands trembled.



She felt familiar in a way that made no sense.



Then the door creaked.



It was Grandma, carrying a few tomatoes and vegetables. She saw me and smiled.



“Oh, you’re looking at the photos?”



“Yeah… Grandma, can you come here a second?”



She walked over.



“Sure, what is it?”



“Wasn’t this girl’s face unclear yesterday?”



She looked at the photo, then at me.



“Yeah… it still is.”



“Still? What do you mean?”



I took the photo again. When I looked—her face was blurry. Just like before.



I dropped the picture and ran upstairs. Grandma called after me.



I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. My mind racing.



What was that? I swear I saw her face.



What’s happening to me?



Who is that girl?



Why can’t I remember?



Is she the girl from my dreams?



I don’t know what to do.



I stayed in my room for hours until Grandma came and got me out. I went downstairs, and we sat down. She began to speak.



"Listen son, I know you’re embarrassed about your childhood girlfriends, but it’s okay."



Hearing that—Grandma still doesn’t realize anything—I got mad. I got up, walked toward the door, and said to my grandma,



"I’m going for a walk. I need some air."



I got out of the house and walked a little, but I didn’t know where to go. I was already scared out of my mind. I walked toward the park. In front of it were a couple of teens hanging out. I walked near them and said,



"Hi kids, can I join?"



"Sure man, come sit," one of them said. Three of them were sitting, all looking normal. One was eating chips and the other two were drinking some beverage. As I sat down, one asked,



"You’re not from here, are you?"



"Actually no, my grandma lives here, just at the end of the street."



"Oh, are you Ms. Susan’s grandson?"



"Yeah, do you know my grandma?"



"Not much, but we know people in this village. You’re Taylor, right? My sister used to talk about you."



"Your sister—who is she?"



"Juliana," he said. As I heard it, I stared blankly at his face. His hair was orange. Was he the brother of that girl I don’t remember? I was scared and reluctantly asked him, afraid of what he might say.



"Which Juliana? The one with orange hair?"



"Yeah, there isn’t any Juliana in this village besides my sister."



"She’s in the village right now?"



"Yeah, she’s at home. Why are you asking?"



"Nothing, just asking. Anyway, I need to go. Have a good night."



"Yeah, you too, man."



I immediately got up and walked back home. As soon as I arrived, I wanted to ask Grandma about it, but she was already asleep. 

I didn’t want to wake her up, so I went upstairs and headed to bed, scared to sleep. It took me hours to fall asleep. I kept turning and turning in bed. When I woke up, I felt relieved.



That’s all I remember. It’s been a week since I returned from my trip to the village—at least, that’s what my friends say. I’m too scared to return there, or even talk with my grandma. 

I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what is real or not. Did I dream those things? Did they happen? Am I going crazy? Am I experiencing something otherworldly? I don’t know.



But every night, I dream of her. Of that place. Of the grave I never found.



I don’t know what’s real anymore.



Only that she’s still there. Waiting.



And that I’ll see her again tonight.
