I took a swig from the plastic cup in my hand. As usual, the metallic taste in my mouth from the water cooler here warranted a call to the EPA, but as usual, I ignored it. My name is Jack, and after what can only be described as the longest and most excruciating day at work, I’m tired. I’m writing on here because I need to get the word out: Do NOT work… no… do not even go NEAR Sampson and Co.’s Paper Company. Let me explain what happened starting last week on Tuesday.

I ignored it… the water, I mean. As I mentioned before, it tasted like ass, pennies. After downing the rest, I crinkled the cup and tossed it into the trash as a hand rested on my shoulder, making me jump. “Jack, ma boy. Didn’t mean to scare ya like that.” The man who stood now in front of me was my overbearing extrovert coworker, Steve.

I never said this to his face, but fuck was he annoying. Anytime I EVER felt like I had a moment to myself, there’s Steve, making some hammed up attempt at making me like him… and trust him, despite knowing him since my first day. I never could shake the feeling he was fake and that I didn’t like him.

“Jesus! Uh, no, Steven. You’re alright.” No, he wasn’t. He was exhausting. “I was just in my head a little.” I gestured to the water cooler. It was directly behind my cubicle against the wall. Shitty access.

“I could see that. Took ya forever to drink that cup. Y’miss the sea, Aquaman?” He laughed. God, that insufferable laugh. So forced, so fake, so donkey-like. Why couldn’t he just get the hint? I could drink 50 cups of this metallic Lethe of Hades than spend another moment with this man.

I laughed weakly in response. “Yeah… sure do, Steve.” I looked at the clock on the office wall: 16:59 or 4:59 pm for those who are lazy. One minute… only one minute till I could go home and get in my comfy bed and listen to my favorite Creepy podCast. Full of stories and jokes that make me enjoy my solitude. One minute of Steven, could I survive that?

“Eager to go home, eh? Wife missin' ya?” The way he talked, I’ll never get used to. His accent and cadence were completely alien to me, unrecognisable, and were probably the source of my discomfort. Besides the fact that no one is THAT nice, of course. The best way I can describe it is if you took English but made every vowel feel short and stressed, like he wanted to finish each word quickly. Kind of like a mix of a Boston and New Jersey accent. He spoke like someone who learned to speak by watching others, not like a baby does, though. Maybe Steve was South African and I was just a bigot… Then again, his name was Steve.

“No, frankly, I’m alone.” One minute of Steve.

“That’s too bad. Anyway, the boss just wanted me to ask ya if yer fine with takin’ the Sunday night shift this weekend. Ya up for it?” He looked at me in anticipation. I didn’t want to do it. I wanted to go home. I like my weekends. You could call me lazy or an introvert. I do not care. But I needed the money.

“Yeah, sure. I can do it.” I’ve never done a night shift before. Why would a paper company even need a night shift? I had worked there for maybe 2, 3 months. I don’t remember. Heck, I don’t even remember applying for the position. That’s what struck me at that moment. I didn’t even recoil at Steve patting me on the back at my response… Why couldn’t I remember? Everyone remembers when they start their new job. Was I that lazy and eager to leave? Steve snapped me out of it.

“Great, ma friend! I’ll let John know. See ya tomorrow!” He said with a wave as he walked into my boss’s office. My other co-workers got up and packed their things the moment the clock struck 5 pm. They all took their time as if they didn’t have better things to go home to. Suckers.

I was the first out the door, and 3 seconds out, I stopped and remembered that I had forgotten my backpack. I definitely was eager to leave, like my body knew something I didn’t. Turning around and making my way to the door, I realized no one followed me out the door. Weird. I made my way through the lobby to the elevator. No one, not a single co-worker. Did they stay behind to make fun of me, or was I just being too insecure? I took the elevator up, and when the floor to my company's office came, the doors opened. And to my surprise, no one was there.

“What the hell?” I didn’t like this, like you’d think I would. I hate people, but… this just didn’t make any logical sense. Was there a backdoor? Did Steve own a helicopter and fly everyone home? I sighed as I saw my backpack on my cubicle chair. I grabbed it and went to leave, but I needed a drink. I’ve been getting thirsty lately, and this place didn’t have any vending machines, and I really didn’t want to lick my lips the whole drive home. So I grabbed a plastic cup, filled it with liquid coins, and took a quick chug to wet my whistle.

As I quickly tossed the cup into the little trashbin next to it, I felt frozen. Not like the temperature, but like I didn’t want to move. I swear I was being watched. Me being alone in here wouldn’t be out of the ordinary, but the buzzing of the fluorescent light, accompanied by the drab grey walls and flooring REALLY set off alarm bells. I quickly grabbed my shit and left.

Sitting in my home, my phone rang. Another spam call. Lately, I’ve been getting pranks from people pretending to be family members, crying and stuff, the whole 9 yards. Never been punked before, and I wouldn’t be punked then. Blocked. Again.

The next day came around… it was 8:50 am and I had walked out of the elevator into Sampson’s. I put my things on my desk and went to the break room to wait for the day to start. As I walked into the room, I could see Steve talking to one of my female co-workers with that shit-eating smile of his. Ugh. Before I could turn around and leave, he called out to me.

“Jack! Hey, ma boy!” My coworker walked away from him and passed me to go to her cubicle. Before I could even swing my head around to Steve’s direction, he already had his hands on my shoulder and was forcing me to walk with him as we talked. It always had to be how Steve liked it, from the conversation to even where you spoke. We stopped before the water cooler where we spoke yesterday before continuing.

“I’m so glad ya took the night shift this Sunday. It’s no picnic!”

“Yeah, it's all good. What’s so different about the night shift?” He looked at me for a moment, thinking.

“Same stuff ya do here with a few extra activities.” He looked at me like he wanted me to do something.

“Thank you?” I said to him. Hopefully that was what he wanted.

“Alrighty then.” He said with a small twinge of disappointment. I guess it wasn’t. As he walked away, work was about to start, and I grabbed a plastic cup but then changed my mind and put it back, getting the workday started.

A few hours later, around noon, I felt sick. Like violently sick. I was sweating. My body felt sore, and my nose was watery. I felt cold, but every time I tried to solve it, I would just get hot, and the cycle would go back and forth. I was about to heave, so I got up and made a break for the bathroom. The door swung open as I threw up everything I had in me into the toilet. I felt a little better until I opened my eyes to what was in it. This thick, black liquid lay at the bottom of the bowl. If there was more to upchuck, I would. The taste of metal coated the inside of my mouth, like I just shoved a bowl of quarters and nickels in my mouth and sucked on them for a while. I flushed the toilet and started to wash my hands and mouth, only… no water came out of the sink. Of course. As I stood there, ready to yell profanities, my co-worker, Kayla,  who worked across in front of me, walked by the door. 

“Are you okay?” She asked. Kayla was a sweet girl, 27, and loved animals. Whenever I was down, she’d find some new way to make me feel better about myself. Lucky man, her husband was. She was a good work-friend. I coughed, getting the words out. “Not really. Sink isn’t working.” I gestured at the sink. She ran off and came back with a bottle of water she must’ve brought, and poured it over my hands for me to clean off. 

“Thanks, Kayla.” She gave me the bottle so that I could wash my mouth out and snickered when she saw the translucent black liquid I would spit out. “Licorice?” she said as I looked at her with a defeated, weak smile.

“I wish.” I lightly chuckled, then checked my mouth to see if there was anything else to wash out. She smiled warmly, and we walked out. What was in my vomit? I hadn’t eaten anything that color, and last time I checked, I didn’t have a stomach ulcer. So either I unknowingly ate a licorice that day, or I had internal bleeding.

She left the bathroom as I finished up, but when I came out, everyone was looking at me. Besides her, she was head down into her work. Unblinking stares punctured the introversion of my chitinous comfort shell. No face of worry or concern. Just blank attention. As quickly as it began, it ended. All heads snapped back to their original places of working. I sat down as quickly as I could as Kayla shot me a confused glance in my direction. Best she not think me insane.

Two hours passed, and the day was nearing its end. I wasn’t as thirsty as I was with the bottle of water Kayla gave me, and I felt slightly better. I clacked away at my keys and printed out reports when I heard Kaya say no to herself repeatedly. “You good, K?”

She peeked over at me from the divider that separates our cubicles. “Yeah, I’m good. Just having trouble with this crossword right now.” I sat up in my chair.

“Well, what’s the question?” She handed me the newspaper she was doing it on and tapped at the question.

“A Mexican term for a mine that has failed its job.” I smiled to myself. I know this answer. “Yeah, it’s called a borrasca, although it usually means storm, which I always found odd. Most of the time it’s just the one R, though. Test it.”

She sat back in her chair, humming. I could hear her typing for the spelling and scribbling into her newspaper. “Nice one, Jack. You did it. Thank you.” Before I could respond, Steven the Heathen stood next to me, one elbow over the corner of my cubicle.

“Workin’ hard or hardly workin’?” I looked at him honestly for once. Unamused. He looked at me for a moment, squinting his eyes in thought. “Ya doin’ alright, lad?” 

“I’m fine, I just… I’m a little under the weather.” He looks at Kayla and back at me. “Honest,” I said.

“Ya look like ya need some water, ma boy.” I should, I really should. But then I remember I already have a bottle of water. 

“I’m good, Steve.” I hold the bottle up and give it a little shake. Steve doesn’t look all that happy.

“Oh, Jack. Company policy, ya not allowed to brin’ ya own drinks. Somethin’ about waste management, otherwise we wouldn’t need the cooler.” He chuckled. The cooler. The only drinkable source of water. Tastes like metal and would probably give me whatever poisoning. I didn’t know how much the water company that supplied us was paying for a policy like that to be a thing and nor did I care. I nodded.

He walked away, and I could see Kayla mouthing a thank you for not snitching on her about the water. I smiled.

Later that evening, 5 pm rolled around, and it was time to head off. Everyone was getting ready to leave like clockwork. John, my boss, came out this time and stood in front of his office, and as if like magic, everyone besides me and Kayla came to a halt, and he had their attention like a general.

“Good job, everyone. You’ve done very well here. Jack, our fine worker over here, is doing the Sunday night shift. Round of applause.” He began to clap as everyone looked to me with smiles and rapt attention. I hated it. Kayla clapped too, but a little more awkwardly, not seeing the big deal. John held his suspenders out like one of those southern lawyers on TV. Besides his southern accent, he always gave that vibe.

“Whelp! Time for ya’ll to get goin’.” He said with a smile of pride for his worker ants, and we continued packing up. Kayla was first out the door this time, and she had said bye to me and gone into the elevator, going down to the ground floor. As I waited for the elevator to make its way back up. I noticed something. Silence. Only the hum of office lights.

Where were my other coworkers? Where was… for Pete’s sake, where was Steve? Again with the helicopter? I swore that if there was a secret executive elevator. I made my way into the offices, and again, they were empty. How was this possible? No personal belongings. Besides Kayla, I didn’t think ANYONE ever brought something personal of theirs to work. All the cubicles were identical except for work stationery. Minus me, Kayla, and well. As I turned around, I was met by the face of my new coworker, Tom, and yelped in fear. He did too.

“Gah! What the hell is wrong with you, Jack?!” He looked at me like he didn’t just Scooby Doo me, and made me jump out of my skin. Why was everyone startling me lately? It’s like everyone had their job quota on scaring me. Tom was a younger man, roughly around 19-20. His voice reminded me of that Simpsons teenager with the pimples all over his face.

“Right back at you. Where is everyone?” He looked around nervously and came close to me, and said: “I don't know. I never see them leave. It’s so strange.... and they’re creepy. Sometimes they just stare at you and smile.” He looked behind me like he was checking if anyone was watching.

“This place is not right, man. This is my first night shift, and they haven’t even told me what to do.” He started to sound scared and erratic. I nodded, thinking maybe he might be a little crazy given how often I’ve seen this man shake in the whole two weeks he’s been here. I hoisted my backpack onto my back and began leaving before he grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me close and whispered: “Don’t. Drink. The water.” I stared at him in confusion as he let go of me, nodding to me in a way of apologizing before walking deeper into the office. I left and went home.

The drive was hazy. I couldn’t stop thinking about what Tom said. “Don’t. Drink. The water.” Why? Why was I not allowed to drink the water? I mean, it was there, for us. Had I never touched that water cooler, I would’ve left that job sooner. I got home, pulled into my driveway, and went inside my house. I did my evening routine that night: shower, teeth, pajamas, podcast, dinner. I checked to see if they released anything new, and it seemed I caught up on the few weeks I had missed.

I decided to get started on dinner, but before I could even get to the kitchen, that familiar black tar tore its way out of my throat and through my teeth. I coughed on what I could only imagine as semi-digested bubblegum, or the piece of bacon that goes down your throat and gets a little stuck before you swallow. Every thought on it made the hurling worse and worse. I scrambled to my feet and rushed to the bathroom. By the time I was done, I had been in there for what felt like hours. I was dehydrated, shaking, and sweating. I cleaned up the mess and had another shower. I had a bag of chips that night. I wasn’t hungry.

The morning was as bad as the evening was. I ended up spending an hour in the bathroom, doing my best to keep myself hydrated while also preventing any more unnecessary mess. I ended up being an hour late. I got into the office elevator and pressed the 6th floor that it was on and waited and waited… and waited. The elevator was taking an unusual amount of time to get to the 6th floor, but it felt no different in speed than previous rides up and down. It took what was 5 minutes to get to my office floor; finally, the doors opened.

I rushed into the office and put my stuff in the cubicle, and gave Kayla a ‘I hope they’re not mad’ look. As I went to sit down, my boss, John, placed his hand on my shoulder. I stopped myself from sitting and turned around. “I’m so sorry, sir. I was having trouble this morning.” He smiled and took a step back, gesturing for me to stand next to him.

“Son, I’m aware that you’ve been feeling under the weather lately.” That was putting it lightly. “We’re a family here, Jack. If you need anything, and we mean anything. Just ask us.” I was touched. I’ve heard about companies and workplaces saying bs like ‘We’re a family’ or ‘Welcome to the COMPANY NAME family!’ but I could tell John meant it.

“Thank you, sir,” I said as he walked away. I went to grab a plastic cup from the water cooler’s cup holder before I remembered Tom’s words of warning from last night: “Don’t drink the water.” I stopped myself. What was the harm in heeding his words? After all, I could never enjoy a cup of this gunk as it tastes as if I ate something like a bug. A robot bug. Next time I’ll just bring a bottle of water or some soda.

The comfort I felt from John dissipated immediately.

Eyes and smiles. Eyes and smiles throughout. All coworkers, again, minus Kayla, were staring and smiling. Anticipating… something. I watched in discomfort as they almost appeared to crane their neck in jittery motions, like a female mantis ready to eat their mate. Some of them looked at my hand, where I held the plastic cup. I raised it and watched their eyes follow. I put the cup in the trash bin as their smiles faded into blank expressions, teeth no longer bare and happy.

As if in unison, they all snapped their heads back into their work. I swear… I’ve never seen them blink. Rubbing my eyes and thinking it might have been my imagination, I went into the break room to try to pour myself a cup of water from the sink, but nothing came out. Was the plumbing okay? A splitting headache overcame me, almost throwing me onto my knees. It was after I had adjusted myself, a memory came to mind. It was the day before my employment… or was it my first day also? The true memories still escape me. I don’t think I’ll ever get those back.

I had found an ad to work at Sampson & Co.’s Paper Company. A dying genre of work, but the ad said the hourly rate was good. $28 an hour. I watched shows that had places like this be full of pranks and coworker whimsy. How I wish it were really like that. I would even take the monotony of an ACTUAL office job at a real paper company. I recalled not only answering the ad but getting hired on the same day. Looking back, that should’ve been a red flag. Everything was.

Thirsty and disappointed, I walked back to my desk and got stuck into work. I typed on my keyboard, wrote out reports, and printed them, stacking them neatly next to me. Hours passed, and I was beginning to feel thirsty, but I pushed through it. The clock hit my break time. For some reason, I was sweating again, and I sat back to marvel at my backbreaking work. 

I opened up one of my folders I put together, and my eyes grew wide. The typing was jargon, completely unintelligible, words swapped around, and letters not where they should be. Like when you lose your temper and smack your keyboard in frustration. John came by and grabbed the folder out of my hands. “Oh, lovely, today’s report already.” He began to take a read through it and nodded. “Good job, son. Thanks again for taking the Sunday night shift by the by, much obliged,” he said, with a fatherly warm smile upon him.

I looked at him with confusion. My work was practically non-existent. “You’re welcome, sir. I don’t know if I’ll do as good of a job as Tom, though.” he looked at me with a smile, tilting his head and asked:

“Who’s Tom?”

I sat there with a pit in my stomach. What did he mean by “Who’s Tom?” Tom! Coworker Tom. The same Tom who wouldn’t shut up about his girlfriend Kerry whenever we spoke, for crying out loud. I breathed. Maybe I had his name wrong this whole time, and I’m an asshole. Tom or… whoever it was that spoke to me was genuinely spooked by this place, and I was starting to see why. I didn’t know if what I saw earlier by the water cooler was real, but I was sure as hell not touching it again. It was probably laced with some sort of silver or mercury, and it was making me see things.

Maybe they didn’t know. I looked at Kayla, tongue in cheek, as she did another crossword. “Psst. Kayla.” She looked up at me and put her newspaper down, and whispered back. “What?” I got as close to the gap between our cubicles as possible.

“Have you ever had a cup of water from the cooler?” She looked as if I had asked an odd question, which, in fairness to her, I had.

“Yeah, why? Don’t trust the stuff?  Not like there's dead flies or rats in it.” I looked behind me and gazed at the translucent tank of water that sat atop the dispenser, clean and clear as well… water.

“Right. Understood.” I sat back in my chair and looked to my left as Steve walked in carrying a large container of files.

“Jack! Come ‘ere, ma friend! Give us a hand!” I got up and helped Steve (for the first and last time in my life) with the box. “Alright, lad. Gotta job for ya.” As he spoke to me, my face went white. His face. It was… wrong. I could see each and every pore in his face; they had the diameter of the black spots on a die, and I SWEAR something was wriggling in them. His brown, suave hair was greasy and wispy at its roots, like they had been plucked from something else and transplanted half-hazardously into his scalp. And his teeth, my god, his teeth.

Rotten and yellow, I tried not to stare, but they were cracked, and I thought I could make out a sharper set behind them like a shark. Hiding away behind them. Eyes pierced into mine like a predator, his cornea growing and shrinking from his yellow iris, the corneas glazed over like a blind or dead man. His head sat on his neck like a rubber mask, a seam line that twisted and morphed around his neck as if his body was actively continuing a connection between his torso and his head.

The worst part… was his voice. A cacophony of audio queues, human speech with the undertones of a dying animal on the side of the road; forced, labored breath, an answer to why his cadence always cut short. Clicking noises after every syllable and… a deer, deer sounds. All sounds that came out, all that were mentioned, all stolen.

I also could hear… Tom’s voice. 

“Are ya ok, Jack?”.I snapped out of it. He was fine. He looked normal. Was it the water that was making me see? Or was it the lack of it that was helping me see?

“I’m s-sorry, Steve. Been a rough few days.” He chuckled.

“That’s alright, lad. Drink some water and you’ll be fine. To rehash, I need ya to take this box to the file sortin’ room and put everythin’ where it needs to go. Thank you kindly.” Before I could ask any questions, he walked off and went into Mr. John’s office and locking the door behind him. If I wasn’t hallucinating, spoiler alert, I wasn’t; what was he? What kinda god could create something like that? Was he a monster? Alien? Demon? Maybe he just looked that way and was the nice and friendly man he’s been since day one. 

I picked up the box and carried it into the hallway. There was Steve’s office (He had his own, executive stuff), the bathrooms, the Sorting Room, the Delivery Room, and finally the Mail Room. The Sorting Room is where I needed to go, but the Mail Room is what caught my eye. It had a big padlock on the door. Why the hell they needed to lock up the Mail Room is beyond me, but not the weirdest thing I’ve seen today. I walked into the Sorting Room and placed the box of files down on the dusty bench. This whole place was dusty. It was mainly tidy and not much lying around, but dust covered everything.

I started to sort the files into their respective shelves when I accidentally knocked something off. A picture frame that was sitting above one of the files horizontally had fallen to the ground when I lifted some of the files. I picked it up. My Lord, why did I pick it up? Sure, it ended up helping, but… maybe if I had just left it there, or put it back on the shelf without looking, MAYBE Kayla would’ve still been alive. 

What I saw in the picture didn’t faze me at first. It was the least dusty thing in this place, so not much effort was needed to wipe the dust off. Then I saw it. A photo of the office, everyone standing before the camera, smiling that creepy ass smile and wide eyes, even John. Then I saw myself, no wide eyes or anything, just a weak smile. I remembered that moment; it was my first day.

Two months ago. There was me, and next to me was… Michael. Upon the realisation of that name, another splitting headache occurred. More memories that were stolen from me by disguised black fluid flooded in. Precious memories. Mine. Michael was my brother. At that point, I almost sobbed because how on earth could I forget? He applied with me and… I felt a pit in my stomach. Kayla sat where Michael once did...
