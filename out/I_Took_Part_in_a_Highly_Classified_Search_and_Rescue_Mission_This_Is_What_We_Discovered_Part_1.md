I’ll start now by saying that what I’m about to tell you won’t be found in any historical document, no after action report, and no military ledger. The details of the account I am about to detail are beyond classified, and as far as I can tell, fully removed from any surviving documentation. All parties associated with the event I am about to document have been sworn to secrecy under threat of treason and conspiracy. For these reasons, and for the sake of all those involved in my tale, I will be utilizing altered names and call signs in my recollection. 

To those who will most certainly try to prosecute me, understand that I originally intended to honor my vow to never speak of this event, and would have gladly taken it to the grave if I could. But you as well as I are well aware of the circumstances that have befallen us. This is no longer a simple matter of classified information, and my conscience would not be clear if I did not warn the public of what is out there. 

I must withhold my name for reasons previously listed, but for the sake of ease, I will refer to myself as “Oculus” for the remainder of this telling. 

On the evening of August 15, 2017, an unidentified radio signal was discovered in the depths of space by American scientists in Ohio. This signal lasted for approximately 31 seconds, then went silent. Normally, this would have been cause for excitement, frontline news, interviews, you name it. From what I can tell by my contact, who I will not name for the sake of anonymity, was practically foaming at the mouth to investigate further. That changed when they played the signal for their direct superior, a scientist I’ll refer to as “Jeremiah”.  

From what my contact told me, Jeremiah was initially just as excited as the rest of the team when he heard the news about the radio waves. Once my contact had actually played it for him, all excitement vanished. 

From what they told me, he went from absolutely ecstatic to what they could only describe as utterly confused as soon as it began. About ten seconds in, he looked absolutely petrified. They couldn’t even recall seeing him move for the rest of the playback, and probably not for a good minute after. When they tried asking him what was wrong, he just turned to them and said in the most monotone and serious tone; 

“(Redacted), you are not to tell any one about what we have heard today. Am I clear?” 

Approximately 48 hours after the initial discovery, a small research outpost was established in Death Valley, California, some 113 miles from the nearest population center. Said outpost was stated to be established specifically for the purposes of investigating the radio signal found in Ohio, and was lead by Jeremiah with a team of his most trusted coworkers. Exactly what that investigation was meant to uncover was never made expressly stated to me or any other operators on the ground, but what we were told was that while it was not officially sanctioned by the United States military, it had received a “generous” research incentive to share any information discovered with them. Each morning, the scientists would report to an off site military official on what they had uncovered, with routine check ins happening every six hours in addition to that. 

By this point, myself and my team still weren’t actually involved in this event. The outpost was staffed almost entirely by civilian scientists, and security was handled mostly by an outside company. The military’s entire involvement was limited to the exchange of information, and I’m pretty sure there wasn’t even a representative on site. That all changed on the morning of September 2, 2017. 

That day saw a complete communications blackout with the outpost. There was no contact made with any member of the staff, the security detail, there wasn’t even static, just complete and utter silence. When the follow up check in also produced nothing six hours later, the call was made to insert a squad of specialists into the outpost, determine what was causing the blackout, and if possible, secure any of the researchers on site. That was where myself and my team came in. 

The evening of September 3, 2017 was a slow one. I was stationed at a military base in or near the Mojave desert. At the time I was completely unaware of the goings on happening some 200 miles away from me, and was more focused on daily routines such as checking equipment, trying not to die of self imposed sleep deprivation, and finding time somewhere in the day for relaxation. On that day, said relaxation took the form of watching an on base buddy of mine, who we’ll call “Lucky”, play some Tom Clancy game about fighting a drug cartel. 

“What did Tom Clancy have to do with this game exactly?” I remember asking as I watched him throw some gangster over a coastline and into the water. Lucky shrugged without taking his eyes away from the screen. 

“I don’t think he had anything to do with it, Tom Clancy died like five years ago I think.” He replied with his signature ten tons of gravel. 

“It was four years ago.” I corrected. I could hear Lucky sigh as he knifed some other cartel member. 

“Whatever, dude. Point is, he had nothing to do with the game.” 

“So what? They just keep making stuff with his name on it for clout?” 

“Probably own the rights to his name or something.” I felt myself recoil a bit at the idea of my name being used for something I had no knowledge of. 

“Is that legal?” I asked. 

“I don’t know man, does it matter?”

“Just kinda feels like a Weekend at Bernie’s situation you know? Like, unethical.” Lucky shrugged again. 

“Maybe, I’m just here to play the game, man.” I was about to say something else before a new, somewhat sterner voice interrupted us. 

“You’re here to serve, soldier.” Both Lucky and I turned to see our lieutenant, a bulkier looking guy with bright red hair that we had taken to calling “Sticky” due to how much of a stickler for the rules he was. We didn’t dislike him, he was just annoying to deal with sometimes. Nevertheless, we both stood up and saluted, which he quickly returned before allowing us to fall back at ease. 

“You boys should probably try to nod off early, we got a big day ahead of us.” He informed us. 

“Someone stopping by for an inspection?” I asked. To my surprise, Sticky shook his head. 

“Got an op debrief at 0500. Make sure to bring your gear and rig, we’re going in immediately after based on what I’ve been told.” 

“Any detail on what kind of op?” Lucky asked as he reached to grab his controller and turn off his game. Sticky replied with a single shake of the head. 

“Not a one. Supposedly the captain will inform of us everything once we’re actually at debrief. Until then, both of you get some shut eye, I need you both bright and rested in there.” Before either of us could reply, Sticky was out the door and making his way off to somewhere else. 

I know the cliche is to immediately feel that something was off, to have some sort of sixth sense that whatever was about to happen was going to go horribly wrong. I didn’t have that feeling. It was sudden, sure, but in our line of work you were ready for sudden, ready for unexpected. Or at least I thought we were. 

Before I knew it, it was 0500 hours on the morning of September 4, 2017. As expected, I had made sure to prepare my full rig and inspect my equipment beforehand, making sure it was all in working order. Despite my punctuality and Lucky’s setting of multiple alarms, we were actually the last two to arrive. Inside a small room barely large enough to hold any of them between the several rows of steel chairs and the projector in between said rows of chairs was a total of ten men. Without saying a word, I moved to take my seat as Lucky took a spot next to me. 

My team, which I’ll refer to as “Hermes”, was made up of our team leader, a warrant officer in the form of Sticky, and four sergeants. Those sergeants consisted of “Avalon”, our operations sergeant, “Borat”, our medical sergeant, myself, a weapons sergeant, and Lucky, who served as our communication sergeant. I had worked with Avalon and Borat before, and was more or less happy to be doing so again. I only hoped Borat’s accent had become a bit more understandable. 

The other five men were likewise separated into a five man fireteam, and was composed similarly of one warrant officer and four more sergeants. This secondary team, which I’ll refer to as “Midas”, had two engineer sergeants we’ll call “Nutty” and “Fruity”, another communications sergeant “Bucky”, and the assistant operations sergeant “Black Eye”. I’d seen these guys around on base before, but hadn’t actually worked with the guys prior to this morning. 

The last man was a near six and a half foot tall monster of a guy who looked like he could rip apart any of the metal chairs in the room with his bare hands. While he was in full rig and gear like the rest of us, he had forgone his helmet for the time being, revealing his short buzz cut and handlebar looking mustache. I recognized the man as one of the captains on base, a man I’ll refer to as “Big Eye”. 

Big Eye was standing beside the screen projection in full combat uniform, and allowed his M4 carbine to lean on the wall beside him. For the sake of not repeating myself, I’ll skip over the introduction and basic debrief he gave us, seeing as how I’ve already listed most of what he said already. 

After explaining our role in the operation, Big Eye moved the slide of the presentation over to a still slide of an audio clip with the pause symbol plastered over the center of it. 

“The only information we have on what the scientists at the outpost were looking into is this sound.” He explained before playing the clip. 

I’m not sure how best to describe the 31 second clip in a way that makes sense. There was a metallic ringing that lasted for the entire duration of the sound clip, which was completely isolated for the first ten seconds of audio. After those ten seconds, there was a periodic sound that resembled a knocking noise if it were combined with the clicking of an insect and the sound radios make when searching for frequencies. The entire thing was enough to make my stomach form knots, it almost sounded like this frequency, whatever it was, was searching for something. In the last five seconds of the clip, a final sound I can only compare to the sound sonar makes on old subs played until the audio clip cut off.  

The room was silent for a moment as everyone inside took in what they had just heard. Most of them, including Sticky, seemed mostly undisturbed by the clip, even turning to each other for possible explanations only to be met with shrugs. Beside me, Lucky seemed more amused than anything, and barely stifled a laugh. 

“All due respect Captain, the heck was that supposed to be?” He asked. Big Eye turned to address him as he reached up and took hold of the upper straps of his rig. 

“That was the signal picked up by satellite radios in Ohio, and what instigated the investigation outpost to which we have been assigned to deploy.” It wasn’t much of an answer, and some of the other guys must have thought so too, because I saw Borat look uncertainly towards Sticky before speaking up himself. I was disappointed to find that his accent seemed to have somehow gotten thicker. 

“Captain, this doesn’t sound like an operation for special ops. Shouldn’t this be the domain of standard forces, maybe even local?” He asked. 

“Perhaps it would have been sergeant, if this outpost wasn’t listed as a black site. No one but the researchers, upper brass, and now the men in this room are even aware of its existence.” Big Eye explained before moving the presentation over to the next slide. 

“These images were captured from an AH-6 as a part of ISR in the hours following the outposts’ radio silence. No personnel have been found entering, leaving, or residing within the compound.” He explained as he moved through the various slides. Each one presented a new image of the lifeless desert, and without a single person in sight. 

There were maybe twenty pictures in total, all taken from the air. I noticed that not a single picture had any view of an established road, and aside from what looked to be a make shift landing site for helicopters, there didn’t seem to be any major constructions that would allow any vehicle to approach the compound. The compound itself was surrounded seemingly on all sides by walls of sand some several times taller than any of the tents inside, making hiking there by foot equally treacherous. It was like the entire construction had been tucked away in a secret corner of the world. Nothing and no one should have been able to reach them, so what in the world had caused them to go silent? 

Upon the slide moving to one final overhead camera shot of the entire outpost and its surrounding fortress of sand, Big Eye began to point at various points within. 

“Due to the nature of this site, there are no floor plans to speak of, and we will be going in mostly blind. Helicopters will drop each team off a little under one mile at either side of the compound, at which point both teams will move in on foot. Hermes and Midas are to clear each side of the compound, remaining in contact upon entering or clearing each designated area until both teams converge in the center, which both teams with work together to secure.” He explained. 

“Rules of engagement?” Came the deep, no nonsense voice of Avalon. 

“As far as everyone here is concerned, this is still a civilian, non-combat zone. That means you do not have clearance to engage anyone or anything we come across, do not fire unless you are fired upon.”

“If I may ask, sir.” I began, waiting for the captain’s attention to turn to me. Without missing a beat, Big Eye turned to face my direction.

“Does command have any theories on what might have caused this? What are we getting ourselves into?” I asked. For a moment, Big Eye didn’t immediately respond, instead glancing carefully to each man in the room. Each one’s attention became focused on the captain, awaiting his answer. After what felt like a full minute of uncertain silence, Big Eye sighed and moved the presentation to another slide, this one containing another still image of an audio file and a pause sign.  

“We have no complete theories at this moment, but at approximately 2300 hours on the evening of September 1, command received one final radio transmission from the outpost before the blackout began. That transmission included an additional audio file from the lead researcher of the outpost. The sound file is as follows.” 

Without missing a beat, the captain hit play on the file, which for some reason, was the same 31 second clip he’d played for us before. I looked around the room to see if anyone else shared my confusion, and did in fact notice varying levels of bafflement from the other men present. From Sticky squinting his eyes and turning his head slightly toward the projector, to Avalon putting a finger in his ear to clean it out, to Borat looking to each of us hoping for an answer. Even Lucky seemed bemused, as he shook his head and looked almost annoyed. 

The other team likewise shared our confusion, each one showing clear signs of bewilderment. 

“They sent back the signal that started all this? Why?” Asked one of the engineer sergeants, Fruity I think. Big Eye simply shook his head as he prepared the file again. 

“Listen closely.” He instructed. 

Taking a closer listen, I again noticed the same strange metallic ringing for ten seconds, followed by the odd mix of knocking, chirping, and frequency searching  from before. When the clip finished, most all of the men present seemed just as, if not more confused than the first listen. For a moment, I was just as puzzled as they were, before I realized something. 

“Where was that sonar noise?” I asked. Understanding dawned on the faces of those gathered as Big Eye watched all of us. 

“Exactly, Oculus. Experts have determined this sound to be distinct from the one picked up by satellite some weeks ago, and it doesn’t end there.” He began, splitting his attention between every man, his eyes boring into our very being with dead seriousness. 

“According to Jeremiah, the lead researcher on site, it was recorded by an associate of his emanating approximately one mile underneath the Earth’s surface right here in California approximately one year ago. She was a seismologist.” 

The knots in my stomach tightened as I fully processed what Big Eye had told us. I suspect that all of us knew what was being implied by this connection, but no man was brave enough to speak it into existence. As much as I would love to tell you that we all brushed it off, that we all saw it as just some coincidence, I can’t. 

“You each have your assigned teams, and your gear. Dust-off is in one hour. Be ready.” Was the last thing the Captain said before retrieving his weapon and helmet and walking outside. For a time, no one moved, seemingly too disturbed or uncertain to function. I’m not sure how long it was before Lucky and I were the last two men in the debrief. I’m also not sure how long it took for me to actually stand up, retrieve the M249 SAW that I had been assigned, and make my way to the helicopter. 

I wordlessly climbed aboard the bird as sand and dust was kicked up all around us, and the whirling sound of the blades drowned out all others. I told myself it was nonsense. That what the captain, and presumably command was saying was impossible. I can’t say for certain how many justifications I thought up in my head about a reasonable explanation for what we were going into. Domestic terrorists, radio tampering, foreign frequencies we hadn’t discovered, anything. None of them seemed to put me at ease. 

For a time, the silence in the helicopter was absolute. Sticky, Avalon, and Borat all seemed to share in my concern, my need to justify what we might be walking into. 

“I mean, it’s ridiculous, right?” Said Lucky after some period of time. I looked up at him in a stupor, a half forced smile on his face has he held his M4 carbine and under mounted  launcher under his chest. 

“What?” I half mumbled in response. Lucky forced out a chuckle and shook his head. 

“Come on Oculus, you don’t really think there’s some creature under the Earth playing telephone with some big UFO do you?” He said, half laughing through his admittedly absurd explanation. When he explained it like that, I had to agree that it was a crazy idea. Lucky’s jovial attitude only added to the farcical nature of it, and I allowed myself to laugh along. 

“Yeah, completely ridiculous.” I parroted back. Lucky, sensing his temporary victory, turned to the rest of the team, who seemed to fall out of their stupors as Lucky spoke. 

“Exactly! All of you are getting worked up over coincidence, there’s a million reasons those signals could have matched up. Probably just some homegrown wannabe big shots using codes to communicate, that’s all.” 

“Communications linked to a black site disappearing into thin air?” Asked Borat with a less than convinced tone. Lucky paused for a moment, his face contorting as he tried  to think up of a convincing argument. 

“PMC maybe? Lotta those guys are ex-military, they could probably pull something off like that.” Avalon seemed particularly incensed by that explanation, and turned angrily to glare at Lucky. 

“A PMC? Really? In a government sanctioned investigation? Come on, Lucky, you’re not that dense, are you?” He half asked, half demanded. 

“What? You got a better idea?” Lucky asked defensively. Now it was Avalon’s turn to stagger. 

“Well, no, but come on, what PMC would be dumb enough to attack American soil? It just doesn’t make sense!” 

“What? And underground monsters working with space aliens does?” Lucky shot back. 

“Lock it down, all of you!” Sticky shouted at us, pulling the port cover on his Mossberg back and checking its chamber. 

“I don’t know what it is we’re walking into, and neither do any of you. But whatever it is, we’re gonna bring it down by working together, and finding those missing researchers. Am I clear?” He said glancing at each of us, clearly expecting some level of compliance. 

Borat was the first to respond.

“Yes sir.” He said with a slightly shaking voice. Sticky nodded at the medical sergeant and looked to me, his eyes fierce and convicted. There was a fire in his gaze that seemed to spread as he looked over me, and while my uncertainty didn’t vanish entirely, it did seem to motivate me, if even slightly. 

“Yes sir.” I echoed. Sticky nodded at me then focused his gaze on Avalon, and finally on Lucky. Both replied in the affirmative, although in Avalon’s case it seemed almost begrudging. 

Satisfied to have brought the bickering to an end, Sticky looked between each of us as he spoke again. 

“Good. Now I know this all unusual, believe me, I feel it too. But we are going to get through this. Each of you are some of the best men in this entire force, and we’re gonna prove it once we land, Hooah?” 

“HOOAH.” We all replied. 

Even as I tried to find strength in the lieutenant’s words, however, I couldn’t get the audio clips out of my head. I wondered why they didn’t match exactly despite being so close. Why did one have that weird distorted sonar when the other didn’t? I wasn’t sure I bought Lucky’s theory of an ex-military PMC, but like he said, the alternative was just so bizarre. 

Whatever it was, I knew I wouldn’t have to wait long. Before I knew it, even more time had passed, and out of the side windows I could see the small, familiar shape of our landing zone, tents surrounded by the ring of sand. And my heart began racing. 

It seems this site has a limit on how many characters I can use, so I’ll have to cut off this recollection here. Please know that I am dedicated to getting the rest of this transcript out there, I just need a little more time. 

Please stay safe in the meantime. God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America.
