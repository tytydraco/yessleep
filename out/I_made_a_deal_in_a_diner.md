   Something about a greasy old diner in a small town had a way of bringing me back down to earth. Maybe it was the ambience of the sizzling food in the kitchen combined with the clatter of plates on dilapidated tables. Perhaps it was the scent of warm coffee paired with the kind of burger you could never find anywhere else. Nothing fancy or even that good. Just warm and greasy enough to be comfortable. Maybe it was childhood memories of eating with my family at places not so different from this one. Whatever it was, there I sat, wishing I could sit in this cozy little vestige of Americana forever, or at least until my life got started, cuz it seemed like I couldn’t start it on my own.

   I grew up in a small town like this. I left for college, got a music degree, and found a job in retail. I’ve been trying for a few years to make music my job, specifically as a pianist. I’ve done some session work, toured with a couple local artists, but never found anything that seemed to stick, and for the most part have felt sort of lost ever since graduating. Now I was on my to a neighboring city to see about a job as a music teacher. It wasn’t exactly what I envisioned for myself. Then again what did I think I’d really be doing with a music degree? Featuring on a Taylor Swift top ten hit? Composing the soundtrack for Star Wars XXII? This though, seems like pretty realistic work for me. At least I could put my degree to good use. Still, it felt like I wasted so much time just for a measly teaching gig. I’d give about anything for a shot at something more real.

   I stared out the window while I waited for my food, watching the storm clouds gather over the small town. Before long the rain started to fall. The sound of the downpour matched the sizzling in the kitchen. It was almost enough to make me nod off. I heard the bell of the door ring, followed by footsteps approaching.

   “Scuse me sir,” said an upbeat voice behind me, “Mind if I sit here?”

   I looked up and saw a tall lanky man. It was an odd request considering that there were plenty of seats available, although all the window seats were taken by larger crowds. I figured I’d humor him. “Feel free,” I told him. He sat across from me and picked up a menu. 

   “Whaddya say?” He asked, “The burger, or the chicken fried steak?”

   “I couldn’t tell you. This my first stop here. But I ordered the cheeseburger anyway.”

   “The fried steak then,” he said folding the menu back up. “Oh waitress!” He called.

   “Ready to order hun?” said a voice behind me, only it didn’t belong to the waitress. In fact it was the same voice as that of the man in front of me. I looked up and saw the same tall, lanky man. Only instead of the suit the man in front of me wore, he was in the waitress’s outfit. I looked the man, then at the “waitress”, then back again. The man gave his order and his double left. I stared at the man dumbfounded, gesturing behind me, my mouth not finding the words to speak. So the man spoke for me.

   “I know right?” He smirked, “I really do pull off that skirt.”

   I looked around the whole restaurant. My jaw fell to the floor when I saw that every patron now had the same face as the man in front of me. “Who are you?” I finally asked.

   “My buddies call me Stan.” He extended a hand. “Are we buddies Martin?”

   “How do you-“, I cut myself off, it wasn’t as important as my next question. “Where do you come from?”

   “Down south,” he shrugged, “I’m not too popular in the Bible Belt though, so here I am.” His coffee was brought out and his took a sip of it and smiled. “I’ve been around a bit, but tell me Martin, why does no coffee compare to a diner cup with milk and sugar?”

   “What do you mean down south?” I asked, almost hoping he wouldn’t answer.

   “Oh Martin,” he raised an eyebrow. “Now don’t go and act all coy with me, I think you know.”

   I had an idea or two of what he was implying, but even after seeing all that I had just now, I needed a little more confirmation. Or I would if I wanted to hear this psycho out. Instead I ran to the door, but when I opened it, rather than a rainy street, I saw something that will haunt my dreams and my waking hour for years to come. An endless ashen landscape. A dark haze hung low, so that I couldn’t see the sky, assuming there was one. I heard a terrible sound in the distance. Voices. It sounded like thousands of voices shrieking and weeping simultaneously. I let the glass door close. The window still showed the rainy street side. That was more confirmation than I wanted. 

   “Sir, please don’t leave the restaurant until your check’s been paid,” said waitress Stan.

   I walked back to my table. Stan was slicing into his fried steak. “Yep,” he said, “I say y’all folks up north complain about global warming too much. I mean I’ve lived in heat you would not believe. And I got no a/c.”

   “Well what do you want with me?”

   “Not a lot really. I just thought I might be able to help you out a little.”

   “What with?”

   “What with? What do you think dipshit? You’re on your way to interview for a prestigious position teaching the grateful youth the art of music making all for an incredibly rewarding salary I’m sure. Or maybe you want more out of life.”

   “Of course I want more, and sure I’ve been floundering in my field for years, but I’m sure once I have some stability, I can find something a little more rewarding.”

   “Well I’m sure a driven focused young man such as yourself will have no problem finding that big break. But then again…” He looked at the door as the bell rang again. I watched as someone that wasn’t Stan walked in. He seemed familiar somehow. He was old, probably in his eighties. The way he spoke to the server sounded so close to home. It was me. He, or I, droned on about finally being close to retiring from teaching. 

   I turned back to Stan. “I know what you’re doing, but that doesn’t have to be me.”

   “No of course you’re right it doesn’t. But it is certainly possible. Probable even. Once you get into a bland but comfortable rut, it can be extremely difficult to escape it. It can be difficult to even want to. Do you want to want that life, Martin?”

   “No,” I relented, “I don’t. I really don’t. But that doesn’t mean I’d want to sell myself.”

   Stan laughed, “Martin, Martin, Martin! That’s not what I’m asking for no, no, no!”

   “Then what do you want?”

   “A shard.”

   “What?”

   “Just that. A small shard of a soul. So small you wouldn’t even notice it’s gone.”

   “And what would I get in exchange?”

   “Several years. Several years of success in whatever endeavor you pursue. You want to produce the next big hit? It’s yours. Play your own songs before grand crowds? You can. Still wanna teach? You can at the most prestigious universities, instead of babysitting inattentive brats. Whatever you set your mind to, success will come.”

   “At when the time is up, what then? Back to retail?”

   “Not necessarily. Your fate is entirely in your hands after that. Maybe you’ll be able to maintain your fortune, or achieve even greater heights, who knows Martin?”

   “All that just for a shard of myself?”

   “So minute you’d never miss it.”

   I thought about it. But not for long. After all, maybe I could make it in the limelight. If not, at least I’ll have gotten a taste of it. That’ll be enough for me.

   “Okay,” I said. “I’ll take it.”

   Stan smiled widely. “Well then, there’s only one thing left to do.”

   He grabbed a knife and gestured toward my hand. I opened it to him. I expected a slice at my palm, but he only pricked my index finger. He let a single drop of my blood fall into his hands.

   “Well Martin,” he began as he stood up, “It’s been a pleasure doing business with you.” He moved to the door and said one more thing before he left, “If you’re ever in need of assistance again, I’ll be sure to drop by.”

   He left. The real waitress returned with my order. It was odd, having the most bizarre experience of my life, then biting into a very ordinary burger at a very ordinary diner. Why’d I even choose to eat at a dusty old diner anyway?
