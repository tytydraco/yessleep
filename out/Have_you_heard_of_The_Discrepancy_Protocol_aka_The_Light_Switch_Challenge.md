Hey, guys. Remember a couple of years ago there was a post here talking about the Speculo Challenge? Where you had to spend the night looking into a mirror in the dark and if you made it to morning without losing your mind, you’d achieve great things, the road would open up for you to be a big success or something? It was kinda crazy, but creepy af. (If you try looking for it now, the post’s been taken down, which is pretty weird.  The mods don’t normally do that, right?)

Anyway, the reason I’m writing this is because yesterday I got a very similar thing through the door! Just like the fella who posted about the Speculo challenge did.  Yeah, an unmarked white envelope, except for  ‘DO TRY THIS AT HOME’  written on the front. Inside, just several sheets of unlined white paper covered in a really messy hand-written scrawl in red ink. Again, exactly what the original poster got through their letter box!  It’s obviously from the same person. The writing’s in the same voice (or voices!). Sometimes the tone is friendly, sometimes teasing, sometimes formal like a professor or something, then it might shift to being plain rude, other times it’s absolutely vicious and cruel, and often, no other way to describe it, it’s just really fucking unnerving. One thing the previous poster didn’t mention is the pages smelled bad too, but not in an obviously stinky way, Hard to describe, tbh. It smells wrong, basically. Paper shouldn’t smell like that.

I typed it all up for you. Took ages but I’m out of work now and don’t have much else going on. A couple of words were hard to make out, but I’m sure I got nearly all of them down.

Would be good to hear your thoughts? Is this a prankster? Anyone else had anything similar? There’s no name, so are these being posted randomly? Hate to think I was targeted, ffs.

So, anyway, this one is a different challenge. It has to be complete bullshit, obvs, but you know, I didn’t try the Speculo Challenge and I’m sure as shit not going to try this new one.

Here is the complete text….

*Greetings, friend.*

*How are you hanging? Are you feeling okay? How is your back? Hahaha. Is that itchy feeling on your scalp still there? Go on, scratch it. Feels good. Don’t scratch it too much though. What if you can’t stop scratching? Hahaha.*

*Forgive me, I’m in a good mood today. I’m always happy when we find someone worthy of one of our challenges. Yes, I’m talking about you, friend. We think you may be the right candidate for our very latest challenge, concocted by our bravest  (illegible) and designed to bestow SPECIALness upon those who are sorely lacking in that attribute.*

*…….*

*…….*

*But first, here’s a little spiel, from our sponsors….*

*Do you ever worry that it’s too late, too late to become the person you wanted to be, that you felt in your bones you were destined to be? Let me tell you something. You are right, it is too late. If you had caught the worm early, you would have done it all by now, you would already be everything you needed to be. But what happened? You waited and waited and waited and it even got to the point when you thought to yourself, it’s too late, why even try now, it’s too late. Well, here is the AWFUL truth, my dear friend, all those years you thought it was too late and that there wasn’t enough time, you were wrong, ha, there was time, you had time. But now, right now, it is, in fact, undeniably, irrevocably, too late.*

*It doesn’t matter how old you are. If this letter has found you it means it is too late. For you.*

*……*

*……*

*Or it would be, hahaha, if it were not for… (drum roll please…)*

*“The Discrepancy Protocol aka The Light Switch Challenge”*

*Tell us, Mr. CoolBeans, what is “The Discrepancy Protocol aka The Light Switch Challenge”?*

*Well, I will tell you, as a child did you ever play ‘Spot the Difference.’?*

*The question is rhetorical. You did, so you will know that the traditional game of STD (no sniggering at the back) is a visual puzzle or game where two images that are almost identical are presented side by side. The aim is to find the differences between them. These can be subtle, such as a change in colour, shape, position, or details within the images.*

*Well, friend, this is the same, the same but different.*

*Like the Speculo Challenge, there is nothing complicated about “The Discrepancy Protocol aka The Light Switch Challenge”.*

*Here’s what you have to do…*

*You have to wait until it is pitch dark, late into the night, and then you need to traipse downstairs (unless you live in a bungalow, ha!) and you need to head for the kitchen, but you must not step inside it. You must stand just outside, bravely gazing into its dark interior. And the darkness must be close to total, which means of course that the lights of the room or hallway that you are currently standing in as you peer into the inky darkness of the kitchen, must also be turned off.*

*You are standing in the dark, just outside the kitchen, looking into it.*

*And then you must say the following words. (Don’t worry, if you live with someone, you don’t have to say them loudly, you can whisper them.)*

*“I want to play the Light Switch Challenge or be damned. I want to be enlightened.”*

*And then, please, please don’t be scared, while standing just outside the kitchen, you must reach inside, find the light switch on the wall by the door frame and simply turn the light on.*

*Don’t worry, everything will look normal, just as you remember it. That is the point.*

*Now, look, really look, cast your eyes over the layout of the kitchen and try to commit it to memory. Check out the large appliances, one would expect there to be an oven plus hob, a fridge, of course, almost certainly a microwave, a dishwasher if you’re lazy sods, inevitably some kitchen cupboards and worktops. Then you’ll have the ordinary tools and utensils, your pots and pans, your knife rack and its corresponding cutting board. If not hidden away, you can probably see  some measuring cups, large wooden spoons, a couple of spatulas, an egg whisk.  Do you have a table and chairs?  Good! How many? Do you have pictures on the walls, holiday souvenirs, maybe a fruit bowl. What kinds of fruit? How many of each type? Take it all in, drink it in visually.*

*Take as long as you want. Try and remember it all, or as much as your puny mind can collect.*

*Take as long as you want.*

*When you are ready, reach in again and switch the light off.*

*You are now plunged back into darkness.*

*Count to one hundred, or as high as you can (ha!).*

*Finished? Now, slowly reach in and switch the light back on.*

*Everything inside the kitchen will look exactly the same.*

*But it won’t be**.*

*That is the challenge.* *You must try and figure out what has changed**. It will only be one thing. And it will be subtle.*

*Don’t go into the room! Stay exactly where you are (adhering to the same vantage point will make it easier to spot the difference.) Also, if you go into the kitchen, there is nothing we or God could do to help you.*

*Look. Carefully.*

*Before you might have had a bunch of yellow bananas. Now one of them might have turned green. Maybe you have an old style clock on the wall and the second hand has stopped. But wasn’t it stopped before? You’re not sure. Maybe that’s not it, then.*

*Look hard. What has changed?*

*It behoves me to remind you that your rational mind will try to rebel at this point.*

*Nothing has changed, you will say to yourself. How could it have changed? There was no-one in the kitchen to move anything around. You would have sensed if there was. You would have screamed (ha!).*

*Except you will sense it.  Something has changed.  Your subconscious mind will know.*

*You know it.*

*Look harder.*

*Remember, it’s subtle.*

*Let me give you some examples of correct answers for challenges played previously. That might help you.*

\-  *The digital clock on the oven is showing the wrong time, off by a couple of minutes.*

 *-  The fruit bowl on the kitchen table is missing one grape.*

 *-  There is now a 1 cm gap in the window curtains when before there was none.*

*Does that help?*

*Keep looking.*

*Take all the time you want.*

*Something will have changed.*

*And here’s the deal…*

*If you see it, if you spot the difference, if you can discover what is different from your vantage point (do not step inside!), then all you have do is this.*

*You must whisper the following words…*

*“The difference is…(say the difference)… I can go home now, for I am enlightened”*

*If  the answer is correct, then get ready, friend, because your luck will change.*  

*Soon, sooner than you expect, you will have EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED.*

*EVERYTHING!*

*But what if you get it wrong….*

*Oh, boy….*

*If you get it wrong…*

*You will find that you can no longer do anything but stand where you are and reach in with your hand and switch the kitchen light on and off.*

 *The darkness behind you will become total.*

*There will be nowhere to turn to.  Even the instinct to turn around will be gone as there will be no longer be any sense that there is anything behind you. You will feel that in your bones.*

*And you cannot step inside the kitchen either. You will know that the consequence of doing so, of breaking that cardinal rule, would be …unfavourable.*

*All you can do in your universe now is stay rooted to the spot, reach inside the kitchen and flip the light switch on or off.*  

*And here is the task that lies ahead of you.*

*You must switch the light off and then on again.*

*This will become known as Kitchen View #1. You must ask yourself, is this view of your kitchen the exact view of the original kitchen, down to the last atom?*

*Almost certainly the answer will be no, because the change will no longer be subtle. In all likelihood, You will know straight away that it's not the original view.*

*So what then?* 

*Then you must plough on, friend, switch it off and on again to get Kitchen View #2.*

*Is this the original view of the kitchen?*

*Almost certainly not.*

*So switch it off and on again, stupid.*

*And you will need to continue flipping the light switch on and off, again and again and again and again and again and again TRAPPED IN A NIGHTMARE CYCLE and again and again and again and … until what you see in the kitchen is exactly what you saw there originally and (to give an illustrative example) not even one missing grape from a bunch of these on a fruit bowl on the table .*

*You are in essence playing “The Discrepancy Protocol aka The Light Switch Challenge” in reverse.*

*I would wish you good luck but…*

*Remember the challenge is no longer about knowing what is different, it’s about recognising when it’s back to being exactly as it was at the very start, the proverbial  kitchen view #0.*

*Remember you must continue to flip the light on and off until from your perspective the kitchen is back to precisely how it looked at the very beginning.*

*No matter how long it takes. (FAQ. What about eating and sleeping etc? You will no longer need to do anything as mundane as that, you’ll be glad to hear.)*

*When you are sure (please, please be sure) that  the room has finally returned to its original state, then you must whisper the following words.*

*“I am ready to go home.”*

*At which point you may continue with your life, your pathetic loser life, since you did not succeed at the “The Discrepancy Protocol aka The Light Switch Challenge”, you merely managed to finally extricate yourself from its influence.*

*It goes without saying that you only get one chance to nail it. If you decide to whisper  “I am ready to go home” and the room has not actually reverted back to its original state, if you get it WRONG then the worst thing that can happen to you will happen to you and will continue to happen to you even beyond the heat death of the universe.*

*Now, the powers that be insist that I give a PLETHORA of examples of potential kitchen views, ones that you might come across as you endlessly switch the light off and on again and again and again hoping against hope to revert to the original scene.* 

*The following examples are for illustration only, each person will see something different every time they flip the switch, but these will give you a FEEL (no sniggering at the back) of what awaits.* 

***Potential kitchen view #1.*** *One of the kitchen cabinet doors is askew, but only slightly.*

***Potential kitchen view #3.*** *The garden view outside looks different – it's dark, but you can make out a trampoline when there wasn't one previously. And there is someone jumping on it, but you cannot make out who or what it is.*

***….9.*** *The digital clock on the microwave displays the wrong time*

***27.*** *You see your reflection on a surface that should not reflect.*

***81.*** *A family photo on the opposite wall now has a person missing and another that is so unfeasibly tall that their head is cropped off at the top of the picture*

***243.*** *The room has aged decades, everything in a state of disarray and disrepair, peeling wallpaper yellowed and curling, black mould all over.*

***729.*** *Everything in the same place, but you do not recognise a single colour.*

***2,187.*** *You see the beast under the kitchen table. This is your first view of it. Your mind cannot comprehend what you are seeing but you know that it sees you with its eyes that are not eyes. And you KNOW that you will see it again, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, millennia, infinities from now, and each time it will be closer. You must be on high alert from now on and be ready to turn the light off again really quickly whenever you see the beast as it will be impossible to know how suddenly or how far it can pounce.*

***6,561.*** *The oranges in the fruit basket have been replaced by satsumas.*

***19,683.*** *The room is the same size but all of its contents have been miniaturised to a tenth of their original size.*

***59,049.*** *You see every object, everything in the room in your peripheral vision, no matter where your eyes are pointed at. Don't try imagining what that would look like. You'll fail. But, don't worry, you'll see…*

***177,147.*** *The pattern on the kitchen tiles begins forming symbols that seem to shift and writhe, spelling out words in no earthly language*

***531,441.*** *The fruit bowl contents are crawling with ants*

***1,594,323.*** *The same mug appears in a markedly different position – it was on the table before, now it's on the floor, shattered*

***4,782,969.*** *There is a fly.*

***14,348,907.*** *You see a different kitchen, a bigger, more expensive one belonging to a much larger house. You see family members milling around preparing for a sumptuous meal. You recognise yourself among them, but this is not you-you, this is the you you could have been and this is what you could have had, the success you could have enjoyed, if you had not been, let's face it, your own worst enemy, sabotaging yourself at every juncture. You stay on this view longer than on any other one so far.*

***43,046,721.*** *The room and its contents have enlarged terrifyingly. Everything looms above you. You suddenly wonder if it is you that has been miniaturised. You discard this possibility, because if that was the case, you would not have been able to reach the light switch. You chuckle at this realisation. It sounds like crying.*

***129,140,163.*** *You see nothing. Nothing at all. Not even darkness. Not even darkness. Like a blind man, but not one who has lost his sight, one that was born with no eyes (Imagine seeing out of your elbows. You can't, can you? That's the point, ha!)*

***387,420,489.*** *Every single object in the room is a light switch, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, covering every last inch of floor and wall space. And though it feels that it should be impossible, you are able to reach every single one of them with your hand, all while still standing at the threshold to the kitchen. All but one of the switches do absolutely nothing, and you must work your way through each until you find the one that works.*

***1,162,261,467.*** *The fridge has caught fire*

***3,486,784,401.*** *The switch on the wall has disappeared. Your fingers scrabble at an empty wall. You realise almost immediately that the switch is now behind your left eye and you must therefore scoop the eye out in order to flip the switch. When you are halfway done the switch moves back to its original position and you can flip it and happily move on.*

***10,460,353,203.*** *The salt and pepper shakers have switched colours.*

***31,381,059,609.*** *The beast drags you into the kitchen and mauls your body and devours you completely and you feel every moment of the most exquisite pain imaginable, all while paradoxically still watching all this from the doorway.*

***94,143,178,827.*** *The chairs around the table are occupied by shadow shapes that suggest human forms but with too many limbs, too many angles*

***282,429,536,481.*** *The subtle, humming noise from the fridge is fractionally louder.*

***847,288,609,443.*** *You see infinite versions of yourself in infinite kitchens, all trapped in the same cycle, all visible through recursive reflections in every surface*

***2,541,865,828,329.*** *The light no longer works. You remain in absolute darkness. You continue to flip it mindlessly, on and off, again and again and again and again again again again again again for a few more minutes, hours, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, millenia, infinities….Finally, the light goes on. Hurrah!*

***7,625,597,484,987.*** *The kitchen is revealed as a single cell in a vast organic structure, pulsing fleshy walls showing you're inside something incomprehensibly large and alive*

***22,876,792,454,961.*** *The "challenge" was never a test – it was a summoning, and you were the final component needed to tear open the veil*

***68,630,377,364,883.*** *The kitchen returns to its former state. With one important difference. There is no longer someone at the door, just outside the room, reaching inside to turn on the light*

***205,891,132,094,649.*** *The kettle is now a different shade of light grey.*

*No more examples will be given. You will have to wait and see for yourself, ha!*

*And that is it, more or less.*

*This much is obvious.*

*Only an absolute idiot of the highest magnitude would play “The Discrepancy Protocol aka The Light Switch Challenge”, knowing what they had to lose.*

*Only an absolute fucking idiot, the sort who would read this entire letter, understand every word of warning, comprehend the full magnitude of what could go wrong, and still think to themselves, "Yeah, but it probably won't happen to me."*

*Which is why we have such high hopes for you, friend.*

*------------*

That’s it. WTF, right? Even the way it ends. Who would try the Discrepancy Protocol or Light Switch Challenge or whatthefuck? The whole letter just seems like a long-winded insult to the reader, right?

It’s just some stupid shit.

Yeah, I kind of have to tell you this, though. Wouldn’t be fair if I don’t. Look, it doesn’t mean anything, but two thirds of the way into typing this up at the kitchen table, the lights went out for a few seconds, then came back on. Happened a few times. The lights were already off in the living room, so I don’t even know if it was just in the kitchen or the whole house. It’s happened before when the electric company is doing some work (it was 1:00am, so unlikely) but you know, it happens.

But I swear on my life if you’d put a gun to my head during those few minutes when it was happening, when the lights were going off and on, I still wouldn’t have looked towards the kitchen doorway to see if there was anyone standing there, and if they were reaching inside to turn on the lights. On and off. On and off. Again and again and again and again…

Anyway, that’s it. What do you guys think?

Edit: I just heard the Speculo Challenge story is still up on NoSleep. The post was not taken down after all!  I’ve asked around and it’s true. But here’s the thing. I can’t see it. I’ve tried googling it. It doesn’t even come up for me in any searches. How is it some people can see it and some can't? If I was Mr.CoolBeans, (not sure if that’s his real name, but that’s how he referred to himself once in the letter) I would say that being able to see both posts may actually be SIGNIFICANT.

If you can see both posts then it means you might be SPECIAL.

You may be one of the chosen ones, friend. Ha!
