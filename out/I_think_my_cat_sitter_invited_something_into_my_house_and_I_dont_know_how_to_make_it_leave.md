Me and my friend decided to go abroad on a girls trip, however I was nervous about leaving my cat and none of my family could look after her for me. My friend suggested I find a cat sitter on an app and, after browsing through available sitters in my area, I found a young girl called Emily. She was 17 and doing cat sitting for a bit of money while she was in college. We agreed she would come to feed and play with my older cat Boots twice a day for the three days I was away; she was a sweet young girl and I trusted her implicitly. 

While I was away, Emily sent pictures and videos and updates and asked if it was ok if a couple of her friends came with her to the last visit as they were going to hers after, and I agreed as long as they didn’t go upstairs - I had a pet camera as Emily knew so I could monitor the visits so I knew it would be fine. 

I came back, all was as I had left it, however Boots didn’t quite seem herself. My normally confident, playful cat was now very skittish - staring at dark corners and suddenly darting from the room, hissing at thin air, and scratching at my bedroom door and yowling where she’d normally fall asleep next to me in bed. 

This had been the first time I’d left her for longer than one night so I out the odd behaviour down to seperation anxiety… that was until weird stuff started happening in the house. 

I would hear scratching at the door or walls when I could see Boots was asleep or outside in the garden. Things in the kitchen and living room would be moved when I knew I hadn’t moved them (I live alone) and Boots couldn’t possibly have done it. There would be handprints on my mirror that would show up in the steamed up mirror, I would randomly hear three taps on the walls, the doorbell would ring when no one was outside, and I would wake up at 3.03am every night when I usually was a heavy sleeper right through the night. I would feel as though someone was watching me, hear whispers behind me that would stop when I looked, and even family members who visited would comment on my house having a ‘creepy vibe’, which they’d never mentioned before. 

The final straw came when I woke up at 3.03 as had become normal now, feeling as though someone was touching my face. I assumed it was Boots’ tail as she sometimes slept on my pillow above my head with her tail tickling my face, but this felt different. Bolting up in bed, I looked around for the cause and heard boots yowling and whimpering through my open bedroom door - I could have sworn I shut it but it was now open and when I looked through, I could see a shadow and what looked like Boots levitating, hissing and squirming to get down. I screamed and Boots dropped to her feet as if something had let her go after picking her up. Enough was enough. Mess with me all you want but DO NOT mess with my cat. 

I grabbed Boots, locking her in her carrier, grabbed some stuff and called an Uber to my friends house. Hammering on her door to wake her up, she eventually answered, sleepy and confused. Tearfully, I explained everything to her and she said we could stay. 

In the morning, having slept on the situation, we racked our brains to think what could have changed. Noting that it seemed to be since I’d got back from the holiday. I hadn’t watched Emily very closely on the pet camera as I’d trusted her, but my friend suggested we go back through the recordings to see if there was an explanation. 

After Emily had left from her last visit and texted to tell me she had dropped the keys through the letterbox, I could clearly see Boots watch her leave, then gaze at the cupboard door, the tip of her tail flicking. I watched the cuoboard door slowly open, just a quarter of the way, then move back and forth as if someone was moving it that I couldn’t see. Boots hissed and ran out of view. 

My friend gasped and told me to scroll back further. We caught other weird things, things in the shelf seemingly being picked up and dropped by an unseen hand, Boots’ toys being moved by themselves, weird orbs of light and the camera glitching. 

However, scrolling back further, this activity only seemed to start on the second evening. 

Scrolling back, I saw Emily emerge from the direction of the front door, with two other girls around her age, who I assumed to be her friends. I was annoyed as, as far as I knew, she said she only had her friends come with her to the last visit, but they all seemed to stay in the living room and left when she did and there was nothing I could do about it now. However, that’s not what bothered me. 

I watched as the theee girls sat on the floor, cross-legged, as Emily produced a large black rectangle from her bag. Removing what turned out to be a black sheet, it looked to be some sort of board game, and it wasn’t until I recognised a planchette being placed upon the board that I realised what it was and what they were doing. 

Their voices were too low to hear clearly what they were saying, but after a few minutes of watching them appear to ask questions and slowly move the planchette around, something seemed to happen. Their faves all went ghostly white, fhere was a large flash, Boots who had been sleeping nearby shot up and ran behind the couch cowering and the girls ran from the house, with Emily grabbing the board and planchette as she ran. 

My friend looked at me with concern. “It doesn’t look like they closed the board,” she said. “I think they let something into your house.”

I’m not sure what to do. I googled it but it says I need to burn the board and I can’t get hold of Emily. Her number is blocked, her profile has been taken down, and I have no idea what to do. I don’t feel like I can go back home with Boots.
