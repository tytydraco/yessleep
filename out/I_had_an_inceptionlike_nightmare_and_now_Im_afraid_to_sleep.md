TRUE STORY: LONG POST AHEAD

I'm [30,F] had a nightmare and now I'm scared to go to sleep.

Earlier today, I kinda woke up earlier than I usually do which wasn't good considering I have work later that day.

My shift usually starts 9pm but I woke up around 11am. Way too early.

I was supposed to go back to sleep but my husband [34,M] had already made lunch so I decided to get up and just go back to sleep after eating. So we ate then I rested for while and then opted to take in a quick nap around 2pm figuring it should be okay considering the fact that it's bad to sleep right after eating. I think 3 hrs rest should be enough so I proceeded to steal a little more zzzzz before work starts. I popped on my earbuds, played a little sleeping music then off to snoozeland.

I think maybe an hour had past, my sleep was a bit interrupted. I don't know why but I was half-awake at this point so I decided to check my phone in case I had urgent work notifs. I had 2 Whatsapp messages and 8 viber messages and 65 emails. I was still sleepy and confirmed I had only been asleep for almost 2 hours so I could use maybe an hour more or two.

I also realized my music was still playing in my ear so I removed my earplugs and turned the music off, or so I thought. After a few seconds, I could hear the music playing again. I found it strange because I'm sure I already removed my earbuds so I reached for my ear and found that it was still there. Weird but no big deal, I'll just remove it again. Then a few seconds later, I could hear the music again, I HAD EARBUDS AGAIN. I kept removing it and I would just have another pair back on my ear. Then I realized, shit I'm dreaming!

Something about me, believe it or not, is that I have certain abilities or sensitivities if you will. Anybody know Ghost Whisperer? The TV series starring JLH? That's the most accurate representation of my "abilities" and I am also able to control my dreams which I often do especially when I know I'm having nightmares. In my dreams, I would usually just close my eyes and wiggle my toes then bam! I'm back to the real world. But this one? This is fcking different.

I figured I was still dreaming so I told myself I was just gonna wake myself up like always, easy peezy. Closed my eyes, wiggle my toes, bam! Still in the dream. How do I know? The fcking music! It's still playing. At this point, I was already panicking a little but hey okay I can try again. I did, FAIL. I could see my husband beside me sleeping and our dog on the floor. So I thought, okay I'll just scream. I'll keep screaming because I know in real life it'll be equivalent to me groaning and moaning which would cause my husband to wake up me violently. Yes violently that's the only way to get me back. I tried so many times, but it's not working. I thought maybe my husband wasn't actually sleeping next to me. FULL PANIC MODE ON. I was so scared! I couldn't get out of bed and all I could tell myself was I needed to wake up or I will be trapped here. I'm gonna fcking die. I was slapping myself so hard thinking it would work. But to no avail.

Then I heard a knock, it was distinct. I had just recently bought a wooden woodpecker knocker which had a very distinct knocking sound. This gave me hope! I knew I was almost awake because this was something that was newly installed and hadn't been used other than testing so that fact that someone else is knocking means I'm almost awake. Just a little more push!

Then bam! I AM FINALLY AWAKE!!!!!! I couldn't believe it at first. I had to tap on our walls a few times to check if it would hurt. It did! I looked around and saw my husband at the foot of our bed! I have never been more excited to see my husband. I cried so hard while he hugged me.

He said, he had just gotten out of the shower when a delivery guy knocked on our door. After receiving the package, he got back to our room when he heard me moaning. He knew I was having a nightmare so he opened the lights and woke me up. I told him my dream and how I heard the knocking too but was trapped. I was bawling my eyes out at this point and can barely speak.

When I felt calmer, I checked my phone and checked my notifs. And you guessed it! 2 Whatsapp messages, 8 Viber messages and 65 emails. WTF did just happen? 

Was I dreaming? Was I awake? Was I in another dimension? IDFK.

What I know right now is that I'm fcking scared to sleep and I'm so tired. I don't know what to do.
