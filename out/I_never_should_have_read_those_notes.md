Around the time when all of this took place, I had just moved to a new town after my most recent relationship had ended. The apartment I rented was in a semi-rundown neighborhood. Not the worst, but far from the best. It was enough for a bachelor such as myself. I had a small backyard where I, if the weather was decent enough, at times, would grab a beer and relax after work. It was a Sunday; of that I'm certain. I was bored and had decided to take a stroll to kill some time. It was early autumn. The air was crisp and cool. The only greenery in the area I found myself in consisted of groves made up of leafy trees that walled off the path I was walking on from the busy two-lane expressway. Four months had passed since I moved here and apart from working at a warehouse I would sometimes go out for drinks with a couple of colleagues, if my wallet would allow it that is. So, as you can tell, my life was quite run-of-the-mill and uneventful. But that would all gradually change, from that Sunday and onwards.

I had covered most of my immediate area by foot. The only part I hadn't really explored was the aforementioned ”nature area,” located south of my neighborhood. It was Amir, a guy from work, that had told me that there had been a fire there years ago, in a now deserted industrial park. It is believed to have started in a autobody paint shop. The fire spread rapidly after that. 10 or so people died that day, while those who survived sustained injures from smoke inhalation or severe burns. Despite their best efforts, the paint shop, as well as several other buildings, burned down to the ground, before the fire department managed to put out the fire. The businesses that made it later on moved to a new industrial area, the same one were my job is located. It was never determined what exactly caused the fire, but some said that a disgruntled employee was the culprit. The autobody paint shop, in Amirs own words, ”was a place where people were treated like animals.”  The working conditions left a lot to be desired, but every attempt at forwarding complaints to HR was shut down. According to Amir, the employers were snakes who lacked even an inkling of humanity.

After a while I came across a backroad that broke away from the main path. It didn't look like much; the asphalt was cracked and overgrown with weeds. There was also an underpass littered with junk, both in and outside of it. Beer cans, porn magazines, black garbage bags containing God knows what. Yeah, you get the idea. The inner walls of the underpass were covered with graffiti, mostly in the shape of illegible tags. For a second I thought that I was entering some sort of gang territory, but even I knew that made little to no sense. As soon as I came out on the other side, I could make out the shambled remains of the old industrial park in the distance.

Earlier that day, during lunch break, I had found a thread on a forum discussing the fire. While scrolling through the comments I came across older photos taken before it all burnt down. The autobody paint shop had once been a giant building. All that remained now were blackened, skeletal structures that reminded me of a warzone in a far away country. My mind might have been playing tricks on me, but at times I could almost sense the subtle reek of chemicals and fire smoke, still hanging in the air; a tragic reminder of what had happened.

Just beyond the fire's epicenter I could make out what was left of some of the buildings. Brick walls. Roofs made out of corrugated sheet metal. Blown out windows. Shattered glass. Everything was shrouded in soot. I looked up. Encircling the industrial ghost town was a forest. Mostly birch, pine and rampant undergrowth. I had yet to encounter another person, but I didn't complain. A small voice in the back of my head told me that it was probably for the best. Who knew what kind of people would choose to roam around a place such as this, especially once it got dark. I had seen enough. It was time for me to head back. However, as I was about to start backtracking, I caught a glimpse of something by the tree line. It looked like a small trail leading further into the woods. There was something scenic to it, a stark contrast to what I had just experienced, but as I looked at my wrist watch I realized it was much later than I had thought. Tomorrow then. There's always tomorrow. And with that, I turned around and started walking.

Halfway through the underpass I saw something in the corner of my eye. Something small and white amidst the jumble of trash. I stopped dead in my tracks and crouched to take a closer look. Underneath a flipped over shopping cart was a folded piece of paper. It glowed in the dirt, like a pearl in a polluted ocean. Gently, I picked it up and that is when I noticed that it was surprisingly clean, as if it had just been put there. Intrigued, I unfolded the note. In large, childlike letters, someone had written a message using a marker. It read:

*I SEE YOU*

Intuitively, I looked around. No one there but me. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I got paranoid. For a second I had deluded myself into thinking that I was being watched. But like I said. I was alone. After all, I hadn't come across anyone while I had been in the area. The only person present was me. I glossed over the message again, but this time I caught myself smiling. This must be some sort of game I was unaware of; a way for kids to entertain themselves. They were probably nearby or maybe they had gone home to eat dinner. Either way, I ended up putting the note back where I found it, as to not disturb their little game and then went straight home. Back at the apartment I microwaved some leftovers, watched TV and passed out in my couch at roughly 11 PM. My sleep was dreamless and I more less forgot about the note I had found. But, little did I know, that that was just the beginning.

Next day was the beginning of a new work week. As usual, during lunch, I was sitting with my phone just scrolling through the Internet. Just out of curiosity I decided to see if I could find the trail I encountered on Google Maps, and wouldn't you know it, I did. Not only that, judging from what I saw, the small forested trail seemed as if would be a perfect detour to and from work. So, as we were getting off earlier that day, I decided to check it out on my bike. My initial reaction had been correct; it truly was scenic, but best of all it saved me roughly 15 minutes compared to my usual route to work. The only downside, I suppose, was that I had to pass through that underpass and this time around something even stranger, and dare I say, more frightening occurred.

As soon as I reached the crummy looking tunnel, my nostrils was assaulted by an odor that almost made me gag. It was so bad I had to stop and get off my bike. After getting done retching I noticed something to my right. Someone had attached a note on one of the walls. Luckily, I didn't have to get closer to be able to see what it said. In childlike handwriting, someone had written.

*I LIKE YOU*

I raised my eyebrows in surprise. What the hell was this? There was no mistaking it. It was the very same handwriting as the first note. By this point I also figured out that the stench was coming from the note itself. Someone, judging from the smell, had attached it using fecal matter. I could feel my gag reflexes acting up again, but as I was ready to get back on my bike, a loud, deafening sound made me jump. My ears started ringing. My temples felt as if they were about to explode. Startled, I looked around and that is when I witnessed something behind me, at the edge of the underpass. Laying on the path, were the crumbled remains of a brick. Was this a part of these kids little “game”? Now, I'm not one to loose my temper that easily, but at the moment I became enraged. Without a second though, I rushed towards the broken brick and as soon as I exited the underpass, I looked around for any sign of life. I saw nothing and no one, so I decided to look around among the trees and bushes. After 5 minutes I gave up. Whoever had thrown the projectile were long gone or perhaps they were hiding somewhere else. I decided that it was better to just head home. Later that evening I pondered whether or not I should use my old route, but you see, as a man, I am plagued by something called ”pride”. There was no way that I, a grown male, would allow myself to be scared off by a gang of misfits. So, despite my little mishap, I decided to use the detour the next day.

This time, on my way to work, I noticed that the note as well as the disgusting stench was gone. Apart from that the underpass looked undisturbed. I know how it might sound, as if I'm making excuses for this kind of behavior, but a part of me sympathized with whoever these kids were. After all, the town wasn't the most exciting. Also, Amir had told me that most of the nearby youth recreation centers had been closed down as local gangs would use them for selling drugs and even recruiting younger kids. Far-fetched, perhaps, but maybe the underpass as well as the closed down industrial park, functioned as some sort of sanctuary for the kids that lived around the area? Come to think of it, I can even recall some of the weird places me and my friends would hang out around when I was young, but not only that, we would raise hell whenever we could.

The workday went by swimmingly and at 6 PM it was time to head out. The forecast for the day was rain with less than zero chance of sunshine. However, the rain had mostly let up when I reached my detour. Due to the heavy presence of clouds, the forest was darker than usual. So for that reason I sped up as I wanted to get home as quickly as possible. However, as soon as I saw the underpass, I noticed something was extremely wrong. Someone had blocked the entrance with trash in all shapes and sizes. Initially, I thought that I could simply get off the bike and heave myself over, but that was before I noticed the rusted barbwire and sharp, pointy objects. So, I ended up parking my bike by the underpass before I started, as careful as I could as to not cut myself on anything, to remove the blockade. While I was getting my hands dirty I started thinking; how come I've yet to encounter anyone on this specific route? Above all, who would go out of their way to torment a nobody like me, but also in such an “elaborate” fashion? First the notes. Innocent, sure, but still weird. Then the brick throwing. I was honestly starting to feel somewhat uncomfortable. Roughly half-way through clearing up the trash, I spotted something. Something that made my blood run cold.

There, on the ground in front of me, stuck between two bricks, was a folded note. As if on instinct, I reached out and grabbed it. The moment the piece of paper was level with my face I sensed that smell again, but fainter this time. I should have thrown away that damn note and just left, but I didn't. Instead, curiosity got the better of me. I unfolded the note and what I saw filled me with disgust and despair.

*I WANT YOU INSIDE ME*

I just kept staring at the words in front of me. Marker pen. Same, juvenile letters. Maybe the younger, edgier me would've laughed it off, but that was then. Whatever discomfort I had felt earlier was nothing compared to what I felt at that moment. I ended up ripping the revolting message into pieces and was about to get on my bike when I heard something. I couldn't quite make it out, but it had come from somewhere further up one of the tree-covered slopes that lined the path. Was I being watched? I guess the old saying rings true. ”A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime”. I had to remind myself that I was more than likely just dealing with a bunch of kids. A couple of really messed up kids, but still. So, with that in mind, I puffed up my chest and yelled, in the most authoritarian voice I could muster:

” Okay you little shits! This isn't funny. Come out so…”

My newly found bravery shattered the second a rock, the size of a fist, landed right next to me. I yelled out in panic and fell into my bike. A few inches to the left and I would've been done for.

” What the hell is wrong with you?! Just wait there…”

Yet again, I was interrupted, but not by yet another rock. This time, I could hear the distinct sound of laughter, but something was” off” about it. On one end it sounded like a young boy going through puberty, on the other it had this strange, artificial quality. It might sound comedic, but let me assure you, I was not amused. Whatever the case, I was not going to investigate further until I had armed myself. After rummaging through the garbage, I found a rusty steel pipe. Then, I started sneaking up towards the trees. As soon as I reached the forest edge, I started crouch-walking. If I played my cards right, I might get the jump on the person or persons. But no matter how thoroughly I searched, I saw no signs of anyone. I started feeling stupid. Here I was, a grown man armed with a steel pipe, on the look-out for teen delinquents. The grip on my makeshift weapon loosened the more the realization sunk in. I was better than this. I would not resort to violence. Instead, I was just going to take my old route from now on. It was then that I heard a twig snap deeper in the woods. I froze, my grip tightening yet again. Listening closely, I could hear the footsteps of someone moving around further ahead. Whoever it was, they did not want to be seen.

I was faced with two options: 1) I could pursue them or 2) I could just head straight home and forget all about it. Life would go on and the last days events would be chalked up to some kids playing a horrible prank on me. But of course, there was a small lingering voice that told me that ”they” needed to be taught a lesson. They had gone too far. This was no longer a mere joke. So with that, I resumed my search, carefully looking around, ready for anything or so, I thought. Roughly ten minutes later, the trees started to thin out to reveal a small clearing. Situated in the center of it was a small, ramshackle shack. On first glance it didn't look like a place where people had once lived. Rather, it seemed to be some sort of tool shed. The roof had caved in under the weight of a fallen tree that still weighed down the structure. Roof tiles laid scattered and broken in the wild undergrowth. Whatever paint that had once covered the walls had started to peel away, exposing rotting planks beneath. From where I was standing, I couldn't see an entrance, but I could make out two windows. It was too dark in there to see anything, but the more I looked, the more uneasy I felt.  All was quiet. The silence hung like a dark cloud over the small structure; a leftover artefact from a bygone era. Kids or not, I actually felt somewhat scared. I had no idea what I was walking into. You see, young people can be just as capable of carrying out acts of violence as adults. I had to brace myself for a minute before I regained my composure. Then it slowly started to dawn on me; could this be their hideout? Regardless, I had come this far and I couldn't turn back now. However, I decided to not do anything too drastic. Just scare them a little. So, I grabbed the pipe and struck the closest tree while shouting:

”I got you now!”

There I was, thinking that I had them and that they would come crawling out of the shed, regretful, ready to apologize. How wrong I was. When I was about to deliver yet another blow, that odd-sounding laughter returned, only it was closer this time. Much closer and far more intense. With that said, I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from since the sickening clucking seemed to bounce from tree to tree; constantly assaulting my senses. I ended up covering my ears, but as if that wasn't horrible enough; that all too familiar stench returned. I could feel my lunch working its way up my throat. That smell. My god, how do I even start to explain? Imagine a sickening cocktail of pus-filled wounds, decaying flesh and feces, but even that is an understatement on how awful it truly was. What could've produced such an odor? Stink bombs? Dead animals? My eyes started tearing up. I had to get away. So, I ran, as fast I could. Away from that horrible reek. Away from that haunting laughter. I can't recount how many times I tripped and got up, the countless lashes from branches as they struck my face and hands. At long last, I saw the underpass. Thank God! The bike was still there. I slid down the slope, got up and then flew up on the seat, and started pedaling for my life. The dark forest, a dense blur in my periphery, my eyes remained focused on the path ahead of me. I never looked back. Not even once.

Back home, I jumped in the shower and spent 30 minutes scrubbing away the disgusting filth that had clung to my skin. As it eventually dissipated, so did the chilling laughter that had plagued me the entire ride home. Exhausted, I collapsed in the couch with a cold beer. It tasted somewhat funky, but I desperately needed it to calm my nerves. My tired eyes looked up at the ceiling. That was it, I thought to myself. Those sick little bastards had won the war. Whoever they were, they were out of their minds, but I accepted defeat. I would never use that detour again. My entire body ached and eventually I passed out.

My head was pounding when I woke up to my phone ringing. It was Amir, asking me why the hell I wasn't at work. I looked at the time. Of course, I had overslept. Goddammit. I didn't even bother with breakfast - just slipped into my clothes and rushed to work. Luckily, Amir had talked with our supervisor before I arrived. Not sure what he said, but whatever it was it worked, as I didn't get fired. For most of the day, I felt like a zombie restocking shelves, processing and packing orders as well as counting inventory. People could probably tell that something was up, as I kept my distance, even during smoke breaks. On one of those breaks, as I took some deep drags from my cigarette, I could hear someone approaching me from behind. I turned around. It was Amir. He fumbled with his zippo lighter before he managed to light up. His deep, brown eyes bore into my soul as the nicotine-filled smoke escaped from his lips before he spoke:

”Man, you look rough. What have you been up to?”

I rubbed my bleary eyes before replying:

”It's…it's nothing. Just had trouble falling asleep.”

”Yeah? And why is that? You up to no good?” Good ol' Amir. Brazen as usual, something I've grown to appreciate over the months we've gotten to know each other. I scratched my head, avoiding his penetrating gaze before our eyes met.

Should I tell him? I hesitated, but I could tell that Amir wouldn't cut me any slack. So I straight up told him about the notes, the gang of kids and how they had harassed me every day on my way home from work. He grinned and took another drag.

”Yeah? That bad, huh? By the way, where did you say this was?”

”By that underpass.. you know, close that to that abandoned industrial park? You know, the one that burnt down all that time ago?”

In an instant, Amirs smile dropped. His eyes become more intense.

”You gotta promise me to never go there again, ever. You hear me?”

I was shocked. Amir had always been a laid-back guy who never got riled up about anything; a smooth talker and a go-getter. The seconds dragged on. No one said anything. Amir's face remained stoic. Eventually I chuckled nervously.

”Trust me, I won't. But like I said, it was just a bunch of-”

Out of nowhere, Amir shot out his arm and grabbed me by the collar. He then drew me closer.

”John… I'm not joking, ok?” Amir sounded stern.

He then looked over his shoulder as to make sure that no one was eaves-dropping our conversation. Once he was assured that we were alone, he let go off me and started telling me things, strange things, about the underpass. Apparently, it was rumored to be haunted. According to his sources, whom he never disclosed, there was something there that tainted its surroundings. That was the reason why you never saw any animals there or even heard birds chirping. Also, whenever people passed through, they would hear weird noises and feel a strange, unearthly presences. Some even said that the woods were haunted by those who died in the industrial park fire. I felt a chill running down my neck. Amir continued:

”But man, believe me, it gets worse. A couple of months before you moved in, something really weird happened. There was this kid who went to the same school as my younger brother. One day, he didn't show up after school. At first his parents thought he was just hanging out with some friends and that he would get back to them.”

He paused, pulled a deep drag and glanced over his shoulder again. A small group of co-workers had amassed in the parking-lot, outside the warehouse, smoking and talking. I can understand why he was on edge, because if anyone had heard us, they would've thought Amir was crazy.

”One day passes. The kid never called or messaged his parents, and he never replied when they tried to get in touch with him. The police, hell, the entire community got involved in looking for him. Three days later they find something.”

I couldn't help myself but ask: ”W-what did they find?”

”It was a small sneaker. They found it inside that very same underpass. But no blood, no body. The parents identified it as belonging to their son. But no matter how thoroughly they searched that area, they found nothing. After a couple of weeks they just accepted that he was gone, almost as if the ground had swallowed him.” 

First a gang of weird kids, then a haunted underpass and now a missing child? I had lived in that town for 4 months, but this was the first time I had heard about it. I looked at Amir, trying to figure out if he was just messing with me. Then I noticed it; how the corner of his mouth was twitching, as if trying to contain himself from laughing. That son of a bitch. I should've known better.

”What the hell, Amir!” I pushed him, with more force than I had intended.

I half-expected Amir to lash out at me, but that did not happen. Instead, his contagious laugh echoed over the parking lot. Thankfully, no one had seen me acting out. Once he was done laughing, he walked up to me, put his arm over my shoulder. His breath smelled heavy of cigarette smoke. Amir’s face cracked into a huge, shit-eating grin.

”Come on, John. You don't believe in ghosts, do you?”

I tried to play it cool.

”N-no. Of course not. That's just stupid.” A forced smile spread across my face as I untangled myself from his arm.

”So... everything you said was just bullshit?”

Amir's face grew a bit colder. He lowered his head, as if he felt ashamed.

”Not the thing about the kid. Like I said, they never found him.”

”Yeah, so you told me. But, what do you think happened?”

He shrugged and started walking back to the warehouse. I followed suite. On our way back he said:

”No idea. Maybe he ran away? I think that kid had a pretty rough situation at home, you know? I recall my brother telling me that his parents were divorced. Apparently, the dad was a heavy drinker. Not sure about the mother. Regardless, it's tragic all the same.”

I nodded in agreement. As we were about to resume our shift Amir patted me on the back.

”By the way, me, Diego and Ben are going to hit the bar after work. Care to join? Drinks on me, of course.”

I smiled. ”Wouldn't mind that at all, even if you're a bit of an asshole at times.”

We ended going to the usual place; drank, relaxed, complained about co-workers we couldn't stand, supervisors that we hated; the same old chagrins. As we had work the next day we called it quits pretty early and went our separate ways around 11:00 PM. Honestly, I was pretty hammered, but I still managed to make my way home without any misadventures. The memories of the underpass and what I had experienced, had been pushed down further in the depths of my mind for every beer I had chugged. I was drowsy; but content. The disappearance of the kid, however, was harder to ignore. What a nightmare. All things considered; all the strangeness that had occurred at that underpass, I was still convinced that he had ran off, especially if his home situation really was as bad as Amir had stated. Wherever he was, I hoped that he was safe. The moment I got home I took a quick shower, brushed my teeth and then passed out in my bed on top of the covers.

At around 2:00 PM, my bladder started bothering me. I crawled out of bed and made my way to the bathroom just in time. On the way back I groggily glance towards the backdoor leading out to my backyard, and at that moment... I froze. I went from half-drunk to sober in an instant. There, resting on my plastic, outdoor table, amidst empty beer cans, I saw a small, folded note. As soon as I registered what I was looking at, I bolted towards the door, unlocked it, swung it open and ran up to the table. The cold night air made my skin prickle, but I didn't even wince, my attention so fully honed in on that small, seemingly insignificant piece of paper. I grabbed it and without making sure whether or not I was alone, I unfolded it and read. I wasn't sure what I had expected, but what I saw, written in that horrible handwriting was one, simple word.

*HI*

My heart dropped. How was this even possible? Somehow, those little shits had figured out where I lived. How was that even possible? My hands were shaking as I slowly looked up, ready to face my tormentors. There was no one there. Just my unkempt lawn. The asphalted bike lane just beyond the waste-high picket fence, illuminated by the sickly orange glow of a lonely light post. On the opposite side of the lane, I could see three smaller trees and some bushes, huddled together. And even further beyond that; rows upon rows of apartments, all identical with their concrete grey hues. The distant glow of lit-up apartment windows reminded me of fire flies, and from one of them I could vaguely make out someone playing music. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just another night in my semi-rundown neighborhood and as soon as that became evident to me, I realized how cold it was outside. I turned around and was about to go inside when the sound of exploding glass shook me to my core.

Everything had happened so fast, but despite that, I could still feel how ”something” swept by me with such velocity, that I felt a burning sensation on my left cheek. I spun around. In the window, closest to the backyard door, was a huge gaping hole. Countless shards of broken glass laid scattered over the carpet. That. Fucking. Does. It. I looked out, but couldn't see whoever had destroyed my property. Thankfully, as I didn't need the attention, the neighbors didn't seem to have reacted. I carefully watched my step as I went to fetch my phone. Once I had it on my person, I dialed 911 while keeping watch from behind the curtains. While waiting for someone to respond I looked at the disarray within the apartment. I caught glimpse of something; namely, the projectile that had been launched at me. It was not a rock, nor a brick. It was a small sneaker. Amir's words suddenly came back: ”No body, no blood.” What the fuck was going? It was then that a woman responded to my call.

”911, what's your emergency?”

I couldn't speak. My eyes were fixed on the object before me. In the dim light of the moon that bled into my apartment, I could swear that I saw dark stains along the collar lining. Could it be... blood? The dispatcher's voice sounded again:

”Hello? Anyone there? Please respond.”

”Yeah, s-sorry.. I would like-”

I didn't make it further than that, for in the night air, I heard it – the eerie, clucking laughter. The woman's voice sounded as if it was a million miles away. It didn't take long for the repugnant stench to make itself known. It coated my tongue like a disgusting film, made me violently cough and retch. But in spite of all the horrifying impressions that my senses could detect, I did not flee. You see, I couldn't. I had to, needed to, identify my tormentors. I convinced myself that only then could I feel release. So, I slowly turned around expecting to see the cruel, demented smiles of my teenage harassers, but what I saw will forever infest my thoughts until the day I die.

From the bushes, across the bike lane, a figure crawled out on its belly. It was naked. Its torso, arms and legs, were covered in third degree burns. Red, blistered patches of swollen skin. Boils ready to burst. Even though his appearance, I could tell that it was a man or at least the shell of one. What chocked me the most was how crooked he was. The upper body somehow appeared to be ”hanging” limply as it gradually began to rise, as if it was bent over backwards. It is impossible fully describe all of the disfigured man’s features; this grim parody of human anatomy. But there is one small detail that I shall never forget. As his pale, withered tongue oscillated along his decaying teeth, he raised a hand. The two, still intact fingers, pointed at me, then back at him and as he did so, I could see him mouthing something. Although charred and deformed, I could still make out what those lips said:

”...I....see.... you....”
