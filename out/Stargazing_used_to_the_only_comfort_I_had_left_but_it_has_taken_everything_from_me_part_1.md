I ventured out to the shore of my cabin as I had habitually for several months now. The air was calm and cool and the sky was as gorgeous as a clear night sky could be. It was all exactly as it should be. I began by aligning the equatorial mount, ensuring the telescope’s axis was parallel to the Earth’s rotation. Then, loosening the declination lock, I rotated the tube gently toward my celestial target. A little to the left. A bit to the right. Then, just a touch more to the left. I made minute adjustments to the right ascension, nudging the telescope ever so slightly eastward. As I peered into the lens, I froze; a cruel red eye seemed to stare back at me, recognizing me from across an impossible distance. A smile crept across my face, and I let out a breath—a mingling of awe and a premonition of unease—at the sight of Jupiter’s perpetually tumultuous red storm.

“Still as magnificent as the first time, aren't you?” I murmured to the distant giant, a ritual acknowledgment of what had become my silent companion in the solitude I had retreated into.

I stood, peering into one side of what now was a lone window into a night that no longer seemed empty, face to face with a gaze that met me from 714 million kilometers away. My hands, eager to capture the moment, adjusted the knobs to further enhance the glowing crimson dot before me. The cogs whined in protest, an anomaly given my frequent lubrication and meticulous care for my instruments. I rustled for my dilapidated notebook, eager to transcribe my observations. The night air, imbued with the chill of the encroaching sea, carried whispers that made the hairs on my nape stand sentinel.

"Every night, you speak," I spoke softly, as if afraid to break the sacred silence of my observations. “I would give anything to understand.”

I traced my sketch of the storm with my finger, the red dot a beautiful marble typhoon as uncontrollable as it was admirable. It brought me great comfort to understand now how peaceful something could look despite the chaotic nature of its reality. The storm allowed me to grieve, granting me the only sympathy I could in the paradoxical turmoil and tranquility of the phenomenon. I don't speak about it much, but all that matters is that I used to have things that I do not any more, and I am only accompanied by heavenly bodies that will never feel my touch.

Without a premonition, the gentle seaside breeze shifted to an uneasy gale, and an acrid scent of ozone filled the air, unsettling my nostrils, and a distant, rumbling hum vibrated through the ground beneath my feet. Drawn irresistibly back to the telescope, my gaze pulled me by my skin towards the glass entrance, the notebook slipping from my grasp as I peered into the tunnel again. The red dot began to swirl and beat with a sentient intensity, as shadows at the corner of my vision grew closer with every blink.

"Dear god…What are you showing me?" I gasped, my voice a mix of elation and rising dread. “Please. Please…”

A scientific curiosity tugged at me at first, but just as quickly evolved into a primal horror as I found myself suddenly breathless, as if my veins were individually constricting, suffocating me from within.

“Dear god. Dear god.” I thought.

My heart pounded, and despite clutching my chest, I could feel no physical sensation beyond a devastating nausea. My arms fell to my side, and my conscious experience was reduced to no sensation but all-encompassing terror. Tears blurred my vision as I remained inexorably glued to the lens. Struggling for words, only a dull drone escaped my lips. My bones cried out under the weight of the frigid night air as I felt immense pressure on my head and the soft tissue of my brain. I found myself at the threshold of an endless black corridor—no floor beneath me, no walls for support, no roof for shelter.

"DEAR GOD. OH GOD ALMIGHTY," I thought, believing I was screaming, yet overwhelmed by the suffocating intensity of the silence around me.

The red iris fixated on me, and the heavens abruptly converged into a blinding beacon, a piercing luminescence that sought me out from across the void. The red light bled ferociously throughout the corridor, spiraling from the red eye at hopeless speeds. Its gaze intensified, and the celestial spear gored me with the force of revelation, searing into the depths of my being. As its incandescent tendrils dissolved once again into the void, they left in their wake a mosaic of images—harrowing and vivid portents of calamity and ruin. I ripped my eyes from the telescope, and I could no longer tell if I was standing on solid ground, laying down, or if my mortal experience had ceased completely. I saw no sea, no grass, no sky, and no home. 

My torturous solitude was fleeting, and I soon was accompanied by shadows of what I understood as once humans, now twisted and unrecognizable forms, devoid of their flesh and sentience, clawing at me and piercing the dreadful silence with shrill and cacophonous screams. I understood I was falling, and around me I saw thousands torn limb from limb and decayed from within by an insidious force. Hellfire engulfed all that I could see, and I ceased to breathe until my consciousness surrendered to the overwhelming anxiety that engulfed me, and the crushing fear of what I beheld finally subsided.

 I fell to the ground, the cold grass a stark contrast to the inferno that had surrounded me. Alas, even the rest that forcibly took hold of me and stripped me of my awareness was no deliverance. The once benign watchers of the night had unveiled their apocalyptic chorus, and I had become an unwitting vessel. In the silence that followed, as the echoes of the visions’ fury faded, a more cruel whisper took root, one that begged and cried out to me, shrieking at me to act upon vile and despicable urges. The desperate cries came to me in my own voice, begging and screeching to be released from my own hell. With each cry, the pain and fear in my being grew, and even in sleep I writhed in fruitless protest.

"Leave me be," I mustered into the darkness, clutching the grass, seeking any anchor in the madness that enveloped me. "I am but a watcher. I am but a watcher.” I repeated, my voice quivering, “Please. Please forgive me."
