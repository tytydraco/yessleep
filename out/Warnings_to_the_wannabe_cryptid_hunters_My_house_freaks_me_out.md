I woke up to feel my feet dangling in the air and wind ruffling my skirts. Even before I opened my eyes, I realized I was lying on a wooden surface. Twigs were pricking my side, prompting me to turn and roll over. I wasn't done sleeping. Just a little bit longer. This certainly wasn't the most cozy place to rest, but somehow, it gave me this wonderful feeling of comfort and safety. Of home. 

I was then poked with a stick. I groaned.

"Ha! Told you!" I heard the familiar voice of the red-haired fairy exclaim in joy. 

The Leshy pulled back his finger with a rumbling sigh. *"That's a relief."*

I slowly sat up, eyes fluttering open, a smile spreading on my face before I could even collect my thoughts. "It's good to see you. How long was I out for?" I asked Aleksei.

He raised his head, prompting me to look around. Cold rays of sunlight were making their way over the horizon, not yet touching the treetops but reaching the meadow, painting it an even brighter shade of red. I let go of a long, deep sigh. This was my land, the picture of icy serenity. Life, raw and unregulated, pure in the most untamed sense of the word. Maybe not hallowed, but sacred in its own right. Home. 

*"The entire night,"* the wood-demon told me.

I nodded. Good. The boys were unlikely to be up yet, saving them a lot of concern. A look over at the house confirmed my assumption—it was lying in utter peace and silence. That's when I realized I was kind of looking down on everything. The Leshy was standing upright, the fairy cowering on his shoulder. He towered over even the tallest of trees, cradling me in the palm of his hand. My snow boots were hanging down freely, as was a good portion of my wide, layered skirt. "We're so high up. I love this."

*"I got that impression the first time I held you,"* Aleksei replied, eyes glowing almost fondly. *"Will you let me know what you've achieved?"*

"I don't think I should," I replied. "I'm pretty sure you'll see for yourself soon enough."

**Where from do I know this being?** the low voice that could not be defined rang out in my mind. **He feels familiar.**

*You've met him before, when he was just a kid. A really long time ago,* I answered wordlessly. *You kind of owe him an apology for what happened with Arkadiusz.* To Aleksei, I said, "I hope you weren't too worried when I didn't wake up right away."

The wood-demon let out a derisive snort, turning to look the other way. He carried me across the red meadow, where now, finally, Arkadiusz' body was beginning to decompose. I felt a strange sense of peace settling over my soul. After gently setting me down on the porch, Aleksei straightened his arm, allowing the redheaded fairy to slide down off of it. It looked so effortless and playful that I couldn't help but wonder how many times she'd done that before. 

"So, I take it you were satisfied with my goods?" she asked, boldly raising her hands to her hips. 

"Very much so."

"I'm very glad to hear that. Now, it is time for you to make good on *your* end of the bargain. As I have no doubt you'll manage." She grinned, lifting a brow. "It won't be easy. But you *are* obligated to, as they say, deliver. Don't forget that."

I nodded, a smile playing on my lips.

Returning inside, I hastily grabbed the note I'd left for the boys, crumpled it up and threw it away. Creeping up the stairs, I was careful not to be noisy. I peeked into Casimir's room to see him passed out with his hair mussy like a big bird's nest in the absence of gel. Gently shutting the door again, I made my way over to where I could hear Jacek's snoring. I tiptoed over to his bed where he was lying face-down in his pillow. I cautiously lowered myself down on the mattress beside him and began to run my fingertips over the back of his head. I allowed my thoughts to wander for merely a minute before straightening, adjusting my skirt and taking a long, cleansing breath. Just as I was turning to leave, Jacek stirred, rolling over in bed with a deep hum. His eyes blinked open, and he squinted at me. "Whatcha say?" he cawed, clearing his throat.

"I didn't say anything," I replied. "Didn't mean to wake you."

He grinned lazily, rubbing his forehead. "I had a nice dream."

"Yeah? What about?" I asked, sitting back down by his side. 

He reached for the glass of water on his nightstand, took a sip, gurgled and spit it back out. "Not gonna tell you just like that." He dropped back into his pillows, crossing his wrists above his head. "Why don't you tie me to the bedframe and get it out of me?"

There's probably not a single other person who could make an invitation like that sound so sincere and casual. I stared at him for a beat, giving a sigh. "Got no cuffs up here anymore. It's all in the basement. If I go down there now, I'm just gonna be reminded of Dad and how he's all gross and dead. I wouldn't be in the mood anymore."

"Understandable."

"Don't look so disappointed, you know I can make do without," I answered, grinning as I climbed onto the bed with him. I'll spare you the details. We were mostly focused on keeping quiet anyways. I didn't want to traumatize my poor brother any further. It was pretty amazing, though.

"You've learned some new moves," I couldn't refrain from remarking as I pulled him into a loose hug.

"Yeah, well, you live in hell for ten years, you're bound to pick up on some stuff," he said comfortably.

"Didn't even have to explain what to touch or nothing."

"Oh, shut up," he grumbled, fondly batting at the hand I'd buried in his hair but ending up just bringing it down to interlace our fingers instead. "Damn, but I'm happy right now."

"Were you hoping this would happen when you first got my text?" I inquired.

"I don't know. I guess I was always hoping." He gave a deep, rumbling sigh. "Here's the thing," he began, sounding almost dejected, "I'm pathetic like that—I never could forget about you. I tried, believe me. It's not exactly good for your self-esteem when you wake up one day and realize you're in your thirties and still carry a torch for your first-ever girlfriend. But when you told me to come, I mean… I didn't even think twice about it. See, when you dangle the chance of being with you anywhere within reach of me, I'll *always* come running." He took a long breath, closing his eyes. "I love you. Either I fell for you again or I never actually stopped; I honestly can't tell. But I do love you. And I don't need you to say it back, I just like the way you've been looking at me and I wanna keep that in my life. I know you care about me. That's enough."

I felt like I'd already heard him say all those things. Or maybe I'd simply known. "I love you, too," I murmured, heart thumping. I'd never felt this bare in my life.

"Uh, what?" He sounded genuinely taken aback, so much so that I couldn't help but turn red. 

"What do you mean, what?" I muttered into the pillow I buried the side of my face against.

Jacek laughed out loud. "I'm sorry! I really, really did not expect you'd ever… I kinda felt like you did but hearing it is something else, I just… wow. Could you say it again? Please?"

I scoffed, turning further to hide my burning cheeks. "I love you."

"Louder? Come on. For me."

"I love you."

"Didn't quite hear you there."

"You're a smug-ass bastard, aren't you?" I hissed.

"Hard not to be right now. I mean, you're holding me."

"You need to leave," I blurted out, the words leaving my mouth before I could stop myself.

His face fell. "What?"

"You need to go. I can't have you around when Nick comes back."

"But I want to help you!"

"Exactly!" I pushed myself up into a sitting position. "You want to stay in Nick's service, right? You can't stand by me this firmly if you want to keep your job. You've built this entire career with him, you've become so powerful, you don't want to lose that, do you? You made this whole other life for yourself…"

"But it's not good enough. It's not good enough if you're not in it."

"You'd miss it, though, wouldn't you? This isn't just something you were born into and *had* to do, this is something you really worked to achieve, by whatever grim means necessary. I don't wanna be responsible for you losing that. And Lord knows what Nick would do when you'd quit. He's bound to fly into a frenzy," I sputtered, stumbling over my words. "Believe me, I don't want you to go." We locked eyes, his inkwell gaze boring into mine. "This doesn't mean we can't be together. We can work something out for sure, but not with the Devil breathing down my neck. Because he's gonna show up here, and then he'll think you've turned on him, and it'll just add to the fuel. I gotta deal with him alone. He's not gonna kill me. Jacek, I've got a plan. Or rather, we do."

"We?"

"I've gained an ally." I smiled as I heard a voice in the back of my head coo reassuringly. "I'm going to be okay."

"Hell. You know what you're asking of me here, right? How am I supposed to do this?"

"Just trust me. It's gonna work out. I swear." I gently rested my palm on his chest. 

His pale, wide, entirely whole chest. 

"Oh my God," I breathed. 

Jacek's chin hit his chest as he looked down. His hand flew to his heart, the beating tangible beneath the skin. I jumped to my feet, still butt-naked, and grabbed the first item of clothing I could find—Jacek's discarded black sweater. I pulled it on and raised my arms, staring at the sleeves in shock and astonishment. The miller burst out laughing; a joyful, incredulous laugh, watching as I twirled in front of the closet mirror. "Okay, give it back then!" he panted. "I'm heading out. And I'll stay away two days, no longer, because you're not getting rid of me this time."

"Deal," I said softly, turning to face him. "Tell Nick to get up here. I'm ready to see him."

I accompanied Jacek outside. As we stepped onto the porch, he suddenly began to pull his jacket off and removed it again. Now only in his undershirt, he held the black sweater I'd returned to him mere minutes ago out to me, a hopeful smile on his lips. I grabbed it and put it on over my dress. It smelled of smoke, a very faint, subtle cologne and, strangely enough, french fries. The warmth of his skin still clung to the fabric. 

"Better than flowers," I told him with a smile. 

He laughed quietly, then turned over his shoulder and gave me a wave before disappearing in a burst of flames. I looked out at the scorched, molten valley he'd left in the snow for a short while before going back inside. The sound of the shower running told me that my brother had found his way out of bed at last. I sank down on the living room sofa, waiting for him to finally grace me with his presence.

"So, you got back with him?" his voice rang out from behind me. "Called it."

I craned my neck to look back at him. "Can you read my mind? Or is telling when two people hooked up just like an instinct of yours?"

"Not so much an instinct as you two thinking you're a lot quieter than you actually are."

"Oh. Sorry."

"It's cool. If sixteen year-old Cas could handle it, thirty year-old Cas will, too." He gave me a cheesy grin. "With a minimal amount of therapy." He plopped down beside me, only for his jaw to drop. "You're wearing something else! Your curse! Is it gone?"

"I guess so," I muttered, folding my hands in my lap. 

"You don't sound so thrilled."

I gave a bitter chuckle. "Funny thing is, I think I'm going to miss wearing wedding gowns. They make me feel so pretty. Plus, I've really gotten used to them, and they really don't hold me back like they used to. I don't wanna take a swim in one again, but… you know."

Casimir shrugged. "You ask me, you don't need an excuse to wear those things. Just do it. Whatever floats your boat."

"Folks are gonna think I'm weird."

"They do that already."

"Huh."

We sat in silence for a moment before I placed my arm around his shoulder and pulled him close. After staying close for a little while, I let go of my brother, straightened up and told him to leave. His reaction wasn't all that different from Jacek's. 

"Have you gone crazy?" he sputtered. "I'm not leaving you alone out here! You wanna go up against Nick on your own? You got a death wish or something?" 

"I won't be on my own. I'll be okay, I know I will. And I only want you to leave for a little while, just, like, a day or so. I'll text you as soon as everything is over, I promise."

"You can't be serious."

"Please, Casimir."

"Don't do that. Don't *big-sister* me."

"Look at it this way. I'm about to have a difficult discussion. And Nick is easily aggravated, and he's got a huge hard-on for you anyways. He's gonna get angry as shit, and he's gonna wanna hurt me. Well, he won't be able to. But if you're around, he'll have the perfect guy to take it out on. And I don't want it to come to that."

My brother's gaze darkened, handsome features derailing in somber comprehension. "I'm scared," he said softly. 

"I know. Me too."

He grabbed my hand, long fingers curling around mine. "Fi…"

I swallowed the lump in my throat. My tongue felt like sandpaper scraping the roof of my mouth. "I love you. I love you and I'm so fucking glad you're my brother."

In a heartbeat, Casimir's arms were around me, squeezing me so hard I let out a strangled yelp. "Listen, you gotta promise you'll be okay. If not, I'm just gonna freak. And I'll tear everything apart. Which will suck because I'm not really the berserk-type, but you're the best thing in my life. My best anything." He reluctantly let go of me, returning upstairs to change into something warmer before heading out. I watched from my window as he got into his car and slowly drove off the property, tires leaving sharp tracks in the snow. 

I was left alone. Entirely alone. For the first time in what seemed like ages, this large old house was completely empty except for me. 

All I could do now was wait. 

My body was vibrating with nervous energy. I couldn't sit still for even a moment. I pulled off the sweater, changed into another, poofier wedding dress just for the hell of it, then put the sweater back on, then took it off again. I went to feed Jeannette and Licorice, both animals were hanging out in the stables and seemingly getting along just fine. Not much of a surprise, considering I'd always thought that hard-headed mule must have some relation to the Devil. The dog allowed me to give it a scratch, and I assured him that his master would be back this time. Out of pure boredom and anxiety, I proceeded to clean every surface I could find in my home. When I couldn't think of anything else to do, I simply sat down again and started writing. The next time I looked up, my heart sank—it was entirely dark outside. 

Beyond my windows, everything was pitch-black. 

I quickly turned on all the lights in the living room. A glance at my phone told me it was two in the afternoon. It's true that night sets in quickly here in the winter months, but this was impossible. The familiar feeling of fear creeping into my chest and pooling in my stomach like a cold, thick liquid had my thoughts racing. I wiped my suddenly sweat-laced palms on my skirt as I made my way from window to window, peering out of each one in the hopes of maybe spotting at least a single ray of light. No such luck, of course. *This was how Nick was going to play, wasn't it?* I had only gotten small glimpses of his mind-bending abilities, but it suited him well enough. I told myself that he was only trying to scare me again. That was correct, obviously. He had been trying to intimidate me every chance he'd gotten thus far, but it was difficult not to let it get to me when he was really bringing out the big guns now.

"Come out already!" I shouted into the empty hallway. 

No response.

My temples were throbbing. "Stop fucking with me!" I barked at the silence. Still nothing. Of course. Desperate, I willed my mind to calm, only for the pang of fright to flare up again when an unnerving sound reached my ears. Scratching. Nails on a chalkboard? No. Metal on glass? It was a grating, screeching noise that caused the hairs on the back of my neck to stand up. It mixed with the howls of sudden, violent gusts of wind, fiercer than any I'd ever heard before. They rattled the window frames, sweeping along the walls of the house and pushing down on the roof, eliciting wooden groans and creaks. I jumped, barely able to stifle a sharp scream when I heard several doors slam upstairs. 

"Bastard!" I cried out, hoping for the fury to mask the terror in my voice. "Where are you?" I ran to grab onto the handle of the living room door just as it was about to fly open and bang shut as well. It shook in my grip, trembling so strongly I had to yank my hand away. "I thought you wanted to talk this out like adults!" What even made me assume that in the first place? Ignoring the frantic pounding of my heart, I rushed up the stairs, bursting into each room, checking if by any chance he was lurking in some unlit corner. My search yielded no results. The cacophony of noises continued, only picking up in volume, and I staggered back downstairs, hands covering my ears. 

I had to get out. I needed air. I needed to see if this was real, or if the darkness was only in my head. I ran to tear open the front door, realizing in horror that it didn't budge. My arms kept frantically pulling at it, as if they were entities separate from myself. By some miracle, the door finally responded to my force, flying open and sending me staggering back. I tripped over my own feet, gracelessly falling onto my butt as I stated at the gaping black maw that had materialized before me. There was nothing there. It was not just the absence of light, it was the absence of *everything*. And from this nothingness, a familiar figure leapt out. 

The hellhound was upon me before I managed to get back up. I shrieked, instantly raising my hands over my head to shield my face and throat from his enormous snout. 

"Licorice!" 

I called his name in a vain attempt to get through to him. He wasn't himself—gone was the reluctantly obedient, lazily docile dog I'd come to know. His fiery eyes made for a disheartening reminder of whom he truly was in servitude of. *I should have told Jacek to take him along.* This senseless thought flashed through my mind as I pushed myself to my feet, shoving the dog off of me in a feat of strength that only a burst of adrenaline could explain. I threw myself against the huge animal's flank, shoving him back into the direction of the open doorway. The sound of his claws scraping across the floor made me wince. He was far too heavy—I barely got him to move two or three feet when his head whipped around and struck me, bashing right into my chest. I folded like an umbrella, every bit of air leaving my body in a heavy gasp as I hit the ground. 

Licorice's snout came dangerously close to my neck once more, gigantic teeth bared and glinting in the dim light. Specks of slobber landed on my cheeks as the hound's hot breath hit my skin. His jaws opened wider and wider, tongue lolling out, every inhale accompanied by a low growl.

All of a sudden, a familiar voice in the back of my head piped up. **You're terrified again. Why? Is it the dog?**

Compelled by an unseen force, I slowly reached my hand up and placed it behind one of Licorice's large ears, fingers digging into the short black fur, scratching gentle circles.

**The poor creature does not know what it's doing. It cannot help itself,** the Evening Redness whispered to me. **But we can.**

The dog had stopped mid-motion, mouth closing. His eyes had lost some of their frenzy, the snarl on his face softening. 

**It was only moved to terrorize you. It will not harm you. Its only task is to weaken your mind.** 

I looked up at the hand caressing the hellhound, fresh tears still blurring my vision. Still in utter disbelief, I watched as Licorice straightened up, sniffing my hand and giving it a short lick before turning around to trot back into the darkness. 

I pushed myself up. "Holy shit. Thank you. Thank you so much." I said the words out loud, but the sleeper appeared to hear them nevertheless.

**There is much to be accomplished with a conduit such as yourself.** The entity's tone somehow sounded mirthful. Relaxed. Confident. **Calm yourself. The creature with the big teeth is gone. Everything else is only a dream.**

*It's not real?*

**No. He is running images through your mind. I can keep him out, if you let me. All you need to do is calm yourself and let me in.**

*But you're in already.*

**Deeper.**

*You're sure we can make it?*

**Trust me.**

Pleasure. Warmth. Like someone was petting me from the inside. A soft breath of relief escaped my lips. I wasn't alone. It felt good not to be by myself. 

**You have absolutely no reason to be afraid, my dearest. Sit. Just sit and be ready for what's to come.**

I moved over to the armchair, sinking down as though my knees were giving in. 

**Don't fear.**

Whatever the sleeper was doing, it worked. My breathing slowed and my pulse stopped thrumming in my ears.

**You will not die.**

I crossed my legs and folded my hands in my lap.

**You will not falter.**

I squared my shoulders and lifted my head. A smile began to unfurl on my lips as the chaos around me seemed to fade away, dissolving into silence at last. 

"Whenever you're ready, Nick."
