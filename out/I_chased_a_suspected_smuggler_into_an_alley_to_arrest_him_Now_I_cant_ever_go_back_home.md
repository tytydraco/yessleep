“Just stop running already!”, I yelled as I chased the man up the stairs.

I had followed him through a variety of alleys and into some old and most likely abandoned building. On top of that, I had yet to call for backup. Blindly chasing after a suspicious and obviously bleeding mystery person wasn’t exactly what you’d call textbook police work, but I didn’t really care much in the moment. Something about the man’s behavior just didn’t sit right with me. It was obvious there was something going on here, and I wasn’t willing to let him slip away.

I heard a door slam shut from further up above, and had to force myself to slow down. As much as I wanted to rush after the guy, I had no idea who he was, or who he was with. There was no use in blindly rushing into some gang den and getting my head blown off.

As I slowed my pace, I unholstered my weapon and held it out in front of me. I hadn’t noticed it while running, but the stairs groaned heavily beneath me. After briefly allowing myself to look around, I saw the building was in an even worse state than I had thought. Where the hell had this guy led me? Where were we?

When I reached the top of the stairs, I was left with only one way forward. An old, partially damaged wooden door had been slammed shut. I reached for the door handle with my hand, when I heard faint noises coming from somewhere up ahead. My hand froze for a moment as I debated whether I recognized those sounds are not. Were they gunshots? Here? And if so, who were they shooting?

Now my overconfident mood started to slightly dissipate as I reevaluated whether or not I should take the time to call for backup. On the one hand, every second I stood here was another second my suspect had to get the hell away from me. On the other hand, I wasn’t an action hero, and if those sounds really were gunshots, I wasn’t a fan of my chances going in there alone.

Having convinced myself to take the safer option, I took my radio and used it to contact my colleagues. Or, I tried to at least, as no matter what I did, I couldn’t get the radio to give me anything other than static.

“What’s wrong with you?”, I muttered in frustration as I fumbled a bit more with the dials on the handheld radio. As if on cue, the static immediately stopped and the device died. Any further attempts to revive the piece of mechanical incompetence were unsuccessful, and soon I was back to the original dilemma.

Should I continue on, or go all the way back to my car to attempt to contact the station that way. I reminded myself that I wasn’t entirely sure how to get back to my car. It would simply take way too long to get back. Whatever was going on here would be over by the time I would get back.

No, I had to go on.

The door made an awfully loud creaking noise as I slowly opened it. It revealed a long hallway, filled with a variety of garbage and junk scattered about. There were dim lights guiding me through the hall. They didn’t give off much light, but I was more than happy I didn’t have to crawl though the dark.

I could see the hallway split up ahead of me. It branched off to the left and to the right, with a handful of closed doors  on either side. Where did my suspect go? How was I supposed to even find him here?

Suddenly, something collided with me harshly, throwing me against the wall. Before I knew it, I was lying on the ground, my vision blurry and my head ringing. It took me a moment to reorient myself as I looked around. There was someone else there, laying on the ground just in front of me. The figure groaned as he slowly tried to stand up. Seeing the man get up snapped me back to my senses, and I swiftly grabbed my pistol from the ground beside me and forced myself to get on my feet, using the wall as aid.

It wasn’t until I was completely upright and aiming my weapon at my unknown assailant when I recognized him.

“Please man, please”, the man stammered, his voice breaking with almost every next word. “We didn’t know. I didn’t know. I swear man!”

I was still trying to figure out what was going on when the man started crying. My vision had finally completely returned to me, and I saw the man was covered in what appeared to be blood. I tried to determine whether it was his own or not, but the man’s constant begging didn’t make it easy.

“Hey, okay, just calm down-“, I tried to reason with him, but he wouldn’t listen.

“You have to believe me, okay? I’m just a middle man. I didn’t know anything about this. I still don’t! Just, just please don’t,” he stammered before breaking down again. I had absolutely no idea what this guy was on about, but it was clear something had him spooked.

I slowly holstered my weapon in an attempt to gain a semblance of trust to calm him down. I could worry about potentially arresting this guy later, for now I really needed to know what was going on here, and why he was covered in blood.

“Look, just-“

A loud bang interrupted our conversation, making me jump up slightly in surprise. My ears were ringing painfully, but my eyes were focused on the man in front of me. His expression changed instantly, and his head was… it looked like…

His body immediately collapsed onto the ground. My heart was pounding in my throat as I looked at the his face, or at least what was left of it. It was clear he wouldn’t be getting up this time.

This realization forced some semblance of awareness back into me, and I reached for me weapon, but as my gaze shifted upwards I realized it was far too late for that. I was no longer alone.

Two figures dressed in near complete black armour stood before me, keeping large and unfamiliar firearms pointed towards me. I left my weapons holstered, choosing to slowly raise my hands instead. My hands were shaking ever so slightly as the realization started to set in that I really messed up this time. I had no idea who these guys were, but they were way too well equipped for some small time drug dealers. I had to do something, but there weren’t many options on the table. Any sudden movement and I was sure to be shot on the spot, if they weren’t planning to do that anyway.

It seemed like talking to them was just about the only thing I could do.

“Listen-“

“Are you an officer?”, one of the figures interjected. The voice was audible, but also heavily distorted, making it impossible to recognize voices, or even emotions. Their faces were obscured by their helmets and masks, so it was impossible for me to tell what they were looking at, but I imagined my uniform made the answer to their question pretty clear.

It was obvious they weren’t interested in listening to what I had to say, so I took a second to debate my answer. Should I lie? If they were indeed part of some underground organization, chances were they’d execute me on the spot if I said I was a cop. Then again, they did just execute that guy on the spot, and he definitely wasn’t a cop, so maybe these guys were some kind of special forces?

The second figure suddenly straightened their posture, aiming their weapon just a bit more clearly towards my forehead.

“Yes”, I blurted out immediately. “Yes I am. I was chasing… him”, I said, nodding to the body lying on the floor.

There was a moment of agonizing silence before any of them responded. I wasn’t particularly religious, but I’m fairly sure I managed to pray to just about every god I knew in that short moment. I really didn’t want to die. I still had no idea what was going on, but suddenly knowing what was happening here didn’t seem so important anymore.

Then, the two figures simultaneously lowered their weapons, allowing me to finally take a somewhat proper breath. I was still shaking, but my heart slowly calmed a bit, knowing that it wasn’t about to be put down. The second figure turned around, nodding towards something. I took a step forward, and saw another similar figure sitting on the ground, leaning against the wall. From the looks of it, they’d been injured pretty badly.

“Who are you guys?”, I asked silently, almost too afraid to say anything. The first figure simply shook his head ‘no’ in response, before looking at the wounded one.

The second figure had crouched down next to the wounded soldier.

“You alright?”, they asked.

“Yeah”, the wounded man responded. His voice was barely audible, but unlike the others, only barely distorted.

The second figure leaned over the man, checking some kind of device integrated into his suit on top of his right shoulder.

“Injections seemed to have worked”, they eventually decided. “Looks stable. You should be fine.”

The figure still standing next to me nodded before joining in on the conversation and nodding towards me.

“Two, give him your weapon.”

The wounded man raised his head towards us. He didn’t say anything, but even with his mask on it was clear he was questioning the decision.

“Come on, it’ll be fine”, the second figure said as he took Two’s weapon before standing back up. He wandered over to me, but stopped a moment before he handed the weapon over.

“Keep it pointed at the ground. Point it towards us and I’ll make sure you end up like him.”

I was going to nod, but they shoved the weapon into my arms before I could. The other person tapped on my shoulder, before pointing towards themselves. “One.”

Then he pointed towards the person who handed me the weapon. “Three.”

I deduced they were some type of codenames, albeit very unusual ones. I wasn’t entirely sure how they expected me to differentiate the one completely masked anonymous figure from the other, but I didn’t dare to question them at this point.

“Let’s move”, One commanded as he started walking down the hall. Three followed him almost instantaneously, and after shooting the wounded figure one last look, I decided I didn’t have much choice but to follow them.

I followed them into another hallway as my heart skipped a beat. There were multiple bodies lying on the floor in puddles of blood, and the walls were riddled with bullet holes. Whoever had ravaged their way through here had shown absolutely no mercy on these guys.

“Did you guys-?”

“No talking.”

Ok. These guys definitely weren’t looking to socialize. Still, I was following them towards who knew what, while holding an AR. I felt like I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into, and it made me incredibly uncomfortable. Then again, it was also pretty clear I had exactly zero say in the matter, and it felt like they’d shoot me on the spot if I so much as looked at them the wrong way.

They led me into a small room. Up ahead, a double door had been slammed shut, with some strange mechanical contraption attached to it. It didn’t look like anything I’d ever seen before, but I guessed it was some kind of support keeping the doors shut.

One turned towards me, and pushed a small black card into my hand.

“Hold it against this bit here,” he said as he wandered towards the contraption and pointed at what looked like some kind of card reader,” and it will unlock and breach the doors.”

“Don’t get crushed when it does”, Three warned. I couldn’t tell whether it was genuine warning or an attempt to get under my skin. Either way, it definitely worked. The device looked so unnecessarily complex I had no doubt there were more than a few ways for me to get crushed by it.

Why was this here? Clearly these guys installed this thing, as they held the ‘key’. But why? To keep something out? Then why had they gone back my way only to circle back here to open it again?

“When it’s open,” One continued,” arrest everyone inside.”

And with that, One gave me one last tap on my shoulder before he nodded towards Three and walked off into another hallway. I was left with my mouth hanging open from confusion. Where was he going? Did they expect me to arrest whoever was inside all on my own?

“You might have to get loud to get everyone’s attention”, Three said, catching my attention. “Be threatening. Get their undivided attention. All eyes need to be on you, our strong officer.”

The last part was said with so much sarcasm in his voice I could almost taste it. I must’ve reacted in some way, as I swore I could hear some soft chuckling before he too started to walk away, into the opposite direction.

“You’re really going to leave me alone? Where the hell are you going?”

“I’m going to do my job, and that’s all you need to know. I suggest you focus on your part. And perhaps on trying not to get shot, but that part’s optional as far as I’m concerned.”

And with that, he disappeared into the hall. I was left completely alone, having absolutely no clue what to do. I wanted to run, to get the hell out of here. I could just go, the two figures were gone. I could make a run for it, and call for backup. That way I wouldn’t have to rush into who knew what beyond those doors.

But I couldn’t. Something withheld me from leaving. Perhaps part of it was due to my increasingly rising curiosity. Another part was definitely the knowledge that they’d never let me leave. Plus, there was the third man we left bleeding in the hallway. I had no idea how I’d talk myself past him, and he was unlikely to just let me leave after seeing me go in with his partners.

No, none of this was optional. I would either go through with this, or I’d get shot by my temporary allies.

I slowly walked towards the mechanical device. I wondered how it was possible to make a doorstop look so complex and threatening.

Who knew what was on the other side? Perhaps it was nothing. Perhaps it was just a few guys, and I could catch them off guard. Perhaps I was making this out to be much scarier than it actually way.

It was an unlikely scenario, but a nice one.

The card reader beeped loudly as I held the card in front of it, and almost immediately I could hear motors and all kinds of pistons start to work. Some of the arms on the device came loose from the door, and shifted into a different position. Remembering the warning of being crushed, I took a few steps back, mere moments before one of the metal arms swung right past me.

I let out an unwilling yelp as I jumped back a little further. Three wasn’t kidding, there was no way this thing had ever passed any safety tests.

Then, the robotic arms all launched forwards, crashing into and completely shattering the doors. I quickly raised my weapon, and as the arms folded in on themselves to make room for entry, I walked through the doorway.

“Police!”, I yelled as loudly as possible as I stepped into the room. The room was decently sized, with a variety of packages stacked in the middle. I swiftly counted about five guys in the room, all of which had been engrossed with one particular crate. Surprisingly, it didn’t look like they’d been expecting me.

Two of the men were quickest to turn around while reaching for their weapons, but when they saw mine, their hands froze in place. Two more turned around with a vague look of surprise and fear in their eyes. They realized they’d been caught.

“Hands in the air”, I instructed. One of the two armed men slowly raised their arms, but the other kept his hands lingering over his weapon. I turned to point mine directly towards him, locking ourselves into a game of chicken. His stare burned into mine. My heart was racing, and I was silently warning him not to try it. I really didn’t want to have to shoot the guy. It shouldn’t matter, but he still looked so young. Early twenties, at most.

Then, the man relented, and slowly raised his hands. I turned back towards the group, and saw the fifth man still hadn’t faced me, instead, he was staring into one of the crates.

“Hey buddy!”, I yelled. “Turn the hell around! Eyes on me.”

He suddenly jerked his head backwards, as if released by an invisible hand. He slowly started to turn around, momentarily stopping halfway. His gaze was directed at his feet.

“Hey,” I said, remembering Three’s words,” eyes on me.”

The man hesitated for a moment, but then his gaze slowly travelled upwards, until his eyes finally met mine.

Shots thundered throughout the room. Almost simultaneously, I watched all of the men drop to the ground. I jumped as my eyes darted across the room in a hurry to identify where the shots were coming from.

I saw Three and One rushing into the room from a set of doors I hadn’t noticed before, weapons drawn. One walked towards one of the men lying on the ground, and gave him a small kick.

“Dead”, confirmed Three, who was crouched down next to another.

I was still frozen, standing in the entrance. What the hell just happened? They used me.

“What the hell?”, I yelled as I suddenly rushed forward towards Three. “You can’t just execute them! They were surrendering!”

“They got involved in the wrong business, buddy. And now, so have you”, he responded as he raised his weapon towards me.

I was done for. He would pull the trigger, and there was nothing I could do about it.

In situations like this, you’re told your instincts take over, that you’ll either try to run, or that you’ll try to fight your way out.

I did neither. Instead, I was stood completely frozen, as if accepting whatever was going to happen next. I stared right down the barrel, until One put his hand on top of it and pushed it back down.

“We’ll give him a choice”, he mumbled.

“Really?”, Three replied as he lowered his weapon. “You are one lucky guy.”

One turned towards me. He stood there for a moment, making me more uncomfortable with each passing second until he finally spoke.

“A group kidnapped something of ours. They’ve been moving it from smuggling group to group in an attempt to make us lose their trail. These guys were unlucky enough to mess up. We’re here to free it, and take it back.”

‘Kidnapped something?’, I thought to myself. How do you kidnap a thing? Perhaps I’d misheard, or more likely, the man might’ve been a foreigner. That was good, I figured any info I could get on these guys might give me a heads up.

“We’ve got them”, Three suddenly yelled. I noticed he was looking into the open container the smugglers had been staring into.

One swiftly turned around, cautioning Three to be careful while walking up to him. He carefully reached into the box.

My mind was completely overtaken by curiosity. Who was in there? A kidnapping victim? Some CEO’s daughter? Whoever it was, they had to be ridiculously important to warrant this kind of intervention.

A teddy bear.

I closed my eyes in disbelief. There was clearly something wrong with them. I was still pumped with adrenaline and fear. It was a trick of the light. I didn’t see it right.

I opened my eyes, seeing it more clearly this time.

It was a teddy bear. A completely unremarkable toy.

My mind was blank. The situation was so bizarre I simply had no idea what to think.

One turned towards Three as he gently put the teddy bear on a nearby table. “Let’s go get Two’s containment box.” He then nodded towards me. “Instruct him.”

He walked over to me before grabbing my arm and pulling me towards a door. I didn’t resist. There was no use, and I was still shocked by whatever all of this was.

We walked into a small room. He sat me down on a chair before walking back towards the door.

“Listen. You got two options. They both suck.”

Not a great beginning.

“Option one: you come with us. It *is* a lifelong dedication. I can’t tell you anything else myself, but it’s…” he fell silent for a moment. “It’s definitely an experience.”

“Option two”, he muttered, before gently tapping his finger on top of his weapon. No more needed to be said. The message was clear.

“Don’t take too long.”

And with that, he and One walked away, presumably back towards the wounded ‘Two’ we saw earlier. Three had left the door open, leaving me with a direct line of sight towards the table with the teddy bear on top. So much violence and death, it was almost impossible to believe it was all for a simple toy.

The longer I stared at the toy, the more uncomfortable I got. I couldn’t tell if it was because of how many people had been killed for this thing, or because there was something… something…

I saw One and Three walk back into the room. One was holding a large cubical container and walked over towards the teddy bear. He carefully grabbed the toy before securing it inside the container and giving Three a thumbs up.

Three walked towards my room, stopping in the doorway. He stared at me for a moment before nodding. The message was pretty clear.

This was it.

It was time to make a choice. And we all knew what it was going to be.
