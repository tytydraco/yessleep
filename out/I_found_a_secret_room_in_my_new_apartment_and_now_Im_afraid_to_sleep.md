Hi everyone, I'm writing this post because I'm in a situation that's terrifying me and I don't know what to do. A few weeks ago, I moved into a new apartment in the city. It was an older building, but the rent was cheap and it was in a great location, so I jumped at the opportunity.

At first, everything seemed fine. I unpacked my boxes, set up my furniture, and settled in. But then I started to notice some strange things. Every night, I could hear noises coming from the walls. They sounded like whispers, but I couldn't make out what was being said. I figured it was just the building settling, or maybe my neighbors talking, so I tried to ignore it.

But then I found something that I couldn't ignore. One day, I was cleaning out the closet in the spare bedroom when I noticed something odd. There was a section of the wall that sounded hollow when I knocked on it. Curious, I pulled at the wallpaper and discovered a small door. It was almost hidden, but once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it.

I hesitated for a moment before opening the door, but my curiosity got the best of me. What I found inside was like something out of a horror movie. It was a small, dark room with no windows. There was a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling, casting an eerie glow on everything. There was no furniture, but there were strange symbols painted on the walls in what looked like blood.

I was so scared that I didn't even think to take a picture. I just slammed the door shut and ran out of the apartment. I spent the night in a hotel, but now I'm back and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to sleep in my own apartment, but I can't afford to move out. I don't know who to talk to about this or if I should even tell anyone. I'm at a loss and I need help.

The next few nights were some of the worst of my life. I couldn't sleep, constantly thinking about what I had found. I was too scared to tell anyone about it, thinking they might not believe me or even worse, that they would think I was crazy. The whispers in the walls seemed to get louder, and sometimes I thought I could hear scratching sounds coming from the closet.

One day, I decided to do some research on the apartment building. I found out that it was over a hundred years old and that it had a dark history. In the early 1900s, it was used as a boarding house for immigrant workers, and there were rumors of illegal activities taking place in the basement. The more I read, the more convinced I became that there was something sinister going on in my apartment.

I decided to confront the landlord about the secret room. When I showed it to him, he seemed surprised, but he brushed it off as just an old storage room that had been sealed up. He told me that he would have it removed, but he didn't seem very concerned about it.

A few days later, I came home to find that the door to the secret room had been removed. I was relieved, thinking that the room had been taken care of. But that night, the whispers in the walls were louder than ever. I felt like I was being watched, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was in the apartment with me.

I decided to take matters into my own hands. I researched online for ways to protect myself from evil spirits or ghosts. I found a few remedies, such as burning sage or sprinkling salt around the apartment. I tried some of them, but they didn't seem to have any effect. The whispers continued, and I still felt like something was watching me.

One night, I decided to stay up and keep watch. I sat in the living room with all the lights on, trying to stay awake. But eventually, I must have dozed off because I woke up to the sound of someone whispering in my ear.

I jolted awake, my heart pounding in my chest. But when I looked around, there was no one there. I was alone in the apartment, but the whispers continued. I couldn't take it anymore. I packed a bag and left the apartment in the middle of the night.

I stayed with a friend for a few days, trying to figure out what to do. I didn't want to go back to the apartment, but I couldn't afford to move out. Finally, I decided to talk to a psychic.

I found a reputable psychic in the area and made an appointment. When I told her my story, she listened intently, nodding her head. She told me that the apartment was indeed haunted, and that the room I found was used for dark rituals by the previous tenants.

She gave me some advice on how to cleanse the apartment, including burning sage and playing calming music. She also gave me a small vial of holy water to sprinkle around the apartment.

I went back to the apartment, armed with the psychic's advice. I played calming music and burned sage in every room, including the closet where the secret room used to be. I sprinkled holy water around the apartment and said a prayer.

To my surprise, the whispers stopped. The apartment felt lighter, and I no longer felt like I was being watched. I was able to sleep through the night without any disturbances.

Since then, I've been living in the apartment without any issues. I'm still a little nervous, but I feel like I've taken control of the situation. I never would have thought that I would become a believer in the paranormal, but my experience has changed my perspective.

If you're ever in a situation like mine, don't be afraid to seek help. There are people out there who can assist you in dealing with the paranormal, and sometimes a little bit of sage and holy water can go a long way.
