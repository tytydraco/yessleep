A few years ago, I was on a trip to Manhattan island. Being the idiot I am, I left my cash and some of my luggage in a taxi. I was stranded in the middle of New York and I needed to find a hotel quickly. Luckily, there was one right next to where I was. It had a neon sign that said, "The Sorcière Hotel." As I approached it, I immediately knew that something was off.

The hotel was a dingy tourist trap. Everything had some yellowish dirt on it and the walls looked like they hadn't been painted in years. I came up to the receptionist and asked for a room. I was repulsed by his strange smile. He gave me some keys and asked for my credit card. When I gave it to him, he swiped it and handed it back to me. I tried pulling it from his hand but he wouldn't let go. I had to use a good amount of force to grab it back. "I'm sorry, this is my first day." is what he said. He asked, "Can I carry your luggage?" I didn't say anything, but he grabbed it anyways. He was odd, but he wasn't nearly as strange as the rest of the place.

I went to use the elevator, but there was none. I sighed and went up the stairs. When I went to put my hand on the handrail, I noticed that it was coated in some sort of translucent goop. When I finally got to my door, I opened it and noticed that there was a man in my room. I asked, "What are you doing here?" He said, "I'm just checking your room, sir." and left. While he was leaving, I got a detailed glimpse of his facial features. He was a pale man with an almost cartoonishly long face. Unlike the rest of the employees who were smiling, he had a nonchalant expression. I would say that he looked almost depressed.

I jumped onto my bed and noticed that my luggage was already in my room. I thought that this was strange as I didn't see the receptionist come up the stairs with me. At this point, I wanted to leave. I thought, "Just one night." When I put my head on my pillow, I noticed that something was under it. I looked, and it was a dead rat. I was disgusted. I called room service and told them about it. They cleaned it up and I asked where it came from. A man with a large smile on his face said, "Accidents happen. We are sorry." and left. I would have left, but it was 2:00 AM and I didn't have the energy. I was thinking, "This day can't get any worse." It did.

I tried to go to sleep, but I couldn't. This place was just too weird. At about 3:00 AM, my doorbell rang. I looked through the peephole and saw that pale man who was in my room earlier. I opened the door and he said to me, "Hello, I am the owner, Gustavo. I've heard that you found a dead rat under your pillow?" I replied, "Yes. What about it?" He told me, "I'd like to give you some compensation. How about a night for free?" I was about to say something when he left abruptly. What was wrong with these stupid people?

While I was trying to sleep, I could here fighting from the other room. It sounded like two people were trying to kill each other. I could hear loud sounds of somebody being slammed against a wall. After a few minutes of this, I heard intense screaming. I didn't care how tired I was, I was going to leave now. As I went to the door, I saw something through the peephole. It kind of looked like a human but with ten fingers on each hand, rough and colorless skin, and purely white eyes. It's mouth was wide open, exposing its sharp teeth that were covered in blood. I stumbled back and hid under my sheets. That's all I could do at this point.

At around 6:00 AM, I was going to leave this place no matter what. I got out of bed, opened my door, and bolted out. I was running down the stairs when I tripped. Gustavo helped me up and said, "Leaving so soon? You have another night for free!" I escaped his grip and ran to the main lobby. There were at least fifty employees in here and they were all standing in a circle. When I came in, they all looked at me with their freaky smiles. At the same time, they all said, "Leaving so soon? You have another night for free!" They chanted this over and over while I ran out the door.

When I got outside, I felt a sense of relief. I called the police and told them what had happened. They went to check the hotel, but it was gone. In its place was an old apartment building that hadn't been used in decades. If anybody has experience with The Sorcière Hotel, please tell me. We need to uncover this mystery.
