So, to recap, my new boss [spat wasps in my face](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17zp8su/i_just_found_something_nasty_in_my_bosss_bedroom/) then told me that would only be a ‘drop in the ocean’ compared to what *would* happen next if I quit. Call me crazy, but I was beginning to suspect all jobs were shit…

Alone in my room, my mind struggled to explain what happened. After all, only morons believed that voodoo crap.

Sandra probably slipped some pills into that revolting tea. Mix that with a musty house where the bugs acted more like tenants and you had a recipe for a nasty hallucination.

Did I really believe this? Probably not. But either way, you’d couldn’t have dragged me back to Whiteabbey if you’d come armed with a gun and a pair of handcuffs.

“Sandra only needed me for two days,” I told Dad, over a dinner of Lasagna. I promised him I’d go out the next day and ‘knock on doors’ until I landed a new job. Very little else was said before I trudged off to bed.

Early the next morning, my nose went wild with a furious, unstoppable itch. I flexed my nostrils, swatted my face. Still there. Sitting up against the headboard, my eyes crossed, focusing on a huge moth perched on my nose…

I almost fell over scrambling out of bed, the invader suddenly gone. My eyes scanned the bookcase, the computer desk, the Doctor Who poster on the far wall. All clear. With a yawn and a stretch, I shuffled through to the bathroom.

Mid-stream, the sneaky bastard dived-bombed me from behind, wings fluttering. I did a little foxtrot around the toilet bowl, grabbing a toilet brush to swat my attacker away.

In the kitchen, the leftover lasagne called to me from the fridge, so I tossed it in the microwave.

As a forkful of reheated pasta hovered inches away from my mouth, the top layer of cheese writhed around, and then two antenna popped out testing the air, followed by a juicy cockroach.

The fork clattered to the floor, a voice at the back of my mind whispering: *what if this curse stuffs real?*

Swatting the thought aside, I stomped the bug, grabbed a bag of Minstrels, and sat down to play Diablo 4 in my room. Soon I got so focused on the game I didn’t realize I’d grabbed something wet and slimy until it was already too late.

Pinched between my thumb and forefinger there was a fat, brown slug. Or half of one, at least. The rest came up my throat along with a fountain of half-digested chocolate…

Desperate to make my mouth forget that bitter aftertaste, I gurgled Listerine for twenty straight minutes. Afterwards, as I dressed myself, a horsefly living in my sock bit me on the toe and I found three maggots squirming around my hair.

There was no way the bug-tsunami could have been a coincidence. No, this was a ‘fuck you’ from Sandra.

For twenty minutes I anxiously paced around my room, terrified about why she wasn’t answering my calls or texts. If I went back to Whiteabbey, would she turned me into a giant toad? Or make boils grow all over my body?

In the end, I saw no other choice. I needed to do as she asked.

On the way to the marina, I stopped at the florists to buy a bouquet of apology roses. Hopefully, they’d help convince Sandra to call off her minions. Anxiety clawed at the pit of my stomach throughout the entire boat right over to her place.

I marooned the boat on the pebble beach, gave myself a little pep talk, and marched up to the house, getting pelted in the face by wave after wave of gnats and midges.

Over the phone, the old lady had said to let myself in. Beneath the welcome mat, a tangled knot of beetles and worms crawled over each other. I nudged the spare key away from their brawl using my foot.

As the front door creaked open, an awful stench wafted out, worse than the fish market on a baking hot summer’s day.

“Hello?” I whispered, my voice echoing down the hall.

No response. Hunched low, I inched forward.

In the empty kitchen, spiders and emerald beetles scurried across every surface; easy to spot against those nicotine stains. My eye landed on the dining table, where an envelope sat propped up by the ashtray. It had ‘WADE’ scribbled across the front.

I crossed the room and opened the letter. In barely legible handwriting, it said:

*Wade,*

*By the time you read this, I’ll have kicked the bucket. It’s unfortunate, but at my age these things tend to happen. You’ll find me upstairs in bed, second door on the left.*

*It’s getting hard to breathe, so I’ll make this fast. That £3000 is all yours, there’s just one last job I need you to do.*

*I’ve lived my life in service of the forces inhabiting this island, and the deal was always I needed to repay that debt. That jar I asked you to carry up to the cave was meant to be my last instalment. I couldn’t make the journey myself, so I roped you in to help, but then you cheated the island. Now I’ve gotta let my body breakdown up there, so it can provide nourishment.*

*You seem like a nice lad, but you left me no choice other than to take out a little ‘insurance policy’. That was the reason for our kitchen boogey. Already you should have noticed my friends getting cosey, if not, you will soon. It’ll get worse and worse until sundown, and then the funs REALLY gonna start.*

*The only way to break the curse is to carry my body up to that cave. The altars inside. Drop me onto it, spill my blood there, the island will be happy, and the bugs will call a truce.*

*Start off soon in case you get lost. I’m already wearing the lifting straps to make things easier, and there’s a machete and a flashlight in the trunk. That should be everything you need. Complete the ritual, then you’re free to spend my money on lollipops or Pokémon cards or whatever it is you kids are into these days.*

*So long. And best of luck with your A levels.*

My fingers clutched the letter in a death grip. I must have re-read it a thousand times, praying I’d spot a *P.S. Just kidding* scribbled somewhere. This couldn’t be real, could it?

On unsteady legs I climbed the stairs, my back flat against the wall. Closer to the bedroom, even pulling my jacket up over my mouth and nose didn’t help block the stench.

I took a deep breath, held it, and pushed open the creaky door...

A motionless Sandra lay in bed, cocooned inside a grey duvet, her bloated skin alabaster-white. You could barely see the side table beneath a mountain of cigarette buds.

Terrified any sudden movement might have caused her to sit up, I tiptoed towards the bed. And staring down at that dead face, I knew straight away there was zero chance of me carrying out her dying request, curse or no curse.

I grabbed the envelope from my pack. “Look, I’m giving the money back. That makes us even, right? No harm no foul?”

Silence. Forcing myself to lean in closer, I said, “Sandra, I’m really, *really* sorry about what happened, but I can’t…I’ll call somebody. Somebody who can give you a proper burial. That’ll be a much nicer way to go, don’t you think?”

In my mind’s eye, that liquid wheeze of hers echoed on and on, filling the empty space.

“Alright then. Nice meeting you.”

Anxious to get the hell out of there, I lay the envelope on the side table and set the roses across Sandra’s chest.

Three steps toward the door, a low, persistent hum rang out. My eyes darted around the filthy room.

For a moment, the space seemed to shiver, the mattress and curtains and gaps between loose floorboards suddenly alive with movement. Then, flies fatter that jellybeans burst from those hiding spots in a cloud of black cloud that came surging after me, buzzing louder than traffic.

Surrounded, blind, I fought my way toward the door, my hands swatting the space around my skull, killing the horde by the dozens. For every winged bastard that dropped out of the air, three more took its place, until they blotted out the world and roared in my ears.

As flies fought over the best landing spots in my eyes and lips and hair, I went crashing into a wall and fell to the ground.

“ALRIGHT I’LL TAKE THE STUPID BODY,” I screamed, half-choking on a steady diet of winged insects. Straight away the flock dispersed, funnelling back to their nooks and crannies in buzzing columns, the only evidence they were ever there were the corpses blanketing the floor.

I dragged stale gulps of air into my lungs, picked detached wings from my teeth with disgust. What did the letter say again? *At sundown, the funs REALLY gonna start…*

Shit. I needed to reach that altar, fast.

Sandra’s stiff, awkward body made hoisting her up a real chore. Every so often her limbs creaked and groaned, expelling blasts of rancid air which made me gag. Beneath the lifting straps she’d worn sweatpants and a blouse.

Carrying her like a surfboard, I made my way downstairs. Carefully.

At the halfway point, on a crooked step, something crunched beneath my foot. When I flinched, Sandra’s body—frozen in position like a soldier standing to attention—slipped out of my grasp and turned over and over on its way down the steps, where the top of her skull put a dent in the downstairs landing. Harvestmen poured out from the hole, hurrying for cover in a wallop of long, skinny legs.

My mission was off to a great start…

Downstairs, inside the battered trunk, Sandra had stashed away all the gear. Outside, the sun hung low in the grey, mid-afternoon sky.

With the machete fastened around my waist and Sandra strapped onto my back, I set off along the gravel path, flashlight in hand. Even though I planned on being done with the whole mess well before dark, I figured it best to have the torch and not need it, than to need it and not have it. Like dad was so fond of saying…

I ran that first leg of the trail as quickly as I could, but between the brutal incline and all that extra weight, my pace tapered off to a measly jog before the ocean waves had even faded into the distance. You could see ‘Napoleon’s nose’, as Sandra called it, from anywhere on the island, although there was miles of ivy, nettles, and crisscrossed tree limbs to get through first.

The gravel turned to weeds and grass as the trail carried me higher and higher. Soon the sound of water lapping against the shore was replaced by this constant…*writhing*? The sound rang out from behind all the foliage; insects going about their business. This gave me a shot of adrenaline.

I moved quick, back aching, constantly stopping to wipe sweat off my forehead and readjust my passenger, shifting her weight from side-to-side so my leg muscles could get some temporary relief.

The path kept splitting into segments, which meant endless backtracking. Each time screeches and chirps rang out, like invertebrates were singing to me. Or issuing a warning.

Because I became so fixated on driving forward no matter what, dusk rolled along with me barely noticing. But then vague silhouettes started crawling around, out beyond all those moss-covered trunks.

Without slowing down I flicked on the flashlight. Side-stepped ditches, constantly pushed ahead. Whatever spot my torch illuminated, things hide from the light in an instant flurry.

At the far side of a dense cluster of trees, a strap gave out, which made Sandra’s weight shift more toward my lower back. My thighs soon felt like blocks of lead, and there was still another mile between me and the cave. Crap.

Around a bend in the valley, thousands of unfriendly, glowing eyes watched from the shadowy forest. Terrified their owners might have burst out at any second, I became so distracted the loop of an exposed tree root caught my foot off guard.

The flashlight went spinning into the underbrush as the bare skin of my palms ploughed the hard earth. Face down in a shallow ditch, I couldn’t bring myself to stand up straight away. Just a quick breather. Then I’d set off again.

Pressed flat against the ground, deep reverberations rattled my jaw. It felt like leaning my head against the window of a moving bus.

In a single breath, something shot up my trousers, coiling around the back of my knee. Millions of tiny feet stamped their points across the flesh, prickling everywhere.

Oh fuck—it was a centipede, or a millipede, or a whatever-the-fuck-ipede, thicker than a severed arm and headed towards a *very* delicate spot.

Unlatching myself from Sandra, I flopped around in the twigs and pine needles. I sat up hammer-fisting my own thigh until something crunched, and then I leapt to my feet, hopping around like I was having a piss without taking my trousers off first.

A centipede with a squished head slid out of my trouser leg, onto the dirt. When the blood stopped pulsing inside my skull, that awful writhing sound replaced it, and I scrambled to strap Sandra onto my back once again.

The busted straps made it impossible to take more than ten steps without her working herself free from the restraints. As the final slither of sunlight dipped beneath Napoleon’s nose, that *writhing* grew louder and closer. I fumbled for the flashlight and angled it along the descending curve of the trail and saw that, out in the darkness, a semisolid wall that pulsed in a buzzing, biting, poisonous shroud, slinking closer, scuttling out from behind roots, bushes, over and around rocks, like black mist spreading across the ground.

The bugs were closing in fast. Impossibly fast.

Carrying Sandra across the front of my chest, I took off at top speed. If the school rugby coach had seen me barrelling towards the cave just then, he’d have awarded me the team captaincy on the spot.

But as quick as I was, Sandra’s minions were even quicker. Countless legs rolled across the dirt, accompanied by papery wings. It sounded like a heavy rain.

The mouth of the cave appeared before me. Exhausted, breathless, I pushed through the entrance, following a downward slope.

Less than ten steps inside, the ground *reacted* to my weight, almost creating a downward suction. This was quickly replaced by bugs swarming around my feet, thick and mushy. Their insides oozed and squelched underfoot, creating an awful reek.

Enough moonlight shone inside the cavern to make out a crude stone altar, just ahead. Almost there…

Something, roughly the size of an avocado and armed with mandibles sharper than garden shears, tore through the air swooping toward me, colliding with my face. On instinct my hands shot up, letting Sandra drop to the floor.

Trapped on the spot, creepy-crawlies swirled around my ankles, rolling over each other in knotted heaps and tangles, taking sharp bites as they scurried up the inside of my trouser legs, some slimy, some hairy, some encased within armoured shells. They swarmed over me as if the island was about to flood and my body was the arc that might carry them to safety.

The ritual. The only way to stop them was by completing the ritual. I swatted fleas and ants and crickets away by the hundreds, giving myself enough space to move. The urge to mash the bastards with my fists overcame me—to squash them all to paste.

My hands fumbled for Sandra’s body, immediately becoming sticky with pulped thoraxes and abdomens. Beneath these remains, the springy, slippery floor gave way as I pressed down. The way it flexed and stretched out, almost reminded me of…a dentist probing the inside of a patient’s mouth?

Oh fuck. I grabbed Sandra by the torso and hoisted her up, half-falling half-running until my chest slammed against the altar, hard. All air got knocked out of my lungs.

Heart in mouth, I grabbed the machete from its holster. As I did, creatures swallowed my legs, my waist, my chest, most of them armed with stingers and mandibles. If you’d taken a picture right then, you’d have captured a bare hand wrapped around a machete poking out from the top of an insect fountain. Segmented legs coiled inside my ear, ran under my nose like a moustache. Worms wriggled their way towards my mouth, threatening to make their way past my lips until I cut them off at the entry point by biting down. Wait, didn’t that just create more worms?

My first chop clanged against stone, sending shockwaves along my arm and across my shoulder. Meanwhile, bugs burrowed into my flesh. They felt oppressive, like being covered by a thick blanket and tossed inside a furnace. Another few seconds, and I’d either suffocate or overheat inside the mountain of appendages. They’d lay their eggs in my hair and skin and crawl down my throat, and what the island’s next visitor would find would be a skeleton, rotted and filled with brown grubs.

At the next slice, the blade bit deep into flesh, and it was as though I’d power-washed myself with Jungle Formula. In perfect unison, the horde drained away from my body, vanishing into the darkness.

As I lay there, pulse up between my ears, the floor shivered beneath me, the walls and ceiling contracting and expanding. Every surface started secreting this clear, warm liquid, and when the stink of meat gone bad in a rubber bag flooded my nostrils, a demented thought slid into my brain: *what if this is a throat? What if the island itself is gonna DIGEST Sandra?*

I spat out the remains of all the bugs I’d swallowed and clawed my way out there. From the cave’s entrance, I risked a glance back and saw Sandra’s withered husk in the dim light, like an apple eaten right down to the core.

I stumbled over my own feet the whole way down the valley in a mixture of fear and relief, my body covered in puffed bites and scratches, my clothes in tatters. My heart didn’t stop thrashing against my chest until there was fifty metres of water between Whiteabbey and me.

Back home, I stood in the shower for so long Dad pounded on the door and asked if I was ‘filling an Olympic-fucking-pool in there’.

For the next three weeks even the slightest flutter of wings made me shriek, and to this day if I ever see an insect bigger than a testicle—even if it’s just on TV—my body breaks out in a cold sweat.

A few days later, Dad forced me to hand out my C.V. to a dozen or so places. I got a call from the manager of an indoor playpark, who asked whether I’d be okay cleaning bathrooms after children’s parties.

“Some of these kids,” he said, “it’s like they’re fingerpainting in there.”

I told him I could handle anything so long as it [didn’t involve bugs…](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
