I heard the floor creak as it stepped forward, inching ever closer to my concealed hiding space. It had found me. I don’t know if it saw me, smelled me, heard me — all I knew was that I was in danger, a kind of danger that was crude, cold, and inescapable. My nausea ensued as the creaking got louder, making all the bins, books, and insulation surrounding me begin to whirl in impossible ways, distorting into shapes and colors that made no sense. My mind scrambled to process it all, to convince itself that this was all temporary, that this was just some twisted trick my imagination was playing on me.

I tried to convince myself that I would be okay, that someone, something, would reach out their hand and save me. An unrealistic clinging onto faith was all I could conjure in my desperation; it was the only thing keeping my mind from outright deterioration. That desperate, fragile thread of hope was all I had, stretched out so thin it felt like it would snap under my own breath. My nervousness has reached an all time high; I could no longer suppress the inherent shaking as my frantic panting representing the collection of horrid thoughts which composed my mind began to rise through, up, and out of me. I couldn’t stop it — it was as though my instincts had taken over, my rational mind slipping into the background, drowning in fear.

Then there was a bang.

*The shelf got knocked over. It found my hiding space.*

*It found me.*

The indescribable clicking and whirring, like a machine powered with the vocals of some awfully deranged human male, shook me to my core. It was the sound of something both mechanical and alive — something that had no right to exist in either world. I couldn’t see where it was; I refused to look at it. I clamped my eyes shut so tightly I could see bursts of color behind each eyelid, but I couldn’t dare face it. I knew it had finally connected the dots, all those invisible trails that led back to me — back to the one place I had considered safe all this time. That illusion of safety had been shattered the moment it took its first step forward.

It had been seeking me out for what felt like eternity, and now it had finally reached me.

*It was all but over.*

I had so many questions. I didn’t know what I did. I didn’t know why it was looking for me. What made me special? Why was I being targeted? Did I provoke the creature? What even was *the creature*? As a matter of fact, the only recognizably human speech I’ve ever once heard it form was…



It approached me. My eyes were still closed. I couldn’t prepare for what was about to happen — I was forced to accept it. I had no choice. As all the madness reached its conclusion, I let go. *I finally let go…*

*I AM FREE.*  
*I AM FREE AT LAST.*  
*I AM UNTOUCHABLE.*  
*I RECOGNIZE MY TRUE PURPOSE.*  
*I SPEAK THE TRUTH.*  
*I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT.*  
*ALL WHO WITHSTAND THE LIGHT SHALL BE PUNISHED.*  
*I WILL PUNISH THEM.*  
*I WILL ABSOLVE THEM OF THEIR SINS.*  
*THEY WILL KNOW TRUE FREEDOM.*  
*I AM COMING.*
