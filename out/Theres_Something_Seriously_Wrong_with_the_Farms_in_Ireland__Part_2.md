[After the experience that summer](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k701lh/theres_something_seriously_wrong_with_the_farms/), I did what any other twelve-year-old boy would hopefully do. I carried on with my life as best I could. Although I never got over what happened, having to deal with constant nightmares and sleepless nights, through those awkward teenage years... I somehow managed to cope.  

By the time I was a young man, I eventually found my way to university. It was during my university years that I actually met someone – and by someone, I mean a girl. Her name was Lauren, and funnily enough, she was Irish. But thankfully, Lauren was from much farther south than the north-west. We had already been dating for over a year, and things continued to go surprisingly well between us. So well, in fact, Lauren kept insisting that I meet her family back home. 

Ever since that summer in the north-west, I had never again stepped foot on Irish soil. Although I knew the curse, that haunted me for a further ten years was only a regional phenomenon, the idea of stepping back in the country where my experience took place, was far too much for my mind to handle. But Lauren was so excited by the idea, and sooner or later, I knew it was eventually going to happen. So, swallowing my childhood trauma as best I could, we both made plans to visit her family the following summer. 

Unlike the north-west, a remote landscape wedged at the very top of the country, Lauren’s family lived in the midlands, only an hour or two outside the city. Taking a short flight from England, we then make our way off the motorway and onto the country roads, where I was surprised to see how flat everything was, in contrast with the mountainous, rugged land I spent many a childhood summer in. 

Lauren’s family lived in a very small but lovely country village, home to no more than 400 people, and surrounded by many farms, cow fields and a very long stretch of bogland. Like any boyfriend, going to meet their girlfriend's family for the first time, I was very nervous. But because this was my first time back in Ireland for so long, I was more nervous than I would like to have been. 

As it turned out, I had no reason to be so worrisome, as I found Lauren’s family to be nothing but welcoming. Her mum was very warm and comforting – much like my own, and her dad was a polite, old fashioned sort of gent.  

Lauren also had two younger brothers I managed to get along with. They were very into their sports, which we bonded over, and just like Lauren warned me, they couldn’t help but mimic my dull English accent any chance they got. In the back garden, which was basically a small field, Lauren’s brothers even showed me how to play Hurling - which if you’re not familiar with, is kind of like hockey, except you’re free to use your hands. My cousin Grainne did try teaching me once, but being many years out of practice, I did somewhat embarrass myself. If it wasn’t hurling they were teaching me, it was an array of Gaelic slurs. “Póg mo thóin” being the only one I remember. 

A couple of days and vegetarian roasts later, things were going surprisingly smooth. Although Lauren’s family had taken a shine to me – which included their Border Collie, Dexter... my mind still wasn’t at ease. Knowing I was back inside the country where my childhood trauma took place, like most nights since I was twelve, I just couldn’t fall asleep. Staring up at the ceiling through the darkness, I must have remained in that position for hours. By the time the dawn is seeping through the bedroom curtains, I check my phone to realize it is now 5 am. Accepting no sleep is going to come my way, I leave Lauren, sleeping peacefully, to go for an early morning walk along the country roads. 

Quietly leaving the house and front gate, Dexter, the family dog, follows me out onto the cul-de-sac road, as though expecting to come with me. I wasn’t sure if Dexter was allowed to roam out on his own, but seeming as though he was, I let him tag along for company.    

Following the road leading out of the village, I eventually cut down a thin gravel pathway. Passing by the secluded property of a farm, I continue on the gravel path until I then find myself on the outskirts of a bog. Although they do have bogs in the north-west, I had never been on them, and so I took this opportunity to explore something new. Taking to exploring the bog, I then stumble upon a trail that leads me through a man-made forest. It seems as though the further I walk, the more things I discover, because following the very same trail through the forest with Dexter, I then discover a narrow railway line, used for transporting peat, cutting through the artificial trees. Now feeling curious as to where this railway may lead me, I leave the trail to follow along it.  

Stepping over the never-ending rows of wooden planks, I suddenly hear a rustling far out in the trees... Whatever it is, it sounds large, and believing its most likely a deer, I squint my tired eyes through the darkness of the trees to see it. Although the interior is too dark to make out a visible shape, I can still hear the rustling moving closer – which is strange, as if it is a deer, it would most likely keep a safe distance away.  

Whatever it is, a deer probably, Dexter senses the thing is nearby. Letting out a deep, gurgling growl as though sensing danger, Dexter suddenly races into the trees after whatever this was. ‘Dexter! Dexter, come back!’ I shout after him. When my shouts and whistles are met to no avail, I resort to calling him in a more familiar, yet phoney Irish accent, emphasizing the “er”. ‘DextER! DextER!’ Still with no Dexter in sight, I return to whistling for several minutes, fearing I may have lost my girlfriend's family dog. Thankfully enough, for the sake of my relationship with Lauren, Dexter does return, and continuing to follow along the railway line, we’re eventually led out the forest and back onto the exposed bog.  

Checking the time on my phone, I now see it is well after 7 am. Wanting to make my way back to Lauren by now, I choose to continue along the railway hoping it will lead me in the direction of the main country road. While trying to find my way back, Dexter had taken to wandering around the bog looking for smells - when all of a sudden, he starts digging through a section of damp soil. Trying to call Dexter back to the railway, he ignores my yells to keep digging frantically – so frantically, I have to squelch my way through the bog and get him. By the time I get to Dexter, he is still digging obsessively, as though at the bottom of the bog, a savoury bone is waiting for him. Pulling him away without using too much force, I then see he’s dug a surprisingly deep hole – and to my surprise... I realize there’s something down there. 

Fencing Dexter off with my arms, I try and get a better look at whatever is in the hole. Still buried beneath the soil, the object is difficult for me to make out. But then I see what the object is, and when I do... I feel an instant chill of de ja vu enter my body. What is peeking out the bottom of the hole, is a face. A tiny, shrivelled infant face... It’s a baby piglet... A dead baby piglet.  

Its eyes are closed and lifeless, and although it is hard to see under the soil, I knew this piglet had lived no more than a few minutes – because protruding from its face, the round bulge of its tiny snout is barely even noticeable. Believing the piglet was stillborn, I then wonder why it had been buried here. Is this what the farmers here do? They bury their stillborn animals in the bog? How many other baby piglets have been buried here?  

Wanting to quickly forget about this and make my way back to the village, a sudden, instant thought enters my brain... You only saw its head... Feeling my own heart now racing in my chest, my next and only thought is to run far away from this dead thing – even if that meant running all the way to the city and finding the first flight back to the UK... But I can’t. I can’t leave it... I must know. 

Holding back Dexter, I then allow him to continue digging. Scraping more of the soil from the hole, I again pull him away... and that’s when I see it... Staring down into the hole’s crater, I can perfectly distinguish the piglet’s body. Its skin is pink and hairless, covered over four perfectly matching limbs... and on the very end of every single one of those limbs, are five digits each... Ten human fingers... and ten human toes.  

The curse... It’s followed me... 

I want to believe more than anything this is simply my insomnia causing me to hallucinate – a mere manifestation of my childhood trauma. But then in my mind, I once again hear my Uncle Dave’s words, said to me ten years prior. “Don’t you worry, son... They never live.” Overcome by an unbearable fear I have only ever known in my nightmares, I choose to leave the dead piglet, or whatever this was, making my way back along the railway with Dexter, to follow the exact route we came in.  

Returning to the village, I enter through the front gate of the house where Lauren’s dad comes to greet me. ‘We’d been wondering where you two had gotten off to’ he says. Standing there in the driveway, expecting me to answer him, all I can do is simply stare back, speechless, all the while wondering if behind that welcoming exterior, he knew of the dark secret I just discovered. 

‘We... We walked along the bog’ I managed to murmur. As soon as I say this, the smiling, contented face of Lauren’s dad shifts instantly... He knew I’d seen something. Even if I never told him where I’d been, my face would have said it all. 

‘I wouldn’t go back there if I was you...’ Lauren’s dad replies stiffly. ‘That land belongs to the company. They don’t take too well to people trodding across.’ Accepting his words of warning, I nod back to his now inanimate demeanour, before making my way inside the house. 

After breakfast that morning – dry toast with fried mushrooms, but no bacon, I pull Lauren aside in private to confess to her what I had seen. ‘God, babe! You really do look tired. Why don’t you lie down for a couple of hours?’ Barely processing the words she just said, I look sternly at her, ready to tell Lauren everything I know... from when I was a child, and from this very same morning. 

‘Lauren... I know.’ 

‘Know what?’ she simply replies. 

‘Lauren, I know. I know about the curse.’ 

Lauren now pauses on me, appearing slightly startled - but to my own surprise, she then says to me, ‘Have my brothers been messing with you again?’ 

She didn’t know... She had no idea what I was talking about, let alone taking my words seriously. Even if she did know, her face would have instantly told me whether or not she was lying. 

‘Babe, I think you should lie down. You’re starting to worry me now.’ 

‘Lauren, I found something out in the bog this morning – but if I told you what it was, you wouldn’t believe me.’  

I have never seen Lauren look at me this way. She seems not only confused by the words I’m saying, but due to how serious they are, she also appears very concerned. 

‘Well, what? What did you find?’ 

I couldn’t tell her. I knew if I told her in that very moment, she’d look at me like I was mad... But she had a right to know. She grew up here, and she deserved to know the truth as to what really goes on. I was already sure her dad knew - the way he looked at me practically gave it away. Whether Lauren’s mum was also in the know, that was still up for debate. 

‘I’ll show it to you. We’ll go back to the bog this afternoon and you can see it for yourself. But don’t tell your parents – just tell them we’re going for a walk down the road or something.’ 

That afternoon, although I still hadn’t slept, me and Lauren make our way out of the village and towards the bog. I told her to bring Dexter with us, so he could find the scent of the dead piglet - but to my annoyance, Lauren also brought with her a tennis ball for Dexter, and for some reason, a hurling stick to hit it with.  

Reaching the bog, we then trek our way through the man-made forest and onto the railway, eventually leading us to the area Dexter had dug the hole. Searching with Lauren around the bog’s uneven surface, the dead piglet, and even the hole containing it are nowhere in sight. Too busy bothering Lauren to throw the ball for him, Dexter is of no help to us, and without his nose, that piglet was basically a needle in a very damp haystack. Every square metre of the bog looks too similar to the next, and as we continue scavenging, we’re actually moving further away from where the hole should have been. But eventually, I do find it, and the reason it took us so long to do so... was because someone reburied it. 

Taking the hurling stick from Lauren, or what she simply called a hurl, I use it like a spade to re-dig the hole. I keep digging. I dig until the hole was as deep as Dexter had made it. Continuing to shovel to no avail, I eventually make the hole deeper than I remember it being... until I realize, whether I truly accepted it or not... the piglet isn’t here. 

‘No! Shit!’ I exclaim. 

‘What’s wrong?’ Lauren inquires behind me, ‘Can’t you find it?’ 

‘Lauren, it’s gone! It’s not here!’ 

‘What’s gone? God’s sake babe, just tell me what it is we're looking for.’ 

It was no use. Whether it was even here to begin with, the piglet was gone... and I knew I had to tell Lauren the truth, without a single shred of evidence whatsoever. Rising defeatedly to my feet, I turn round to her.  

‘Alright, babes’ I exhale, ‘I’m going to let you in on the truth. But what I found this morning, wasn’t the first time... You remember me telling you about my grandmother’s farm?’  

As I’m about to tell Lauren everything, from start to finish... I then see something in the distance over her shoulder. Staring with fatigued eyes towards the forest, what I see is the silhouette of something, peeking out from behind a tree. Trying to blink the blurriness from my eyes, the silhouette looks no clearer to me, leaving me wondering if what I’m seeing is another person or an animal. Realizing something behind her has my attention, Lauren turns her body round from me – and in no time at all, she also makes out the silhouette, staring from the distance at us both. 

‘What is that?’ she asks.  

Pulling the phone from her pocket, Lauren then uses the camera to zoom in on whatever is watching us – and while I wait for Lauren to confirm what this is through the pixels on her screen, I only grow more and more anxious... Until, breaking the silence around us, Lauren wails out in front of me... 

‘OH MY GOD!’
