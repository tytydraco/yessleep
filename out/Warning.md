For those of you lucky enough to have received this message, I hope this has reached you before it's too late. In the year 2031 our scientists were able to develop time travel in ways we'd never have expected. Obviously this needs to be dumbed down for some people to understand everything. In 2026 a small, fairly new tech company discovered that if they took a group of AI and forced them to learn an abundance of information on a closed loop, the AI would eventually start to learn new things about stuff we thought we knew everything about. It was the advancement humankind needed to move forward. They were able to help establish new technologies, sciences, it helped cure diseases, we found new homes out there in distant galaxy's and were even able to start taking the steps to reach them. By 2029 things like the common cold was something people wouldn't even have to worry about, the world was cleaner and world peace was seemingly just around the corner. To insure this new discovery was kept from being used for nefarious reasons, all data was secured by the government to be controlled and regulated.

  Using the Collaborative AI Technology, CAT for short, we started to meddle with the one thing mankind has never been able to interact with, Time. We found out by shooting a very precise radio wave into a black hole, it reflected back to the earth but at different period in time. Our first tests started small, we sent a string of code to an artists computer sometime in the early 2000s to change a few letters of a children's book title. It worked better than we thought, the AI seemed to be immune to the changes and were able to keep track of what was changed so at least the scientists could understand what had happened. We noticed one minor drawback, at least 15% of the world's population could tell something was wrong. Online forums talking about "Mandela effects" a strange phenomenon where people could swear things were different than they remembered. We continued to do testing moving from media to people, changing names and manipulating life events. but never anything that was too far off of our timeline mainly because we didnt want to be the one's to destroy the space time continuum. 

  Around halfway through the 35th century the Anomalies began. The first recorded Anomaly started when a virus broke out of a lab located in western canada. Upon the arrival of the military, they found an absolute frenzy. People were attacking and eating eachother. All that could be heard was a brutal symphony of blood curdling screams and the sound of flesh being torn and chewed. All hostile entities were put down and seven uninfected personel were exfilled from the site. Six out of the seven personel confessed that they were working on a virus that would manipulate the human brain to crave human flesh. While one man, the leading researcher swears they were a vaccine production lab and nothing malicious could have been going on without his knowledge. 

  We went a few years without signs of any Anomalies. we resumed our tests, we figured it was time for something bigger. if we could send radio waves back in time we came to the conclusion that maybe if we sent a device to the past we could create a stable link through timespace and get better access to the internet in real time, Our government agreed and began building the drones. to achieve breaching the threshold of a black hole, the drones were encased in 12 inch thick tungsten. A black hole would normally be easily able to rip these apart, but our theory was that the black holes work as a door and  vibrating an object at a certain frequency would be the key. After completing the drones they appeared as large mirrored monoliths, something you would see off of a science fiction movie, cold and extraterrestrial. we had four drones for four very specific spots, an American desert, a British beach,a Belgian Field and a Chinese mountain top.

  If somebody is reading this that means our mission was successful. You might be thinking that all of this doesnt sound too bad compared to what we have gained, but im just getting to the warning now. The drones were estimated to reach the black hole three days after launch. We watched eagerly as the first drones slowly passed over the horizon then immediately disappeared. however upon the fourth monolith entering, something else began to emerge. A black distorted copy of the monolith began to crawl out of the hole, besides the pitch black finish, the drone was exactly the same. 

  after 3 days time CAT gave us a set of quardinates, leading us straight to the Black monolith. In its presence it felt like death. This unescapable fear pulling you closer, you wanted to look away but you just couldn't. The AIU were all over the monolith, The Anomoly Investigation Unit was a small branch of military formed shortly after the first Anomoly, consisting of the soldiers and Scientists taken from the site. three people were chosen to touch the monolith, two of the researchers who confessed to making the flesh eating virus and the lead researcher who insisted there was no wrong done. The first one to touch the monolith was hesitant before slowly reaching their hand toward the dark Crystal. As their fingers touch the sounds of snapping bones filled the air. The man started screaming while his body was snapped like twigs on a tree, his skin started to boil into a dark viscous slime. Only after a few minutes the man had become a black puddle, pieces of small bomes poking out in all directions. The lead researcher sobbed to himself begging to be let go. Swiftly an AIU soldier slammed the stock of their rifle into the mans back. He got up and slowly made his way to the monolith. As his hand brushed the dark towering statue, a feral look came over his eyes. He slowly turned around revealing dark almost black eyes. His jaw began to stretch unnaturally revealing rows of jagged teeth, his body becoming a deformed broken shape. The creature looked around before it began to snap its jaws at near by personal. Several nearby AIU began attacking the monster, Using training and special equipment they, the soldiers had the creature subdued in a matter of minutes. Attempts were made to communicate with the anomoly after everything had calmed down, all that we managed to get out of the beast was two statements, the first being "I hunger" followed by "coming home" 

  About 45 minutes ago i recieved a notification from CAT that the connection was established with the other three drones, I grabbed my laptop and proceeded to run to the lab. According to CAT the most frequented website for sharing stories was this one. Heed my warning, the 15% need to be accounted for. DO NOT let them near the monoliths. i think they might be the key to fixing all of this. I have my fingers crossed to hear back from someone to see if this really worked. we dont know the exact date this will be uploaded or how long our drones have been in your time.
