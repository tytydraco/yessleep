It’s been a year since that day. I don’t go out in public much anymore. Too scared I might encounter one of THEM again.   
  
I am glad I stumbled onto this site. I had no idea anyone else had a similar experience to me. Knowing others have seen these, THINGS, has really helped me heal. My family stopped talking to me altogether because of it. They pink slipped me into the hospital for a while but because none of the creatures were there, the doctors insisted I was healed. 



That’s how I know it’s not schizophrenia. No one has subway induced schizophrenia, at least, not that I know of. 

  
But damn. Have I seen some shit. I innocently thought I could take the train at midnight and arrive safely back at my apartment. Instead, I ended up on the long ride home. 



I should preface with the fact that I do not like women. I don’t hate them or anything. I just am not sexually attracted to them. Never have been. I’ve always liked men but my deeply Christian family guilted me out of exploring my sexuality.   
  
Instead I existed in a stagnant world, having been conditioned by conversion therapy to avoid men but also just feeling nothing when I looked at women. My parents sadly believed it would “fix” me into like girls. All it did was teach me to hate myself. 



So my flabbers were ghasted when this short ass blond woman kept looking at me. At first I thought, maybe I’m sitting too straight. So I crossed my legs and shot her a sassy look. She was unphased.   
  
“Bitch do you need something?” I asked, adding a lilt to my voice. I am not very feminine at baseline but sometimes I perform to prevent misunderstanding. 



She didn’t say anything. She merely stood up and walked over to me. She then sat next to me on the subway seat. 



I looked around the empty subway car.  
  
“Girl, are you for real right now? Like you don’t have anywhere else to sit?” I gestured to the open car. 



She watched my mouth move curiously, her lips attempting to do the same.   
  
A deep guttural noise emanated from her throat. “Guuuuuuuuurl” She rasped.   
  
“What the hell. Are you on drugs? Are you a victim of trafficking? Do you want me to call the police?” I searched in my bag for my cell phone. I couldn’t find it.   
  
She watched me curiously and shook her head.   
  
“Are you like, otherly abled? Like are you deaf or something?” I recognize that despite my best efforts, fear doesn’t always make you the most culturally sensitive of a person. This woman was freaking me the fuck out.   
  
The longer I looked at her, the more she just looked, not right. I don’t know how to quite describe it. Kind of how people in upstate describe those weird mother fuckers, those “not deer”. That is how she looked. Like if a person was made of ice cream and left out in the sun too long so her features started melting or blurring or something.   
  
I regretted talking to her at all. Without notice she suddenly grabbed my face, one palm on each cheek and pressed hard. My lips squished into fish lips.   
  
She hissed. “Say it”



“What?” Panic coursed through my body, but despite my best efforts, I could not break free from this tiny 5’4”, 90 lbs when wet woman. How absurd I probably looked, a 6’4” man being forced to do fish lips by this petite frame. Wait a minute, fish lips? I knew this.   
  
“I’m a little fishie” Her face lit up the minute I started talking. “And fishies don’t smile.”  
  
She nodded with encouragement. I continued “but I do”.   
  
She could barely hiss out the next word “ssssssmile”.   
  
I gave my best fishie lipped smile. She did her best to smile in return but all I got was a toothless window into her esophagus. I shuddered and pulled away, blinking back tears of fear from my eyes. She slinked back over to the other side of the car and sat, just watching me.   
  
My mind puzzled as I tried to piece it together. How had she known about fish lips? That was something my little brother and I had done to each other as kids. I stopped doing it after he died.   
  
I blindly searched my bag with my hand for my cellphone as I watched her carefully. Once the subway made the next stop I was getting off and calling the cops. My attempts were fruitless.   
  
“Fuck” I muttered. She cocked her head, like a dog listening. She stood up slowly and pulled something from her pocket. A cellphone. Wait no, MY cellphone. Why did this bitch have my cellphone?   
  
Without looking she opened it and played the video on the screen. It was a recording of me doing the “I’m a little fishie” bit with my brother. I was squeezing his cheeks and he was trying to say the lines but kept bursting into giggles.   
  
She imitated his giggle. It was the most horrifying sound I’ve heard in my life. As if a tub of glass and copper pennies tried to sound like a human. 



At this point, I didn’t even care about my getting my phone back. The minute the subway stopped I jumped from my seat and bolted out the door. I ran up the stairs from the station and out on the street. From the looks of it, I was a few blocks north of central park. I didn’t rest until I reached a bus stop. 



After I boarded the bus, I sat in the front, near the bus driver. I made the mistake of looking in his rear view mirror at the sole passenger on the bus. It was that demonic blond lady with her toothless grin. How the fuck did she catch up with those tiny ass legs? Definitely a drug addict or something with a hyperfixation on me. At this point I felt like I was stuck in a DARE ad.  I got off the bus at the next stop and started running home.   
  
It wasn’t long till after having run in the dark that I ended up in an alleyway. As I turned around, I saw a tiny frame slowly advancing on me. I tried to run past her but with the force of some behemoth she shoved me to the ground violently.   
  
The thud of my skull on the pavement sent electrical shocks down my spine. Please don’t be paralyzed I prayed. This woman was trying to kill me. As I struggled to catch my breath, she slowly untied and removed my left shoe.   
  
“What the hell are you doing? Why are you stealing my shoes?” I tried to kick at her but she grabbed my ankle forcefully. She removed my sock and I balked as she shoved my foot into her toothless mouth.   
  
I kicked furiously but she withstood it as she sucked on my toes. I screamed loudly but at midnight, in the city, no one came to my rescue. As her tongue glided off each toe, she settled on the pinkie toe. With animalistic force she chomped down on it rapidly, using only the bone behind her gums to break through my toe.   
  
I screamed in agony as she severed off my toe. Blood spurt out around her face and on the ground. Satisfied from the toe she had eaten, she slithered away. 



I whimpered and attempted to drag myself. My leg was bleeding and I felt woozy. I tore my shirt and poorly wrapped my foot before I passed out. 

My neighbor found me the next day, lying facedown a few feet from our apartment building door. He called the cops who took me to the ER. After a blood transfusion, some antibiotics and a boot, I was discharged home.   
  
Despite their best efforts, the cops never found the toothless lady. I knew they never would because I still see her, outside my apartment window at night, standing on the fire escape. She is no longer small. She is 6’4” and looks back at me with my face. When it’s quiet I can still hear her through the window repeating her mantra in my voice.   
  
“I’m a little fishie, and fishies don’t smile, but I do.”
