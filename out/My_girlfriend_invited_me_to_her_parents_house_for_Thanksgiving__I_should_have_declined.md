I knew what I signed up for when I started dating Allison.  She was quirky, but that was part of her charm.  That was what I liked about her.  She was unique.  Sexy.  Dangerous. 

“You like that, Danny?  Am I your little raindrop?”  she’d whisper, after licking my face and letting her saliva drizzle down my cheek.  “Microwave’s ready!”  she’d follow with after the hot pockets were done heating up.

What she saw in me, I don’t know.  I was just… me.  Boring office job in software sales.  Studio apartment with only one window and no art on the walls.  A passion for collecting sports cards, specifically building sets, and putting them in albums.  I mean, who wouldn’t enjoy pulling a vintage Larry Bird fresh out of a pack and placing it next to a Spud Webb?  Such a great hobby for a boring man!

Allison worked in a bakery that her parents Stu and Caroline had started while Allison was still just a fetus.  Their specialty was seasonal pumpkin bread that tasted like Fall. 

“So delicious, my little gummy worm, try it.  It’s perfect.”  Allison inserted a piece into my mouth, the crumbs tumbling down my pot belly like men chasing a cheese wheel down a hill.

“Yummy, yummy, says the gummy!” I responded.

“So, next month is our third Thanksgiving together.  And I think it’s time we have it at my parents’ house.  They want to host.  I know you find them a little off-putting to be around.  But they really do adore you.”

I refrained from saying no outright.  She could see I was against the idea.  “Allison, I don’t—”

“We’re going.  No means yes.  And yes means yes.  And gummy will dress to impress.”

After two and a half years of dating, I had gained thirty pounds.  I blamed it on all the tasty treats Allison brought home from work.  I was almost too embarrassed to be seen by her parents, but I loved Allison, so I did as she asked.

“Danny, such a treat.  So great to be able to welcome you into our home for the Holidays,” Caroline said with a twinkle in her eye.

“Delighted to have you here,” Stu said, grabbing my hands with an almost overly powerful grip.

Allison’s parents brought me into the dining room and pulled out a chair for me. 

“Made a special batch of pumpkin break for you tonight!” Allison giggled and slid a piece into my mouth.

Moments later, I blacked out. 

When I woke up, my eyes bulged at the horror on display.  My legs and arms had been tied together with rope.  I was on my belly on the dining room table.  A wet sticky substance like gravy had been poured over my entire body.  A pool of it formed along my sides.

I lifted my chin off the table and directed my eyes to the terrifying scene a foot in front of me.  Allison was in the birthing position, naked.  Legs spread open.

“What is going on—”

“Now now, Danny.  Don’t be afraid.  Tonight, you are going to help break us free from this curse,” I heard Caroline say from behind me.

“Our daughter has been beefing you up all year.  Everything she done has led to this moment.  You are the stuffing to her turkey,” Stu followed with.

And then it happened.

Allison’s babymaker opened wide.  Too wide.  Not human.  Strands of her pubic hair unfurled and slowly stretched out, heading in my direction.  My heart pounded against my chest. 

“Jesus!” I shouted.

I tried to break free from the ropes.  Stu and Caroline gave me a gentle push, and like a box on a conveyor belt, my body glided towards Allison’s opening.

But my heavy weight turned out to be a good thing as the table collapsed just before I entered the darkness.  I was able to get one hand out from the rope and then yanked the rope off my legs.

“No, no, no,” Caroline said.

By the time I was standing up, the transformation had already begun.  Allison and her parents slowly morphed into turkeys.  I bolted out of there without a second look.

When the cops arrived, the family—I mean turkeys—were nowhere to be seen.

A year passed.  Thanksgiving alone, just me, or so I thought.  Three little figures caught my attention from my living room window.  Turkeys.  When I ran outside, they were gone.
