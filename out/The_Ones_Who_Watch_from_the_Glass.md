I’m not writing this because I want to. I’m writing this because if I don’t, you won’t know to stop looking.

The first night it happened, I thought I was overtired. I had just moved into a small upstairs apartment, still surrounded by boxes, no curtains on the windows, barely enough energy to crash on a mattress on the floor. Around 3:12 a.m., my phone lit up on the nightstand.

No buzz, no ping, no notification. Just the screen glowing white in the dark.

I picked it up. Nothing on the screen. Just black. But not quite.

The reflection staring back at me wasn’t mine.

I locked the phone. Put it down. Rolled over. It lit up again. This time the face was closer. Pale, blurred, like someone standing behind glass that was fogged over.

I told myself it was exhaustion. Shadows. Tricks of the brain. But it kept happening.

Every night.

The reflection would shift a little closer. The outlines grew sharper, clearer. Soon it wasn’t just the phone. I caught glimpses of the figure in the microwave door, the blank TV screen, even the sheen of my bedroom window at night.

Always the same face. Always staring.

I covered everything. Towels over the TV, duct tape on the microwave, even aluminum foil across the bathroom mirror. For a week, nothing happened. I thought maybe I’d won.

Until the humming started.

It was low, mechanical, almost like a phone vibrating endlessly against wood. I woke up with the sound rattling through the nightstand. My phone screen was black. I lifted it, but it didn’t turn on. No matter what I did, the glass stayed dark.

That’s when I realized it wasn’t humming from the phone.

It was humming through the glass.

And I could see in the reflection—my bedroom door.

It was open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

Worse, the reflection wasn’t showing me lying in bed. It was showing me standing beside the mattress, staring down at myself.

I dropped the phone and backed against the wall. I didn’t dare look directly at the door. I didn’t dare check if what I saw was real.

The hum grew louder.

It spread to the window. The TV. The tiny square of glass on the smoke detector overhead.

I ran into the hallway, heart pounding. That’s when I heard it again.

Not the hum.

The sound of breathing from the mirror I had covered in foil. The foil bulged outward, stretching like something pressing from the inside.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and slashed it down. The foil ripped. And for the first time, I saw it clearly.

The face wasn’t on the other side.

It was pressed against the inside of the glass.

I don’t remember much after that. I woke up sprawled on the floor hours later, knife still in my hand, the mirror cracked down the middle. No face. No hum. Just silence.

I told myself it was a nightmare. That stress, unpacking, moving—maybe I imagined all of it.

But tonight my phone lit up again. And when I picked it up, I didn’t see my reflection.

I saw yours.

If you’re reading this, don’t check your screen. Don’t look in the microwave. Don’t glance at the dark TV.

They’ve already seen you.

And once they do, they don’t stop.
