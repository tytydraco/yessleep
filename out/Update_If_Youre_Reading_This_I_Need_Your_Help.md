**I wanted to bring everyone up to date—especially for those of you who may have read my original post.

*I don't know where I am.*

This entire room, except for that one blinking red light in the corner, is pitch black. My back leans against a freezing cold wall; my arm is chained to the floor, and I have about three inches to move it. I came to in this condition—disoriented and terrified—seriously, real horror movie material.

They haven't returned for hours. At times, I've heard muffled murmurs punctuated by the odd tread of feet. It seems they are just staying near and waiting for some event to take place; what this is, though, I have no idea. The tension in here is suffocating, and even the slightest creak gives me the creeps.

The weirdest thing? They left me this old-looking black phone that isn't even mine and barely works. Almost everything is blocked—no calls, no texts, no internet—nothing except… Reddit. I don't know whether it was a mistake or some twisted part of a plan, but I somehow managed to log into my account.

And here I am, posting, hoping, praying this will reach someone—anyone. You might wonder why no one else knows about this account; that's entirely my fault. This was my anonymous venting space—my secret little corner of the internet where I thought I could say anything and stay hidden. I only told one person about it: a friend I haven't spoken to in weeks.

**She blocked me ages ago, and even if she remembered this account, she'd never see this.**

None of my friends or family have any clue I use Reddit. At the time, keeping it secret felt like doing the "smart" thing to do *\*face palms\**. Now, it feels like one of my biggest mistakes. What if nobody reads this? What if this lifeline leads nowhere since I kept it hidden?

For now, just someone out there reading this would do. Someone has to know I'm still alive.

The air is faintly chemical-smelling here, and I swear I occasionally hear machinery whirring, way off. Vibrates under my feet—just enough that I imagine this place could be a factory or a warehouse, and the images just flood into my brain of a misspent youth. It's haunting, really; this used to be like my basement back home. Closing my eyes, I can almost picture it.

It's difficult not to reflect on how traumatic this situation is and the memories I've struggled so hard to bury—well, when I was younger, hurt in ways no one should be, that pain seeped into who I am today. I thought I was over it, but with this helpless situation, it feels very familiar. But this time, I need to defend myself. I need to survive.

I don't know if they'll check this phone when they come back. If they do, this post could get me into even more trouble. But if something happens to me… Maybe this post will lead someone to them. That's all I can say for now. I'll post again when I can. If you're reading this, thank you. Please don't let this disappear. ***Share it. Save it. Do whatever you can to make sure someone else sees it.***
