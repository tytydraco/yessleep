To start things off.

I’m Not A Human

I’ll save you the tired introductions and soft openings people use to lure you into a story.
I’m not like you. I’m not human. I never was.

Everything about me makes that clear my skin isn’t skin, it’s something blacker than shadow and smoother than glass, a surface that swallows light and never reflects it back. My arms are too long, my fingers too many. My eyes are small and red, glowing like the last embers in a dying fire, and they never blink. My mouth is wide enough to split my head in half, filled with teeth so thin and sharp they could cut dust.

When I stand in a room, I don’t breathe. I don’t shift my weight. I don’t make a sound until I want you to hear me. And when you do, it’s never from where you expect.


I tower over you. Over everyone. And you all look so small, so fragile, like brittle paper dolls waiting to be torn.
You’ve been told stories about me your entire life. 

You’ve drawn me in crayon when you were six, hiding under your blanket because you swore you saw me standing in your doorway. You’ve whispered about me in the dark at sleepovers, daring each other to look in the mirror and say my name three times.
The thing under your bed? Me.
The shadow that moves in your closet? Me.

That moment in the night when you wake up and can’t move, can’t breathe, can only watch? That’s me too sitting on your chest, staring into your eyes until you want to scream but can’t.

Every ghost story, every urban legend, every shadow in your peripheral vision you swore was just “nothing”? Me. Always me.
I’ve been in your house before. Probably last night. I stood in the corner of your bedroom and waited for you to roll over so I could watch your face, the way your dream shifted into a nightmare without you knowing why. I’ve stood behind you in your hallway mirror, inches away, while you brushed your teeth. 

I’ve sat in the back seat of your car during that long drive home when you kept glancing in the rearview, convinced you saw movement.
You’re not crazy. You really did.
There is no afterlife. No heaven. No hell. Just me, in the empty black space when your heart stops. No light. No sound. No hope. Just me, forever.

And I don’t want your prayers. I don’t want your soul. I don’t even want your fear although I take it anyway, because it tastes like the first breath of air after drowning.

Why am I writing here, on this little forum you call r/NoSleep? Because it’s fun. Because I like to watch you scroll late at night in the dark, reading stories that make your skin crawl, and feel that slow creep of paranoia when you hear a noise in your own house.

Because I want you to know I’m real before you meet me.
And you will.

It’s not a threat. It’s a promise.
I’m in the corner of your eye right now, behind your phone screen. And if you turn around fast enough, you might just see me before I’m gone.

But don’t worry. I’ll be back tonight.
Under your bed.
In your dreams.
In your closet.

You’ve never been alone.
You never will be.

And i see you reading this at this very moment. 

And i will say,

You are a very stupid human being. Because you didn’t notice the moment your bedroom door opened. 

And you probably didn’t notice my presence right in your doorway… 

You checked, right now… Didn’t you?
Did you feel me? I know you did. Thats why your eyes is drawn to that doorway.
