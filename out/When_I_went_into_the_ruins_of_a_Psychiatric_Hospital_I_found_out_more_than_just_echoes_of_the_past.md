Ever experienced so weird that you feel like you're living in a strange movie? That's what happened to me at the old Elkwood Psychiatric Hospital. I love diving into creepy, abandoned places - it's like stepping into a movie set of a horror film.  
When I visited Elkwood, an enormous, long-abandoned building set in the woods, it felt chilly in a strange sort of way. Think about abandoned buildings like time capsules as each place brings with it a slice of history to be discovered. I was excited but also anxious as I stepped inside Elkwood armed with my camera.  
Being inside Elkwood felt like wandering in a maze marked by decay and silence. The deserted corridors echoed with quiet whispers of the past, that I was determined to unveil. Tucked away in a dusty corner of the hospital, I came across an old diary.  
The diary belonged to a girl named Eliza. Quickly, I discovered it wasn't a usual hospital record but the personal diary of Eliza, revealing her painful life story and her tragic end in the 1920s at Elkwood.  
As I read her diary, it felt like I was being drawn into her world, a world filled with despair and a sad ending. Despite the upsetting nature of her accounts, it felt as though I was unfolding Elkwood's spine-chilling history.  I was so intrigued by the diary that I wanted to learn more about Eliza and her experiences.  
Over the next few days, I became fixated on Eliza's diary. Each entry felt like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, painting a haunting picture of her life. Her descriptions gave the tale a realistic touch, making it seem as if she was sitting right beside me, narrating her scary tale.  
Eliza was an optimistic girl when she arrived at Elkwood, hopeful for a cure. But her initial optimism started to diminish because the treatments were harsh and caused pain. She also wrote about her sleepless nights, echoing screams in the corridors, and the fear that was her constant companion.   
Each visit to Elkwood became a mission to discover more about Eliza and the spooky secrets hidden within the hospital walls. I explored every inch, guided by Eliza's diary, in hopes of unearthing more about her life and Elkwood's horrifying secrets.   
A recurring theme in Eliza's diary was the East Wing of the hospital. This part of the hospital was different. The atmosphere felt denser as if the silent tales of the past were trapped within the air. There was a room at the end of the corridor in the East Wing, which scared Eliza the most, drawing me further into the East Wing's eerie premises.  
Opening the door to this room was a chilling experience. The room was almost empty, filled only with a rusty bed frame and a decrepit chair. But what instilled fear in me was not what I saw, but rather what I felt.   
It felt like Eliza was there with me, her desperation, her fright, as well as the horror from her last moments in Elkwood consuming me. Exiting the room, I realized I was not the same person anymore. Encountering the grim history of Elkwood had altered me. I wasn't just fascinated by dilapidated buildings anymore.  
I was the keeper of a dreadful part of history. Elkwood's secret was my secret now. It was a haunting encounter I was unlikely to forget. Reading Eliza's tale and unearthing Elkwood's secrets led me to uncover the dark past of the hospital and sent me on a quest for truth.  
I unpacked Elkwood's notorious history, with reports of unethical treatments, unexplained deaths, and an eventual shutdown. Nestled in the medical reports was a brief note on Eliza's 'tragic incident.'  
Despite my curiosity being satisfied, Eliza's story, the room she wrote about in her diary - all of it followed me. It became a part of my dreams, filled my thoughts during the day, and the eerie silence everywhere seemed to echo her story.  
This newfound obsession led me back to Elkwood, back to that spooky room. Ready with my camera and notes, I stepped back into the horrifying past, preparing myself for a new, chilling chapter.  
I stood before the same eerie room in the East Wing, and as I entered, my flashlight caught something on the wall next to the bed. Hidden beneath layers of grime and peeling paint were a few words scratched into the wall: "Don't trust the whispers." It was in Eliza's handwriting. She was warning me.  
And that's when I heard it, a whisper, so faint it could barely be heard. It grew louder, "Stay... with... us..." A cold shiver ran down my spine. The room seemed to close in around me, the whispers grew louder, echoing my fears. I rushed out as the whisper continued to echo, haunting me.  
Days have passed since my last visit, but the whispers haven't left me. They're always there, just audible enough for me to notice, a haunting reminder of Elkwood's secrets. I don't know what they want from me, but I'm convinced my journey with Elkwood is far from over. I'm not sure what's ahead but I'm ready.  
Despite trying to continue with my daily routine, Elkwood's memory, Eliza's tale, the whispers in that room, seem to haunt my dreams. I decided to put down everything I've learned so far into a document to make sense of my chilling experiences.  
After a long night of writing and probing, I realized that the whispers, Elkwood's horror, Eliza's sad fate, weren't meant to scare me, they were seeking help. A plea to have their story heard and remembered. I understood what I had to do. I needed to share their tale, ensuring the memory of their suffering gets passed on.  
Lastly, next time you come across a seemingly spooky, deserted building, think about its history. The stories it could be holding. The whispers you might hear. And remember Elkwood, remember Eliza. After all, the whispers won't ever let me forget.
