Yeah.  I don’t think it’s a healing spring, or a hot spring for that matter. I don’t know what the fuck it was. 



So, I recently wanted to take a solo road trip to Joshua Tree, California.  I’ve done many solo hikes on my own in the Southern California area from Runyon Canyon, to Eaton Canyon, to some hikes out in Altadena which is kind of a drive for me. 



Hiking is the only thing that calms my anxiety down, I haven’t had a panic attack in years due to regular hiking.  I’ve been to Joshua Tree with the expectation to check out the national park there, but I end up getting caught enjoying bars in the city, thrift shopping and exploring trails in the immediate area. 



I was finishing up browsing one of the vintage shops, contemplating buying a June beetle that was preserved in resin when a young woman pushed a flyer in my face with a monastery on the front, with a photo of a spa inside. It said ‘must-see attraction, and healing spring in Joshua Tree,’ on the front in bold brown letters. When I looked up, the young woman was gone, I assumed to peddling her flyers to other unsuspecting customers. 



I nearly forgot about the hot spring attraction, until I dug through my bag to make sure I had my car keys, my fingers brushed up on the flyer I stuffed in there. I decided to check the reviews for the hot spring before bed. It didn’t have any photos, and only a few reviews. Most of the reviews were short phrases, with no capitalization and poor grammar saying ‘the spring was nice,’ ‘would recommend’, ‘cool’.  At the time, I didn’t think much of it, because there were plenty of places that had no reviews, or even terrible reviews that I’d been to before and never had an issue with, but this time was different. 



I went to the hot spring at the monastery the next day after a short hike in the area. It was a drive outside of the main city. It was indeed a monastery, never noticed it before. It was quite small and it seemed there was a visitor area, clearly marked and an area where the nuns that lived there would have for themselves. I entered through the visitor side, pushing through some old wooden door. 



There was a nun in a dark brown habit that didn’t seem super interested in me when I entered the visitor side. She briefly looked up almost as if she was annoyed to see me there, and pointed to the signs on the desk in front of her.   There was a big sign on the desk that said ‘sign in here, self-serve towels, pick your hot spring bath, feel free to ask questions if you have any’ with a big smiley face. 



There was a receptacle to pay so it was pretty human interaction free. I’m not a super talkative person if I don’t have to, so it worked out. I just picked up my towels and went into the baths. I was the only person there that I noticed.  Each of the baths were private, instead of one big shared one.  All the other ones were out of order, except bath number 6.  



I went, it was nice.  The floors were tiled terracotta, there was a shower to rinse off before going into the hot spring area.  It was smaller than I expected, but perfect for one.  I felt my body relax in the baths. I guess I fell asleep because when I woke up it was dark as hell.  I pulled myself out of the water, my fingers were pruny, I felt like my feet were pruned as well. I looked at my watch that I had left on the edge of the spring and saw that it was 7PM. 



How did I stay here so long, and why didn’t anyone come check on me? I was startled by being in this place by myself so quietly for so long.  I put my hand on my chest, a way I typically calmed myself down when I was feeling panicked.  I hissed in discomfort, there were welts on my chest as if I was scratching myself.  My skin wasn’t cut open, but was I scratching myself? I didn’t feel itchy, and there were no mirrors in the area, but I just wanted to get out as soon as possible. It was too quiet, too dark. I felt my mind trying to play tricks on me, was there something in the corner of the dark bath? There were too few candles lit in the visitor area, and the few golden lights that were on were far between, so I walked in shadow for some seconds in between the lights. 



I gathered my stuff, took a quick shower to rinse off and got out of there. I swear someone was watching me, but I know that wasn’t true because when I checked the sign in sheet I was the only name there for the day.  The woman left the reception and there was a closed sign that was placed in front. It seemed like nobody was even there.  A few lights were in the monastery but it was an unnatural feeling. My car was the only one in the lot, and I’m not gonna lie as eerie as that was, the stars that night were bright and beautiful I remember pulling out of the drive way, but I think I was telling that to myself to avoid the thoughts of dead silent and eerie quiet monastery was, and the fact that I was farther from the city. 



I looked in the mirror of the car, and saw that I did indeed have some raised skin. I have a condition called dermatographia, which means that someone could scratch the alphabet on my skin with a pencil and I’d be raised welts where they scratched it. It looked like someone had scratched cryptic lettering on my chest, symbols I’d never seen before and lines I didn’t recognize in any human language. I couldn’t make it out but it looked like some shit from a horror movie.  I went to dig my hand in my handbag on the passenger seat to pull out some Benadryl cream that I kept on me, and rubbed it on my chest angrily.  I didn’t want to see that on my chest. I felt violated, like who the fuck did this? At a monastery? 



I decided to google the closest police station as a detour to make a police report. It was only 15 minutes away from where I was on the road.



I continued on the road and my eyes couldn’t help but look at the stars - and for some reason, I felt like the stars were watching me, something felt menacing about the night air.  



It was dark as hell in Joshua Tree and the roads didn’t have any street lights, the only lights that were out there were the ones of my headlights and the stars.  Flanking my car was desert, Joshua trees and cactus. I couldn't see anything because it was pitch black, just the varying shadows of the cacti and rocks as I drove. 



All I heard was the engine revving as I pressed the gas, and my breathing, occasionally muttering to myself. So I turned the radio on, and connected my Bluetooth to play some of my favorite songs.  It helped a little bit, but I swear whenever I looked straight ahead on the road I saw something in my peripheral vision.  It was like something was running next to my car on both sides of me but when I turned to look there was nothing there. I turned the music down, because maybe that would help. I looked straight ahead, in silence and there it was again, some darkness flanking the car to the left and to the right.  I looked at the rearview mirror and maybe I saw some more of that darkness that just felt wrong but I could only see it when I was focusing on the road.  It sent shivers down my spine. 



I finally made it to the police station, and there were two police officers there chatting away, smiling and doing their night shift thing I guess. I opened the door and asked to make a police report, one of the officers looked at my chest and he immediately stopped joking with his colleague and led me into a private room. 



He asked me several questions about where I was from, if I was with anyone, and what I was doing to get the marks on my chest.  I put my hands on my chest, and felt the welts there, they felt smaller, they were probably fading due to the Benadryl cream. The officer kept eyeing the marks on my chest, different emotions flitting across his face as he took down my story.  His eyes moved from his notepad, to my face to my chest, all throughout.  It was a little unnerving. He acted quite surprised and questioned me thoroughly about the monastery. He asked if there was anyone to greet me, how long I was in the hot springs, and if I would recommend the springs. I thought that was weird, but I guess he was trying to lighten the mood. 



Finally, at the end he gave me his business card and told me to call him if there was anything else suspicious I forgot to note. 



I left the police station feeling a little better. But as I walked to my car, again the only car in the lot and as I walked away from the glow of the police station lights I couldn’t help but feel like there was a protective forcefield around the station, and that whatever was out the the dark desert couldn't wait to get its hands on me once I left the glow of the building. 



I got into my car, and clicked the locking mechanism twice for good measure. I punched in my GPS how far it would take me to get into the AirBnB, it said 35 minutes.



I looked around and realized the police station wasn’t around much and I remembered seeing something in my peripheral view when I drove off the lot. I hoped to God it was just my imagination as I went back onto the straight and silent road. 



I felt something watching me from the desert. I pressed the lock on my door, yet again and checked the rearview mirror, nothing. When the police station became a dot in the rearview mirror I heard what sounded like very quite galloping on the desert sand, and saw something dark in my peripheral vision on both sides. Shit, was that thing back?   I looked at my chest in the rearview mirror and the scribbles hadn’t disappeared, in fact it looked like they got worse. 



My knuckles were white on the steering wheel, I didn’t want to peel my eyes from the road.  The engine revved louder as I pressed my foot down on the gas, and in turn it seemed like the galloping sound grew louder, like there were horse hooves around my car.  The darkness in my periphery seemed so close, like it was wanting to press on the glass of the car.  I knew I shouldn’t look, but I wanted to because I felt like whatever it was was looking at me.  So I prepared myself. 



I took a deep breath in and dared to look at the window of my driver's side.



I saw a face pressed to the glass.  It regarded me like it was hungry, its face was greyish, it had no lips covering its teeth, and its papillated tongue smeared itself on the glass like it was trying to get a sense of how I tasted.  My eyes followed the creature and saw that its entire body seemed to span the perimeter of the of the car, and it seemed like horse legs were galloping on the passenger side that connected to the creature like a snake.  



My eyes flicked to the rear view mirror and I saw two more faces grow from the black body, and heard a soft thud as it pressed its faces to the windows, cupping their hands around the face as if it could help them seem better into the car, to see me. The fingernails that cupped their faces and pressed into the window were thick yellow and curled. 



I turned to look at the passenger side view mirror and I saw what was making the galloping sound.  It’s feet. They weren’t hooves, like I thought they were.  They were multiple types of various color, shaped, and sized human feet. I saw what looked like dark toned flesh, one foot had an anklet, two were facing the wrong direction. The feet all had horseshoes nailed onto them.  Too many toes, too many feet, steel stapled to human flesh, and galloping to keep up with my car.  



I was hyperventilating and pressed my foot on the gas, going up to 90 mph, and thank God after a few minutes of that I lost the creature.  My throat was hurting, and I didn’t realize that I was screaming the entire time.  I saw the creature’s grey face disappear in the rearview mirror after a few moments, it seemed to have not been able to keep up, and I swear it looked like it stopped in the middle of the road, at least I hoped so.  



My GPS said I was only 5 minutes home, and I picked up my phone and saw I finally had service again. I called my best friend and she stayed on the phone with me for the rest of the car trip, until I safely got into my house, made sure all the windows and doors were locked and I went to sleep. 



The next day I woke up, nothing was disturbed in my AirBnB but I wasn’t staying to figure out a hike, or even to check out that national park. I was going to head home in the daylight as soon as possible. Before I left  I wanted to do some more research on the monastery.  



I typed in the Google search for ‘healing springs monastery in Joshua Tree’ like I did when I first did a search, but nothing came up.  I narrowed my eyes and went back to find the link in my search history and clicked it, and the page was gone. I went to Google Maps and typed in the address that I went to for the healing springs and saw the Google view was a burnt-down monastery.  But that couldn’t be right, because it was fully functional when I was there. 



That freaked me out, because why wouldn’t the police say anything if I told them I was at the monastery? I pulled the card from my bag and called the phone number of the officer that I spoke to the other night. It rang several times, and someone on the line finally picked up.  



“Hello?” I asked. “Is this the officer I spoke to last night? I’m the person that made the police report last night?”

I heard heavy breathing on the other line, but nobody said anything. 



“Hello?” 



There was a squeak on the other line like someone hyperventilating, then I heard almost a tinny version of my voice on the other line. “Is this the office I spoke to last night? I’m the person that made the police report–” I hung up, in a cold sweat. I felt dizzy and the room started to swim.  



“No, not a panic attack, no no no no–” I said as my vision started to blur and my heart rate started to increase.  I felt like something terrible was coming. I heard myself hyperventilating, I put my hands on my chest to calm myself down but it wasn’t working and the lightheadedness just got worse. The last thing I saw before I passed out was the soft pillow on the couch because I had the sense to sit down instead of standing and hitting the hardwood floor. 



When I came it was dark outside again. My chest hurt from all the pounding my heart had been doing over the last several hours. It was midnight. How did I sleep so long? I picked up my phone and saw my reflection on the screen before it turned, my chest had those scratches on it again. 



I’m typing this from my laptop, trying to research that monastery, my best friend is on the phone with me thank goodness. 



UPDATE: 



I hear galloping outside.
