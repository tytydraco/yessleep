I'd like to say there comes a time in every young man's life that he finds himself in my situation but I don't think many are going to be able to relate to me on this. 

He said that all I had to do was drive a few miles with a delivery for him. I wasn't to ask him what it was or to view the contents of what two slightly intimidating eastern European men loaded into the boot of my car. All I knew is that it made the chassis dip significantly when they put it down. 

I was told I was to get to my destination before dawn and that I wasn't to stop for anything. If the road was out, go around. If I got stopped by the police? Well, they told me that wouldn't be a problem. 

I'd maintained a squeaky clean licence apart from a minor speed infraction. Ninety five pounds and three hours of my life later and I was a stand up citizen fully educated on the benefits of the UK smart motorway system. So I figured the police wouldn't have a reason to bother me anyway. 

I mounted my phone onto my dashboard and punched in the postcode they had given me. The destination was around six hours away. Some small village in Scotland. I'd done a similar drive before on my honeymoon to Stirling before so I figured it would be easy. 

Of course my wife didn't know what I was doing tonight. To her I was doing a last minute night shift that had been sprung on me by my job. I hated lying to her. But this was for her, for us even. I was set to pocket ten grand for one night of driving. I figured this was most likely drugs. I didn't care, I wanted to make the best life for us. 

Looking back I'm not regretful that I took this job but I should have realised from the circumstances of the offer that it wouldn't be something so benign as a street pharmacist’s supply run. 

I was about fifty miles into the journey just out past Birmingham that I started to think about how the offer came about. I had a regular guest stay at the hotel I worked at. He was a peculiar guy. For the sake of anonymity we will call him Mr Edwards. No particular reason. It's just a simple name. 

Mr Edwards approached me on a particularly quiet evening to chat about the usual bluster of our small town. What places were having events, what shows were on at the theatre. Our topic of conversation always boiled down to that. Turns out having the world's most famous playwright as your town's claim to fame makes it all anyone talks about. 

After he had finished telling me about the latest production of Hamlet that was set on a ship for some reason, his demeanor changed and he spoke to me in a lowered tone. 

“You ever wonder how I can afford to stay here so much? How I see all these shows. I got the best seats you know?”

Mr Edwards wrapped his fingers on the polished wood front desk and smiled at me eagerly. Given my history of social anxiety I couldn't look back at him and pretended to be typing up an email on my computer 

“Well sir, i just kinda thought you had a good position at a big company before you retired and you are living off a big pension and assets.” 

He shook as his antiquated lungs made his chest convulse as he half laughed half coughed ending in him slamming his wrinkled palm down 

“No, my boy. I've never retired.” He straightened his jacket and looked at me again with his milky white eyes. His cataracts had gotten so thick I wouldn't be surprised if the actors on stage were just coloured splotches in his vision. 

“Though I do grow tired of my position. Someone will be replacing me in a few weeks.” I managed to muster up the bravery to look at him after he spoke. There was genuine sadness in his face. Like he loved his profession so much that he was scared to let go. 

“I'm sorry to hear that sir. If anything it will give you more time to see shows.” My attempt at a bright side had done little to ease the old man's sorrow. Mr Edwards seemed frailer in that moment than I had ever seen him. Like looking at a more decrepit Monty Burns. 

“It makes me feel so young. My job. I don't want to be one of those octogenarians that just sit in a chair to die. But I can't do this last one.” Edward sighed as he leaned on his walking stick. 

“Well I don't know if there is but if there is anything I can do to help make things better for you during your visits I will.” 

There it was. One of the most casually said offers I had ever thrown out. When his face lit up and he beamed a huge smile I grimaced as his leather like skin drew taught over his boney visage. 

“I have an offer. You do one thing for me to help with my job. I will give you ten grand in cash. Just don't tell those thieves at HMRC ay?” 

His body shook again violently as his laughter sent him into a coughing fit. I had hoped I wouldn't have to use my first aid training. I didn't like the idea of mouth to mouth on him. 

I weighed the options in my mind. Whilst ten grand in this economy wouldn't hurt it wouldn't be life changing money. It would help me and my wife move into a different rental house in a better area. We had been wanting kids and this could really help with that. 

“What is it you do sir?” I had to wait until Mr Edwards had pulled himself out of his coughing fit before I got an answer. One of the barmen came to the lobby to check everything was ok but when they saw that it was Mr Edwards they shot me a knowing look and swiftly turned heel, afraid to get caught in conversation with him.

“Every week I do a drive to a small town in Scotland and back. That's all.” 

Really? That was it? All Mr Edwards had done his entire working life was a drive up and down the country and somehow he was flush with wealth? 

“Mr Edwards, are you a drug mule?” 

That was the only explanation I could see for this. Like that Clint Eastwood movie. Choose the most unassuming guy for the job. Yet again Mr Edwards shrivelled form convulsed in laughter and hacking coughs. 

“No my boy but I do transport something. I've seen that you have a vehicle of your own from when you have come and gone from this place. Do this for me and you would make an old man very happy” 

My attention was drawn back to the road as my car dashboard flashed an alert “remember to take breaks” with a little animated steaming coffee cup. It mocked me with its jovial tone but from this I knew I had been on the road for three hours. The funny thing was I don't remember much of it at all. 

I took a sip of the energy drink in my cup holder and shuffled in my seat to try and ease some of the stiffness in my right leg. These drinks barely touched me anymore. In no other word I had been addicted since college. I'd finish one and then reach into my bag and crack another. 

I had swapped them for another vice for a number of years once I turned eighteen. Since beating that I had returned to my old habit once more. Funny, sometimes the whiskey still called to me when I'd pass it in the hotel bar. 

“You are a disgrace” 

I slammed on the breaks almost loosing control as the tires squealed on the empty motorway. I had been listening to a podcast on my car's speakers but this voice was different from the hosts. One host held a southern drawl that the other mocked incessantly but this voice was neither of them. 

I looked around the back seat and saw no one. I rewound the podcast to see if it had been some sort of joke jumpscare but all I heard was one host making fun of the others' large lips. I got out and turned on my phone light as I walked around the car to its rear 

The bulb in my car's boot had been broken for years. It was like staring into a black void on that empty road. I shone my phones light in to reveal a half empty bottle of oil, the dregs of a bottle of coolant and a small wooden box that sat exactly in the middle. 

As I reached my hand out to touch it my phone chimed

 “Get back in the car” 

The message blazed across the screen of my phone causing me to blink a few times to be able to see it properly. Figures whoever had Mr Edwards moving this thing would have some way of tracking it. They must have known I'd stopped. 

Looking for it now I can't find that message in any of my texts or apps. This was the push I needed to just get this over with. I had another couple of hours to go and I just wanted to get paid and forget this whole thing. 

I accelerated with a fury and speed that I had not driven with since I last saw my father. We were at a dinner for my step mother and I was having a very bad time mentally. I had taken a second to get some air outside and he came out shouting and yelling like usual. 

I let him have it. I told him what I thought of him and how he had been as a father. I let him see every physical and emotional scar he had left me with. He had pretended to be a better man with his new wife but I knew what he really was. 

“The thing that's the most fucked up is that you won't acknowledge what you have done! You have created this new personality and acted like what you did to me didn't happen” 

I saw the break in his facade when I spoke those words to him. For the first time his new wife and those he had sold a lie to saw what I saw when he struck me that night. 

“You are a disgrace” 

Those were the last words he had ever said to me. I grabbed my jacket from the bench it lay on and I drove out of there so fast my car flung stones from the parking lot into the air. I don't remember how long I drove around that night. I just remembered finding myself at a service station a hundred miles away when the sun came up.

I saw the blue and white sign coming up ahead and chuckled to myself as I mimed the sound of bagpipes with the corner of my mouth. I'd always loved Scotland. Me and my wife had first come up here just before we got engaged. 

I was hit with a wave of overwhelming nostalgia as I remember gliding down the motorways in her little Toyota whilst we listened to a playlist of songs from outdated memes. I always tormented her with the over nine minute long “bury the light” she still gets set off when she sees “Casey Edwards” show up on the cars screen

The air B and B we had stayed in was nothing more than a shack on a rock they called an island that was infested with mould. The owner's daughter was quite casual about the fact that you had to put your head inside the gas oven with a lighter to get it on. It had a hot tub though. We made good use of that under the stars……

The wide motorways gave way to one lane roads in the last hour of my journey. I had to slow my pace significantly as the fog that rolled off of the mountains had coated the road in a deep veil. It came to a point that I only knew a corner was coming because of the GPS on my phone. I was flying blind.

“I'm sorry Sam but we are gonna have to call your mother about this” 

Why was I hearing that? Why now? I hadn't been in high school in over ten years. The threat of a call to my mother had lost its sting a lifetime ago so why did I feel the fear I felt as a young boy covered in cuts and bruises sat in the councillors office? 

“What you need to understand son is that it's all bullshit. Everything you see here is bullshit.” 

The ramblings of my father's drunken friend at his wedding as I a ten year old boy sat terrified trapped in a booth between him and my passed out father as the party winded down. 

“You stupid boy!” 

I felt the burn of a swift slap on my cheek from my mother. I had been left at home during a family trip with her new boyfriend and I had eaten a whole multipack of hula hoops because seven year old me didn't know how to properly feed himself

“Hello chick. It's good to see you again” 

I looked into the fog as a kind face appeared in its ghostly vapours 

“Those kids at school were horrible to you again weren't they?” 

I felt the wind rush against my face as I swung back and forth and back and forth trading a view between the soft plastic ground and the open blue sky. I breathed deep as I took in the clear air and looked forward during my swing to see her standing at the gate across the field.

She waved me inside as her old brown dog ran out of the gate towards me. I leapt off the swing in a big finish. Stumbling as I fell to my knee but I got right back up. I ran as fast as my little legs could carry me across the bright green grass 

The dog looped around me twice as she had always done before racing me back to the gate. I wasn't gonna let her win this time. I've got this. I can beat her to the gate. I ran arms outstretched in front of me as I reached up to the hand offered to me. 

“Hey! Are you listening to me?” 

The boot of my car slammed shut as the man at my window knocked again. I cautiously rolled it down. 

“You made good time. Here this is what you’re owed” 

He handed me an open brown envelope. I could see king Charles scowling back at me inside.

“We are gonna fill up your tank and then you are gonna head home ok? Mr Edwards is grateful for your help. We will let him know.” 

The drive home was entirely uneventful. No more nostalgic thoughts. No more haunting memories. Just me and the road. I didn't get home until the sun had started to come up and by then my phone had died. I really should have bought a charger with me. 

I crawled into bed with my wife as our young black cat yelled at me for attention. I gave him a good scratch on his tiny head and he settled down as I fell into a deep sleep. I didn't dream then and was only awoken in the afternoon by the local crack head yelling about his partner being a whore. 

My next shift into work I saw Mr Edwards again. His demeanor had changed. He had forsaken his cane and walked with newfound purpose. He gave me a creepy smile as he always did though from the quick glance I could swear his milky eyes looked more lucid. 

“So my boy. I hear you did well.” he chuckled and I braced myself for his coughing fit and violent convulsions but they didn't come. He just smiled at me with his signature grin. 

“Uhhh yeah. I think I might have been a little tired on the road. Little bit of highway hypnosis but I got there” 

“Ah now you see my boy. I told you my job made me feel young” he turned to look and see if anyone else was around before he spoke again. 

“How do you feel about doing it again for me? Double rate this time?” He shifted his eyebrows as he eagerly awaited my reply. 

That brings me to now. I'm sitting in my car about to do one of Mr Edwards deliveries again. I know that something isn't right but I don't care. I get paid. It's not just that though. I hope I get to see her again. I don't even care about the grey hairs I found on my pillow this morning.
