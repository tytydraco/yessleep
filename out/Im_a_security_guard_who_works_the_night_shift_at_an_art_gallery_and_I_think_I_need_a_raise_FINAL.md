I arrived in Ireland after a short flight, but I was too late.

The dilapidated house harboured secrets. Though I was armed with Harper’s knowledge, the brutish building still intimidated and mystified me. The terror stemmed from more than vines creeping up walls or the graffitied innards of the haunted house. It was the place’s unearthly aura. Lingering evil from the horrors that had unfolded twenty years ago.

Why did Harper have to tell me where she’d hidden the tooth? My hypothesis is that the Exacter wormed its way into her mind — maybe it finally succeeded in tricking her.

I blame myself. Harper was careful for so many years. She lowered her guard around me. Lost herself for a second. And that was all the Exacter needed. As soon as Harper exhausted her usefulness, she was slaughtered. I can still see her mangled neck, draped over the rigid back of that plastic canteen chair.

The basement was a lightless hovel that carried a damp smell. I illuminated the cobweb-ridden room with my phone, and something elicited a bloodcurdling scream from my hoarse throat.

Amy.

She was on her knees, shivering in the centre of the room. She didn’t even shield her eyes from my light. She just stared into my face with a blank, teary expression. And I realised something horrifying.

The Exacter was gone.

I couldn’t see the darkness in her eyes anymore. And if the creature had no use for servants, that could only mean one dreadful thing.

The end was nigh.

A bottle of hydrochloric acid confirmed that. It lay beside a gaping hole in the floorboards’ woodwork. Amy had destroyed Harper’s tooth — the only thing giving our eyes the power to imprison those frightful entities in their painted cells.

“My… My family’s dead,” Amy sobbed.

It was as if she’d been in a trance for years. And only at that moment, decades later, could she finally process the awfulness of what had befallen her loved ones.

“Don’t worry,” I said. “Soon, everyone will be dead.”

The woman bawled, and I wanted to empathise, but I kept seeing her younger sister’s neck — the very neck that Amy had viciously snapped several hours earlier. It was hard to trust her.

“How long has it been?” I asked, pointing at the acid-shaped hole in the floor.

“I destroyed it shortly before you arrived… Within the hour, perhaps?” Amy absentmindedly replied.

I nodded. “How long do you think we have before the world ends?”

She shrugged. “When I freed them as a child, they… they took time slithering out of the slab. They began constructing legions of creatures from the very dust of our house. Harper must’ve been upstairs for a couple of hours. And the world didn’t end. They occupied themselves with torturing my father and me… But I don’t want to talk about that. I blocked that trauma so effectively from my mind that I didn’t believe Harper’s stories for years.”

“Whatever,” I sighed. “Let’s just savour Earth’s final hours before Hell opens.”

“Listen… I’ve been reading my father’s texts…” Amy sniffed. “The ones left in this ransacked house, anyway. If we hurry, we could… Maybe…”

“I think it’s over,” I coldly stated.

Amy’s eyes sharpened, and her brow furrowed as she locked her gaze onto mine. But it wasn’t evil that I saw in her eyes — not the Exacter. No, it was resolve. The dying dregs of a desperate human’s *resolve*.

“That’s it? What about Cara?” She asked. “Are you just going to let everything end?”

“Well, what can we do? *As we speak*, the horrors are crawling out of their paintings. It won’t be long before they wreak havoc upon mankind. And we’re not exactly artists, so I doubt we could whip up…”

I trailed off, possessed by an inspired idea.

“The covered paintings on the gallery’s top floor… Exact copies of the ones downstairs…” I whispered.

Amy slowly nodded, gathering my drift. “Right. Harper’s backups — ‘backups for fuck-ups’, she used to say.”

“The name-etching ritual… must it be performed by the original artist?” I asked.

Amy shrugged. “The texts only dictate that the one who uses a sacrificial etching tool — their tooth — will bind the apocalyptic abhorrences to drawn likenesses.”

“So, if I were to etch my name into each of Harper’s backup paintings…” I thoughtfully whispered, delicately tapping one of my teeth, but then I sighed. “We’re miles from England. Thousands will have died by the time we reach the gallery.” 

Amy’s eyes widened. “You know… There are *other* ancient rituals that our father detailed in his translated texts. Mayans, Incas, and other ancient cultures learned things that modern people have forgotten. When their cities fell to ruins, the survivors utilised *centuries* of spiritual teachings to encage the Exacter and its legions in prisons. But they used the power of art for other things too.”

“What ritual could save us?” I asked.

“A painting of the gallery,” She answered. “A doorway to the *real* gallery.”

My blood froze. I immediately recalled my terrifying experience in *Prison* — being trapped in a painting that I truly believed to be reality. Harper freed me from that hellish place with an exit doorway. I swore to myself that I would stay firmly grounded in the real world for the rest of my life, but Amy was suggesting I *willingly* step back into that existential hellishness.

“And how would I ever know that I’ve returned to the real world?” I asked.

“This wouldn’t be like any of the other paintings. It’d be a portal, not a prison. You can feel the difference between painted colour and real colour. Trust me,” She said. “Even when you were in *Prison*, part of you always knew that something was wrong. Can you deny that?”

Amy was right. A painted lie could never convince a person forever, but how could I be *sure*? And then I considered the alternative option — the total extinction of humanity.

“But we’re back at square one,” I pointed out. “We need a painting of the art gallery to serve as the portal. Do *you* know how to paint? Can you create a believable likeness of the art gallery on a canvas? I certainly can’t.”

“I think you underestimate just how many paintings my sister created in her youth,” Amy said, smiling.

She guided me out of the basement on shaky legs, continuing to explain things. “We moved to England because Harper couldn’t bear this place anymore. But we *also* moved because I had business contacts in your country. Anyway, I found the perfect little spot for my teenage sister’s art gallery.”

Amy continued her story as we clambered up the creaky stairs. “So, what was the first thing my sister did when I showed her the property? She painted the ‘new prison’ for her macabre paintings. She said it gives a place *power* to be included in the ritual. Of course, I didn’t believe in her deluded ramblings back then. I’d convinced myself that none of the supernatural horrors really happened on the night of our father’s breakdown. Anyway, Harper left the painting at this house — along with many others. She said she’d do a better one at some point.”

“Do you think it’s a good enough likeness of the art gallery to work as a teleporter?” I asked.

Amy gulped. “I really hope so. I don’t want you to become trapped in some non-existent painted realm. A half-human, half-paint, splintered thing? No, thanks.”

“Great pep talk,” I said. “Really makes me want to do this.”

Amy opened the door to Harper’s bedroom and matter-of-factly replied, “Not like you have a choice, is it? Unless you want me to do it?”

I shook my head.

Inside Harper’s old bedroom, a stack of half-finished paintings lay on her dusty, neglected duvet. Amy and I sifted through the pile, eventually finding Harper’s early attempt at creating *Prison*. Obviously, before moving to England and turning the property into an art gallery, Harper’s visions of grandeur were a teenage fantasy. Fortunately, her painted vision was not *too* far removed from what the art gallery became.

“I wanted to do something for her,” Amy sombrely explained, tearily cradling the painting. “After Mum and Dad died, Harper wasn’t the same… I thought a place for her art would help her heal, as much as the paintings horrified me.”

I didn’t want to talk about Harper. The horror was too fresh — too *raw*.

“How do we turn *Prison* into a portal?” I asked.

“Sacrifice,” Amy quietly replied. “It’s always about sacrifice.”

“So… Another tooth?” I asked.

“‘To bend the construct of space, Mayans bent the mind.’ That’s what my dad wrote,” Amy said, handing me a bottle of Jack Daniels.

I laughed. “You’re fucking with me? I need to drink to save the world?”

“To travel elsewhere, you have to loosen the connection to your present position in space and time,” Amy replied with a deadpan expression. “I guess harder drugs might work, but this is all I’ve got. A bottle of Jack. I planned on drinking myself to death, after all.“

I slugged most of the liquid down my throat, ignoring the burning sensation and the desire to vomit.

“Touch the canvas,” Amy instructed. “And repeat the following words after me. Try to pronounce each syllable clearly.”

I placed my hands on the painting. Miss Andrews began to speak in an ancient language, and I followed suit. After several minutes, the alcohol started to hit my system, and I had to concentrate incredibly hard — I didn’t want to slur a single letter. The colours of the painting started to swirl, and then something horrifying happened.

My flesh began to melt.

I shrieked, truly believing that Amy Andrews had deceived me. I watched my skin liquify, meshing with the canvas, and my jaw dropped in terror.

“It’s working!” Amy cried. “Good luck, Frank.”

“What about… you?” I murmured, slipping into the canvas.

Amy smiled tearily. “Every ritual demands a sacrifice, Frank.”

The line between fiction and reality disintegrated. What remained of Harper’s bedroom had transformed into a swirling whirl of painted colours, but I saw Amy Andrews clearly. I saw that blue, painted tear, trickle down her peachy cheek. I saw the blade that she produced from her pocket. The colours started to mix, but I knew what she did.

I tried to scream at the horrifying sight, but my face was composed of a melting, painted liquid. My limbs slowly warped out of shape, and I felt nothing. That absence of sensation was the true terror. My eyesight blurred as the vibrant kaleidoscope of colours seemed to bulge and spiral. The painted art gallery grew to fill the room, and my body became sloshy paint on its canvas.

Then, I fell onto the darkened floor of the *real* art gallery. Nobody had been watching the paintings for hours. Not that it mattered. After the destruction of Harper’s tooth, eyes were powerless against the Exacter and its legions. The ritual had been broken.

Resolving to fix that, I pulled myself to my feet. The world hadn’t ended. There was time, but the gallery’s eerie silence horrified me. Not as much as the first thing I noticed, of course.

*Empty paintings*.

Every painting but *Harper’s Youth Dies* had been abandoned by the monstrosities that I was supposed to guard. The girl sat in her painting with her faceless head in her hands. She was sobbing, and I felt like doing the same. Her painted form seemed even more terrifying in the wake of the real Harper’s diabolical demise.

She mumbled, slipping her head out of her hands and motioning for me to come closer. As I did, she leant out of her canvas. I placed my ear against her face, shuddering as it slipped beneath her flesh.

“They’re destroying the upstairs paintings,” She whispered. “But they won’t find *The Apocalypse*.”

Before I could ask what she meant, her canvas flopped out of its frame and softly floated to the tiled floor. My jaw hung agape as I saw the hidden painting on the back of *Harper’s Youth Dies*.

It depicted *everything*. Every terrible entity. Every apocalyptic situation necessary to keep the demons lost in their false paradise. Clearly, that hidden painting had always been Harper’s *real* Plan B. A more efficient way of trapping the creatures. Only one painting to watch.

And only one name to etch.

Heart throbbing against my chest, I plunged my hand into my mouth. Pinching a canine with my thumb and index finger, I took a deep breath. Closing my eyes, I tugged with all of my might.

The pain was excruciating, but what made it worse was that I couldn’t seem to free the slippery canine. I needed a tool to *loosen* the ritualistic tool. I ran over to the reception desk and rummaged around in the drawer for a pair of scissors. Another deep inhale. Then, I started to slam the blades into—

Sorry, I can’t. It’s just… It’s too horrible.

I eventually dislodged the tooth. The blood gushed in a free-flowing waterfall. Hand trembling, I victoriously held the canine up to my eye and began to laugh deliriously. I was inebriated, and I’m sure that eased the pain, but it still hurt like *fuck*. Drunkenly stumbling towards *The Apocalypse*, which lay on the ground, I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel.

And then the front door opened.

“Frank?” Cara cried. “Where the fuck did you go?”

I spun around, shakily outstretching an arm. “Cara… G… Go home…”

My wife’s eyes grew, and she screamed at me. “Look out!”

A heavy hand constricted my throat. Not a human hand. I already knew what had seized me. The weighty wave of hopelessness and existential dread was unmistakable. As the hand hoisted me off the ground, the thing started to twist me around to face it.

There, inches from my choking face, was the ghastly face of the Exacter.

Its wicked white eyes pierced mine, but that wasn’t what filled me with horror — its flesh wasn’t sizzling under the weight of my gaze. No tooth. No imprisoning ritual. No *power*. And that ever-gaping, ever-slack mouth suddenly closed, as if the creature were no longer furious. In its place, the creature offered a *smile*. The most dreadful smile conceivable. The one I’m sure Amy and Harper saw on their father’s face.

The grin of a thing that had finally found a way to end mankind.

I wheezed, gasping for air as the shirtless creature, twice as tall as any human, choked me. I had never felt so utterly petrified. I eyeballed the face of boundless power. A thing older than time itself, perhaps. The edges of my vision started to blacken, but I had no tricks up my sleeve. My eyes could no longer imprison it.

And then I heard screaming.

The Exacter dropped me, more concerned with the spectacle in the main reception area. I turned to face my wife, and I screeched. Harper’s ghoul had seemingly fled its painting — the canvas which still lay on the floor, displaying *The Apocalypse* on the reverse side. And I could only watch in helpless horror as the faceless girl merged with Cara’s body.

The Exacter unleashed its boat-horn cry, and its minions inexplicably seeped through the cracks in the tiles, slinking their slender bodies into the room — morphing their flat forms into full-bodied limbs. I wondered where the cavalry had been hiding.

And I suddenly saw why they were so animated. Cara’s eyes rolled into the back of her head, and her body began to levitate. I screamed in horror, wondering why Harper had turned on me in my darkest hour. But then something incredible happened.

“Oh,” Cara said, eyes still rolling into the back of her head. “Now I see.”

The exacters began to lurch towards my hovering wife, and I watched in bewilderment as she flicked them aside. The Exacter crept across the floor towards her, crunching the meagre bodies of its henchmen beneath its feet. Cara and Harper couldn’t kill the things, but they weren’t trying to kill them. They were trying to *buy time* for me.

I crawled across the floor, breathlessly spluttering from the swollen neck that the Exacter had given me. And when I reached *The Apocalypse*, I opened the palm of my clenched hand to reveal my bloody canine. Writing tool in hand, I finally started to etch two crucial words:

*FRANK HULL*.

Those choral screams sounded again. The symphony of dying people, but it wasn’t real. *It wasn’t real*. And that was a good thing. It meant the Exacter was trying to get in my head — it meant the ritual had worked.

I looked up to see a gaping mouth of fury on the ten-foot-tall ghoul’s face. Its minions began to decompose, turning into blackened masses of paint — much as Harper had described. The creatures slipped into *The Apocalypse*, imprisoned in a painting once more.

The Exacter held onto our world for dear life, screeching under the weight of my eyes upon it. His flesh was a blazing inferno, and he released one final cry of agony before slipping into the painting of *The Apocalypse*.

I ran over to my wife, who was lying on the floor in a dazed state.

“I… I just wanted to see your place of work again,” She croaked.

I cried with laughter, relieved that my wife was okay. “What the fuck happened back there?”

Cara coughed. “I came to save you.”

“No… I mean…”

“Oh, right — the demonic possession?” Cara smiled. “It was still me in there. Harper just showed me the way.”

“Honestly, I thought you learnt your lesson the last time you strolled in here,” I said.

Cara smiled weakly. “I had to save you.”

But the evening’s shocks didn’t end with the re-imprisonment of the Exacter and the other demons.

In the early morning hours of my shift, Amy Andrews walked through the door.

I gasped, eyeing the bandaged stump that used to be her right arm. I’d misinterpreted the severity of the sacrifice she made. And I think that news saved my fractured mind. I couldn’t handle any more death. Amy’s family suffered enough. *Amy* suffered enough, locked out of her own mind for twenty years.

I intend to keep her far away from the Exacter, so he never gets his claws into her again.

We’ve talked about the future of the art gallery, but there’s only one painting that really matters anymore. There’s only one that’s still fully intact.

*The Apocalypse*.

And, well, *Harper’s Youth Dies* on the reverse side, but that’s our little secret.

Miss Andrews said I can keep the job, and she’s hired somebody else to watch the place during the day. Somebody we can trust. Somebody who understands the importance of the art gallery.

Cara.

I wasn’t too happy about my wife being involved, but nobody can be shielded from the apocalypse. No risks can be taken.

Too much is at stake.

I’m a security guard who works the night shift at an art gallery, and I think I need a raise.
