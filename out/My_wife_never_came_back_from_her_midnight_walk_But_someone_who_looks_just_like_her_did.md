My wife, Priya, always took late-night walks. Said it helped her clear her head. We lived in a small, wooded town, the kind where people leave their doors unlocked and the biggest threat is a raccoon in your trash can.

That night was nothing unusual—11:30 p.m., crisp October air, and her usual “I’ll be back in twenty” before she kissed me and stepped outside. I stayed up scrolling Reddit, half-watching a horror movie on mute.

Twenty minutes passed. Then thirty. Then forty-five.

I called her. No answer.

It wasn’t like her to ignore my calls, especially at night. I threw on a jacket, grabbed a flashlight, and went out.

The street was empty. Leaves rustled in the wind. I walked the usual loop she took—past the church, through the wooded trail, and around the little park near the creek.

Nothing.

I came back home, heart pounding. Still no sign of her. I called the police around 1:30 a.m. They came, took a statement, and told me it was probably nothing.

But I knew something was wrong. **I could feel it in my bones.**

I didn’t sleep that night. The couch became my command center—waiting, hoping.

At 6:42 a.m., I heard the front door unlock.

She walked in.

Same hoodie. Same leggings. Same soft voice saying, “Hey, you’re up early.”

My heart leapt—but then froze.

Her feet were *clean*. No dirt, no leaves, no sign she’d been out walking all night.

“You were gone for hours,” I said, trying to stay calm. “Where were you?”

She looked confused. “What are you talking about? I just went for a walk.”

I checked my phone. It was now 6:43 a.m. She had left *seven hours ago*.

“You’ve been missing. I called the police.”

She smiled—**too wide. Too calm.**

“You must’ve dozed off and dreamed it.”

That’s when I noticed it.

She made tea. **Not coffee.** Priya *hated* tea. Said it smelled like wet grass. But now, she sipped it like it was her favorite thing in the world.

“Why tea?” I asked.

She looked at the cup, as if she hadn't realized what she was drinking. Then shrugged. “Trying something new.”

That whole day, I watched her.

She looked like Priya. Spoke like Priya. Laughed at the same jokes.

But little things were off.

She hummed a tune I’d never heard. She didn’t flinch at the sight of spiders (Priya had arachnophobia). And when I showed her an old photo of us in Paris, she stared at it like a stranger.

“That’s the Eiffel Tower,” she said.

“Yeah. Our honeymoon.”

“Oh… right.” Her smile didn’t reach her eyes.

That night, I waited until she was asleep. I crept into the bathroom and swabbed her toothbrush. Sent it off to a lab my cousin works at—he owed me a favor.

I told him to check it against Priya’s DNA from a hairbrush I gave him last year when he was testing a genealogy kit.

Three days passed. Each one worse than the last.

**Because whoever she was… she started watching me.**

I’d catch her standing at the door, staring at me while I worked.

Once, I woke up at 3 a.m. to her just sitting on the edge of the bed, **smiling.**

When I asked what she was doing, she said, “Just making sure you’re real.”

On the fourth day, I got a call from my cousin.

“Dude… that’s not her,” he whispered. “The DNA doesn’t match. It’s not even close. The woman in your house isn’t your wife.”

I nearly dropped the phone.

When I turned around… she was standing right there.

“I made us tea,” she said.

I didn’t drink it.

That night, I tried to leave. I packed a bag, said I had a business trip.

But the car keys were gone.

So was my phone.

And the front door… it wouldn’t unlock. **It was like it had fused shut.**

She stood behind me, holding the keys, her smile stretching impossibly wide.

“You’re not going anywhere,” she said. “We haven’t even started.”

---

*I don’t know who she is. Or what she is. But she’s in my house. She wears my wife’s face like a mask.*

And every night, I hear my *real* wife whispering from the woods.

**“I’m still here. Don’t let her make you forget me.”**

But the voice inside… it’s getting quieter.

And the thing beside me?

**She’s getting louder.**
