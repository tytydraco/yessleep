For thousands of years, I believed I had died. I thought I was a ghost caught in my last moment. Perhaps all of humanity had died at once, and the whole world was stuck in limbo. Or, more likely, it was just me or just my family. 

It was a Monday night. My husband was asleep next to me. My child was sleeping in the next room. I was sitting in bed, scrolling through my phone. I’d seen everything on my social media feeds thousands of times - the posts just cycled back after a day or so of content. Sometimes, I would pick up the book beside me and read it for a bit. I’d been doing this for centuries and had long ago memorized it, but somehow was always just as entertained by the story. It was like I had been drugged just enough to take away the existential terror you would expect to accompany a Groundhog’s Day scenario like this. Even as I realized that an insane amount of time had passed (I think at least a few thousand years) I couldn’t bring myself to be scared or even bored. I never fell asleep. I just existed in the moment.

And there would be worse times to be stuck. I was healthy and with my family. It was the kind of night that doesn’t feel special at the time, but that you know you’ll someday miss. I mean, imagine what hell it would be if this had started on a night when I had a stomach virus or a bad cold. 

Every few hundred years, I would get up to grab a snack - leftover buffalo chicken dip (it’s always sitting in the refrigerator, just as fresh as when I left it there thousands of years ago.) Once in a millennium or so, I would check on my three year old, Charlie, always finding him peacefully sleeping. I felt no desire to wake him or my husband. I didn’t feel separated from them. I felt as if we’d all wake up together tomorrow morning, although all signs pointed to that not being a possibility. 

But over the last century or so, my quiet heaven/hell has begun to change. It started when I went downstairs for my snack and found the fridge bare. This was the most shocking thing that had happened to me in millennia. I ate a cookie instead and went back to bed. Then, just a few decades ago, I heard my son crying. The sound of another human struck me as uncanny. I was more scared than I have been since I was “alive.” I forced myself to check on him. He was fine, I think. I held him for a while and he calmed down and fell back asleep. But now I knew something was wrong. 

The next thing I noticed was that, over the years, the book began to lose its interest. And I stopped bothering with social media. It was as if the drugs were wearing off. Still, it took me probably 20 years to decide to try something new. 

I left the room and walked to my home office. There I picked up a different book, a horror novel that I had finished a few weeks before this happened. I carried it back to bed, feeling as if I was doing something very wrong. I opened it and began to read. At first, it was as I remembered. But after a few chapters, the writing turned into random letters. Then the pages went blank. I continued flipping through. Eventually, I came across more writing - “INSTANCE 05 RUNNING NORMALLY”

Beyond confused, I considered waking my husband. But for some reason, the idea terrified me.

Now I began to panic. I started pacing around the room. Then, afraid I would wake my husband, I walked to the hallway. As I continued to pace back and forth, the calendar on the wall caught my eye. Across today, February 2nd, in my own handwriting, was scribbled “Last Good Day.” This sent a chill down my spine. I must have passed this calendar dozens of times. How did I never notice this? Did I write it and not remember?

Then I notice the rest. Later in the month, “Stocked up” “Lockdown Start” “L Staying Home.”

I turn to March. “C fever” “No Peds Beds” and, finally, “Don’t Wake Them.” 

At this point, my heart is pounding. I feel as if I can’t breathe. Tonight wasn’t saved because we were all together. It was saved because it’s the last time we were all healthy. 

The time that Charlie woke up - if that even is Charlie - was it just a glitch? A replayed memory? A hallucination? A mercy from a computer simulation to keep me sane? 

I panic for a bit, but nothing happens. I end up going back to my office and curling up in my chair. And here I’ve remained. Wherever I am, my small world is breaking down. I don’t know where I’ll go next, but I’m afraid.
