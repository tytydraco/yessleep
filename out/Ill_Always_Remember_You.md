I'll always remember you.

I'll always remember when we first met. It was at the uptown mall, August 24th 1996. A dreary Saturday morning with nonstop rainfall. I was lazily picking through clothing in a dingy thrift store killing time, waiting for something to catch my eye. As I sifted through the filth that occupied the racks, I found a diamond in the rough. A gently tattered black leather jacket that smelt of peonys and cherry blossom, a truly captivating smell that I'll never forget. In reality it's the key that started our relationship and my deed of writing this letter of my thoughts and feelings of you. 

Still being in awe of such a beautifully tailored article, I attempted to try it on but I knew it wouldn't fit. Such a petite and soft piece would never contort to my masculine form. Though halfway through getting my left arm into the sleeve, I was greeted with a gift from within the leather. A hidden pocket with a broken zipper produced a 2x3 Polaroid onto the shop floor. Picking up the photo and turning it over brought me the greatest gift of my life, you.

The moment in time imprinted in that small square displayed a woman, an elegant and divine creature with luscious raven hair that curls perfectly framing her face. Her skin appeared to be as soft as silk and pale as porcelain. Her crystalline hazel eyes staring longingly at the camera taking her image, almost in a state of nirvana as she sat on a woven blanket in a field sprinkled with coreopsis and milkweed. The caption written on the bottom of the card read.. 

"The best day ever - Summer '94"

It was you. I'll always remember you.

I felt a warmth in my heart that I have not felt since I was a child. I wish to be your world, your everything. I gently pocketed the photo for safe keeping, it's temporarily my most prized possession.

It took some wordsmithing with the clerk to find out how your jacket arrived at that shop. His blabbering about the "smoothie girl" bringing in some old rags from her latest closet purge brought me so much closer to you. I purchased the jacket and immediately went to the food court in hopes of getting even closer to you. I need you to know that I exist.

It's here that I'm in my element, I'm invisible, right where I want to be. I'm a patient and dedicated man. When I set a goal, I complete that goal. I waited and watched as patrons ebb and flowed from the stand and surrounding booths in the pavilion. That's when our eyes met. In that brief moment, it felt like a lifetime in the best way imaginable. We had a life together built on love and longing for one another. Built on a foundation that destiny so graciously gifted us.

When you looked away, breaking that moment... that lifetime, it hurt. But in exchange for that pain you gave me another gift, your name. Alex.

I was too captivated by your presence to notice the name tag on your work shirt. Alex. What an immaculate name for such a divine being. As you went about your work day, helping the nameless masses in this mall, I watched. I waited. I was patient for you. I needed to be back in that world you introduced me to again.

As the crowd disappears and the lights in the mall start to dim, I knew it was time for us to take our leave. But I couldn't leave you, I can't and won't, not now not ever.

We joined the last crowd of patrons exiting the mall. You were amongst the eye of the herd while I stayed a ways back, as a watcher and a protector. Ensuring you got to your car safe and sound.

What happened next confirmed by suspicion of pious work at play. Our cars were parked next to each other. How curious yet so warming to know you feel this connection too.

I must admit Alex you should be more vigilant when you drive. I was only two car lengths behind you at most during our drive home and you didn't notice me once. We arrived to our little apartment not even 10 minutes away from where we met, so endearing just like you.

I let you go inside without me, I couldn't contain my excitement of finally getting to enjoy our first words, our first everything together. My body vibrated with adrenaline in anticipation of what you'll say.

Once I was able to collect myself, I simply let myself in through the door. I bet in your exhaustion from the work day you forgot to lock it. It's okay darling, I locked it for us.

The way you've decorated our humble abode is truly charming. I was able to really take it all in while you were in the shower. So many plants, knick knacks, and photos of our family. I'm excited to meet them one day.

I made it halfway down the hallway when that captivating scent that started it all wafted through the air.

Peony and cherry blossom.

It's like you know I'm here and you're dying to meet me as well. Don't worry my love, you will very soon. 

That precious scent brought me to our bedroom, it's not quite what imagined compared to the whimsy displayed in the front of our home. Not as much... color as I hoped. That can be fixed as early as tomorrow, if you'd let me.

Before I close out this letter I must make one confession my dear sweet Alex. My love for you knows no bounds and I would do anything for you, at your behest. I took the liberty of cutting your phone line. No need to call anyone else now that I'm here. 

If you need me, I'll be your closet. It's the best place to watch over you while you sleep to make sure you're okay.
