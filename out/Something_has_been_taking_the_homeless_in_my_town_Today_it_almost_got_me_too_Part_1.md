No matter where you live in the United States, I’m fairly certain your area has been hit somewhat by the explosion of homelessness which has swept across the country in the last decade or so. From the big cities to the small towns, you seemingly can’t escape from seeing them standing at the street corner panhandling, gathering round a center for food and aid, or just sitting on the sidewalks. Some are simply victims of circumstances, be they the rising cost of living, rents and mortgages going astronomical in price, or some other unforeseen run of bad luck. Some are victims of their own vices, throwing the money which could put a roof over their heads or a job to provide said money away for the booze and drugs they’re addicted to. And some are the leftovers from the deinstitutionalization that occurred in the mid 80s under President Reagan. Whatever the case may be, they’re everywhere now.

I work as an investigative journalist in my medium sized coastal town, population: about ten thousand. I’m someone who’s hunger for finding the truth and tenaciousness has caused me to rise through the ranks in my town’s newspaper, from the humble beginnings working freelance, to four years later having a dedicated spot on the staff. The gentleman who run it have always been appreciative of the stories I break; from the drug runners bringing fentanyl up from Mexico who’s photographs I took not only earned a front page picture, but also multiple arrests, to the story of a local preschool who, shall we just say, was up to less than scrupulous things with the money paid to by the parents of the children they had left in their charge.

That’s why I ended up getting called into Kevin, our main editor’s office a month or two ago, sitting in the comfortable leather armchair opposite him. “So, what’s the latest scoop you’d like me on, sir?” I asked as I sipped on a cup of coffee he’d offered me. He stood up, moved from behind his desk and closed the door, flipping the blinds closed as well. “How well have you been listening to the police scanners over the last few months?” he asked as he sat back down, lacing his fingers behind his head. I pulled in a deep breath through my nose as I contemplated, then let it out again. “Honestly, ever since that hopped up kid attacked his neighbor with a set of garden shears, not closely” I admitted to him. “I thought not” he admitted, leaning forwards. My curiosity was now aroused, and I leaned forward as well. “Why? What’s been going on?”

His face didn’t hold his trademark smirk, which meant I was about to be handed a very serious case. “The local police have been noticing that quite a few of the homeless population in the town limits have been…well, shall we say, pulling a Houdini” I cocked my head. “You mean they’re just disappearing? As in, for some reason heading off to other cities and towns?” He shook his head. “No” he said, “I mean they’re not showing up *anywhere* *else*. Hell, it’s like they’re just dropping off the face of the earth” Now Kevin had my full attention. “Have you heard how many?” I asked him. In my head, the two sides of my mind were already doing battle with each other. On the one hand, I felt nothing but sympathy for those who were vanishing; on the other, the journalistic side of my brain could tell this might make one hell of a story.

Kevin shook his head again. “I haven’t heard an exact number, but since January, it’s been something like sixty or seventy of them” I felt my jaw drop slightly at his words. *Holy crap.* In our town, sixty or seventy was a significant amount, even with the amount of new homeless who would show up regularly, often times bused in from the larger cities who wanted a way to get them out of their hair. Before he had a chance to tell me anything further, the phone on his desk rang. I tuned out his conversation as I drank the now cooling coffee and stared out the window at the coastline below the bluffs the newspaper office sat on. *What on earth could cause so many of these people to just up and vanish in such a short amount of time?* My mind flickered to human trafficking for a moment; the homeless would make perfect targets for those in that profession. It also wandered over to the possibility, as equally disturbing and dangerous as it may be, that it could be a serial killer, targeting the homeless specifically.

“Nate” Kevin’s voice shook me from my inner speculations, and I focused again on him. The look on his face, if possible, grimmer than it had been before, clued me in that the call had something to do with what we’d been discussing. “They just found the body of one of the missing homeless down on the beach. A couple of kids unfortunately discovered it while out enjoying themselves. “Oh, great” I groaned, knowing there’d be years of therapy in store for both them and their parents. He nodded. “I want you down there to speak to the police, since you’re on good terms with them. Find out what you can, pictures or no pictures” He stood up, and I mirrored his movements. He gestured towards the door. “As of now, you’re officially attached to this case”

Ten minutes later, I buzzed through the mid-afternoon traffic clogging up the streets, my aging Chevy Corsica easily able to slide between the larger SUV’s and crossovers. As I drove up the road opposite the beach, my mind drifted off, wondering about the case. In journalism, they teach you to focus on six specific parts of a story. Who, what, when, where, how and why. I knew the where right now, but I needed to concentrate on the remaining five areas. Seeing the flash of the police lights ahead, I slowed and pulled into one of the diagonal parking spaces not occupied by cop cars, ambulances, or in the case of the black Cadillac at the end of the line, the coroner.

I walked up to the officer stationed ahead of the yellow police tape, a young man in his mid twenties I knew well. “Hey, Evan, how’s it going?” I called as I approached. He squinted into the overcast afternoon at me and smiled. “Hey, Nate, they got you working this case already?” he asked, raising a hand, which I took with a firm shake. “Yeah, you know Kevin” I said, “He always puts me on the grim cases the others can’t stomach” It earned a laugh, which I genuinely reciprocated. Then he grew serious. “It’s a bad one, man” he said, looking for all the world a little green around the gills. I was surprised; the man was a bull, able to take almost anything. “How bad?” I asked, and he held up the police tape to let me under. “See for yourself” he said, before offering, “Ray’s down there right now”

Giving him a last look, I headed down the path to where it intersected with the sandy beach. Almost instantly I had to cover my nose at the putrid stench which wafted from where the large circle of people stood. *God, that reeks!* Thankful I’d only had coffee and no lunch, I crossed the sand, where a surly looking detective looked up at my approach. He quickly hurried over to me, holding up a hand. “Hold up there, Nate” he said. Detective Ray Broadbent, all six foot five of him, looked like the man in his late forties had already hurled his lunch at least once before. I stopped and looked at him. “Is it that bad, Ray?” I asked gently. He nodded. “I can’t say much, due to it being an ongoing investigation, but between you and me, Nate, this is one of the worst bodies I’ve seen, either here, or when I worked in Portland” I gestured down to the camera dangling from my neck. He shook his head. “No pictures this time, I’m afraid” he said, “Captain’s orders”

I pulled out my notebook, flipping it open. “Well, could you at least give me a few basic details?” I asked him. He seemed to mentally argue with himself for a moment, then nodded. I pulled out my pen. “Do you have any idea as to the identity of the victim?” I asked. “On the record, no” he said, “Ongoing investigation” I looked up at his choice of words, lowering the pad. He sighed. “Off the record, though? Yeah, I do. It’s Old Fred” I almost dropped the notebook; Old Fred had become homeless due to circumstances surrounding the closing of the local V.A. The man was always kind and polite, and I always made sure to give him a twenty or fifty when I was able to. Ray saw my expression. “Whoever did this…they’re a monster” he mumbled out.

He kept mumbling. “What kind of sick individual cuts into a man, looking for all the world like something bit a huge chunk out of him?” He stopped, realizing what he’d done. “Don’t print that” he ordered, sterner than usual. I raised my hands soothingly, to which he seemed to relax a little and nod. Even though I could stomach a lot, the detective’s words had made me realize, I didn’t want to see the body. Not if it looked like that. I decided to try and stay professional. “Does the coroner have an approximate time of death?” I asked him, holding up my notepad again. He nodded. “Yeah, Dr. Baxter says he died about midnight last night” I scribbled it down. “What about any leads, and suspects?” I asked. He shook his head. “Can’t disclose that, my friend” he said. I nodded, flipping the notebook closed and sliding it into my coat pocket. 

“I’m sorry, I can’t give anything out for the moment, not even to you” he said firmly, then turned and began walking back towards the circle of people. I watched him go, the chilly sea breeze temporarily pushing away the body’s foul odor. I knew this place would reek of it for days to come, if not weeks. Turning to the left, I decided to begin walking down the deserted beach, just to see if I could see anything of interest. As I turned, I shot one glance back at the group of officers and medical professionals. And I’d chosen the wrong time to look. A few of the men and women parted, allowing a clear view in for about four seconds. It was four seconds too long. I saw the bald, bearded face of Old Fred. His eyes were wide open and glassy. His mouth was eternally wrenched open in a scream. The look of sheer horror on his face was bone chilling, to say the least. I also saw the huge, gaping wound in his chest. 

*Oh, sweet baby Jesus*. Ray hadn’t been exaggerating; it looked like something had taken a ginormous bite out of his midsection. Thankfully, I didn’t see any more detail as the group closed up again. Trying to push the image out of my mind, but knowing I’d be seeing it in my dreams tonight for sure, I turned and quickly walked away, trying to inhale the cold sea spray and not blow chunks everywhere. It seemed to help somewhat, as I felt my racing heart begin to slow, and my breathing normalize. I looked around. If it weren’t for the throng of officers behind me, along with the remains of Old Fred, it would almost seem peaceful. Seagulls called overhead, some landing on the beach and strutting around. The sound of the lighthouse foghorn blared somewhere out in the distance, indicating a fog bank was beginning to roll in. “Well, means I don’t have very long out here” I said to myself. When the fog rolls in our town, you can barely find your way around the beach, and accidentally walk straight into the ocean.

As the thought went through my head, my eye was caught by the glint of something in the sand. I looked down, one eyebrow arching as I recognized what it was. It was a necklace, the two silver chains ending in a Tiger Shark tooth. I also knew who it. Well, who it *had* belonged to. It was Old Fred’s. Stranger still, it looked as though it had been torn; the chain had been torn in two and discarded. I raised my camera to my eye, snapping a picture of it, then looked up. That was when I noticed something. About twenty feet away from me, set into the rocky side of the cliff, was what looked like a large drainage pipe. It would’ve been easy to miss, as it had been painted in a similar color to the rocks to hide it from beachgoers, no doubt to give the area a more natural look. Out of curiosity, I approached it. And spied another object glinting in the overcast light, this time gold.

I reached the lip of the pipe and bent down to look closer. It was a golden wedding band; to be more specific, it was *Fred’s* wedding band. It had been the last truly valuable object he’d had, a memory of his long passed wife. He’d refused to hock it for any amount of money, it having too much sentimental value to him. *But…wait, if this is his ring, why isn’t it on his hand anymore?* I looked back down the beach. I could still see the mass of people crowding around the body. Then I looked down again. I raised my camera, snapping a photo of it, then looked inside the pipe itself. I could tell it went rather far back, though I couldn’t see all the way; the blackness consumed everything about forty feet in.

*And it’s just big enough to crouch walk into*, I thought. For a moment, I looked back at where Ray stood among the others. I knew the smart thing to do would be to run back and report what I found. But something stopped me. *You’re an investigative journalist, Nathan Harker. So? Investigate!* I tried to shake away the growing sensation, but eventually, it overwhelmed me. I wasn’t going to go in unarmed, though. I lifted the bottom of my coat and shirt, revealing the silver glint of the Beretta handgun I always conceal carried. Ever since I’d been threatened by the fentanyl dealers, I’d chosen to get my CC permit and carry the gun wherever I went on assignment. I didn’t want to end up dead like so many other journalists had.

Taking a deep breath, I dropped my coat and pulled a small flashlight from my coat pocket. Clicking it on, I aimed it into the pipe. I could now see the black interior further; it seemed to stretch away before rounding a corner about seventy feet in. “Glad I’m not claustrophobic” I muttered to myself, then, crouching, stepped into the pipe. It was slow going, to say the least. The smooth slickness of the pipe was made worse by the slimy algae and seaweed which had become trapped in here when the tide went out. I carefully stepped over it, not wanting to slip and fall. The camera slapped lightly against my chest as I made my way further inside. 

Suddenly, I stopped. A shiver went up my spine, the instinctive kind you get when you’re being watched by someone, but don’t see them. I shot my head up and looked down towards the corner, about fifteen feet away. I saw nothing. I turned around, looking behind me back towards the circle of light. Nothing there, either. *Maybe I actually am not that good with extremely tight spaces*, I thought. I shook my head, then continued on. The worst I was going to find in this pipe watching me would be a rather annoyed crab or something. And yet, the odd feeling remained. I reached the corner finally, peeking my head around it to look down the next stretch.

I could see it went even further down, what had to be another hundred and fifty feet, give or take a yard or two. I also saw that there were several offshoots, secondary pipes leading off the main one, though I couldn’t see where they went from here. I took a deep breath, then began to make my way down the new section. Small shafts of light fell from above, and looking up, I could see the outline of what looked like storm grates about ten to fifteen feet above my head. I realized that the pipe must not only keep the tides from collapsing the rocky cliff, but also allow rainwater to drop down and head out to sea. *Speaking of which.* The smell of the ocean was almost dizzyingly strong in here. It was as though I had a piece of waterlogged seaweed pressed right up against my nose. I noted with an exasperated breath that my sneakers were soaked through, letting out soft squelching sounds as I moved. 

But just as quickly, the thoughts were banished away out of my head as I saw something which stood out against the black of the pipe. Something smeared on one side of it, about level with my eyes. Something which looked…very *red* in the beam of my flashlight. *Is…is that blood?* I didn’t reach out and press my fingers to it, but leaned closer. It was close enough for confirmation. It, indeed *was* blood. And I honestly had a pretty good hunch as to who’s it was, considering the trail of possessions from the entrance. “Well, you found your story, Nate” I whispered almost silently to myself, “Time to get out of here and call over the cops”

I was about to turn and head back, when something caught my eye. Something which poked out just a tiny bit from the next adjoining pipe up ahead. Even from here, I could see the long, dyed green hair dangling over the edge. Tension filled every pore of my body, and I felt every muscle tighten up. Was Fred’s killer still here? As I stared, I felt a rather unfamiliar sensation race through my body. Anger. I’m not usually someone who gets angry often, but the mental image of poor Old Fred, a man who had never harmed a soul in his life sent my rage into overdrive. I quickly clicked off the flashlight, then slowly drew my pistol from its holster. If his killer *was* still here, I would turn him over to the police. After I’d dealt with him a bit. In retrospect, I know it was stupid, as a killer could probably wipe me out, even armed, as much as anyone, but I honestly wasn’t thinking straight.

*Ready or not, you sick fuck, here I come*, I thought venomously, then slowly began crouch walking forward. Whoever it was hadn’t noticed my presence, and was lying on what looked like their back just inside the offshoot. I raised the gun, holding it just over my head as I moved to be able to see into the pipe. A forehead came into view; I could see water droplets sitting on the pale skin. Overhead, I began to hear the gentle tapping as the heavens opened and rain began to fall. I stopped about six feet away from the offshoot. I still couldn’t see any more of the figure, but I wasn’t taking any chances. I aimed the gun at the bit of exposed forehead I could see.

“Okay, asshole, you listen, and you listen good” I snarled, “Right now you have a nine millimeter aimed at your head, and right now, the man holding it has a fucking hair trigger” I expected a flurry of movement, for the figure to dash to their feet. But they remained still. *Great. I’m dealing with one of THOSE types*. I spoke again. “You murdered someone I cared about, and ignoring me right now is not something you want to be doing. So, get up” There was still no move from the person. I felt myself begin to boil over, seeing red. This person could easily sit there and not give a damn about having a gun on him, and not a care in the world about the life he snuffed out. I made the rash, split second decision. “Fine, have it your way, then” I growled, then moved forward to him. A second later, the edge of the pipe revealed the person.

All anger died away in an instant, replaced with a massive dose of shock. Glassy eyes which had already clouded over stared up at the top of the pipe. The mouth was wrenched open in the same scream I’d seen on Fred’s face. From what I could tell, it looked like a woman; another homeless person, just like Fred. The dirt streaked face and shirt gave it away, as did the needle marks in her arm. I felt my breath catch in my throat. I couldn’t see her lower half; it was just out of sight around the bend, but the part I could see made me want to throw up. Just like Fred, a large chunk of her chest looked as though it had been bitten or scooped away, stretching from her shoulder and out of sight. “What the fuck…?” I managed out, swallowing back the bile surging up in my throat.

That was when the body moved. I froze, staring down at the bit of her I could see. I knew for certain she was long dead. And yet…she’d just visibly shifted. I shook my head slightly. *I must just be seeing things*, I thought. And then I heard it. I heard a soft, but deep breathing. It almost sounded like soft growling, the sound you’d hear a dog make when it’s about to attack. And then the body was suddenly yanked backwards into the offshoot. The explosion of movement caused me to stumble backwards, and I slipped on a patch of seaweed, falling onto my elbows. The Beretta fell from my hand, and I looked down, fumbling for it in the gloom.

What snatched my attention away, as I felt my fingers close around the muzzle, was the sound which emanated from the offshoot. I looked back up…and just about pissed myself. Clutching the corner of the offshoot, looking as though it were about to pull whatever it was attached to out, was…was an enormous hand. Hand wouldn’t be the right word to describe it, though. *Claw* would be more appropriate. Because each of the four digits I could see, ended in large, bone colored talons. They curved in wickedly, impaling the plastic of the pipe and piercing right through. The soft growling sound became louder, and I saw muscle flex underneath what looked like black skin. I realized with a wave of horror that, whoever…no, *whatever* was in the offshoot, was about to pull itself out into the main pipe. And I was certain in that moment of two things. That I didn’t want to see what it belonged to, and that if I stayed where I was, I would be joining Fred and the woman in a few seconds.

As much as I felt terrified turning my back to the offshoot, I forced myself to turn and began moving back down the pipe as quickly as I could. My labored, ragged breaths echoed off the plastic, and I fought to not lose my footing and fall. *I’m a dead motherfucker if I fall on my face for even a second right now!* I made it about three quarters of the way to the corner when I heard it. It sounded like a cross between a growl, and the most cruel, evil laugh I’d ever heard, echoing down towards me from the other end. Where *it* was. I didn’t want to look, but I forced myself to stare back over my shoulder. And I wish to this day, and will until the day I die that I hadn’t.

The shafts of rapidly dwindling light from above barely illuminated the pipe. I could barely make out anything in the gloom. Thankfully, it meant I couldn’t see…*whatever* it was in great detail. But it was enough to show one detail. I’d been slow going, even trying to crouch run in the cramped space. *This* thing, though, had no problem whatsoever in that department. I could tell, because the darkened shape of it was, for lack of a better word, *barreling* down the pipe at me. I could hear the crunch as the talons on its hands jammed into the pipe, propelling it forward. In that span of realization, it had halved the gap between us.

I didn’t even realize I was mumbling. “Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck..” I mumbled. In that instant, I was certain that this was about to be the end of my life. A mental image flashed through my mind; one of my own lifeless body lying in the pipe which would become my tomb, a huge chunk…no, an actual *bite* in my chest. The thought made me remember in a burst of adrenaline what I was still holding, and as it closed to within twenty feet of me, enough for me to begin to see it was covered in seaweed and kelp, I raised the Beretta and began firing.

I didn’t aim anywhere specifically, I just pointed and squeezed rapidly, screaming in abject horror as I began backpedaling around the corner and down towards the shaft of life which was my salvation. As I did, I heard it let out another sound, one which seemed to be a mix of pain and rage at its newest prey putting up a fight. The gun clicked empty, and as I kept backpedaling, I grabbed a fresh magazine from my belt as I ejected the old one. I saw the claw grab the edge of the corner, and I slammed the full mag into the gun and aimed at it. That’s when it began to laugh. Not just a half growl, half laugh; a full bodied laugh, as if it had just found something absolutely hilarious. It held a sick, wet gurgle to it, as if it were laughing through a mouth of seawater. For me, there was nothing funny about this situation. If anything, the fact it had begun to laugh filled me with even more dread and horror. *The fucking thing is enjoying this!* I knew any second, it would launch around the corner and come after me, and so I began pulling the trigger again, dumping the entire magazine into the thing’s hand and the corner of the pipe.

And then I was falling out of the mouth of the pipe. I hadn’t even realized that I’d made it to the end, until the wind was knocked out of me as I slammed into the sand and rocks. For a second, sheer panic consumed me. I was certain it was coming down to grab me by the ankle and drag me back into the pipe to my death.

That was when I realized I wasn’t alone. And it wasn’t a sight which was exactly pleasant. I was staring straight down the barrels of about a dozen pistols. Pistols which were held by stony faced police officers. I quickly recognized my predicament and hastily dropped the Beretta, raising my hands palm up. “Please, don’t shoot, for the love of God, don’t shoot!” I exclaimed. For a moment, the guns didn’t waver. And then, a familiar face came into view. Ray pushed past the other officers, looking down at me with a mixture of anger and exasperation. “Nate! What the flying *fuck* are you doing?! We could hear the gunshots from all the way down the beach!”

I didn’t answer him, I just pointed into the pipe. “In there, it’s in there!” I almost screamed. I saw the officers hesitate and slowly lower their weapons, confused looks on their faces. The same look crossed Ray’s face. “*What* is in there?” he asked seriously. I kept stammering. “There-there’s another body in the pipe, a woman’s, and there was something *else* in there, something which charged me. I had to shoot at it to slow it down!” Now I saw the officers all shift their gaze from me, to the dark interior of the pipe, their guns raised slowly towards it. All of them knew I wouldn’t make up anything so serious, and *especially* wouldn’t fire my gun unless absolutely necessary.

Ray reached down and hauled me to my feet, then reached down and picked up my gun. He tucked it into his waistband, then turned to the officers. “Radio this in, right now, then break out the shotguns and flashlights. Once I escort the witness to the police station, we’re going down the pipe. Do not lower your guards, and do *not* lower your guns” And with that, he began to lead me back down the beach. I knew better than to argue with him about going to the station for questioning, as much as I hated the small rooms with the metal tables and chairs, complete with the one way glass. After the experience I just had, it wouldn’t be even half as bad.

“Now, *who* or *what* exactly did you see in there?” he asked me as he pulled open the passenger door of his unmarked cruiser. I looked up at him, the horror and dread still circulating in my system. I just shook my head at him. He shot a look back at where the officers were converged around the entrance to the pipe, then shut the door and strode around to the driver’s side.

As he climbed in, the rain began to fall from a drizzle into a downpour. I knew as he started the engine and backed the car out of the space, that I had just stepped neck deep into something beyond my understanding or comprehension that, like it or not, I was now a part of. 

I caught a glimpse of one of the storm drains set into the side of the curb as we began to drive down the street. I saw the blackness which enveloped the interior of it. It now reminded me of a monster’s maw, poised open to devour anyone careless enough to get too close. 

And I shivered as the horrifying image of that *thing* charging towards me and laughing replayed itself over and over in my mind.
