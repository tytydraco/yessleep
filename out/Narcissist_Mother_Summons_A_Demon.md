My mother had me and my brother at 17. She shortly got divorced from our dad at 20 and moved us to a different state. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which means living with her was complete hell. She would flip out on cashiers, hit her boyfriends, and beat me and my brother with belts when we didn't do anything wrong. We would come home from school with a belt hanging on the stairwell, which meant one of us was going to get beat that night. Most of the time, I took the ass whooping for my brother. He was slightly autistic and didn't know what was going on. I would cry every night, begging for someone to help me and my brother. 


One day the narcissist said we were gonna go to church every Sunday. This happened for five years. Of course, she got into a verbal fight with the pastor in a 300 person congregation and we stopped going. So, she decided that we were going to do church every Sunday at our house instead. All three of us. One day she had a recording of Maury playing in the background on the TV. She told me, an 11-year-old girl, that I was a whore and needed to repent. She pulled out a Bible from the bookshelf, and started to read random pages. That's when shit got real.

The events that I'm about to describe, no one has ever believed me or my mother. When she started reading, the TV started to get static. I pointed at the TV. My mom got up and tried to change the channel. Nothing was happening still static on the TV. I told her maybe it was because God didn't want a heathen reading scriptures from the Bible. She told me to shut up and unplug the TV. I unplugged the TV from the wall, and there was still static. That's when the TV played Maury again, but this time the TV was unplugged. After about 30 minutes, the TV cut off. My mom was spooked. She told us to go to bed. I went to sleep that night, but opened my eyes at 3:11 and not a second later, I hear a big crash coming from downstairs where my mom's bedroom was located. 

I hear my mom scream my name. I run downstairs to see the big portrait of me and my brother that was hanging on the wall for years cracked in half on the ground. This portrait was from Easter and was taken at our old church. My mom starts praying to herself silently. She asked me if I can sleep in her room with her. At that point I was scared, so I grabbed my brother from upstairs and brought him downstairs where we all slept in my mom's room. I'm finally able to go to sleep and wake up at 4:11 to another crash. I run in the living room to where I hear the noise. Our entire glass dining room table was cracked in half through the entire middle. I start to back up slowly and walk back towards my moms room, when I saw her and my brother standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up. I look to see what they're looking at, and there's a black figure standing at the top of the stairs. It doesn't move. Without hesitation, my mom grabs me and my brothers hands and the keys and we run out the door. 

We ended up going to my grandparents house 30 minutes away. The property manager at the time took my mom to court for unpaid rent. She told the courts she couldn't go back to that apartment and there were demons inside. A few people in the courtroom were snickering. At this point because my mom was acting so crazy, child protective services was called. They asked me what I saw that night. I told them "I think my mom is sick". She was admitted. Me and my brother started living with my grandparents, and were able to grab some things from our old apartment. Life was good after that. My brother became a cop, and I'm a professional in New York City. My grandmother just recently passed, and as I was going through her things... I found some things that shocked me. She had books on spells, witchcraft, and the occult. At the bottom of the box... was my mothers old Bible.
