The Coffin Cycle

I. The White Coffin

My name is John. And I woke up in a coffin. White—inside and out. A little bigger than me. Pristine. Sealed. No sound. No smell. No escape.

A family photo rested beside my face. A mirror on the lid reflected my horror. For 29 days, there was nothing—no food, no water, no light. My body weakened. Hallucinations clawed at me. Just before I thought I'd die, a panel opened. A tray slid in—food, drugged and numbing.

I ate. I wept.

Then, the coffin hissed open.

II. The Cave

Dark. Endless. Silent.

I crawled into a vast stone cavern. No tools. No guidance. Just cold rock. I survived on moisture. I hunted rats with bare hands. I carved marks on the walls to track direction.

At night, I wrote using bits of charcoal and torn cloth.

“Still alive. I think. Caught a rat today. Tasted like metal. Dreamt of Lilly.”

It took 20 days to find the exit. Sunlight. Then—

A dart. Blackout.

III. The Sea

Again: darkness. Again: the coffin.

Another 29 days of silence. Then the hiss. Then the cold. But this time, splash—salt water.

I floated on the coffin in the middle of the ocean. No land in sight.

I drank rainwater. Caught fish. Counted stars. Wrote:

“Salt in my lungs. Salt in my brain. I think I miss the coffin.”

Day 29. Another dart.

IV. The Jungle

I woke up surrounded by green. Birdsong mocked me. I ate leaves and bark. Got sick. Got better. Climbed trees for fruit. Wrote:

“Today I married a tree. Tomorrow we argue.”

I screamed into nothing. Bled. Slept. Woke.

On the final day—a truck.

V. The Truck

The driver found me by accident. “Delivery,” the old man said.

We rode in silence. As we neared town, he glanced at the slip.

“Funny. This one’s headed to your place.”

I stood on the roadside, watching. The truck parked. The back opened.

Inside:

The white coffin.

VI. Home

Lilly burst from the house. Tears. Laughter. She ran toward me. I stepped forward.

Kaabooom.

Flame. Shrapnel. Smoke. The house vanished. She was gone.

I lived.

VII. The Letter

In the ashes, I found a letter.

“I didn’t want to say it because you were already in pain. But I found out this morning. I’m pregnant. Come home soon. Come home to us.”

The coffin vanished. The wind howled. I wrote:

“She waited. I didn’t come soon enough.”

VIII. The Whisper

Later—he came to me. His name was Bane. The man from the café. The one I’d embarrassed years ago for yelling at a cashier.

He got close. Cheeks nearly touching.

“I’m the one who did it.”

He took a step back. Pulled the trigger.

Bang.

Bane collapsed. I remained. Alone. A letter still in hand.

IX. Twelve Years Later

I rebuilt everything. Remarried. Raised my child. Built gardens. Laughed again.

Wrote:

“Some mornings I forget what the coffin smelled like.”

But the past had roots.

Before Bane died, he left a contract: Kill me once I’m happy.

Day 4,383. A sniper’s shot.

Crack.

I collapsed. Blood soaked the ground. The assassin vanished.

My final journal entry:

“I never escaped. I only borrowed freedom. Maybe that’s enough.”

X. The White Room

I woke up screaming.

White walls. White sheets. A pale ceiling fan above me.

A nurse entered with a clipboard. “Another one?” she asked.

I asked her where I was.

“St. Gideon’s Psychiatric Care. Room 29.”

I told her about the coffin, the sea, the jungle. She gave a sad smile. “You’ve written it all down before.”

She handed me a notebook. My own handwriting. Page after page. Dates I didn’t recognize.

At the end of it, one unfamiliar line:

“Delivery complete.”

The notebook shook in my hands. The nurse paused at the door.

“You know,” she said, “no one else in this ward receives packages.”

Then she was gone. And I was alone. Again.

The Coffin Cycle never ended. Not for me. Not even here.
(In the end it's just a story told by my crazy uncle )
