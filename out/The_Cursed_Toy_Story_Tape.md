Years ago, when I was just a kid, my parents took me to a neighborhood yard sale. It was one of those lazy Saturday mornings, with tables set up in driveways and lawns, cluttered with all sorts of treasures and junk. I wandered through the aisles, running my hands over old books, mismatched toys, and forgotten knick-knacks, when my eyes were drawn to a beat-up copy of Toy Story on VHS. The cover was tattered, almost peeling away, and the tape inside looked a bit warped, but being a huge fan of the movie, I felt an instant attachment. I convinced my mom to buy it for me. It was only a dollar, and she agreed, probably thinking it was a harmless way to make me happy.

Life, as it tends to do, got busy. The tape got buried under a pile of other things in my room. School, sports, new video games, and hanging out with friends took over, and months went by before I even remembered I had the tape. Then one rainy afternoon, bored out of my mind and trapped inside by the weather, I decided to finally watch it. I dug through my cluttered closet, found the old VCR, and popped the tape in, eager for a nostalgic trip down memory lane.

From the start, there were issues. The image quality was poor, with colors fading in and out, and the sound was slightly distorted. Parts of the movie skipped, creating a jarring, disjointed effect, and the whole thing had a scratchy, grainy look. I figured it was just because the tape was old and worn, and shrugged it off. I was just happy to watch one of my favorite childhood movies.

However, as I watched, I began to notice something strange. There were moments when the characters seemed to look directly at the camera, at me. I didn’t recall them breaking the fourth wall in the movie. Woody’s gaze lingered a second too long, and Buzz Lightyear seemed to almost nod in my direction. It was unsettling, but I brushed it off as my imagination or a glitch in the tape. I told myself it was just the result of the poor quality and kept watching.

A few weeks later, curiosity got the better of me. The memory of those odd moments gnawed at the back of my mind, and I decided to watch it again to see if I’d imagined the weirdness. This time, it was even more pronounced. Woody and Buzz seemed to make eye contact with me more often. At one point, Woody even gave a slight wink. It felt like they were aware of my presence, watching me as I watched them. My skin prickled with unease, but I convinced myself it was just a coincidence, an artifact of the tape’s degradation.

The final time I played it was when things took a truly horrifying turn. I was home alone one evening. The house was quiet, the kind of silence that makes every creak and groan stand out. I decided to give the tape one last try, more out of a morbid sense of curiosity than anything else. I settled into the couch, the remote in one hand, and pressed play.

The movie started as usual, with its scratchy and distorted quality. But as it progressed, the feeling of unease grew stronger. Woody and Buzz's glances seemed longer, their smiles less friendly. My heart started to pound, but I kept watching, unable to tear myself away. Then, as the movie reached its climax, both Woody and Buzz turned to the camera, their expressions shifting to something unsettlingly human. Their eyes seemed to bore into mine, and then, they spoke in unison. "We know you're watching, [my name]."

I froze. My heart felt like it was about to explode, and my skin crawled with fear. How did they know my name? I stopped the tape and ejected it immediately, my hands trembling. I was too shaken to even think about watching it again.

Determined to get rid of it, I tried burning the tape that night. But no matter how hard I tried, it wouldn’t catch fire. It seemed almost indestructible. I attempted to cut it up with scissors, smash it with a hammer, anything to destroy it, but each time I tried, the tape would somehow reappear on my video shelf, completely intact. It was as if it was mocking me, refusing to be erased from my life.

Realizing that the tape didn’t want to be destroyed, I decided to get rid of it another way. A couple of weeks later, we held our own yard sale. I slipped the tape into the pile of items I was selling, hoping to pass the curse onto someone else. An older woman bought it for a couple of bucks, smiling as she added it to her collection of retro movies. I watched her walk away with a mixture of relief and guilt, hoping I was free of it.

To this day, I don’t know what was wrong with that tape or how the characters in Toy Story knew my name. All I know is that somewhere out there, that cursed VHS is sitting on someone else’s shelf, waiting to be played. I can’t help but feel a shiver of dread whenever I think about who might find it next, and what might happen when they do. Maybe it’s still out there, looking for its next victim. Maybe it's already found them.
