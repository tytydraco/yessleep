I know it sounds cliche, but I'd like you to suspend your disbelief for the time being.  
It might sound insane, but I am seeing an online boogie man. And I'm almost at the end of my rope here.  
  
Allow me to retrace my steps here for a moment.  
  
I must have been twelve. When I discovered the first creepypasta about the Slenderman, I believe I stumbled upon it on YouTube.  
  
Of course, like any normal child, I was terrified by it; I had nightmares about it for weeks, and I couldn't sleep for fear of the slenderman coming and taking me away.  
Then, as I grew older, it gradually faded from my mind, possibly due to my maturation or the fact that I began to find creepypastas less scary.  
  
But something made me see it again, I believe it was around 2014, and I remember seeing it so vividly in a cartoon, I know it had to be Clarence, but I don't remember the entire plot of the episode, so I'm piecing it back together from memory.  
  
I believe it was something about the kids playing in a playground, and Sumo and Clearance wanting to explore the woods surrounding it, but Jeff was as usual paranoid about entering it, afraid of getting ticks or other germs on him.

  
But the other two still roped him in, and all I could think about was how normal it seemed. Like there was nothing scary about them wandering through the woods; it was played off as them being silly and goofy. 

Jeff at some point just vanished. Like he wasn't showing up in other scenes as Sumo and Clearance were goofing off, I thought it was some kind of animation error where they just forgot to add him in, but to my surprise, the characters did acknowledge his disappearance.  
  
The two seemed spooked by this, and they began running through the woods. I believe they came across a dirt road at some point, and I recall them running for their lives as the woods began to bend around them, similar to what you'd see in a Halloween episode where the main character goes into the Haunted Forrest.

At some point, they managed to get out of the woods, almost running head first into traffic at an intersection; it panned up to an overhead shot as they began to walk alongside the motorway, presumably planning to go home, bickering about going back and getting Jeff now that they had calmed down.   
  
This argument concludes with the phrase "He'll probably be fine".  
  
And, as they began to make their way along the road and the credit music began to play, I swear I saw a tall, lanky figure blending in with the trees behind them.

I don't think this was the only time I saw him; I remember vaguely that he appeared in other Cartoons as well, such as Total Drama Island and Gravity Falls, but when I bring this up with others, they don't seem to recall these sorts of episodes.

For some reason, he just left me alone for a while.  
  
I'm not sure why it came back at this point after seemingly disappearing for years.  
  
This part might be messy because I'm writing to the best of my abilities.  
  
The first time I saw this creature in real life was when my parents and I were returning from a trip and had to stop for gas because my mother and stepfather were bickering about something.   
  
 somewhere in a clearing, although faint, I saw a pair of legs, they must of reached almost 20 feet tall, its spindly almost mummified legs blending with the trees, but still faint enough to see, there was something mesmerizing about them, like I wanted to leave the car and get closer, but before I could do anything, it moved. Almost like it was gliding back into the woods.

My mother barged into the car, diverting my attention away from this monolith of a giant. As we began to drive away, I looked back to the woods, as if i had to make sure it hadn't moved while I wasn't looking.  
Although i couldn't exactly trace were it was anymore  
Sometimes I feel like I brought it home unwillingly.   


It always kept its distance after that, and I only managed to catch glimpses of it, always appearing to get closer and closer with every time I saw it, this lumbering behemoth, towering as the trees surrounding it. I can feel my hair stand up just thinking about it.

I feel like it's playing with me, or at least testing the waters, to see how far I can go before doing something.

This thought does not make me sleep better; I have been staying at home for the past week. I know it's trying to get inside, to get to me; I've heard it try to open the windows and doors; whenever I look outside, all I see is it looming in the distance, almost tauntingly; and I can hear it moving through the night, brushing against trees. I am not sure how much longer I can lie to my parents; it is so frustrating that they are unable to see this.  
That no one can see it, I feel trapped inside a birdcage, being prodded and poked by its owner.  
  
I feel like my mental state is deteriorating the longer I am kept here.  
If you know anyway on how to deal with these sort of things, please let me know.   
Im desperate.
