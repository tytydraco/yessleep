# A Short Story by R.C.Jr



The country of the Philippines has boasted a wealth of stunning natural wonders and a myriad of hunting stories, from vaguely supernatural to downright spine-chilling. 

In the past, a street in Meto Manila’s biggest city, Quezon (ke-zon), has hosted such hunting and scary tales. A particular street, Balete Drive, was named after an endemic tree, “Balete,” pronounced as ba-le-te, and has been the subject of numerous paranormal reports and investigations. 

The balete trees have been thought in many areas of the country to be dwelling places for supernatural beings or engkantos-like fayes, kapre (kap-re)– a tall, muscular man smoking a huge tobacco, or tikbalang *(tik-ba-lang)*, a half-human, half-horse humanoid. In some places, sorcery rituals are known to be performed inside the chambers formed by the tree. Also, among others, some superstitious folks suggest not bringing in balete as decorative plants inside a house as they allegedly invite ghosts.

In the past, Balete Drive, an undivided two-lane street and the main thoroughfare of New Manila, Quezon City, was lined with large balete trees that darkened the area considerably and made it appear "frightening" to some Manila residents. 

The following story was recounted to me by an old acquaintance of my father. A once fellow cab driver who used to transport people to other parts of the metro while going through the infamous Balete Drive more times than he could remember.

The man is now retired and has visited my father on an invitation to his sixty-fifth birthday. The celebration went as well as anyone could have hoped for. Families and friends that have long been separated apart were reunited. Food and drinks were aplenty, and the famous Filipino Karaoke blasted through the air.

It was thirty minutes past nine in the evening when the celebration started slowing down. One by one, guests bade my father farewell with promises that they’d be there on his next birthday. One of the guests, the old cab driver, had to stay at our place as it would be too difficult for him to go home that late. The man currently lives in a town in Laguna, a nearby province from Metro Manila and a hundred miles away from our residence in Quezon City.

We asked him to stay the night at our home for his own safety and convenience. After a series of overly dramatic convincing from my father, the man relented and decided to stay. I promised him I would drive him to the bus terminal to Laguna first thing in the morning.

It was past eleven in the evening when all the guests except for some family members and the old man had left. The celebration, however, did not entirely end, as my father, the old man, and I decided to sit at a table and pour ourselves more liquor. 

The two old timers’ conversation mostly circled around their time as fellow cab drivers working under the same cab operator. Occasionally, both men would reminisce on their exes and how they once shared the same girlfriend without them knowing until the same lady got pregnant by another cab driver from a different city.

As a thirty-one-year-old working man, it was a pleasure to see both my father and his friend reminisce about their past. As inexperienced as I was at that point in my life, I did little to contribute to the conversation. For the most part, I was there as a listener, a passenger on the two old men’s trip down memory lane. 

The conversation and drinking between all three of us lasted until past midnight. I was about to announce to my old drinking buddies that it was time to call it a night when suddenly, the old man told me to wait as he would like to tell a story he just remembered while reminiscing their past. 

My father sat straight up, seemingly taken out of his drunken stupor upon hearing his friend’s words. “What? You’re going to tell us that story again?” My father, in his drunken state, asked. “Yeah… I know I’ve told you this many times before, but your son hasn’t heard it yet.” The old man said in response. “Besides, what better way to end the night than with a good old scary story, eh?” The man added, accompanied by a chuckle.

“Alright, well, just so you know, my son here is easily spooked. Furthermore, he regularly drives through that same road where you said your encounters took place.”  My father jested, aiming to take a jab at my reluctance to listen to scary stories, especially ones about the infamous street that I knew my father was referring to. 

“Nahh..look at your son. He’s a grown-up. I’m sure he can take a few scary stories before bedtime tonight. Can you, son?” The old man uttered as his face turned towards me. “Yes, I sure can. I don’t mind a scary story before ending the night.” I confidently remarked. I didn’t know what to expect at that point, but I could tell then and there that it would be an interesting story. 

The old man fixed himself up, trying to shake off some of the alcohol in his system from a long night of drinking. “Alright, then. Here’s my story. A true life experience when I was still young, in the mid-70s, and I was in my mid-thirties if I remember correctly, and was still driving a cab with your father.” His face once again turned in my direction. “This was when I encountered something I thought only existed in horror movies or novels. An encounter which, at that time, I seriously thought would be the end of me.” The man recounted, now audibly, with a more somber tone. 

The old man’s name was Rico, and this was his story:

It was close to midnight when Rico, driving a cab assigned to him by his operator, found himself driving along the desolate stretch of Balete Drive. The streetlights flickered, casting eerie shadows from the towering balete trees that lined the road. Rico hated taking this route due to its infamy, not only due to alleged hunting but mainly due to the street’s poor lighting, mostly obscured by the tall balete trees.

The area was known to be accident-prone, and tragedies involving all sorts of motorists are reported almost monthly. His last passenger had insisted it was the quickest way to her destination. A young lady dressed in a bright red gown trying to get to a college prom held at a convention center within the nearby University of the Philippines campus.

Rico dropped his passenger off at the main gate of the convention hall and contemplated going back the same way he came, as doing so would allow for the shortest time to exit Balete Drive. Then, he remembered the time. It was fifteen past ten, and he was supposed to be at home by eleven. While his operating hours typically lasted until the wee hours, he wanted to get home early and get to bed the rest of the night. He needed to wake up early the following morning as he was contracted to drive a neighbor who was going abroad to the Middle East to an international airport in Pasay City, Manila.

This basically means that going back to the portion of the street where he entered would require him to take a longer route back home. The alternative was to take the rest of Balete Drive, exiting at a main highway leading up to his residence in Caloocan (ka-lo-o-can). While very unappealing, this option would cut his travel time by about half an hour.

After much contemplation, Rico decided to continue traversing Balete Drive. “If I just focus my attention on the road and don’t think of the stories, I should be able to exit the street in no time,” Rico said to himself, trying to suppress his apprehension. “Besides, those are just stories. Urban tales shared among friends on a drinking binge.” He added. And so, Rico went on to take the remaining distance out of Balete Drive.

The night was dark, and the moon hung low in the sky, casting a pale light over the road. The only sound was the engine's hum and the occasional rustle of leaves. Rico glanced at the clock. It was late, and he was still far from home. He turned up the radio, hoping some music would ease his tension, but the signal was weak. Only static filled the air, adding to the eerie atmosphere.   
  
Rico focused on the road ahead. “Just a few more kilometers,” he thought. However, the darkness seemed to stretch endlessly. Each turn brought unexpected bumps and shadows. He tried to keep his mind on the driving, but strange shapes flickered at the edge of his vision.

“Just my imagination,” he muttered to himself. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something watched him. Every so often, he’d catch a glimpse of movement in the trees. A stray dog? A cat? Or perhaps some college students that were up to no good? Rico shook his head, trying to dispel the creeping unease.

As he turned onto a curve suddenly, his headlights caught something. On the side of the road stood a figure—a woman in a white dress, her hair long and tangled. She looked lost and afraid. Rico’s heart raced. “Should I help her? ” he thought. But the road was dark, and his instincts told him to keep driving.

Rico hesitated but eventually slowed down. A potential passenger this late at night was rare, and fares had been scarce all day.

“Where to, ma’am?” Rico asked, rolling down the window slightly.

The woman didn’t respond. She simply opened the back door and slid into the seat behind him. Her movements were slow and deliberate, and Rico couldn’t help but notice how cold the air suddenly felt.

“Balintawak (ba-lin-ta-wak),” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Rico nodded and began driving, trying to ignore the strange chill creeping up his spine. The road was eerily quiet, save for the hum of his engine. He glanced in the rearview mirror, hoping to catch a clearer look at his passenger. 

  
“Where exactly in Balintawak would you like me to take you, miss? ” he asked, but she only stared ahead. The road twisted and turned beneath him, and the night seemed to grow darker. Rico’s mind raced. Was this a good decision? Should he have driven away?

Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw something alarming in the mirror—behind them, the shadows seemed to grow larger and darker, and an unshakable feeling of dread washed over him. He pressed the gas pedal, desperate to escape the growing fear. 

Rico’s heart is now racing. A million thoughts ran through his mind. The lady in white still hadn’t spoken a word since providing her destination. At this point, Rico decided to look in the rearview mirror to check on the woman in the backseat of the cab once again, but what he saw froze him.

The woman’s face was a blank void—no eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just an empty, pale surface where her features should have been.

Panic gripped him. He tried to focus on the road, but the rearview mirror seemed to pull his gaze back. The woman’s head was now tilted slightly as if she were staring directly at him, though she had no eyes to do so.

Rico slammed on the brakes, his heart pounding. “Ma’am, please, you need to get out!” he shouted, his voice trembling.

The woman didn’t move. Instead, she leaned forward, and he felt her cold breath against his ear.

“Why are you afraid?” she whispered. “You picked me up, didn’t you?”

The woman’s words were accompanied by a chilling mist that penetrated through Rico’s body. This was his breaking point. He stopped the cab right in the middle of the road and turned to the woman in the backseat, wanting to tell his passenger to get out of the vehicle right away.

But, as he turns, the woman vanishes from the car, nowhere to be found. Rico was at a loss for words. Was he just imagining things? Was there really a woman a few minutes ago inside the vehicle? “Am I finally losing it?” Was Rico’s final thought. 

With the woman no longer inside the vehicle, Rico started the vehicle’s engine again and continued to drive down the empty road. His knuckles turned white while tightly gripping the steering wheel. He glanced at the vehicle’s speedometer, which was clocking in more than a hundred kilometers per hour, twice the road’s speed limit of no more than fifty kilometers. 

Rico couldn’t care less at that point, as his only thoughts were to get out of the accursed Balete Drive as soon as possible. Then, after a few minutes of driving at a dangerous speed, Rico realized something. 

“Where the heck is the exit? Was Rico’s initial thought. “This road seems never to end. I’ve driven through this same road during the day, and I don’t remember the road being this long.” Rico added, muttering to himself in a desperate attempt to make sense of what was happening.

He glanced at the clock; time was passing, yet he hadn’t reached the exit. Almost an hour had passed, and Rico was still driving along Balete Drive. “This can’t be real.” Rico once again muttered to himself. “Soon, I’ll run out of gas. There’s no way I’m stopping along this road. I’ll stay inside the car and spend the rest of the night if I have to.” This was Rico’s feeble attempt at a plan should he run out of gas while trying to exit Balete Drive. 

After more than an hour had passed, Rico saw what appeared to be light in the distance, a small light flickering through his windshield. Hope surged through him. He sped towards it, hoping that he was finally nearing the exit. But as he got closer, the light vanished, leaving only darkness behind. Rico looked around. The trees now seemed to close in on him, and he felt trapped. “Please, what the heck is going on? ” he asked to nobody, his voice trembling.

Rico was growing desperate and more terrified at that point. Terrified that he may never be able to reach the exit. “Am I dead? Did the woman earlier actually end my life, and now I’m just another ghost driving along this forsaken road on an endless journey to escape? Is this the afterlife? Am I in limbo?” A series of thoughts flooded Rico’s mind, with each one drawing him closer to a somber but likely conclusion. 

In Rico’s mind, he might as well no longer be in the world of the living as there was no making sense of the events that had unfolded. Another half an hour passed, and Rico was getting tired of the endless driving. He was so tired that he even considered stopping in the middle of the road and accepting his fate. 

“No! I’m not going down without a fight! I still have my hunting knife tucked in under my seat.” This was Rico’s last flicker of resolve while checking out for the hunting knife that was gifted to him by a friend in the army.  The hunting knife has given Rico the confidence to fight off any potential robbers during his night shift. That same knife was giving him hope to, at the very least, have something to fight whatever malevolent entity that had been causing him such torment.

A few more minutes had passed when suddenly, his headlights caught something. He hit the brakes. Now, standing in the middle of the road was the same woman in a white dress, her hair long and tangled. “Oh, shi-!” It’s that woman again!” Rico exclaimed as he hit the gas and tried to drive around the woman. Just as he was about to pass her, the woman instantly vanished in thin air. Rico, however, did not stop driving. 

He was not picking up the same scary lady this time. Rico continued to drive. The road was now getting even narrower, with a steep drop on one side. He pressed on, his knuckles whiter than ever.   
  
The figure appeared again at several more turns, always maintaining the same distance. Rico’s hands trembled as he struggled to maintain control of the car. The road was becoming increasingly treacherous, with potholes and loose gravel making driving a challenge. His heart pounded in his chest, and beads of sweat trickled down his temples. 

Rico does not remember the road being this rough. The road, in fact, was among the most well-maintained, as it services motorists going in and out of the nearby university. This mattered very little to Rico. In his mind, he might as well have veered off course, ending up in a remote, secluded road that may very well lead to his eventual demise. Rico, however, kept driving.

Not a moment had passed when Rico suddenly felt an all too familiar sensation. The sensation that someone was with him in the vehicle. The atmosphere inside the vehicle almost instantly turned chilly, accompanied by a subtle but audible breathing in the backseat of the taxi. “You’re here again, aren’t you?” Rico remarked with a now surprisingly braver tone. 

The events leading up to that point have exhausted Rico of all his fears. He somewhat became desensitized to the woman’s presence inside the vehicle, and he had long come to an understanding that if this was going to be his end, then so be it. But Rico intended to fight back, whether it be using his knife or any means that would at the very least give him comfort that he went down like a man, fighting.

“I… I just want to go to my family..” Came a chilling voice from the back. “Will… you take me there… mister?” Added by the woman in the back. “Where, to Balintawak?” Rico calmly responded, trying to sound as casual as possible. “Ye… yesss… Balintawak.” Responded the woman in affirmation.

“Alright, alright. I can take you there.” Answered Rico. “But you see, you have to pay a fare for me to take you there, you know.” Rico added while now displaying his usual self as a taxi driver. There was no response from the woman in the back, however. 

“You see here, this is what we call a taxi meter.” Rico continued speaking while tapping on the taxi meter. Still, there was no response from the passenger. “This thing clocks in the distance we’ve traveled and calculates how much it’ll cost.” Rico went on to elaborate without paying any mind to his passenger’s silence. “From my estimate, the total fare from here to Balintawak should cost you around five hundred peso-“ Rico’s sentence was cut short by a new development inside the vehicle. 

The woman, who had been silent the whole time Rico was talking, all of a sudden grabbed Rico’s right hand with a grip so tight that it almost restricted blood flow to the rest of Rico’s arm. The woman’s unexpected move caused panic in Rico, shattering his initial façade of calmness and fearlessness. 

The man frantically tried to shake his right hand off of the woman’s vice grip to no avail. The woman’s hand felt ice cold, so cold that it delivered a level of pain to Rico’s entire body that he never knew he would get to feel. “Get off me, you wretched!” Rico commanded while trying to steer the vehicle from going off the road with his left hand.

The woman, however, did not relent in her assault and finally blared in Rico’s ear the words: “TAKE… ME… TO… BALINTAWAK..!” The words were so loud that Rico could feel his eardrums shattering and the vehicle’s glass windows and windshield vibrating, about to break in any second. 

Rico instinctively reached out for the hunting knife tucked safely underneath the driver’s seat with his left hand, momentarily letting go of the steering wheel. He effortlessly unsheathed the knife from its scabbard and, with all his might, stabbed the woman by the hand that was taking hold of his right arm. The knife, however, failed even to penetrate the woman’s skin. The knife would seemingly bounce off the woman’s arm with every stab that Rico attempted. 

Rico, seeing that his attacks didn’t work on the woman’s arm, aimed to stab his attacker in the face. The car, at this point, has been swerving left to right with Rico’s remaining free hand alternating between attacking the woman and manning the steering wheel. 

Rico positioned the knife to point what he assumed was the direction of the woman’s face. With the remaining strength he could muster, Rico took one full swing with the knife in his left hand at his attacker’s face. The almost ninety-degree left hook landed its intended target, the woman’s face. 

While Rico could not exactly tell where the tip of the knife landed, he surmised that it was somewhere on the lower left eye of the woman. To his horror, however, even the long-winded attack did no damage to the woman in the back. The woman did not budge and continued her vice grip on Rico’s right arm while wailing the same words as before: “TAKE… ME… TO… BALINTAWAK..!”

At that moment, Rico realizes the woman isn't simply a ghost; she's a malevolent entity feeding on his fear, slowly draining his life force with every second the cold, bony hand clutches into his. Left with no other choice, Rico turned to other means he knew could potentially ward off ghosts, ghouls, evil spirits, and anything that comes bumping into the night: Prayer.

Up until that point, Rico never considered himself a religious person. Although born and raised as a Roman Catholic, he rarely attends church or mass. He would only do so during his birthdays and Christmas Eve mass and if his devoutly  Catholic parents would drag him to attend Sunday mass each time they visited him from the province. 

While growing up in the province, Rico spent all four of his high school years at a Catholic school. During all those years, he learned to memorize common prayers, the names of several saints, and other religious invocations that surprisingly stayed with him even now that he was in his early thirties. 

Not being able to make the Sign of the Cross using his right hand, he did it with his left. This time, Rico decided to fight the entity not with physical force, which proves useless against the ethereal being, but with his will, invoking religious symbols, prayers, and anything to repel the malevolent spirit. 

Rico cried out to the Heavens for protection, for salvation. He called out all the names of the saints he knew, promised to attend every Sunday mass for the rest of his life, and ultimately made a promise to become a changed man should he survive the terrifying ordeal.

The struggle becomes a terrifying battle of wills, a fight for his sanity and his life, as the eyeless woman in white relentlessly tries to pull him into the darkness. The woman, however, is undeterred, and the car becomes a battleground between the driver’s unyielding faith and a demon eager to claim its next victim.

In a race against time, Rico doubles down on reciting prayers from his childhood, testing his faith and courage as the woman now seemingly tries to take control of the taxi, steering it towards a ditch in the side of the road. 

Desperate and determined, Rico draws on the power of his prayers, invoking ancient verses that resonate with divine strength. The woman, who now resembles more of a demonic entity, roars in fury, but Rico’s unwavering faith begins to weaken its hold. With a final, resounding prayer, Rico confronts the demon head-on, channeling all his hope and courage into one last plea for deliverance. 

And, when the tussle between Rico and the now demon-looking woman seemed never to end, a saving grace unexpectedly came. A beam of light from a semi’s headlight illuminated the vehicle. The instant illumination momentarily distracted Rico from his ordeal. For a moment, time seemed to freeze. Rico could not believe what he was seeing. A truck driven by a live human being. Even with just a second, Rico could see the male driver of the semi with his bull cap on.

At this point, Rico did not even notice that his taxi had ceased to move. He somehow managed to hit the brakes amidst the chaos and halted the vehicle to a full stop on his side of the road. Then, in only a matter of a few seconds, his awareness returned to the tribulation at hand. The demonic-looking woman, however, is gone. The woman somehow disappeared when the semi truck’s light hit the vehicle. 

Rico, not wanting to let his guard down and not fully believing that his torment was finally over, spun around the vehicle, trying to find any trace of the woman in a white dress. Finally, after what felt like hours of thoroughly checking the vehicle and the surroundings, Rico leaned back in the driver’s seat and exhaled a deep sigh of relief. 

Rico’s heart was still pounding at an exhilarated speed, and the pain in his right arm from the woman’s grip still persisted, but Rico knew that this time, he was saved. He took another few minutes to catch his abated breath before starting the ignition, and with visibly shaking hands, grabbed the steering wheel and continued to drive along Balete Drive.

Not long after, a green metal sign perched atop a metal pole had the sign that read, “You are now exiting Balete Drive.” Rico almost broke into tears upon reading the sign. “I made it! I survived!” Rico exhaled to himself with clenched fists, pounding the steering wheel for a triumphant victory over a terrifying ordeal. 

Rico made it home at two in the morning. Needless to say, he did not get any sleep and ended up fetching his neighbor an hour earlier than agreed. The neighbor did not mind the early transport to the international airport, though, as it would give them ample time to sort out everything for their travel abroad.

The ordeal left a deep mark on Rico’s life. He actively avoids Balete Drive during his shift, and if the situation really needs him to, he makes sure to drive along the road during the day. Rico also fulfilled the promises he made during his encounter at Balete Drive. He attended Sunday mass as much as he could and even became a layman later on after retiring from his job as a taxi driver. Nowadays, Rico enjoys the retired life with his family at his residence in Laguna. 

“Well, what can you say, kid? Was that a great, scary story I just told?” Recto went on to ask while gently slapping my left arm. “Yeah, it was a cool story. I’m glad you made it out alive!” I responded with an audible chuckle, signaling that while I enjoyed the story, I was unsure of its authenticity. Rico caught on to my sarcasm and showed me his right arm. “Tell me, son, what do you see?” Rico asked. I looked at him, unsure of what he wanted me to see, but I subsequently turned to the old man’s right arm while squinting my eyes. 

The old man’s skin has turned dull and wrinkled due to his advanced age, but upon careful inspection, I swear I could see a print, a hand print that, although subtle, had a clear outline of human fingers attached to a palm. “Is that what I think it is?” Was all I could say after making out a handprint on the old man’s right arm. 

“Yes, kid, it is exactly what you think it is,” Rico responded in affirmation and with a chuckle. I could only look at the old man with apparent disbelief at that point. “Are… are we done?” Our conversation was interrupted by my father, who had just woken from a nap. Unbeknownst to us, my old man fell asleep shortly after Rico started recounting his experience. 

My father had already heard the same story from his friend more times than he could count, and he would not surely mind not hearing it another time. “Yeah, I think we’re done here. I’m already way past my bedtime as it is.” Rico jested with an audible laughter. 

The two old men went to bed at around one in the morning. Rico’s recounting of the story lasted for almost an hour. I stayed awake for a few minutes in order to clean the table where we had our little soiree. 

The next morning, I made good on my promise and drove Rico to the bus station with buses that would take him home to Laguna. In tow was my father riding shotgun. After telling his scary story, Rico and I had somewhat developed a bond and he requested to be seated in the passenger seat next to me. Along the way, the old man and my father continued their conversation, reminiscing about the past. Rico occasionally spills out silly secrets from my father’s past life, all in good fun.

After forty-five minutes of driving, we arrived at the bus station. All three of us exited my car, and Rico, sporting a huge smile on his face, hugged me and my father and promised to return the following year. We finally bade Rico goodbye, and my father and I drove back home shortly after. 

Every now and then, I remember Rico’s story about his encounter with a malevolent entity and the long, empty, unending road. I would contemplate whether to believe the old man’s story was true each time. While Rico’s story may be just one of the many fabricated tales and creepy stories about the infamous road, I could also tell that the old man was not lying when he recounted his experience. 

While ultimately, I cannot say that I believe his story, on the other hand, I believe that the old man fully believes that his encounter was real. I would always be reminded of the old man’s story every time I happened to drive by the same road. I may not admit it, but as a precaution, I avoided driving through the road late at night. 

This concludes one of the many tales surrounding the infamous street along Quezon City. This is James, and this is the end of the story of Rico, the taxi, and the Woman in White of Balete Drive.
