I want to share my story that occur 7 years ago in my master degree in finance/accountability class in university. It will sound like i was psychotic but it was true. This event comeback in my mem

There was a girl (latina/italiana)  in my finance master degree class.  she tried to seduce me and made lot of weird seduction challenge on me. Sje When i tried to talk to him she was mad. 

One of the challenge she did was;

she sit at 3 seats of me during the first class of the session. Each next class,  she moves at the 2 seats near me. If I look at her, she goes back at the third seat next class And when she reached the 1 seat near me, she tried to kiss me, but i was scare and confuse, so I didn’t look at him. (She say  previously that she has a boyfriend already).

Immediately right after  i ignore his tentative of kissing me, she was so piss and she left the class and clap the door loundly. At that moment, i feel very bad for her.

When I cameback home, I tried to contact the girl and some of my classmate (they were complice on the situation) on messenger . They say I was crazy and its not true she didn’t try to kiss you. I text to them  that I was not crazy and explain what happen during the session and everything she did.  And she did other challenge all the session.

After I text the girl and the classmate, I got an appointment with the harrassment department from my university. I noticed during all the meeting, the responsable look if i cried. She said I will never see this girl ever. Personnally, she was the most  beautiful women i ever see. Very attractive

When I go  home after this scary appointment i litteraly heard this  girl screaming in my room. I also see my sister text the girl later that night. My parents were there and all the night they confront me. They say i go to far and its was all my imagination. That i misjudge the intention of this girl. I didn’t argue with my parent. I just want to see this girl in my room. The electricity panel broke in my house later the night. (Was almost intentional) I didn’t heard the scream of the girl ever after that.

I want to a 1 psychiatrist and 1 psychologist They all say i was totally normal and not crazy. They didn’t understand why this girl did that to me.

Its 7 years now, never knew or see this girl ever and what was his intention. She blocks me in internet. I drink lot of alcool, i am single, I am very traumatize.  I never retry to meet women ever against.  I don’t go out like before. I trully know everything was real even how crazy the situation was. My parent don’t want to talk about that and say i did a psychose. I play lot of video games to escape the reality I idealize a girl i thought will be the best, i trully thought she will comeback to me. But i was wrong i think she decides to let me suffer and she goes back with his boyfriend.
