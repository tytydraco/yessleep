The internet loves weird stories and strange little town experiences, and I have both in spades. My name is Lola, and I work at the consignment shop on Main Street. Don’t look at me that way, you know what I’m taking about. That little store that sells weird art, soap made by a bored housewife, maybe some essential oils from the local pushy peddler that swears it’ll cure your autism and a pile of things that are vaguely antique that always seems to be next to a fro-yo store or a virgin mobile? See, I knew you would get it. 

I moved to this tiny ass town a few years ago from Chicago and I’ve come to enjoy it, though it feels almost like a Stockholm syndrome type of thing. One night I packed up as much as I could in my beater of a camry, buckled my pet carrier in the passenger seat and drove away from the city I grew up in. I drove until my universal joint gave the ghost and ended up here with a busted car, a pissed off cat and $37.24 to my name. 

Through sheer dumb luck, the owner of this fine establishment was looking for some short term help and had a studio apartment above the store in need of a fuzzy creature to eat the spiders so Demeter and I took the jobs. Short term help became long term when Mr. Shriner, the owner; had a stroke and couldn’t take care of things anymore. He’s alright now all things considered, beyond a wheelchair and a Sylvester Stallone snarl on the left side. We see him around town sometimes, and he always sends his nephew with fresh catnip for Demeter when he comes to collect the bank bag. 

“Lola, why are you telling me all this for a Reddit post? Tell me about the weird shit in your store.” It’s called building the world, let me have my fun. 

Anyway, back to my store. We have regulars that come in, both buyers and sellers. Consigners? People who provide the weird shit we sell. I’ll introduce you to a few.  

There’s Karen, who sells essential oils (I’m not kidding, her name is Karen, she looks exactly how you think, down to the chunky blond streaked hair) and she comes in every Monday to drop off her latest batch from headquarters. She could be worse, but she gets pissy pretty quick if I cut off her pitch about thieves oil for my condition. 

Then there’s Rooter, he makes stuff out of reclaimed wood and steel he finds. His day job is construction, and he owns the company he works for so no one notices when all the lovely walnut boards disappear from time to time. He does solid work actually, I have one of his carvings in my window upstairs. 

My personal favorite, Mrs. Robichaux. She’s pushing close to eighty, a widow five times over, no kids, and a thick Cajun accent to die for. She migrated up here about sixty years ago from Baton Rouge, bringing her “magic plants” with her. She makes things with herbs from her garden. Salves, ointments, tea mixes, talismans, a really good spice blend for cheeseballs, all the good things from the garden of an ornery old woman.    

The shop is closed for the day, so I can take my time to tell you about this weird thing I found today while I wait for my takeout to get here. Shout out to Tony’s and their stromboli, best in town. (Only one in town but not my point)

So today is a Monday right? Monday is my busy day. I’m closed on Sundays, so we have to pay out our sellers, collect new stock and tally up all the countable things like inventory and money on Monday to “roll over the week” as Mr. Shriner says. I do inventory throughout the day when I have a little free time on my hands since the storage room is a straight shot from the front door, I can hear the bell ring when it opens. Demeter was watching the counter for me, stretched out across the formica top and cleaning her beans as she usually does when it’s her turn. I was shelving Karen’s oils for the week, dusting this huuuuge cabinet shelf thing as I worked when I brushed against a wiggly piece of trim. 

Before I continue, I gotta explain the store a little more. The Shriner family have lived in this town since it was just a trading post and an inn like 200 years ago. They of course, ran the trading post. As the town grew, the trading post became a general store, then that general store because bigger and started selling furniture and fabric and all those luxuries of the time. Then that general store became a department store, then they tried to build a mall outside of town but when the mill blew up and all those people died the population dropped pretty drastically so they stopped construction. Now it’s one of those places teenagers go to urban explore. 

Anyway, they were a huge part of this town and owned a few businesses that were divided among the descendants. Mr. Shriner was blessed with the family antique shop that he turned into our quaint little consignment shop. All the display furniture, and everything in my apartment are heirloom pieces he couldn’t sell when he switched the business. Ok, remember that. Back to Karen and her cure all oil.

So I tap this loose piece of trim on the cabinet right? “Great job, Lo. You’ve managed to bust the shelf that’s older than your grandmother.” I mumble as I look at the damage. When I run my finger over it, I feel a tiny metal hinge in the bottom that’s almost… rusty I guess? It’s gritty anyway. With a quick glance at the imaginary camera in front of me, a la The Office, I pop the trim open and underneath it is a rectangular button hidden in the wood. In for a penny, in for a pound right? 

If you dear reader, were provided with a mystery button in an antique cabinet would you not push it? Does it sell destruct? Would it spit out a million dollars in old currency that is now considerably higher in value because they’re from a country that no longer exists? A human skull? It was none of those but I admire your enthusiasm. This is Reddit, not a Nancy Drew game. 

So I push the little button, something clicks and I hear the creak of old hinges. It’s not obvious to me at first, but due to my condition I can’t exactly bend over to see what opened. I scoot my stool back for a better view, and peek at a door in the bottom panel that has “magically” appeared. I nudge it open with my foot and hold my breath for the most exciting part of my morning.
Inside is a smattering of curled up insect bodies, a thick layer of dust and a foot tall form wrapped in velvet. Despite the feeling of velvet making me want to pull the teeth out of my head, I pick up our mystery package. It’s heavy, and whatever is inside feels like it’s radiating cold air through the thick fabric. I nudge the door shut with my foot, and walk back to the counter with this dense thing tucked in one arm like a baby. 

Gently pushing Demeter across the counter, I set the… thing in her place. She merps in distaste at being moved and hops down, moving to her bed in the window. Obviously someone isn’t excited about our discovery. 

I peel the velvet away with hesitance to reveal a statue of a woman. The statue itself is carved from a smooth, white stone that’s not quite marble. The woman is wearing a flowy nightgown that would touch her ankles if it wasn’t torn up the side.  Her hair is hanging down in loose ringlets, and her tiny little face is carved in an unhinged scream of terror. To her credit, it’s deserved. This poor stone woman has been impaled on a stone tree stump, bent over backwards as if she fell onto it from a great height. The weirdest part to me, beyond the subject matter anyway, was how familiar she looked but I can’t quite pin who she looks like.

Truthfully the whole thing was beautifully sculpted by my untrained eye. Once I’m upstairs, I’ll call Mr. Shriner and see what he wants done with it but there’s Tony himself with my Stromboli. 



Tuesday, July 9th, 6:41 am

Hello Dear internet, I have returned. So I called Mr. Shriner, and he first informed me that it was common at one point for furniture makers to put secret cabinets in their work to hide valuables. Who knew? He also told me that the sculpture was probably from the previous owners and he didn’t have any attachment to it so I could sell it if I didn’t want it. Oddly enough, he didn’t want to look it over or have it appraised or anything, just told me to stick a tag on it for $150 and put it in the window to sell so that’s what we’ll do.

My stromboli was great btw, thanks for asking. 

I’m currently sitting in my apartment, drinking my coffee before I head downstairs. There’s a wicked storm outside, and I can hear the wind whipping around so today is going to be pretty slow. I kind of appreciate that though, I didn’t sleep great last night. I had nightmares about that statue, more specifically the woman herself. 

I am not new to nightmares, I’ve had them most my adult life. After I got sick, I gradually started having nightmares. It started once a week or so, then a few times a week, then nightly. Despite medication changes, therapist visits and at one point hypnosis, I still woke up screaming every night.  

That’s why I got Demeter actually, she’s kind of like an emotional support animal without the training. She’s a snuggler, and she’s pretty deaf so screams don’t bother her one bit when I wake up. She thinks she’s getting aggressively snuggled and I get to feel something real to remind me where I am. 

Anyway, back to the nightmare. So I’m in this big, empty building and I’m running down a hall. You know, the general “something big is chasing me” nightmare, but this time the hall ends at this little glass partition thingy protecting the edge of the floor. It keeps getting closer, and I can’t seem to slow down. I jerk to the side, hoping that if I turn I can keep running down a hall or something. Instead, I guess I overcorrected and spin myself around entirely so I’m looking down the hall I just came from, with my back pressed against the glass. I’m still running, but I’m being pressed back against the glass and i can hear it start to strain from the force I’m putting on it. I know I’m going to go through this glass and there’s nothing I can do to stop it so I look back over my shoulder to see what will inevitably cause my demise. One story down, despite being in a huge building, a rotted tree stump waits below to ram itself through me, just like that damn carving. When the glass finally shatters, I fall backwards onto the stump and wake at the exact moment I felt it pierce through my spine. 

It’s always loads of fun waking in a pool of sweat with the phantom feeling of pain right?  Once I came back to reality, I checked my alarm clock, debating if it was worth it to sleep or not. It wasn’t, so I decided to take that extra thirty minutes before I was supposed to wake to take a nice hot shower and actually make breakfast and here we are. 

Mr. Shriner’s nephew Ian will be here today to pick up the bank bag and I think I’m due for a visit from Rooter. He’s been making little puzzles out of old nails and they’ve been selling pretty well so he should be coming to collect. Demeter is very excited for her delivery and is currently yelling at me to go downstairs. I must obey my fuzzy overlord. 


Tuesday, July 9th, 3:00 pm

It’s hot as hell despite the raging storm outside  and this damn desk fan does nothing but blow its stupid little streamers at me. It’s mocking me, I’m sure of it. Anyway, Ian stopped in and asked how things were. I told him about the sculpture and he said, and I quote; “huh… anyway… bank bag?” I thought it deserved more fan fare than that but whatever. Demeter is happy. She’s rolling around the floor with her eyes as big as saucers. She always enjoys her stoned Tuesday afternoons. 

Rooter also came in today. He collected his check and dropped off another box of puzzles and a few more carvings. Exciting news for our little shop, he’s getting into woodburning! You heard it here first folks. He seemed excited about his new endeavor but he wasn’t entirely right. He said his daughter Sara has been sneaking out at night and he has no clue what to do about it. She doesn’t care about being grounded, and taking her car didn’t seem to stop her.

 “She turns eighteen next month, so what’s stopping her from just up and leaving in the middle of the night as soon as she’s old enough to?” He asks, his voice a little tight.

“She’s not going to leave in the middle of the night, she’s just being a rebellious teenager. She’ll settle down soon enough.” I tell him as I fill out his check. “Does she still hang out with those dinks with the camcorders?” 

Those dinks with the camcorders are the Brewer twins, Caleb and Kyle. They want to be directors or something and run around town with camcorders basically glued to their hands. To their credit, they have a couple cool short films on YouTube. I don’t understand how they upload the tapes though. Beyond my technological knowledge I guess. 

Rooter nods as he pockets the check and reaches down to pet Demeter.

 “She was in their last YouTube thing. The one that was filmed at the mill you know? I’m worried that validation is getting to her and she’s going to do something stupid.
Anyway…” He turns and walks towards the door until that damn statue catches his eye. 

“Hey, Lola… what’s…” he nods his head to it, though his eyes never seem to leave it. 

“Not a clue… found it in a super secret cubbyhole and the ol’ man told me to sell it. Interested?” I lean on the counter to grab packing material, knowing a sale when I see one. Rooter’s eyes never leave the stone woman as he delicately sets her on the counter and pulls out his wallet. I ring him up and wrap up his new girl, sending him on his merry way. 



Friday, July 12th, 10:30 am

We closed the shop early today. Sara Rooter is missing and I’m going to help the search party. Here’s what I know.

Sara came home from school at 3 pm, showered, went to her room and didn’t come down for dinner. Rooter said they had argued that morning about the dinks and their newest film project and she was prone to hunger strikes when they argued.

He takes up her dinner none the less at around 10 pm and she’s gone. Her window is open, the storm screen was sitting in her closet, her safety ladder was unrolled and hanging out the window. All standard so far but here’s where it gets weird ok? 

Her phone was still on the charger. What teenager goes anywhere without their phone glued to their hand? 

So Rooter picks it up to see if maybe there’s an inkling of where she went and the thing is bricked. The screen just shows snow static. I didn’t know smartphones could even do that. Not only that, but her shoes and bag were left behind too. 

The police have organized search parties, one goes to the woods surrounding town, one goes to the junkyard outside of town, and one goes to the old mill.  

Now riddle me this Batman, maybe I don’t know enough about police procedures but if these are the most common places for a kid to run off to in this town, wouldn’t the police have looked it over already themselves instead of calling in the locals? I get we have a very small police force but this feels almost incompetent. Whatever. Maybe I watch too much tv. 

Before I forget, to my knowledge right now, no one has talked to The Dinks.

In other matters, I had that same nightmare last night. Usually they don’t repeat but this time I seen something as I fell backwards. I think whatever was chasing me was a ghost of some sort. It was a cloud of dense smoke, leaving a trail of ash behind as it lumbers after me. Maybe the mall has a spooky smoke ghost haunting it? Can you imagine that, the unopened mall being haunted by the ghost of a builder’s cigarette or something. 



Saturday, July 13th 12:00 pm

The shop is open today, and surprisingly busy so I’m going to post this update real quick while I choke down my lunch. You guessed it, it’s takeout from Tony’s.
We haven’t found Sara yet. 

Rooter is a mess as you’d expect. He lost his wife about a year ago to the big C, so the fear of losing Sara too is gutting him.

 I stopped by last night when the search party was over, and he looked rough. He was in need of a shower, a nap, and probably hadn’t brushed the fur off his teeth since she disappeared. 
The weirdest part about the visit was his inability to take his eyes off that statue he bought. He was just as captivated it as the day he took it from the shop. It looked off though, I can’t quite place how. 

I thought it was all white stone but the limbs seemed to be a very pale flesh color. Maybe the lighting in the shop made it look white. We have those super fluorescent eyesore lights that wash everything out. 



Sunday, July 14th 9:13 am

Still no sign of Sara. Rooter is still a mess. Demeter is acting weird but she’s a cat so that might just be her being a cat you know? She keeps staring at that cabinet the damned statue was in as if it’s gonna reach out to bite her. 

I will admit I’ve been neglecting my shop and apartment so today is a deep clean day for everything. I have the shop mostly clean but I’ve gotta stock shelves. Karen had decided to up her stock because somehow, cinnamon bark oil is going to help us in this time of crisis. I can almost see where she’s coming from. There’s been a lot of volunteers in town since Sara disappeared, and they have been wandering in when they take their breaks but I really doubt they’re going to buy your mlm bullshit Karen. We all know you’re in debt up to your eyeballs for this company. 

Once I finish cleaning, I plan on visiting Rooter again this evening. Maybe I’ll take him some food.

I had that dream once again last night. Everything was the same set up but this time the smoke had arms. Not tendrils of smoke or anything, full on, beefy biceped arms in the color of the smoke, reaching out for me. Or maybe to push me through the glass? Who knows. 


Sunday, July 14th 10:08 pm

I just got back from Rooter’s. I stopped at the deli and grab some sandwiches before I went over but he wasn’t exactly interested. He let me in without a word and wandered back to his chair in the living room to stare at that statue again. I swear to god it’s changed. I swear it was white stone when I found it. But now that woman is definitely a pale blonde. Everything else is still smooth white stone. She wasn’t a blonde right? 

Rooter looked at the sandwich and set it on his coffee table, then his eyes drifted back to the statue. I didn’t stay long, I figured he was probably sick of people dropping in, and I can’t drive well at night anyway. 



Tuesday, July 16th 6:54 pm

They finally located The Dinks. They had been out of state for a family funeral but they did say they heard from Sara that day. They said she was going to check out a location for their next film but they wouldn’t say much else. 

Mrs. Robichaux stopped by earlier today for a restock. She brought a little extra too, gave me a tin of her herbal tea blend. 

“That child is as good as cold…” she says as she takes a puff of her cigarette. Usually, I don’t let anyone smoke in the store but who am I to tell this eighty year old with five mysteriously dead husbands what to do? “Poor baby’s with her momma now.” 

“That’s a little presumptuous, isn’t it Mrs. Robichaux? She’s only been missing a few days.” I look up from my notepad, feeling a frown creep across my face. 

“She’s not missing baby. She’s dead. I’ve seen it.” She taps her temple with a crooked finger and ashes her cigarette into her open purse. This woman is an absolute loon. Not because of the grim statements, but the purse thing. I’ll never get over that. I guess it’s better than on my floor though. As I open my mouth to respond, Demeter arches up and hisses, bapping that old cabinet with as much force a three legged cat can muster before running for the store room. “She knows too… cats are always the connected ones.” 



Wednesday, July 17th 2:14 am

I had that nightmare again. The smoke with the arms is definitely pushing me off the ledge. When I woke up, I caught the faintest whiff of sulfur and old plant matter. You know that sickly sour, earthy smell when you find a potato you forgot in your pantry? That. I smelled that. Maybe Demeter was playing in the cupboard. She likes to steal onions, so what stops her from snagging a potato and hiding it, you know?

Wednesday, July 17th 7:12 am 

They found Sara Rooter’s body. 

I wish I had a better report for you. But they found her body this morning. Someone reported a light on at the mall around midnight. 

Remember how I told you the Shriner family had built one but never opened it? I’m pretty sure they were almost ready to open it, with stores and all but within a few weeks of the big day, the gas line at the mill blew and threw a wrench in that whole process. 
Anyway, the police get a call around midnight that there’s a light on at the mall and they promptly went up the hill to check it out. When they arrived, they found the poor kid’s body.

The mall was built with glass partitions on each of the three floors to protect shoppers from falling into the plant filled atrium. In the center of the grand entrance, is a big garden bed thing, that has somehow kept itself alive all these years. I remember seeing a story about a terrarium that was sealed up in the 70s and hasn’t been opened since. Maybe it works like that. 

Sara’s body was found impaled through the back on the remnants of a tree stump in the center of the atrium, surrounded by glass from the floor above. 

The police are still there, investigating the scene but bad gas travels fast in a small town so I’m sure someone will come in tomorrow afternoon with everything anyone will know, whether it’s real or pure rumor. 



Friday, July 19th, 10:34 pm

I went to see Rooter after work today. He opened the door for me as soon as he seen me pull into the driveway and actually spoke this time but he sounded so… hollow I guess? I don’t blame him. He just lost his daughter in a horrid accident and his wife to cancer within years of each other. 

“You can ask, you know.” He mutters as he lowers himself into his chair, his arms shaking under his weight. 

“Rooter… I’m not here to-“ I trailed off when I noticed that goddamn statue in the corner. What I swear to god was once a white stone sculpture, is now painted in thin layers of colored lacquer. Her skin is still pale, and she’s still blonde but now there’s a rosiness to her cheeks that I know was never there before. 

“Ain’t she beautiful? She looks just like my Sara…” He follows my gaze, then looks back to me. Poor man… he looks like he’s aged ten years. He hasn’t shaved since she disappeared, and I think he’s lost weight. 

“They found her just like that you know? They said she was leaning on the… the partition up there… and fell from the second floor… but I don’t think she fell at all. That glass was shattered. Do you know how thick that glass was? A little thing like her wouldn’t have shattered it running at it as fast as her legs could carry here. I put the damn things in for God’s sake… didn’t know that did you?” 

I shake my head, though I’m not surprised. There’s not a lot of construction companies around here and the Shriners like to help the locals when they can. 

“Yeah… my first commercial job back in ‘00… I didn’t want to put the bid in but Alan Shriner basically begged me to… Anyway…  They let me see her before they took her away.” His eyes cloud over a little, drifting back to seeing her that last time. “She looked so scared, and she was so cold. They had her covered, but they moved it for me… she looked perfect beyond the… the…” His hand drifts over his chest. I nod so he’ll continue but push myself to my feet to find him something to eat. 

“When they brought the gurney in to take her away, they made me leave but I snuck back in. I went in through a fire entrance on the side and I watched them… M-move her from the second floor… The spot she fell from. I needed to see if the glass had maybe fallen from its bolts or something but they were still solid… she went through the glass.” I return with a couple pieces of toast and set them in front of him, then sit back down. 

“I’m so sorry Rooter…” I can’t seem to say anything else. 

“And this…” His voice wavers for a second before he scrunches his face up. He collects himself quickly and clears his throat, setting his hands in his lap. “I think someone pushed her… and I think they were hiding around in the mill before they did it… there was ash everywhere up there. Like someone cut a hole in a bag of it and drug the bag around to make a trail.” 

“You think someone…” I trail off, the idea taking the air from my lungs. Sara was just a kid. Sure, she got in trouble with The Dinks while she was filming, but nothing dangerous. Just normal teenage stuff. Why would someone kill her for that? 

Rooter nods as tears begin to roll down his scruffy cheeks. “Someone murdered my girl. I just know it.”  

I left shortly after that. He started to drink, and didn’t seem to want the company anymore. 

Demeter waited for me at the door as I got upstairs, and I think she knew something wasn’t right. She’s been up my tail, or more specifically across my shoulders the entire time I’ve been home. She makes an excellent scarf when she wants to be I guess. I’m going to shower and go to bed. Today has been painfully long and exhaustingly sad.
