**Last night I dreamt my sister was bitten by a zombie.**  
**This morning, I saw the same bite marks on her hand........**

I went to bed like usual. Nothing strange. No late-night horror movies, no weird noises, just another night.

But when I opened my eyes again, I wasn’t in my room. I was lying on a rusted hospital bed in a dark, abandoned ward. The air was thick with dust, the walls stained with something I didn’t want to think about.

And my sister was standing there too. She had a small backpack on her shoulder, looking just as confused as me.

We walked through the corridors, trying to understand where we were. Every hallway looked the same—broken tiles, flickering lights, empty stretchers. It didn’t take us long to realize we weren’t just in a hospital… we were trapped in a **maze**.

“We need to get out of here,” my sister said.

I agreed. But no matter how many doors we tried, every path twisted back into itself. Until finally—we found an exit. A huge metal door at the end of the corridor.

We ran, laughing in relief, hugging each other. We were free.

Or so we thought.

Because the second we touched the handle, a glowing **laser shield** slammed down over the door.

That’s when we heard footsteps. Familiar voices calling our names. Our friends.

Except… they weren’t our friends anymore. Their eyes were empty, their skin gray and rotting. They moved fast, snarling, teeth dripping.

Zombies.

We ran, hand in hand, dodging through the twisting halls. But everywhere we turned, there were more of them. The hospital wasn’t abandoned—it was crawling with the dead.

We finally found a safe corner as night fell. Hungry and exhausted, I remembered the backpack. Inside was food, water, and weapons—like someone had prepared us for this. We ate in silence, then armed ourselves.

For the first time in my life, I felt like the hero of a zombie movie. I even managed to headshot a few of them. For a moment, I almost enjoyed it.

But then I noticed something.

My sister had been bitten.

The skin around the wound was blackening. But unlike the others, she wasn’t turning mindless. She was still herself… except sharper, colder. Her eyes studied me in a way that didn’t feel like my sister anymore. She knew how to fight. How to think.

She was becoming something worse than a zombie.

And then—

“Wake up! It’s already 10 a.m.! What are you doing?”

I jolted upright. My mom was standing in the doorway. I was in my bed.

It was just a dream.

Or at least, that’s what I thought.

Hours later, when my sister came home from school, I told her everything. She laughed at me, told me to forget it. But when she pushed her hair back, I saw it.

The same **bite marks** from my dream. Right there on her hand.

And the way she smiled at me… it wasn’t my sister’s smile anymore.
