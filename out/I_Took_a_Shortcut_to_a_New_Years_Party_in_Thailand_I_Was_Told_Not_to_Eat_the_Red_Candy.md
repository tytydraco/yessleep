# A lot of people might think I'm crazy, or worse. But honestly, I think I actually am crazy.

Hi, my name is Aom. I'm Thai and I live in this country's overcrowded capital city. Older generations love to say that Gen Z is too demanding, can't handle hard work, won't fight through tough times. But let me ask you seriously - who could put up with this country's work system? Your boss dumps work on you right before closing time, no overtime pay whatsoever. When you finish, the boss takes all the credit.

*Ridiculous.*

I'm getting off track. I'm currently studying for my master's degree and working part-time. I used to work full-time, but the toxic atmosphere at that workplace was unbearable, so I quit. Now with New Year's approaching, my friends made plans to go to a countdown party together, typical teenager style.

**Nat:** "Hey, wanna come to my resort for countdown?"

My rich friend. The same guy who once bribed a professor for an A+.

**Me:** "What do the others say?"

**Noi:** "Sounds fun. By the way, does your area have dealers? I want two 'small ones' lol 45665765"

Noi is severely addicted to drugs. "Small ones" is slang. The numbers are how Thai people type laughter.

**Nat:** "Yeah,"

**Nat:** "But listen. If anyone tries to sell something that looks like **red candy,** don't buy it. If you do, don't eat it. Tell me immediately."

He sounded clearly nervous.

**Me:** "Why? Saving it for yourself? lol 555678 Relax, I'm not eating candy."

I was half joking.

I checked the time and put my phone down. It was already half past midnight. I went to bed, hoping to rest up from today's exhausting day of classes and work.

I live in a condo with a parking garage below. Many people say I'm rich, but the truth is, even though this condo looks really nice, it's actually very cheap. Probably because the condo doesn't have free breakfast or a swimming pool?

I soaked in the bathtub thinking about school and work. I work part-time at a famous fried chicken restaurant - the logo has an old guy with a mustache smiling. I'm lucky my employer let me have New Year's off. She's a 52-year-old woman who looks stern on the outside but is actually really kind. For example, she lets employees like us eat leftover fried chicken from the restaurant after closing.

That night I had a very strange dream. I dreamed I was in some kind of tunnel, like a railway tunnel but not quite - it looked much narrower. Something was chasing me desperately. I kept running and running until the path ahead was blocked, and I saw crates of red candy stacked at the dead end.

*Am I high on glue or something?*

**Seven days later.**

**December 31st.**

I arrived in Pattaya at 6 PM. Truth is, I should have reached the resort by 4 PM. I was two hours late.

What can I do? Bangkok traffic is just *wonderful.*

Anyway, I left home at 11:00 AM and arrived in Pattaya at 6:00 PM. And I got lost. The GPS kept trying to make me drive into the water, so I just turned it off.

*Stupid piece of shit GPS.*

I drove into a village area. The village had townhouses - all the houses looked exactly the same. Some houses only differed in their exterior color, otherwise they were completely identical. It made me think that maybe they all used the same house key too.

I found an old man selling boat noodles. Now, some of you might ask - boat noodles, but why isn't the old man selling from a boat? Well, back in the day, Bangkok had severe flooding, which forced noodle vendors to sell from boats. They'd row around neighborhoods selling noodles. And you might ask - what was the government doing at the time?

*Embezzling the budget, of course.*

Anyway, back to the story. The old man was selling from a motorcycle with a sidecar, ladling noodles for a kid. I stopped to eat some noodles. But I didn't have a bowl.

*I'm an idiot.*

So I asked the old man if I could eat there and if he could wait. He said yes. And I also asked him for directions.

"Sir, do you happen to know the way to this place?" I showed him the map where I'd marked the resort location.

"Right now you're here," the old man pointed to a spot on the edge.

*Shit.*

"You need to drive up there and turn right. Keep driving and you'll see Pieng Ta Shrine. Take a left there and keep going, you'll enter the rich folks' area."

I turned to where the old man was pointing and tried to memorize the route.

"Thank you so much, sir." I paid respect and took the bowl of noodles he handed me.

The old man's noodles were delicious. I ordered the waterfall-style with wide noodles. He made the broth really concentrated and gave generous portions of noodles. I seasoned it a bit and tasted the hot soup - it was very smooth, with just the right amount of spicy and sour. I tried slurping the noodles. They were very soft and didn't stick together.

*This is what noodles should be.*

When I finished eating, I left money for the noodles. I got into my car and prepared to drive along the route the old man told me. I noticed it was starting to get dark - I'd better hurry.

"Wait, young man!" The old man shouted like he forgot to tell me something.

"If you're really taking that route, you need to follow this paper." The old man handed me a piece of paper.

"Thank you?" I took the paper and drove off.

The old man was staring at me from behind. I saw two things in his eyes:

*Fear and worry.*

The road became desolate and forest began covering the area. The street turned to gravel, indicating the typical budget embezzlement by politicians in this country.

*Fucking corrupt politicians.*

Forest covered both sides of the road. There were wide rice fields on either side. The atmosphere was peaceful - no traffic jams, no loud noises like in the capital city.

I was about to turn on some music, but instinct told me to read the paper.

The paper was extremely old. It was covered in lots of dark yellow stains and looked like it had been folded over a hundred times. And this was the message inside:

# ̷R̷U̷L̷E̷S̷ ̷F̷O̷R̷ ̷U̷S̷I̷N̷G̷ ̷T̷H̷E̷ ̷S̷H̷O̷R̷T̷C̷U̷T̷

**1. No matter what happens, DO NOT turn back under any circumstances**

**2. Do not read rule 13**

**3. When you see Pieng Ta Shrine, DO NOT turn on your headlights. The spirits will see it as disrespectful**

**4. If you notice trees that look like human feet, do not pay attention. Just keep driving**

**5. If you hear what sounds like chanting, do not try to focus and find meaning in it. You don't want to gouge out your own eyes, do you?**

*Thank you for reading. Good luck.*

*What the hell?*

Throughout the entire drive, I felt like someone was watching me from both sides of the road. And don't worry, I followed every single rule I could read.

Before anyone gets confused - what's a preta? It's a ghost from Buddhist belief. People who hit their parents or hurt their parents' feelings emotionally. When they die, they become as tall as a palm tree, hands as big as palm leaves, mouth as small as a needle's eye because they loved to lie, and they're constantly hungry. In the morning they're burned by scorching sunlight all the time.

If the afterlife is real, this is definitely the first thing I never want to become.

While I was driving with my spine crawling, I heard a sound from behind. It sounded like huge feet following my car.

**THUD.**

**THUD.**

**THUD.**

*Shit.*

I floored it. I didn't even dare look back.

And a tree fell toward me.

**Fuck.**

I swerved the wheel and dodged it just barely. And the sound started to sound like running, getting closer and closer. The road felt like it was stretching endlessly.

And a huge tree ahead suddenly started falling to block my entire path. So I drove as fast as possible to get past it.

*Just a little more.*

The tree was almost down.

*Please.*

The tree fell onto the road, blocking the way...

But my car was fast enough to clear the distance, so I survived by a hair.

*Namo Buddhaya.*

And I snuck a glance behind me - I saw the pretas. There were about five of them, and next to the fallen tree, there were **crates of red candy** just sitting there.

*What the fuck?*

I drove fast until I reached my friend's resort.

The entire time I was driving on that road, I felt strangely spaced out. My consciousness started returning when I saw my friend's resort in the distance. I drove up and noticed the area the old man mentioned - the one with rich people's houses. There were many mansions that looked uninhabited.

I wonder why rich people like buying houses and just leaving them empty instead of living in them.

The party was in full swing. I spent over 5 minutes looking for parking because cars were parked all around the resort, even on the beach. And I noticed there was another entrance to the resort, right off the main road that I had passed.

***Damn it.***

I'm about to enter my friend's resort now. I'll probably get nagged about being late as usual. Well, what can I do? It's not like I have a private jet like them.

I'll write more later.

**See you.**
