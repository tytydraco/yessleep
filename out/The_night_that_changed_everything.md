 I was laying down in my bed trying to fall asleep, when I heard some strange voice outside my window, I didn’t really pay attention to it since many things can happen in this really tiny town that I live in; for context I live in a far away town, separated from the other cities and away from the human beings, all that surrounded our town were mountains, many many mountains surrounding it, which made it very hard to cross it so people in my town prefer to stay close to there homes than trying to get out, which also a reason why everyone knows each other too.

The sound from my window was strange, it really shook me awake when I close my eyes to try and sleep, I’m used to hearing sounds of animals, cats fighting, dogs barking at something, or even someone walking in the distance, but every-time I look out I find nothing, so every-time I hear the sounds I just go to sleep and eventually fall into deep sleep; but this time was different, it sounded like inhuman-being screams, something very distant screaming, it wasn’t screams of grieving or screams of fear, it sounded more abnormal, like some creature is out there trying to escape or even scare the shit out of children mostly.

As always I ignored the sounds, but it got louder and louder every-time I try to fall into deep sleep, eventually it annoyed me so much that I got up to look outside, “Amy” I heard my sister calling out for me. “Why are you awake?” She said, which made me think that she must’ve fell into deep sleep and didn’t hear the voices, “Some creepy sounds are outside and I wanted to see what’s up”, then she removed the cover off of herself then i saw a book in her hands that she was holding open, which means she was awake the whole time, and she didn’t even hear a thing? 

She looked outside before I did and assured me that there’s nothing outside and just go to sleep, at first i thought that it was just as usual but the thing is that I couldn’t even hear a bark from our dog “Archie”, Archie is a big german shepherd, and he was trained to attack anyone trying to break in; his training sometimes gets us into trouble because he even attacks and barks at people walking on the side walk, “Sophie” my older sister and I have room facing the front of the house so we are able to see everything too; “so… if my sister didn’t see it and neither did Archie I must’ve been hallucinating” I think to myself.

The sound though are not getting quieter it’s even have been worse getting more aggressive and like someone is bloody screaming, screaming so hard that the air must have left their lungs, but they don’t catch a single breath.
The worse the sounds are getting the more I was growing more curious.
I decide to open just a little of the blinds to see what’s out there causing these bloody screams, I hoped to see something reasonable but what i saw was so much worse.

The moment I moved the blinds a cold shiver shifted down to my spine, causing me to freeze, what I saw was unimaginable, a very tall creature women built like with long black hair, very tall and thin, with pale skin even more like white skin, with red blood colored eyes, the creature or shall I call it the women had her mouth wide open staring into the neighbor’s house, screaming at the top of her lungs into blank space that I thought she was getting murdered, she had nothing with her and she didn’t even come close to my direction, but her abnormal screams shook the fuck out of me, she even sounded like she’s came out straight from hell.

I was so scared the only thing I thought of doing was getting back to bed, and eventually I fell back asleep, dreaming that she might chase me next.

The very next morning I woke up to my grandma blessing the house; apparently the neighbor that had the creepy tall women screaming like she was getting killed, has cut his fingers with a kitchen knife and lack of blood left him with no soul, she also added that he’s been seeing abnormal stuff; as the priest said when he arrived to his house “he drew with blood all over the walls describing a very tall women being murdered, and he died of lack of blood, as I know the lady lived in our town and got killed by her people when they found out that she was a witch”. “they warned people not to bury her or even touch her, but her family was too stubborn and they buried her”. The priest took a long breath before continuing, “when the people found out that she was buried in the cemetery they dug her out, apparently this action made her soul furious that it haunts anyone who was curious to find out about her, looking at her empty grave or even at her would make her haunt you.”

Hearing the word of the priest made my heart beat faster, knowing that I’ve seen her, and not knowing how to get out of this town made fear more, am I next? Or will she spare my life? I can’t find out, I’ll be dead and only my blood will be remembered
