Hi redditors of r/nosleep. Thanks for reading and engaging with comments and shares! I wanted to give a quick note before you read part three. It’s the First time that I’ve posted anything as a multiple part series so I’m still getting used to it. I’m putting the link to the first part below. The second part Is actually one of the first comments on that post instead of in a post of its own. So you can see them both in the link below. Thanks again for taking the time to read and I hope that you continue to enjoy the story as it enters part 3!

(Pt3) 

I needed to try and do something to be able to search for answers without the demon making an appearance. It was clear that it wasn’t happy about my search for information and it made sure to let me know it didn’t approve. 

It’s been over a month now, and with each day my hopes that maybe I will get used to it is fading.

One day it was following me as I walked down the street. I learned that it wasn’t just my mother or grandmother it could decide to look like, but also my friends and acquaintances- dead or alive - but as my late mother had last said to me, more than anything “it likes to look like family.” 

It followed me down the street about ten feet behind me. Passing unnoticed through the crowd. It appeared this time as a boy I had gone out with. This time it had eyes, only one of them dangling from the socket. Blood streaks down its cheeks. It just followed behind limping on its disfigured legs. 

Then I tried something that I couldn’t believe I hadn’t tried sooner. As I approached ST Anthony’s Catholic Church I hurried up the steps and through the door. After all it’s a demon right? If there was anytime to find God it was now. I walked to the middle of the cathedral and turned to wait and see if it was able to enter. After about fifteen min, I felt great relief that i appeared to find a sanctuary from this curse.

I shrieked and jumped a few feet at the sound of a voice saying “welcome child” echoing from across the church. “My apologies, I didn’t mean to frighten you. I’m Father George” 

Trembling a little and unsure what to say I managed to mutter “…hi…I’m *****” he told me it was nice to meet me and asked what he could do for me. “I just need to…uhmm…get a break from…”

“Your demons?” I was looked at him with some shock.

“What did you say?” I asked as I wondered if I should flee. 

“You’re demons. We all have to grapple with our inner demons in this life. It can take its toll on us, spiritually and emotionally.” I relaxed, and thought to my self he just HAD to phrase it like that.

“Yeah, you’re more right than you know. Look i…uhh…I’m not catholic. Can’t really say I come from a particularly religious family at all actually. But…i have some work I need to do.. would it be okay if I hung around here and worked for a little?”

He looked at me momentarily before telling me I was welcome to stay as long as I liked. He also informed me that the church had its own library and instructed me to follow him to it through the courtyard. I was nervous that it might not be holy enough or something like the chapel to keep the demon out. Walking through the courtyard I saw it standing motionless outside the church grounds. Just staring. It looked like my mom again, only I noticed, it looked a little less…demon like than usual. Almost like it was my mom, just an empty dead gaze and somewhat pale complection. 

The church library was the perfect resource. I looked for anything related to demons, searched for details that seemed familiar to what I’d read in the diaries (which didn’t reveal much). I didn’t want to leave. Each time I looked out of a window, there it was, staring. Sometimes motionless. Other times it would act out in disturbing ways. Jumping infront of a truck. Shooting itself. Vomiting a stream of dark - almost black colored blood. I stopped looking.

Suddenly, I was startled awake. I had fallen asleep on a pile of books. Father George offered to take me home. The demon stayed away on the drive. He asked why I was reading so much about demons. I didn’t know how much to say. But I told him “I think there is a demon. A real one, that’s attached to me and it looks like it’s been tormenting my family for generations.” He hadn’t reacted at all with skepticism. Even though he was a priest, I was still surprised. He asked what I knew about it. How it acted. Who it attached too. I told him what i knew.

“I may know what kind of creature you are referring too. I’ll have to dig up some things that might help you. Come see tomorrow as soon as you can”

I couldn’t believe that i had stumbled across someone who knew what I was talking about, and maybe could help. It felt nice to not feel as alone. Tomorrow could not come soon enough. He gave me a little jar with clear liquid. “Holy water” he said “now, sometimes…holy water doesn’t do a damned thing. But sometimes it does” I thanked him and went inside. 

My dad had already gone to bed. As I entered my room, which cast a dim light from my desk lamp, I tried to mentally prepare myself to get through the night. Entering the room I was surprised yet again as I saw myself, sitting at the desk. It looked at me through the reflection menacingly. It smiled with black and rotting gums. My mouth suddenly felt dirty and putrid. It laughed a sickening, cackling laugh as it turned. “MY FACE MY PRETTY LITTLE FACE” it cried as it took its hands, my hands, and clawed at its cheeks. The flesh torn from the muscles and skull. “IN YOUR SKIN IM GONNA GET IN YOUR SKIN” it said as it continued to tear at its face. As I stepped away, crying in horror my face suddenly felt burning hot and a sharp excruciating pain consumed me as if my face was actually having the flesh torn from it. 

My dad was awoken and interrupted the demons game. He appeared concerned. Like he did with my mother. I have to figure something out fast.
