It was a fairly quiet drive out to the coordinates we were given to check out. Flynn and I had fairly different music tastes, and as a sort of truce to not have to battle it out between his weird East Coast indie punk and my 2010s white girl party music we had elected to ride either in silence or listen to a podcast, though neither of us had prepared a podcasts before driving and there was no way either of us would get the signal to play it there in the woods.

“What’s up with this place again?” Flynn asked, flipping through his personal location notes.

“I’m not sure of the exacts,” I replied, “Amy just said something about a lot of the deer and such avoiding this area for some reason, wants us to check it out.”

“Couldn’t it just be a bear or something?” he said, softly shaking his head.

I couldn’t blame his annoyance; it was Christmas week after all, and we were supposed to be resting at home. I do field ecology work, and Flynn is one of the fire watchers who’s out of rotation this season. He had only gotten back home to his family a few weeks before and was called back in for this the day before. I myself was getting ready to leave for out of state when Amy called me.

“It might be, but Amy is worried over every little thing; best to sate her lest we have even more work to do in January,” I said back.

“What’s she think it is? A CWD outbreak or something? Deer are fucking scared of everything, a tree could have fallen there last month, and they would still be steering clear of it,” he rubbed his temples as he spoke.

Flynn was normally amicable and excited by forest work, but his anger was palpable. I felt the weight of having to be that one to keep up morale for once.

“I don’t know, man, let’s just get in there, look around, tell Amy there’s nothing there, then we can leave and go back to our families for the rest of the month,” I tried to hide how annoyed I was as well, but I came to realize just how negative I was sounding as well.

“Whatever,” he said back, taking out an old Gameboy Advance and playing a random game he pulled from his bag.

We sat in silence the rest of the drive to where the Jeep couldn’t go any further, and we’d have to walk the rest of the way. Despite his annoyance, Flynn always loves a hike. I could tell getting to go on a trail was peeking through his moody mask as he sighed, “Let’s get this over with.”

 Trading the map/compass and the field notes between each other every ten or so minutes, we reached the general location in about an hour and a half. It was mostly a normal stretch of untrailed forest except for a small rock outcropping that sat dead center on our given coordinates, so we did some circles around it.

We didn’t find anything particular enough to note for a report, but there were some interesting-looking bushes and saplings around. Looking at them made me think of laying a trail this way for anyone else who’d want to see them, and Flynn seemed to share my interest.

There were a couple of shrubs that, instead of being singular balls of branches and leaves, stood on four roots that led up from the ground into a normal grouping of shrubbery, most only the size of two fists. There were also similar-looking ones that had the same layout but were slightly larger, sapling-sized, with the shrub mass replaced with a thicker bit of wood and the roots about the thickness of two fingers.

There were several of each type. I assumed at that point that they were normal plants that had all grown over something, that something now disappearing and leaving the plants behind, grown into this shape.

I thought my mental question had been answered when I looked over to the rock formation and saw a small bit of rubble at the bottom. Looking above it, I saw a chamber that the falling rocks had left. The chamber was about big enough to hold a person; it seemed we had found our answer.

“Look at that, looks like the rocks shifted and it caused a mini slide, the sound must have scared the deer, so now they’re steering clear of the area,” I said, also writing the area down in my field notes.

“Shame we’ve never been out here,” Flynn said to both me and me without looking at my discovery, “these growth formations are pretty- Shit!” My neck snapped to look at Flynn.

He had already begun going to suck the cut; he had gotten on his index finger, leading into the center of his palm.

“Piece of shit cut me,” he said under his breath.

Flynn was known to be reckless in the field, always falling, getting bitten, or being cut. He almost drowned one time because he slipped and hit his head sliding down a stream and landed in a waist-deep pond, knocked out. Amy was there to pull him out, thankfully.

“Let me grab something for it,” I said, taking my bag off my back, taking out a small white box.

The box was the first aid kit we were supposed to carry everywhere and was labeled as such, though the “irst” in first had been covered in masking tape and written on, making it say “Flynn Aid Kit,” a joke one of our colleagues had done to all the first aid kits in April that none of us bothered to peel off.

I grabbed the bottle of disinfectant spray and a small bit of gauze and cotton to dress the wound.

“I can do it myself, Robin,” Flynn said. I was already spraying the cut.

“You’re slow, and it’s cold as hell. The faster we can call Amy and get out of here, the faster I can be warm till the new year,” I didn’t even look at his face while he talked, fully dressing the cut in about 45 seconds.

As we got up to leave, I accidentally kicked one of the shrubs, ripping it out of the ground and landing about 5 feet from me. Flynn and I looked at each other, then at it. I decided it was interesting enough to bring back and pot, so I carefully slid it into my bag, and we got back on the trail.

Getting back to the Jeep, we called Amy, gave her a fair helping of grievance for making us come out when we were supposed to be off, then let her know it was nothing to worry about, and it was just a mini rock slide.

Flynn left as soon as we got back to the main research cabin, but I still had a day’s worth of packing and now cleaning to do since I had to stay in the cabin a day longer than expected. I would’ve been gone the next day, but apparently, some snow washed out a road farther up during the night, and I was stuck at the cabin till someone could come get me in a better off-roading car than my 2007 Toyota Corolla.

I had decided to waste my time potting the plant in my bag, distracting myself for an hour as I got it ready.

In the middle of my work, I got a text from Flynn.

“Hey man, I just got in late last night and woke up with the fever, are you feeling alright?” it read simply.

“I’m alright, you probably just caught something being out in the cold,” I texted back.

“KK, just checking in, Merry Christmas Robin, the wife says hi,” he sent a picture with him, his wife, and his two children waving at the camera. Normally, I’d stop by on Christmas day for dinner, but at the rate it was going, I wasn’t sure if I’d be in civilization before I had to go back after New Year's.

I got the thing fully planted in a large pot and had it in the common area, watching DVDs on the TV to pass the time, falling asleep after my second rewatch of Home Alone.

I woke up around noon the next day, made myself some oatmeal and fruit, and sat down to continue my slow binge of every Christmas movie anyone has left in this cabin over the years of it being there before checking my phone, not expecting anything, but seeing another text from Flynn.

“Hey, texting again, fever is still pretty bad, feeling like death warmed over, plus now my scalp is itchy, sounds like any plant sickness you know of?” it said

“Nothing I know of, probably dirt and sand and shit from the woods you haven’t fully washed off yet,” I replied

“Did you manage to pot that shrub we got?” he said back

“Yeah, I did,” I sent a picture of it sitting next to the couch.

“Sick, anyway, sorry to bother you, Merry Christmas again,” he texted.

“You too, Flynn,” I put the phone down and just kinda zoned out for a while.

Out of sheer boredom, I snapped myself out of my dazed state around an hour later and started reading through a lot of the field manuals around and generally wasting time. I came back to the common room, having thoroughly exhausted the far from expansive library of field guides, ranger diaries, and pamphlets lying around the building.

Deciding to take a further gander at my plant, I noticed a small sprig off to the side of it. On the ground was this small twig, almost too small to see. Despite its size, it seemed fully formed, even had tiny leaves that dotted it that looked similar to the plant’s.

I was caught out of interest by another text, this time from Amy.

“Has Flynn been texting you about this cold he has, too?” it read.

“Yeah, every couple of hours he’s telling me about a new symptom like he’s got the plague or something,” I said back.

“I told him to keep his shit to you and himself. I have anxiety about my own self enough; I don’t need him giving me something new to watch out for,” I could hear the exasperation in her voice.

“Well, thanks for giving me a break then, Amy,” I texted back, then put my phone down.

I momentarily found quiet until another text came through, now from Flynn.

“Just got chewed out by Amy, but is it normal for my teeth to feel weird during a cold? Feels like I haven’t gotten sick in years,” I was confused at his words.

“Define ‘weird’” his texting icon lit up and went down a couple of times over the next five minutes, like he was thinking of what to say next.

“I don’t know, like tingly. You know the feeling when your adult teeth would push out your baby teeth, and it’d feel like an itch in your gum you couldn’t reach? Kinda like that,” I thought a moment.

“You might have a sinus infection,” I said simply.

“Makes sense, that’d explain the pressure behind my eyes as well,” I looked at my phone, shocked for a few moments.

“What do you mean by pressure behind your eyes?” he began texting back.

“You know, like a pushing feeling, but sinus pressure would definitely do that too, so I’m not worried anymore.”

“Whatever you say,” I texted back, turning off my phone to fully rest my brain.

I numbed myself for a few more hours before going back to sleep and waking up later into the next morning. Turning my phone back on to see a bunch of missed calls from Flynn and several texts.

“The pressure is getting stronger. I’m not sure what’s going on.”

“My wife didn’t get a fever, but she’s saying she has the teeth thing too, feel bad for giving it to her, but just happy it’s contagious like a normal cold, haha.”

“Kid just woke up with a fever, there goes my fun.”

“I’m starting to get a splitting headache, shit sucks.”

“Hey Robin? I think something is wrong.”

“Robin? Hello.”

“Robin, please answer. I think something is really wrong. I’m feeling awful.”

I texted back over and over again, even called him, his house, his wife, nothing picked up or answered, and my texts were left delivered. It sat like that all day, nothing went through, and I was worried sick, so I decided to call Amy.

“Have you heard from Flynn?” I asked.

“Not since I told him to stop talking to me about his cold, why?” she said back.

“He just sent me a bunch of texts and called me while I was asleep, and now he isn’t answering. The road is still washed out, so I can’t get out to him, could you?”

“No can do, I’m still in the tower, can’t leave for another few weeks, you’ll have to wait till they fix it, I heard something about it being done tomorrow.”

“Well, at least I’ll be in time for Christmas to go see him, I’m sure he’s just at a doctor or doing holiday prep or something,” I lied to myself to steel my nerves.

“Sure, I have a bit of smoke I have to go check out, text you when I make it back to the tower,” She left with that, not saying anything more.

I paced anxiously around for an hour or so before looking back down at the plant. Those sprigs, there were more of them, dozens that surrounded the plant, I gently swept them to the side until something caught my eye.

For a moment, I thought one was twitching, almost like a dead or dying fly, but my vision corrected itself, and yep, just a sprig.

I occupied myself with that almost enough not to hear the knocking on the door that startled me, not expecting it. Hoping it was Flynn to come get me or maybe Amy, I opened it, only to see a man I didn’t know in a high-vis vest and a white hard hat.

“Hey, I heard you were the only one out here,” he looked at me disinterestedly.

“Yeah, that’d be me,” I said, tense.

“Well, we probably aren’t gonna be able to stabilize the road for another week because of Christmas being tomorrow, but we cut a little road next to it if you want me to guide you through so you can leave,” he picked at his stubble while he spoke.

“Yeah, that sounds great actually,” I quickly ran inside to grab my last pack of things to stuff into my car, taking a last look at the shrub before leaving, a next sprig lying on the ground, darker than the others, but ignoring it and getting in my car.

It took about 20 minutes of leading to get to the cleared path, and I carefully threaded through it onto the main road, waving to the kind worker as I drove off, heading into the 2 to 3-hour drive to Flynn’s house to check on him.

I tried calling multiple times as I went every 20 minutes, but nothing went through, and anxiety and worry filled me as I got up his driveway. His house is tucked a bit into the woods, so I only actually say it once I was entirely up the mile-long driveway.

I got to the door and knocked, no answer, knocking again, once again, no answer. It was an eerie silence; nothing was going on in the house, which was strange for an active family.

I checked their carport, and there both of the family’s cars were, just sitting there, like they hadn’t moved in a week.

Deciding something was wrong, I went to their back door, which was mostly made of old, thin glass panes that I easily smashed and opened from the inside. I walked into the house, the air was still and dank like a greenhouse, making my way through the mudroom in the back to the kitchen.

The wet-wood smell got stronger as I went through the empty kitchen into the dining room, where I stood confused in the doorway for a moment.

A mass of wood sat at the head of the table, like old growth, but sitting still, top going no higher than my chest, with branches that extended into the table, my confusion left as I saw how a fork was placed into one of the branches, a branch that was darker than the rest, like it was years older, and a crack at the very end like a deep gash, Flynn.

Calming myself, I went further into the house, sat in front of the living room TV was another mass, smaller. I sat still, almost in a ball shape, with four branches, two that formed a loop touching the ground, and two more that connected in, a round, small, separate mass facing the TV that was cracked and static-y.

I moved further in, getting to Flynn and his wife’s bedroom, a third mass, smaller than the first but larger than the second, lay long on the bed, a noticeably lighter color than the other two.

I flinched as I heard something like labored breathing outside the room, running to where the children’s bedrooms were, seeing Flynn’s youngest on the bed, writhing.

“Hey Donny, it’s okay, it’s okay, I got you, we’re going to the hospital, it’s okay,” I scooped him up, pulling his head into my chest so he wouldn’t see the rest of the house, hoping to spare him from that at least.

“Where are my mommy and daddy? I haven’t seen them since yesterday. I couldn’t leave my bed,” he was openly crying into my shirt as I carried him.

“They’re okay, everything is gonna work out, alright?” I knew they were gone, I just wanted to save him if it was at all possible.

I loaded him into the back seat, buckling him into a lying position as I got into the driver's seat and began to drive. It was 45 minutes to the nearest hospital. I sped down the road, hearing his breathing grow harder and harder, his wiggling growing less and less audible. I was able to make the drive in 30 minutes, getting out and going to the back, and I saw it was too late.

Going to pick him up, he was stiff. His skin as hardened like sapling bark, locked into the fetal position in my back seat. I stopped myself, electing not to touch him, but went back to my driver's seat and just sat there. I caught my breath as a new text hit my phone. It was from Amy.

“Were they able to get you out? I got to stop by the cabin because a bit of smoke was over there, and you weren’t there. You owe me a Band-Aid for my kit by the way. I went to touch your stupid plant, and it cut [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/EldritchTales/).”
