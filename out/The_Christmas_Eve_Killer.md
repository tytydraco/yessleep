...Two Different Tales...

The Night Sammy Escaped

This Christmas Eve was dark and cold as Sammy escaped, the glitter on his face shone bright red against the moon light, he escaped prison as he did every year with the same goal in mind... To kill his parents. He took a long look at himself before entering into this world of darkness, he could see his reflection in a puddle of water that lay on the ground, he walked towards it and stared at his own reflection, he smiled then ran off into the night.

The cold air hit him like an iron wall, but he still kept running, he made his way to the main road where there were many people walking about, he slowed down when he heard the sound of footsteps behind him. It was Norman Watson, his father! "Come back Son!" He pleaded, gazing at the knife in Sammy's hand. "I love you."

Sammy didn't reply, anger bubbled inside of him. His face was now inflamed, and covered in itchy glitter. This would have never happened if he didn't spill it all over himself that day, his horrid sparkling face was what led him to insanity. And it just so happened to be on Christmas Eve,  14 years ago...

Rage was bubbling insideSamuel he clutched the knife in hand ready to kill his father. But first, he had a message for his mother. He stopped when he saw her, she was lying lifeless on the ground. She looked peaceful, her eyes closed, yet still open; he stepped closer to her to check if she was alright, and noticed the bloody knife in her back. He had killed her; and he didn't regret it. Murder was what he fed off of, it was what kept him alive. He was psycho!

He looked up at his father again, who was slowly making his way towards him with a teary eyed expression. "Please come home Son," he said, trying to grab hold of him. "You're my only child." Logic took over him, and he realized behind that red, glittery face, was a monster and not his only son. Sammy could very well speak but he chose not to reply. Police cars arrived ready to take him away, as he aimed the knife at his father ready to end his life once and for all.

"Son you can't do this!" Norman cried out, grabbing his wrist. "Please don't hurt me!" He held onto him tight as police officers entered the scene, grabbing Sammy by the arms and dragging him away from his father. Sammy broke free from the officers grasp, and nobody could find the Christmas Eve Killer. He was long gone, but he was a legend in this town.

The next day, the sun was shining brightly, it was Christmas day. People were finishing their last minute shopping and getting ready to celebrate tonight. The children were excited, and couldn't wait to open their presents this morning. 


Young Heather Harjayara came running down the stairs, like every child she was eager to open her presents. Under the lit Christmas tree was a neatly wrapped gift, adorned with a beautiful red bow! Strangely Heather's parents were nowhere in sight. She opened up her gift, and to her utter shock and horror, were the dead bodies of her parents.
In the box was a letter that read "From Sammy."


The Christmas Eve Killer: The Night Santa Comes, Is The Night Sammy Comes.

It was a chilly December evening and the snow had already started to fall. People were celebrating Christmas, an especially important day for Samuel Watson — better known as The Christmas Eve Killer. 


Sammy had once been a normal teenage boy, working in a purse factory. But when there was an explosion of red glitter, burning itself permanently onto his face, leaving his skin red, itchy, and inflamed, he went mad with rage. He could not control his temper — or his actions. 


And so it was that every year on Christmas Eve, Sammy found himself breaking out of prison to carry out his twisted plan: killing the one he considered most responsible for the tragedy that befell him — his father Norman. 


Armed with nothing but hate and determination, Sammy quietly stalked through town on that fateful night. His heavy boots barely left a sound as he weaved through alleyways and backyards in pursuit of his goal. His heart raced against time as he searched for some sign of Norman’s passing — something that would give up hope of achieving his vengeance at last.


But suddenly, Sammy stopped short in the middle of the street. A strange feeling filled his chest; something he hadn't felt in years. And then he saw him – Norman, standing in front of a store window wearing a Santa suit! How foolish of Sammy to think that even death could stop this man from spending time with family on Christmas Eve! 


In that moment, all of Sammy's anger melted away as if it had never existed. Remorse over his evil deeds, replaced hatred in its place and joy now surged within him like raging river wings did in the summer storms after long periods of drought. From then on, no matter what happened during the rest of the year - good or bad - Sammy vowed to spend each Christmas with Norman by his side - reminding them both how precious their relationship really is and how easily it can be taken away without us ever realizing it until it's too late..
