I’ve always been fascinated by the ocean, it covers most of the earth, yet we still don’t know what all lives there, that’s why I joined a research project by a company devoted to documenting sea life.



Me and my coworkers Cindy and Lance had been assigned to monitor an area in the Atlantic that the company believed was part of the migratory path of Basking sharks.



Our job consisted of dropping anchor in an area in the Atlantic, then lowering a camera down to observe the area and document any basking sharks passing through.



For the last three days, we witnessed 12 crabs, 32 fish, and 0 basking sharks. Lance made a remark about how we had the task of watching for the one camera-shy species of fish in the entire ocean.



That night Cindy and I were out on the deck looking at the now blackened seas when suddenly Lance shouted from the cabin.



“Cindy! Madison! Come look at this.”



We both ran over to the cabin, and Lance was pointing at the monitor.



“Right here.



Lance was pointing at something in the monitor, save for the light on the camera, everything else was black… except for what looked like faint light in the distance.



“What is that, Lance?”



Lance looked at the light again, then back at us.



“I don’t know, maybe it’s an ROV from another ship?



I almost considered it, but remembered this area was exclusive to our company.



“But we're supposed to be the only research vessel for 30 miles, could we check the archived footage of the three previous days? Maybe we can see when this thing started creeping over the horizon”.



“Way ahead of you Madison “

Lance went over to our second monitor and began scrubbing through the footage of each day until we got to this morning.



“And it started right here.”



Lance slowed the footage down. That's when the light began to crest over.



“And it's been coming this way ever since.”



The discussion about what to do boiled down to watching the live feed in Shifts to watch the light, because I suggested it, I was given first watch.



I watched the light grow slightly for about an hour, it went from being the size of a dime to a nickel, but I still couldn’t make out any new details from it. I tried to stay awake to watch further, but boredom is an effective sleep aid.



I woke up to see that the light was closer to the camera and larger,  before I could check the time, how long Id been asleep, that’s when I noticed something in the light, it looked like the silhouette of a man slowly walking in the sand.



I ran to get Cindy and Lance. They were dumbfounded when they saw the silhouette. Lance went on about how the man  couldn’t have stayed down there so long without equipment, and that the water pressure should have killed it. Cindy was more concerned about the glow it was giving off.



I looked back at the feed to see that the man had stopped walking and alerted Lance and Cindy of this.



We stared at the screen as the light around the man started to dim, then he turned his head to look right at our camera.



Lance was the first to realize what this meant.



“Someone go to the crane and pull the camera up!”



Before we could leave the cabin,  Cindy pointed out that the man had stopped looking at the camera and was walking away.



A moment of relief turned to terror as the boat suddenly bobbed, it had grabbed the anchor.



We all ran over to the stern, looking over the edge we saw that same orange light rapidly rising;,it was climbing up the anchor chain, somehow it could climb much faster than it could walk, within minutes, the light was only 10 feet away from us.



The growing orange light was followed by the water around the chain boiling, then as it was out to breach the surface,  we stumbled back as the man’s head came out of the water, steam coming off of it as the man climbed onto the boat.



What stood before us was a 7-foot humanoid figure, he was naked but had no genitals, and was built like a bodybuilder.



His skin resembled the color of burned wood, with lots of cracked, open wounds that had a faint orange glow emanating from them.



His eyes were a solid orange and also gave off a similar glow. We stared at the thing that had  just crawled up the anchor chain to our boat.



Cindy was the first one to say something to it.



“Hello?”



The man looked at Cindy. I swear the light inside him got brighter as he replied with a voice that was deep and sounded slightly distorted.



“Why were you watching me?”



We stared at the man, again, it looked like his body kept growing brighter. I tried to keep a neutral tone with my reply.



“Our apologies, we were out here to observe marine life that migrate in this area-“



“You come to watch me, I’ve seen your machine before, a giant black eye that comes down to observe me, then when I get close. it rises back up before I can catch it. This time you weren’t fast enough, again, I ask, why are you watching me?”



I didn’t know how to respond, none of us knew this thing existed, but apparently the company did, Lance tried to explain.



“Look, we didn’t even know you were here, other people have been paid to come to this area, and they were most likely told that this was to observe marine life as well.”



The man looked at Lance, its faint glow had become comparable to a lantern now.



“If you did not intend to watch me, then you will surrender your ship to me.



Cindy was the first to object.



“Listen, I know you're upset, but we can’t just give you our-“



Lance cut Cindy off



“We would be glad to, just give me a minute to get our life raft, and it’s all yours.”



I couldn’t believe what Lance had done, leaving us to die on a life raft while this thing got to keep our boat and go god knows where with it.



Cindy immediately objected.



“Lance! We can’t just give the ship to him!”



“Of course, we can, Cindy, this poor guy’s probably been walking across the ocean floor for a very long time.”



Lance walked into the cabin, leaving us with this thing. The glowing never stopped amplifying, but now I could see in the lights on the ship that actual heat was coming off of him as well. I worried that he could have been radioactive, while waiting for Lance, I felt compelled to ask this thing a question.



“Why were you walking across the ocean floor?”



The thing tilted its head before responding.



“My purpose is to arrive at the new land and destroy it, my only way of getting there is to walk. The boats of wood could not withstand me.”



As he continued, I finally noticed the smell of burning wood, I looked down and saw smoke coming out from under his feet.



“Where is your associate?”



Suddenly, Lance ran out with a harpoon gun.



“Right here!”



With that, Lance fired a harpoon at the man. It reacted to the projectile with incredible speed, it grabbed the harpoon, its body glow quickly changing from orange to yellow, then finally blue.



The cracks in its body opened further as fire started coming out of them.

The harpoon was now glowing bright orange, bending and melting in its hand, as it let the molten metal fall to the deck, it looked at Lance with rage.



“Humans never learn”



The man moved at a horrifying speed, grabbing Lance by the neck and taking him over to the starboard side.



The man’s fire diminished because it was now enveloping Lance.

We watched as he screamed and flailed in agony.



I was taken out of my trance by Cindy suddenly darting past me to get  into the cabin. I turned to see if the man had noticed, but he was still burning Lance alive.



Cindy came back out holding a fire extinguisher.



“Get to the crane controls! I’ll see if I can cool him down.”



I didn’t question Cindy’s suicidal plan, I just ran over to the controls and watched as she ran over to the man, who had just finished thoroughly burning Lance to death.



“Freeze fucker!”



Cindy proceeded to spray the man with the fire extinguisher, causing him to drop Lance's body into the water, while I moved the crane as fast as I could towards it.



Cindy ducked just as the arm of the crane struck the man, sending him into the water, his splash was followed by the area he was in steaming and bubbling.



I set the cable on the crane to retract while Cindy started raising the anchor so it couldn’t climb back up, after that we started up the motor and hauled ass back to the marina.



We were both pretty certain the company wouldn’t believe us, even with video footage and footprints burned onto the floor of the deck, when the time came to talk to our boss, he told us that the footage we’d gotten was excellent and that Lance’s accidental death was a tragedy.



The company had decided that Lance was trying to cook something in the cabin's small kitchen when an at the time unknown defect in the stove created an explosion that set Lance ablaze. He ran out, leaving a trail of burned footprints, and jumped overboard to put himself out.



I didn’t contest the narrative, and neither did Cindy, it was obvious that the company had dealt with this thing before, and no amount of contesting would make them even partially admit what really happened.



Shortly after, we were both let go as the research project was deemed “complete”.



I eventually did get a permanent job with another oceanic research company, and after a year the nightmares stopped.



I still think about the man walking across the ocean floor. I'm not sure where the “new land” he was referring to actually is, but every time I see news about fires breaking out in coastal towns, a chill runs down my spine.
