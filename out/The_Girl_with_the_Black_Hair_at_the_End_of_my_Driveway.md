The Girl with Black Hair

I had a dream last night that was so vivid and felt so real that I couldn’t ignore it or forget it. A girl with black hair kept showing up at my doorstep. It felt like there was a person in my dream that wanted to kill me. 

The first night she came it was dark i am at the top of my stairs of the house I currently live in, I can see the moon shining through the windows as I go down my stairs but I see someone probably in their early to mid twenties at my front door that is near the bottom of the steps. They are walking around like a crazy drug addict screaming and  acting like she was strung out on drugs except she looks fairly normal her hair is messed up but not terribly. I bang on my own doors and scream “get out of here”without opening my door hoping the noise would scare her off. She then gets angry and starts banging on my door and window near my door. I call up to my mother to call the police. The police arrive we have a short convo of me running down the events he says he will handle arresting her. 

The dream is moving really fast I look up the stairs and tell my mother to call the police I look back at the door and the police were there at my front door. The dream is very fast paced and I feel groggy and feel like I have sphagetti legs my hand eye coordination is just off I feel nerfed. 


My dream then returns back to me going down my stairs it is the afternoon of the next day the girl with black hair is outside at the end of my driveway sitting on the curb. I call the police this time telling them that she is on my property. Then as im watching her through my window I see her run across the street to construction on a new house. There are two workers in the garage she runs up sprinting at them the men evade holding up a sheet of drywall as a shield then ditching her and the drywall running away, well as they ran the police showed up and saw the altercation as they pulled up. She was immediately arrested. 
This is also when I noticed that my neighborhood looked different I was in my house but the houses were different and the town looked a bit older and had a lot of cracks and patch jobs on the road and the houses seemed older and unkept.


Now once again my dream jumps to me going down the stairs this time it’s about 2-3am the next morning. I reach the door look out the window and see her in a full wedding dress sitting on the curb at the end of my driveway. This sent chills running down my spine. How was she there again in the same spot She notices me quick and runs up to my door and bangs on it then walks around like a crazy person on drugs. She had this crazy look on her face and mascara running down her cheeks as if she had been crying. I yell to my mother she’s back!!!!!! Call the police. Police show up instantly again and this time tell me she is mentally challenged and isn’t harmful and that she’s is too crazy to be arrested. So they had just been released back into the custody of her family each time. Frustrated I accept it. 


Once again the next afternoon I am going down my stairs and see her sitting on the curb again this time I notice other people are outside trying to talk to her. I go outside to help as they are speaking and as I’m walking up she then darts about 2 houses down from mine and bangs on their door screaming and acting crazy. Cops show up and “arrest” her returning her home. All the neighbors are outside but here’s the thing these aren’t my real neighbors and they were all older people but we had a little meeting. We all agreed this was all too much for the community and we’re ready to get her in an institution or jail. 


It’s almost like when I have these discussions with the neighbors and police I feel disconnected like there scripted and I have no recollection of what was said but understand what the exchange of words meant or symbolized. But I felt differently when I was going down those steps and at my front door it felt so real.


My dream then jumps to me at the top of my stairs the next day. I go down the steps and the girl with black hair is sitting on the curb at the end of my driveway. She notices me and walks up rather calmly. That’s when I notice the girl is the most put together she had been so far she looked beautiful and her silky black hair was shinning. This time she just stands at my front door I tell my mother to stay upstairs and that I would call 911. 


I call and as I speak to the operator the girl forces open the door as it opens a crack I slam my shoulder into it and try to lock it. The lock doesn’t work she bangs on the door again it opens a crack but I hold it. I still feel groggy and off balance but I get my phone and call the police.I tell the operator the situation as I’m doing this. Then she hits it really hard and I stumble a bit and the door opens fully she stands there and is staring at me with a terrible grin cheek to cheek it just felt evil. She takes a couple steps in then I hear on the operator she’s mentally ill and is harmless. Looking into my soul her grin got wider and her eyes lit up when she heard the operator say that on the phone. She then backed up taking steps backward out the door and then turned around and walked away. 

It was as if she was playin a game and knew that everyone thought she was harmless but the way she looked at me was so threatening and evil. It was almost a message that she would be back like she always had been.

Everytime I saw her on that curb it was like seeing death especially when she was in the wedding gown. This girl with black hair felt like an entity within my dream the neighbors felt like normal people but she was different it was as if she knew me and was manipulating my dream. I know I’m leaving out certain details but I just had to write this down.
