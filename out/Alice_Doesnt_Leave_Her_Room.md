Her name was Alice.

*Alice.*

*A-L-I-C-E*

*A-LI-CE.*

A wonderful, noble name. It fit her like a glass slipper, fit her so beautifully that one couldn't deny it was made only for her. No one can ever share her name. They'll tarnish it, turn it unrecognizable, ruin her legacy.

*No person nor doll can have it. Her. No, no, none can.....*

Alice and I were close since childhood despite her status as the heiress of a wealthy family. Our lives were intertwined from the moment she smiled at me. She had smiled because I had offered her an apple, and I was hers. We grew closer and closer, until I was like her lover. We were inseparable, unbreakable, together forever.

*I remember when she stopped leaving her room. The sounds of her sobs.*

We went out one night to a party. Loud and crowded, it was a nightmare to enter. Booze stained the white walls, and art hung crookedly and was so ready to fall down and knock someone out. The other partygoers were drunk beyond reason, and dear Alice was growing uncomfortable from simply being in the house. I was forced away from her at some point, and my mind was too hazy to do anything right. I had left her for God knows how long.

*She never leaves her room. Never stops dreaming.*

Sweet Alice stayed away from everyone other than me. I fed her, stroked her hair, helped her bathe. She depended on me; I was the only one she trusted around her. She was so small and fragile, so pale and delicate to the touch. Red flowers bloomed on her bed, trapping her in their vines. Her blonde curls went flat, and her eyes grew dull.

*"Dull."*

She barely moves, barely eats or drinks. It takes everything in me to make her continue living. She's become hollow and despondent, a ghost trapped in her body.

Alice once danced with me in the gardens. The roses were no longer the most beautiful things there, for they had to compete with her smile. That smile....I will forever see it in my dreams. As for my nightmares, I still hear her silent accusations. All she does is stare at me.

*"Why didn't you help? I thought you loved me."*

She will never understand how much I love her. Everything I do is for her.

Just this past week, I sat with her and read a book. She stared at the pages, her lips parted ever so slightly. I brushed her hair out of her face and kissed her temple, but she didn't move. I lied her back down and put the blankets over her before leaving. It always pains me to leave, but I must. Her family finds my actions bizarre, but they understand how it helps.

*Who it helps.*

Again and again, I sit with her and read. Again and again, she stares at the pages. She never speaks, never breathes, never once tells me to find a different story. She only sits there and listens. She's such a good listener.

Alice once asked me about love, what it was and what it could be. I had no answer, and she laughed and poked me.  I fought back, and she kissed a rose and gave it to me. "For love," she had said with that divine smile. She was my princess, my love, my heart.

*I remember finding the roses in her room, the screaming, the pain and suffering. I remember her mother wailing like a mother who'd lost everything. The red roses sprouted from her wrists, their petals delicate and soft. The rosewater left an ugly stain on the blanket, just like the booze. She had never left her room.*

Alice had sung for me once, a bright and cheery tune that lifted my spirits. I had shyly asked her to sing again, but she didn't want to. Stubborn girl. It was only when she thought I had left did she sing once more, and I twirled to her birdsong.

  
*"Mike, Mike, stop," she'd whisper at night. "Mike, please, I said no. Stop! STOP!" I never asked who Mike was.*

  
Alice watched the birds outside, watched as the winter struck and took over with a vengeful hand. Rose petals dripped off her body.

*Alice wouldn't hear my screams, my pleas, my begs for her to stop. Rosewater covered me, pouring from her wrists, and I was unable to carry her to the bathroom. Unable to give her any sort of final dignity. I wailed as she grew limp, but she looked at the air and sighed. Sighed, sighed, sighed. She didn't smile or frown, she simply closed her eyes and left.* 

  
She's cold now. Smaller, too. She can fit on my lap so easily. She sits as I brush her hair and talk about my day, but she never speaks back.

  
She never leaves her room.
