We had to move on earlier than planned, and it cost us. Energy and time, two things we can't afford to waste. We've found somewhere else, a place hopefully far beneath the radar of what's hunting us. With any luck, we can score some food and rest. He's out... well, I can't tell you what Evan is doing right now. We're desperate. Exhausted but working on a plan It's  the only thing that has made me feel any amount of hope. We have to end this and I think we're close. Thank you for giving me a void to scream into; here's what came next.



I awoke in a small puddle of drool, looking underneath the stove. I focused on a bit of food here, some crumbs there, anything to beat back the fog of a mind that just blacked itself out. I could hear my video, still talking about how the West was colonized. I slowly pushed off the floor, arms shaking under my weight. When I sat up and looked down, I could see a whole outline of moisture from where I went down, covered in sweat. My hair stuck to my face, my clothes to my body. I trembled, grabbing the counter with a slick hand and clumsily getting to my feet. Dizziness followed the attempt, and I sat back down, resting my head in my hands. 



I sat there until the video ended, having no beginning or end in my head for thoughts appearing and dissolving like ghosts. The quiet pulled me from the dull drone that had become my brainspace and I realized I’d almost nodded off. I couldn’t sleep though, not yet. I tried to get up again, and this time, it felt easier. The world stayed steady under weak legs as I rose, still holding onto the counter just in case. I slowly moved towards the sink, and reached for a glass from the cupboard above it. I was sure to close it quietly, and filled it with water from the tap. I took one sip, then another, feeling the fog recede a little more. In its wake, I realized I was left with three choices. 1.) I could go get a hotel room until Evan gets back. Leave the creepy for later to get some sleep, and relax. 2.) I seek professional mental or medical intervention. This felt too real to be psychosis but that was by definition, a symptom of it. I wasn’t above a solid mental breakdown, and maybe the stress of a new job, and my boyfriend being away was the source. That left me with one other option: 3.) Gather more information about what was going on. Prove that I’m either insane or in danger. 



Looking back, I still feel like I should have understood what was happening earlier… I would have left the moment anything felt off. As it was, this was *my* home, and I was gonna be damned if anyone made me afraid within those walls. 



At that moment, all I could do was drink some water. To get a shower, and get back to work. I was so drained, I didn’t care that every time I moved my chair, something moved above me too. That a voice could be heard, reverberating through the floor now. It was three when I closed the laptop, briefly relishing the quiet that finally came about. I wasn’t sure if he’d gotten bored or tired too. I didn’t care. I numbly looked around my office, eyes freezing on something sitting atop my bookshelf. I felt the first spark of life since deciding to stay, it felt like a small way to fight back: headphones. I hadn’t thought of it before because sleeping could be hard enough even without them, but if this was going to be a daily occurrence, I didn’t have to participate in it. If I couldn’t hear him, it didn’t matter what he was doing up there. It wasn’t a permanent solution, but I could do it for four more days.



I grabbed them, paired them to my phone, and enjoyed a wonderfully normal evening. I felt movement through the floor here and there, but it was nothing. I wasn’t listening for footsteps. I wasn’t waiting to be followed. A small part of me knew it could still be going on… but I needed a break from caring. A break so thorough, I even slept in the headphones. I woke up the next morning feeling that unique sort of rested that makes you forget there’s anything else for a few moments. I rolled over, stretching and yawning away from the dim morning light coming in through the balcony window. 



*Not yet* I thought wistfully, turning onto my side… while scraping against that uncomfortable snow that first came in a dream. It felt like a thousand small pebbles in the bed, I sat up with confusion and disgust as my headphones fell back to the pillows. I turned on the lamp so harshly it almost fell, I squinted against the light, trying to assess the mess.



There was much more of a mess than the first time, it was all over the bed, on the floor, on my end table, in my hair, on my arms. I quietly got up, looking to the ceiling for answers; my stomach turned seeing the bare patches of popcorn coating running along most of the livingarea. It was in strips, almost like a poorly mowed lawn, leading around the kitchen wall towards the front door. 



I went cold.



Had I put up the security bar?



I moved around the bed quicker, ignoring the pointy white pieces of ceiling that stuck to my feet. My eyes immediately zeroed in on something near the door, white against the dark brown and completely out of place. Not taking my eyes off of it, I leaned over, turning on the kitchen light. 



It revealed shards of white glass, shattered in a relatively perfect circle on the floor, the pieces looked rounded and familiar even in their broken state. I slowly brought myself to look at the ceiling. The dome of the dining area light had fallen, leaving the bulb exposed. I felt my mind click and understand what it had to mean but I couldn’t think it. I pushed the thought away, running back around the bed to grab my phone. I came back with shaking hands, quickly snapping photos of the damage and mess. I wanted proof and I’d need it to find out what was going on. It wasn’t until I’d collected the evidence that I saw the security bar was still where I’d wedged it before I slept. My original idea came roaring back… I examined the ceiling again, looking for cracks, internally begging for them. Maybe this whole ceiling was about to collapse, or the upstairs neighbor had stomped all night. I examined closer, and felt those goosebumps all over again. There was nothing except the stumps of where the plaster had been. That sort of damage couldn’t be done through the floor.



A cool fog settled on my skin as I followed the trail towards a larger area of damage behind me. The path led to the balcony door. I looked down, chest heavy, my whole body shaking with dread. It was unlocked. 



I almost dropped my phone as I whipped out in front of me, barely catching it as the screen lit up. I hit the emergency call button, my thumb found the three magic numbers as I moved into the kitchen to avoid the shards threatening my bare feet.



 I had to fight the compulsion to freeze and stare as the darkness of the office caught my eye, I turned my back and swallowed a gasp, leaning against the kitchen wall. The realization crawled all over me.



He could still be here. 



The only way to know meant I'd have to reach around the doorway, and flick on the light in that room. I immediately decided I'd rather jump off of the roof two stories above. If I tried to call 911 right there and then, it could escalate this. Provoke him into an attack. I listened for anything, a breath, a creak as I tried to puzzle this. He'd hear me go to the front door, and removing the security bar would give him all the time he needed to make a move. I glanced towards the balcony door. I scrapped the idea immediately, he'd have a straight shot. I could lock the bathroom door, but I’d have to turn my back just long enough to get in there. From here, he couldn't know what I was doing.  One way in and out through the kitchen doorway, there was nowhere safer in the apartment if I could just buy time.



I raised my phone again, unlocking it and pulling up my contacts. I switched my attention between the screen and the now menacing dining area. I pulled up my neighbor Linda's contact, briefly grateful she needed a cat sitter once in a while. I trembled, typing out: *911 to me home intruder may still be here*. I didn't dare type more and hit send, gluing my eyes back to the entryway, fists clenching. It reminded me I was unarmed, followed by the thought: I didn't have to be. 



As silently as I could, I reached, and gently slid my largest knife from the block sitting on the counter. I winced at the sound of metal against wood, painfully aware of how unique the noise was. If he was listening, he knew.



It didn't matter. Linda was home as much as I was and addicted to mobile games. Help would be on the way soon. Until then, I had a knife. I felt my chest ache, silently begging the quiet to stay. *Don't make me use this, don't make me use this, don't make me use this....* Images of violent slashes, clawing hands, blood everywhere threatened to distract me, I blinked adjusting my grip on the handle. 



I wasn't sure how long I waited, coiled and ready to strike at anyone coming in. Each time I started to wonder, I shook the thought, knowing even the briefest lapse in focus could mean disaster. My only concern was to make it until help arrived. That resolve cemented my shaking legs in place, kept the aching fear from knocking me out again. I'm not even sure I blinked except for a handful of times. My heart alternated between rapid beats, and low, slow impacts radiating through my chest. I silently wished the sound of pumping blood in my ears would stop. I still needed to listen. The lunch horn from a nearby factory jolted me out of my watch. 



I risked a glance at the stove clock: 12:01. I'd been waiting for nearly two hours. I looked down at my phone, unlocking it. The home screen came up, and I saw I had a text. 



*Linda: Nice try.*



Um. What? I barely spoke to her except pleasantries and cat things, never even tried to joke with her, how on God's green Earth was she saying 'nice try'? I read it again and again. Looking back, I could have used that time to call the police. Instead, I was the dumbass in a horror movie, trying to rationalize the least important thing going on. 



A single creak was all it took to freeze my blood. I instinctively crouched a little, gut twisting. Another shift of weight made the floor groan again, sending me trembling, panting..... the sound did not come from above. It did not come from below, outside or the stairwell. 



It came from my office. 



Something in me snapped at that moment. How *dare* he. I had actually worried about this sorry sonofabitch! I was concerned because I thought after so many years in this dump, we had an understanding, one person each that we knew would not fuck around and make living here harder. We’d gone from that to…. Fuck, he was making me question the mind I’d worked tirelessly to set straight. To trust again. He turned my home, my head into his playground… and he was about to learn how dangerous that was. 



The fear once again fled in the adrenaline fueled rage taking over. It was my turn. I dialed 911, hit call and sat it down on the counter. With a war cry I charged out of the kitchen, grabbing the wall to turn the corner, knife outstretched I hurtled towards the darkness. I breached the doorway, slashing as I scrambled for the light switch, my fingers found it like a memory and flicked it on. 



Nothing. No one. It was just me, my unsteady knife and silence save for my heavy breathing. I moved, driven by the hunt coursing through me. I checked under the desk, in the closet. I was the only one in my home. I was grateful, and even more confused than before. I sat on the desk, lying the weapon down next to me. I put a shaking hand over my chest and closed my eyes, counting breaths to calm down. 



*BOOM!*



I cried out, plaster fell as the impact made the whole room shake. I grabbed the knife, turning around and looking up, backing out of the office as I screamed “GET BACK DOWN HERE YOU CREEPY BASTARD! THE POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY!” Another loud impact shook the hallway.



“YEAH YOU KNOW DAMN GOOD AND WELL WHAT I’LL DO WITH YOU!” I screeched, sounding insane as my hand started removing the security bar from the door on its own. I glanced down, pulling the strap from over the top of the knob, kicking the bottom foot of it out from underneath and off to the side. I unlocked the deadbolt with a victorious click, ripping the door open.



“FUCK YOU!” Was my parting phrase as I stepped onto the carpeted landing, slamming it shut behind me, my bare feet padded down the cold stairs of their own accord. When I got to the bottom, I turned back around, and looked up at the window just above my own, somehow knowing he would be there.



He was. Some of him was, anyway. I could make out the bill of his ratty blue ballcap pressed against the window. My breath caught staring into the two milky white orbs glowing underneath it. There was just enough light from them to make out a gaping smile, surrounded by shredded bloody flesh where lips should be. Long talon-like teeth jutted out between the strips of raw skin in impossible numbers. None of it made sense to my mind, but my body knew enough to send my pulse racing again, palms sweating, limbs buzzing. I couldn’t look away, and whatever was living above me didn’t either. 



That was the first time I felt how truly afraid I should have been all along. I could feel the pieces fall in and out of place, trying to create how each moment was tied to the evil I was looking at. We stared, I memorized every line of its deformed face, forgetting about the knife, the freezing concrete, it seemed like the whole world went quiet as I absorbed what a demon might look like. Or a vampire, something beyond our realm had pushed me to this point and I wanted to fix this picture in my mind. Because I knew the moment I looked away, I’d be filled with doubt. 



“Ma’am. Put down the knife.”



I blinked, and the thing was gone. The window was empty. I felt dazed as my eyes wandered to the source of the voice. Two uniformed police officers had me at gunpoint; I could see a neighbor far behind them with their dog, watching. It was enough to pull me back to where I was. Reminded me my phone was probably still on a 911 call. I raised my left hand, and slowly lowered my right, letting the knife down to the sidewalk as gently as my shaking hand could.



“I called, someone broke into my house.”



“Back away from the weapon.” 



I nodded, suddenly conscious of how my toes were starting to hurt, how my muscles ached. I backed away, hands still raised. The officer in front, no older than myself warily approached, kicking the knife off to the side. He had short blonde hair and blue eyes that were wide and alert, daring me to make a move. I knew they were just doing their job, and being a barefoot knife-wielding stranger with bedhead, did not make a great case for my credibility. It didn’t keep the despair from sinking in.



“Please,” I begged quietly, lip quivering as the horror of the last couple of hours started to take its toll. “I can show you inside, someone was in my home. Th-the light’s broken, there’s pieces of my friggin ceiling everywhere, I think it was that th–” I stopped myself. No. Not yet. “The upstairs neighbor. I need help.” The other officer stepped forward, keying his radio:



“Dispatch, are you still on the line with the Landing call?” He was an older gentleman with a bit of a belly, dark hair and eyes that looked like they’d seen their share of life.



“Yes, I think the caller left the scene.” 



“Which apartment is yours?” He asked, his eyes crinkling as he looked up the stairwell. 



“Just above the first flight, sir.” Relief and hope started to leak in; they were taking me seriously. I shifted my increasingly frozen feet, catching the nearest officer’s eye. 



“I’m not moving, my feet just hurt,” I said quickly. He nodded as his partner gave three sharp knocks. He keyed his radio again. “Dispatch, are you hearing anything?”



“Three knocks.”



“Copy, that’s us, we'll take it from here.” he said, nodding at his partner who immediately relaxed. He bent down, picking up the knife. 



“Did you have to use this?”



“No sir.”



The older officer waved me forward. My feet were nearly numb, making my trip back up the stairs a bit clumsy in my rush. I welcomed the carpeted floor, ready to hide in the house when the younger one took my arm.



“Let us clear it first, then we’ll get you inside.” I nodded vigorously, feeling the chilliness sink in all over. I hugged myself as they disappeared into the apartment. I looked around, tired with relief. It wasn’t just me now. I wasn’t sure how I might explain that something else entirely broke into my place, but they could get evidence, go upstairs and…. With a jolt I realized I had to talk crazy or they might get hurt. They didn’t have to believe me but I didn’t know what that damn thing could do, they could be in danger. I stepped towards my front door when it opened. 



“Come on in, Miss.” The older officer moved, letting me in and I stepped so I wouldn’t walk over the broken light fixture… that was no longer there. My eyes scanned the floor, heart thumping for any trace of the plaster that had been everywhere. I looked up, the light was in place and whole, the ceiling was as textured as ever, tears welled up as my eyes wandered to the balcony door. Locked. I looked at the younger police officer, who wasn’t quite meeting my eyes.



“What’s your name kiddo?” I turned around, knowing what that tone meant. It was heavy and gentle, the kind you used with a sick person. I didn’t know what to do, how everything I stared at for two hours could vanish.



“Miranda Nollins.”



“I’m Officer Gedrick. Do you have any medical conditions we should know about?” I shook my head, ready to fight how this looked.



“I have pictures on my phone,” I dove into the kitchen, grabbing the device and unlocking it. There were three missed calls from Evan, which I’d have to see to soon. I opened up the phone gallery.



The proof I was ready to show them was a black screen. My mouth moved but I couldn’t find words. I looked up at them, feeling helpless. Officer Gedrick moved to stand next to me, looking down at the photos. His head tilted. 



“What time were these taken?” I clicked the menu icon, then details, angling the screen towards him.



“Where’s the time stamp?” He murmured. He looked into my eyes and I felt an intensity there. A warning.



“I don’t know sir.” He moved slowly away, rubbing his chin. 



“Would you mind taking a seat so we can talk?” I nodded numbly, feeling hollowed out and full of devastation all at once. I sat on the edge of my bed, feeling hope leak out of me by the second. The older man pulled up a dining chair and sat in front of me. 



“This is my partner, Officer Palmer. Before we do anything else, I want to know how you ended up outside.” My mouth suddenly felt dry. I had no proof and they had no reason to believe a word. Even so, I didn’t have anything else to offer except my experience. I looked between them, deciding that if I was insane, at least I was *actually* safe. 



I gave them the whole story; from the beginning to this afternoon, it came out in a torrent. I wiped my face of the tears that kept falling as I finally explained how I ran out of the house. I fell silent, waiting for more questions. I looked up and saw that Officer Palmer felt more sympathy than belief in what I was saying. Officer Gedrick’s face had turned to stone, and I wanted to shrink, disappear and dissolve. He stiffly got up, turning to his younger counterpart. “Let’s go, Palmer. We’ll chalk this up to a sleepwalking nightmare or something.”



“What?” I was immediately embarrassed at how whiny it sounded, I cleared my throat and tried again, following them. “That’s it?” You’re not gonna check upstairs, maybe take–”



“Ma’am, we’re doing you a service,” Gedrick said sharply, leaving me and the younger officer dumbfounded.

 

“They’d drag you off to the hospital if we take this further.” I met his gaze… and saw that intensity again. That warning. 



“I…” I looked at Palmer, who was adjusting his gear. 



“We’ll send a social worker next time we hear from you, understand?”  



“Okay?”



“In the meantime, maybe go online, look up your symptoms and seek other kinds of help. Filing a false report is illegal, mental health intervention is not.” They left without another word. 



Tears came again. I couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening, what wasn’t happening. What any of it meant. I didn’t understand. I looked around at my perfectly tidy home. Listened to the quiet. I stayed like that until the last of my adrenaline dwindled, leaving me exhausted. I wanted to sleep… but if I woke up covered in plaster again, I would actually lose my mind. So I grabbed a pillow, a blanket, and my phone. I crawled under my bed, the frame was high enough to comfortably lie down. I curled up. Resigned and numb to Evan calling, again. I watched it ring, eyelids fluttering. Then darkness.
