You ever drive around and surf through the radio broadcasts in an area? Probably not right? I wouldn't blame you, usually you're met with a station that plays two songs for every ten ads, a political station taking an hour to tell you a story you could read online in 15 minutes, or static. It's kinda sad in retrospect, I remember growing up listening to whatever my mom would play driving around on her way to drop me off at school or swimteam practice. The thing is, once I got a phone and access to a streaming service, radio kind of faded out of my life.



I guess that's a strange way to start a story, but I can't really figure out where to start when talking about this. For clarification, I didn't want to share this, but my friend Collin told me that people here might know something, and he also thinks it will help me if I get it off my chest; Now my friends bailed on me to go to the bars and I have nothing else to do tonight, so I might as well write this up. 

Also for me and my friends privacy, and the privacy of their families, all of the names in this post are made up. I just don't feel right name dropping them. I hope you understand. 

It happened a few years back when I went on a camping trip in the \[Not saying the name\] mountains with some college friends. We had spent a few weeks trying to figure out what we wanted to do and Brandon told us he knew a pretty good camping spot his family used to go to. He told us it was remote, in a safe area, and none of the park rangers gave a shit if you drank. It seemed like a no brainer for a bunch of college kids who just wanted to get wasted. So me and Brandon got all the details sorted and we got our friends John, Max and Sam to come with us. 

  
I'm not gonna spend a ton of time detailing how we got there or what we brought because most of it isn't super important; the only things of note is the campsite was about a mile into the woods, John had brought a portable radio because he's a dork and thought it'd be fun, and I brought 48 coors lite's. 

  
By the time we got to the campsite it was about eight, and it was starting to get dark. We didn't want to waste time so we got our three tents set up. The campsite was pretty big so the tents were spaced pretty far apart and we organized them around the firepit. After an hour of us struggling. we finally succeeded in getting some fairly straightforward tents set up, we laid back and watched Sam use his "survival instincts" (or as I like to say, almost an entire bottle of lighter fluid) to get a fire going. The next few hours were pretty standard; we go drunk. We drank 24 beers; I had about three, John had two, Max had fourteen, Brandon had one and Sam had six.

  
Once Max started feeling the obscene amount he drank in around two hours, he started going on some rant about the movie Pitch Perfect. I'll try and write down what I remember

**Max**: I really don't care what y'all think, Pitch Perfect is a top five movie, hands down. 



**John**: That's crazy talk

  
**Sam**: Max, dude. The movie looks like a hallmark movie. You're tripping. 

  
Brandon was cackling in the back, he couldn't believe Max was trying to make a case for the movie. 

  
**Max**: Guy's. It's a movie about a bunch of hot girls with amazing voices singing. Let the record state that I believe Anna Kendrick is beautiful. 

  
**Brandon**: Dude, we aren't disagreeing on that, but them being able to sing doesn't make that movie amazing

  
**Max**: Yes it does, because as EVERYONE (Burps) knows, singing makes anyone more attractive. 

  
**Sam**: Poor choice of words dipshit

  
Sam got up mocking Max, and pulled out a bra from his bag and threw it to Max, while simultaneously gesturing to John to turn on the radio. 

  
**Max**: Why do you have a bra

  
**Sam**: Don't ask questions, just put it on and start singing to whatever's on the radio. If you can make all of us think you're attractive after your done singing, we'll concede. 

  
Max was drunk. He started screaming the lyrics to the music for about thirty minutes. It might of been one of the funniest things I've ever seen. 

  
Of course, after every few songs, John would have to switch to a new channel because ads would start playing, but he was pretty fast at it so Max had a pretty long streak of singing without stopping. Or at least he did until John stopped on a specific station

  
John stopped after he reached a glaring static. We all started booing him telling him to change the station. 

  
**John**: Hold on, listen

  
After a few seconds, we started to hear the static go away and heard what John was telling us to listen to. For some reason once we heard the guys voice we all fell silent. He was the most uncharismatic Radio Host You would have ever heard. He spoke in a monotone voice that sounded like he was high as a kite. I mean the stuff he was saying was also so stupid. He would say "The trees in the \[Not saying the name\] mountains are once again, still made out of wood", "This just in, the fish in the river are still swimming", or my personal favorite "Y'all are still listening to the radio". 

  
**Sam**: Well Mr. Host we're about to stop don't worry

  
Sam had said it with a drunken shit eating grin and started to walk over to the radio so he could turn it off. The crazy thing is, once he began to walk over the hosts tone changed. It became suave and full of life as he said "Time for my favorite part of the show, Calls from the campers!" as he let a caller join the line. 

  
**Host**: Howdy Caller! Can the viewers get your name?

  
**Caller**: Samantha

  
**Host**: Well Samantha, everyone listening into RottWood Radio are glad to have a pretty sounding young lady ask us a question. What might you be asking us today?

  
**Caller**: I'm at \[I'm not gonna say the name of the campsite\] and there's these five obnoxious college students. What should I do to shut them up? 

We all looked at each other and jokingly gestured that it might be us she was talking about. We starting pointing fingers saying it was Max that was causing a scene and started laughing at him. Max started stumbling around saying it wasn't him, drunkinly throwing his hands in the air saying he's innocent. 

  
**Host**: Well what are they doing that's causing a scene?

  
**Caller**: Well it started after one of them started talking about the movie Pitch Perfect

  
We all stopped laughing

  
**Caller**: I mean one of them, the one who drank like fourteen beers, was saying if a woman can sing she's suddenly hot?

  
**Host**: Well you certainly have a pretty voice so I'm sure by his logic your gorgeous

  
**Caller**: Well once upon a time I was, until a few years ago. 

  
**Host**: What do you mean?

  
**Caller**: Well, I won't go into to much detail but a few years ago while I was camping around here I got attacked and violated by a camper. After he was done with me he took a big ol rock and smashed it on my head. Even if my family had found me in time, a hospital wasn't gonna do much for a girl with a split open head with her eyes popping out. 

  
We were all listening. Me and Brandon stared at each other, in disbelief. 

  
**Brandon**: Ok this has gotta be a joke, someone probably overheard us listening to the station, got mad at us for being loud and they're trying to freak us out. 

  
**Caller**: Get a load of this, now they're talking over you

  
**Host**: Well that just isn't polite of them. You still got that rock that killed you?

  
**Caller**: Course I do

  
**Host**: Well I would go over there and take that rock, and bash it into one of their heads. That'll shut up those boys real good. 

  
**Caller**: What a wonderful idea! and I can wait until those boys go to bed so that I can maybe get few of them. They got three tents so I could sneak into one of the ones that has two of them in it and leave a pretty little scene for the rest to wake up to!

**John**: Guys, this is a prank right? Which one of y'all set this up? Be honest, it's not funny anymore



We were all silent.

  
**Caller**: Now they think I'm messing with them! Almost as if they don't think I'll do it

  
**Host**: Here's what I would do, I would take that rock, and bang it against the tree. Let those young men know you're there, so they know you're not messing with them. That way you can build a relationship of trust. Let them know that they can go to sleep so you can work your magic on them!

  
**Caller**: What a wonderful Idea!

  
A few moments passed, and then we heard the sound of about 30 yards into the forest. It was the repeated crash of something against a tree. We could hear the trees leaves rustling. We knew she was in the forest, listening to us, watching us. 

  
**Host:** They notice you yet? 

  
**Caller**: They're looking right at me! Or at least in my direction. If they saw me they'd probably be a little more scared, I ain't easy on the eyes

  
The Host and the Caller started cackling. We could hear the laughter from the forest and the radio. 

  
Me and Brandon looked at each other, then glared at the group

  
**Me**: Let's get the fuck out of here

  
**Max**: Dude taking down the tents would be a pain. Plus, so what if one girl comes over here. Is she gonna overpower all five of us? Come on

  
Max was still drunk, but he seemed to be forcing a laugh. It was like he was refusing to believe what he was hearing. 

  
**Caller**: Well now they want to go and run away!

  
**Host**: Well don't let them! Run into their camp, Don't let them get away! 

  
We heard the sound of the Callers footsteps begin to get faster and as she got closer we began to hear labored breathing and a vile laugh approach us. 

  
**Brandon**: No, fuck this. Get to the cars, we can get our shit in the morning. We're leaving.

  
He grabbed Brandon and began running. At this point we all followed suit. We had our phones and keys on us so we didn't stay in the camp even for a second, but we left the radio. The trail back to our cars was pretty straight forward, but the entire time we heard that girl running towards us. Behind us, following us like a beast, was a malicious laugh which sent a shiver through my body. 

  
We got back to our cars. Brandon and I threw Max into my Corolla as fast as we could and drove away as fast as we could; Sam and John were right behind us in a red Ford Pickup. We drove for an hour until we got to a motel. We checked in, locked the door, and moved all of the chairs in front of the door. We didn't get much sleep that night, but as the sun began to come up, we felt a little bit safer, so we all passed out for a few hours. 

  
Listen, I know that sounds ridiculous, Why would we be scared of one person? Well you didn't hear the broadcast. The way they talked about killing us, like it was nothing. The way she laughed, the way she breathed, even the sound of her shuffled run. It wasn't right. None of it was. 

Then we had to go back. We had to because the dumbass Max had dropped his wallet, which for some reason had two hundred dollars in it. 



**Sam**: Why. Why did you bring two hundred dollars cash with you. 

**Max**: I always keep cash on me man. My dad always tells me to

**Sam**: I ain't going back to the campsite 

**Brandon**: It's fine. Me and Joe can go with him, y'all can stay here.

 

Of course I got stuck with camp duty. Just my luck. That seemed to appease John and Sam though so we went back. We got to the campsite and everything was just the same as it was the night before. Except for two things.  

  
All of the tents had been opened up, the radio wasn't there, and a heart had been drawn on the ground. The heart was drawn around the campfire, and just like you would see on trees, our initials inside of it. J+B+S+M+J+S. Max found his wallet also inside the heart and went to pick it up.

  
**Max**: Shit, the money's not in here. 

  
**Me**: You're kidding

  
I gave him a look of disbelief and began laughing. 

  
**Me**: Sam's never gonna let us here the end of this. 

  
We drove back, and once we got cell service we tried calling the other two but they didn't answer. I sent them a text basically saying "Hey stay in the room, we're about twenty minutes out". We got a response right away saying saying "Ok". That should have been it. It wasn't. 

We got back and the door to our room was open. Brandon was the first to go in, but he was confused. No one was in there. No sign of them, but their car was still outside. I tried calling them again and I got an answer. I wish I didn't. All I heard was labored breathing, and a malicious cackle. Suddenly we heard a static from outside. We ran out and found John's Radio. 



**Host**: This has been RottWood Radio, thanks for tuning in. Remember, if you want to call, you know our number and if you don't, you know to find out. If you don't know how? You will eventually. 

  
**Max**: Guys, look. 

  
It was his money. It was stuck in-between the windshield and the windshield wiper of truck, and crashed into the windshield of the truck was a rock the size of a skull covered in dried blood. We never heard from John or Sam again. The cops never found anything. Search parties came up with nothing. I still hope they're ok, but I know they aren't. 

  
I'm not on speaking terms with the other two. I see Brandon in some of my classes, and my sister has pressured me into trying to mend our friendship. I wish I could, but we all feel guilty. Guilty for planning the trip and then for leaving them alone in the motel. We should of forced them to come with us. We knew that we were being followed. Yeah. obviously it should of been impossible for her to follow us, but the entire situation was so weird we shouldn't have disregarded the possibility. 



Anyways, I should also note I still have John's radio. I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about going back from time to time, seeing if RottWood Radio is still a thing. Finding the Caller and finding out where Sam and John are. I know it's a bad idea but it's been eating at me for years, I can't get it out of my mind. They were some of my closest friends and they just vanished. I feel like I'll never move on if I don't get answers. 

  
I'm glad Collin had me do this. Even if no one enjoyed it, it was good for me. I think I'm gonna try and find that station again. I need to find the number and call it, The Host did say if you didn't know the number, you'd find it. Maybe the locals know something about it. I don't know. I think I'll start by asking Brandon since he was the one who knew the campsite from the start. Hopefully he'll talk to me.
