I’m not going to tell you my name. If you recognize the way I talk from my old videos, keep it to yourself. I don’t want any more messages. I don’t want any more theories. I just need to get this out, and then I’m done with social media.

Back in 2017, I was a YouTuber. Not a huge one, but I pulled in good numbers—hundreds of thousands of views, sometimes millions. If you were watching overnight challenges, urban exploration, or anything that involved sneaking into abandoned places, you might have seen my videos.

It was all fake. That’s what I want you to believe. That’s what I need you to believe.

I was always careful. I planned every video like a heist. Research, entry points, escape routes. But in May of 2017, I got cocky. I wanted something bigger. Something that would go viral.

“24 Hours in an Abandoned Mall”—it sounded perfect.

I found the Cove Plaza Shopping Mall. Closed in 2013, mostly intact. No official security, just a few cameras that didn’t work. I brought my gear—a flashlight, night vision camera, some food, and a battery pack. I was ready. At least I thought I was

I got in through a service door. The inside was exactly what I wanted: dust-covered tile floors, shattered skylights, and dead silence. I started filming immediately, playing up the creep factor.

And then I saw them. Mannequins. Not just a few-hundreds.

Stores that had been picked clean still had them. Naked, broken, posed in unnatural ways. Some with missing limbs, others vandalized. A few were arranged in groups, like they were mid-conversation.

I joked about it on camera. Something about how this was the real mannequin challenge. I even moved a few, positioning them in weirder poses for later shots.

I shouldn’t have touched them.

By 2 AM, I was settled in the food court. The air smelled stale, like old grease and mold. I was filming a menu which was still lit up when I heard footsteps. Not the echo of my own—someone else’s.

I killed my light.

Silence.

Then, a faint plastic scrape.

I turned my camera toward the sound, slowly raising the brightness.

The mannequins had moved.

Not a lot, just a few inches. But I knew where they’d been before. I checked the footage—one near the escalator had its arms at its sides an three hours ago. Now, one hand was reaching forward.

I laughed. I was nervous, but I convinced myself it was nothing. Maybe I bumped it earlier. Maybe my memory was bad.

I went back to filming.

At 3:15 AM, my camera shut off.

The battery was charged. It shouldn’t have died. I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. The mannequins were closer.

The one by the escalator was now on the first step.

I don’t remember getting up. I don’t remember running. One second I was sitting, and the next I was at the other end of the food court, panting like I’d just sprinted a mile.

I wasn’t alone anymore.

Something moved in my peripheral vision. A head turned.

Plastic slammed the ground.

I bolted.

I didn’t look back. I didn’t stop filming, not until I was outside, gasping for breath. My camera was still dead, but my phone had the footage.

I never uploaded it.

When I checked the files the next day, they were corrupted. Every single one. The only thing that remained was a still frame from the food court—a blurry shot of me, sitting on the floor.

And something behind me.

A mannequin. No head. No arms. Just standing there.

I never went back.

I stopped making videos. My channel died. Maybe that was for the best.

I don’t care if you believe me. Just don’t go looking for Cove Plaza.

They don’t like being watched.
