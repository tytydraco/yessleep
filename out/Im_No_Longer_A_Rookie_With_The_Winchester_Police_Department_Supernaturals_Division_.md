I know Beth hates to see me coming.

Yes, I finally decided to stop gatekeeping my therapist’s name. Just calling her “my therapist” was getting pretty old.

If you’re new, you can read what I’ve been covering in my therapy sessions: [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/comments/1gpe8cd/guide_to_im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police/)

And with the shit-show the last day has been, I’m *definitely* overdue for one.

“Calm down,” I instructed Sage through the phone, “take deep breaths. Are you able to come down to the station?”

She let out an incredulous laugh, ignoring my advice. “Are you *nuts?* You want me to lead this psycho right to you while he’s following me and know I’m on to him? He’d kill me before I got the chance!”

Dustin rolled his eyes, continuing to apply pressure on my wrist. For such a small cut it was bleeding a lot. Must’ve nicked an artery pretty good.

I sighed, partially out of breath from the blood loss. “What’s your twenty?”

“My what?” Ms. Walker’s voice sounded very confused over the phone.

“Sorry,” I mumbled under my breath. Forgot I was talking to a civilian for a second there. Dustin shot me a stern look as he pressed his lips into a thin line, the pressure around my wound increasing. I winced. He was not very happy with me in that moment. “What’s your location? Where are you?”

“Oh,” she said understandingly, “I’m at the Old Brooks Motel on the edge of town.”

I motioned for Dustin to start walking for the parking lot, it would take us about fifteen minutes to get over there if we sped and had the lights on. After one last peek into the interrogation room, I followed after him.

What I saw in there is now burned into the back of my eyelids. Rudy’s eyes were glowing red and bloodshot, seemingly trained on me, disturbingly full of this primal hunger and lust. For what, I could only guess.

“Okay, Sage I need you to be very careful,” I spoke into my phone, shaking those eyes out of my head. They looked too familiar and I couldn’t deal with the memories associated with them.

I pushed the side door to the precinct open, squinting at light of the early afternoon sun. “My partner and I are on the way to you now,”the passenger and driver’s side door of the liftback slammed shut synchronously. Dustin tuned the key in the ignition, causing the old hunk of junk to roar to life. “We have the man you described in custody, so whoever is out there with you is not him. Find somewhere safe and stay put. Whatever you do, stay on the line.”

A tense moment of silence passed as she registered my words. “Wha-?“ she started to say, but then the most chilling, blood-curdling, scream I’ve ever had the displeasure of hearing erupted into my eardrums.

My heart sank into my stomach as the call abruptly ended. I looked over to my partner with worry, clutching my pounding chest. Dustin nodded, pushing the petal to the metal.

It took approximately eleven minutes for us to get to the Old Brooks Motel from the station, with Dustin managing to shave off a whole four minutes from what I projected. Four minutes that could be the difference between life and death.

Two cars occupied the gravel parking lot when we arrived. Winchester is one of those towns tourists typically drive through, not spend the night in. Meaning, the motel rarely saw any business. With how run down the place was, I wouldn’t want to spend the night there either. The building’s white paint was chipped and yellow from years of neglected upkeep. The railings were rickety at best, shoddy at worst. Most of the chain locks on the doors didn’t work, if they had locks at all.

In all honesty, it wouldn’t be surprising if the serial killer really was hanging around over here.

After parking, Dustin scanned the desolate parking lot for any signs that could tell us what went down here. Before getting out of the car he gave me a once over. Suddenly, he slammed his fist on top of the dashboard. The glove compartment popped open, revealing a treasure trove of random items. Among them was a thick roll of white medical gauze. “Wrap that up,” he ordered, pointing at his jacket that was still wrapped around my arm. “There might be a cookie or something in there too. Eat it and stay here while I check things out,”Dustin then slammed his door. I watched him walk into the reception office as my mouth hung open.

He was really pissed with me. Looking back at it now, what I did *was* pretty dumb and reckless. He had every right to be cross with me. After properly bandaging myself up, I tossed the bloodied police jacket in the back seat, making a mental note to get it dry cleaned for him. It was the least I could do after all.

Rummaging around the glove compartment, I found a couple stale fortune cookies. Doing as Dustin said, I cracked and ate both of them. One was fortune-less. The other read:

*An unsettling truth approaches; trust the whispers of your intuition.*

I shrugged my shoulders, tossing the scrap of paper into the open compartment before shutting it, doing my best to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach.

A few minutes later Detective Davidson returned to the car. “Found this,” he said, showing me a cracked iPhone. “And a body.”

I perked up in my seat, giving him a look.

“Relax, I don’t think it’s hers. The house keeper was stuffed behind the front desk, throat torn out.”

I lifted an eyebrow curiously. “Where’s the manager?”

“Let’s find out, shall we?” He said, a bleak smile forming on his lips.

It didn’t take us long to find the motel manager. He’s not the serial killer if that’s what you’re thinking. No, after a little investigating we found his foot sticking out of an ajar door on the first floor.

“You better call forensics,” I said, shoving my nose into my elbow to escape from the heavy metallic scent. Dustin did the same before stepping out to make the phone call.

The hotel manager’s skin was gaunt and pale, presumably due to the puddle of blood he was lying in. This kill was brutal and messy, much like the other ones. Only there was something different. This kill seemed to have been done out of impatience. I could see tell by the manager’s expression. You could see the other vic’s knew what was going on. They experienced their murder, we’re alive for their last moments. The manager though, his face was calm, peaceful almost. Like he had no idea that death was waiting for him.

Another body laid on the bed closest to the back wall. It was another man, more decayed than the manager. A wooden stake stuck out of hit chest like a gnarly splinter. His throat had been ripped out as well. The body was so bloated I couldn’t really tell much else. If the body wasn’t dust by now, that meant he’d been staked as a preventative measure.

Something about this was starting to feel off. I think deep down I realized it back at the precinct. This constant nagging feeling had been gnawing at the back of my mind ever since that phone call. If Rudy wasn’t our killer, then who was?

The only way to answer that question was to investigate the scene of the crime.

“Nobody else is here and Forensics is on the way,” Dustin announced as he re-entered the room, stepping around the body,” so is the coroner.”

I nodded solemnly as he tossed me a pair of latex gloves. I slipped them on and the two of us began snooping around, looking for anything that might tell us where Sage could’ve been taken.

The room looked like a standard motel room. Mini fridge, tv, dresser, and two queen beds. The room was mostly tidy, except for the blood and bodies. The sheets on the empty bed were strewn about and wrinkled, drenched in dark fluids. An old shoe box sat neatly on the end. The wicker doors of the closet had been pushed open, revealing its contents. Besides hanging clothes, pictures and news paper clippings were pinned to the back wall. A red string connected the different photographs and articles together like one big makeshift suspect board.

Upon closer examination, most of the clothes seemed to be some kind of costumes or disguises. The wardrobe ranged from fancy suits to clergymen outfits, even police uniforms.

Dustin tipped over the shoe box while I traced my finger against the red string, trying to piece together the same puzzle the owner of the string was.

“Jesus,” he muttered, causing me to turn my attention away. Dustin stood at the edge of the bodiless bed with his hand resting on his hips, chewing the skin off his lips as he thought.

Different state IDs, driver’s licenses, social security cards, and even some law enforcement badges had been living in that box. I took a closer look at them, they were all fake but could pass as real to the untrained eye. Different names were plastered on each of the identifying cards but the photos remained the same. They were all pictures of Rudy.

“Just who is this guy?” I asked aloud, scratching the side of my head.

“He’s a monster hunter,” Jane explained when we got back to the precinct. Davidson and I had just finished debriefing her on everything we found at the motel.

I scrunched my nose at the title. I’d heard of hunters before but never encountered one in real life. In my opinion they were idiots, taking the law of the land into their own hands- playing judge, jury, and executioner. Both human and supernatural laws were set in place for a reason. People that think they’re above them and The Court were messing with fire and putting themselves in needless peril.

Memories of Rudy filtered through my mind. The last thing on my mind when I thought of was *monster hunter*. He didn’t really look like the type to be a revenant either, but here we are.

“He wasn’t alone, either,” Dustin said, tossing a photo he took from his pocket in front of Jane and I.

“Dustin!” I gasped, my eyes widening in shock. “You took something from a crime scene?!”

He scoffed incredulously. “You really want to lecture *me* on protocol right now?”

I stuttered for a second, trying to think of a comeback, but ultimately stood there. Flustered

“Go ahead Jane, why don’t you ask Lucky about those bandages on her wrist?” Dustin goaded, crossing his arms into his chest.

“We can unpack all of *that* later,” Jane said, turning to the two of us and motioning her hands in circles. “But right now, we need to focus on this.” Her well manicured nail tapped on the photo Dustin had taken.

“Hey, that’s the dead guy we found on the bed,” I pointed out, examining the photo. It was a Polaroid of three dudes in a bar. I recognized the white man’s dirty blonde hair. He stood on the left side, drunkenly smiling. On the right was a taller, older, and scruffier version of Rudy. One arm was wrapped around both of the other boys and the other hand was outstretched with a beer in it. He seemed to be shouting something. Rudy was in the middle with his arms crossed, looking like he didn’t want to be there. Though he smiled cheekily, as if he was secretly enjoying himself.

“That only leaves this guy unaccounted for,” Dustin said referring to the man on the right. “Monster Hunter turned supernatural serial killer,” he chuckled to himself, “who’d-a thought?”

I had to admit, it was bizarre, but becoming a supernatural will do weird things to you. “So he’s a revenant too?”

He stroked his thumb on the bottom of his lip, debating about it. “Seems like it. Not as put together as Rudy though.”

“No,”Jane said distantly, lost in thought. That look she gets when a stroke of brilliance hits suddenly shown on her face. I furrowed my brows curiously, watching as she analyzed the photo closer. “Guys what if, and this is a very big *if*, we were wrong? *I* was wrong?”

“How do you mean?” Dustin asked.

“As you said, who would think that a monster hunter would become a supernatural killer?” Jane vaguely elaborated. “What if these murders were staged to look like they’d been committed by a revenant, but were actually committed by someone and something else entirely?”

The gears were turning in his head, but Dustin still wasn’t getting it. “Like what?”

“Well, something happened or went wrong on their last hunt, leading to the death of the one guy and Rudy becoming a revenant.”

That’s when the snow ball started to roll for me.

“And where do revenant’s come from? What else drinks blood and has teeth sharp enough to rip out throats?” She said slowly, like Dustin and I were school children,

“Vampires,” I said, getting an epiphany.

Jane shot me a pleased smile. Slowly, Dustin’s eyes lit up as well, coming to the same conclusion.

“You said your witness is missing, right?” She asked urgently, clapping her hands together.

“Yeah,” Dustin said, fishing her phone out of his other pocket, “we found this at the crime scene, why?”

Jane reached her hand out to take it. Dustin gently placed it on the open palm of her hand. “Let’s find out where this Sage Walker lives.”

Finding the residence registered to the Sage Walker who owned the phone was simple. We just had to use the phone number linked with the provider to look up the account, and boom we had our home address.

What wasn’t so simple was the scene we found once we got there. After ringing the doorbell multiple times and discovering the front door to be unlocked, we announced our presence and went in.

Lying in the foyer was the rotted, mangled up body of an old woman. She’d been drained dry of her blood as she died, evident by the bite marks lining down her arms and legs. Leaving her corpse to partially mummify without the liquid. The body had been there a long time judging by the state of decomposition and how deflated it was.

Jane threw herself out the door and started to dry heave in the bushes from the smell. Dustin and I who were more used to it by now, powered through and searched the house. We let the stench of death radiate out through the open front door.

In the living room, resting in one of those decorative key holder bowls, was the woman’s wallet. I picked it up and opened it. The drivers license photo resembled what was left of the poor woman’s face. The ID belonged to Sage Walker.

I slammed the wallet shut and kicked the coffee table it had been on. “God dammit!”

“Woah, what’s going on over here?” Dustin asked, coming over to investigate.

With a heavy, defeated sigh, I handed the blue and white Vera Bradley wallet over to him. A non-committal, “hmm,” left his mouth.

“I can’t believe I’m so stupid!” I exclaimed, rubbing my temples. “Stupid enough that I couldn’t even realize I’ve been talking to a maniac this whole time! I messed up… big time.”

“Hey,” Dustin said softly, putting his hand on my shoulder. Instead of shrugging it off like I normally did, I let it rest there for a moment, feeling comforted by it. “It’s ok.”

I sniffled, holding back tears, sweeping a loose strand of hair behind my ear and catching sight of the bandage on my wrist. *God what going on with me? I need to get my shit together!*

Suddenly, somewhere, a phone started ringing. Dustin removed his hand off my shoulder to pat himself down and see if it was his. I hate to admit it felt cold and uncomfortable without it there.

Quickly pushing that thought away, I too started to search and see if the ringing cellphone belonged to me.

“Uh, guys?” Jane said as she re-entered the real Sage Walker’s house. The ringing persisted, only growing louder as she got closer. When Jane entered the living room, she stuck the cracked iPhone out like it contained the plague. “I think one of you should answer this.”

I immediately grabbed the phone, already knowing who was calling despite the caller ID saying unknown number.

After a hesitant tap, the phone finally stopped ringing. Another tap and the call went on speaker, broadcasting everything to the room.

“So, I see you finally figured out how to do your job. Good for you,” the voice on the other side of the phone was deeper than the first time we’d talked. Not as high pitched or uppity, but confident and velvety smooth. It was almost alluring.

“You’re an imposter,” I seethed. “You lied to me. Made it sound like you were kidnapped over the phone, when in reality you were just buying yourself more time.”

Fake Sage giggled. “Don’t hate the player, hate the game.”

“What exactly *is* your game?” Dustin asked, interjecting himself. “Why are you going around slaughtering people posing as a revenant?”

“Because I had to,” she said coldly.

“You had to?”I scoffed, “Because of you, six people are dead!”

“Yeah? Well, because of him my whole nest is dead!” She retorted, angrily. “We weren’t doing anything wrong! We were bloodsober for as long as we could. Then, we drank from livestock, never human! They came and hunted us down one by one. They were weak, but I was strong! Strong enough to fight back.”

Morbid curiosity took over as I asked, “Why? Why turn him?”

A, rueful, evil chuckle erupted from fake Sage as she answered. “I simply want to see him suffer. I was delighted by how he squirmed as I killed his friend, then poured my blood down both of their throat’s to turn them. The third hunter stabbed the friend in the chest, but I took care of him quickly. Then he came back crying those black bloody revenant tears and everything fell into place. I’d frame him for the murders and he’d die just like my nest. Hunted. Tortured. Then ultimately, brutally killed. Since you’ve already got him in custody, I’ll leave the rest to you.”

Tense, electric, silence filled the air after the vampire on the other side of the phone spilled her guts.

Not being able to say anything else, I went,“Where are you?”

A heavy breath came from the phone. “You don’t need to know. But, don’t worry, I won’t be sticking around long enough for you to find out.” In signature fake Sage fashion, she abruptly hung up.

Contrary to her belief though, not before we could trace where the call had come from.

Dumb vamp.

While she was on the line, Jane had been able to use her magic and bypass all the metadata to figure out where the call had originated from. Do we have the best profiler or what?

After she relayed the location, Dustin and I booked it for the car. Sage had already told us of her plans to disappear. Time was of the essence.

Dustin and I raced to beat the sunset. She’d be able to move faster and farther under the cover of darkness. Our escapade to the old woman’s house took us to the complete opposite side of town where the abandoned warehouse she’d called from was.

The sun had just barely slipped below the horizon when we reached the warehouse. The building was decrepit and old, surrounded on all sides except one by forest.

Claire de Lune played again as Dustin’s phone rang. It was Jane calling. He hurriedly clicked a button on his phone and the ringing ceased, attempting to stop ourselves from alerting the target of our presence. It rang again, but he turned his phone completely off.

She tried my cell next. If we weren’t right outside the den of a vampiric serial killer about to fade away into the unknown, I might’ve answered. Instead, I turned my phone off as well.

Like in our drills, Dustin and I were armed and equipped with wooden stake loaded crossbows in under a minute. After giving each other an understanding nod, we motioned to move in.

We were stopped in our tracks as a crunch came from the tree line. An image of The White Wolf flashed in my mind and I jumped, training the crossbow in the area the sound came from. Dustin covered my six while still paying attention to the thing in the brush.

*Crunch. crunch, crunch.* Then…

“Rudy?” I asked, perplexed enough to stop aiming my crossbow. How the hell did he escape?

He brushed mine and Dustin’s existence off, instead looking straight ahead at the warehouse. Rudy rolled up his grey jumpsuit sleeves, his fangs distended and eyes glowing a chillingly blood red that seemed even scarier in the light of dusk. “She’s mine,” he stated evenly before running off and barging in with inhuman speed.

Oh shit…

Someone is *definitely* losing their job.
