I sat in my office lost in thought. There was an inmate in my old life whose case didn't check out. He was a bit of a local terror. Named Henry, but known by all as Ol’ Hank. He was the guy you went to when you wanted a cheap car fast, with no credit check. He would take cash, of course, but he also accepted trades–drugs, alcohol, electronics…women. 

Hank wasn't a good guy. I wouldn't call him a villain, more of a high-key sleazeball. He trolled Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for vulnerable young women, for example. Eventually he found one. Twyla. Twyla was no stranger to working the system. She had two kids, neither of whom were special needs, both of whom collected disability for their non-existent special needs. Twyla herself was a nurse who was terminated for drinking on the job

It was a match made in hell. One day, New Year's Day in fact, Hank was seen lurching out of the house incoherent and bleeding. A witness called it in. Hank was taken away in an ambulance, and Twyla and both kids were taken to the morgue. All stabbed to death. Hank was arrested immediately, still the kind of drunk that would put the rest of us in a coma. That was his defense, btw..That being drunk and high on codeine left him far too sedated to stab two large young men and his girlfriend, then stab himself in the gut, which is one of the worst ways to die. I don't know. The evidence against him was overwhelming–but not enough to prevent him from  being mired in appeals for 26 years.

That case always bothered me. Hank was an asshole, and maybe a small, bad part of me believed he deserved to die. But, there was a lot of weird shit. His uncle was seen washing blood out of his truck. Caught on security cameras dumping his clothes and incinerating them. There was one piece of evidence left–a bloody jacket belonging to the uncle. Soaked in Twyla’s blood. 

It was lost in police custody. The biggest piece of evidence in a murder case and someone just what, forgot it somewhere? Lost an XXL blood soaked coat with a huge tag that said “evidence”? 

Fishy, if you asked me. Hank’s case was presided over by a former sheriff, now a judge, who was responsible for arresting Hank in a series of petty misdemeanors. They hated each other. Seemed like a conflict of interest but no one ever asks the executioner. Hank was driven to the Death House (the unit where we perform executions) three times, and was stayed three times. It went to the supreme Court back then. Four in favor of resentencing to Life Without Parole, 5 who voted to kill him. 

In his notes, a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, I wont say who, wrote “Sometimes when something doesn't pass the smell test, you just gotta throw the whole thing out.”

Hank was never executed. He died at 68 of a heart attack. No conspiracy, no nefarious plot. He died because he was in bad shape, he had cancer, and the effects of alcoholism finally took their toll. I was glad. I don't know what I believe about Ol’ Hank, but I knew he'd rather go out on some version of his own terms, not strapped to the table and euthanized like a dog.

Had he made it to the death chamber, I would have pushed the plunger. What is my life? Am I a just man? I put my head in my hands.

I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder. “Yes, Shepherd Reaper. You are a good man.” I looked up and knew I was staring at Lady Justice. In a way she scared me more than Death. Death can kill me, but Lady Justice can judge me.This lady knew all my deeds and misdeeds. Let's face it, I totally killed a guy. Her duty was not exacting petty revenge like Karma. This woman was the one with the scales. How many of us can say, really say with confidence, that the bad wouldn't tip the scales? Especially if you used the legal system to murder your daughter's rapist? The fear was there, sure, but so was grief and rage. I don't understand why that demon took my daughter. If he was going to rape and kill her, why the violence? Why did he choke her while singing Christmas carols? She loved Christmas, and they were perverted for her, tainted, in her last moments on earth. She could have lived and recovered. Where was Justice then? If any of you are parents and you had the chance to do what I did...would you?

I digress. Lady Justice certainly did not "have a titty out" as she does in sculptures. Karma bends the truth.Justice was fully covered in what looked like SWAT gear. Bullet proof vest, expertly shined shoes, and sure enough, aviator glasses. Apparently the gear was all sewn by Arachne. She looked to be in her late 30s, possibly early 40s. Quite attractive, though no one compares to my wife. I missed my wife. 

“I cannot intervene in the process of a crime. Otherwise the boy who harmed your daughter would be in a meat grinder right now. I can oversee due process. Restore balance, in the end..the issue is sometimes the end takes a long time. Years. Sometimes lifetimes. You should not have interfered. You made a mockery of the justice system. Of my duties. As it turns out, however, this one is above my pay grade.

Then a cold breath in my ear, not from Justice but some invisible presence, whispered, “He deserved to die. Fear not. Colton will never feel warmth again. There is no sun where he is. No people. His death is one of sparsity, cold, and isolation.”

I had just heard the voice of death, and I was relieved. Ain't that some shit?

“Ah, I hear she spoke to you. My sister tells me she appeared the other night. You are getting closer to meeting our Lady of Death. We do not tease to be cruel. Unlike your jealous God who would hoard all for himself, you are to have as much knowledge as possible.Your brain is your most powerful armor; the knowledge within your greatest protector. Without knowledge, I fear you would go insane. I've seen it happen.”

I shuddered.

“You fear the right things. Concepts outside of your own needs.”

“You have one more to meet. Our Lady Liberty. She is in the infirmary, guarded by Keeper of the Rainbow Bridge. Keep this in mind when humanity seems like a scourge upon the earth. You made a bridge of rainbows with its very own boy to lead your pets to great green fields, stars, adventures, the best smells and greatest tastes, endless sunbeams and beds to lay in, trees made of peanut brittle that bloom toys. You all agreed this was the only suitable Beyond. And so it became real.

Without knowing you assigned them a guardian. He is the  boy on the bridge. His name is Styx Featherton. We all call him Sticks.”

Justice paused, seemingly composing herself. “Take my hand. It's time for a change of scenery.”

Not a second later I heard the unmistakable noises of a hospital room. On the bed lay a regal woman. Could have been 60 or 30. She was ageless. And she was sick. A small black cat purred by her head.

A little boy of 7 or 8, who I assumed was Styx, announced that she was dying. 

“I WILL NOT TAKE HER”.

Three guesses who that disembodied voice was.

Justice spoke quietly, holding Liberty's hand. “No, sister. We cannot have liberty and justice for all without you. Remember? I'm the enforcer. You're the inspiration. And Shepherd here is going to help. Would you like to tell him, or shall I?”

Liberty looked at me directly in the eyes. “They took my crown. They took my torch. Without them, I will succumb to death.”

“NO YOU WON’T.”

“I will,” Liberty said. It's your sworn duty to God.” 

“TELL THE OLD BOOMER I SEND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.”

Then all hell broke loose.
