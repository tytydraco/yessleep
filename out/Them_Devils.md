On the night when it all happened a young man called Smallmouth found himself in quite a pickle.  He shivered and paced clumsily all over the second story porch of a cabin that used to be very nice, which overlooked a snowy down-sloping field that used to be kept up properly and carefully.  He was already six packs deep into a carton of cigarettes he had bought only two days ago from a Casey’s General Store on his way up.  He could recall the look on the young woman’s face at the register when he asked for a carton of Parliament Menthols, her eyes showing one blink of humorous surprise and another couple blinks of obvious concern, which faded to professional indifference as she rang in the sweet, icy killers.  Smallmouth stopped his nervous dallying when he caught himself in the kitchen window; a large, shadowy figure sulking between the inside lights and the cold, almost glowing world downhill.  His eyes still on his murky reflection, he patted his coat pockets for his seventh pack, pulling it out and smacking it against his left palm before cracking open and lighting it at his mouth.  In a slow, warm flash, he could briefly see his own face in the window. 

“Oh man, it’s bad” , he thought to himself. 

He hadn’t shaved in weeks and his beard grew coarse and thick.  A face that his mother had once called handsome had become a clean plate covered in steel wool.  Well, maybe not so clean.  Under and around his eyes were the obvious bruising of  sleeplessness and his skin had lost its lively color and clarity of yesteryear. 

“Ughhh” he groaned, turning away from the window to look over the porch and into the freezing, beckoning night. 

The pickle that Jeremy “Smallmouth” Bassett found himself in involved his uncle, and his uncle’s evening logistics, to be precise.  Smallmouth had been kicked out of his parents home on December 27th due to a slight misunderstanding at 2am when he believed the living room Christmas tree to be the downstairs bathroom.  He had passed out on the couch after drinking a fire pit full of crushed Hamm’s cans and his brain tried desperately to get him up and to the nearby toilet.  His little sister Stacy was tucked in fast asleep on a loveseat by the tree when she was brutally torn from her sugarplum dreams to hear the terrible hiss of Smallmouth’s folly.  She screamed, the parents woke up, and, well, there you go.  After well over three strikes, Smallmouth’s temporary residence had come to an end, and he was thrown to his mother’s brother’s cabin to dry up and straighten out before he could ever even be considered to return.  

“You two deserve to live together.  He can’t say no either because he owes me a lot more than this!” Smallmouth’s mother had screeched over him as he sat at the kitchen table the following morning with a cold bag of peas against his throbbing right temple. 
“You go there and you GET RIGHT!!  I don’t care how long it takes just clean up your act and MAKE something of yourself!  And for goodness sake tell Chuck to do the same, while he still has time!”

Yes, Uncle Chuck had his own shelf full of good time problems, and that’s what put Smallmouth in a bind tonight as he pondered over the white yonder that led to a black nothing, a black nothing that in the daylight pretended to be a forest.  At night, it showed its true nature, an endless world of dark secrets and aching regret.  At least that’s how Smallmouth saw it in this moment.  

Chuck had gone down to the ranch he worked on for a New Years party with his work buddies.  They liked to gather at the big barn where all of the vehicles and equipment were kept, sitting around a card table passing out stories about women and other trophy game that were either outright lied about or illegally poached.  Oh, and they also liked to pass the bottle around.  Therein lied the conundrum for Smallmouth.  

Uncle Chuck was many things, but one thing he wasn’t was a drunk driver.  Chuck’s wife Rebecca had been struck and killed by a drunk driver almost ten years ago when she was out jogging the back roads early one morning.  Everyone assumed that’s what led him to his openly hard drinking and sneakily pill popping ways in the first place.  For Chuck, most nights were kept at home, parked in front of a TV watching old westerns and cleaning out a full bottle of Wild Turkey 101 before snoring in his recliner.  On the few nights he would go out, he would always call a ride if things got out of hand.  As you can imagine,  he tends to need a ride home.  

“I should be home bout 11:30.  Service ain’t so good up there near the barn so if it gets bout 11:15-11:20 and I ain’t home, go head and do me a favor and come grab me son.” Chuck had told Smallmouth before he left, closing the warped screen door behind him.  

Smallmouth had spent the evening trying his best to stay entertained without the help of any chemical enhancement.  His family’s anger and resentment really struck him and this time he was determined to truly get right and get his life back on the rails.  He was 29 years old.  He had gone through college clean as a whistle, bright and driven, receiving his MBA with plans to work his way up in a promising career in business.  That worked for a couple years.  Then he found a calling in ministry, deciding to quit the corporate world to fill an opening of a tiny country church in the area.  They needed a deacon who could take care of things around the building and assist in the worship service.  He wasn’t much for public speaking, haven been given the nickname Smallmouth at a young age due to his soft spoken nature, but he could pass plates and give a hushed prayer every now and then.  He liked to mow and paint and help old ladies up the stairs.  The quiet country life was really nice for him, for a while.  Strange, radical ideas eventually spread through the church though, and half of its members left overnight to form their own congregation.  Its funding cut in half, the church had to close its doors and the other members absorbed into other churches.  Smallmouth rarely ever saw the people that had departed from the church, but rumors creeped that they met at an old abandoned building deep in the woods, performing all sorts of different acts and rituals that would purify themselves and destroy all evils.  Nevertheless, Smallmouth was out of work and picked up shifts bartending at a small town dive.  His soft fortitude was no match for the booze and drugs and women that would pass through there and soon he was out the door.  That landed him mooching off of his parents, draining their sanity and eventually draining himself on their Christmas tree.  The last strike.  

So there he was all night, waiting up for uncle Chuck.  He was two days clean of everything except caffeine and nicotine, a major improvement.  He felt a major boost of hope and confidence the first morning after a sober nights sleep.  He found the mornings to be the best parts of the day.  At least he had coffee and cigarettes to get him out of bed.  That would wear off quickly and the rest of the day was filled with trying to find distractions until the sun set about 5pm.  Then he would watch a movie or two with Chuck.  Last night he had been able to call it early and go to sleep at 7pm shortly after Chuck started sawing logs in front of True Grit (the original John Wayne version of course).   Tonight he saw 7pm struggle and churn into 8…….8:13……..8:48……9:05……9:29………..9:31………9:52……..9:58……….10:11…….10:12 (oh cmon)……10:27…….10:56…….and finally 11:08.  It was like the clock was a 35 year old four cylinder engine oiled with crunchy peanut butter.   Now, crunch time sat in the cold air as Smallmouth finished his cigarette  and stewed over his decision.  He really didn’t feel like going down to the barn and getting Chuck, even though it was only a couple miles.  In the infancy of his sobriety he found the smallest of choices and activities to seem dire and at the very least upsettingly out of his way.  Surely Chuck can get himself home on his own, right?

“No.  Who knows if someone’s Aunt Rebecca or grandmother or son is out there on the road tonight” he thought.  

As much as he had tried to screw up his life, Smallmouth usually knew what the right decision would be, even if he so often refused to listen.  It was there ever so clearly  on this New Year’s Eve, wailing in the back row of his mind like a misbehaved child during a church sermon.   Smallmouth left the porch and went inside to grab his keys.  


He walked out to his truck, got in, cranked it, let it sit down to one rpm, and started down the gravel driveway, which led to the gravel county road that Chuck and his few and far between neighbors lived on.  He got to the mailbox and suddenly shot his attention up the road, where headlights revealed themselves out of the deep dark.  It was rare to see any cars this far down Chuck’s road.  In fact, there were no other houses to the right of Chuck’s cabin, spare for a couple of empty ones that were condemned but were attached to a lot of forest property.  

Smallmouth squinted his eyes as a large black Dodge Ram 3500 came barreling by with a livestock trailer.  Even inside his own truck he could hear a terrible noise coming from that trailer.  He recognized it instantly as a pig squeal.  

“The hell?” He whispered as the truck and trailer tore down the road, going around a nearby corner and out of sight.  He couldn’t guess what on earth that could be about at this hour, and especially since nobody lived down there anyway.  He shrugged it off though, and turned left out of the driveway, headed for drunk Uncle Chuck down at the ranch.  


Ten minutes and a couple of snowy country miles later Smallmouth found himself through the metal gate of the ranch and up to the main barn, where a couple of smiling ranch hands had Chuck held up between them just outside one of two closed garage doors.  A lamppost nearby cast a glow of debauchery on all of their faces, especially Chuck’s.  Smallmouth got out and walked up to them smiling and shaking his head.  

“Well well well…” he said with a slight laugh. 

“Your Uncle put on one hell of a clinic tonight ‘Mouth” one of the hands said. 

“I…..I….I don’t know what they’re tawlkin bout son” Chuck slang out before a high pitched giggle.  

“I got another couple rounds in me I thinks!”

Smallmouth laughed.  

“Yeah I ain’t so sure about that uncle!  Let’s get on home now and let these fellas get on too.”

“Y’alright alright” Chuck said as Smallmouth took him from his buddies arms into one of his own and led him to the passenger seat of his truck.  

“Happy New Years boys!!! Let’s do it all again okay?”  He hollered to his waving buddies as they drove back away from the barn and through the metal gate toward home.  

“You have a good time Uncle?”

“Oh…ohhh…I reckon I showed those boys how to do it” Another childish giggle. 

A light snow shower seasoned the cold air as the truck rolled down the gravel country road.  In the yellow headlights it made a pleasant white noise for the eyes.  Chuck put his hands up staggered and vertically, fingers together and outstretched, pointing out in front of the truck down the road like he was aiming up for a rifle shot.  He closed one eye.  

“Straight as an arrow ole son.  You’re good at this.”

“I ain’t drunk pops” Smallmouth chuckled.  

“Sure ya are.  Everybody’s drunk son.  Even people that ain’t drink.  Ticket is to get drunk on good stuff” Chuck’s face calmed from a goofy grin as he kept his eyes out front into the slow swirling tube of visible night. 

“You sound like you’re drunk on some pretty damn good stuff” Smallmouth retorted as they shared a look and a good laugh. 

“Suppose’n you ain’t wrong.  Gotta work on that just like you are.  Proud o’ you for a couple days clean man.  We’ll get right.  We’ll get right.  All I meant was that man is born to get drunk on somethin’ or other.  What I mean is God.  Man is born to get drunk on his God.”  Chuck said as Smallmouth shot him a raised eyebrow look of confusion.  

“Once God gets ya drunk then you’re home free ol’ son.  That distillery is never ending eternal forever.  That land flows with whiskey and honey.”  They both shared another laugh. 

“Okay okay I think I somewhat understand now Uncle.”

They rode in a few seconds of comfortable silence before Chuck put his hands up in an aim position down the road again.  

“You know…man….man….man has a GOVERNOR…..you know that right?”

“A what?  A governor?”

“That’s right a GOVERNOR…that’s right…a little bitty device in his brain that keeps him on the road…keeps him from turning right off into the dark.  You ever hear that little voice that tells you you can turn off into the ditch…into oncomin’ traffic?  Tells you you can shoot your buddy instead of the deer?  That you can jump off the top of the building and onto the pavement when you’re up there enjoying the view?”

“I…uh…I don’t know…I mean maybe?  Pretty sure those are intrusive thoughts and they’re normal.”

“Well whatever they are that’s what the governor is for.  Keeps ya straight.  Keeps ya from harmin nothin.”

“Alright man, alright.”

They pulled back into Chuck’s driveway and parked.  Smallmouth helped his uncle out of the truck and up into the cabin, snow starting to color the roof and pile against the side of the house near the door.  Arms locked Smallmouth propped open the screen door, opened the inner door, and led Chuck through the kitchen and to his bedroom.  Chuck layed down on his camo comforter with a deep, long exhale. 

“Ahhhh yes……yes” he whispered with a smile. 

“I love ya son…I’m glad you’re heeeeere.  Let’s get better….your mom needs it…..stay in the Lord’s light son…don’t let them devils get ya….let’s get better….lets….” He was off into the distant deep ether almost immediately, and his mouth hung open.  

“Goodnight uncle…love ya too.”  Smallmouth patted the bed twice before walking over and closing the bedroom door behind him.  

He went and sat at the kitchen table.  He regretted his behavior earlier in the night.  How it pained him to have to stay up a little later to go help out his uncle.  

“Cmon…” he whispered. 

He agreed with Chuck.  He was here to get better.  To do better.  Maybe Chuck was right.  If he couldn’t get drunk off booze, it was time to pick something else to drink.  Better things.  Maybe even God?  Smallmouth hadn’t paid much mind to God since his church job fell through.  God surely hadn’t been there for him these last few years when he was at his lowest.  Or was He there the whole time?  Had Smallmouth just ignored Him?  These things floated heavily in his mind and soon he realized he had been staring at the front door for several minutes.  Had he even blinked? Then something else came to mind. 

“Wait hold up”

That truck and trailer from earlier.  What WAS that?  He meant to bring it up to the ranch hands.  They would’ve seen it come barreling down the road right by their front gate.  Oh he wished he had brought that up to them.  Oh well.  It’s probably nothing. Smallmouth looked at the clock.  12:12.

“Happy New Year old boy.”  He said to himself.  

He sat for a moment in the warm kitchen light, his eyes not leaving the front door.  Well, he’s up this late already, why not go run down and check on the abandoned properties?  

No…no…it can wait.  It’s probably nothing.  Right?

Wrong.  There’s that wailing kid in the back pew of his mind again.  Come on kid can’t you just be quiet and listen to the sermon?  No, no it can’t.  It must be heard.  Always.  He knew he had to go check it out.  

“Ughhhh FINE!”  Smallmouth got up and grabbed his truck keys, patted to make sure his cigarettes were still there, and was out the door again.  


As he pulled up to the edge of the drive, he stalled for a moment and peaked out as far to the right as he could down the dark road.  Nothing.  It wasn’t very far to the end of that road, where two out of service mailboxes should’ve stood in a small cul-de-sac if it weren’t for teenagers beating them to splinters.  Can’t really blame them either.  Smallmouth considered his plan.  Whether or not that truck belonged to the landowner down there, he shouldn’t feel like he needs to sneak around.  He is merely a concerned neighbor after all.  He began down the road and around that same corner the stranger disappeared earlier.  

After a couple of slow, curious minutes Smallmouth could see the evidence of a great big fire in the near distance, beyond where the road ended.  Through the bare trees and against the snow it cast orange and red that could surely be seen a mile in every direction, that is, if there were anyone there to see it.  

Slightly intimidated, Smallmouth decided to turn off his headlights and let the fire guide him as he slowed up to 5mph and gently crackled his last few yards of gravel up to the remnants of the nearest mailbox post.  It seemed the fire was on the land of the farther property, whose mailbox posthole was about 30 feet from where he came to a stop and parked his truck.  Smallmouth turned it off and quietly got out into the cold.  He crouched down as he walked over to the farther driveway, getting down on one knee to give it a stealthy closer look.  

The abandoned property boasted a busted up trailer that sat pitifully about 500 feet from the mailbox memorial.  Beyond that was a good ten acres of field that ended at the forest edge, which marked the beginning of thousands of acres of wildlife refuge.  As Smallmouth peered on, it was obvious that the fire was way out in that field, blocked by the old trailer, which wore the hot light and columns of smoke on it like a devilish crown.  Given the cover, Smallmouth crept over to the trailer and started easing around the right side.  

Rounding the corner he noticed a propane tank that would be perfect for hiding behind and getting the best look he could at the mysterious activity.  He got down on his belly and crawled his way over to the tank, before sitting up and peeking slowly over the top and out into the field.  

Way down there, a couple acres away from the tree line, was a huge fire, made up of about fifty wooden pallets.  It raged and lit up the whole field like it was just the beginning of sunset.  Somewhat near the fire was the black Dodge Ram 3500 and trailer.  Smallmouth could see a group of people dressed in all red, as if covered in bloody bedsheets from head to toe, circled around a crude cage, seemingly fastened together by pieces of metal fencing.  They stood still as the pines, and twice as silent.  Smallmouth, in a rare moment of curious courage, decided he had to get closer.  He got back on his stomach and began to crawl through the cold, knee high grass.  

Using the fire light as his North Star he crawled and crawled, feeling his hands, clothes, and beard get wet with snow.  He didn’t care.  Something was up that wasn’t normal, wasn’t right.  He could feel it in his cold gut.  When he thought he was close enough without giving himself away he planted his palms and ever so slowly raised his torso up into a weak push up to try and see out.  He was glad he didn’t go any further.  He may have been too close already.  

He was close enough to read the name of the truck and count the holes in the livestock trailer.  There were seven strangers in red sheets all around the makeshift cage, all holding long spears.  One of the figures had a crown of black thorns on his head.  They all had two eyeholes and one hole for the mouth.  They didn’t move a muscle for the longest time, before the Crowned One forcibly touched the end of his spear to the ground.  

“Now is the time, Brother and Farmer Abraham…there is no more for us in waiting.”

Smallmouth had just noticed the passenger window to the black Dodge was down, and he could hear the driver door open and soon saw a normal looking older man in a ball cap at the back of the trailer.  He was holding a leash of some sort.  He opened up the trailer and whistled into the dark of it.  After a couple of loud, heavy thuds a gigantic, and I mean GIGANTIC Yorkshire pig came slowly shrugging out of the trailer.  It was light pink in color but filthy, and gave wet sounding oinks as it came to the man’s hands expecting food.  The thing must’ve weighed 1500 pounds, and at least ten feet long.  It actually had to lower its head to reach the man’s hands, its ears coming up to the man’s chest.  Smallmouth couldn’t believe his eyes.  The man reached in his pocket and revealed a handful of some type of feed, which he tossed on the ground at the pig.  It started right in as the man fixed a collar on the pigs girthy neck, then attaching a leash.  The pig gave a slight squeal.  

“Good girl, good girl…cmon now” the man called Farmer Abraham sweetly coaxed the animal.  He gave his end of the leash a tug and the monstrous swine reluctantly left its food and followed the man over close to the Crowned One.  The fire raged and raged nearby, throwing crazy shadows all over the place.  

“What have you brought us, Brother and Farmer Abraham?”

“Yeah, uh, this is Old Azazel, she’s been in my family for years, man.”

The Crowned One dropped his spear and knelt down to the jowls of the hog, the dark holes of his eyes meeting those of the animal.  The other red cloaked figures remained statuesque around the cage.  

“Ah, yes, Old Azazel, hello.  You are to be of great importance in the history of the Earth tonight, old friend.”

The Crowned One got back up to address Brother and Father Abraham, who seemed obviously put off, yet submissive.  

“And is this Old Azazel a natural specimen?  Is it fed only of the earth and the filths therein?”

“Yessir, I’d reckon so.”

“This is necessary for a proper sacrifice, Brother and Farmer Abraham.  You may only bring your best, your cleanest, your most dear to the alter of the Almighty.”

“I understand.”

“May I take her now?”

The farmer gave his end of the leash to the black gloved left hand of the Crowned One.  The Crowned one stood with it for almost a full minute in total stillness and silence.  The only noise Smallmouth could hear was the sloppy smacks and oinks from Old Azazel.  The farmer anxiously waited, wringing his hands expecting the next move from the Crowned One.  

“Turn away,  Brother and Farmer Abraham.  Turn away from us and toward the fire now.”
The Crowned One finally spoke.

“Phew, alright.  We’re still good on our deal?  Do you still promise to make my little girl better?  Like you said?”  The farmer asked, with some hopeful desperation.  

“Turn now.”

“Well okay” the farmer turned his back to the Crowned One and toward the fire.  

“I can assure you with all of the knowledge in my mind and in my heart, you will never see your daughter sick again in this lifetime, Brother and Father Abraham.  You may find peace and solace in this truth.”

The farmer nodded in relief as he looked upon the fire.  Smallmouth, taking it all in with great confusion, could see a smile on the farmers fire lit face, and turned back to the Crowned One just in time to see him reach under his red garment and pull out a pistol and shoot a round into the back of the farmers head, blowing his cap off, which frisbeed down near his shaking, crumpled body.  Old Azazel threw a fit immediately, screaming and trying her best to flee.  The Crowned One held the immense beast with one hand, and with seemingly little effort.  The other red clothed figures finally made noise, laughing deep and heartily around the cage.  The Crowned One, keeping Old Azazel close, walked over to the doubled over farmer, putting two more bullets into his head, essentially hollowing it out into a carnal mess.  The farmers shaking mercifully stopped.  

Smallmouth had to slam his forearm up to his mouth to muffle the scream that would’ve come out and blown his cover.  His eyes were flown wide open and his arms were shivering.  

The Crowned One put the pistol back under his red cloak and led the great pig, still squealing as high pitched and piercing as the human ear can withstand, over to the mouth of the cage, which was opened by the nearest red clothed stranger.  Old Azazel flew in to the cage, having been unleashed by The Crowned One.  It struggled around the cage, which was no bigger than 15x15 feet, giving it no room to get comfortable.  It circled the inner perimeter, showing impressive speed for such a large animal.  It squealed and squealed.  The sound stung Smallmouths ears, and he covered them with his hands.  He was still out of sight in the tall grass.  The Red People around the cage laughed and laughed at the hogs entrapment.  The Crowned One raised a hand to signal silence.  The Red People were still and quiet again.  

“Now, my brothers, the sacrificial gift is in our possession.  Tonight…is a HOLY NIGHT.”  The Crowned One raised his voice as if getting to the climax of a fire and brimstone sermon. 

“TONIGHT…WE WILL DESTROY WHAT WAS ONCE CAST OUT BUT NEVER VANQUISHED!!  WE WILL RID THE EARTH OF A GREAT ARMY!!  AN ARMY OF HELL THAT HAS FAR TOO LONG ROAMED AND SICKENED OUR LANDS AND KILLED OUR LOVES!!  TONIGHT…WE WILL DESTROY THE DESTROYERS…THE LEGION OF SATANS SOLDIERS BORN JUST AFTER THE GARDEN OF EDEN FELL…”

The Crowned One fell to his knees, his arms up and stretched toward the frozen sky.  A mighty wind began blowing at Smallmouths back. He had to lower his head as it roared over him.  After a moment it calmed and he was able to lift up again to see.  Winds from all corners of the field met at the cage, swirling over it in a great snowy funnel that led up to the clouds.  Old Azazel screamed and screamed from the cage.  

“I SEE YOU VILLIANS!!  I HEAR YOU HOSTS OF HELL!!  I KNOW YOU LIVE IN THESE TREES!!  I KNOW YOU COWER WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE!!  SHOW YOURSELF!!  TAKE THE BODY OF THIS ANIMAL THAT I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU!!  TAKE IT NOW!!  TAKE IT NOW AND FACE ME!!  TAKE IT NOW!!  TAKE IT NOW!!  TAKE I-“

The Crowned One’s vocal cord shredding performance was cut short by a single burst of black lightning that shot down from the middle of the snowy funnel cloud that surrounded the cage.  The Crowned One and all the Red People were thrown several feet back from the blast.  Thunder immediately exploded across the field. Smallmouth buried his face as the force and sound raced over him.  Ears ringing, he kept his face down for a few seconds.  He squinted back up to the strike zone. 

The strange black lightning had blown the cage completely apart.  Two of The Red People had been hit with the metal fencing.  One laid motionless.  The other gargled in pain as he put a hand to the pole that was sticking out of his sternum, having penetrated all the way through.  His legs buckled and he fell forward, the end of the pole hitting the ground first and propping him up for a moment, before his body slowly slid down to the ground around the metal.  He went silent.  The other four Red People, yelling in surprise, gathered themselves, looking to the charred hole in the ground where Old Azazel should be, right in the center where the cage used to stand.  The Crowned One got to his feet and picked up his spear.  

“My brothers, gather your arms…” the Crowned One whispered, breathing heavily under his red cloak.  

“The work is not over…”

The four remaining Red People grabbed their spears and slowly walked over to the burnt, smoking hole, holding an attack pose over it until further instructions were given.  

“Are you with us, you age old tormentors?”  This was the first time Smallmouth could hear fear in the tired voice of the Crowned One.

“Are you with us now?  Are you ready to die, you infernal bastards?  Are you ready to-“

The Crowned One was interrupted by a booming noise from the hole that tore Smallmouths wits to shreds.  It was similar to the cry of Old Azazel, but octaves deeper and ten times louder and angrier.  It was as if a freight train was blaring its horn and slamming its brakes at the same time.  

“NOW MY BROTHERS!!  STRIKE THE BEAST OF HELL WITH YOUR SPEARS!  NOW!!!”

The Red People all threw their weapons down into the smoking hole.  The hellish noise from within stopped in an instant.  The Red People crowded closer to the edge of the hole, waiting for the smoke to clear.  The Crowned One walked over to them, putting his black gloved hand on the shoulder of the nearest man.  

“Oh, Brothers.  Oh my dear, dear Brothers.  Your acts tonight have rid the earth of a Great and Powerful Evil…”

Before he could continue, a fully enraged and re-inspired bellow thrust itself up and out of the hole like a rusty serrated blade.  Much, much louder and angrier than before.  The Red People were taken aback in terror.  Suddenly, from within the hole, a large head emerged and gaped a huge, disgusting, tusked maw up at the crowd.  The head was burned black and its eyes were half boiled white and without pupils.  It shrieked out that most terrible noise as if it didn’t need oxygen.  

“There’s no way” Smallmouth heard himself say under his breath. 

All in one motion, the beast leaped out of the hole, and turned to face its attackers.  It was Old Azazel, except swollen with burnt mass.  It appeared to have grown a half a size at least.  Three spears stuck out of its sizzling, charcoal colored back.  It snapped its gigantic jaws at the Red People, who shuddered in horror.  The Crowned One spoke:

“DO NOT RELENT BROTHERS!!  ATTACK!!  ATTACK THE BRUTE!!”

He pulled his pistol back out of his cloak and fire the remaining three rounds on the new and horrible black burnt Old Azazel.  The beast’s cloudy boiled egg eyes shot open along with its unnaturally stretched jaws.  It took the three bullets as if they were tennis balls.  At the speed of a charging grizzly and with multiple times the power Old Azazel raged over to The Crowned One and dove onto him tusks first, putting both front hooves on his chest as he was knocked down.  The Crowned One cried out in a shockingly high pitched wail, like a man being electrocuted.  The Beast hooked its black tusks into his pectorals and bit right into the soft of his belly, and began to shake him around like an Orca trying to separate a seal from its pelt.  

“OH GOD!!!! AHHHHHH GOD OHHHHH!!!  HELP ME!!!!  NOOOO!!!!  OH GOD HELP ME!!!!  MAMA!!!! OHHHH!!!  MAMA!!!!!”

The beast ate and ate and shook and shook and tore and broke and destroyed while the Crowned One lost more and more of his body, all while crying out to the sky at the top of his punctured lungs.  The other Red People sprinted to the black Dodge Ram, opened its doors and piled inside.  Smallmouth heard it crank up and it began to speedily turn around and race away from the fire and back toward the road.  The beast unhooked from the Crowned One and let out another ghastly roar of victory before biting into his neck, ending his screaming forever.  The beast then left his half devoured body and began a tremendous and terrible charge after the truck, which was greatly slowed down by the trailer.  Smallmouth put his face down as the beast passed him by only about 10 feet on its way to the truck, which had just made it back to the road and was using every RPM possible to get away from the demon charged killing machine on its heels.  Smallmouth turned around to watch both parties disappear down the road, the echoes of that great and evil blasting noise stabbing his ears again.  He remained on his stomach in the tall, snowy grass for another two minutes as he normalized his breath and tried to make any sense of what he just witnessed.  

Eventually he slowly rose up and looked to make sure that terrible thing was indeed out of the area.  No signs of life or death from up at the road.   The danger was at least a couple miles away by now.  Smallmouth then turned back toward the fire and to the dominated body of the Crowned One.  He carefully walked up closer and closer.  To his amazement he heard wheezy noises coming from the emptied out torso of the man, a scattering of insides and flesh and blood strewn all around him.  Troubled, rattling breaths escaped from under the red clothed head, whose crown of thorns had flown off in the attack.  Most of the red cloak had been ripped to shreds, and all that remained covered were his shoulders and above.  The cloth slowly ebbed and flowed with breath. Smallmouth could not believe this man was still alive.  His entire digestive system was eviscerated and his ribs were exposed.  Smallmouth knelt down beside him and lifted his cloak over his head to let him at least breathe his last in the open air.  

Smallmouth let out a gasp.  This man had a face that Smallmouth knew very well.  He recognized him immediately from the old church he worked at.  The clean shaven face.  The short, silver hair.  The sharp nose.  This was a man that had joined his church two weeks before the schism.  He never spoke in church but it was rumored he would meet at the homes of different members and try to sway them to his strange ideas.  He was the one rumored to have led the radical faction somewhere in the middle of the woods.  To Smallmouth, it was all starting to make more sense.  

“I know you,” Smallmouth said softly, “I know who you are.  You tore a church in half didn’t you?  You’re the crazy guy that split up my ole church!  What the hell have you done?”

The man struggled to breathe and tried his best to spit up a couple of words.  His neck had deep lacerations that flowed with escaping life. 

“I…I…I…uhh…I only…I only…I only did what I believed…” he whispered before a wet, stifled breath.  

“What did you do?!!!”  Smallmouth grew angry, and his voice followed suit.  This man had ruined his job and now he had unleashed something horrifying on his neighborhood.  He had tampered with things that man has no business tampering with.  

“I…I…I have…have…I have failed, Smallmouth Bassett”  the man croaked.  Smallmouth couldn’t believe he had bothered to remember his name.  

“I have failed.  I have failed.  God help you all…”  with that the man’s face fell and he let out one last slow exhale before all was still.  

Smallmouth got back on his feet and looked away from the dead man and toward the fire, which towered and raged in the reflection of his eyes.  

“Oh no…oh no…oh no” he said in between terrified breaths.  

Then another though hit him like a wrecking ball.  

“Uncle Chuck…”
