I wanted to find a quick and easy summer job between semesters to make a little extra money before classes started up again. I settled on working at this local amusement park near my university.

The park is locally known by seemingly everybody, but I didn’t grow up near the area so I had no idea what to expect. I sent in my application and received a call back almost immediately. I went in for an in person interview and was hired before the interview was even completed. I filled out all the paperwork that I needed to fill out and they told me when I would start working.

My first day was supposed to be tomorrow, but I just received this email a few hours ago and now I’m seriously starting to have second thoughts about my new employer. 

This email is being sent out to all the workers that are currently employed at Amazing Amy’s Amusement Park. Several complaints have been made over the past couple of weeks pertaining to some of the attractions around the park and how potentially dangerous they could be to customers and employees alike. One particular family is even considering pressing charges against the park for an incident that took place several days ago involving the merry-go-round, despite the fact that it was because of us and our quick response time that we were able to reattach the young boy’s arms. But a separate email has already been sent out about that so I won’t go into further detail.
 
We here at Amazing Amy’s Amusement Park value the lives and well-being of our customers above anything else. So, as a precaution, and to ensure that every employee at Amazing Amy’s is following the correct procedure, management has decided to send out a mass email reminding everybody of the proper rules and regulations needed in order to keep this park safe and secure at all times. To avoid any confusion going forward I will try and make each of these instructions as detailed as possible to ensure that there is no room for error. Please do your very best to follow these rules exactly as written going forward. Your very lives might depend on it.
 
Number 1. I’d like to start out this list by reminding everyone of the proper way to contact management for any questions or concerns about the park. If you’d like to talk to management, whether it’s to report a complaint or request time off, you need to write a handwritten note using the old parchment paper located in the breakroom’s filing cabinet. After filling out the paper, you will need to take it to the East end of the park and place it into the old wooden box behind the abandoned ticket booth. You’ll know which box it is because there will be all sorts of strange symbols carved into the wood. DO NOT place your hand directly into the box and if the feeling of being watched over comes you at any point leave that area immediately.
 
Number 2. As we’ve said before, the health and well-being of our customers is our number one priority which is why management has hired its own private security company. This security company is available on park premises 24 hours a day, so no outside law enforcement should ever be contacted under any circumstances. This includes situations such as stolen property, vandalism, assault, grotesque bodily harm, etc. Any incidents that take place on park grounds should be reported to park security and park security only. Their main job is to keep the park open while making it as safe as possible for everyone here, so please do not get in their way. They are also known for having a very fast reaction time once their assistance is needed. So if you call them and they seem to immediately show up out of nowhere, just remember that this is completely normal.
 
Number 3. The Ferris wheel, located in the back of the park, tends to have a mind of its own sometimes. Occasionally, this attraction will begin to move and won’t stop even if the emergency brake is engaged. As you can imagine, this makes it impossible for anybody to get on or get off the ride. In the circumstance where this happens just let the ride drive itself until manual control is returned. As a ride technician, your job is to keep everyone calm and collected until you are able to operate the ride again. This may take anywhere from five minutes to five hours, but once you’ve regained control of the Ferris wheel you can start allowing guests to enter and exit the ride normally again. You may notice that several of the seats that you left empty now have people in them that weren’t there before. If this were to occur, please just ignore them.
 
Number 4. The Amazing Amy’s funhouse attraction, which is located in the south-western portion of the park, will, on occasion, become over run by a group of people wearing clown costumes. These clowns are not a part of the Amazing Amy’s work force. I repeat, these clowns ARE NOT a part of the Amazing Amy’s work force, and should not be approached under any circumstances. They will more than likely appear from the woods surrounding the funhouse, and will try persuading passing customers to enter the attraction while they are there. Any employees that notice this group of clowns are required to immediately shut down the attraction and leave the area until all of the clowns have disappeared back into the trees. This may take several minutes. If there are any patrons still inside the funhouse whenever the clowns appear, then the ride technician should increase the volume of the circus music playing from the funhouse’s speakers. We find that this does a good job of covering up the screams of any customers that are stuck inside.
 
Number 5. Every once in a while you may find a little girl crying all by herself near the ring toss game in the north-eastern part of the park. She’s about five years old. She’s usually wearing a bright yellow dress and is almost always carrying a red balloon with her. Whenever you see this girl, cautiously approach her and ask her if she is lost. She’ll probably respond by saying that she’s looking for her mom and will ask you for help. Take her by the hand and walk her down to the tunnel behind the bumper cars. Tell the little girl that her mother is inside the tunnel waiting for her. She’ll thank you for your help and then walk inside. Under no circumstances should you follow her into the tunnel. It doesn’t matter what she tells you or what you may hear coming from the tunnel. DO NOT ENTER. We suggest running away from that area as soon as you let go of her hand, to avoid being grabbed.
 
And that’s just about all you need to know. Management also felt that it was necessary to include a few short reminders pertaining to some of the other general rules that need to be followed at all times here at Amazing Amy’s. Please commit these to memory, as they are just as important as the main requirements for this park.
 
Reminder 1: There is no employee that works here with the name “Quinn.” If you happen to see someone walking around the park wearing an employee uniform with the name Quinn written on it please inform park security.
 
Reminder 2: The gorilla animatronic located inside the Noah’s Ark attraction likes to move around a lot whenever the ride is not in operation, please do not interfere with it, and under no circumstances should you walk through the attraction alone.
 
Reminder 3: If a man in a blue janitor’s uniform approaches you and asks you to “show him where the spill is,” just politely tell him that you are busy and start walking away. Make sure he is not following you before contacting park security.
 
Reminder 4: A nice man wearing a red apron can be seen on occasion walking around the park selling cotton candy. This man does not work for Amazing Amy’s Amusement Park. Don’t be fooled by his kind demeanor and don’t eat anything that he might be selling.
 
We realize that this job might seem difficult at times which is why the management here at Amazing Amy’s provides its workers with an hourly rate that is three dollars higher than the state’s minimum wage. It’s just our way of saying thank you to all the work that you guys provide for us on a daily basis. Because here at Amazing Amy’s Amusement Park, our staff is like family. If you have any questions regarding this email, or if you need more details involving the rules and regulations listed above please visit the tunnel located behind the bumper cars. Thank you.

I think I’m just going to call in sick tomorrow.
