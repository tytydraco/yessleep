I used to think that walking home late at night was calming. The streets were quieter, the city’s noise folded down to a low hum, and the lamps made the sidewalks look softer. I learned the rhythm of my route by heart. There was a coffee shop with a neon sign that blinked every other minute, a corner where three different smells met and argued, and an alley with graffiti that never changed. Nothing exciting, but it felt safe.

That changed last Tuesday.

I had stayed later than I wanted at a group project. The train came and went without me because I was sorting a file, so I decided to walk. It was maybe twenty minutes, same route I had taken hundreds of times. My phone had one bar and an exhausted battery, but I told myself I did not need to call anyone. I put my earbuds in, turned the music down so I could still hear the world, and started walking.

A few minutes in, I noticed something odd. My steps were the only sound for a bit, then another set of steps joined in behind me. Not loud, not close, just there. I looked back thinking I would see someone walking a dog or a couple laughing, but the street was empty. The lamp posts cast long cones of yellow light and the spaces between them were familiar pockets of shadow. No one walked in those pockets.

I shrugged. Maybe a delivery guy had taken a different turn. I kept walking.

The steps matched my pace, steady and even. When I slowed, they slowed. When I quickened, they quickened. It felt like walking with a metronome I could not turn off. I turned my head more than once and the shape of the street behind me remained the same. There was no silhouette, no shadow, nothing that looked like a person.

Then I saw the coat.

It was hung over a garbage bin by the coffee shop window, a dark coat with a raised collar. It should have been empty, a piece of clothing someone left. But something about the way the fabric lay made it read like it had shoulders, the bend of a neck. For a second I convinced myself it was a jacket on a hanger, then the jacket slid. Not across the pavement, not in a wind. It shifted like someone settling into it.

I stopped.

The footsteps stopped with me.

I told myself this was ridiculous. I told myself I had stayed up too late, that my brain was making patterns where there were none. I checked my phone. Forty percent. Fine. I started walking again, slower this time, the music louder so it could fill the space where nerves wanted to live. The steps returned.

I took a different street, the kind that cuts between two blocks and saves you three minutes. The short cut had a row of hedges and a single working lamp. I always passed it at this hour because a cab would sometimes park nearby and the driver would sleep with the radio on. Tonight there was no cab, no radio, only the lamp and the hedges. The footsteps sounded behind me like someone walking on a sidewalk that existed only for them.

When I glanced over my shoulder, I saw a figure reflected in the lit window of a closed shop. The reflection was only the suggestion of someone, a smear of dark that matched me step for step. It did not have the structure of a real person. It was like seeing yourself in water that someone was pulling the surface of.

I do not know what made me do it. Maybe it was panic or curiosity or both. I stopped and turned around fully, standing with my back straight and my feet planted. The air felt thicker, like someone had closed the distance between me and the night. Nothing moved in the alley. Nobody stepped into the light. The coat on the garbage bin remained dirtied and empty.

Then the first step landed behind me, right against the lip of my shoe. Not a second after. Close enough that the vibration felt through the concrete. I did not feel threatened exactly. I felt watched in the old, animal way you get when something that should be separate becomes close.

I said, “Hey, can you stop? I’m going home.”

The voice that answered was not a voice I heard. It was the knowledge that the footsteps had stopped because I had spoken. And then from somewhere behind the hedges, something moved and a shadow folded across the lamp’s light, eating the space where the path should be.

I turned and ran. The sound of my own breath came down hard in my throat. I passed the coffee shop where the coat had been, and the coat was gone. The neon sign flickered like a blink. My phone, which had been calm a moment before, flashed low battery and then black. I fumbled with keys, swearing, hands shaking.

My front door was stubborn. My neighbor had a key and always left the lock a little sticky. I jammed my thumb in the key, turned, and the door opened with a sound that felt loud enough to be heard down the whole block. I slammed it, leaned my back against it, and slid down to sit on the floor. The city sounded normal. The bus on the main road whooshed in the distance. A couple laughed two houses over. I told myself I was safe now.

That night I slept in fits. Each time I woke I could not move for a second because I was waiting for the sound I had learned to expect: steps behind me, slow and patient. They never came. At dawn I went to work like nothing had happened because what else do you do when you are nineteen and your rent is due and you need to be useful?

Over the next three days I altered my routes, walked with other people, and avoided the coffee shop altogether. The steps followed none of those changes. They seemed tied to me like a shadow that had a mind. I would be in line at the grocery store and the sound of footsteps would drift through my head the way an old song does. It was never loud, never urgent, but always precise in its timing.

On the fourth night I forgot to take my umbrella and it started to rain. The city smelled different with rain on the asphalt, cleaner. I walked slowly because the slick pavement took trust. Near the corner where the alley cut through, a man in a bright jacket stood under the same lamp I had passed before. He was holding a paper cup and staring at his phone. When I walked by he did not look at me. He never did.

The steps began again. They kept time.

I walked to the crosswalk and waited for the signal. The man in the jacket walked up to the curb, matching his pace to mine, and then he stopped. He did not cross. He stood two meters away from me and stared at his phone until the walk signal blinked. When we crossed, he turned down a different street and disappeared into an open doorway. I did not see where he went beyond that.

Later, in the shower, I realized the skin at the back of my neck was raised where a collar press might have been. I cannot say if something touched me that night or if I had imagined the pressure because fear can copy feeling as well as any hand can. But since then the steps have changed. I can only hear them when I am standing still. They come when I am alone in a room and waiting for the kettle to boil, when my headphones are in and the world has become private. When I move, they stop. When I stop, they begin.

I tried to tell someone. Laughed off the first two attempts. The third time I explained to my friend exactly how it felt and he said, “Sleep deprivation, man. Get some rest.” I still hear them.

Last week I walked to the subway with my jacket buttoned to my chin and my head down. A woman on the platform asked me the time and I told her, and she smiled and said thank you and that was that. When the train came she boarded and I took my spot at the back of the car. The doors closed and the lights hummed. I looked at my reflection in the window and, for a single second, I saw another reflection behind me in the glass, exactly the same height and shape as mine, but darker, as if someone had stood just off camera.

I turned. The car was empty except for a sleeping man in a suit. When I looked back at the window the other reflection was gone. My breath fogged the glass and a drop of condensation slid across where that shadow’s face might have been.

I cannot say why it follows me or what it wants. I can only say the rules seem simple: it keeps distance, it keeps time, and it only appears when I am still. For now I am trying not to stand in quiet places too long. I keep the kettle on until it whistles, I walk to my bus stop at a brisk pace, I take calls on the sidewalk.

And every so often, when the city gets very quiet and I am pretending that nothing is different, I hear a set of steps that match mine. They do not come closer. They do not speak. They are patient and precise, like someone practicing how to be invisible.

If you ever walk home and you hear a pair of steps behind you that always match your speed, do not stop to look for a face. Keep walking. Keep your phone alive. Keep moving. It feels selfish to say it, but I would rather live with the feeling of being followed than find out what happens when I stand still.
