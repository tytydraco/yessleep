It was finally winter break, my parents decided to go on a family road trip to our grandparents' house. We hadn't gone over there ever since grandfather passed away. It was so sudden and confusing. Grandfather was a very healthy man considering his age. He was his late 80's but still was as active as he was when mother was a small girl. Still as cheerful as ever..- or at least that's what mother said at the funeral. 

It was hard on everyone, but it was the hardest on grandmother. Grandfather and grandmother were high school sweet hearts. They went to the same university, graduated with honors, and got married right after graduating. Grandfather was a tall, muscular man, with features that could rival a professional model. Grandfather apparently landed a six figure job soon after graduating. Not a while after grandmother got pregnant and had mother. Mother was brought up in a multi-million dollar house that they had built from scratch. Mother got the finest of anything and everything that life had to offer. On top of that, grandfather supposedly was an amazing father and an amazing husband. Never missing any event or holiday, despite his busy schedule. People always used to say grandmother was the luckiest girl on earth. Everything about grandfather was perfect. No wonder everyone was devastated when my grandfather unexpectedly passed away.

After a couple hours of driving, we finally arrived at the mansion. Father and mother were pretty well off, but even our house did not compare to it. Grandma invited us in, excited that we had come to visit her. She seemed to be doing surprisingly well considering her life-long spouse had passed away suddenly about 2 weeks ago. Father and brother went to carry the bags from the car into the house, while grandmother ushered us inside. 

An immense sense of dread hit me as I stepped foot in the house. It was still as I remember. However the place that used to give me so much comfort, the place I had so many memories in, was suddenly giving me the urge to vomit.

However, the feeling lessened as soon as I entered the kitchen.

Grandmother had prepared spaghetti with meatballs for us, my favorite. I was always grandmother's favorite after all. The familiar smell washed away most of the feeling of dread. I excitedly grabbed some spaghetti and meatballs from the pot and sat down at the dinner table, As I picked up my fork, ready to dig into the delicious food that had been offered to me, mother yelled: 

"Dear! Be a little more patient. It's rude to not wait for your dad and brother!"

Grandma responded:

"Calm down, It is her favorite dish after all. I'm sure Mark and James wouldn't mind too much"

Mother responded, sighing:

"Fine, I'll allow it since it IS your favorite dish I guess"

Mother could never go against grandmother's word.

I smirked at mother, knowing that I had won. I happily stabbed my fork into a giant meatball, and stuffed it inside my mouth and started chewing. The sense of dread suddenly hit me again and I immediately spat out the meatball and ran to the bathroom. I finally caved into the urge to vomit.

Mother ran after me, holding up my hair as I threw up what was left of my breakfast and the snacks that I had in the car. I felt sick. 

After I was done, mother helped me up and lead me into my bedroom for the week. Grandmother soon entered with a glass of water and set it by my bedside table:

  
"How are you doing, sweetie?" She asked in a concerned tone. I replied:

"Better, I think the snacks I consumed finally caught up to me, combined with the long car ride."

"Hmm, I think that's the case too, sweetheart." Grandmother replied while looking into my eyes. 

A sinking feeling hit me. 

The once comforting and loving feeling I got looking into grandmother's old eyes , was now replaced with that same feeling of immense dread I've had ever since I entered the mansion. The more that I stared into her black eyes, the more I felt that feeling of dread expand. Mother soon came into the room, finally ending the staring match I was having with grandmother. 

"Are you feeling better?" mother asked. Before I could reply grandmother shot up and replied:

"She said she was feeling better, She should have dinner with us at the table!"

"I'm glad she's feeling better. But are you sure you can join us at the table, dear?" asked mother.

I was still feeling a bit sick, and that unsettling staring match with grandmother really discouraged that idea. 

"No, I still feel a bit sick, mother, grandmother. You guys have fun without me." 

Grandmother immediately flashed a disapproving glance in my direction and said:

"Are you sure? I worked so hard on preparing your favorite meal." 

I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine as grandmother was the most caring person I knew. Always put her own feelings last. But suddenly she seemed to care about a meal over her granddaughter's well being. This wasn't like her.

"I'm sorry grandmother, I don't think I can join you guys at dinner." 

Mother offered to bring my food up to me. And as much as I felt bad, knowing the effort it took for grandmother's poor old body to prepare such a meal, I declined. Mother said:

"Okay, I'll go set the dinner table then" and made her way downstairs. Grandmother was about to do the same when she suddenly stopped in the doorway, and yelled:

"Ungrateful child, I put in so much effort so that our family could be one with your grandfather forever." and stormed off as the realization of why grandfather’s funeral was closed casket finally set in.

First Post!! Hope it wasn’t too bad :))
