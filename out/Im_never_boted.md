I think the title says it all: I'm never bored, I never have been truly bored in my entire life, not that I can remember.  Not really bored.  Slightly bored of course, but not properly bored, because something always happens.

I do everything I can to avoid situations when I might be bored. These days, with Facebook and Reddit, not allowing myself to become bored has become easier, but before that, I needed strategies: note books, packs of cards, puzzle books: no matter where I was I would always ensure I had something to do.

It all started when I was about 11. I'd just started at a very British, old fashioned grammar school, with ancient buildings, and equally antiquated teaching techniques, and teachers.

I don't really remember it starting, but during tedious lessons, I would stare out of the window, and usually there would be a squirrel playing, running around, digging holes etc.. 

As I headed to my second year at that school, aged 12, the squirrels started to get more involved in lessons.  During history, they would sword fight with twigs, during biology, they mated with a surprising degree of enthusiasm.  I tried to tell people about it, but it was all put down to my over active imagination, and I was told I would grow out of it.

When my teachers caught me staring, they would close the blinds, or move me to another desk. When that happened, pigeons would start to appear above the high window of my classroom, and take over from the squirrels.  There was a murmuration of starlings that would put on aerial displays above the skylight.  One day the murmuration shape even spelled my name in massive letters, but still noone believed me.

This was all innocent, fun stuff. Animals doing slightly odd but harmless things, and after a while I stopped talking about it.  I didn't want to get bullied, and although the other kids saw some things, somehow they never really saw the fun stuff. 

I was a bit of a late developer, but eventually, my voice broke, and I had a much longed for growth spurt. And with it, my boredom time changed. It started slowly enough. Firstly, the squirrels started fighting.  Then a hawk appeared at the school. I'd grown out of sword fighting squirrels, quarreling pigeons, and even starlings who could spell my name, and seeing nature, raw in tooth and claw seemed cool, and that hawk - well it liked to show me what an effective hunter it was.

Then, one day, my family were stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway. My dad said this looked like a bad one and it would last ages, possibly hours, and we sat scarecely moving. I looked out of the window, hoping to see something interesting. There was a fox, on the hard shoulder, across the road where the traffic was running in the other direction. It almost looked like it waited until it was sure I was looking, then it casually strolled under the wheels of a passing van.  I vividly remember it's blood spraying all over a nearby car. I looked on in horror, as further up the road another fox appeared, and stared at me, like it was waiting. 

This one didn't die instantly, it lay, screaming by the side of the road for what seemed like hours, until a passing lorry swerved and put it out of it's misery.

I don't recall the rest of that interminable day. The roadside casualties mounted, and I started to realise with horror that it was only when I was watching. At some point I realised I had to do something: I ran to the back of the car, and got a book out of the back, which I read without looking up, and the casualties stopped:  the traffic started moving soon afterwards.

The final term at school was the worst.  I had always found history tedious, but now there were workmen on scaffolding. After the first few unexpected accidents ( a broken arm, then a broken leg, and then a brick falling on someones head causing concussion even through his hard hat). I realised I couldn't look out of the window. I had to stay focused, or just stare at my desk. 

To start with, that worked. That was until the entire scaffolding collapsed when I glanced up, after ages spent desperately staring at the floor, and trying to count the number of times my teacher said "umm".

Once I finished school, things got better. I got a Walkman, and I discovered talking books in the library. At the time, they were mainly for the blind, but the librarian let me borrow them. 

That plan lasted until a long train journey, when the batteries in my Walkman died, and I finished my book.  That day, a man in my carriage had a choking incident, and the automatic train door malfunctioned, so that it would keep hitting people until someone fell and broke their arm.  

Things got a bit better in my twenties. I met the woman who would become my wife, had two lovely kids, and I almost forgot about my boredom problems. That was until my son ended up in hospital: it was nothing major, but I had to stay with him, with nothing to do.  Once again, it started harmlessly: a Lego model a kid was working on collapsed on to him, then a stray dog ran into the hospital causing chaos. It seemed harmless, but I knew what was happening.

After that, I took more care. I've had a few incidents over the years, each one slightly worse than the previous. I've seen car crashes and a train derailment.  But it wasn't until I was nearly 40, that people started to die. 

The first was during a particularly tedious performance by my daughters orchestral group, which had to be halted, after their conductor had a cardiac arrest on stage.

Over time the deaths started to get more gruesome, and after that, they came closer to home.  I witnessed a colleague get fatally hit by a car crossing the road near my office.  Then a friend was trapped inside a burning car wreck, and and burned to death as I sat nearby, stuck on a stationary train. He shouldn't even have been in the area, but a road got flooded, and he was diverted right past where my train was stopped.

Not only do the incidents get worse, but somehow the world finds ways to trap me with nothing to do.  Batteries die, trains and planes get delayed, drinks get spilled on my book, and the deaths keep getting closer.  

I've cut myself off from everyone I love.  I've pushing my wife away, who took the kids with her, and I've moved deep into the countryside away from everyone.  I dare not ever see my kids, or let my wife know how much I still love her.

I keep myself constantly busy in my seclusion with manual tasks to ensure I sleep well, along with subscriptions to every streaming service, and every talking book service I can.  I keep 3 mobile phones fully charged at all times, each connected to a different network, just so I will always have something to do.

The previous time all my strategies failed was 2 years ago. On that occasion, a small plane mistook the road for a runway, and the ensuing fireball killed a lot of people.

And now, I'm trapped again.  During one of my rare trips to the local town to get the few supplies I can't get over the internet, I was involved in an accident: I don't know if that's part of what happens to me, or just bad luck.

Now, I'm lying here, in a hospital bed, with nothing to do, unable to move my head.  So far, 6 people on my ward have died, with ever more bizarre causes, and now they've moved my bed near a window, where I can see planes taking off from the airport in the distance.  I've tried not to look out of the window, but with my neck in a brace I can't help it.  There's nothing to do: no radio, no talking book, and I'm already getting bored.
