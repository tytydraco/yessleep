I got a job assembling Ikea furniture, my job came with a  strange list of instructions. I know these types of stories are generally about an employee who unknowingly enters into employment under a supernatural business, but i was a researcher looking for the secret to finding proof of God, and what I found has brought more to light than I ever could have imagined and the key to it all, was the meatballs. Ingvar Kamprad may be seen as the pioneer of efficient furniture and household accessories but what they won't tell you is that he never existed. The true story of Ikea is not even of Ikea but of väktare av den antika giganten. Ingvar was a disciple of the founder of the cult in question, but his real name couldn't be found and it's called into question whether that's part of the conspiracy. But from what our foundation was able to gather, väktare av den antika giganten was a cult that kept the location of a god sealed somewhere in northern Sweden. We found a transcript from a scroll found in a jar in a dried out well in Kebnekaise, a mountain range 166 kilometers north of the Arctic circle. It was written in what was discovered to be human blood and the donor in question was discovered holding the jar having been fossilized in an unknown substance similar to amber but more gelatinous. The translation is as follows;


       I don't know how to get the word out as the infection has already gotten so severe, I can barely move. When I am exposed to light, I feel like I'm on fire. I was on my way to deliver a letter when day broke and I had to hide in this godforsaken well. I was a spy looking into a group of religious zealots called the keepers of the ancient behemoth. They must have discovered my notes I had been sending back to Russia and they poisoned my food. Something in the meat I consumed tasted off. It was like spices mixed with soaked bread. It was the most incredible thing I had ever tasted and when I ate it, I had no choice but to eat more. When I had eaten my full, they put a hood over me and left me in the field outside their meeting place tied to a post. I managed to break free and got my bag hidden nearby to flee before the sickness took hold. They are trying to release a god and I don't know how but I fear I will not be able to find out or return home. Goodbye.


    At the time the note was written, there were no buildings with a sizable dining hall and political ties to be on the scale of a large group meeting but there was a mining operation in the mountains. With this knowledge we were able to narrow the area the group operated in at the time to a town in Kiruna. Upon further investigation we were able to trace a paper trail that led to the caymans, but one well placed bribe led us to Ikea. I was the agent sent to investigate the location closest to ascertain the location of the behemoth. I don't know what my group wants it for but I do know I wouldn't be alive now if I was one to ask questions and if I wasn't one to get results so I'll do what I have to. I was given a list of strange devices to install in soda machines and insert into different instruments around the restaurant as well as organize raids on Ikea trucks to steal shipments of furniture. I was raised by the organization and only had MREs until now. One day in the food court, I tried the meatballs and what I felt was the same as the description in the dead spy's scroll. I have found traces of a chemical found in the amber in the meatballs served at the location I had been sent to. I won't reveal the location or my name for obvious reasons. What I can say is what I have had to do as part of my job has led me to realize that Ikea is just a part of this and it will take further investigation to uncover the truth. I will keep you posted.
