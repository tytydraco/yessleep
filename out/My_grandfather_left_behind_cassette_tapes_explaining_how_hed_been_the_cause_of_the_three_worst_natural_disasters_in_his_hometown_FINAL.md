One month.

One whole fucking month.

Honestly, I’m surprised with myself for writing this. 

I could’ve just let this whole thing die…but nope.

I just had to finish it.

I have to write this if I ever want to feel closure.

First of all, I apologize for taking so long.

I actually listened to “RAVEN” only a few days after my last post.

On Halloween believe it or not (and no, the irony is not lost on me).

What happened on that day, I have to say, will stay with me for the rest of my life.

A part of me wishes I could have done this sooner just to get it out of the way, but I didn’t.

The indescribable aura it seemed to exude made me subconsciously put off listening to it. 

I replied and answered to all of your comments and I have to say that I was disappointed that they stopped.

I wished they would have come in droves so that I would never have to listen to the third tape, that I could’ve just put the box back in my closet and have whoever would move in my old house finish this story for me.

But when I had no excuse to distract me from my responsibility, I realized that I had to do it.

And what better day than when ghosts and monsters freely walk among us.

I still remember it like it was yesterday.

I’m only writing this now, today, in the dead of night, because I haven’t been able to sleep, and if I want to ever do so, I must get this out there now, so here it goes:

On the day in question, there were no trick or treaters, as a very large storm had hit my area.

There was a power shortage because why not, and as if things couldn’t get unnerving enough, here I was listening to this accursed tale at twilight, just when the storm hit.

The tempo of the ponderous rain gave this tale a rhythm that has left it engrained in me like an ear worm, and made it all the harder to forget.

On my lonely sofa chair I sat, in the middle of my silent living room, where barely a decade prior I had been a child playing with toys and watching cartoons, and now found myself listening to a tale that I knew deep down would shake me to my very core.

Before I let you read my grandfather’s last words recorded on that tape, I must say that I will forever cite this past Halloween as the day that I truly lost my innocence and understood the bleak truth that our mistakes – just one moment of carelessness – doesn’t just hurt us, but it can hurt the people that we love most, even when we don’t want to.

The following is the story in “RAVEN” which left me numb for a week, crying for another, silent for one more, and sleepless up until now.

*“Did you know, David, that a group of ravens is called ‘unkindness’?*

*I certainly didn’t…and when someone told me this on an unassuming day when I couldn’t have cared more, I felt my chest tighten and my heart ache like never before. You’d been born into this world not three days ago, and I thought of you as I collapsed on the floor.* 

*Since that day, what I have gone through, especially the incident I am about to recount, has never left me for one single moment.*

*The only days when it would leave me alone would be when we would be together, doing whatever, and those have truly been the greatest days of my life.*

*Days that I will always cherish in this life and in the next.*

*But after this…I can understand if you won’t.*

*I’m not a good person David.* 

*That much I’m sure you’ve already gathered.*

*After all that had happened, you’d think that I would’ve remembered.*

*But no.*

*I forgot as well.*

*Even when I would wear Ferguson’s scarf every single damn day of the year, the memory of him and Rosanne faded again.*

*Burn to ashes and drowned deep in the annals of my mind, you could say.*

*It’s funny how the mind works against you.*

*I forgot about them on the conscious level, but they still haunted me in the subconscious one.*

*I was cold, both emotionally and physically, and I would always wear a red scarf, even during the summer, and so, given this, as well as my past, it’s a wonder and a miracle that I somehow found love.*

*Dear lord…*

*Before you came along David, this memory was all I had that kept my neck out of a noose. That and the others that followed.*

*It was a cold December night, and I was at a local bar drinking my fourth beer in under half an hour.*

*It was a dingy place, but it was near campus, so who could complain?*

*There weren’t that many people with me that night – just a few classmates playing pool and throwing darts while the rustiest speakers I have yet to hear be outmatched played the song of a worn-out vinyl disc.*

*In the days before these smartphones which are everywhere now, this was as good as distractions from life got.*

*There is something that scares me though.*

*On that day, I was ready to pass out at any given moment, and had what came next happened a moment sooner, I would’ve very well woken up the next day and gone about my life in the bleak direction it was heading to.*

*But the voice came just before I was about to pass to the other side of the coin of consciousness, and I will never dare forget it for as long as I live.*

*‘I’d ask you to buy me a drink, but I’m concerned that it’ll be empty by the time you hand it to me.’*

*Those are the words I would have expected an angle to tell me David.*

*They are what saved me.*

*I gained some lucidity and focused my eyes and, although still groggy as all hell, I saw a woman that would’ve otherwise appeared average and unassuming to anyone else, but to me, she radiated brighter than anything or anyone I had ever encountered before.*

*I think I felt this way because eye contact was the very first thing I made with her, the soul she held withing herself splashing against mine like an arctic wave which instantly sobered me up.*

*That night will forever remain with me, etched and burned in my battered heart, because after I had regained all of my wits, I bought her the beer she wanted, and we, to my great surprise, talked.*

*And so we talked.*

*And talked.*

*And talked.*

*And before we knew it, the sun shined through a window, and we had yet to stop talking.*

*She left, and I thought that would be the last time I would ever see or hear from her again, as we had forgotten to exchange our contact information.*

*Even that night would have been enough for me, but when I went to class after Christmas break was over, my heart almost stopped in my chest when I sat down in the seat I always sat in, turned to my right for a reason I have yet to remember, and saw her looking straight at me, with a look just as surprised as mine.*

*She was a foreign student who had come to the U.S. for her graduate work, and we were both working towards our masters in Chemical engineering.*

*What followed were the most blissful years of my life.*

*Both of us graduated and, as I’m sure you have already guessed, we then got married.*

*My life truly could not have been better.*

*We had a beautiful daughter and a…beautiful boy.*

*\*Silence for five seconds\**

*A house in the newly rebuilt Fulkron on top of a hill that overlooked all.*

*A life where every day I woke up next to the most beautiful and smartest woman that I knew, whom I loved with every bit of me.*

*A life where I got to make Ferguson’s pancakes and other dishes for my children, recipes which remained engraved within me.*

*Nothing could have been better.*

*But…*

*\*Audible hesitation for ten seconds, paired with audible shuffling about\**

*But…there soon and unexpectedly came a day that all husbands fear and have nightmares about, but don’t realize until it has already hit them.*

*When it’s too late, that is.*

*I don’t know how old you are while listening to this David, but even you have to understand that a wife isn’t supposed to stay out all night and come back only at the crack of dawn.*

*You have to understand that a wife isn’t supposed to spend long hours talking on the phone instead of talking to you.*

*You really do have to understand that a husband should never have to find a sensual love letter in his wife’s purse with hand writing that differs from his own.*

*It really is funny and cruel how you never see these things coming until it’s too late.*

*It always leaves you wondering how you could’ve been so blind and why you never did the things you had to do to prevent it from happening.*

*Did I not give her enough attention?*

*Did I fail to satisfy her?*

*Should we have held off on having children?*

*Questions like these shredded the insides of my skull every single waking moment of my existence, and the more time passed, the number I felt, until one day, that numbness changed.*

*It became the feeling I had grown to subconsciously fear and numb with booze so that it would never resurface again.*

*Anger.*

*Blinding anger.*

*Rage so strong and potent you would have damn well thought it had been distilled from the venom of a snake from hell.*

*On a cloudy day, on a date which I will never remember, right before lunch, while my two beautiful children sat inside the house, I confronted my wife outside.*

*I’ll spare you the details because, honestly, I don’t remember them myself.*

*All I remember is this incredible feeling of frustration welling and building up inside of me.*

*A feeling so powerful that when the urge to sneeze that sneeze came upon me, I paid it no attention.*

*I just remember opening my mouth, shouting the words that had poisoned my mind since that day when I found out the truth.*

*But nothing came out.*

*Nothing came out for reasons you will understand at a time that is not now.*

*I opened my mouth, my wife with her arms crossed, and although no words came out, I saw them, David. I swear I saw those hateful and spiteful words shake the air, and it was at that moment that I let out the most powerful sneeze yet.*

*It collided with the air that was meant to carry my silent words, and in a flash, faster than one blinks, a raven appeared out of nowhere.*

*Both of us were startled, and as the screeching bird flew up and up and up, the memories slowly dripped back and back and back, until it all came down me with the force of a brick; the consequences of my actions and what was sure to follow hitting me harder than when I discovered that my amazing wife had been unfaithful to me.*

*That didn’t matter anymore.*

*I realized that the moment that raven disappeared in the dark clouds above.*

*Something bad was coming.*

*Something worse than a tidal wave.*

*Something worse than a forest fire.*

*Something worse than any natural disaster, and the worst part is that it came out of my own unkind actions; born out of words of spite.*

*Nothing happened at first, which is why we hesitated to move, something that I regret to this day.*

*I knew damn well something was coming, but my legs just wouldn’t move because my eyes saw no danger yet.*

*Then it started.*

*The clouds above began to twist and churn and collapse into themselves.*

*And that’s when I saw them.*

*Their cries gave them away.*

*Dark and stormy ravens started to descend down in the distance, where the black raven had first gone up into the clouds.*

*They flew around and around and around like a merry go round, like vultures circling their meal, and it’s not until they touched the ground and didn’t stop going around that I realized what I had unleashed upon the world.*

*A tornado.*

*The tornado of all tornadoes.*

*To give you an idea, David, of how massive that tornado made of ravens was, I’ve come face to face with 2013 El Tornado, and I remember that everyone would ask me how I could be so fearless in front of something so terrifying.*

*The truth was that I felt no fear, because that tornado was positively puny and insignificant compared to what descended from the sky that day that I am telling you about.*

*The Bible was wrong David.*

*Hell would not come from below.*

*It came from above, where the heavens were always meant to be.*

*Retribution that had been brought forth by my unforgiving and unforgivable wrath.*

*It truly was a nightmare to behold.*

*Nothing mattered at that moment.*

*Our spat was nothing.*

*All that mattered was getting the children out and somewhere safe.*

*The wind was pulling everything towards that…that monster that was swiftly approaching.*

*My wife rushed to start the car, and I rushed into the house and grabbed my two small children.*

*When I ran out, I rushed to get to the car, the inhaling gale so strong and powerful it’s a miracle I myself didn’t fly away, but as I ran, I felt my son be pulled further and further away from me.*

*The tornado was pulling him from me, and it’s only later that I realized why.*

*I held onto his thin arm with all my strength, but my rage was too powerful.*

*I felt his arm dislocate, and I had no choice but to let go.*

*After all…what need would I have had for the amputated left arm that I was gripping so tightly at that point?*

*Adrenaline was what made me and my wife press on, while your mother, small as she was, cried hysterically for her brother.*

*We sped down the country road, and behind the rear-view mirror, the unkindness grew larger and larger.*

*I kept apologizing like a man in fervent prayer, somehow hoping that would make it go away, but I then realized the horrible truth.*

*It wouldn’t go away.*

*It would never go away.*

*It would grow larger and larger and larger until would take my wife, churning and ripping the entire world to shreds if that’s what it took.*

*Only then would its hunger be satisfied.*

*But I couldn’t let that happen.*

*I didn’t want that to happen.*

*I prayed for that to never happen.*

*But the car was running out of gas.*

*The entire town was once again being destroyed into nothingness..*

*The bogeyman had trapped us in a nightmare that even the sandman had no hope of saving us from.*

*There were no good or bad choices, nor right or wrong.*

*My wife asked me if it would go away.*

*I told her that it wouldn’t until it had her.*

*To this day I wonder if I told her that on purpose, or if I truly did it because I failed to pay attention.*

*All I know is that my wife, the woman who had saved me so long ago, and who despite her faults had always been by my side for the longest of times and always took care of our children, walked out of the car, and I didn’t stop her.* 

*Your mother cried and wailed in the backseat.*

*She pounded on the glass with such force that her tiny hands cracked the damn thing, and all the while, I stood in silence, and said nothing.*

*I only cried.*

*My wife approached the tornado, miles away but so large it might as well have been less than a hundred meters of distance between us.*

*I saw her stride towards it as if out on a pleasant walk, and instead of being sucked away as though a window had been opened in the vacuum of space, like my son, she merely levitated up from the ground and was slowly pulled in like an angel during Rapture.*

*The ravens sawed and grinded her into nothingness when she passed their threshold, liked winged piranhas, and then, in less time than it takes to blink, the tornado itself, more like the ugly chimera of a volcanic cyclone and a hellish hurricane, ceased abruptly.*

*It was as if someone had been holding their breath, and suddenly let it go.*

*That’s how instantaneous it was.*

*A mountain of debris fell down to the ground, and so did I.*

*I fell to my knees, and wondered why I had killed all of my loved ones.*

*What had they done that was so bad as to warrant death besides knowing me?*

*Was this a sign that I was cursed and never meant to have happiness?*

*Why didn’t I die with them?*

*Why was I spared?*

*Why was I left to feel what I felt?*

*Why couldn’t death have numbed me?*

*\*Audible crying\**

*Why them and not me?*

*Why did I have to feel pain for things that I never wanted?*

*Did I want them?*

*Was that the truth?*

*Was that why Rosanne sacrificed herself?*

*Was that why Ferguson sacrificed himself?*

*Was that why my wife sacrificed herself?*

*Why couldn’t it have been me?*

*Why didn’t I have the courage to sacrifice myself so that all these people greater than me shouldn’t have had to?*

*These questions never left me from that day and onward, David.*

*They seeped through every fold of my brain, no matter how much time had passed, never once losing their toxic potency.*

*My daughter, you mother, Rosanne, had become a shell of herself.*

*She would ask where her younger brother, Ferguson, was and I could never find the heart to tell her.*

*We no longer cried.*

*Our eyes had long since dried.*

*It all came to a breaking point when one night I went to Rosanne’s room, and I saw how she twisted and moaned and cried tearlessly in her bed.*

*I put my hand on her for comfort, but she pulled away as if I had wiped garbage on her.*

*I staggered into the kitchen and once again fell on the floor, my tears finally coming out after so long and spilling on the dirty marble below.*

*The sneeze came…and I wished for a monster that would put both of us out of our misery.*

*I started to cry more and more, years’ worth of tears gathering and mixing with my pitiful snot.*

*I cried more than any human should.*

*I only stopped crying when I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.*

*I looked up, and my wife stood in front of me, as radiant as she had always been.*

*After a reassuring smile, she walked into our daughter’s room, and tucked her in.*

*Rosanne stopped whimpering, and after such a long time, the suffering she never once deserved was alleviated, and sleep free of nightmares and pain finally descended upon her.*

*I embraced her, and although she felt real, sounded real, and was real, I knew she wasn’t real.*

*…*

*I left not long after.*

*All your mother knows is that she was an only child, her mother was still alive and we had*  *divorced one day and I moved out, never to be seen again.*

*I went back to Fulkron.*

*I went back to the forest, and there, I found Ferguson’s cabin untouched by any molten claws of wispy and serrated beaks.*

*They very cabin that you would always come to during summer, where we spent so much time together and had so much fun exploring the plentiful woods around it.*

*The one with the trophy mount of a bear head which you were always frightened off, the one I would always tell you belonged to a great big monster that was once killed by a hero who lived in the very cabin you would tuck yourself in for sleep every single night.*

*You saved me David.*

*As I sit here in my lonely cabin, near the end of my life, I am filled with nothing short of gratitude for having had you by my side at a time when my soul should have known only suffering as retribution for all that I had caused.*

*Those days where it was just you and me will be ones that I, as I mentioned before, will forever remember, in this life while I am still a part of it, and in the other where I shall shortly find myself in, and be it in heaven or hell or limbo, I will never forget my first love, my first father, my first son, my first wife, and you David, my first grandchild, the one I know will grow up to be a healthy, strong, and dependable man – the man I could never be when I needed to.*

*Don’t be afraid of growing up David.*

*Take care of your family and loved ones in the way I never could.*

*Live a long and fulfilling life.*

*Have no regrets.*

*Fear be damned, as should the words of all the idiots you’ll meet during the long, long life you will have.*

*Enjoy every day, and never take any of them for granted.*

*You will meet many people who will not love you, but just know, that I have always loved you and always will, no matter what.*

*Goodbye David.*

*I love you.*

*I’m sorry but I must leave now.*

*I must go and pay the price for having the means of leaving you these words.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And that’s what happened.

I woke up the next day and it was morning outside.

The storm had stopped while I was asleep and while the tape was still playing in my ears.

I was still seated in my sofa chair.

All I can say is that I initially felt utter numbness, and as the memories of what had been said on the tape trickled in, each word somehow falling deep in my sleeping mind, I feel no shame in admitting that I started to cry as all the memories I had forgotten of my grandfather came flooding back; all the time we’d spent together and all the adventures we’d had.

Having to write this transcript required me to listen to the tape again, and those same feelings rushed back into me all over again.

Even when I could barely see from the tears, I still typed faithfully.

And that’s the end of my grandfather’s story. 

But there’s one more reason as to why it took me so long to write this story.

After transcribing the tape above and having to listen to it for the second time (which took all that I had in me to be able to write what it said the same time), I gathered all of the tapes, all four of them, along with the recorder, and went to put them back in the box from which they came from. 

I was prepared to end this post with my grandfather’s words, not mine.

But when I went over to the box from where the tapes came from, I noticed that its bottom was white and somewhat weathered.

I reached my hand in, and pulled out the photograph which had been lying face down in its bottom this whole entire time.

A broad man stood in the picture with (who I presumed to be) his wife, and two small children, a boy and a girl, all four staring at the camera with vague smiles on their faces.

The boy I did not recognize at all, the little girl I recognized as my mother, the broad man as my grandfather, and the woman in the picture as the same woman who had given me the audio cassettes so long ago at his funeral.

The same woman whom had supposedly died before my grandfather had.

But that’s not all that happened.

One more thing did happen.

Something that, like the words of my dear grandfather, will forever stain my mind till I too one day become dust.

A truth I had forgotten for so long until one faithful phone call made it resurface, like the RMS Titanic emerging from its oceanic grave back to the surface.

It happened after work.

I was numb.

The tapes still plagued my mind.

And that’s when I decided to call my mother.

She picked up, and we talked awkwardly.

Eventually, after a while, the conversation naturally drifted to my grandfather.

I could feel a hint of hesitation in my mother’s voice, but she had no overt apprehension when it came to talking about him.

She told me about all the fun things that we did together, all of the things that I could remember, and I don’t quite know how, but I ended up asking a question.

A question which procured the answer I will never forget, as I mentioned before, even after death.

“Mom?”

“Yes sweetie?”

“What kind of bed time stories would grandpa read to me before bed?” 

“…”

“…Mom?”

“Honey…your…your grandfather never read you any bed time stories.”

“Oh…And why’s that? I’m pretty sure he told me one about a bear once.”

“…David, honey, don’t you remember?”

“Remember what?”

“Your grandfather…he was born mute.”

My finger moved as if it had a mind of its own and ended the call.

Only one thing passed through my mind after it had registered these words, and those were my grandfather’s final words:

*I must go and pay the price for having the means of leaving you these words instead of letters.*

Grandpa…

I hope that all you had to give up to talk to me was only your life, and nothing else.

I hope that it was simply a miracle given to you by God.

I hope that you know that I love you too, with all of my heart.

I hope that you’re in a better place now with Grandma, Ferguson, and Rosanne.

Thank you for all of the memories that I will never forget.

Thank you, grandpa.

My only regret is only ever telling you that I loved you with hand signs instead of words out of my mouth, because I was a stupid kid who didn’t understand that just because you were mute didn’t mean that you were also deaf.

I’m sorry for that grandpa.

I hope that you’re resting in the peace you always wished for.

I love you.

I always have and I forever will.

I hope that tonight I will dream of you, that we will be fishing together with our stomachs full of pancakes, talking with our voices instead of with our hands, our eyes glued to the sunset that could only ever be found in that lake and nowhere else, ready to go back to that quiet Cabin and have a night of sleep that I could never get anywhere else.

I give you one final thanks for imparting in me a love I will never forget from now on, and will be sure to pass onto my children, and my grandchildren, and maybe even my great grandchildren, so that they may pass it onto their grandchildren as well. 

May you sleep tight, and may you sleep well.

I know I will.

All thanks to you and the memories you have given me.

Memories I will always see when I close my eyes from this day forth.

Goodnight grandpa.

And sweet dreams.
