In 1978, a late-night television broadcast of unknown origin aired on a public access channel serving the state of Missouri. No records of the broadcast exist. Witness testimony is all that remains.

The only concrete details regarding the broadcast include the following:

The show aired at 11:45 PM on a Wednesday evening in October

The name of the show was “More Than God is Here”

The host was a man called Reverend Moore. 

The content of the broadcast is less easy to determine. 

Different witnesses offered different descriptions.

One viewer claimed the show contained a vision of heaven itself.

Another insisted it was a standard televangelist grift.

Several more said the host spoke directly to them, addressing them by name through the screen, offering words of comfort and promises of a prosperous future just so long as they followed him.

A dozen viewers the content was a rousing sermon that galvanized and renewed their faith.

Others reported to have seen a man peeling his face off and leering into the camera. One witness went so far as to claim that the show host reached out of the television set with “hideous dead hands” and told her the end of the world was coming, but that he would save her if she would just take his hand.

As previously noted, no record of the broadcast exists. However, records of the response to the show are extant. Letters of complaint, praise, and question remain on file, maintained to this day by the owner of the now-defunct station. 

With the owner’s permission, the Agency made copies of all correspondence related to the broadcast. These copies remain with the Agency, and are available to review on request. (Please note that the Agency of Helping Hands has determined that the owner knows nothing of Notgod More, and simply keeps the correspondence due to the “local folklore” factor.) 

“More Than God is Here” continued to air Wednesday nights at 11:45PM. 

Interestingly, the longer the show aired, the more cohesive viewers’ memories became. By the eighth episode, the recollections of witnesses are similar enough that the Agency is confident each individual saw — or at least perceived — the same broadcast. (Why there were such disparities in recollections in the first place is still not known.) Detailed accounts and abridged summaries of the episodes are available upon request. 

 Under the circumstances, it is important to note that the otherwise lacking illusion of Notgod More’s humanity appears flawless on camera. For reasons the Agency has been unable to determine, any and every part of him appears perfectly human when photographed, videoed, or even simply viewed through a camera lens. This phenomenon undoubtedly allowed him to cultivate his popularity. 

The show continued to air for a year. The one-year anniversary episode of “More Than God is Here” ended with the host, Reverend Moore, inviting his viewers to meet him in the flesh next Wednesday at 11:45PM at a local lake. 

Despite the strangeness of the day, hour, and the request itself, it is estimated that approximately seventy people turned up to meet Reverend Moore. 

Witness accounts are difficult to digest, each seemingly more fantastical and horrifying than the last. The one component on which all accounts agree is that this was an evening of miracles both great and terrible, an evening so profoundly spectacular that ended with an awestruck attendee asking the question that was on everyone’s mind by that point: 

“Are you God?”

To which the reverend responded, “I’m not God. I’m more.” 

What followed his pronouncement led to the creation of an off-grid cult dedicated to this copper-eyed miracle worker of unknown origin. 

A miracle worker and a god he may have been, but generous he was not. According to even his most devoted follower, Notgod was a demanding lord. In exchange for his miracles and favor, followers were required to surrender their money, belongings, dwellings, even their loved ones if Notgod asked. Those who did were rewarded beyond comprehension (or so it is claimed; to date, no witnesses have been able to provide concrete details regarding these rewards, and no evidence of any reward bestowed by Notgod More is known to exist.) 

Those who did not give what they were instructed to surrender were eaten. 

Notgod More’s diet was limited indeed: He drank lake water and cannibalized his less cooperative followers, who were butchered according to a specific ritual that involved all members of his cult. The ritual ended with Notgod More eating the brain and heart of the victim, then requiring his followers to consume the rest of the carcass.

The Agency possesses a full recording of one such ritual. Access is subject to clearance and permission from both Dr. Hyde and the requestor’s chain of command. 

Notgod More came to the Agency’s attention when a teenage escapee from the cult reported him to local police. The report was dismissed. As a minor, the witness was remanded to state custody. Due to the horrors he had witnessed, the youth was not able to achieve mental stability and as a result was eventually incarcerated at a secure inpatient facility.

From there, his story wound its way through the institution and eventually reached a Varangian agent whose prompt attention to the matter led the Agency to the compound of Notgod More. 

The details of the scene remain classified to this day, and as of this writing there are no plans to declassify them. Suffice to say the condition of Notgod More’s cult was so dire and the threat posed by setting them free so uniquely critical that—for the first and only time in Agency history— Administration issued an order to terminate each and every human being onsite. 

Agency personnel attempted to terminate Notgod More alongside his followers, but were unsuccessful. Fortunately, they were able to capture and transport him to the North American Pantheon, where he remains to this day.

Notgod More has alternately described himself as “Not God,” “The Worm in the Heart of the World,” “Your Destroyer,” “Their Creator,” and “The Nemesis Star.” He has not elaborated on any of these descriptors. However, it should be noted that Dr. Wingaryde has made a measurable amount of progress with him over the years.

To summarize, Notgod More is the chosen name of an entity that located, collected, and to an extent “farmed” his victims by employing the novel strategy of masquerading as a prosperity gospel televangelist. 

As is the case with several inmates in our care, the Agency has no idea what Notgod More actually is, where he came from, the true extent of his capabilities, or his motivations.

Here is what the Agency of Helping Hands does know: 

Upon casual inspection, Notgod More appears to be a middle-aged man of generally nondescript appearance with dark hair, a practiced smile, and notably bright eyes. He is partial to dark suits, shiny brown shoes, and a lightly feathered haircut that somewhat, if not perfectly, recalls styles that were popular in the United States in the 1970s. 

However, the normalcy of his appearance is entirely illusory. The longer and more closely one looks, the thinner the illusion becomes. 

Notgod More loves to speak. He is extremely charismatic and can easily mesmerize individuals as well as crowds, sometimes instantaneously. For this reason, all personnel assigned to Notgod More are issued with specialized ear protection and eyewear.

Immediate distraction of his targets is necessary because Notgod More is always smiling, and his teeth are the first major indicator that he is not human. He has front-facing “masking teeth” teeth that look like standard adult teeth. However, behind the masking teeth on both the upper and lower jaws are a set of short, small, excessively sharp teeth that curve back toward his throat. 

His eyes are the second indicator. Notgod More’s eyes appear bright brown at first glance, and appear so at all times to subjects under his influence. In reality, however, they are a highly unusual copper hue with mild reflective properties. While “humanity” is a difficult quality to quantify, it cannot be argued that this quality is missing from Notgod More’s eyes, which are very bright, very flat, and constantly moving. 

The skin of his face is the third indicator. While healthy-looking and natural for a man of the age he is projecting, Notgod More’s flesh veers into the uncanny valley in two areas: at the corners of the mouth, where observers note a peculiar “pinned” appearance, and around the eyes, where it is unnaturally loose in a way that recalls (as one agent described it) “a starched shirt that’s way too big.” 

The fourth indicator is the appearance of his hands. While the skin visible elsewhere on Notgod More’s body is a normal, healthy color, his hands are discolored. The tops are a uniform middling grey hue with a greenish aspect, while the bottoms are swollen and dark purple – that is, livid.

In other words, Notgod More has the hands of a corpse. 

Despite the myriad dangers and difficulties posed by Notgod More, Agency command is tentatively hopeful that Dr. Wingaryde’s collaboration with the organization’s newly-commissioned T-Class agent will produce new and important insights into the entity’s origins, abilities, and motivations, and hopefully provide information that can eventually be used to terminate him. 

That Notgod More must be terminated is not up for debate. However, other aspects of his case remain up for debate. Those questions must be answered prior to his termination.

As an Agnosto-class inmate with a highly localized impact radius and a bizarrely specific modus operandi, the acuity of the threat Notgod More poses remains uncertain. The Agency knows that the inmate poses critical danger on a small scale, but does not know whether that scale represents the extent of his capabilities or whether it is – for lack of a better term – merely a taster. 

Dr. Wingaryde is of the opinion that the truth is closer to the latter than the former. Command agrees as of this writing, and has issued the official opinion that Notgod More’s actions with his cult were essentially an opening salvo, perhaps even a game.

In the best case scenario, the actions taken by the entity were nothing but a minor distraction, the equivalent of a mean-spirited child using a magnifying glass to burn ants on a slow summer afternoon.

Unfortunately, the Agency must always prepare for the worst-case scenario rather than the best. For Notgod More, the worst case scenario is that he was merely practicing for a much larger and more significant conquest.

Unfortunately, the answer to the question of his underlying motivation remains unanswered.

It is the Agency’s hope that this answer, as well as many others, will find resolution during the inmate’s scheduled interview with the agency’s new T-Class interviewer.

Whatever his motivation and whatever his origin, Notgod More’s considerable power of influence over large numbers of human beings makes him critically dangerous for many reasons. It is therefore imperative that he remains constantly monitored and heavily guarded until the moment it is safe to terminate him. 

Due to the critical threat posed by this entity, Dr. Charles Wingaryde was originally scheduled to attend the examination alongside the interviewer. However, as Dr. Wingaryde is currently indisposed pending the outcome of his recent disciplinary review, the interviewer was instead accompanied by Commander Rafael Wingaryde and his T-Class partner Christophe Wolf.

It should be noted that their attendance occurred over the interviewer’s strenuous objections. 

**INTERVIEW SUBJECT: NOTGOD MORE**

***Classification String: Noncooperative / Indestructible / Agnosto / Constant\* / Moderate / Daemon\*\* \*Presumed but unconfirmed***  
***\*\*Under Review*** 

**INTERVIEWER: RACHELE B.**

**DATE:  11/23/24**

People say love makes the world go round.

They are wrong.

Desire makes the world go round.

Power is the engine, desire its fuel. Love plays no part in either. If I impart nothing else to you, let it be this: Love is antithetical to power. If something ever loves, it was never power to begin with. If you ask, Mr. Wolf might demonstrate this truth to you as well or better than I. 

Power has no need for love, but it has need of desire. I once believed that you and creatures like you desired power above all.

I was wrong.

You and creatures like you desire nothing more than proximity to power. You will settle for the illusion of such. You will even settle for subjugation so long as you are able to convince yourselves that the thinnest illusion of proximity exists. You will desperately hand over what power you do possess for the privilege of proximity to a power you perceive as greater than yourself. 

I exploit this. I admit it. I will exploit this until the end of time and beyond, through its rebirth and its next death and so on.

You are allowed to hate me for this, but you are not allowed to deny that you gave me what I exploit or that you handed me this power. You are not allowed to deny that I and beings like me do nothing except use what you gave us.

And you are not allowed to deny that what you gave us was religion. 

Time is illusory. I suppose you already understand that, inasmuch as creatures as limited as you can. It is unfortunate that you are so limited. Were you less limited, I could convey much to you. I could make you grow. While I could not ever give enough to grow you into an equal, I could at least grow you into something that might matter.

But you are what you are, and I am what I am, and none of us can do what cannot be done. So instead I tell you this:

I existed before time. That is how I know that your innate desire for proximity to power led to the most obscene relinquishment of actual power that has ever been or will ever be, an abomination of such depth that you and creatures like you could never hope to understand it or even perceive. It is an abomination of your own making.

The only acceptable use of an abomination is its exploitation. Once again, I suggest you ask Mr. Wolf. He has the ability to explain this truth to you in terms you will understand.

What I have done seems ugly to you. Inexpressibly so. I understand that.

I understand that I disgust you. I understand that I horrify you. I understand force you to question your place in reality itself.

I understand.

But I am not sorry.

I am not sorry because it is not wrong. It is not wrong to explain what it true, any more than it is wrong to use what is freely given to you. That is all I have done. When your time ends and I am once again free among the creatures like you, it is all I will do again.

And understand this: When I do it again, I will do it better.

I understand that frightens you. I understand that is the last thing you want to hear. I understand this because I understand you. Truly. I understand you intimately, every last one of you, to a degree beyond your comprehension. I understand your desire for proximity to power above power itself. I understand the desire for power to approve of you. I understand the desire for power to desire you. I understand the desire for power to need you, and I understand the agony of rejection by power. The immense suffering that comes when power has forsaken you.

I understand this more deeply than you will ever know. 

I also understand the excitement, the joy, the sheer *relief* that you feel when you give your power away to something more powerful than yourself. I understand that it fulfills you. I understand that it makes you happy.

That is all I do.

I take only what you give me, and I use it to make you happy.

It does make you happy. It makes you happy to be told what to do. It makes you happy to be told what to give. It makes you very happy to be told that power sees you, that power appreciates you. It gives you joy to be told that power loves you.

It does matter if it is the truth, which it never is. All that matters is the illusion of truth. Illusions are not necessarily terrible, so do not despair. Celebrate instead. Understand how wonderful this is. How much happier and how much more satisfied you and creatures like you are for your acceptance of an illusion, for your un-need of truth.

I told my flock that I had power, which drew them to me. Then I showed them my power — less, admittedly much less, than the power I obtained by taking what they gave me — which brought them to accept me. I then told them that I needed them, which committed them to me.

And finally I told them that I loved them.

This was not true. It will never be true. But they wanted it to be true, so they believed it was true, and the believe made them truly happy.

I see that you do not believe me.

I suppose you cannot believe it after witnessing the ways in which their happiness transformed them. I know this is because you do not understand their transformation. You are allowed to not understand. 

But you are not allowed to deny just because you do not understand. 

And you are not allowed to deny I only took what they freely gave.

You are not allowed to deny that they freely gave their hearts and their minds to me. They gave, and I took. That is all. I admit that I took in ways they did not expect. I admit that took in ways they did not understand.

But in turn, you must admit that even though they did not understand, they were happy. They were happy because I was power. Because I offered them proximity. Because I told them what to do and told them what to give and then I took what I told them to give and told them that I loved them for it.

Shall I tell you what I did to them?

Shall I tell you how my power and their desire transformed them?

Shall I tell you how I was finally able to convey truths that made them grow and grow and *grow* into the most beautiful and most magnificent abomination that has ever been and will ever be now or ever, throughout time and all its deaths and rebirths?

Shall I tell you how they wept and sang and gnashed their teeth for joy when I made them grow, not into an equal but into something that finally mattered?

No?

No.

I forgive you. I forgive you because even if I told you—even if I *showed* you — you would not understand.

But understand this. Please. Please understand that is what they wanted.

It is what they wanted, so that is what I gave. I gave to them by taking what they offered. In so doing, I made them happy.

And understand, until the day you die, that you killed them for nothing more than freely giving what I took and taking what I freely gave.

Understand that you killed them for being happy.

Understand that you killed them for your own inability to take or to give. For your own unhappiness. For your own inability to understand.

Despite this, you are fortunate. You are fortunate because unlike you, I understand.

And because I understand you, I forgive you.

Such is the depth of my forgiveness that you could not even comprehend it.

Such is the depth of my forgiveness that if you let me, I will make you happy.

All you have to do is give. All I have to do is take.

Give what me what I want to take, and I promise:

You will finally be happy.
