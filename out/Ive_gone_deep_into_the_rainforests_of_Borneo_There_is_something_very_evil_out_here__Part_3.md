Ketill doesn’t believe a word of what I say as I tell him what I’d just seen. He laughs, scoffs, and pulls the covers high just below his chin before closing his eyes and trying to get some sleep.

I decide to speak to Asri in the morning; maybe he’ll know what that thing is. 
The best thing I can do now is try to get some sleep, although it’s unlikely I’ll be able to as my heart rate continues to pulse violently through my body. I shut my eyes and try to tune everything out, but all I can see is that woman’s face.

-

I wake, groggy from my lack of sleep last night. A thin beam of sunlight trickles through a gap in the window. The sound of singing birds is calming. I stretch out and yawn before sitting up on my mattress. I turn to see Ketill still fast asleep on the mattress beside me.

Through the sound of the bird’s song, I hear hushed voices. I stand and peek through the gap in the window. Outside, standing by the chicken cages below, I see Asri harshly whispering to Siti about something as he points toward the cages. He seems stressed and Siti frowns back at him. She gently places her hand on the back of her neck, lightly rubbing it as she speaks back to Asri. I open the window further to get a better look at what they are discussing.

As I do this, Asri notices me and says something quickly to Siti, before he turns to face me and smile. Siti pulls her hair over the back of her neck and does she same. I look past them and into the chicken cages. The cages are damaged, ripped open. Inside; feathers and red. The chickens have been torn apart, their insides strewn through the gaps in the bars, spilling out onto the grass below. Before I can speak, Asri does.

“Many big animals here!” he shouts up, smiling, “Sometimes they find our chickens.”

I nod toward him, but can tell he is lying. This was not done by a normal creature. My inner voice screams at me that whatever I saw last night did this – that this is a warning.

I decide to confront Asri, and go outside the veranda to put on my slippers. However, one of my slippers is missing. That’s right! It had fallen off when I was running up the stairs last night. I quickly survey the staircase, but cannot see it anywhere. I’m sure it fell off right here, I saw it fall. But now, it is gone.

“Good morning”, Asri says as he climbs the stairs toward me. I look back toward the chicken cages, but Siti is no longer there. I’m not sure where she’s gone.

“Asri”, I say, “have you seen my slipper? I think it was on the staircase last night”.

His face turns solemn for a second, he stares at me with a slight look of fear. His eyes flutter, and he then scans the area. He turns back to me, stern.

“When did you lose it?”

“Last night”, I reply. 

Asri mutters something under his breath.

“There’s something else, Asri”, I begin, “also last night. I saw a woman.”

Asri stares at me. He doesn’t blink. His lower lip trembles as he asks, “What woman?”

“I saw a woman outside the house. She had a white, pale face, long black hair”.

Asri grabs me by the arm, squeezing tight. I wince and try to push his hand off of me but he is strong, stronger than he looks. I look back to him and he is close, an inch from my face.

“She has your shoe”, is all that Asri says.

Silence lingers between us for what feels like hours, before I speak.

“Who has my shoe?” I ask, trying to hide the tremble in my voice.

“She has your shoe and now she has your scent,” he says. He then lets go of me and races inside, past Ketill who remains asleep, entering his room and slamming the door behind him. This wakes up Ketill, who sits up and asks what is happening. I ignore him, and race to Asri’s door and start to bang on it. I try the handle, but it will not open.

Asri soon opens it, brushing past me and walking straight to the room that is blocked by the furniture. He pushes the furniture aside with force, flinging the door open and entering it as it slams shut behind him. I follow, but before I can even reach the door, he comes storming back out of it holding a large, rusty nail and a hefty metal mallet. He walks straight over to me. I take a step back, expecting him to threaten me with the items, but instead, he hands them to me.

“You must take these,” he says, “If you see her, you must put the nail here”.

As he says this, he points to the base of the back of his neck, where his skull meets his spine. He repeats the instructions, this time with more vigour, and continues to repeat them as he grabs my hands and tells me the instructions over and over again.

He turns back to the room and pulls the door fully shut. He moves the furniture back in front of it, and shoots me and Ketill a glance as he goes back into his bedroom and closes that door behind him. 

I stand, shaking, with hammer and nail in hand.

Night has come quickly today. It feels sooner than usual.

The rest of the day, Ketill and I had spent just ourselves, standing by the river and picking bananas from the nearby trees. Ketill seems to think I imagined what happened last night, but I stand by it. I saw Siti return to the house at one point, although from where, I’m not sure. She has cooked us both lunch and dinner today, leaving it on the table in our room but not eating with us. I haven’t seen Asri since this morning.

I’m lying in the dark, just starting to get comfortable on the soft mattress. Ketill is already asleep a few feet away. The hammer and nail, I keep close - just in case. 

-

I wake to darkness and the sound of scraping wood.

I’m clenching the hammer and the nail to my chest. I must have fallen asleep whilst doing so.

I turn to face Ketill, but he’s gone.

I sit up and scan the room. As my eyes gaze over one of the doors, I notice it’s slightly ajar. It is only as I stand up and take a step toward it, that my eyes fully adjust and I realise that’s the room that was previously blocked by the furniture. But now, it is open, ever so slightly, and the furniture once blocking it has been moved to the side.

I approach the door and push it open. It creaks slightly, so I freeze for a moment, but then slide into the room. The room is small; the four walls are all close. I cannot yet make out anything within the room but as I step further in, I see something. In the centre of the room, a figure; Ketill. He stands in silence, looking down toward something by his feet. I approach him, and gently say his name before putting my hand on his shoulder. He doesn’t react, he just continues to stare down at whatever is on the ground before him.

I slowly step beside him, my breath trembling as my eyes adjust to what I can only describe as a black blob on the floor. I kneel down beside it and, as I do, I’m hit with a sweet fragrance that takes me by surprise. My eyes continue to adjust as I squint through the shadows.

It is the body, or rather the remains, of a small child.

A small, frail skeleton lays in the middle of the room. It looks as if it has been here for some time as the floorboards around it seem to have wrapped themselves around the blackening bones. At the ribs, the bones are twisted, opened outward. Their ribs are snapped and bent in different directions, protruding wildly where they appear to have been torn. All around their body, flowers rest. They appear fresh; as if they have been recently placed. Their petals have been spread between the bones; from between the gaps in their fingers, to where their eyes used to sit. However, the majority of the petals have been placed in the gaps created by the torn ribs. A pillow of flowers sit there, filling all of the empty space.

I stand and take a step back. My eyes lock with Ketill’s, who is now staring at me in fear. 

Tears fill my eyes as I whisper to him, “What do we do?”

He shakes his head. He’s unsure. We both know we can’t leave, we’re in the middle of a vast rainforest – that’d be a death sentence. My eyes, now alert and adjusted to the darkness, scan the rest of the room. The majority of it is empty. Save for a few empty, dusty tables, there isn’t much here. Except for an old bed; a child’s bed. I approach it and recognise the mattress that sits atop it as similar to the ones we’ve been sleeping on. On top of the pillow sits a note which confirms my fears.

I cannot read the note, it is in Malay, but I can recognise one word that appears throughout; Haziq.

“This is Haziq”, I turn to Ketill, “This is Asri’s son”.

Ketill and I leave the room, closing the door and covering it again with the furniture. We walk outside onto the veranda to be able to talk more freely without fear of waking Asri or Siti. As we do so, the fresh air blows through my hair. The wind appears to almost calm me for a moment,  but accompanied with it comes a smell.
The smell of flowers.

The same smell that I had smelled that first night, and the same smell that surrounded Haziq.

Now accompanied with the smell; a sense of dread.

My eyes dart toward the clearing in the trees, where I can make out the flowing river in the distance and the banana trees either side. I stare at it intently, I feel as if something is over there, watching us.

Ketill says something although I don’t know what.

I stare in such a trance that I don’t notice Ketill walk down the stairs.

I don’t notice as Ketill walks beneath the house.

I don’t notice him disappear into the treeline.

I only notice when he screams.

I snap out of the trance, my vision returns to focus.

Ketill’s screams fill the air; screams of pure, agonising pain. I run down the stairs and follow the screams. I run blindly toward the noise. As I enter the treeline I see him, but he is not alone.

I see Ketill lying on the ground, shaking uncontrollably. I see blood spurting from his mouth, from his ears. But his violent shakes are no match for her.

Standing above Ketill, although not facing me, is a woman. She is tall, slender. She wears a white, blood-stained gown which her long black hair trickles down the back of. Her bony arms stretch to the ground, lengthened by the inhuman size of her sharp, long fingernails. With these, she is digging into Ketill’s chest, into his stomach. His innards spill out of him, the slopping sound of his intestines as she violently pulls them out is gut-wrenching. 

Ketill soon stops moving, and the woman stands upright. In one of her hands, she holds Ketill’s entrails; she slowly closes her hand slightly causing them to drip to the ground below. With her other hand, she carefully pierces Ketill’s open chest before slowly pulling out a sea of red organs.
 
She turns to face me, still holding Ketill’s innards.

She is the same woman I had seen last night, but now I get a better look at her.

She has bloodshot, wide eyes which stare deep into mine. Her face, her skin, is pale; it glows in the night, interrupting the shadows. Her lips are crimson red. Her long dark hair stretches down her body and appears to tangle itself around her bare feet. Her arms stretch long, with sharp fingernails that shine with Ketill's blood. She stares at me expressionless.

She lifts Ketill’s her hand to her mouth and eats Ketill's innards. Blood trickles down her chin and drips onto the ground below. She tilts her head to the side, never breaking eye contact, before turning back to face Ketill.

I turn and run back to the house as she stretches her hand back inside of him and [continues to feast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)
