Okay, I think this needs a bit more context. You wouldn’t know it if you saw me walk down the street, but my family owns a village. This village is somewhere in Bengal, but I won’t tell you where for reasons that will quickly become clear. My ancestors were given the *zamindari*, or feudal rights, over the settlement by the Pala kings all the way back in the 11^(th) century. Yes, it’s been a heck of a long time. What did we do to deserve this honour, you ask?

 

Well, there isn’t a simple answer to that. Kings used to give away lands and villages for practically anything back in the day, from marrying the princess to curing the prince of an illness to bringing over the neighbouring king’s head. I haven’t had the time or the inclination to rifle through what little family chronicles have survived to find out which one we did. I live miles away from that place anyway, in Kolkata. My father left the ancestral manor in the care of my grandfather and his brothers and moved away with his family when I was barely learning to open my eyes. Since then, I have only visited Chhayagarh a total of five times. That’s the name of the village, by the way. Chhayagarh.

 

The last time I visited the village, I was ten years old. My father was still alive then. My memories are dim, given that it was more than a decade ago, but I remember the important details. I remember my grandfather’s glowing face as he sunned himself in his recliner, watching me play with the weeds in the courtyard. I remember his hefty walking stick, and enjoying the loud clacks it made as he walked around the corridors. I remember Ram Lal, the manservant, chasing me around the backyard to force me into taking a bath. I remember my grandmother’s delicious cooking on my tongue.

 

I remember other things too. The pale lady in a white *sari*, smiling at me from the parapet of the boundary wall. The unnaturally tall man whispering to my grandfather in his study, his broad-brimmed hat scraping the ceiling. He had turned briefly to smile at me; his face had nothing on it save the grinning mouth. I remember the shaggy thing I used to play fetch with near the family grove, built like a dog but not quite. I remember my father sending me back to my room with a harsh noise, old rifle in hand, before joining a small group of villagers with flaming torches and wooden staves at the front gate at midnight.

 

There is something off about Chhayagarh. I can’t find a better way to explain it. It is a normal village, with all the trappings you would expect: playing children, women with water pots, charming little trees and huts. But alongside that world, there is another world that lives there. A world many of us would rather not acknowledge. That world was somehow centred around us. Each time my father took us there, something was always happening: villagers filtering in and out to confer with the family, mounds of dusty books and manuscripts lying open on tables, weapons being brought out and maintained. Each of these buildups would inevitably have a climax: a loud struggle at midnight, gunshots in the forest, a massive ritual bonfire in the atrium, or something similar. I never saw these climaxes; everyone made sure to give me a wide berth whenever funny business was involved. After everything was over, my father would pack us up, and we would be back in Kolkata, none the worse for the wear.

 

The last time we went there, it was different. I was too young to ask questions, but something went wrong. That night, my father returned three hours later, his face white as a sheet. He was alone and without his gun. He said nothing, he did nothing. He merely went into a room with my mother and my grandfather, and closed the door. Fifteen minutes later, my mother came to put me to bed as usual. I am pretty sure she said nothing out of the ordinary, but there were streaks of tears running down her face. The next morning, we packed our bags and returned to Kolkata.

 

Two days later, there was an accident. Thirty cars piled up on the road. Only one casualty. Even at the cremation, my mother said nothing. She only cried silently as she handed me the torch and let me burn my father’s mangled corpse to ashes. We haven’t been back to Chhayagarh since. In fact, she has actively kept me away from visiting, despite more than a hundred letters from my grandparents (old-fashioned people; apparently, they never could figure the telephone out).

 

Not that I’m complaining. Without the rose-tinted glasses of childhood, it was kind of a shitty place anyway. The land was dry and hard, and the villagers struggled to farm in the best of weather. The water table was deep and stony, and the nearest well was over two miles from the manor; the servants had the near-constant duty of running pots of water to the house for cooking and cleaning. I’m pretty sure there still isn’t a mobile tower, bank, or post office in the entire block. In hindsight, the only thing that made it worth it was the pure joy on my grandfather’s face whenever he saw us. But that can only take you so far.

 

My life in Kolkata is good. I just finished my law degree, and a career in litigation looks to be on track, though my senior still insists that five thousand rupees is plenty of money to live on for a month. I’m not sure he has purchased anything since the fifties. My mother is running a successful interior decoration business, so that helps with the finances. My father also left behind a decent estate, and for all our neglect, my grandparents do not skimp on sending over the revenue from the property. I dimly knew that I was going to come into the *zamindari* eventually, given that my father was no longer in the picture, but it was not something I really thought about. In any case, I was planning to pawn the damn place off to the first feudal enthusiast I met with more money than sense. Chhayagarh did not feature in my top fifty priorities list.

 

Until yesterday. This time, the letter that came did not bear my grandfather’s characteristically elegant handwriting on the envelope. It was the harsh, angular script of a lawyer, just in case the starched brown envelope did not make the official nature of the communication clear enough. Apparently, our family has an estate manager.

 

He was writing to tell me that my grandfather was dead. There were no details as to how, just strict business: in accordance with ordinary rules of succession, the *zamindari* should devolve to one of my uncles, but my grandfather had made his wishes clear. The family customs had to be followed. The land and the village must pass to his firstborn son, my father, and through him to his firstborn son. Me.

 

He had also insisted that I come to the village immediately, and take charge of the manor and the surrounding properties. The estate lawyer would meet me there and hand over some articles he had bequeathed to me. I had sole and absolute ownership over the ancestral house, but he had requested that I allow my grandmother, my uncles, and their families to continue their residence on the premises and take care of their needs.

 

When I showed my mother the letter, I was expecting she would say what was already on my mind: toss the letter in the bin, surrender the property to some relative or, failing that, the government, and go on with my life in peace.

 

Instead, she sighed, put the letter face down on the table, and asked, “When are you leaving?”

 

“What?” was all I could say.

 

“Chhayagarh. When are you going over to take possession?”

 

“Mom. Are you serious? That place is a dump. I have no interest in roleplaying a medieval landlord in some godforsaken hamlet in the middle of nowhere. I have a career here. We have a business here!”

 

She sighed. “I wish I could have kept you here forever, but I can’t. You have to go. Our family must take up the mantle. It is our duty to Chhayagarh, to our ancestors, to ourselves. Go.”

 

I paused. “That place killed my father. I’m not going. I’m going to write to the lawyer, and—”

 

“Chhayagarh killed your father. And it killed your grandfather.”

 

“Grandfather? How can you be so sure?”

 

“It killed him, just as it has killed many of your ancestors before him. I know it, somewhere inside me. Just as your father knew, that day. He knew he was going to die. He could not keep winning. But he did his duty. Just as you will. Because if you don’t, Chhayagarh will kill many more.”

 

I leaned forward and grasper her hands in my own. “Mom… You’re not telling me something. What do you know?”

 

“Not enough. Only they can explain it to you. Those who have lived on the land, and worked with it. But I know this. There was a reason your family, our family, was given that land. No, a reason they were placed upon that land. It wasn’t wealth, or favour, or martial skill that won us Chhayagarh. It was something else. Something to do with… them. The others. You know of what I speak.” Her hands trembled in mine. “You must go.”

 

She would say no more after this, only insisting that I go, and that all will be clear once I reach the manor and take over affairs. I will be frank. After this conversation, my desire to go to Chhayagarh had only lessened. But right now, I am in a rattling bus, travelling through territory that I’m pretty sure does not exist on any map you have access to, on a road you will probably never see. A road that leads to Chhayagarh. I am here because of what happened last night.

 

We were finalizing some pleadings for filing, so I left my chamber well after midnight. No, there was no overtime pay. The journey home was a blur, as was changing, brushing my teeth, and collapsing on the bed. My mother was already sleeping like the dead; she had long learned that staying up waiting for me was too regular of an occurrence to be healthy.

 

The first thing I remember is waking up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat. Now, Kolkata does get hot, but not moisten-the-bed-with-sweat hot. I sleepily grabbed my phone off the bedside table and checked the time. Two a.m. With an internal groan, I started drifting off again, but then I noticed that the crack at the bottom of my bedroom door was awash with light. That was strange. My mother never turned on the lights, even if she woke up in the middle of the night. To add to that, this light was a soft and diffuse yellow, nothing like the harsh white glare of the hallway LEDs. Hesitantly, I swung my legs off the bed, feeling for my slippers even as I dragged the shirt over my head. Then, I softly padded over to the door and opened it.

 

There was no longer a hallway on the other side. Instead, a dozen candles illuminated a cosy little room with bookshelves wrapping around the walls. Small wooden tables held more piles of books and papers, and a larger one had a topographical map spread out, multi-coloured pins poking out here and there. A few roughly bound manuscripts and diagrams were also strewn haphazardly across the floor. In the farthest corner, there was a little writing table, decorated with ornate sigils and floral designs.

 

Somehow, my bedroom had opened onto my grandfather’s study. The man himself was hunched over the writing table, scribbling absent-mindedly on parchment with a gilded pen.  At this point, I was sure I was dreaming. Nevertheless, I tried to be quiet as I walked over to him, carefully stepping around the papers on the floor. Despite his age, his burly frame filled the chair, muscles bulging through the thin tunic he wore: though he had lost tone with age, a lifetime of hard work had made him an incredibly strong man. His walking stick leaned against one of the armrests, the knotted head glinting slightly in the firelight. A rimless pair of spectacles perched at the very tip of his nose as he peered down at his writings, occasionally stopping to consult one of the many open books on the table. I slowly reached out and touched his arm. It felt solid and fleshy. Real. But he did not react at all, continuing his work. Definitely a dream, then.

 

“*Babu*?”

 

The voice came from the door I had just come through. I turned to see a gaunt, fit man standing in the doorway, hands clasped at his waist. His dark hair was cropped short, and he sported a thin, well-groomed moustache. He was bare-chested and wore a faded white *dhoti*, with a coarse cotton *gamcha* around his neck. I did not know this man, but I would know the attire anywhere. It was the attire of a traditional village manservant.

 

My grandfather turned in his chair. “Yes, Bhanu?”

 

The servant’s eyes darted from side to side, unsure. “It… He is here, *babu*. Should I show him in? He has never come this late in the night.”

 

“The tall one?”

 

“Yes. Should I send him away like last time? He is being insistent.”

 

“No, Bhanu. I was the one who invited him. Show him in.”

 

“Yes, *babu*.” Bhanu nervously twisted his *gamcha* before walking out.

 

A few seconds later, a figure came through the door, bowing his head and shoulders to fit. It was clad in a long cloak that fell down from its shoulders to its feet, covering its form entirely. A broad hat covered its head, the shadow hiding its face from view as well. It slowly stalked over, keeping its head bowed to avoid touching the whitewashed ceiling, until it stood right behind my grandfather. He kept his back turned to the entity, lazily continuing his scribbling.

 

“*Thakur*.”

 

My grandfather gave no response.

 

“*Thakur*.” The entity’s voice was thick and heavy, but still intelligible.

 

“I agreed to see you because you were so persistent, my friend, but it is not like you to waste time looking for my attention.” My grandfather paused to look at one of the books. “Speak.”

 

“*Thakur*, do not go today. The omens are not right. The trees are restless. The birds sing of doom. Do not go.”

 

“If you came to stop me, you have come in vain. It must be tonight. You know that.”

 

“The forest is not safe tonight. Even with your weapons, your men, and your rituals, success is barely possible. And you choose to go alone.”

 

“I cannot risk the others for this. This is my duty to the land. My burden to bear.” To punctuate his point, my grandfather stabbed his pen into the paper, leaving a large dot in the middle of the design he was drawing.

 

“*Thakur*, you are brave. Like your father was brave. Like his father was brave. But you are also wise. Listen to me. There will be other times. Other nights. Tonight, you will die.”

 

“If that is what it takes.”

 

The entity rumbled, its cloak ripping as a long, whitish hand appeared. It opened its clenched fist over the table, depositing some small pebble-like things in front of my grandfather. I leaned over to see.

 

They were human teeth, flecked with dried blood and bits of gum. I recoiled, my stomach lurching. This dream was steadily turning into something of a nightmare.

 

“It has begun its hunt. Its power waxes with the rising of the moon. If you go, you will die. And you will fail. Go tomorrow.”

 

“And you will say the same thing tomorrow.” Grandfather brushed the teeth into one little pile to the side, unfazed.

 

“If so, you will try the day after tomorrow. Or the day after that.”

 

“No!” For the first time, he raised his voice. “It cannot be tomorrow. If I don’t go today, it will attack. It is ready. You know that. The village. My family. Nothing will be safe.”

 

The entity was silent for a few seconds. “Yes. It is ready. That is true.”

 

“If I win, that is another curse off the land for a few centuries. If I lose…” He opened one of the drawers on the table, producing a small glass phial. “I can slow it down, at least. Buy some time.”

 

“For whom? Him?”

 

“I have faith in my grandson. If anyone can figure out a way, he will. He is the next lord, after all. After my son…” He paused again. “I cannot lose again. But if I do… Help him.”

 

“I have seen the boy, *Thakur*. He knows nothing of our ways. And he does not have time to learn. If you fail…”

 

“Have faith, old friend. We must have faith. In these times, we have little else.” Grandfather sighed, resuming his drawing again. “If there is nothing else…”

 

The entity made a deep noise that reverberated in my chest. A sigh. Then it removed its hat, revealing a smooth, white head devoid of hair or ears. It had no marks or blemishes. Just a smooth, bulbous mass, at least from the back. As I looked at his bare skin, my limbs grew heavy. My head erupted in a dull migraine, and my knees knocked, threatening to buckle. A primal chill settled in the pit of my stomach.

 

“As you wish, *Thakur*. I will pray I see you again. If not… I will honour my promise. The young lord will be safe with me.”

 

My grandfather chuckled, despite the heavy sense of dread that was beginning to permeate the air. “Pray? You?”

 

“We have gods of our own, though you would not term them as such.” The entity chuckled, its skin rippling like water. “Good luck.”

 

It put its hat on again and slowly backed out of the room, without turning its back. Even after it was out of view, the cold terror remained. With a jolt, I realized I was sweating again. Was this normal for dreams? Or was this a nightmare? Did it matter?

 

Either way, it was time to go. I slowly backed away, out of the doorway and back to my bedroom.

 

But my bedroom was no longer there. Instead, I was in our ancestral manor, the hallways dark and cold. The village did have electricity, but power was unreliable at best. That was probably why the study was lit by candles. But outside, the servants had neglected to light the many oil lamps hanging on hooks around the house.

 

I still wanted to believe this was a dream. But the familiar chill of the midnight air, the distant smells of the land, the feel of the hard marble against my feet, and much more made that incredibly difficult to believe. My doubts were fully and finally erased when an ice-cold hand grabbed my wrist from behind.

 

“You are far from your proper time, little lord.”

 

The hand slowly but firmly turned me around. The cloaked entity towered over me. This close, the radiating sense of dread was almost overpowering, settling into my veins like frost and chilling my blood. My heart pounded like a rabid dog, but otherwise, time refused to flow. A prickling sensation began to grow out of its grip, turning the skin dead and numb as it grew. I dared not look down at its hand, my eyes stuck on the hat covering its face.

 

“You ought to be more careful. Not everyone will be as charitable as I when dealing with trespass of this magnitude.”

 

With its other hand, it removed its hat. Like the back of its head, its face was completely featureless. Except for a mouth. A wide, grinning mouth, showing off straight white teeth.

 

“But then again, you are not here by choice, are you? You are incapable of that. For now.”

 

Its mouth did not move when it spoke, the voice merely echoing in my ears. I could not even shake in fear. My muscles refused to obey me. My legs started to crumple, but his immovable grip somehow held me upright, like a puppet propped up by strings.

 

“Either way, you must go back. Mortals cannot be stuck in time. Very harmful, even for one from your bloodline.” It bent down, leaning its head forward until he was close enough to kiss. “Would you like to go back now, little lord?”

 

My teeth were clenched so hard I was afraid they might break, but even through the haze of fear, I managed to give him a jerky nod. This close, its skin gave off the smell of rotting flesh and sickly decay. Its grin widened even further at my assent. Impossibly further, stretching around the sides of his head and around to the back until his mouth formed a continuous band around his head.

 

“See you soon… *Thakur*.”

 

His head split open like a box, the top tilting back to reveal a pitch-black maw. He continued to lean, beginning to swallow me from top to bottom. My heart was trying to break through my ribcage and flee, but I was otherwise paralyzed, only watching helplessly as the darkness swallowed my vision, and then my hearing. Then my sense of smell went, and then finally all sensation disappeared as he let go of my wrist. I could only feel one thing: the dim pressure of his hands around my waist as he tilted his head back again, pushing me into his gullet. His mouth was warm and heavy, more like a weighted blanket than a body cavity.

 

But as the top of his head sealed around my legs, all sensation returned. Just in time for the void to begin pressing in on me in undulating waves, growing needle-like teeth that stabbed and tore at my flesh. As the creature chewed, I began to scream. Then the maw closed in, crushing my bones like twigs with one final squeeze.

 

When I woke up in my bed, the light of early morning shining outside, I was still screaming. But I was intact and mercifully unchewed. In fact, I could have passed off the whole thing as a bad dream, even when my mother burst into my room and demanded to know why I was screaming loud enough for them to hear me in Delhi.

 

Instead, I packed two light suitcases, made excuses with my chamber, bid my mother goodbye, caught a cab to a bus terminus, and bought a ticket for Chhayagarh. Because, though no other mark from last night remains, it is very difficult to ignore the raw, red skin around my wrist. Especially when it is in the shape of an abnormally large hand.

 

The bus I am on right now is an overnight route. The vehicle is almost empty, with only five passengers beside me. They all seem to be non-locals. Backpackers, probably. One of them appears to be European, while the others are Indian like me. The driver pays them no mind, but for some reason, he keeps looking at me in the rearview mirror. He says nothing, does nothing, and does not stare for too long. But I could have sworn that, at least once or twice, when I met his gaze, his eyes were dark voids, interspersed with glittering stars. Then again, getting eaten does tend to make you a little tired, so who knows what I’m seeing?

 

I wanted to be a reasonably successful litigator. Instead, I’m now on my way to claim a *zamindari* that’s about ten centuries old. I’m about to be the lord of my own little village. A village that has apparently claimed the lives of both my father and my grandfather, in the same line of work that I am expected to pursue once I get there. On top of that, there is something there that may have taken a liking to my taste and may decide to try me out in real life this time, promise or no promise.

 

I’ll keep you guys posted. Welcome to Chhayagarh.
