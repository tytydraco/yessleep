I’m writing this from the sperm white walled prison cell I will finish the rest of my days in. I have conceived the desire to give expression to the gruesome events that have transpired. Hopefully the careful arrangement of my words will exceed in exciting your imagination in such a way that we become accomplices in the crime I have committed, and the burden of this sorrow and grief I feel so acutely can be shared.

  
  
This story takes place when I was a younger and more ambitious man, I was less speckled with gray and my wrinkles didn’t resemble the skin of a scrotum back then. I was working at a big law firm in the city, this, paired with my handsome youthful complexion, made me think I was the wolf of Wall Street. I shared rent on a sweet high rise condo with a man named Oliver Jenkins. Now, he didn’t flaunt his gayness, but he was far swishier than the average man and this was still a bit before the gay pride wave had taken off to what it is today, gay marriage wasn’t even legal yet and people weren’t flashing their glam like the colors of a Willy Wonka treasure trove, in fact a silent majority of people were pretty anti gay. I’m sad to say this in hindsight now, but I would flaunt having him as my roommate as evidence of my progressive ideals. I made it yet another way I could virtue signal and maintain my “holier than thou” narcissistic attitude.  
  
  
  
As I got to know Oliver I realized that aside from his toned muscles, fire truck red hair and the way he pushed his sexuality on you. He was sincere, trustworthy and honest. The kind of person whose kindhearted moral qualities you could never look down on. I ended up owing him a huge favor too, because if it were not for him I would never have met the most beautiful blonde girl, with brilliant eyes, a cute pointy nose and a devilishly charming grin. The love of my life, Julie Harmon.

  
  
Oliver had invited me to his spin class... Yes, spin class. To introduce me to his beloved friend Julie, to whom he was much devoted. I recalled a different girl Oliver was friends with who was so fat that I wouldn’t be surprised if she put mayonnaise on her aspirin, so I was skeptical of the whole thing. But reluctantly I agreed to go.

  
  
I fell in love with Julie that day, I still remember the first sarcastic comment she made to me, “oh this is who you wanted me to meet?” She said to Oliver, “he’s not good enough for me”. She was always a riot to be around and would make these funny sweeping generalizations like, “intellectual always women dress funny”, and “peach ice cream is never as good as you think it’s gonna be”. Her beauty and grace were one of a kind and I fell into a trance under her spell. Yet as much as I cared for this girl nobody loved or respected her more than her dear friend Oliver.

  
  
In those days I was incredibly busy with my career, all my time was spent at the office. As a young man with a prominent love interest I resented this to no end. We were still in our honeymoon phase, and too out of our senses to realize calling each other cutie fudge pie, tender mittens, and rose lips was weird, yet the world was ours and we simply didn’t care. Oliver played an important and useful role in all of this for me. He and Julie were coworkers and spent all of their time together and obviously (yet unfortunately for me) a girl of Julie’s quality had many suitors. Oliver would act in a way to ease my mind on such matters. He was devoted to my relationship with Julie and he would tell me stories of men hitting on Julie and how he told them off. He would say, “you know Julie and I were at the gym today and G.I. Joe Chad came up to her to flirt and ask for her number, I pretended to be her boyfriend, and he was flabbergasted and stormed off”.

  
  
He told me tons of these little stories, so frequently that I could tell there were a fair bit of white lies. If I called him out on his bullshit he would laugh so hard you couldn’t help but join in. I was a young fool and I forgave him everything, never realizing how important his friendship was to me, and to my relationship with Julie.

  
  
Then the car accident happened. A drunk driving collision. Unfortunately I wasn’t the drunk driver (nothing is scarier than crashing sober they say). A drunken man had swerved into me in his red Kia for a head on collision. I was hospitalized for weeks and barely conscious for a significant part of that time. Feverish dreams came to me of an angel standing over me nursing me to health. The doctors would later tell me the angel was Oliver. He never left my side, and he would anticipate and attend my every desire. As I started to regain my health I would have to beg him to leave me alone as he would pretend that I needed his service. He would tend to needs I didn’t even have and I felt guilty about how much he cared about me, and oh what the heck, I loved this gay man, and this gay man for no reason whatsoever loved the shit out of me. If I cried, rest assured Oliver would be there crying with me.

  
  
Months passed before an event so terrible tested this friendship to such a degree that it could never be rectified.

  
  
It was the start of the Christmas holidays and I would be getting a much needed whole week off work. I was in such good spirits that I skipped and hopped home from my last shift elatedly, unaware of the horror I was about to find. When the elevator to my floor swung open I immediately sensed something was off. My front door was wide open, the neighbors and police men were standing in a crowd around the entryway. Neon yellow caution tape was being carefully strung up, and something in the sunken and horrified expressions of the people’s faces triggered alarm bells in my brain. I sprinted onto the scene and what I saw made me sick to my stomach. My sweetheart was lying in a pool of blood, her dress tattered to shreds, she had been beaten to a pulp and her face and neck were purple. I struggled not to vomit then and there. I ran to her side as if to resuscitate her but I knew it was no use, I knew I was far too late. Everyone there was stunned, and one question lingered in the air quietly being passed around the room. “Who did this?” The silence of the room broke and the crowd became like a swarm of bees whose nest had been smashed. A neighbor spoke out of the crowd “I saw Oliver running out of this place earlier”. The security tapes were checked and confirmed he exited earlier around the time the violent murder and rape may have happened. The prejudiced people were spewing homophobic slurs this being everything they needed to confirm their erroneous prejudices. For a moment I was swept up into it all, the order was given and police were sent out on a mission to track Oliver down.

  
  
During all this commotion Julie’s parents had arrived at the scene of the crime, her mother was a wet mess of hysteria, snot and tears. Her father however didn’t say a word and had an expression as cold as ice on his face. Now I knew something about Oliver I hadn’t relayed to the cops, that he had a secret lover a few towns away and I had a hunch he would be there. There was a ferocity brewing inside me similar to that of Julie’s vengeful father and it didn’t take much to get him to come with me. We set off in his car the cold steel of his loaded Glock resting peacefully on his lap. The frenzy of his wrath was visually apparent, and was justified, no father should ever have to see his precious daughter beaten to a bloody pile beyond recognition. A dangerous premonition was being pumped through the vents of the car on that fateful day.

  
  
I can’t explain how I was feeling as we drove along in search of that demon. I was having an out of body experience, I was empathizing with the beasts of the animal kingdom. I would be satisfied with nothing less than blood.

  
  
The apartment complex we were headed to was home to a large parking lot with a forest beside it, and as we pulled in we happened to see Oliver sneaking to his car. When I laid my eyes upon him I remember thinking that this fa\*got stood for all that I detested in this world. I swerved into a spot, and leaped out of the car, running across the lot towards him with clenched fists and jaw. “Fancy seeing you here” he called out in a shocked expression. “Fancy?” I barked, “I’m going to see you killed!” His confusion caused him to stumble back a step, confirming his guilt to me. I descended upon him and before he could lift his arms delivered a violent blow to his face. Blood poured out of his nose. “Why?” He shrieked in the saddest voice I have ever heard. He was sobbing uncontrollably and whimpering in self defense, “I’ve only been to see my lover what have I done?” “You're a goddamn liar” I cried out. At this point Julie’s father had reached us and without hesitating delivered a blow of his own with his boot that rendered Oliver unconscious.

  
  
We dragged his limp body from that lot into the woods and tied him to the base of a tall white birch tree with a length of paracord and duct tape from the car. We worked in a silent haste, retribution was the only thing on our minds.

  
  
When I splashed cold water on Oliver he came sputtering to life, slowly like an old Dell computer, his eyes swollen, filled with pus and blood. I showed him a picture on my phone of Julie, making him look at the mess she had become. He screamed when he saw it his face turning pale. We felt he was guilty and condemned him to the worst punishment possible, barely paying any attention to his desperate screams of, “oh my god! My dearest friend Julie what has happened”. “Please you don’t think... you think I did this?” Every syllable was enunciated with desperation. “Please believe me, I trust you!” He was sobbing and crying. Julie’s father was holding a gun in his quivering hand. I looked away tears forming in my eyes, “kill him” I said. A gunshot rang out through the forest.

  
  
It wasn’t until the next morning that the autopsy discovered what chilled my spine to its marrow. The skin under Julie’s nails was that of a black man, Oliver was no black man.

  
  
That poor sad desperate face is what haunts me to this day. I fear when I will confront it again in the afterlife. Ever since then my life has been painted with the emotion of guilt. The guilt was too much for Julie’s father, he killed himself that night, I fear I may soon take my own life as well.

  
  
And that Reddit, is why I will never pass judgment on anyone again.
