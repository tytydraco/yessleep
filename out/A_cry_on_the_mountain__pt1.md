The following recollections may seem like a disjointed series of memories, but I assure you that they will make sense to you in the end, just as they make sense to me almost two decades after moving away from where I grew up. That said, I will try to keep the ramblings to a minimum and the details as organized as possible to still portray the events as accurately as I can remember.


â€¢ In the woods

I grew up in a quiet town on the lower end of the Appalachian mountains as part of a small, reserved christian family. My parents, two sisters (Mary and Hope), and my brother (Paul) to be exact.

We weren't wealthy by any means, as many meals consisted of some mix of: canned vegetables, cornbread, dried beans cooked over a day with some ham, or ramen noodles. 

Growing up, I always heard that the town "thrives on tourism", but in spite of the large number of cars that passed through each year for holidays or when the leaves changed colors, there never seemed to be any tourists that stayed longer than it took to get gas or stop at one of the local stores. Even after moving away, most people I ask about the town don't know if it, despite most of them having traveled straight through it when driving along the road it sits on. 

The house we lived in sat, and still sits, nicely on nearly 30 acres of land enveloped by a plethora of hills, mountains, woods, and fields for children to explore. Which myself and my siblings often found ourselves doing.

Despite the abundance of wildlife in the area that could be hazardous, I can't recall having any issues as a child, outside of a few sightings and sounds. A black bear here, a boar there, and occasional coyotes calling excitedly into the night. The inherent dangers of the mountains and their woods were lessened by the presence of the family's three dogs, who served as avid protectors for the children and property alike.

I never felt scared of the woods, sure I frequently got turned around and a little lost as a child, but I never felt like anything in the woods made me afraid. It might of been the naivety of a child and overconfidence in my knowledge of the area, but the forest always held a certain peace for me, a longing of sorts. Though there was one exception. 

When I was about 11 or 12, I woke up in the pitch black early morning hours to a shrill cry from a mountain in the distance. I assumed it to be an animal in distress at first, but as the sleep cleared from my mind and I heard it more clearly, it sounded just like a woman screaming in terror and pain.

The screams continued for just a few moments, then fell silent. Only to continue periodically throughout the night. Needless to say, I did not get much sleep.

I would have asked my father about it in the morning before he went to work, as he and his mother both lived in the area all their lives, but I tried to avoid him as much as possible. After he left, I waited for my mother to wake up and confronted her after she had breakfast. 

"Did you hear that noise last night?"

She responded with a confused look and said, "what noise?"

I suddenly felt embarrassed, as a child would when they most likely had a dream and thought it was real or when mistaking something normal for something not.

"There was a woman in the woods, it sounded like she was screaming," I managed to mutter out.

My mother, almost dismissively, replied, "oh, that's just a mountain lion."

The statement itself was so short and blunt that I had no inkling to question it further. A mountain lion, makes perfect sense. I had never seen or heard one before, so that must be what one sounds like. Truth be told, that is what a mountain lion sounds like; I looked it up years later when something a coworker said reminded me of the event.

I had no reason to think on it any further, and I heard the scream a few more times over the following years, but looking back, I swear it sounded different sometimes.
