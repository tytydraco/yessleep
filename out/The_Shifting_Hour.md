The shifting hour is an inter-dimensional, paranormal phenomenon, that sometimes occurs for approximately an hour between the hours of 12 pm and 3 am, outside of buildings, when the surrounding area overlaps with another, conscious, dimension for one square mile. This phenomenon is known as “shifting” by those who have experienced it. It does not occur inside buildings and it is unknown why. One theory for why buildings do not shift into this phenomenon is that the glass windows of the buildings somehow ward off the other dimension. This is believed because buildings with broken or empty windows have been reported to have become part of shifts before, whereas buildings with windows have not. 





A very important thing to note about this phenomenon is that, despite what many people may report, it does not occur more frequently in liminal spaces than in other spaces. It is just simply more likely to be noticed in said spaces due to people being more anxious in general within a liminal space, and therefore being more aware than usual of their surroundings.



Signs that you may be in a building that is surrounded by the area of this phenomenon, during the hours when it may occur, are as follows:



1. Strange noises with no visible source. Many survivors have reported hearing noises, from strange tapping on their windows to what sounds like a slightly “off” version of the ice cream truck passing close by. The common factor in all cases is that, when the survivors looked outside for the source of said noises, they would never see anything that could make those sounds.



1. A complete lack of any pedestrians. Cars and their drivers will behave as normal, likely due to the cars possessing windows, but no humans have ever been seen walking outside while the phenomenon is occurring. 



1. Feeling a very strong urge to go outside. This is a less common sign than the other two, but is far more important to be aware of. There is a 10-30%  chance that a person surrounded by the phenomenon will experience this, 10% if they are aware that they are surrounded by the shift. However, if you feel this urge, it is extremely crucial that you do not give into it. Feeling this urge signifies that the other dimension is aware of your conscious, and is doing everything in its power to lure you outside so it may consume you.



This phenomenon does not affect those who are asleep or unconscious. As such, the  best way to stay safe during the phenomenon is to try and sleep, as then it is impossible for the individual to be lured outside.



Those who leave the safety of their building of residence will be consumed by the dimension within 30 seconds of leaving the building. There is no hope for people who have left the buildings, and no one should attempt to help them, unless they wish to die the same painful death as those who were lured out. The consumption to those still inside their building looks as though the victim has simply vanished, but that is most likely not the case, as victims have been seen looking at the ground in terror before disappearing. A notable example of this is a deaf victim’s family member’s recount of the victim walking outside, stopping and staring at the ground before signing:

“DO NOT COME OUTSIDE THE GROUND IS EATING ME,” and then vanishing. This is the only description we have of the consumption process, as once outside no sounds that are made by the victim can be heard by anyone inside the buildings, due to the inside of the building being in a separate dimension from the phenomenon.





The places and dates that the shift happens in are truly random. If you are outside and believe that you are in an area where the shift is taking place, head towards the nearest building with windows as quickly as you can. If there are none near you, pray that you are near the edge of the area and run.
