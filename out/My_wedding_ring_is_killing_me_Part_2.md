It's really late here, really really late. As my mind became more and more tired, I became more and more confused about the day and what I'm doing.

The only explanation I have is that the ring has more power and control when I'm well rested and the more tired and out of my mind I get, the more clarity I have about the situation I'm in.

A lot happened tonight, dear reader. First, I tried to remove the ring again, as everyone suggested. The ring has shrunken in size though, I can feel the engraved writing burning into my finger and with each tug of the ring, it feels like it is getting tighter and tighter. I tried all the same tricks as last time but the ring seems to be aware of my intent and doesn't want to give back what it considers it's *property*.

I considered my options. I could cut off my finger, which feels extreme. I could use the tips I received as replies, I could give up and do what the ring wants and an idea suddenly occurred to me, what if I asked the ring what else it wanted and how I could be set free.

Dear reader, I know talking to a magic ring to find a bargain seems a bit insane, but I was open to anything that would get me out of this situation.

I sat on my couch, and lit a candle (which felt appropriate). I closed my curtains and shut off all the lights. I grabbed a sketch pad and pen and sat. I opened my sketch pad to a blank page and wrote a simple question "What do you want?"

I moved the pen to my left hand and sat there. Nothing happened for a while and I started to believe that maybe this had all been my imagination even though I knew too much had happened for this to be something I dreamt up in my minds eye.

I sat and sat some more. The wicker of the candle moved slightly, keeping rhythm with the imperceptible movement of air that we find in any of our homes. The light flickered and went out.

The darkness consumed the room and I felt my ring finger moving, grasping for the pen. I felt my finger crook over the pen and it started to write something out, completely obscured by the blanket of twilight that engulfed the room. I sat there and waited as the writing went on and on. Then it stopped.

I waited in the silence, a bit in shock and a bit in fear of what I would find on the page. I felt for the lighter and lit the candle again. I closed my eyes for a moment and then I took a breath and looked at the page. 

My heart leapt in my throat. The page had the same thing written over and over again, written as a child writes, scrawls and scribbles. 

It said "Die or find another. Die or find another. Die or find another. Die or find another."

The message went on and on until the end of the page where it simply said "Die Die Die Die" over and over again.

Reader, my eyes are so heavy as I write this out. I know I will wake tomorrow and likely not have control again. The ring seems it will take another in my place, but how? And how many others? 

I cannot live like this and I cannot curse another with all the destruction that this ring has brought to my life...or can I? What do we know of our character until we're truly challenged with an impossible situation? Do we understand the man in the fox hole who runs in terror after years of war? I feel like I must find another and give the ring what it wants. Maybe I could get my wife back, maybe I could get my wife back. My life could be perfect again. Maybe the ring did worse to me than it would another, maybe it will bring them good luck and I simply was unlucky in the dice roll. I'm sure I could tell the next person to just try it on for a little and put it away, it won't be as bad for them, I'm sure of it...yes, sure of it.

I'm so tired though, so tired my dear reader friends. I'm just going to lay down here, just for a little while.

Edit: Once again, the light of day brings clarity. I've also been blessed with news, my ex-wife has gotten engaged.

The ring took my wife from me and now this other man is going to take what was ripped from my arms? The ring won't kill me, I am going to use it to get back what was mine in the first place. 

I hear the ring whisper in my mind, even while awake. I'll get my wife back and get revenge on the man who took her from me. I think the ring would look nice on him, very nice indeed. Now, to plan, yes...to plan.
