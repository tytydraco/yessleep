Two years ago, I was a volunteer at a homeless shelter called St. Francis House in Boston.   
  
I'm not a humanitarian of any sort, just someone who was doing a little soul-searching and had extra time on their hands. I went every Monday and Thursday morning, typically to help serve their daily free breakfast and lunch.   
  
On some days, I would be allowed to help at the clothing bank. That was the work I enjoyed the most, especially when it came to shoes. Did you know that a lot of Boston’s homeless have trench foot? That doesn’t seem right, for the desperately poor to be marching around on feet crippled by a disease named after century-old warfare. But the city streets can be just as unforgiving as a battlefield, especially during the frigid winters. The poorly planned roads pool sleet and ice at every corner, and it only takes one misstep for the insidious grip of cold and wet to take hold. Proper shoes make a world of difference.  
  
I enjoyed the work because it was so personal. I would get paired one-to-one with people who were in especially dire need of new shoes, and carefully go through our donation stocks to find the perfect fitting sneaker or boot. There is something deeply dignifying about trying on shoes. It made them open up, and sometimes they would even tell me their story--what long, tumultuous roads they had traveled before they made it here. Sometimes, they would sink into wistful reminiscence–about the family they missed, or the life they might have had if just a few things had gone differently. Sometimes, they would just sit in quiet thought and only answer my questions, and that was welcome too.   
  
I was asked to help an old lady in her 70s. She had come in with bare-threaded shoes that had so many broken pieces, they were flapping about as she limped. She was a first-timer. Most of the people who came to the shelter were regulars, and it was rare to find someone as old as her unrecognized by even the longest-running staff. I took from our shelves 3 or 4 of the closest sized sneakers I could find and brought them to the small private room she was waiting in.  
  
Judith Pettigrew was one of those old ladies whose spines curled them so far over themselves, that when they peered up at others, their whole bodies shuddered under the effort. I kneeled down to spare her that, stooping to eye level and putting on my friendliest face. One of her eyes was lazy and filled with milky white, dragging behind as her other one lifted slowly to look at me. She was so quiet and unassuming, only nodding a little when prompted. The tiny blue age spots clustered by her cheek reminded me of my own grandmother, who passed away when I was little.   
  
One of the first things I noticed was that there was something really off about the way she smelled. As I introduced myself, I took shallow breaths, trying to inhale via mouth rather than nose. I was accustomed to body odour by now, but this wasn't the familiar sharp sourness of accumulated oil and sweat. It was stale and musty, a stench that settled in my nose until I could feel it fuzzy on the back of my tongue. It smelled of sticky warmth and choking humidity, and even though the room was frigid, I felt sweat begin to bead on my temples. I resisted the urge to cough, not out of any polite reason, but because I instinctively felt that I shouldn't disturb the air.   
  
I gently grasped her leg as I started to work her left shoe off. She had several layers of pants and socks on, no doubt to keep warm from Boston's night air. I immediately regretted not having gloves on. As my fingers dug into the fabric of her pant leg, I viscerally felt how unnaturally spongy and thick it was, like several of the layers had eroded and fused together. It was actually hard to keep a hold onto it, but Judith sat very still and allowed me to proceed without much trouble.   
  
Her shoes were so deconstructed, that after I cut the laces off, the whole thing sort of just peeled away like the loose skin of an overripe fruit. The sole was much harder to remove. It caked into the bottom of her foot, a matted mix of rubber, sock, and dead skin that was glued together by sticky black sludge. I couldn't tell where it ended and she began. I tugged at it harder and, feeling brave, pressed my fingernails along the crease where I estimated the curve of her foot to be, trying to find some purchase to pry it apart without hurting her. I glanced at her to make sure she was okay, as I was going to start pulling quite hard, but she sat undisturbed, quietly acquiescing.  
  
It came apart reluctantly, with a sharp squelching and ripping sound as a seam slowly opened up. Cold, wet grime was squeezed out from the areas where my fingers grasped for purchase. It was street grime, dirty snow mixed with motor oil and eroded trash. I pulled the sole away just enough so that I could expose part of her actual foot. I peered close, searching for any sign of raw flesh.  
  
Under the black goo revealed a dark, mottled landscape. Was that her skin? A pungent odor of rot hit me a second later, and I recoiled, dropping everything. Her foot hit the floor with a wet slap. I fell backwards and collapsed into a wheezing fit, twisting my head away from the source so as to not breath in whatever that was too deeply.   
  
I heard Judith shift.   
  
"Sorry!" I exclaimed, mortified at my own behavior.   
  
When I looked back at her, my heart suddenly lurched in my ribcage, and a faintness overtook me as my pulse started beating madly. The woman was staring straight at me, eyes as wide as they could go. It was like what I had done had turned on a switch. She started breathing hard, jaw twitching. I expected her to look uncomfortable, or even angry at me, but there was only pure panic across her face like she'd just woken up out of a nightmare. She swayed and began to run both her hands up and down the sides of her neck, rubbing hard at first, then fingertips digging in, tearing. Her mouth moved, but only weak gasps of air came out.   
  
I noticed with a start that what I had first dismissed as age spots on her face were in fact not age spots at all. Her bloated skin contorted uncannily with every terrified gasp, every wayward jerk, and it became clear that they were actually little clusters of blue mold. There was a faint white webbing spread all across her face--not the dry lines of age, but creeping fungus. *Oh god, if I could already see it, how deep had it set?* I imagined it--fibrous roots winding through her whole body, seeping rot and poison, harvesting all the precious nutrients from her organs, her small bundled figure a perfect refuge for spores to germinate in an otherwise too-harsh winter.  
  
Judith's movements only grew in intensity. She was going to hurt herself. I reached forwards and grabbed her arms to at least stop the tearing. The way she twisted against me was with unnatural strength. I looked around wildly for help but could see nobody in view through the small windows along the side of the waiting room. She gasped louder, more desperate, but I held on. I could see the deep scores her own fingernails had left in her flesh, angry gashes in her paper-thin skin that revealed stinking broken sinew underneath. She thrashed, and I cried in horror as her wounds tore wider with every movement. I called for help as best I could, not daring to leave her at her own mercy. I called her name. "Judith stop," I pleaded. "You're hurting yourself."   
  
Droplets of grimy goo quivered and swelled between the creases of my fingers, like scum squeezed out of a dirty sponge. My knuckles were bone-white as I kept a tight grip on her. The smell of rot now permeated so strongly it made my eyes sting and breath ragged, like the stench was crawling down my throat and spreading sand along my airways. I had a sudden premonition of what was about to happen. A memory flashed of my childhood in the fields behind my house, where I would often play, chasing grasshoppers. When I finally caught one, I held the thing up in triumph, pinching it by its big jumpy legs with my thumb and forefinger so that it couldn't bite me or get away. I ran to my father to show him how expertly I had caught it. By the time he looked, the grasshopper had escaped, and all that was left between my fingers was a pair of grasshopper legs.   
  
"Sometimes, they get too scared," he said. "They jump so hard they leave their legs behind."  
  
*Crack. Crack, crack.* Three loud cracks, and then Judith writhed and broke against me. Suddenly the only things left upright were her two bony arms that were still caught in my grasp. Her body sagged, seeped, and then finally heaved in a slow, macabre exhale that lasted for too long. Noxious air whistled weakly out of torn neck. Black bubbles frothed at the edges of her, just like the tar that oozes out of scared grasshoppers. I let go of her and she collapsed in the sludge that was gathering around her. I wanted to scream and retch, but I choked back any sound, and it wasn't until I burst through the door and bent over sobbing and gasping that I realized that I had been holding my breath for a very long time.   
  
Just like that, Judith was gone.  
  
The police came and talked to me, but they didn't really press me for details. I don't think they cared much. The officer who took my statement only looked bored as he waited for me to haltingly describe my experience. I only heard later, through the rumor mill, that the coroner had trouble determining time of death. Her level of decomposition when they examined her was far beyond a few days, or weeks even.  
  
I was a total mess afterwards. I took the rest of my semester off. I kept feeling like there was something wrong with me, like I had inhaled something of her that I couldn't get rid of. My doctor was very patient with me, at first. I asked for every test to be performed. I asked for superfluous scans. He joked once about seeing truffles growing in my lungs, but once he saw the look on my face, he quickly muttered an apology.   
  
I relived Judith’s death every night in my dreams. I spent many hours laying in bed as the sweat in my sheets cooled, thinking of her. In that haze of insomnia, I researched. She had one estranged son who lived on the other side of the country. She rented a small apartment. She played bingo weekly at the local senior center.   
  
My therapist told me in no uncertain terms that looking for Judith was hindering my healing process, so I eventually did as I was told, and stopped looking. And the therapy did help. I packaged my trauma neatly and tossed it to the wayside. Though I would still catch glimpses of her on the street sometimes, I learned to ignore it. I moved on, made new friends and hobbies, earned a degree and got a steady job. My life was full and there was no longer any room left to ruminate on morbid things I did not understand.   
  
Which brings me to now. It's been two years since Judith.   
  
Last week, I took a business trip to Chicago. Did some sightseeing on company money. I found myself at the Art Institute of Chicago, staring transfixed at a painting. It was titled *That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door)*. The painting depicted a crumbling, warped Victorian door decorated by a faded funeral wreath. The colors were dark and drab. It looked less like a door and more like a coffin. When I spotted the old wrinkled hand at the edge of the picture, I snatched my own hand as if it had been stung.  
  
The hand was Judith’s hand. Even though I hadn’t thought of her in over a year, I knew it to be true. My blood rushed loudly in my ears. She was there, on the other side of that door. I could hear her weak, stuttering breaths again. The ‘*Crack. Crack, Crack.*’ of her breaking echoed in the museum’s wide halls. Even that nauseating stench returned, filling my nostrils and stinging my eyes. I stayed in front of that door for a long time listening to her death throes. When the museum staff finally ushered me out, it was dark outside.   
  
I started writing this on the flight back home. I made up my mind, then—I decided that I wanted to know Judith Pettigrew.  
  
I feel a connection with her. It’s silly, we crossed paths for only a few minutes, and I honestly can’t even be sure she was actually alive during that time. But I just can’t forget how she looked at the very end. She kept gasping, like she wanted to tell me something. She was so scared, but of what?   
  
I just *need* answers. I… I can’t tell if it’s just for selfish reasons, or if I genuinely care for her. I feel like I do. I feel horrible for her. It twists my guts when I think about the fact that nobody really remembers her anymore. At best, she’s some spooky story to tell over happy hour drinks. Not for me though. No, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her ever since I saw the Door, and not just during my waking moments.   
  
I’ve started dreaming about her again. Last night she locked eyes with me and told me in a strange voice that she hated me. I looked at her in surprise.   
  
“I thought you couldn’t speak,” I said.   
  
Her eyes widened at that, and she began to tear at her throat.
