Back when I was younger, maybe around 10 to 11 years old, I had heard from some neighbours that a guy on the level below me, level 3, turned out to be a mass murderer and cannibal, obviously my parents where scared for our safety so we moved about 2 hours away, we had always been tight on money so it was really the best we could do. After the guy was eventually put into prison for life and the incident died down, everything went back to normal. The rest of my teen years where as you would expect. But eventually when I was 19 I started going to university, that meant I had to move closer back to where I used to live so the trip there wouldn't be so long, and so I wouldn't have to get up to early in the morning just to make it too my classes. 

I lived in a small house with a couple of other people around my age but my job didn't exactly pay well since it was a retail job. I struggled to pay rent every time it was due, so eventually i moved back into the old apartment block I used to live in before we moved away, unfortunately for me the only available room that I could afford was 317, the room where that man would kill and eat people, you would think that they would block off the room forever, I can't imagine anyone would want to live there, even temporarily, but apparently not. The thought of living there made my stomach churn, but what other option did I have? It was either live on the street, or live in an apartment with a fucked up past. I would gladly take the latter considering it was winter and where I live, winters can get very intense, 
I had learnt from the front desk that they provide students or anyone with a low income free food for the first week. Honestly I wasn't too keen on eating food that's been in a fridge for who knows how long, but free food is free food.

 I eventually moved in, I didn't really have much to unpack because as I mentioned earlier my family had always had struggles with money. So it really only took a couple of hours to unpack everything, then I decided to take a look in the fridge, god sometimes I wish I just left it alone, bought a whole new fridge, even if that meant starving for a short while... when I looked inside there was a bowl of grapes with a soft plastic seal on top, some frozen meat, some milk, some vegetables, you know the everyday kinda foods. I closed the fridge. I decided to call my friend over to let him see the room, I also wish I never did that, sometimes I think it would've just been better to live in ignorance. 

He came over and we started chatting, after maybe half an hour of small talk about whatever, I noticed my stomach rumbling, I asked him "Hey I totally forgot too ask, do you want anything to eat or drink?" He politely declined but I still stood up and went to the fridge and snatched the bowl of grapes. I walked back to the living room stood in front of the couch where my friend sat. I peeled the plastic off the bowl and picked up a grape with my fingers, my friend was going on about something, looking down at his phone, he looked back up as I put the grape up to my mouth, his face completely drained, devoid of all colour.
The next thing I know he started wailing and screaming, he stood up and tried to back away from me. "Dude? What's up with you?! What happened?!" I quickly questioned him, "What's wrong? What's fucking wrong?! You're a fucking sicko man!" I was, taken aback until eventually looked down at my hand expecting a grape but I was instead met with an eye, a fucking eye, sat there in my hand. I screamed and threw it on the ground. The whole bowl was filled with eyes, lone, dead eyes. What the fuck.

When I picked the bowl up and when I looked at it in the fridge it was all grapes. What happened. I felt my mouth water and my stomach bubble. Seconds later my ground was covered in my vomit and my mouth had that awful after taste of stomach acid.

After a couple of seconds I ran too the fridge and swung the door open, I was expecting all the food I had seen earlier but I was instead met with human flesh, fingers, eyes, teeth, and at the very bottom... a head, a head with a permanent look of sadness and terror on its face. It's eyes completely gone and the innards of its mouth hollowed out. It took me a second but I finally realised who the head belonged too. The old woman who lived a couple of rooms down from my old one. But how?! She died years ago. Way too long for her head to still have flesh on it. I thought the police and crime scene cleaners cleared this place out years ago?

By that point I hadn't even noticed my friend had ran out of my room and down the fire escape stairs. This has to be some kind of mistake, some kind of prank, some kind of sick prank pulled by someone with no morality or decency. No, the head and eyes felt and looked too real. It's been hours since the incident, my friend had blocked me on all social media platforms. What irked me was he never called the police. That had to say something about who he was really. But that's not important right now. I still don't understand how this happened, those peoples parts where supposed to be thrown out by now, years ago, even if they weren't thrown out, why weren't they decayed? They looked completely fresh. Jesus, I don't even know what's left from right, up from down. All I know is I'm never eating again, even if it means my demise.
