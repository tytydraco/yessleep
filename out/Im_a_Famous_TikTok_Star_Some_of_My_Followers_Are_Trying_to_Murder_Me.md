 

“Whhhhhat’s up Tik to the Tok, it’s ya boy FamousDev6969 back with another ba-ba-ba-banger!” 

As I sit here watching one of my old videos and reflecting on my life choices, I can’t help but think that maybe I took this influencer stuff a liiiiittle too far. I mean, sure, it added some supplemental income, and yeah, the fame was pretty nice, but I’m starting to get the idea that I might have fucked up. 

They’re down there. My loyal subje- I mean, fans, that is. They’re standing on my front lawn, staring up at me sitting high and mighty inside of my multi-million dollar mansion, all googly-eyed and awestruck. They’re obsessed with me. But instead of basking in the glory of my stardom, now, I’m downright terrified. Because my fans have turned into a bunch of brainless psychopaths. And they won’t stop until my blood is spilled. 

“That wraps it up for today, everyone! Don’t forget to smash that subscribe button, slap a like on this video, and da-da-da-ding that bell so you never miss another post! Peace out!”

I was snatched from my reverie by that absolute *heater* of an outro. I mean, damn that was original. My genius truly knows no bounds. But that same genius is what landed me in this mess in the first place. I guess I should explain before my followers turn my brains inside out. 

Corbin had always been my best friend. He’d known me since before I was famous. You know, living that disgusting *plebeian* lifestyle. Gross. To think that I was ever one of those wretched normies gives me chills. 

“Devan, all I’m saying is, I think you should cut back on the influencer stuff. It’s really starting to get to your head.”

“Corb, it’s not getting to my head. I’m just trying to make something of myself. I’m surrounded by success. You’re the son of a famous director, my next door neighbor is a retired tennis star, and my uncle worked alongside *the* Jordan Belfort. I just want my slice of the spotlight. Not to mention the endorsement deals,” I grinned, flashing him a wink. 

“Devan. First off, you have two thousand followers-”

“Two thousand fifty-nine, actually.”

“Whatever. Two thousand *fifty-nine* followers. Two, the only “endorsement deal” you’ve ever gotten is an extra five dollars tacked onto your three thousand dollar monthly allowance from your parents to *stop* filming them. And third, your uncle is in jail. He committed large-scale fraud. That’s nothing to be proud of.”

“Ya know what Corbo? You sound like a grade-A hater right now. Well, ya know what I have to say to that? Hi hater, bye hater,” I said, pride shimmering like the star I was as I marched toward the front door. 

“Come on, dude! You’re really going to hit me with some old-ass rap lyrics from like 2009 and stomp out the door? You’re losing it, Dev…”

“Freaking Corbin. I’ll show him,” I huffed as I slipped into the front seat of my brand-new Maserati. 

Who the hell did he think he was? Trying to put someone like me in my place. The nerve of that guy! That lit a fire under me. I was determined to make Corbin eat his words. I’d rack up more followers that he could even count. 

With a burning ambition in my heart, I streamed my drive home on TikTok as I raced through the streets, past more of my potential worship- sorry, I did it again. Fans. More of my potential fans. I spritzed a few eye drops into my pupils beforehand, of course. Gotta play it up for the camera. 

“Wh-what’s up you guys. It’s your boy FamousDev6969. Sorry brodies and broettes, just give me a sec,” I said as I blew into a tissue. (My car comes with a built-in tissue dispenser, in case you were wondering.)

“So I just left my friend’s house, right? I’m not gonna name drop him because I’m the bigger man here, but it starts with a “C” and ends with an “orbin” if you want to take a guess at it. Well, C-orbin tried to shit all over my hopes and dreams, everyone. You hear that? He tried to climb on top of all my aspirations and take a big, fat dookie all over them. News flash. It didn’t work, you sissy beta soyboy. If you’re watching this, I want you all to go dox him right now. Link to his address in the description. Peace out.” 

Did I go a little overboard? Probably. Did Corbin deserve it? Yeah, he did. I think my actions were justified. 

As I pulled into my personal garage (my house has five), the wheels in my brain started turning. How could I amass a following quickly without needing to over-exert myself? A light bulb flickered on in my brain. Surely the internet would have an answer. The internet knows everything, right? I YouTubed the first thing my ever-so-talented brain spat out. 

*How to grt a follwing on Tiktok realy fast.* 

I knew there were plenty of typos, but I couldn’t stop myself from hitting the search button. It was as if my fingers had a mind of their own. I had officially entered mastermind mode.  

I continued to scroll through click-baity ads until I came across something that caught my eye. Obviously the thumbnail was a super hot baddie, or else I probably wouldn’t have given it a second thought, but that’s beside the point. I had just struck gold. Or so I thought. I eagerly pressed play on the video, itching to prove Corbin wrong.

I was mesmerized as the smoking-hot blonde chick sang into my ear, “Step one: download our software for a small fee of $79.95. All you have to do is click the link in our bio! Step two: gain a plethora of new, *real* followers! It’s that simple!”

I paused the video. I didn’t need to see any more. I was sold. 

I purchased the software immediately. I know eighty dollars seems like a lot of money to some people, but when you’re this wealthy, it’s a drop in the bucket. 

“Hey Raul,” I said, sauntering into Dad’s office. 

“Yes, Sir Devan?” Raul said, nodding at me dutifully as I approached. 

“I know you’re Dad’s personal assistant, not mine, but Dad can’t seem to find me one that’s worth a crap, so can I ask you to do something for me?”

“What is the nature of your request?” 

“I downloaded this new software onto my phone. Can you make sure it’s not going to give me a virus or some shit?” 

“I will run it through my VPN,” he said as I handed him my phone. 

Raul turned away from me. I couldn’t see what he was doing, but it didn’t take long at all. After about ten seconds, he returned my phone to me. 

“Everything is in order. My VPN detected no viruses. Please keep in mind that tips are greatly appreciated,” he said, a smile blossoming across his lips. 

“Oh yeah, thanks. Here’s a tip for ya. Don’t eat the yellow snow. But if you do, this should help with your bad breath,” I smirked, slapping a stick of mint gum into his outstretched hand. Raul stared at me blankly. 

“Come on, that was a good one! Yellow snow? It’s piss. Get it? I saw it on YouTube shorts. Anyway, thanks for the help,” I said, turning to leave. I could have sworn that I heard Raul tell me to go screw myself, but I chalked it up to the noisy air conditioner. Raul loves me. How could he not?

I plopped down on the couch and waited for TikTok to load up. It was taking a while after the update. Once I logged on, I noticed something. I had forty-five new followers, and that number was steadily climbing. 

“Wow, this thing really works. Awesome,” I muttered, preparing to film another video. 

“Whhhat’s up you guys, it’s ya boy, FamousDev6969 comin’ right back at ya with another killer video! I wanted to give an update for all the new followers. My guy Raul just helped me install this totally bad-ass new software that’ll help me engage with you guys better! Got some *seriously* cool stuff planned. You guys are gonna flip. That’s it for now. Stay awesome! Peace.”

The moment I uploaded it, my comments were flooded. All of them were positive too, which is strange. Usually I would’ve had at least three death threats and seven people telling me to delete my account. But not this time. I was on the up-and-up. 

I went to sleep that night completely satisfied with my progress. Corbin would eat his words whenever I decided to unblock his number. I couldn’t wait to see the look on his face. 

When I awoke, I immediately checked my phone. My follower count had *exploded* overnight. My eyes nearly popped out of my skull when they fell to the number on my screen. 350k. I know I’m awesome, but fuck. That kind of growth is mind-blowing. 

I decided to sift through the comments on my latest videos. My heart was filled to the brim when I read through them. 

*I love you Dev!*

*You’re awesome, man, keep up the great work!* 

*When’s the meet and greet?? I can’t get enough of this guy!*

Wow. I was touched. I didn’t know people on the internet knew what kindness was. All I’d ever received were hate comments. But that last one sparked an idea. A meet and greet. That’d boost my popularity for sure. My intelligence is off the charts.

I unblocked Corbin’s number as I sashayed into the kitchen. I decided to give him a call. He seemed shocked when he picked up the phone. As if he hadn’t expected to hear from me. 

“Hey Corbin. I just thought I’d fill you in on-”

“Holy shitballs! Dev? Like FamousDev6969?? You know I’m your biggest fan, right? I can’t believe I’m talking to you right now. You are my fucking idol.”

“Uh… Thanks? Corbin, are you okay? I mean, I know I’m great and all, but you’re acting like we’ve never met before, dude.”

“What are you talking about? I wish I’d met you in real life, bro. You’re my hero.”

“Alright, Corbin. I don’t know why you’re acting so strange, but if this is a prank, it’s a pretty lame one. Two thumbs down. I’m gonna go now. You should see a doctor or something, man.”

“Wait no, Dev, don’t hang up on me! Just let me-”

*Click.* 

I hung up on Corbin and threw his number right back on my list of blocked contacts. He was acting weird and I wasn’t gonna let that bring me down. 

“Hey, Devan. What’s it gonna be this morning?” Santi said, shooting me a grin. If I didn’t mention it before, Santi is our personal chef. I know you peasants can’t relate. It’s okay. Not many can. 

“I’m gonna skip breakfast this morning, Sant. Got an influencer event.” 

“Good luck,” he replied, flashing me a thumbs up. I returned the gesture as I headed out the door. I try to refrain from interacting with the staff most of the time, but Santi is cool, I guess. Best to stay on his good side so he doesn’t mix rat turds into my food like the last chef. 

I briefly pondered which car I should take before swiping a set of keys from the wall. I settled into the driver’s seat of a lime green luxury sports car. It was feeling like a Lambo kind of day. I started filming as I floored it down the road. I’d totally forgotten to let my admirers know about the event. 

“Whaaaat’s up you guys, it’s ya boy FamousDev6969 hittin’ you with another certified banger. I’ve got some exciting news for all of you! I’ll be doing a meet and greet in, uh, twelve minutes at Central Plaza! If you’re in the area, come by and see my face with your own eyes! Can’t wait to meet you dudes and dudettes! Be there or be squarular. Peace.”

Geez, I will never get over how cool I am. Who can compare? Nobody, that’s who. 

I was having trouble finding parking, so I took a handicap spot. Who cares if I get another ticket? I already had three that week. 

I stepped out of the car and marched to the center of the plaza. Everyone seemed to be going about their business, noses buried in their phones. Strange that none of my adoring fans had recognized me yet. I decided to announce my presence. 

I cupped my hands over my mouth and shouted at the top of my lungs, “HELLO, MY LOYAL SUBJECTS! I, FAMOUS DEV, HAVE ARRIVED!”

I received a few odd looks and glares from the crowd, but nobody approached me. Huh. Maybe they were too shy. It must be daunting to meet someone of my status. 

I was about to resign to the fact that my first ever influencer event was a dud, when I saw him. A man who looked to be in his mid-thirties was relentlessly shoving past people, fighting through the masses. Even if he wasn’t coming for me, I felt obligated to watch. 

He continued to knock people aside, running at full speed in my direction. Once the man was within shouting range, he yelled to me, waving frantically. 

“Hey! Hey, Dev! I’m your biggest fan!” 

I gave a polite wave in return as the man caught up to me. He slapped his hands onto his knees, attempting to catch his breath. I noted that he was wearing business attire, which he was beginning to sweat through profusely.  

“I s-skipped a meeting with a… whew, that took a lot out of me.”

“It’s cool bro, chill.”

“Right,” he said, straightening his tie and taking a deep breath. “I lost a big client for this, but I just *had* to meet you. I’m your biggest fan. Can I get your signature? I brought my own personal FamousDev6969 T-shirt.”

“Uh, I guess. You made a shirt with my face on it? Not gonna lie dude, that’s kinda weird,” I said, scribbling an indecipherable mess onto the fabric with the sharpie he’d given me. 

“I’m sorry, man, I just love all of your content. It felt right.”

“Makes sense, I guess. I am pretty irresistible,” I smirked, handing him back the T-shirt. 

“Awesome, thanks! Picture time!” 

The guy wrapped an arm around me and shoved a phone in my face before I had time to react. I was starting to get the ick with how aggressive he was acting. 

“This is the best day of my life, man. Alright, this next question might be taking it over the line, but, like, can I have a strand of your hair? Or maybe a fingernail clipping or something? I want to carry a part of you with me wherever I go.” His eyes looked manic. Like a deprived junkie who was finally about to get his fix. It sent a chill rippling through my body. 

“What? Fuck no, that’s hella creepy. I’m leaving,” I said, turning my back to the man. He abrasively clasped a hand onto my shoulder. 

“Please man, I love you. I-” 

“Don’t touch me! Screw off!” I screamed, bolting through the crowd. 

The man gave chase, pleading with me to return all the while… and he wasn’t alone. I began to hear more voices shouting my name. 

“Devan, over here!”

“Hey Dev! Huge fan!” 

“I love you, Devan!” 

I always wanted praise, but this was over the top. These people were completely unhinged. I looked back only once, and I immediately regretted it. 

There was a small gang of around fifteen people sprinting after me. Adrenaline surged through my veins like venom. What was up with these freaks? 

I barely reached my car in time. I threw open the door and smashed the lock button. The original crazed weirdo slammed his fists against my window as I peeled out of the parking lot. I felt a crunched under my tire followed by a howl of pain. 

“Guys, my foot just got run over by Famous Dev!!”

“Aw, you’re so lucky! Why couldn’t it have been me?” 

What. The. Fuck. My heart pounded against my ribcage like a drum as I zoomed home. I felt disgusted. What could have elicited that kind of reaction? I screeched to a halt in the garage and beelined straight for my room. I needed answers. 

I locked the door and opened up TikTok. My blood turned to ice when I saw the most liked comment on my latest video. 

*Hey guys, I just followed Famous Dev home! He lives at 6320 Forest Drive! Let’s all go show him our support!!* 

What? I hadn’t even noticed anybody behind me. I should have been more careful. Now I’m going to pay the price. 

I closed the app and switched to YouTube. I clicked on the video I’d watched the previous day, hoping there was something I’d missed. As it turns out, there was. I skipped past step two to the thirty second tidbit at the end. The smoking-hot babe looked deathly serious now. 

“This is a disclaimer. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR TIKTOK. This may result in dismemberment, severe injury, and/or death. Thanks for watching!” 

My face drained of color. I should have paid more attention. Now, they’re coming. I don’t have much longer. Those psychos at my door now, and I can hear them calling. 

“I want his left ear!” 

“I got dibs on his teeth!”

“I call his right eye!”

I’ve barricaded the door, but it’s only a matter of time before they make it through. This will be my final post before I’m forced to give my worshippers what they want. Fingers crossed that they’ll go easy on me. FamousDev6969 logging off. [Peace out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
