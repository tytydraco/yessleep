I know this seems silly,even maybe funny after reading the title.And I'll be honest ,I thought it was a bit funny myself when it first started happening.But now,I'm only getting more terrified .

So I am a senior in high school.I play high school football and run track and field for my school.And I'm by no means a star athlete but I am well known in sports due to my name alone

Many family members have gone to this same school and almost all of them played at least 1 sport during their years year,including my mother who played softball and basketball in the early 1990's.

So yeah I get it,you're probably thinking I'm some spoiled rich kid that had everything handed to me but that's far from the truth.

I'm the oldest of 3 siblings.My dad died in a car crash when I was 7, and mom never really got over him in the slightest and hasn't dated since his death .We live in a nice but fairly small and a bit older home, in a decent area and all and we get by fairly decently But that's about it.

Now that you know I'm not a stereotypical athlete meathead,I hope you guys won't think I deserve any of this.

So I have been on varsity since I was a sophomore and am a running back on offense and a safety on defense .I didn't get to start much as a sophomore as a 4 star recruit junior, was the running back and our safety was a senior and a 5 star recruit.I played a very minor role 


I played alot of defense as a junior though, and did pretty well even though I knew I had nothing on the safety that I backed up,who went to Florida University .I also played more on offense as well as the 4 star RB ahead of me had a bit of a knee injury problem for a decent chunk of the season 

But I too ended up with a leg injury towards the end of the year and I was pretty frustrated by that.I worked and conditioned like crazy a few months after I healed,determined to have a great football season as a senior

So our season started last week and it was against a league rival of ours.We have a fairly small league where I am from, that consist of 4 total teams and we all play each other twice a year (a home and away game each time)to total 6 games,and we all schedule 3 or 4 non league opponents to play every year as well .

This same team beat us in our second matchup last year(we had won the previous 6 matchups against them at that point) when we hosted them with them getting a late touchdown with less than 30 seconds left in the game to seal it.They taunted us and our crowd after the game and their coaches didn't even make them apologize  which infuriated us.

So we were so pumped and determined to return the favor as it was going to be at their home field.It was a damn close game from start to finish but we had a poetic ending with a late touchdown ourselves, followed by forcing an interception by their QB,deep in our territory on their last drive to seal the win.


We taunted the hell out of them and got our crowd and cheerleaders involved as well.As we were heading back to the locker room,their mascot was standing by the fence all alone which we found weird

Most of my teammates ahead of me made some funny comments to the mascot as they walked by.I was the last one behind them and stopped to talk trash to it.


It is green and dark blue and is supposed to be an eagle but looks more like a turkey that needs a haircut or something.

I began to taunt the thing's appearance and their school in general,just to annoy the person inside the costume.I also made fun of it for being a lousy and creepy bird for just standing there like a weirdo before laughing and walking away.


But before I opened the door that led to the locker room,I turned back to the mascot that was still standing there in the darkening backround of the football stadium behind it,and was watching me.I was a bit creeped out but for some reason that I honestly don't know why(and regret) that I would "see it around"

The mascot stared at me with it's non blinking eyes and unmoving mouth for a moment before eagerly nodding it's head in agreement.I quickly headed towards the locker room and told everyone about what I just expirenced.

They all laughed and said that those mascots are always the awkward students that just wanna make people feel even more awkward.We all talked about Katie who is our mascot and is a bit like that 

We laughed and made a few jokes before changing out of our uniforms and into our normal clothes to get on the 45 minute bus ride home .

As the shuttle was about to leave,I noticed movement outside of the dark window and took a better look...that strange bird mascot standing not far away,swaying slowly back and forth staring at ME with it's unseeing eyes.

Before I could really react or say something,the shuttle started driving which put me at an unexplainable ease


I decided not to tell anyone about it as I chalked it up to my imagination and figured the mascot creeped me out more than I thought 

But here is the thing.Ever since then,I know something weird is off.That person....that *thing* has been stalking me ever since


When I got to school the next morning,I saw a car pull up next to mine and when I looked over to see who it was,...that fucking same mascot from the other school staring at me,but when I blinked,it was just some normal guy in there instead giving me a concerned look

I didn't bother to notice anything and got out of my car to go to class .It didn't make it any better.

I've seen it standing behind me in mirrors,only to find nothing behind me when I turn around,I look at small groups of people and I'll see it among them for a few seconds before it is actually just another student, I even saw it mowing the lawn of our school before it disappeared to reveal our normal school janitor in it's place 



It even follows me away from school.When I got home today I was greeted by my mom's body but her head was replaced with that mascots head .When it spoke it was using my mom's voice and asked me how school was today.Its mouth opened to reveal sharp teeth as it spoke.

I screamed like a baby and ran out of the house and my mom called me like 5 times from behind but I ignored her and kept running

I don't know what's going on.I am not going home for my car.I am walking down a busy city street right now and everytime I look at someone,that mascot is near me


A homeless man with it's head,mockingly asking me for money,I even walked pass a billboard with a blue background and a picture of that damn mascot dead in the center, literally just pointing down at me before it disappeared to reveal a law firm billboard it it's place


I don't know what to do or what's going on.Please help
