My job is one that I know no one will be too jealous to hear. I work in a small town in the middle of nowhere Midwest. The town had a serious issue with roadkill, every day there is around twenty different incidences of roadkill, and guess who gets to tally them and clean them up. I started working here after I graduated from Highschool, my parents wanted me out of the house, I convinced one of my friends to let me live with them, promising to pay rent. Once I moved in, they had a room fully set up for me already. I paid as much as I could upfront, he handed me back half, and that was it. The next day I would reach out to the townhall, one thing led to the next, and boom, I’m a Roadkill Archivist.

The first day was simple, following my boss and helping file reports of vehicles hitting animals, all reports come through the police. People call them, then the police call us, then we file and schedule a “cleaning crew.” The second day however was more interesting, one officer called in with a singular report, “Deer, Highway 33, Code Imbus.” Then he hung up, I looked to my boss, Hugh, and showed him the report, he sighed and slowly stood.

“Come on Nick, time for your first Imbus.” I stood and put on the bright yellow coat.

“What’s a code Imbus? Is it just some slang for roadkill?” He paused and sighed, before grabbing the keys for our truck and leading me out the door.

“I’ll explain it more when we get there.”

Arriving to the site of the Roadkill, I saw the corpse, pausing I looked to Hugh. “How old is it?”

“Just occurred. No more than thirty minutes ago.” The corpse of the Buck had its flesh clung to its bones, tight like the string on a roast, the flies festered. How did it just occur? There’s no way. “I planned on doing a rookie prank, placing a festering corpse out for you to clean, but looks like fate beat me to it.” We both approached slowly. “A code Imbus is an infected body. Don’t know what it is that’s infected it, but it sure as hell ain’t pretty.” I paused, he continued to approach it, I felt my breakfast coming up from the pit of my gut, I swallowed it back as I swear, I saw the dear shiver, the bones seemed to shake as Hugh finally stood only a foot away from it. 

“Why… do you know what it’s infected with?” Hugh nodded his head and grabbed the radio from his side.

“This is Hugh, we got a code Imbus, level 3, sending the rookie back to the main, send out whoever is available, over age.”

“Sending me back? Why, what’s going on?”

He quickly whipped around to look at me and shouted, “Get back to the office, if I’m not back by three O’clock, close down.” I didn’t argue, he handed me the truck keys and motioned me to drive back. I followed his command and drove back to the office. 

Upon returning, I looked through all our files looking for anything relating to a “Code Imbus” but there was nothing. Closest thing I found was a file underneath the name Imbus. So, I read through that. What I ended up finding was a report from 2021. This Mr. Imbus came across a deer on the side of the road, when he approached, the deer stood up and groaned. It slowly approached the man. Imbus ran back into his truck, and the deer ran into the side of his vehicle. The deer was reportedly shot multiple times before being considered dead. I ended up sneaking over to the copy machine and printed off a few copies for me to take. Thankfully, I was the only one in the building, or so I thought.

A woman’s voice spoke up from behind me while I was at the printer, “Hey, what are you doing?” I jumped and looked at her. She was wearing a black wind breaker with some yellow lettering on it, “FBI.”  
“I’m just looking through files ma’am, I’m new here, it’s my second day.” She seemed to look at me, as if I became a suspect to something I didn’t know about. “What brings the FBI here?”

She looked at me confused and responded, “You haven’t heard about the disappearances?” I shook my head, and she handed me a small notebook from the inside of her jacket, “I arrived three weeks ago, there were multiple reports of people going missing around the area, but now that I’ve arrived, they’ve stopped.” The notebook had notes about each of the last known locations of the people and other descriptions of what was found around them. 

“This feels like you shouldn’t be showing me it.” I handed her back the notebook and she shrugged.

“Ain’t anything going on that isn’t public. What’s strange is that as soon as I arrived, all the disappearances stopped.” I looked at her and she nodded, she seemed to be almost certain that it isn’t just coincidence. “So, what can I do for you, I imagine there’s a reason you’re talking to me.” She handed me a card, looking at it, there was a phone number and her name, Jess. I looked up and she pointed at it before speaking.

“Give me a call when you’re home, I’ll be waiting.” She left and I just stared at the card.

I’m back home now, the report came in and I now know more about these “Imbus” Codes. Turns out, I was sent away because it’s highly infectious the younger you are. Here’s what else I learned:

The infection itself seems to target the muscle tissue around the bones of these animals, following that, a fungus like material will grow in a thin layer over the bones, the deer will then be “resurrected” by this fungus and walk into traffic. The files end there, but I have a few theories as to why it does that, one of them would mean that maybe this infection, isn’t truly an infection. I’m debated calling Jess, until giving in, and giving her a call to see what she wanted from me. 

I woke up the next morning, Jess wanted to meet and discuss further details about our phone call. Waking up, I walked to to the kitchen and grabbed some water looking out the window. The winter in the Midwest has this ethereal vibe, it was six in the morning, and the sun had not even risen yet. I could feel the coldness sink off the windows and the streetlamps lit up the neighborhood. My friend was still asleep, I made sure not to make too much noise while I stared at the shape of a man lying on the suburban street. He seemed to twitch as he lied there, his skin was tight to his bones and I just stared, one word echoed in my mind, “Imbus.”

I slowly reached for my phone in the pocket of my pajama pants. I began to dial 911, when I saw the man stand up slowly, it looked as if something I couldn’t see was pulling him upwards. “911, what’s your emergency?” I sat silent before snapping out of the trance and responding to the operator on the other side. 

“I’d like to report some, uh, shit, I’d like to report a code Imbus, highest level.” The other side remained silent, I sat and watched the man, now standing, drag his feet away, and the voice on the other end of the line changed.

“Is it still there?” I swallowed and watched it walk away, its jaw hung open and feet leaving a trail of blood and skin as it dragged along.

“No… it’s dragging itself away now, being dragged, I can’t tell.”

“We’ll send a clean-up crew soon. For now, please stay put and on the line while officers and crew arrive.” I heard her turn to someone in her chair, she said something to them, but I couldn’t quite make it out. The man was gone by then, and all I did was wait.

By the time the police and cleaning crew arrived, the sun had begun to peak over the trees. My friend had awoken, and he walked around in the house getting ready for the day. Neighbors, in their nosy behavior, stood on their porches, watching us, and whispering to each other. My boss ended up approaching me, “So, did you bring it out here Nick?”

“What? No, why the hell would I do that? Who do you think I am?” I shouted at him, I put a hand on my head and turned away from him, “Why’s everyone look surprised? Isn’t this normal?”

“Not this far into town.” He looked around and then paused as he saw an old black sedan pulled up, the yellow headlights lit up the trail the body left behind. As the vehicle turned off, Jess walked out and approached. My boss walked up to greet her along with the Chief of Police. I sat and looked at the direction in which the corpse dragged to. I then watched as the team that chased it down, slowly drove towards us. I waited, my mind running with what ifs. What if they found it? What if they didn’t? What if they’re infected?

As they approached, everyone gathered around and the driver of the truck hopped out, he removed a half mask, only covered his mouth, and he sighed. “The infection within the corpse is dead or Dormant. The body is in the back… it’s Donny.” Everyone removed their hats or equivelant and approached the back. It was silent as we stared at the corpse, once moving only an hour ago, now still and stiff. He looked no older than twenty.

Once everyone had left, my boss approached me again and wanted to speak, but nothing came out, he turned and walked away, only saying one sentence as he walked away, “See you Monday.” I watched him walk away; the red stain of the trail was still there. I decided, for whatever reason, to follow it. Jess can wait, it’s later in the day anyways.

Eventually I arrived at the woods line off Highway 33, they seemed silent, I guess I never noticed it because of the traffic that normally is here. I slowly entered the woods, listening for any semblance of life, still following the vague direction of the trail. Eventually I began to hear a noise of creaking. I paused and listened; my mind immediately reasoned that it was just the trees in the wind. Looking up, I was met with stillness, uncomfortably still. Looking around, the creaking grew louder. I began to backtrack to the woods line, hoping for exit. Then I saw something, a large humanoid with a bag over their head, I saw tears in it but couldn’t make make out anything in the tears, and it looked far from me, yet it seemed titanic in size. I ran, seeing the ridgeline I picked up speed and eventually emerged on the ditch of the highway. I looked back and saw it still staring at me, then I realized, did it chase me, or did I imagine how far I went in? I watched the non-human disappear, and I slowly walked back. I’m writing this all before my meeting with Jess. I’m still debating whether I tell her what I saw or keep it secret. I’ll update you all when I get the chance, until then, I got no idea what the hell I saw in those woods.
