My friend Eli wouldn’t stop tapping his flashlight like it was a drumstick.

Click—click—click.

It made the beam stutter across the weeds and the busted chain-link gate, like the place was flickering in and out of existence.

“Dude,” I said, keeping my voice low even though nobody was around, “you’re gonna kill the battery before we even get inside.”

Eli grinned at me over his shoulder. He had that look he always got when he thought he was about to be the first person to discover something. Not the “I found twenty bucks in a jacket pocket” kind of discovery.

The other kind.

The dumb kind.

“I brought spares,” he said, and patted his cargo pocket. “Relax.”

I wasn’t relaxed. My skin had been buzzing since we turned off the main road and took the gravel service lane that didn’t show up on maps anymore. The trees were too close. The air smelled like wet metal. And the building ahead—half-collapsed, windows punched out, roofline sagging—looked less like “abandoned” and more like “left behind in a hurry.”

It used to be a county property office. That’s what Eli said. Some kind of admin building back when the lake area had more staff, more tourists, more money.

Then there were disappearances.

Not one. Not a “local tragedy” people talk about for a week.

More like a slow leak.

A kid who didn’t come home. A hiker whose truck sat at a trailhead for three days. A maintenance guy who walked in for a shift and never walked back out.

Stuff people argued about online. Stuff adults shrugged off with they probably ran away or they probably got lost.

Eli didn’t shrug. He collected it.

He had a folder on his phone called “SKINNED MAN” like it was a school project.

“You’re really doing the Skinned Man thing right now,” I said, and tried to sound like I thought it was stupid.

Eli’s grin widened. “You say it like it’s not the coolest thing in the world.”

“It’s not,” I said. “It’s a creepypasta.”

“It’s not a creepypasta,” he shot back, immediate. Like he’d been waiting for me to say that. “People have actually gone missing. You’ve seen the posters. You’ve seen the candle vigil posts. That’s not made up.”

I glanced at the gate. Someone had zip-tied a strip of cardboard to the fence. The marker was washed out by rain, but you could still read it:

KEEP OUT — UNSAFE STRUCTURE

Underneath that, someone had written, in a different hand:

HE’S IN THERE

Eli shined his flashlight across it like he was reading an exhibit label.

“There,” he said, triumphant. “See? Even locals know.”

“Or locals want teenagers to stop trespassing,” I said.

Eli moved closer to the gate and lifted the chain where it had been cut and tied off. “We’re not going deep. We go in, we get some footage, we leave. That’s it.”

He said “footage” like this was a documentary and not two idiots with cheap flashlights and a phone on ten percent.

I hesitated.

I could’ve turned around right then. I could’ve told him to screw off and gone home and played games and pretended the world was normal.

But I’d already followed him here. And the thing about Eli was, if you backed out, he’d do it anyway. Alone. He’d go in, he’d get hurt, and then I’d live with that.

So I stepped over the cut chain and followed him through.

The weeds were taller on the inside, like the lot had been growing wild for a decade. Broken glass crunched under our shoes. A metal sign that probably used to have the county seal on it lay face-down in the dirt.

Eli pointed his flashlight at the front doors.

The glass was gone. The double doors hung open like a mouth.

Inside was dark.

Even with our lights, it felt dark.

You know how some places feel like they still have air moving through them? Like they’re just empty buildings?

This didn’t.

This felt… packed. Like the darkness was a thing in there, waiting to be disturbed.

“Last chance,” I muttered.

Eli looked back. “You’re already here.”

And then he stepped inside like it was a dare.

The lobby smelled like mildew and old paper. The ceiling tiles were missing in places, exposing metal ribs and dangling wires. A receptionist desk sat flipped on its side like someone had shoved it over in anger.

Eli moved slow, flashlight beam scanning the floor.

“Watch your step,” he said, and his voice had that weird excited calm. Like he was trying to prove he wasn’t scared.

We walked past a hallway with doors on both sides. Some were open. Most were shut. The building made small noises—settling creaks, a distant drip—stuff that should’ve been normal.

But every time something creaked, Eli flinched. He tried to hide it, but I saw.

“Okay,” I said quietly. “Explain the Skinned Man thing again, because you never do it straight.”

Eli held up his phone, screen dim, and pulled up a saved post. “Old accounts say he used to work maintenance here,” he said. “Like, back when it was staffed. And then he disappeared. And then people started going missing around the area. And some hikers—supposedly—found…” He swallowed, and the beam on his flashlight jittered. “Found a deer with the skin peeled off like a jacket.”

“Eli.”

“I’m just saying what the thread said.”

“Threads say aliens built the pyramids,” I said.

Eli shot me a look. “This is different.”

“Because it scares you.”

“Because it’s real,” he insisted.

We passed an office with a busted window. Moonlight fell in a pale rectangle across the floor. Dust hung in the beam like floating ash.

And then I saw it.

A face.

Not a person. Not a full body.

Just… a face shape in the darkness of the room, pale against the back wall. Like someone standing still, watching us through a doorway.

My whole body went cold.

I stopped so hard Eli bumped into me.

“What—”

“Shh,” I hissed, and nodded toward the room.

Eli followed my gaze. His flashlight swept across.

The “face” vanished.

Not like it moved.

Like it was never there.

Just a peeled patch of wallpaper, lighter than the rest, curling at the edges like a thin flap.

Eli exhaled in this shaky laugh that wasn’t funny. “Dude. You’re jumpy.”

“I saw something,” I said.

“You saw wallpaper.”

I didn’t argue. I just kept moving, because standing still in that hallway felt wrong. Like the building wanted us to pause.

We took a left, deeper into the place. Eli kept filming little clips, whispering commentary like he was hosting a ghost show.

“Room one… old offices… ceiling collapse… super creepy…”

I wanted to tell him to shut up, but the sound of his voice was the only thing keeping the silence from swallowing us.

That’s what I told myself, anyway.

We passed a stairwell blocked by fallen drywall and twisted railings. The lower floor was half flooded, black water reflecting our lights in quick flashes.

“Basement’s a no,” I said.

Eli nodded too fast. “Yeah. No. Not trying to die.”

We kept going until we found a small office with intact walls and a door that still swung on its hinges. It had an old corkboard on one wall and a metal filing cabinet rusted at the corners. The window was cracked but not fully broken.

It felt like a pocket of normal.

Eli shut the door behind us and leaned back against it with a dramatic sigh. “Okay,” he said. “Break.”

I slid my backpack off and pulled out two water bottles. My hands were shaking a little, and that annoyed me.

“You good?” Eli asked, trying to sound casual.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just… this place sucks.”

He took the bottle and twisted the cap. “This place rules.”

I stared at him. “You’re insane.”

Eli smiled, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Okay, listen,” he said, voice dropping like he was about to confess something. “I didn’t just want to see if it was true.”

“Here it comes.”

He glanced down at his phone, screen reflecting in his eyes. “My cousin’s friend disappeared last fall,” he said. “Near the lake trail. Everybody acted like it was normal. Like… ‘oh, people go missing sometimes.’ But they didn’t find anything. Not even a backpack.”

I didn’t say anything.

Eli kept going anyway, like he’d been holding it in.

“I found these posts,” he said. “People saying the same thing happened years ago. Same area. Same… nothing. And then someone mentioned this building. Like it’s connected. Like this is where it started.”

I swallowed. “Eli, you know that’s how rumors work.”

“Then why are there clothes everywhere?” he shot back. “Why is that a thing multiple people report? Clothes. Left behind. Like someone—like something—just—” He made a grabbing motion. “—takes them.”

I opened my mouth to tell him to stop, because my brain didn’t want the picture.

That’s when Eli went quiet mid-sentence.

His face changed.

Not fear exactly.

Confusion first. Like he suddenly didn’t understand what he was seeing.

“What?” I asked, and followed his gaze down toward the floor behind the desk.

My flashlight beam dropped.

And my stomach dropped with it.

There was blood.

Not a little smear. Not a “someone cut their hand years ago” stain.

Dark, wet-looking patches on the carpet, tacky at the edges. A trail leading behind the desk.

And slumped in the corner, half in shadow, half in our light—

A body.

At first my brain tried to make it something else. A mannequin. A pile of dirty clothes.

Then the shape resolved.

Human. Arms. Legs. Head tilted wrong.

And the worst part wasn’t that it was dead.

It was that it was… peeled.

Like someone had taken a person and removed the outside like it was an outfit.

There wasn’t skin on the arms. There wasn’t skin on the face. The muscles beneath looked dark and glossy, like raw meat left out too long.

Eli made a sound that was pure animal—no words, just a strangled inhale.

I backed up until my shoulders hit the door.

“What the—” I started, but my mouth couldn’t finish. My tongue didn’t want to name it.

Eli’s flashlight shook so hard the beam jittered across the body, across the blood, across the wall.

Then we heard it.

A scream.

Not outside the building.

Inside it.

Somewhere down the hallway, deeper, like it was coming from behind walls.

A woman again. The same kind of scream as before—pain, not surprise. A long, raw sound that kept going like whoever was making it wasn’t allowed to stop.

Eli clapped a hand over his mouth.

I whispered, “We have to go. Now.”

Eli didn’t move.

He was staring at the body like his brain was still trying to turn it into something else.

“Eli!” I hissed.

The scream cut off.

Abrupt. Like someone yanked a cord.

And in the silence that followed, we heard something else.

Footsteps.

Not loud. Not stomping.

Soft, deliberate steps in the hallway outside the office door.

Eli’s eyes snapped to mine.

We didn’t breathe.

The doorknob turned.

Slow.

The door didn’t open, because Eli had shut it, but the knob kept turning like whoever was outside was testing it.

Then the knob stopped.

A pause.

And a voice, close enough that it felt like it was inside my ear, whispered through the crack:

“Eli…”

Eli’s face went paper-white.

He whispered back without thinking, “How—”

I grabbed his arm so hard he flinched. “Don’t,” I mouthed.

The voice outside shifted. Like it was trying the sound again.

“Eli,” it repeated, and this time it sounded more like him. The same lazy tone he used when he said my name. Same rhythm. Like a recording played back wrong.

The doorknob turned again.

Harder.

The door rattled.

Eli panicked. He lunged for the desk drawer like he was looking for a weapon, anything.

The drawer slid open with a squeal, and in that split second of noise, the door stopped rattling.

Silence.

Then—

A thump against the wood.

Not a kick.

Something heavier. Like a shoulder. Or a head.

Eli whispered, “We’re not alone.”

No kidding.

I found a letter opener in the drawer—rusted, dull, barely a blade—but I took it anyway because holding something felt better than holding nothing.

The door shuddered again.

Another thump, harder.

A crack formed along the edge of the frame where the wood was weak from rot.

Eli backed into the wall, eyes wide.

I raised the letter opener like it mattered.

The voice outside whispered again, and this time it wasn’t Eli’s voice or a woman’s voice.

It was wrong.

Wet.

Like speech made with a throat that didn’t fit.

“Open.”

The door slammed inward.

The frame splintered. The lock snapped. The door flew open and bounced off the wall.

And it stepped in.

The Skinned Man wasn’t a man the way you picture one.

It was shaped like one, sure—two arms, two legs, head on a neck—but everything looked like it had been built out of something else.

No skin. No hair. No features that made it human.

Its body was glossy and dark and ridged in places, like exposed muscle and sinew stretched too tight over bone. The hands were too long, fingers ending in pale, sharp nails that looked more like hooked shards.

Its face—

I don’t even know how to describe it without making it sound fake.

It had no lips. No eyelids. Its teeth were visible all the time, not because it was smiling, but because there was nothing to cover them. Its eyes were open, dry, fixed on us like two dead marbles set too deep.

And it smelled like copper and rot. Like an open wound left in the sun.

Eli made a noise and bolted.

“Eli—!” I shouted, but he was already pushing past the desk, sprinting into the hallway.

The thing moved so fast my brain couldn’t track it.

One second it was in the doorway, the next it was halfway across the room, head snapping toward Eli like it could hear his heartbeat.

It lunged.

I swung the letter opener without thinking, more panic than plan. The blade hit its arm and slid off with a squeal like metal on wet stone.

The Skinned Man didn’t react like it felt pain.

It reacted like it noticed me.

Its head turned slowly toward me.

Its eyes locked on mine.

And I swear—this is the part that makes me feel insane—the expression on its face didn’t change, because it didn’t have one, but something about the way it looked at me felt like recognition. Like it was deciding what to do with me.

Then it moved past me.

Not around me. Past me, close enough that its shoulder brushed mine.

And it clawed my side as it went.

Three long rakes across my ribs, through my hoodie, through my shirt, hot and immediate. I felt the fabric tear. I felt skin pull. I felt warmth spill.

I staggered back and hit the wall hard enough to see stars.

Eli screamed from the hallway.

Not a long scream. A short one, cut off like someone squeezed it out of him.

I shoved myself forward anyway, clutching my side. My fingers came away slick.

“Eli!” I yelled, and my voice cracked.

The hallway was a tunnel of darkness and dust. Eli’s flashlight beam bounced wildly ahead, then dropped, spinning, casting crazy circles on the ceiling.

I limped after it, breathing hard, pain stabbing every time my ribs moved.

Around the corner, I saw them.

Eli on the floor, scrambling backward on his hands like he couldn’t get his legs under him. His phone was somewhere beside him, still recording, screen flashing as it tried to focus.

The Skinned Man stood over him.

Eli sobbed, “I’m sorry— I’m sorry—”

The Skinned Man reached down with one hand and grabbed Eli by the shoulder.

Not roughly.

Almost gently.

Then it pulled.

Eli’s scream turned into something I’ll never forget. Not because it was loud, but because it sounded like his whole body was trying to get away from itself.

I tried to move faster and almost collapsed.

The Skinned Man’s head turned toward me again, like it was checking.

Then, with a quick motion that was too practiced, it yanked.

And Eli’s voice cut off.

The hallway went quiet except for my own ragged breathing and the tiny clicking sound of Eli’s phone still trying to record in the dust.

I stared at the thing and my brain refused to accept what I’d just seen.

Eli’s body slumped, limp, wrong.

The Skinned Man lifted something in its hand.

Not a weapon.

A sheet.

Skin.

I gagged.

The Skinned Man turned slightly, as if admiring it, then tossed it over its arm like a jacket.

It took one step toward me.

I snapped back into my body.

I ran.

I don’t remember choosing direction. I just ran.

Down the hallway, past the lobby, out through the broken doors into the weeds, into the open air that felt like a lie because the darkness outside wasn’t safe either.

My side burned. Every breath was a knife. The world narrowed to the sound of my own feet and the wet slap of blood against fabric.

Behind me, I heard it.

Not footsteps.

A soft scraping, like nails on concrete.

Then a voice, distant but clear, using Eli’s voice now like it was a trick it wanted to show off.

“Dude— wait!”

I almost looked back.

Almost.

Instead I ran harder, crying without meaning to, because my body had no other way to dump the fear.

I crashed through the fence line where the chain had been cut. I hit the gravel service lane and kept going, stumbling, lungs on fire.

My car was parked farther up by the turnoff, and I don’t know how I made it there without passing out.

I tore the door open, fell into the driver’s seat, and locked it so hard my finger slipped off the button.

Then I sat there, shaking, staring at the abandoned building through the windshield.

For a long time, nothing moved.

No shape in the doorway. No silhouette in the windows.

Just the building, dark and empty, like it hadn’t just eaten my best friend.

My phone was on the passenger seat. I grabbed it with shaking hands and called 911.

The call went through.

A dispatcher answered.

I couldn’t make words at first. I just breathed into the phone like I was drowning.

Then I forced it out, stuttering, messy.

“There’s— there’s someone— in there— my friend— he—”

I looked back at the building again, trying to keep my eyes on something real.

And that’s when I saw a face in the second-floor window.

Not wallpaper.

Not peeled paint.

A face.

Pressed close to the glass.

Smooth. Featureless in the dark except for the suggestion of eyes, the hint of teeth, the idea of a mouth that didn’t need lips.

It stared at me without moving.

And in my head—not in the phone, not in the car, not in the air—I heard Eli’s voice, perfectly, like he was leaning in from the back seat.

“Tell them to come inside.”

I slammed the car into drive and left so hard gravel spit out behind my tires like sparks.

I didn’t stop until I hit the first main road with streetlights and other cars.

I pulled into a gas station and stumbled into the bathroom and lifted my shirt.

The claw marks across my ribs were deep. Not fatal, but deep enough that the skin around them had already started to swell, angry and red. Three long lines like a signature.

I cleaned them the best I could and wrapped them in paper towels and tape because that’s what you do when you’re seventeen and bleeding and trying not to fall apart in front of strangers.

When the cops finally found me, I told them everything.

They went to the building.

They found the office.

They found blood.

They did not find Eli.

They did not find a body.

They told me maybe it was a prank gone wrong. Maybe my friend ran and I panicked. Maybe I got cut on broken glass.

They said it with that careful tone adults use when they want you to feel stupid without calling you stupid.

A week later, I got a message from an unknown number.

No text. Just a video.

I didn’t want to click it.

I did anyway.

It was shaky footage from inside that office—the one with the corkboard and the filing cabinet.

Eli’s phone footage.

The video froze right before the Skinned Man stepped into frame.

Then, slowly, the camera shifted on its own, like someone picked up the phone and pointed it.

Straight into the lens.

A face filled the screen.

No skin. No eyelids. Teeth showing.

And Eli’s voice, perfect and close, whispered:

“Come back. We’re not done.”
