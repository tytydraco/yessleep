Brown noise from a speaker. Earbud playing The Office. Doors and windows closed. Blinds shut. A night light low enough to reach under the bed. Five pillows. Thirty minutes of relaxation reading.

I am ready to sleep.

My brain complains. It shoots thought after thought as cannonballs from a British Navy ship. I’m hit. I am a pirate navigating the sea now. I try to fire back but my crew deserted me. It is me against my thoughts.

I focus on Meredith fighting a bat on her hair. A fortuitous gust of wind thrusts me where my thoughts can’t reach me. I still need to dodge the giant tentacles of the anxiety kraken waiting for me. Taunting me.

Morpheus island is on sight, but to get there, I’ll need to go through the monster.

I make a tight left, the wooden wheel creaks but doesn’t break. One tentacle surrounds the ship, one embraces me. My soul is filled with dread for what’s to come. My clothes are drenched with sweat. My mind threatens to shut down in panic, terrified of what the future holds.

Seizing the last moment of clarity before falling down the bottomless whirlpool of worry and nervousness, I pull out my musket. My heart rate is racing. My muscles are so tight that I can barely move my arm. Using strength I don’t have, I charge, point and shoot.

The Kraken jerks but doesn’t release. I unsheath my scimitar. It slices the thick, slimy, sucker-filled flesh as if it was made of butter. A purple, viscous liquid covers my face and mixes with the sweat running down my temple. The kraken lets out the loudest screech before retreating to the depths of my unconscious.

My ship crashes against the white sands of Morpheus arms. 

I am asleep.

Then I hear the scratching. 

It is a deep sound that repeats over and over and over again. Each time louder. Each time longer.

I give it one, two, three minutes. Anything not to abandon my cocoon. But it doesn’t stop. It pounds in my head over the brown noise, over Dwight, through the closed door, directly into my brain.

I am awake.

I stand up and follow the noise. The cat follows me. It comes from the outside. For a moment it stops and I consider going back to bed, but it comes back with a vengeance.

I open the door and step into the hallway of my ground floor apartment. The floor vibrates with the scratches. I swear each scratch sounds closer than the one before. Is that… is that breath that I hear under the floorboard? 

The time is uncertain. We are at that point in the night when clocks don’t matter and it is so dark out that it is easy to believe that the sun is dead. I knock on my neighbors’ door anyway, almost wishing they didn’t hear anything. Insanity is almost a better option than what lies beneath.

They are also awake. They hear it. They don’t care.

I don’t mention the panting, or the muffled growling. There is no point.

When they closed the door I can spy a smile and a whisper in one of them. The other one throws me a last glance before their faces are lost forever, back in a world that is as foreign to me as the stars in the sky.

The scratches are now directly under me. Is that hissing? I jump back inside my apartment and shut the door. Every single lock.

911? Don’t be silly. You are a grown man. They’ll laugh at you, like the neighbors. Like everyone else. The scratching followed me home. The vibration continues. The cat hears it too, I can tell. I want to run to the kitchen, but I walk. I am a grown man. I turn on every light on my way there.

Silence. Finally.

I take some cold fried chicken and coleslaw from the fridge and sit at the kitchen table. I eat with fake enthusiasm. The food tastes like fear.

The cat notices it first. She jumps to the kitchen counter, back arched, fur standing tall, eyes glued to the floor.

The scratching resumed, and the growling, and the panting, and the sniffing. All at the same time.

I am a grown man, so I call the non-emergency police line and casually explain what is happening. The words monster, life-threatening, or help never leave my mouth.

Even without them, I can’t help but recognize the patronizing tone of the police officer. If I was a toddler that didn’t check for pedestrians before riding a bike, I would have gotten the exact same treatment. It takes me all two minutes to know that the police, as bored as they are, won’t entertain a visit. 

As a last resort, I put my phone against the floor and let the scratches do the talking.

“Call animal control in the morning. You are safe, trust me,” is all I get.

“Good night,” I say instead of “No, I am fucking not, you idiot!” Then I hang up.

The scratches, I swear, are just below the bamboo flooring now. Now, they aren’t, I say to myself.

The cat runs to the bedroom. My cocoon, of course, that’s where I must go. There is carpet there. Somehow, my brain feels confident that carpet will be stronger than wood and concrete.

I turn on the volume of the brown noise to the max. I turn on the light. I put on my noise cancelling headphones. I write all that has happened so far, just as my therapist suggested.

And I wait.

And wait.

And wait.

The sun finally decides to show up. I am cranky, after all, I couldn’t sleep all night. I was right though, the carpet worked. No scratches in my cocoon. 

With the sun up, I dare to remove my headphones. I dare to pause the brown noise. Silence. Total silence. Good news.

I go to the door and the cat goes the other way, to the furthest corner of the room. The handle is warm to the touch, I realize why too late. The door is already open and I am falling in a pit. I grab the handle with the strength desperation brings and can gain enough momentum to bounce back. All is red and fire and deep and vast outside. My room is in a pit of lava. I look down. I shouldn’t have.

The hissing, the panting, the growling comes to me in the form of a black, horned creature with a thousand teeth and a million claws. I close the door and put my back against it. A silly move, in hindsight.

The creature bumps against the door and I am thrown across the room, landing by my cat. My cat looks at me with the best version of “I told you so” eyes that have ever existed.

I know.

After I gather enough courage, I peek from a corner of the window, lifting the bling ever so slightly.

It is all the pit. My bedroom is in a pit of fire. Everything is red, and hot, and full of teeth and claws.

With the calm that only hopeless circumstances can give you, I come back to my bed and continue writing.

I will give a call to the police in a few minutes, whenever I can come up with a good reason for them to come instead of sending a mental institution van.

In the meantime, I resume the brown noise and put back my headphones.

As the theme of The Office starts, I hear a subtle scratch under the bed and, is that a hissing?

I turn on the volume and close my eyes. I am back in my cocoon.

But I am not alone.
