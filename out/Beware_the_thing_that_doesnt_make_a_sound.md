It never made a sound as I watched it along the tree line. The sun had all but set and the Fall leaves of Northern BC began to lose their golden glow. Already, they began to shrink next to their large, verdant counterparts - trimmed with countless, hardy needles that wouldn’t shake free all winter, even with the harsh teething winds that blow over the lakes and plains. 

The leaves shuffled amongst themselves, and the thing’s hair and clothes tumbled and whipped in the wind, yet it made no effort to get warm or move into the trees. It simply stood, and for all intents and purposes, stared. I was on my way home from a hunt and the clearing I found myself in was the straightest line to the old logging road where I had left my truck. With no game in tow to raise my spirits, the rifle on my shoulder hung heavy and the evening felt colder than the dropping -2°C normally would.

I had gotten near halfway through the clearing, less than a kilometer across in any direction, with a small lake taking up a third of the browning sward. 

That’s when I noticed ‘it.’ 

I realize I’ve been saying ‘it,’ and in truth, I couldn’t tell you why. What stood at the tree line no more than 500 metres away had the appearance of a woman. It had dark hair that looked black but was most likely a deep August brown, tumbling straight down from its crown. Strands obscured its pale face and draped on the white, collared gown that covered most of its body, looking like drips of oil. At a distance, I could only guess at the height, but it looked to be just under 6 feet when compared to the thin trunks behind. 

Yet this apparition, with its features of a young woman in a white dress with dark, tousled hair, was anything but human. As I stared on and focused my gaze in the dimming Autumnal light, I didn’t feel like I was looking at a person. It felt like I was looking at an animal. 

It took a minute to register, after I first noticed it. But once I saw its uncovered feet and rippling skirt, the hair raised on every inch of my body - like the moment you realize you’re being stalked. Mountain lions are prevalent here and in most cases you’ll never see them. But they’ll see you - following you, in the shadows and in the blurry part of your eye.

This felt the same. 

It occurred to me then that something may have been hunting me as I stalked wild game in the wilderness, and the only reason a predator would reveal itself before the kill is when it knows its prey can’t escape. When it’s already as good as dead.

The rifle was still holstered at my side, but my trembling fingertips discreetly moved for the stock, hoping I could get a shot off before it was too late. What frightened me most was the lack of evidence to substantiate my primal intuition on the matter - the thing would have no trouble clearing the field before I could ready my gun.

And there I was, caught mid-stride and locked in unbreaking eye contact with this thing on the tree line. And through it all, it made no sound.

Any real person that looked like that should be screaming their head off for help, yet this being did no such thing. When it finally moved, I flinched and slipped the strap from my shoulder and started to ready the chamber. Never have I had to cock my bolt action so quickly, and yet when I looked down my sights it was still in the same place. 

It was waving now — no, beckoning?

Like a tree branch swaying in the breeze, it motioned forward and then back, as if casting a fishing line and attempting to reel me in. My body went cold from the inside out, yet it was no Northern wind that was cutting through me. It was that feeling again. 

The feeling that I was about to die. 

Through my scope, some of its features were a bit clearer; the dirt on its hands, feet, and clothes. The rips and tears on the hem of its gown. I tried to look at its face, yet the dark tendrils kept sweeping across, hugging its mouth like someone being suffocated by a plastic bag. 

Then, for a moment, I could see it. The face was long and gaunt, with lips that looked almost blue in the cold. Its eyes were dark, probably brown but they looked black in the dusk. The little light that was left of the day did not twinkle in the deep irises nestled in white. There was no life there. 

It was a look that I had only seen once before. My late brother, in the throes of death, following a long battle with addiction - in the end there was no hope there. It became clear there was no hope for me here, either.

A gust of polar air slipped through the clearing, watering my eyes as it blowed against my exposed nose and shook the trees around. I blinked it out and wiped my tears before refocusing my scope. 

As I stabilized my sights, my stomach fell. 

Its hair had moved out of the way and I could see it properly for the first time. It still made no sound, but now I could see why. Dark, purple bruises encircled its throat, like an intricate necklace made of burst blood vessels. It stretched around the entirety of the neck, splitting off like capillaries into thinner markings, like a handprint made out of twigs, crushing the esophagus.

Its jaw was moving, almost unhinging itself from effort as the mouth opened and closed. But it wasn’t stretching its bite - it was trying to say something. No — it was trying to scream something. 

“Behind you.”

Then, the distinct, sharp crack of wood sounded from behind me.

I was right. That thing in front of me wasn’t a human - but it had been at some point earlier that day. Now it was a hopeless, pitiable thing one step away from a corpse - daring not to take the final step into the beyond. Using its last amount of strength to communicate one thing to me.

That I would be next.

I still had its face in my scope, and could see that there was no helping this thing. It knew this too.

In that moment where things were still and tears ran down its filthy face, I filled my lungs with air and broke into a sprint before I even made the decision. More twigs - no, branches - cracked on my left in the tree line opposite to the ghastly figure. I heaved each foot over the other, brushing through the dying grass, the only other sound was my uneven breath. 

My muddy, red Dodge was sitting where I left it, alone on this forgotten old road. Relief washed over me as my key was still securely latched to the lanyard in my pocket and I opened the cab door with ease. Only after I was inside and had the engine running did I look back at the clearing. There was nothing there. No ghost, cougar, nor unspeakable third option.

As I trundled down the road as fast as I could manage without rolling the vehicle did it occur to me that the thing in the clearing may not have been ‘human’ anymore, but there was a time it was alive, a woman, a victim - my saviour. The breath I had left in me sat tight in my chest as I said a wordless prayer over her memory and followed it with a promise to never come back to this place, blocked off by boulders, several kilometers off the highway. No one ever could tell me the reason the logging road had been decommissioned, though I have my suspicions now.

It’s been six years since then and I’ve not picked up my gun or ever considered retracing my steps. I never found out what it was that she was warning me about that night, but one thing was clear.

I never would have seen it coming. Not until it was too late.

It never made a sound.
