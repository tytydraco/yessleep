 

I traveled up the unnamed road past the pharmacy, crossed the narrow intersection, entered the restaurant on the left, and asked the patron of the bar to buy 99 bottles. I had to wait for a while at a table while the bar cleared out for closing, which is at 1:13 a.m. exactly. Before sending me here, my mother in law said she preferred to arrive at this particular shop after evening had died and the new moon had risen, giving no light to splay across cobblestone streets, and providing  no guidance through the town besides murky outlines of architecture. After the last customer had walked -or stumbled- out, I followed the bar owner to the middle of the place. He  kneeled and made a gesture over the floor, then pulled a lever which split the tile and revealed a rickety and untrustworthy-looking ladder, in a way resembling an upside-down attic entrance instead of a staircase. He reached into a pocket that seemed infinitely deep and retrieved a matchbox and a long, slim dark blue candle. He lit it and descended. I followed them down. Her words echoed in my head as I descended: *Forget what you knew above.*

*Forget morality. Learn your desire. Don’t talk*. The keeper prefers silence according to her, and the silence is audible in their shop. You won’t hear the expected hum of the occasional automobile driving on the road overhead. No typical welcoming into the establishment and a clink of wares from a backroom before the keeper emerges to greet you. The closest thing to the motion of a hand beckoning me inside was the waving flame of a candle held by my guide. My footsteps were so silent on the polished floor that I wondered if the keeper had sucked the sound from my soles through the hardwood. I thought I forgot to inhale and exhale, with the only sign of respiratory action being the breath I could feel, not hear.  I was ushered to the counter that had an old-fashioned rotary telephone neatly set up. There was no keeper I could see. Was the keeper next to me? A growing panic obstructed my time to think.

She told me to ignore the fact the walls are bare except for five jars of a dark liquid. To ignore the bartender’s tightening grip on your arm as you begin to regret your decision to come here. That’s part of the process, she said, she insisted. When she went, that was all part of the process. The phone rings, and the noise is both jarring and relieving. Their hand loosens and you pick it up. Others want what you do, you learn. They’re all on phones of their own. The wishing begins in 10 seconds. Check your phone, it doesn’t work here. Neither does your watch. I tried to keep time, skipping from 10 to 7 to compensate for the lost seconds. The owner waves his free hand towards the phone, which rings loudly. The second I lift it from the receiver, the dial tone sounds. Immediately I received a text from my brother. The cancer stopped. He’s stable. Two weeks have turned into two decades. 

A gasp of joy and disbelief is replaced with a gurgling cry as my throat is grabbed by a disembodied hand. The force begins to thrash haphazardly, like it’s shaking a tambourine. Strangely, the moment I’m touched, I see all of this in third person, from eyes on the low concrete ceiling. I see myself dying from above.  The hand and the owner ignore my pleas and sobs for help until the words are replaced by the gurgling of blood rushing up and dripping down a wound that resembles a second mouth. The jars on the shelf tremble as the blood ignores physics and flows towards a drain behind the counter instead of pooling in front of your slowly stiffening corpse. The already-dim room flickers.  *Someone smarter must’ve wished they were alone in using their power.* The blood is gone, the owner silently adjusts jars. *How many came  before, how many will come after?* The faint sound of another pair of footsteps coming down the stairs in irregular, staccato intervals.  *I wonder what she wished for*. I think my last thought as the dim becomes a black, and the night takes me in. 

Gold lit into black. Hands on rough stone, a road? Earthen walls, buildings. She’s standing above me, smiling. Dawn. Leans, caresses my forehead. “I called to get you”, she says.
