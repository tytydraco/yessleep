I’ve worked there for 48 days and I wouldn’t come back for a million dollars. There being a mid level local retail insurance agency, I guess that’s what it’s called. I don’t actually work there, I work at an admin/secretarial temp agency. For those unfamiliar, that's a company that supplies a worker for a business when they have an open position and they can’t find a replacement in time. Ours specifically is for administration and basic entry level office work. Usually the situation is that a pissed off worker leaves in a hurry. Often giving their notice with a middle finger as they walk out the door. That’s like 9 times out of 10. This was 10.   
  
This time they died. He apparently was driving home at a reasonable 4am when the nearly fifth of vodka in his gut decided to guide his Toyota into a wall. I don’t mean to be callous, but my modus operandi is to take an extremely neutral and uninvolved position in the workplaces I enter. That’s because I’m often stepping into, or even literally sitting in the hot seat of, a lot of drama. It’s illogical, but it’s only human nature that when people are PO’ed at the person I’m replacing then see me sitting at their desk, doing their duties, I become asshole-defacto in their eyes. So, as a rule- I come in, do my own thing, don’t get involved, ‘No, Michael (you gossip, you) I don’t want to hear what they compared the manager to as they walked out’. And after about usually two weeks when management has had time to work through their replacements- I leave. It’s kind of like a more benign version of Bugs Life “They come. They eat. They leave”, except substitute ‘eating’ for ‘working’.   
  
In this case, yes I did break my rules a little bit. Surprising or not this is the first time in my 8 years at the agency that I’ve replaced a dead person. So my interest was piqued when I learned that he had died. And it grew when I noticed how unusually ungossipy the whole office was being. So I bit. I wanted more details. Maybe that was my mistake. I decided to casually investigate around the office. Strangely, there were few words for the departed and the ones offered were stiff and obligatory. I was getting ready to give up on my quest despite my interest being at its peak, due to a lack of information and it seeming apathetic to pry any more. But in my last conversation by the water cooler before I abandoned it all, it would be Miriam who rose to the occasion.   
  
She didn’t give me much but she said “Let’s just say you’re not going to hear a lot of people lamenting the passing. I know that’s awful to say, but I’m old so I can say it. Most people are probably grappling with feeling guilty with the relief they felt when they learned he died. That and being grateful not to smell his awful cologne again.” The ‘cologne’ comment got a grunting agreement from a couple others. The details offered were few, but it suffices to say that from what I heard is he was a horror to be around.   
  
After that I started to do the job that I was here for. I also figured as they got to know me they might trust me with a little more information. But if I didn’t hear any more I was somewhat content knowing the basics of it. So I went about my day.   
  
Early in this career I learned that the kitchen and breakroom situation can be sensitive and a bit of a minefield for my temporary stay. So I always bring my own snacks and tea. The only thing I needed was hot water from the red spout at the water cooler. Currently, I’m in a bit of an Earl Grey kick right now but we’ll see.   
  
The admin stuff had a bit of catching up to do and it didn’t help that the computer and software system I was using was full of bugs. Mostly it’s just little stuff like the mouse makes a selection when I’m not directly holding it which often does nothing and at worst is when the cursor was over an ad but that's still just annoying at most. Also I find that if the keyboard is left alone for a while it tends to just randomly add characters, this is just an inconvenience, a little entertaining honestly. But I think a lot of what contributes to this is that the desk is across from the automatic sliding door and every time it opens a gust of frigid dusty February air blows in and I imagine it gets into the keyboard and mouse. But this was about as cumbersome as this job initially appeared to be.   
  
The next week continued much in the same way as this one had. Usually my tenure at a place is only a few weeks anyways so I was planning on just fording through these minor technical problems but they got progressively worse. The main one being the keyboard starting dropping in random letters even as I was typing. I would be moving full speed as random letters would be added in here and there. As you might imagine I didn’t even realize at first, I thought that I must have just hit a key by accident here and there, but no as it increased in frequency I also paid attention to where the keys were that I was pressing and the letters that were being added and more often than not they weren't even adjacent keys.   
  
I don’t like to ask for things during these jobs, I’d rather come in and leave quietly without making any disruptions. But this keyboard issue was getting so annoying that I decided to look around and I found a number of empty cubicles… with identical keyboards. I know, is it more adult and professional to just ask for a new keyboard? -Obviously. But this meant I didn’t have to feel like a problem or get in anyone's way. So I swapped them out. Lo and behold it went away and it was back to work as usual, at least briefly.  
  
That’s when the smell started. Ugh, god I hate that smell. It started light at first but would seem to gain in boldness everyday. It has an extremely animalistic and like mildew smell, not unlike the park’s public bathroom that’s definitely a home to a few critters. It’s not so strong as to be an immediate problem, it's just the extended exposure to it that makes it so unbearable. Which is strange because for most of us I would say it normally goes the other direction; that a smell might be bad at first but you get used to it as time goes on. This weirdly has the opposite effect on me. Its intensity builds painfully strong as the day goes on. Unfortunately it seems to be contained to the front lobby as no one else notices it anywhere else in the office.  I tried lighting some Fall Spice candles that I found in the back of the supply closet but that didn’t help much.   
  
It’s hard to really express through written word the nature of a smell. It’s repugnant in a way that creates a deeply internal reaction that I didn’t even know I could feel. At a certain point in the day, and it’s getting earlier and earlier, I can’t even manage to stay there any longer and I take a walking trip to the employee lounge area or even the bathroom. Which is wild to say, but the bathroom is actually an appreciated breath of fresh air compared to my desk.   
  
Which all in all is frustrating, but then it got strange. One day we were having a visit from a larger insurance provider and they came in a bit early so I called the boss on the internal line to let her know they had arrived to which she said she would come out in a second to greet them, then I politely asked them to take a seat. I made some lighter conversation; I believe they were from Cincinnati so I asked about the flight and all that. I asked them if they had any recommendations of places to see in Cincinnati if I ever found myself out there. I certainly don’t have any immediate plans to go out there, but it’s sort of a nice plus I found of having a job where you interact with people from all over the place. You get to learn about all the local spots. I write them down in this little teal composition book I have and save them for any travels.   
  
So after I added their little hole in the wall places the boss still hadn’t shown. This was about the time anyways that the smell was getting truly unbearable, so partially just in need of something else to discuss I apologized for the smell. They sort of hesitantly brushed it off. But it was odd. I wasn’t sure why they responded like that and they didn’t elaborate. So I pushed a little further, and said that the smell had started up about a week ago and it was just getting worse every day. One of them said, “Oh it must be the air travel that’s plugging up my sinuses. I didn't notice a thing”. The other seemed to avoid adding to the conversation, which made me more curious. Normally, I would be more than happy to let an awkward conversation die but in that moment the smell felt nearly caustic to my nose, so I asked “Is it bothering you?” He sort of stuttered then said, “I don’t think I really smell- do you mean the candle smell? It’s like cinnamon or something? That smells fine to me”. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I may as well have defecated in my pants for how bad this smelled to me and neither of them could even smell it? Not only that but the second one could distinctly smell the candle through it.   
  
I didn’t really acknowledge it but that’s when a quiet panic started to set in deep down in my chest. Fortunately the boss walked in right then because I was about to ask them to come over to my desk and smell again. The post interaction embarrassment of that might have been worse than the smell. Might have been.   
  
The next day I put a work order in. They arrived later that afternoon. Screw the not causing any inconvenience, I couldn’t take the smell anymore, but there was also something else deeper that was scaring me about all this.. I explained that I wanted the source of the smell to be found and removed or cleaned or whatever was necessary. They looked at me with confused eyes. I had to fight back tears as I repeated that I couldn’t stand the smell anymore and they just glanced at each other. Then they asked where they should look to which I said just follow the smell starting wherever it’s the worst I guess. Now normally I would have been less of a pain, but I desperately needed someone to acknowledge what I was experiencing. Unfortunately they never did. Nor did they find the source of it. And they looked over and over at my behest, while I endured weird glances from my coworkers as they left for lunch and returned seeing the workers continue to take apart the front lobby. It didn’t help when they asked what was going on and I responded something about the smell, to which they would sniff the air then glance at each other and sometimes the workers.   
They never did find anything and I assume the manager talked to my actual manager at the temp agency because I got some questions a couple days later. This is something that would have normally bothered me, to have blemished my near impeccable record. But I didn’t care, not anymore. I’ve taken to spending a lot of time in the employee lounge. Once I was complaining in my exasperation to Miriam that my nose felt like I was inhaling burning dog hair and a fridge of rotten food.   
  
Miriam cocked an eyebrow at me. I looked at her for a bit.  
  
She said, “Or kinda like dog shit in a pool bathroom?”   
  
“Yeah? Exactly like that.”   
  
 “That’s what his damn cologne smelled like.”   
  
Immediately, I took her over to the front and begged her to smell the desk area. I needed to confirm this. It doesn’t make any sense though. But she couldn’t smell a thing.   
  
As I went to sleep that night I couldn’t stop thinking about it. It had to be just a coincidence, after all moldy smells and animal smells are very normal stinky smells that you would find. And a cologne that smells bad you could easily compare to those. And even if other people didn’t smell them it was probably just the increased exposure to them that had made them so apparent to me. That could go both ways too. Maybe his cologne had soaked into that chair and into the carpet and into the room in general. And when I sit on the chair and walk on the carpet I’m knocking it into the air around me. And as I sit there for a while I detect it more and more. It makes sense. But I needed to know whether it was the cologne or not and given that she couldn’t smell it there, and she probably wouldn’t be able to unless she sat at my desk for hours (which I briefly considered asking her to swap desks with me for the day so that she could). I had to find another way.   
  
This led me on a path that I am not proud of, but it had been gnawing at me endlessly and something had to be done. That weekend I went to Target for just some random odds and ends, I think I needed new shampoo or something I can't remember. But when I walked past the fragrance department I froze. I wanted to leave but I knew I had to look. So I began carefully and methodically going through them one by one. I would open up the little lid and give it a smell. I started with the colognes, but after I couldn't find it there I moved to the perfumes- who knows. But still I couldn’t find a smell to match the one that’s been haunting me. That should have been the end of it but it was too late the thought was already ingrained too deep in my head.  
  
I went to every brand of department store in my town. One after another, individually sifting through every single body fragrance they had. In one particularly large fragrance section at Walgreens I was asked to leave, but I just went to the next one less than a mile away. And I began where I left off. I was careful not to miss any so I ended up smelling about a quarter of the ones they had available twice just in case.   
  
But after I had gone to all the stores I could think of (including a particularly awkward stint in a Victoria Secret) I couldn't find it. I decided to return to the first Walgreens because I had noticed that the aisle seemed to be a tad larger than the second one which could just mean more volume of products or perhaps more variety. And I was right, only by about 6 fragrances that weren’t at the second. None of them were the one I was looking for. That’s when a horrific thought hit me. What if this was the case with everywhere I went so far? There’s a half dozen Target’s in my city, a handful of Walmart’s. What if I chose ones with smaller fragrance isles? Up to this point had taken a whole week and the better part of the following weekend too.   
  
You might also think how are you possibly keeping track of which ones are at one store and not another. I realized this too. So I went back to the first stores and I took pictures of everything they offered. Which I should have done before I started testing, which comes to another disastrous question. What if they restocked some since the time I had been before? I asked employees in the area if they knew and generally they had no idea. So I began again. I thought about just doing the ones that I didn’t remember but then I decided no-I’m going to do this right and systematically. So back to the beginning. One by one. This time carefully logging each with a picture in my phone to know for sure.  
  
Another question you might have is after smelling what must be dozens if not hundreds, how can I possibly remember the smell I was looking for? This was not hard. At this point that smell has been carved into my memory. I’m afraid that nothing, not even time will dull that smell from my brain.   
  
This process, as you can imagine, took a lot of time. Store by store, bottle by bottle, I moved my way up and down shelves across aisles. Given how everything is going, maybe I’ll become a fragrance connoisseur or something. But I worked my way through local stores. When they were closed and I wasn’t at work that left me with a lot of time that I couldn't be working on this mission. So I started doing research and I found that there are many fragrances you can order online. Fortunately, you can order testing amounts for free or at least fairly cheaply. I started getting these sent to me so I could continue my search from home late into the night.   
  
But after weeks and hundreds if not thousands of scents I had not tracked it down. I had found what I believe to be parts of it. Sometimes there would be something in a fragrance that felt similar to a part of the one I was searching for. But I didn’t know the individual notes well enough to be able to decipher them and reverse engineer it.   
  
One day I was going into work and I stopped at the gas station to fill up and get a big gulp before I went in. As I was filling up my Big Gulp, a man left the bathroom and walked past me. And I smelled it. The scent. I thought maybe it was coming off of me but no it was so immediate and so intense. I spun around to see that the man was actually an employee of that gas station. He had gone to get himself a cup of coffee. I went over to ask him.   
  
“I’m so sorry you bother you. I just wanted to ask you something” I asked.   
  
“Yes sir, what can I help you with?”  
  
“I noticed your cologne and I was wondering what it was”  
  
He cracked me a proud smile, while I eagerly waited for him to reply.   
  
“You hear that Juanita? He wants to know what cologne I use”  
  
Juanita behind the counter rolled her eyes before she went back to counting out change.   
  
He looked back at me.  
  
“She always complains about it saying I smell like a wet dead dog. But I know it’s good.”   
  
I gritted my teeth as I asked again.  
  
“What scent is it exactly and where did you get it?”  
  
“It’s Umbrioge Pour Homme Maximal. You can only get it online.”   
  
He gave me the website for it and I had one ordered for next day delivery before I was back in my car.   
  
But as I left and the door was closing I heard Juanita say to him, “No way that happened again.”   
  
I had set the delivery to work so I would be able to receive it as soon as it arrived. The moment the bottle was in my hands I walked it straight down the hall towards Miriam. I opened it on the way to give it a quick smell to make sure it was right. The smell was only more concentrated and brutal, it made my skin crawl and a shiver ran down my back. But it was right, I finally had it right.  
  
I extended my arm with the cologne in hand to Miriam and asked her to smell it. She, with a healthy look of concern, accepted it and took in a whiff. I saw her jaw clench and her body fight against a shiver. Then she looked at me with a knowing terror in her eyes. I didn’t even wait for her to say it. I knew.   
  
After all this time I had finally found it and had confirmed my suspicions and fears that I was smelling the cologne left by the man who had died. After it all, I finally succeeded and I think that may have been the greatest mistake of my life.   
  
When I returned to my desk I felt a sense of accomplishment that wasn’t like anything else I’ve ever experienced. It was a magnitude beyond what I’ve felt. There was also a certain sickliness to it that it was wrong to have succeeded but I was too proud. I sat down and placed the cologne bottle in front of me. I grinned at myself, overjoyed at what I had completed, almost giddy. I decided at that moment to leave the cologne bottle there and admire it like a trophy. I sipped at my tea while I basked in its glory. I had done it. I had figured it out. I didn’t even really think about what I had “won” and had I actually figured anything out at all or did I just find more questions. It didn’t matter to me.   
  
A bit later I got up and went to the bathroom. When I rounded the corner on my return as soon as I could see my desk my heart sank: the bottle was missing. Its spot on the desk was bare. I raced to my desk. I could see that it wasn’t on the ground, it hadn’t fallen. I kept the desk clear so there was nowhere to be hidden on top of it. When I got there I pulled the chair back and heard a rattle. The bottle was sitting on my chair. I picked it up and set it back on my desk and looked around. It was obviously some sort of prank but it was so pointless. Also I was gone for such a short amount of time and since I was coming from the front desk to the visitor bathroom adjacent to the lobby no one could have easily seen that I wasn’t at my desk. Unless of course they left through the front. Maybe they left something in their car. That made sense, that worked. I still didn’t know why they would though, for anyone else except for Miriam and I that bottle wouldn’t be anything significant. Ultimately, I had already spent too much time examining what was a simple if not inane prank. I set it back down on top of my desk to resume my adoration.   
  
I took a hearty sip of my tea and immediately spit it out, screaming and gasping as I did. I could see it now in the mug in my hands, bubbling…it was boiling- a roaring boil. I could feel the skin on the inside of my mouth detaching. The taste of iron touched what taste buds remained. Someone ran around the corner to answer my initial scream. I opened my mouth to explain but blood and spit dripped out as well as a couple patches of skin. He gasped himself and ran down a hall (for a first aid kit as it turned out). Now I was riding on the wave of adrenaline that was keeping my mind straight, I watched the water in the mug already half-drank from before my bathroom break, slow its boil and until the bubbling stopped completely, at a speed you would expect if you had just poured boiling water into a mug seconds ago.  In the moments the shock and adrenaline covered up the pain I wondered to myself how that could have possibly happened. Briefly wondering who, but that was pointless as I had no idea how. These questions were abruptly ended as the pain returned. I fought as a wave of unconsciousness hit, but then I thought about how peaceful that sounded instead so I let myself succumb and I fainted.  
  
I unfortunately was only unconscious for less than a minute before I was jostled awake by a paramedic. I would have preferred to have been unconscious until I got to the hospital. Not because of the pain, however excruciating. But because of the sound. As I was carted out laying flat on a stretcher staring up at the ceiling tiles I heard a distinct laugh. It was quiet but not in an under the breath way. It was an unashamed full belly laugh, but like it was coming out at only a tenth of the volume. Still loud enough that I was certain I heard it. Certain enough that as we went out the automatic doors I pulled against the straps of the stretcher to look inside to see if I could see who laughed. I saw a handful of people including Miriam, the manager, and a couple other people I vaguely knew, but they all wore concerned expressions not resembling someone who would have laughed. Until I spotted, behind them in the corner of the room behind my chair at my desk… the tall stout silhouette of a man. With his arms crossed and his head tilted back like he was in a fit of laughter. As the outside sun hit my eyes I could no longer discern that shape, but I was positive of what I saw.   
  
I would go to the hospital for 3rd degree burns in my mouth and throat. In the days that followed ample strips of skin had fallen off the walls of my mouth and down inside my throat. That was three days ago, as of today some parts have hardened and scabbed.  
  
I am currently on a worker’s comp claim as I heal from home. Eating and drinking are logistical nightmares so it’s easier to just stay home and heal. While the insurance company and the agency I temped for don’t buy the story that my tea was magically boiling when I returned it is still recognized that I always got my hot water from the water cooler and therefore I must have refilled it on my way back from the bathroom and forgot. But as no water cooler should be capable of expelling boiling water capable of 3rd degree burns the agency is still found liable and the insurance company is paying the claim on the grounds of a faulty water cooler. I’ve already called- well texted; I can't speak well enough yet- my boss informing him that I’ve quit. I’m not used to being so sedentary, so I’ve used this time to read, catch up on shows, and to type up this story to share online. It’s been nice to have something I can do a little bit every day in my home office. As I do I’ve gained a therapeutic feeling of getting this off my chest and sharing it with the world. But as the days and hours have gone on a sense of dread has increased, even now my hair is standing up on my neck and goosebumps cover my arms, as I face the fact that is the undeniable smell of Umbrioge Pour Homme Maximal. At this moment its pungent rank  scent burns my nostrils with an intensity I’d only experienced when I brought the bottle directly to my nose. I fear now, that I quit my job only too late, and perhaps brought something or someone, home with me. I am afraid. Goodbye.
