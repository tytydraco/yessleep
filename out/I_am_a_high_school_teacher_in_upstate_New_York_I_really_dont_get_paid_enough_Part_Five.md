The Hollow Tap was loud tonight. It’s never quiet, not really, but tonight had a pulse to it. Every sound — laughter, whispers, glass clinking — stacked on top of the next until it turned into something alive. You could almost feel the heartbeat of the place.

A dozen species crammed into one dim room pretending they could coexist: nagas with their slow, flicking tongues between bursts of laughter; witches murmuring in Latin over wine that shimmered faintly in the light; a vampire ranting about fae glamour taxes to a banshee who looked one scream away from ending the conversation permanently.

It smelled like smoke, spilled beer, old liquor — and something faintly metallic beneath it. I didn’t ask what it was. You don’t ask questions like that in the Hollow Tap unless you’re ready for a story you can’t unhear.

Lucian and I had been sitting at the bar for hours. His drink — dark and thick — never emptied. Mine kept refilling too, though I couldn’t tell if I was ordering more or if the bartender just didn’t like empty glasses cluttering his counter.

Alcohol doesn’t do much for me anymore; whatever I am now burns it off too fast. Still, it loosened something in me — my shoulders, maybe. My caution.

“I never thought I’d find myself in a place like this,” I said, watching the amber light bend through my glass. “A supernatural bar. Surrounded by people I’m not trying to kill. Kind of nice, actually.”

Lucian’s smirk caught the neon behind the bottles. “I’m glad you’re comfortable among us,” he said, voice smooth as poured wine. “But don’t mistake comfort for safety. There are still plenty of our kind who need to be… handled when they overstep.”

There was that word — handled. Always so neat.

“You mean politics,” I said.

Lucian laughed quietly. “Always politics.”

He wasn’t wrong. Every species has rules. The Old Accords are supposed to keep peace, but they’re just ink and fear holding a fragile thing together. Everyone obeys because the alternative is extinction.

Take vampires — they can’t sire without approval from their Houses. Break that rule, and they strip your right to feed. For months, sometimes years. I’ve seen the results: the trembling, the ash-colored veins, the way their hunger hollows them until they forget language. Still, that’s what passes for mercy.

I turned the glass in my hand, watching the light fracture in it. “So what you’re saying,” I said finally, “is that you want me to be some kind of supernatural cop?”

Lucian blinked — then laughed, a full, rich sound that drew a few curious stares. He tilted his head, his teeth catching the light. “You do have a way of making things sound small, Jack. But yes… in a sense.”

Would be, not will be. He chose his words carefully, like always.

I didn’t push. The Hollow Tap wasn’t a place for clarity — it was a place for bargains that started as jokes and ended as obligations.

Around us, the bar throbbed with noise. Someone was playing the piano in the corner, badly. A trio of ghosts floated near the ceiling, their murmurs echoing in a language I didn’t recognize. A naga bartender slid past behind the counter, tail scraping against the wood, hissing softly at anyone in her way.

For a moment, I just let it wash over me — the chatter, the faint clatter of glass, the laughter that sounded almost human. It struck me that maybe I was the same — almost human, pretending it was enough.

Lucian caught me watching the crowd and smiled like he’d read my thoughts. “You see now why we need order,” he said. “Even this place — chaos as it is — exists because of rules. The right kind of fear keeps the wrong kind of blood from being spilled.”

He said it casually, but I heard the weight under it. Fear was the real government of our world. Always had been.

I sighed. “I’ve been trained as a hunter my whole life,” I said. “Maybe it’s time I used that for something better than killing.”

Lucian’s expression didn’t change much, but I could feel something shift in the air between us. Approval, maybe. Or interest.

“That’s good to hear, Jack,” he said, standing. His coat moved like liquid shadow when he turned toward the door. “Because as of tonight, you’re captain of the Supernatural Patrol Forts. S.P.F., if you want to sound bureaucratic.”

I raised a brow. “You realize that sounds like sunscreen, right?”

His grin showed the faintest hint of fang. “Then consider it protection.”

I laughed, shaking his cold hand. “Captain, huh? I’m barely out of my twenties. You sure you’re not setting me up to fail?”

His eyes glinted red. “We’ll just have to see if I am or not, won’t we?”

He left me with that, and the echo of his shoes on the steps leading down into the night.

A few days later, I met the team.

The armory in the Neutral Zone was nothing like the bar — brick walls slick with condensation, the air thick with the smell of oil and old iron. Rows of weapons lined the walls, each one labeled for a species it could kill.

Lucian stood beside me, perfect posture as always. Four sets of eyes were fixed on me, all different colors, all wary.

“This is Jack Hemmings,” Lucian announced. “He’ll be your squad leader. He’s a werewolf and a former hunter, which makes him uniquely suited for… diplomacy.”

A sound like a snort came from the biggest one — Ace Stronghorn, the minotaur. Built like a wrecking ball in tactical gear, seven feet tall, horns polished to a dull shine. His eyes, though, were all soldier — sharp, tired, unimpressed.

“So this is the hunter we’re supposed to follow?” he said, voice like gravel.

“Former hunter,” I corrected.

He crossed his arms, unimpressed. “We’ll see.”

Then there was Viper — tall, wiry, and far too still. Scales caught the light along her neck when she turned her head. Her green eyes didn’t blink enough to be comforting.

“I’ve heard stories about you,” she said softly. “Half ends in blood. The rest end in fire.”

“Depends who you ask,” I said.

Her lips twitched. “Guess we’ll find out.”

Finally, Gillette Vibe — and if there’s ever been a name that perfectly fit a person, that was it. A slimy humanoid with translucent skin shifting between blue and purple like an oil slick, with headphones glowing faintly.

“Yo, Captain Hemmings,” he said, voice bubbling like soda fizz. “Heard you’re the guy who cleaned out the Rochester nest. Nice work. But if you’re gonna shout orders, do it on beat, yeah?”

He snapped his fingers, and I swear the light flickered in rhythm.

I stared. “You’re serious?”

“Always,” he said, grinning — or doing something close to it.

Lucian looked almost entertained. “You’ll find they each have their own methods,” he said. “You’ll adapt.”

I looked over the three of them — a skeptical minotaur, a predatory naga, and a rave slime who probably had a Spotify playlist for combat.

I straightened my jacket, glanced at Lucian, then back at them. “Yeah,” I said. “I’ll adapt.”

Lucian left soon after, his footsteps fading into the hum of the outpost’s generators. The others went back to cleaning their gear or pretending not to watch me.

For a while, no one spoke.

Then I caught my reflection in the black steel of a weapon rack — tired eyes, a faint scar near my jaw, the look of someone who wasn’t sure which side he belonged to anymore.

The thought hit harder than I wanted it to.

I’ve been on hunts before.
But this time, the monsters are on my side.

The hum of the generators sounded like a heartbeat — steady, patient, waiting.
