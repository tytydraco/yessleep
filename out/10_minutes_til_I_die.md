“10 minutes.” The text arrived from an unknown number.

*What the hell?* I thought, balancing the cup of coffee in my left hand and my phone in the other.

The time was just shy of 7 am. It was the early morning commute in one of the biggest cities in America. My boss was waiting…

I dashed past the pawn shop. Stopped at a busy street corner. Cars whirred by, oblivious to us pedestrians.

“Don’t forget my latte!” Mrs. Platt had screamed at me the other day. “And don’t be late!”

*I’ll do my best,* I’d thought.

“9 minutes.”

*Huh?*

I ignored the text, waited for the crosswalk to change. *Why’d the cafe have to be so far away?!*

“R u coming?” A co-worker, Ben, messaged me.

“Yes. Almost there.”

The person next to me sneezed and I glanced up at the office building… only a few blocks away.

*Come on, crosswalk! Change!*

“8 minutes.”

*Seriously?!* “Who is this?”

“Your guardian angel. ;)”

“Leave me alone!” I blocked the number, stepped into the street as the crosswalk changed. I reached the opposite sidewalk.

Up ahead, the glittering tower of ***** Wealth Management awaited me. I’d worked so hard to secure this position. Platt was one of the wealthiest investment bankers in all of America. If I succeeded in this role, I could get a job anywhere.

I made it to the revolving doors, waved to the security guard.

“Morning, Moe.”

“Morning, Triss.”

*I like Moe. He’s nice to me.*

I stepped into the lobby. A mob of stressed-out PAs and interns filtered past, each desperate to prove their worth.

“5 minutes.” My phone buzzed.

*Damn bots…* My thumbs raced across the screen. “Stop texting me or I’ll call the police!”

I filed through the metal detector and progressed toward the elevators. It was like cutting through Tokyo traffic.

“Triss!” A voice hissed behind me.

I turned to see Ben, the resident East-coaster who had always managed to talk down to me.

“What’s taking you?”

“I got held up at the cafe.” He reached for the drink, but I stepped back. “I’ll bring it up.”

“Better do it quick. She’s about to start her meeting.”

*Ding.* Another text. “Time’s almost up.”

*Who is this?!*

I was so confused. If this was a scammer, how were they able to message me after I’d blocked their number?

“Everything okay?” Ben prodded.

“Yeah… I just keep getting these weird messages. I think someone’s hacked my phone.”

“Better figure that out. If your phone goes off in our meeting, Platt’ll kill you.”

I blocked the new number and followed Ben to the elevators. I wondered if one of the interns was the culprit. There were a few I recognized from casual visits at the bar. There was Paul, the transplant from Wisconsin. And Dessi, the overachiever from Harvard. But they didn’t know me enough to harass me, right?

*Ding.* The elevator arrow lit up and a collective sigh exited our lungs.

Another text.

“Get on your knees… right now…”

*What?*

“Do it… or die…”

I swiveled my gaze. About twenty of us were packed together, desperate to pile into the approaching elevator.

One of the interns, Vanessa, who I’d gone out with, eyed her phone, then looked up fearfully and knelt.

I wasn’t sure why, but out of instinct, I did the same. There was something about seeing her fulfill that action that compelled me to obey.

I didn’t even look up when I heard the first scream.

***

I still don’t know what happened. But when the elevator doors opened, something came out.

“Jesus!” “What the hell?!” “Ahh!”

I fell flat as bodies stampeded me. A woman’s heel bit into the back of my hand. A man’s knee collided into my spine. I gasped, feeling my bones crack as bodies trampled over me.

There was a gunshot. A loud squeal. And a thump.

I opened my eyes to see Moe, the security guard, white-knuckling his gun. Horror etched onto his face.

“My god… what… is that…”

Piled among the bodies was a bat-like creature, drenched in blood. Long incisor-like teeth jutted from its gaping mouth.

“You hurt?” He asked, pulling me up.

“No…” I wiped blood from my brow. “At least… I don’t think so…”

Another *ding* alerted me to my phone.

“Round 1 complete. Next 10 minutes will begin. ;)”
