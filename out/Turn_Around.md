The food court buzzed with white noise—conversation, clinking utensils, distant orders shouted in fast-food kitchens. It was a place designed to feel impersonal, yet my eyes kept drifting to them.

They sat at the corner table, their profile sharp against the fluorescent lights. Something about the way they moved was magnetic, effortless. They ate slowly and purposefully, as if they had endless time. In reality, I couldn't stop gazing, but I convinced myself it was simply a harmless attraction and nothing out of the ordinary.

I didn’t even know their name.

I rehearsed a dozen opening lines in my head. Each one felt stupid, forced. I felt more absurd the longer I sat there. I got up with clammy hands and stiff knees, my heart thumping in my chest. Just say hello. People talk to strangers all the time, right?

Each step toward their table felt heavier than the last. I was close enough to see the faint smile tugging at their lips, the way their hand lingered on the fork like they were savoring every detail of the moment.

And then, without warning, they stood.

My stomach dropped. They grabbed their tray and their bag in one fluid motion, moving like they had somewhere urgent to be. But before they left, they placed something on the table. A small, folded piece of paper.

With my name on it.

I froze. My name—handwritten, deliberate, like they’d been expecting me all along. The busy food court around me faded to background static as my thoughts raced. I hadn’t introduced myself. I hadn’t said a word.

I reached the table just as they disappeared into the crowd. I took up the paper with trembling hands and unfolded it slowly and carefully. The message inside was written in neat, precise handwriting.

"I’ve been waiting for you."

Even though the statements were straightforward, they had a powerful impact. I looked about in the hopes of seeing them, but they were nowhere to be seen. Vanished.

I turned the paper over, looking for some kind of explanation, some clue as to who they were or what this meant. But the only thing on the back was a smudged, faint red fingerprint.

My name. Their words. That print.

My hunger gone, I shoved the letter into my pocket and walked out of the food court.

I had trouble sleeping that night. I couldn't get the message out of my head; the more I thought about it, the more its significance unraveled.

I returned to the food court the following day. Same time. Same table. They weren’t there.

But a folded piece of paper was.

This time, there was no name on the outside. Just that same neat handwriting inside.

"Stop looking."

I couldn’t help it. I checked the back again. Another red fingerprint. This one fresher. Smudged, like it had been pressed in a rush.

The air felt heavier. The noises around me have become harsher and more jagged. After shoving the letter into my pocket, I walked away, looking at everyone in the throng.

Now, the notes keep coming. Slipped under my door, left in my mailbox, sometimes even in my car. Always the same handwriting. Always the same scent—faint, metallic.

How they know my name is a mystery to me. How they're tracking me is a mystery to me.

But the last note didn’t tell me to stop looking.
