My pencil makes led scratches against the canvas. Etching the cascading sunrays that shimmered from the calm current off the harbor here in Collingwood. The old grain elevator still stood tall after all these years, stalwart against the strains of time which had won some battles against the chipped away surface of this local historical site. Our town has seen an injection of tourist botox that has turned a naturally beautiful landscape into a silicone shell of its former self. Natural parks no longer brimming with pine trees and plantations that grow side by side, but instead a surgeon’s knife that had cut through the natural order, ripping out the roots and keeping what Instagram and tiktok viewers deem acceptable in a world of filter and falseness.   


I sat in my favorite spot on the road leading up to those historical terminals, working on my sketch when my work phone began to buzz relentlessly in my pocket. I put down my shading pencil, flipping open my phone. And yes, ‘flipping’ it open. I can hear your judgment behind these typed words.   


To give you an idea of what I do. I work as an independent personal support worker, meaning I own my own PSW company. I have my own clients, but things have slowed down over the past couple years due to a recession, along with inflation making my prices increase, and in turn, my clients heading to more affordable homes, rather than one-on-one care.   


“Hello. This is Kris Scott of Compassionate Care.” I said, trying to sound professional, covering up my deep desperation for more work.   


“Hello. My name is Dr. Khaleed. I work as a neurologist who specializes in Alzheimers. I was wondering if we could have you take care of one of our early symptomatic patients near London Ontario. When can I book you for an interview?”     


“I-I am free. Free whenever!” My overly giddy, stammering voice may as well have screamed ‘Please god, pay me!’   


“Excellent. Today is Monday, so perhaps tomorrow at three in the afternoon?”    


“Yes, of course. Thank you so much!”   


As soon as my thumb grazed the red phone icon to end the call, I was in my Hyundai and speeding off on the 401. Making my three-hour drive in two and a half and booking my room at the first hotel I set my sights on, which unfortunately was a Ramada.   


I scarfed down chicken wings that tasted like oven-baked fisher price plastic, then went right to bed. I wanted to feel as fresh and well rested as I could for my newest client, since my next client visit wasn’t for another week anyways.   


I had expected us to meet up in an office or at a hospital in the mid-sized city, but instead we met on an old dirt road just a little way outside the city, near a farmhouse. I will not give much description of the house, as all addresses are private.    


“So, are we doing the interview out here?” I tried to make light of this peculiar situation.   


“I apologize. Do you prefer Kris or…?” he asked politely, a kind smile had formed as he spoke.  


“Kris is fine. And you?”    


“You may call me Ameer. I have been the neurologist for this client for, well, let’s just say it has been a good portion of my professional career.” He let out a hearty laugh, his belly reverberating with each inhale.   


“She must be important to you.”    


Ameer nodded, motioning for me to follow him. As we moved closer to this impressive sized, three-story farmhouse, Ameer stopped, looking up at the sun bursting through a breach in the cloud coverage. As I looked around to marinade in this area, I could see a hawk with its wide-reaching wingspan swoop down and land swiftly onto a stump nearby the house, just up the hill.   


Ameer handed me a closed dossier. “These are your new clients’ paperwork. Should you choose to take on this job, of course.” His voice was emphatic with gratitude and a small pang of excitement hidden somewhere between his spoken words.   


“Yes. Yes of course!” I shook his hands and took the documents from him. My heart pounding with a mix of ecstasy and a touch of dread, given the new commute I had just inherited.  


He walked me to the porch of this old farmhouse, and it was the doors themselves that threw me through a loop. The doors were not your traditional wood doors with that initial screen door that never closes and always slams open and closed at the mere feel of wind.   


A metal double door with no handle whatsoever. Life itself punching me in the snout with a red flag.   


“Why?” was all I could ask when looking at this completely out of place contraption.   


“The first owner wanted his home turned into a facility for your new client. A facility to keep her safe. Out in this area the trucks rip down the highway at stupid speeds. Doesn’t want his last living relative to go out like that. Especially with her beginning to sundown.”   


To those that do not know what sundowning is a state of confusion that can happen in the late afternoon or night and can have all types of behaviors associated with it, all depending on the person and their situational triggers.   


I’ve had war veterans as clients who after eight at night would build a barricade or dig holes and lay in them for hours. Some would wander from one town to the next. Every person’s dementia and alzheimer’s are different. The same is for sundowning.   


When we entered, my red flag and that uncomfortable feeling in my stomach almost completely alleviated. If this was a facility. It was state of the art, all while feeling comfortable.   


Every shelf and cupboard had locks. This lucky lady had her own dietary aide who would come in and make all her meals. Central air, every form of streaming service you could ask. A wifi connection so powerful I could watch a live sport streaming service on internet explorer on my flip phone. Okay, maybe not explorer, but chrome most certainly.  


I know many of you assume that something crazy or weird would just happen that night I took the job, maybe that week? No. Nothing happened for nearly a year.    


I became so unbelievably happy with this client. I dropped all my others, and because the pay was substantial. I mean. Substantial.   


The rules of this client, Mrs Faulkner, were simple:   


-Do not let Mrs Faulkner sleep until just before sundown. Otherwise, she will wake up in a hysteria and begin to wander.    


-Mrs Faulkner always has her medicine after dinner, always before sundown as it will stabilize her serotonin, along with inducing sleep.   


-Should Mrs Faulkner wake up in the night, be wary of her disposition. Treat her as if she is sleepwalking and monitor her behaviour. Do not intervene unless need arises.   


Most these rules you will find are standard amongst retirement homes. They were more than easy to follow. They had been passed down by the owner of the home now turned facility, who as I would learn later down the line, was the power of attorney for Mrs. Faulkner. He had been her uncle and caretaker till his death a week before I was hired on. A multi-millionaire who had found great success as a dairy farmer and had several stakes in businesses all over the surrounding counties, so needless to say; Mrs. Faulkners inherited estate could afford all of this.     


I scanned my key card at the door, and when it buzzed, I opened the double doors, walking into a nice refreshing blast of cool air. I saw the dietary aide, Tracy, chopping her onions, boiling the rice, and making a pot of tea for our shared client.   


“Hey Trace!”    


She looked back up at me with a smile, her eyes watery from the fresh onion, “Her girl!” she called out, tossing the pieces onto the frying pan. That satisfying sizzle immediately following.   


“How’s Mrs. Faulkner today?” I asked, putting my bags into the closet, and then locking it.  


“She is doing better since her fall in the shower last night. Poor thing. They had her up all night last night, and she has been awake all day today.”   


“Where is she now?” I asked.  


Tracy pointed in the living room, where Mrs. Faulkner sat in her lazy boy recliner, sitting in the dark, scribbling away at her notepad.     


Mrs. Faulkner was likely a tall woman, she had a hunch and needed a walker as she moved, so it was hard to fully gauge her height. Even as a hunched over person, she was nearly six feet tall.    


She was African American, curled dark hair and would always tell us about her stories growing up in South Africa. Then moving here with her family when she was in her mid-twenties to attend school.  


For a woman in her late seventies, she still tried to take care of herself. Vegetarian diet. Practiced yoga, even despite her physical limitations. She also deeply loved reading and drawing, writing too. She was a woman of many hobbies and talents.   


I sat with her, trying to get a peek at her drawing, but as usual, she playfully hid her work from me. A new habit she had been forming these past three or four days.   


“It’s not ready, Kris.” she said with that familiar and kind smile forming on her face.   


“Just a quick glance!” I said playfully.   


She held her notebook to her chest, “I think not!” she laughed, waving me off in a joking manner.  


“Alright you two. The meals cooked. All the cabinets are locked back up. Don’t make a mess of it while I am gone.” Tracy waved goodbye and made her way out the door and into her car.    


Our day was a mostly routine one. I bathed Mrs. Faulkner. Gave her dinner, she took her medications and then it was off to bed. Her bedroom being the last room, end of the hall on the second floor. She refused to take the guest room on the first floor. Always insisting that the stairs ‘kept her young.’  


“Alright Mrs. Faulkner. Time to get some sleep.”   


Right after I had said those words, I can still remember vividly the crashing of wind against the house and the way it creaked, the foundation groaning against the gale force.   


“Hard to do with all that racket!” Mrs. Faulkner complained.   


“Lucky enough for you, you’ve got strong meds.” I said with a wink. Making sure my favorite client was tucked in and comfy before leaving.    


“Maybe if the oncoming storm wakes me up, we can play hardloop of sterf” her smile extended on her face.   


“Oh, and how do we play…that?” I asked, a little baffled by her unusual request.  


“It’s a game I used to play a lot back home. I’ll teach it to you. You only need to play once.” She closed her eyes, that smile still plastered on her face.   


As I left the room, I quickly glanced behind me to make sure she was still tucked in bed. She was still lying in bed, but her grin was wide, daggered teeth. Her eyes imprinted on my spine.   


That was the first time ever that I saw her like that. Like she scared me. And she wasn’t even trying.  


At least, not that time.   


I closed the door and in truth, sped off downstairs to grab my cellphone which was still charging on an end table in the living room. Just as I reached for it, the ringtone blared its tune so loud it made me jump. I shook off my own stupidity and answered it.  


“Hello?” I asked. My voice quaking.   


“Kris, it’s Ameer. Is Mrs. Faulkner in bed?”    


I was a little taken aback by the question. For almost a year I had done this job without missing a beat.  


“Yes?” my voice likely sounded a little defensive.   


“Did she take her medication?”   


“Yes.” I reassured him.  


“Okay. Good, good. That’s good.” His sighs of relief only made me feel more bothered.  


“What is the matter?” In truth, I wanted to ask him what his problem was. I knew how to do my job.  


“When she was at the hospital there was a situation.” My wounded pride turned to concern in seconds. 


“Situation? What happened Ameer?”  


“From what I hear she didn’t get her medication due to the concussion she suffered. I don’t know if something happened, but they’ve requested me at the hospital A.S.A.P. Listen. I’ll call you as soon as I know what’s going on. Just hang tight and be careful, okay?”   


The line ended immediately.   


“Be careful?” I said the words out loud, then swallowed the fear that emanated from the most unlikely of statements.  


I made my way to the guest room that was now fashioned into a work office of sorts, closing the door behind me. I began to step towards the computer desk in the center of the room when that all too familiar feeling of paranoia and over-reaction hit me like an anxiety tidal wave and rushed back to the door, locking it.  
  

I perched myself on that god awful gaming chair that we inherited from Tracy’s son for our workspace. Booting up the PC and began to type away at an overview of the night so far. Essentially working through the nightly expectation checklist.   


Our computer also had live feed of cameras all throughout the house. A necessary breach in privacy to keep Mrs. Faulkner alive and in good condition.   


I scanned through the live feed. All was well. Mrs. Faulkner still practically swaddled in her bed.   


It was clacking away at the keyboard when I noticed a note from the previous worker, Abigail. She had been taking care of the previous owners’ estate when there was one item still unaccounted for.    


An access code to the locker directly behind me.     


Thunder began to bellow low warning groans that whiffed by my ignorant ears.    


I left the office to do my hourly check around the house and on my client. Leaving the office, I made my way up the stairs and toward Mrs. Faulkner’s room when a blinding stream of light came crashing near the house, followed by the crackling boom of thunder.   


I dashed into her room, causing poor Mrs. Faulkner to shoot up out of bed. The way she clutched her chest I thought I had put the old bat in cardiac arrest.   


“Oh, my lord Kris. You should be a little more careful considering you have to clean and change me!” she yelled.     


Something about that statement made me feel at ease, in truth. Something in her voice that felt docile. That lack of that smile, that natural fear. Palpable, real jitter that felt…human.    


I wish she had stayed like that.   


I apologized to her, checked on her vital signs, even did a memory test to ensure that she was not in a sundown or delusional state.     


After cooing her back into her bed, I began to tuck her in.     


“If you sleep through the night, maybe we can play that game you wanted to play?” I suggested to her, to which she just gave me a rather odd stare, handing me the glass she had finished drinking.   


I wanted to pursue further but she had got so worked up, she was crashing hard and needed sleep. So instead, I kept it to myself.  


The power flickered throughout the halls until finally the main power failed, and the backup generator did not start up. Managing to fumble my way down the stairs I made my way back to the office, collecting my phone and noticed a missed call from the good Doctor Ameer himself.   


I dialed him back. He picked up the phone in less than a ring. He was breathing. Breathing hard.  


“I’m on my way to you, Kris. Is Mrs. Faulkner still asleep?” his voice was rushed, panicked.   


“I just put her back to bed. She woke up during the storm, but I did the tests and…”  


“Fuck the tests, Kris! Do not let Mr. Faulkner sleep!” My heart sank so deep in me I could have crapped it out right then and there.   


“She is sleeping. I’m…I’m sorry. Wait. What happened? What did you find out?”   


“She is fixating Kris. Fixating dangerously. Her routine is messed up. There was never any concussion. She injured herself to get into the hospital and mess up her routine intentionally. Her drawings Kris. They are violent. They depict violence against all of us. These images. The words. This is some criminal, sycophant, planned, pervasive behaviour.”   


I said nothing. I melted into that chair. Staring endlessly at the locked door in front of me. My cameras were dead, and with the entire facility being key card and internet and power controlled. I was locked inside this place. 


Locked in with her.    


“Keep your distance, Kris. Stay safe. I will be there with emergency services. Hang tight.”  


The call ended. I felt the phone slip from my face, surprising that in that moment it did not drop to the floor, instead falling harmlessly into my lap.   


Something in that moment. In that feeling of despair and fear, a flicker of something hit. An epiphany.   


I turned to the locker behind me. When the power went out it would run on battery, so I had time enough to enter a passcode into the pin pad.   


Hardloop of stern. Nothing. I sighed. Then decided another hail mary idea of sorts.   


Good old google translate.    


I entered Mrs. Faulkners words into the translator. Afrikaans to English. Expecting it to say some sort of classic kids’ game or some rendition of the sort. No. It was not that. It was not that at all.   


It translated to ‘Hide or Die’.
