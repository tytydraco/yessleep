I don't feel comfortable sharing my name, but I will say I live alone and have four cats, their names are Jeep, Volvo, Yoda, and Clyde. They aren't all from the same litter, Jeep and Volvo are both thirteen but are a few months apart, Yoda is two years old and Clyde just turned one.

They are all very loving and dicks at the same time, but aren't all cats? Recently I noticed that Jeep has stopped eating with his siblings and will wait till either they are all done, or if I put his food bowl in another room away from the others. As far as I know, my cats don't fight with each other, I want to make it clear I have no idea what was wrong with Jeep, but just the other day I heard him say "Dad", he looked at me when he did.

I heard that cats could sometimes mimic people, but this was still unsettling. That night after taking a shower, I went to bed earlier than I usually do. My sleep schedule wasn't the best and I thought I was only hearing things, so I thought sleeping early would help. I had my eyes shut for about thirty minutes before I heard a voice say "hi", I jolted up and looked around. I only saw my cats sleeping bundled up together, my door was open slightly, but that was in case the cats needed to leave and enter my room.

I got out of bed and investigated my apartment. I couldn't find any signs of a break-in, and my door and windows were locked. I was perplexed.

"Where did that "hi" come from?" I thought to myself

I went back to bed after checking once more around the apartment, my cats were still sleeping as I crawled into bed and shut my eyes. I woke up three hours before my alarm at 3:33 a.m. I tried going back to sleep but just couldn't, so I decided to watch movies on my phone until I nodded off.

"God" I heard.

I got up and looked around, nothing again.

"What the hell is going on?" I thought, "Is my apartment haunted?"

Just then, Jeep jumped onto my bed. He was rubbing up against me wanting to be petted, I sighed and rubbed my eyes before giving him what he wanted. I felt like such an idiot, I've lived in his apartment for years and nothing supernatural has ever happened, my sleep schedule was absolutely fucked if I was hearing random voices.

"Sorry I woke you up, Jeep." I apologized, luckily the others were still sleeping together in their little car bed.

I had lain back down in bed to get comfy, and Jeep stood on top of me as I watched whatever movie I could find on my phone. He stayed like that for ten minutes before lying on my shoulder, I could feel his breath on my neck as he began to sleep. I smiled, I didn't wanna turn my head to see because I'd wake him up, but I bet he looked cute.

"God" was whispered into my ear and I froze. "God... Is... Coming..." the whisper said.

 I turned my head slowly, I wanted to confirm who the voice belonged to, it was Jeep. I screamed as I got out of bed and threw Jeep off in the process. 

"God... Is... Coming..." Jeep said again, I stared at him and panicked, "Cats can't talk! What the hell is this!?" I shouted.

"God... Is... Coming..." another voice said, I turned my head to see Volvo, She yawned and stretched as she awoke. She looked at me as she stuck her tongue out. 

"God... Is... Coming..." She said.

Yoda and Clyde soon woke up and repeated the same words as Jeep and Volvo. "God... Is... Coming...".

I didn't know what to do, my cats were now rubbing up against me and purring as they continued to speak. I fell backwards, opening my bedroom door more, I quickly got up and ran outside my apartment. I didn't even put on my shoes, as I ran down the stairs and slammed the outside door open.

It wasn't till I ran down the street that I stopped to catch my breath. My head was tucked between my legs. My mind was consumed with confusion as I tried to wrap my head around what just happened.

"God... Is... Coming..." voices from beside me began to chant, I turned to an alleyway to see that it was a pack of stray cats. I heard a scream that didn't belong to me, I turned my head towards the direction and saw that someone's house lights were on.

"Richard! He spoke!" a woman screamed, "He spoke!"

More screams of confusion and fear followed as the street became lit by the lights of houses as their owners awoke. I wasn't the only one who heard the voices.

Suddenly, the brightest lights appeared in the sky. At first, I thought they belonged to helicopters, but as I looked up, I saw multiple disc-shaped objects in the sky. I couldn't believe what was in front of me. The only thing I could hear now was the chanting of the cats, except it was different now.

"God... Is... Here..."
