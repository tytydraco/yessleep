I Regret The Operation

Post op journal 

Day one

Hey.

So yeah, my doctors ordered me to keep a journal, which is apparently standard for post op.

I guess having a record of my symptoms and such is gonna be more reliable than just my testimony at follow ups. I do wish I knew more about what exactly those symptoms are gonna be, but.. I guess that's the trade off when you get something experimental like this done. Well okay, they don't like me calling it that, it's ‘exclusive’ and ‘cutting edge,’ front of the line treatment and if it works, then I don't have to be on medication for the rest of my life. Or have any more surgeries, ever. It's supposed to become the new safe first step treatment, if that's true.

I have my doubts. But, at least so far I feel just fine. Great.

No bleeding, no pain, even at the incision site which is definitely a first. They said the first few days will feel fine, at least till the lidocaine wears off. It does feel a bit, tingly, I guess? Like something is buzzing in the back of my head, or kind of like when you get shocked by static electricity. just continuous. Not the worst, but annoying when I think about it. Kind of like manual breathing. When you realise you're not doing it on purpose, and then you can't forget about it, and you have to decide to breathe. Each time. Until you forget about it again.

I did expel the first bile, at uh.. 4 am, and bagged it for testing, of course. It's really fascinating the kinds of things they can pick up about you from that. It keeps a record of your entire genetic profile, and depending on viability they say it can even pick up on things like what's supposed to be your favorite color. Or at least the color you've looked at the most. It was a lot more.. Mobile? Than I expected? The medication in my system was supposed to make it slower, at least as sluggish as I am, but it was quite lively once it climbed out. It smelled like yeast and battery acid, and it looked disgusting. Eventually I managed to kick a trash can over it and bag it from there.

I do feel incredibly lucid, and.. Pure? Like in an empty way. Like waking up and you feel 100 pounds lighter, even if nothing about you has physically changed. Nothing about me has physically changed. But I'm still grounded, everything feels more vibrant.

I'm already thinking differently, or at least coming to different conclusions about things. I dont think ive felt this.. Present in years, at least not since I was in school. At least, I think I was in school. Clear headed. Some confusion, I guess.

So. In conclusion. 

I'm well.

Day one synopsis:

Pain: none

Mobility: low. Numbness in legs and hands, as expected.

Mood: stable. Fine.

******: first day bile was black in color and difficult to wrangle. The sample bag has been sealed from oxygen and twitching has ceased. 

Day 2: 

I'm beginning to wonder about regret. I mean, can you regret something you don't remember? I feel like I've done something wrong. Something before the surgery, but everything before is foggy and.. I'm not hearing voices or anything, but I am remembering things people were saying to me. I don't know these people, but they weren't doctors. And there were so many of them, standing in my room and.. Well I cant find any sign of them. In fact, there's no one here, in the whole house. I was finally able to move again today, and I was able to make it to the main floor of the house. It's older than I remember. And I know no one is home, because if they did they would have heard me screaming, or I would have heard them. Am I supposed to be quarantined after my surgery? I couldn't find anything about it in the aftercare instructions, which I checked when I crawled back. I'm gonna check the website after this, maybe they can send somebody. Regardless, I am eating and drinking normally. I don't know where the food is coming from, but it's always here. I can't find it, but I can smell it really strongly, everywhere, like it's in the walls or vents. It smells the way sugar tastes. When it's wet and clumped. Why someone would be doing that i dont know, but at least I do have the granola bars right next to my bed, so I'm okay for now. But I hope they stop, I cant reach it and the food will go bad in there. My jaw hurts now, but that's normal for an all granola diet. I guess I'm lucky that's the only pain I'm experiencing. 

The buzzing has expanded, to my hands and feet and down my back. It's like a tingling almost, like menthol cigarettes or pop rocks candy. It's not bad, but a little distracting, but hopefully it means the use of my legs will be coming back. I do feel more energetic, I dont think ill be sleeping through the night. Feeling really good right now. Feel alive. 

Music helps.

Day 2 synopsis

Pain: mild, 2/10 at most

Mobility: low, but more energy

Mood: great, happy, excited. A little scared

******: first day bile testing returned as normal. No second day bile. 

[Drs. voicemail transcript: No diagnosis, or detailed analysis yet, but it passed all the major tests, so there's some comfort in that. You are currently testing negative, and  H.F.P.F consumer copies can often take 60-90 days to process, roughly when the patient is fully recovered, patient being, you, of course haha. Anyway, get well soon, rest and drink plenty of water, and keep in touch]

Concerns

… I have no concerns. I dont know why I wrote that. 

concerns

Sorry. That's not on the form.

…

Memory. Please help. I keep forgetting something.

Day 3:

I logged on to the website first thing in the morning. Or rather, when I woke up, which was not morning, in fact actually, so:

Day 3

I logged on to the website first thing in the morning. Or rather, when I woke up, which was not morning, in fact actually, so:

Day 4: 

I logged onto the website first thing in the afternoon, and discovered my account had been locked out. Apparently there was some issue with the insurance, and they can't give me access until my payment has cleared? Which doesn't make any sense, because my mom paid out of pocket, I know she did, her receipt is in the paperwork. But whatever, I still get access to my doctors office and post op recovery care, it just might take longer because they're so backed up with patients compared to the website. There's like a million people running the site and only the one office in the country that performs this study, or.. procedure.. or at least, they're the only licensed clinic in several states that actually has a success rate. successes . So, that's good right? Because they probably knew what they were doing, and this gives me the highest chance for success, and actual repair, not growth around what's wrong with me, not LiViNg WiTh It just.. Gone. all of it. 

I don't feel like me yet. But I never did before this either, really. Standard day 4 stuff. My memory is still foggy, and my energy is low again. But I am regaining feeling in my legs, and when I did finally sleep I slept well. Really well. My dreams were very vivid, and.. Composed? I'm not sure what word to use.

Empty, and quiet. 

No people, besides me. No faces, or voices, or anything else, except reflections.

Reflections in the water and the dew on the trees, or shards of glass. It was beautiful, and quiet, but the whole place had a very pleasant hum. It felt familiar, and I still hear the sound of it as I'm typing this, which is a nice change from constant ringing in the ears. 

And no nightmares. 

So that's one reduction of a negative symptom! But, my fingers are too numb to type, so the rest of the recovery journal is gonna be dictated by some app. I think it's mostly because it's way too cold in here, why my fingers arenmt cooperating.

Ah, okay and I'm finally off hold now.

end.

---

Wow. okay. 

Are you kidding me? The payment was refunded, because she did it on one of her credit cards and then closed the account? Or the bank closed it?? So now I have to take it up with the bank, because she is not picking up my calls and.. the fact that I know money shouldn't be a problem, for us, doesn't make it better, this is still urgent because I need post op care, and they cant afford to dispatch a caregiver for me until the payment goes through, and she's not picking up my calls.

Mom picked a really bad time to skip town, or whatever she's doing that resulted in this. Careless, and frustrating because I know it was her idea anyway. The whole.. Thing, the.. 

I remember now, she was one of the people I remember, in my room singing and swaying, pleading with me to get the surgery,

 and I did. 

She said, it was the one thing, after the hospital and-

No, I- 

yes doctor I'm sorry, i didnt catch that. 

Ok. thank you. 

-

They're sending me the meds for day 5. On rush order since I'm already entering stage IV. 

Luckily, that means I get my legs back. 

They're weak, and I can't stand straight up, but I can take slow steps. Enough to move around the house more.

I dont recognise it. I thought I did, but I was wrong. 

I had the nightmare again. That's where I recognise it from. 

Good thing the pills are coming soon.

Pain: none, with reduced sense of touch.

Mobility: returning

Mood: 

*****: fading. Burning of the esophageal tract. Reduced perception of the color purple.

Day 5:

I can feel my legs and arms again, and I don't like it. I hate it. My fingers are still numb, and weak, like they're moving through honey. I keep dropping my pills.

The doctor said to take one every six hours. I took two, for good measure. 

My symptom reduction has accelerated. 

The dr said that could be a concerning sign, since this procedure must follow a very specific aftercare schedule, and id be their only patient so far to request a caretaker or house visit. They said everyone else in the study has had no complications. If i'm falling behind, they can't be liable for what happens but they will try to help me however they can.

I heard something. It sounds like someone's in the house. 

It must be the rat, sneaking food into the house, or eating it. That's where it's coming from.

--

I tried to find a bat for the rat. The papers were inside the desk. I found what happened to the account, it was closed because she paid it out. She was the recipient. They paid her.

So then why am I still being sent a bill?

This is wrong. This is fucking wrong and that woman, is not my mother, she cant be, because thats not my name. That's not my name on the receipt. That's not what she looked like. 

The people in the room weren't real. Whoever was given the money for putting me in the study, was not my relative and they’re long gone. 

E. Bleuler. That's the name on the check, that's who I need to find.

Or, I need to speak to someone at the website. I have to get that money back, so I can resume my care. 

I think I pulled a stitch in my stomach. This little excursion cost me in pain. 

And I didn't find the rat.

Pain: yes

Mobility: variable. None, at the moment.

Mood: hurtinmg

*********: itching and scabbing around the injection site. No blood, but a slow crystalline discharge, white in color. Will order anti dandruff shampoo

Meds seem to be helping. I mean, I'm still feeling better than before the surgery. But there's a gap between where the meds wear off, before the next pair hit my bloodstream, that is unbearable. 

I can't take them closer together, though, or I risk an overdose, and internal bleeding. 

My post op kit includes an IV. Needles.

And I'm still in stage IV.

I watched some tv. Phone. A screen of some kind. The study is on the news, which I didnt mean to click but there it was, and I couldn't just skip past. Thankfully it's been deemed a success. My heart went back into my chest in relief. They named all my symptoms, listed in the recovery process that everyone is following. I'm still on track. And so far no one is testing positive for ******, so it works! It fucking works, and I got to be a part of the first successful trial! I shouted at my tv when I saw my name listed in the list of study participants, and the news anchors were reading out all the names and thanking us personally. 

“And thank you, lakjasderngfpokaiejnrmso wkejrtgn, you will be forikojtfngoikknertgoi in our hepaosjkrfpdion-”

I tapped the screen, but the static continued.

“Ksahjudfgbiwukshiopj aslikusdhf-op8ijpkoijsa, skjhb fpiuahpoihj aksjudfbhgioah hjusadnfp;kvjn n hjnf lkn dkj vl’asjden frvoisn bl’ s[o9tujg”

It was getting louder and louder. My fingers keep slipping. The volume button was going up by itself! The buttoNS DONT WORK I CANT REACH fuck thats so loud!

There. 

It's broken now.

I didn't know what to do. I even unplugged it. And it was hurting me, but now I have no tv, which isn't great.

I don’t think i can get back up to plug it in again

Oh shit, what time is it, uh..

Day 6

I got a call from work.

I was supposed to be back today. I lost track of time.

Day 7

Day 8 and my boss was not happy. At all. She called me two hours after my first shift back was apparently supposed to start, but I just sent her a picture of my legs. She didn't respond, so I'm either fired or off the hook, but either way I'm not ready to go back yet. They said online everyone was at stage IV, but they also said in the consult that we'd only need a week off and be ready for work, with no heavy lifting by day 6 and then we'd be done with this stage and be healing, its supposed to be healing why wont it heal why wont it heal why wont it heal i

Have to

Calm down. I'm pulling my stitches.

Pain

Mobilit54y no

Mood

I'm so alone in this. I thought my mom would be here, or.. Whoever that lady was. She's not my mother.

My mother is dead.

Day 9

Nobody's called today. My boss, my.. Doctor. 

My phone is low on charge. I don't understand why I still can't move. I itch all over. I took a picture of my legs and arms. 

I can't see it myself, but in the picture there is just a writhing mass of purple and veins and splotches and I.. 

Oh god. It was a live photo.

I'm gonna be si-

\

Ksxz 

Fuck

Fuckfuckfuck

Call hospital

Call hoispital

Call hospital

…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

Oh god

Okay I found it. God help me remember how to do this

Ah-

okay. Okay. okay.

The shot helps, but.. Fuck. I definitely pulled a few stitches.

And there goes the second day bile. Or whatever day it is now.

Off you run, little thing.

That's a bad sign.

Call my doctor

---

I'm on hold again. They have the same robot lady from the website doing intake now. She wanted me to describe my ‘problems’ before connecting me to the office. Apparently expelling the second day bile AND pulled stitches AREN'T enough of a problem to get the direct line, but she's rerouting me to billing, so.. Maybe an actual human will help me talk to a doctor, or nurse or someone who actually knows why this could be happening

---

They're gone. 

That wasn't Janice, that wasn't the clinic. I looked it up, and it's gone, I don't know if theft changed their name or got shut down or killed but.. Whoever was on the other line said the practice had dissolved, and she needed to handle my ’billing problem’ before referring me for care and i just hung up on her, becaUSE I'M BLEEDING THROUGH MY BANDAGES AND THROUGH MY SHIRT

I'm going to die here. Ium going to die, because of this stupid operation, that i cant even remember who told me to get it, i cant remember who i was, and i'm dying thats all i am now

I have a little bit left. 

Shes here.

I have been seeing her, whoever she is, in the mirrors and broken glass, and in the vents. She won't stop smiling. Last night she hovered above my bed, looking down at me with a huge smile that never twitched or, or stopped, just a big shape even in the dark and between my fading consciousness and haze, and big round soulless eyes, with my passport, all my papers, clenched in her hand, but on all of them, my face was gone. Instead, I was just her face. 

She was eating my second day bile. Still smiling. It twitched inside her, like the veins in my legs did. I don't need the camera to see it now. I am rotting from the inside. 

The incision is a gaping hole now, purple and crusted over, solid. The scabs taste like sugar, and they sparkle like the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

No blood.

I tried to tie the stitches back together, but it’s no use. I just dug the gash deeper honestly.  I think she's been cutting them, whenever I sleep. Or pass out. I'm trying to keep my eyes open, but the pain, and the numbness, it's.. I feel both, at once. 

And that's so much worse than nothing.

I hate that it's ending this way. I hate it for my real mother, or whoever cared about me before this. But I think I know what will happen, if I don't.

She is going to crawl inside. 

Just needs me to breathe, or beat for her. It. whatever.

I have enough, to stop that. 

I'm going to wait, until she gets closer. When it's too late for her to pull back out of me 

I don't know what will happen to me. I'm probably dead. 

I'm going to send this out somewhere, to any place that might even pretend to believe me, or care what's happening.

I don't know what you can do about it.

I just wish I wasn't going through this alone.
