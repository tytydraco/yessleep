Good things will come. 

Repeat it in your head. That’s what she used to tell me. 

“Say it over and over. Whenever things get dark. Whenever you start to lose hope. Say it enough, and you’ll make it happen. Good things will come.”

Manifestation. Karma. Prayer. She never told me exactly what the secret was. Maybe that’s why it’s never seemed to work. I still say it though. Over and over. 

Good things will come. Good things will come. Good things will come. 

It’s not that I’m an actual believer. I’m just really fucking desperate. 

I thought I did everything right. When I was younger, they told me to go to school, get a degree, get a job. Pave the way for the American Dream. So, that’s what I did. Straight A’s. Summa Cum Laude. Internship after internship that finally landed me a job that didn’t pay enough to make rent. I told myself it was fine. I was twenty-two. I didn’t need a lot. I moved back home. She was happy for the company, anyway. 

“It’s okay,” she told me. “Don’t worry, Sara. Good things will come.” 

The words stuck, even if she didn’t. Four jobs later, another layoff, and I’m still saying the words.

I turn off the sink. Water drips from my chin as I rip a sheet of pulpy paper from the dispenser. I’ll have to replace the roll again. 

The mirror has a crack running through the corner. Corporate knows about it. Bethany filed a report before she quit three days into my onboarding. She filed reports for a lot of things, though. She kept carbon copies in a basket in the break room, dating back to when she started a year ago. Her legacy. Not that it did any good.

At least she had a legacy to leave. Mine seems to be jobs with every-lessening pay and ever-growing hours. And, hey, I heard she’s making at least a dollar fifty more at Target now. 

I dry my face. The crack warps my mouth into a strange line that turns even stranger as I speak. 

“Today’s the day. Good things will come. Good things will come.” 

It starts ten minutes later, when he comes into the store. 

The electronic chime pulls me away from restocking the shelves. I peel myself off of the ladder just in time to see him hurrying down Aisle 1. 

“Can I help you find something?” I can’t keep the dead tone out of the question.

He doesn’t even look at me. 

“I need to use the shitter.” 

“Oh.” 

I pause, remembering my half-hearted training, and wonder if it’s worth it. But the Type A bursts out. Straight-A syndrome is hard to break, even when you’ve lost any kind of dedication to the job. “Sorry, but our bathrooms are only for customers.”   
  
“Oh, fuck off.” 

He keeps walking, taking enough time before turning the corner to flip me off. A second later the handle rattles, and he’s back in view. 

“The fucking door is locked.” 

“I know. You have to ask for the key.” 

“Give me the fucking key.” 

He’s just a kid. Seventeen, maybe eighteen. I look outside. The only car in the parking lot is a shiny new Tesla. Two other kids are climbing out of it, wearing expensively distressed t-shirts and sweats. They spot us through the window and start making faces. One of them makes a fist and starts pantomiming jerk-off motions. That’s not what pisses me off. It’s the small, undeniable certainty I have that these assholes will somehow get further in life than me. 

“Buy a fucking pen.” 

He blinks. 

“What?”

“This is an Office Supply Store. Buy a fucking pen, and I’ll give you the key.” 

I hold my ground as he takes a step closer. 

“Let me ask you something, bitch. If I decide to say fuck the bathroom and take a shit right here in the aisle, who would have to mop that up?” 

I don’t answer. He grins. Outside, his friends start catcalling and grinding against the window. For the first time since her departure, I wish for Bethany. I think of the stack of papers still sitting in the break room, and about how much I don’t want to write a report for shit stains on the linoleum. 

I hand him the key.

“That’s what I thought.” 

His hand brushes mine as he takes it. It’s soft. Lotioned, pampered. Then, he pushes over an end cap display and tucks into the bathroom. 

“Good things will come.” 

I hear it as I’m crouching down to pick up rolls of fallen Scotch tape and Sharpees. A whisper through the empty aisles. 

“Good things will come.” 

“Hello?” 

My knees creak as I stand up. It’s not a sign of age so much as the feeling of being beaten down but the sound is deafening. It takes a minute to realize why. 

There’s no more laughter coming from outside. 

I walk to the window, expecting to see the two guys climbing back into the Tesla, but the car is empty, the lights turned off. They’re gone. 

“Good things will come.” 

I wheel, searching for the speaker. I don’t know who it would be. I’m not supposed to be training Bethany’s replacement for another two days, and the door chime has been mute since the asshole went to the bathroom.   
The asshole. It’s him. It has to be. 

The toilet flushes. 

He comes out a few minutes later. 

“You’re bathroom’s shit,” he says. “Should have just gone on the floor. Looks like you’re going to have some clean up anyway.” 

I stare at him as he holds up the key, waiting for him to explain why he said what he said.   
  
He sighs and shifts. 

“I don’t need a fucking pen, okay? Just take your damn key.” 

Another whisper, one more time. 

“Good things will come.” 

It wasn't him. He doesn’t react. Doesn’t even blink, until the body hits the window. The thump jolts us both, but neither of us understand the smear of red it leaves behind. 

“What the–” 

He rushes to the window, staring down at the sidewalk without understanding.

It’s one of the friends, though I can only tell by the t-shirt he’s wearing. The rest of his face is gone. It would be impossible to look away from, if it wasn’t for the scream. 

He’s standing in the parking lot, a scared cat looking for a place to run. The second friend, the one who’d jerked off at me in the window. I don’t see what’s cornered him until it ripples in the moonlight. And I’m struck by the fact that it doesn’t look scary at all. In the second that it passes between light and shadow, it looks almost like her. My mom. 

As soon as I think it, she moves, a streak of pale skin in a darkening night. The scream stops. The asshole flinches as two more thumps rattle the window. His friend, in pieces, joins the bloody heap outside. 

“What the fuck!” 

“I don’t…I don’t know–” I can’t make sense of it, either. 

He fumbles for his phone. 911. It hadn’t even occurred to me. He starts shrieking into it as the woman turns her face to the store window. 

“What are you doing? Lock the door!” 

It takes a minute to realize the order is meant for me. I lurch forward as he backs further into the aisle, frantic for a place to hide, before I remember.    
  
“What are you waiting for?” 

“It’s an automatic system. It locks on its own, on a timer.” 

He swears, still screaming into the phone. 

The woman moves closer. 

I start moving to the back of the store. 

“Wait, where are you – don’t leave me!” 

“There’s an emergency exit at the back.” I’m surprised by how calm I sound. The exit is in the same alcove as the bathroom. Even while numb, my brain works. His never will. Critical thinking has its uses. 

He stumbles at my heels, trying to look over his shoulder at the door as he runs. The woman is there now, right in front of the door. The sealant squeaks as it slides open. 

I push the bar on the emergency door. An alarm splits the asshole’s broken sobs as he starts to cry. 

The door is only a few inches open when I see her, waiting. Here. Not at the front, though I know she was there only a second ago. Were there two of them? I start to retreat. 

Then she smiles, and I forget my confusion. Fear. Panic. 

I push the door wider. She pats my cheek as she steps past. The touch is soft, the skin papery with age and wrinkles, the feeling as warm as it was before the cancer had leeched it from her body. 

“Good things will come, Sara.” 

For the first time in a long time, I feel something like hope. 

Good things will come.
