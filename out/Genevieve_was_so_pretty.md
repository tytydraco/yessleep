Genevieve was always so cute and funny. She wore this pink, sparkly lipgloss almost every day. Her eyes were green just like a fresh pear and I was always getting lost in them. Her red hair smelled like coffee and milk. I loved Genevieve much more than anyone could imagine. I always wanted to be near her. Sadly, it seemed like she was not into me. I was trying to get her attention really hard but she was ignoring me all the time.

*Gen! Please come outside! Please, I've got something for you!*

*Leave me alone, Olivier/*

I was often getting her different gifts. But she didn't like death rats or raccoons. One day I even tried to give her something bigger, so when I saw that her dog got lost in the park, I decided to create some art and suprise her. I killed the dog and cut his head off. I painted it pink (it was her favorite color! that is so cute!) and sprinkled some glitter.

The next day I appeared in front of her house and rang the bell. When Genevieve opened the door, she passed out, but I think she was just so happy and got butterflies when she saw me there!

It was a rainy and gloomy day when I showed up at her house again with flowers and a heart of some homeless cat I found on the street. She started yelling at me.

*I never even liked you, Olivier, please stop! I hate you! How dare you even show up at my house! I hate you I hate you I hate you!*

I got really mad this time. I put really much effort, I tried really hard and wanted her to adore me, and now that's how she treats me?

*You will pay for this, Genevieve.*

Now Genevieve is smiling at me cutely. Okay, maybe it's more like I'm trying to form a smile on her face. I'm putting some lipgloss on those kissable lips, then I kiss them softly and smile, looking into her beautiful eyes. I'm about to kiss her again when suddenly someone knocks on the door. Ah, probably those goddamn cops, trying to find Gen. I pick up her cut-off head and place it under my desk. I just hope they won't find out.

  *I'm really sorry Genevieve, I just got really mad*

*.*Today is the day. The day of my execution. I got really upset when they told me that I was a criminal. I got offended. Sadly I will have to pay for what I did. Maybe Genevieve will someday forgive me. Just not today.

I sit on the chair and think about Genevieve. *I'm going to join you so you will never feel lonely in the paradise!,* I whisper. I know she can hear me from up there and I'm sure I heard her cry before I started shaking and died painfully.

*Hello, Genevieve! You missed me? Look what I've got you! Isn't it cute? Genevieve? Genevieve please!*

&#x200B;

*I love you, Genevieve.*

*We went trought a really romantic story together. A story about true love. I love you.*

*Don't cry, Genevieve.*

*Don't cry, we will be happy together. I love you. Don't be upset.*
