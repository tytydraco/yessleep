I am a scavenger that lived with my aunt and cousin in the houses you can find just next to the city dumps, that's where I grew up, between the trash, just another home made of plastic walls and cardboard roofs. 

 

Every morning you can hear how since early the garbage trucks start to arrive bringing mountains of new trash, people from the city probably have no idea of the amount of trash that is disposed daily, and here I was on my own daily routine climbing this mountains looking for recyclable waste and I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else because this has always been my life, but that morning between all that trash I found the artifact.

I saw it from far away and it caught my attention because of how clean and shiny it looked in between the normal putrefied food you could see everywhere around, there it was clean and intact by everything that surrounded it,like an item that didn't belong here.I left everything I was collecting and went directly to get it before someone else could see it, since the first moment I touched it, I could feel this strange transfer of energy that caused my legs to feel debilitated and I remember that I felt down laying in the trash without any care because of the feeling of joy and satisfaction that I had never felt before.

It felt like a wooden object with sharp edges but it didn't seem to be capable of cutting you, it was such a delicate object that it now belonged to me.

I couldn't understand how something of such value could end up in a place like this. At that moment I decided to finish my daily activities even though the day was just starting, I climbed down the trash mountain and return back home where I could be alone since my aunt and cousin would be collecting trash the whole day. 

I rushed into my room that was just an area separated by a blanket, I layed down on the floor and I started to analyze the artifact, it was so smooth but heavy and you could feel this warmth coming out of it and filling you with tranquility, once covered completely with this sensation it felt like if I was getting transported to a different place were there was no colors or weight, were there was no other feeling but a sense of completeness, like if you were falling slowly knowing you will never land anywhere

I felt not that much time had passed when my cousin entered the room and took me out of the sensation which caused me to explode in anger for terminating the effect, but I managed to control myself, I felt disoriented when I realized it was already getting dark outside, I had spent hours here that had felt like seconds, I hide the artifact under the mattress and went out to walk to distract myself

I passed the other houses from people that mostly dedicated themselves to trash recollection like we do but you could also find all type of things around here, there was even people that would keep animals in their yards like chickens, doves, dogs, pigs and all type of little mountains of trash you could also find in the yards.

I walked a few blocks until I arrived into a little shopping mall were I thought I could walk and distract me for some time, but just as I was arriving I noticed this black car that was following me and inside of it there was a couple of old people, I didn't worry much about it, but it turn very clear that they were following me and suddenly from inside the car they started to make hand gestures at me indicating they wanted to talk with me,I stopped at the side of the road, they had a driver and I don't know much about card but theirs looked expensive.

From inside the car this really old man came out and started walking with difficulty towards me. The old woman stayed inside the car and was fixed looking at me, first I tried to pretend I was not looking at her but when our eyes crossed she gave me this big fake smile.

The old men walk around the car until he caught up with me, he mentioned his name and stretch his hand, I did not pay any attention to his name since it sounded strange and I immediately forgot it,I suspected them following me had something to do with the artifact I found because why would there be any other reason to follow me if I never had anything of value in my possession

He told me with a light smile that he knew I had the artifact because he could see how my aura was putrefying, I tried to look confused at what he was saying trying to show I didn't knew anything about this artifact, I started saying I didn't knew what he was talking about but he violently told me to shut up, the expression in his face changed immediately and the way he carried his body transformed from this fragile old man to this strong violent and dark person.

He told me he knew I had found it.

\-Don't worry about it you can keep it, i'm not here to take it from you, but he also told me I had to be careful

\-I can tell you what you are going to go through, first you will feel is yours and there is nothing in the world that can take it from you, but very soon you will lose everything you have to it,he noticed how my expression changed acknowledging I had the artifact

 

\-You will feed from them but they will feed from what you have, they will devour you, said with a smile, he extended his hand and deliver me a piece of paper with his phone number

\-We can teach you a lot of things and to tell you the truth we could use young blood in our aging group, I took the paper and he started to walk back to his car, I stayed quiet seeing how they moved away from me, the old lady did a gesture of goodbye now with a genuine smile expecting they will see me again, I did the goodbye gesture and they left.

It seems he only spoke to me to affirm his suspicions and I kept thinking how such a precious artifact could have ended in the garbage dump?.

 I came back running, I passed the other homes nearby and finally arrived at my aunt's house.

When I entered the room I saw that my cousin had the artifact in his hands, he had his eyes opened but completely black and he remained seated and talking words I couldn't understand, on the other side of the room my aunt was lying unconscious on the floor, I felt scared and I pushed my cousin trying to make him react, this made him wake up and the artifact fell to the floor, I immediately took it and hide it from his sight behind me, he was coming out of his state looking all around trying to find it, he was staring at me directly because he knew I had taken it from him and I was talking to him but he did not react, like he was not in full control of his body yet.

He remained with an empty stare for some more seconds and then without any warning he threw himself to me trying to strangle me yelling at me that he wanted it back,He started screaming louder and louder and I could see my aunt waking up looking directly at the artifact behind me, she got closer and closer until he took it from me, my cousin when he saw this started to slowly let me go almost like possessed by something, he saw how my aunt was hugging the artifact when he launch himself to her, they started fighting for it, like if their lives depend on having it they were using more and more force against the other one, when I saw the opportunity I took it from them and went running out of the house.

I could hear them running behind me, both of them throwing insults at me when they realized they would not be able to catch me.

I understood at that moment how dangerous the artifact was and how no one else should ever touch it but me, for a moment I thought of even throwing it back on the trash after seeing what it had done to my family, but before anything I decided I should pass at least one more time alone with it and feel that warmth and that sense of completeness that I had never felt before,

The next day I took the only money that I had in my pocket and decided I was going to spend the whole day in a motel by myself with my artifact.

Time passed so fast when I was under his influence, I just stared at it and I could feel how he was staring back at me and I was finally pleased having this feeling of not wanting anything else in my life because I had now more that what I could ever had dream of, I was satisfied with myself and with what I was and in that moment I didn't care about anything else.

Hours and hours went by and what it felt like seconds was actually a whole day that had passed, and something I had to accept is that this time around it felt less intense that the first time

I was now worried about my family after all they were the only people that cared about me and I hoped to go back and find them in a better state than the last time I saw them, maybe I could negotiate with them and share the artifact between the 3 of us and if it didn't work out I wouldn't care because I just needed more money to spend more time alone with it, this was the only thing I really cared about

When I entered the garbage dump area I started to have a strange feeling about being there, it felt like it was darker than usual and more quiet, when I got closer to the homes I could see some of the neighbors looking through the windows and multiple animals running around because some of the fences where thrown down, you could see dogs, chickens and other animals running free and I started having this strange feeling like if I was being followed but I couldn't see anyone around.

When I got closer to my home I could hear people screaming inside but I could not understand what they were saying, I felt scare because I noticed the sounds came from inside the house but I couldn't recognize the voices, I ran faster and I could see through the transparent plastic wall at my cousin sitting on top of my aunt strangling her, he was yelling with such violence that you could see the saliva dripping from his mouth, I ran and try to throw him off, I pushed him and threw him against the floor, he started laughing hysterically and didn't seem to do much of an effort to push me away, my aunt stood up and ran from the house yelling that my cousin was possessed and that he tried to kill her, she told me she was going to get some help and then I could see my cousin closing his eyes and just fell unconscious to the floor, and I heard outside my aunt yelling and calling desperately for help

.

I stood up and went out as fast as I could, it was very dark so I couldn't see anything apart from the white light coming out of my home, I kept walking and I saw what was happening but I couldn't comprehend it, far away I could see my aunt in the floor facing down with his arms stretched trying to force herself out of this giant pig that already had her whole legs in his mouth, it was consuming her and it seem like he wanted to get the whole body in, she was using all his force trying to liberate herself, screaming as loud as she could asking for help but she was loosing and very quickly she just stopped moving ,and I could see how she was being devoured completely.

I turned around and I saw my cousin coming out of the house, I foolishly asked him to come and help me free my aunt, but I immediately saw when he was getting closer to me that he had a kitchen knife and looked like he was going to use it, I then remembered what the old man said to me and I started running, I didn't look back but I could hear he was following me.

I ran into the dark until I got to the mountains of trash and in there it was very easy to hide, the smell was terrible but I had learned to tolerate it, I hide in between the garbage and felt relief when I noticed I had the artifact with me.That was the only thing that matter

I fell asleep in there and when the sunrise started to happen I got out and ran opposite to the direction of the house, I decided I was never going to return to that place.

I left the city and I am now back in a motel, I have been moving around finding little jobs or asking for money on the streets, i'm not interested in food anymore and I have seen how my body is decomposing in life, every day feeling weaker and weaker, I lost the only family I had so there is nothing else I could lose.

I don't know what happened with my cousin, maybe he is looking for me or for my artifact, sometimes I think I should visit the old man from the car since I still have his address and phone number but not now, because now i'm alone again in a motel room and I feel so thankful of having found this artifact, I have never been this happy in my life as right now.
