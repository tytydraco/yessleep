Hello everyone at r/nosleep.

My name matters less than the story I need to tell. I am one of the few in my village, here deep in the green heart of the Amazon, who has sporadic access to the internet. I learned your language from outsiders, missionaries and researchers who passed through here, and curiosity has led me to many corners [of the web], including this subreddit. 

I read your stories about strange rules, about creatures in the darkness, about urban terrors. Some give me chills. It's funny to think about our cultural difference. Around here, we are, in a way, 'acclimatized' to fear, as you might say. For us, what you call 'paranormal' or 'supernatural' is just part of the world.

We grew up hearing stories, warnings, lessons passed down by our elders about respect, about boundaries. We know the signs, the sacred places and the cursed ones. Since I was a child, I learned there are places one must not fish after sunset, trees that cannot be cut even when dead, and sounds that must never be imitated. The sounds of the forest change completely after the sun goes down. It's not just the crickets or the frogs. There are snaps of branches no animal would make, whispers the wind carries for kilometers.

The white people think "paranormal" is something separate, an intrusion. For us, it's like the air: it's in everything. The spirits are neighbours. The child who gets lost in the igarapé might return speaking the language of the dead, and this isn't tragedy – it's a lesson. The elders teach us to "read" the forest. The way the leaves fall, the colour of the water after a heavy rain, the sudden silence of the monkeys – all of this has meaning.

But even though I am so different from you, I fear we are all condemned for having become too much alike.

Our people, despite living in the forest and keeping our traditions, our language, our customs, knows about the white man. You gave us technology. Our young people are sent to the city to study. They become literate in the “official” language. We share our history with your researchers; your professors come to our villages to do research; your anthropologists are used to interviewing us. The media makes documentaries about us and interviews our warriors. We are like cousins to you. One side has grown accustomed to the other. 

But you need to know that not everyone is like this.

You call them 'the isolated'. The white man's government says it protects their lands, creating zones where no outsider can enter. Thousands of kilometers of dense forest that no one, not even the police or the army, truly knows. Instead of trying to study them, perhaps decipher their language, their culture, the government decided simply to protect them. And watch, from afar. 

This might have been the first mistake. 

Their existence is a fact for us, like an unknown river or a distant mountain in the mist. But we do not understand their languages. The rare sounds the wind sometimes carries from their direction do not resemble any speech we know. Their tracks, when found by chance near the unspoken boundaries, are different. Their beliefs? Their fears? Their guardian spirits? They are mysteries to us, just as much as they are to you. They are peoples whose true names the world has never heard.

We coexist with these peoples. But it's a coexistence of distance and silence. The rule of not entering their territories isn't just for the outsiders who venture here; it applies to us too. For centuries, the instruction was clear: upon hearing their peculiar calls in the forest, upon seeing tracks that are not ours or those of known animals, there is no curiosity. We lower our heads and silently change our course. 

They are the peoples we avoid. But this invisible barrier, this abyss of silence between us… it feels as though it is erected with the same firmness from their side. It's not the skittish shyness of a forest creature fleeing when seen. It's something intentional. The birds fall silent in a strange way, the sound dies in a wrong way, a silence so absolute it almost sounds like a suppressed scream. That is how we know we are already at the border between our territories, and it's time to turn back.

But of course, it's not always like that. No one is born knowing which steps to avoid, which shadows to ignore. When childhood curiosity leads a little one to point towards that denser part of the woods, or to imitate a strange sound coming from afar, the reaction isn't a legend, not a monster story. It's a sudden silence from the adults around, a stern look that permits no questions, a firm but silent pull on the arm, drawing them away. The question 'Why?' dies on the lips before it's even fully formed. Children learn not by the name of the danger, but by the heavy feeling that emanates from the elders whenever that invisible boundary is even mentioned.

But try to ask, as a child inevitably does, ‘Grandfather, why did your face get like that when I spoke of the different signs near the dark igarapé?'. The answer doesn't come in words. It comes in a sudden stiffness in the elder's shoulders, in a gaze that abruptly shifts to the fire or the ground. The pajés [shamans] are supposed to have all the answers about the forest, but in that moment, the child learns there are things that have no name in the pajés' stories. Things they have decided to ignore and look away from.

And so we lived for centuries. Our peoples on one side, those peoples on the other. Not even colonization changed this. While entire tribes were burned by the colonizer, while Catholic Jesuits dominated and learned our language and the languages of our sister tribes, they remained there. Isolated. Uncontacted. Oblivious to the oppressor's sword. Looking back, I think we should have paid more attention to this. It's not a natural phenomenon. Now, perhaps, it's too late.

It started two days ago, well after the last fire had burned down to embers. 

That's when we heard it. Coming not from afar, as we were used to, but disturbingly close. Not the incomprehensible calls we had each grown accustomed to hearing throughout our lives, but grotesque imitations of sounds. Our sounds. A fragment vaguely resembling the cry of a village baby, but repeated in an unnatural cycle, devoid of emotion. Another sound seemed like a failed attempt to echo the slow rhythm of a shamanic chant, but off-key, broken, as if the very throat producing it didn't understand the melody or purpose. 

It was as if something was dissecting our sounds and trying to reassemble them with the wrong pieces. It seemed less an attempt to 'speak' and more a vocal spasm, a desperate need to expel noise, any noise. It lasted for hours. For brief moments, amidst the chaos, we heard what could have been an attempt at voice. Not words. Tonal fragments, as if something were trying to reproduce the cadence of human speech after hearing it only once, from very far away, distorted by wind and water. 

They were meaningless rising and falling modulations, interrupted by choking sounds or chitinous clicks. It wasn't a message. It wasn't a threat we understood. It was a chaotic outpouring. A leak of sounds from a place where logic does not reside. It was the pure audible manifestation of a desperate need to do… something, anything, to be perceived, but without the slightest idea how. We spent the entire night awake, huddled in our hammocks, the air thick with fear and the smoke from fires relit uselessly against an enemy that didn't show itself, only sounded. The night was no longer ours.

The air in the village wasn't just heavy; it felt toxic. No one spoke a word. The pajés, for the first time in anyone's memory, seemed shrunken, their eyes fixed on the ground as if afraid of finding something in the emptiness. That one night felt like days. But the worst was yet to come.

In the deepest hour of the night, when even the moon dared not peek and the darkness was a palpable weight, the very nature of the noises began to change. And then, peering through the tiny cracks in the walls of our ocas [huts], terror took shape. The sounds had also become shapes, an agglomeration of shadows darker than the night itself. 

They were not the forest spirits we know, nor animals. They were many. And then we could see… more. Their outlines were fluid, erratic, sometimes seeming almost human in silhouette, at other times unfolding at impossible angles, with limbs that appeared to bend in the wrong places. Their mouths moved, and the horrible sounds we'd heard before – the clicks, the wet sobs, the broken static – emanated directly from them, a parody of speech so grotesque it turned the stomach. Counting them was impossible; the darkness and fear blurred our vision.

But the true abyss opened when we focused on their faces, or what seemed to be their faces. There was no anger, no hatred, no enemy's bloodlust. There was… agony. Masks contorted in unspeakable suffering, and from their eyes – or the dark cavities where eyes should have been – trickled thick, dark, almost oily streaks. 

It was weeping. Unmistakable. The universal language of human pain, coming from beings that seemed anything but human. But why were they crying? Why were they lamenting? Were they mourning our imminent death, even before touching us? Dread paralyzed us in our hammocks, not just from fear of physical pain, but from the nauseating realization: we were witnessing, perhaps even unwillingly participating in, an event of incomprehensible sorrow with no record or precedent in human history.

That profane vigil stretched on for hours that felt like ages, drawn out in the torture of anticipation. 

But the attack never came. There was no movement towards us, no arrow fired, no step crossing the invisible line that separated us. And perhaps that was worse: their faces turned towards us, or maybe through us, in a concentration of suffering so intense it held us pinned in place. Every member of the tribe remained frozen in their oca, breathing as little as possible. The initial fear of a massacre gave way to a different kind of terror: the dread of the incomprehensible, the feeling of being observed, judged, and mourned by beings operating outside any natural or spiritual law we knew.

The night dragged on, dense and starless. The lament continued, a constant, sickening pulse that seemed to reorder the very silence between its waves. And then, almost imperceptibly, a subtle change began. Not in them, but in the world around. A pale, sickly gray began to seep into the eastern edge of the sky, the first hesitant promise of dawn. The lament didn't stop abruptly; it began to unravel, losing its cohesion, the sounds breaking into even more erratic fragments, before finally being swallowed by the growing gray of morning. The dark shapes seemed to retreat, not like an army withdrawing, but like the darkness itself dissolving, receding into the depths of the forest from which they came, leaving behind a heavy silence. 

We waited, motionless, for a long time after the last sound died out and the last flickering shadow disappeared. The sun was already high, burning the sky at midday, before the first of us truly dared to emerge. Only then, one by one, slowly, with the caution of someone treading on mined earth, did we begin to emerge from our shelters into a world that looked familiar, but which we knew, in our bones, had been irrevocably profaned.

The village was silent, except for the almost aggressive buzz of diurnal insects. 

There was no discussion, no meeting of the elders. The first to crawl out of their ocas didn't look at each other; their eyes went instinctively to the small structure of wood and tin that housed our tenuous link to the outside world: the shortwave radio and the satellite internet terminal, gifts from the government after the last bloody conflicts with loggers. 

Without a word, Kael and Tari, two of the youngest trained in the codes and protocols, ran inside. The nervous crackle of static filled the air as Kael tried to establish contact with the military border control base. His voice, usually firm, was a trembling thread: "Jaguatirica Base, this is Ypykuéra, code Red Herald!" 

There was a loaded silence on the other end, likely shock or disbelief, but the code Arauto Vermelho [Red Herald], reserved for existential threats or unexplained large-scale incursions near the Zones of Protection for the Isolated, prevented any doubt about the seriousness of our distress call.

The response took what felt like a lifetime, but by the clock was just under two tense hours, lived under a relentless sun and a heavy silence broken only by stifled sobs and the anxious murmurs of the elders. Each cloud shadow made hearts leap; each twig snap in the woods sounded like the nightmare's return. Then, a distant sound, a vibration felt more in the chest than heard, began to grow. It became a deep hum. 

Three military transport helicopters, enormous green-metal dragonflies, broke the treeline in tactical formation. They made a low pass over the village, the downdraft whipping leaves and dust into a violent whirlwind, before beginning a coordinated descent into the central clearing. The noise was deafening, a storm of metal and wind that drowned out all other sounds. Even before they fully touched the ground, the side ramps opened, and soldiers equipped for jungle combat – camouflage, vests, helmets with dark visors, assault rifles ready – began to disembark with trained efficiency. There were dozens. They quickly formed a defensive perimeter, not looking at us, but towards the forest, towards the dark line from where the horror had emerged and where it had retreated.

While the soldiers established the perimeter, weapons at low ready but eyes scanning the treeline, a figure emerged from the third helicopter, the command aircraft. Without the impersonal helmet, without the tense combat stance, we saw a face many of us recognized instantly. It was Commander Galvão. For almost twenty years, he had been the face of the Army in our region, a man whose patrols and training exercises were part of the landscape, whose sporadic visits to check borders or mediate minor conflicts were almost routine. 

Galvão was procedure, order, the guarantee that the gears of the outside world were now engaged. But there was something in his posture, in the almost satisfied glint in his eyes as he surveyed his men's show of force, that soon caught the attention of the most observant. We knew how it worked: protecting Indigenous lands, especially responding quickly to a distress call like ours, earned points with the government in Brasília. Showed results. Perhaps for Galvão, we were just providing him an opportunity to look competent, ready to burn tractors or arrest loggers.

When those most skilled in the Portuguese language began to recount the events – the profane sounds imitating our lives, the fluid, weeping shadows that surrounded us, the lament that seemed a funeral for our own existence – Galvão's expression changed. The confident smile vanished, but it wasn't replaced by the horror or empathetic urgency we expected. His eyes took on a glint of... apathy? Polished impatience? He listened intently, head tilted, like a doctor listening to the description of a fever dream. 

He listened with formal attention, occasionally nodding to the FUNAI [Govt. Indigenous Affairs Agency] advisor beside him, as if they were comparing mental notes on some obscure tribal phenomenon. The officer was processing, filtering the information through his grid of known threats: guerillas? Smugglers using psychological intimidation tactics? A rival tribe? Nothing fit.

At the end of Tari's account, Galvão stroked his chin, his gaze lost for a moment in the green vastness. "I understand," he said finally, his voice calm, but with a tone that sought to reduce the extraordinary to the manageable. "Atypical situation, no doubt." He turned to the Pajé, a calculated gesture of respect.

"Don't you think that maybe… just maybe… they've finally decided to learn to plant something around here, like you do?"

We saw the naked truth then: the Brazilian Army, with its helicopters, its rifles, and its satellites, was prepared to face guerrillas, traffickers, loggers, even a foreign invasion force or insistent missionaries. But it was not prepared for that.

"Right," he said, his voice pragmatic. "The situation is clearly abnormal and your account is troubling. Alpha Platoon, maintain the perimeter and conduct a careful sweep within a three-hundred-meter radius of the village. Document any unusual traces – footprints, objects, markings. Photograph everything. But maximum attention:" he raised a finger, emphatic. "No, I repeat, NO initiative to follow tracks beyond this initial area or attempt visual contact if anything is sighted. The orders from Brasília and FUNAI regulations regarding the non-contact policy with isolated groups are absolute. Our job here is to ensure the safety of this contacted village and gather preliminary information for the report. We will not initiate a conflict or a health crisis through recklessness." 

His explanation was direct, operational. The Army was there to contain the immediate situation in our village, not to hunt ghosts in the forest.

The FUNAI representative, whose badge identified him as the acting regional coordinator, cleared his throat, looking equally overwhelmed but adhering to protocol. "The Commander is correct. We must follow procedures." He addressed us, his tone more conciliatory, yet still distant. 

"Our priority now is your well-being. We will arrange for a multidisciplinary team, and you should describe everything to them in as much detail as possible. It would also be important," he added, glancing around at the tense faces, "to conduct a preventative health assessment here in the village as soon as possible, to rule out any risk, however indirect." He gestured vaguely towards the forest. "As for… these entities… we will request analysis of recent satellite imagery of the area to try and identify unusual movement patterns or unregistered camps. If there are physical traces nearby, we can collect samples for analysis." He hesitated. "Regarding the sounds… installing recording equipment is possible, but requires planning and resources that must be approved. And even then, linguistic analysis of unknown material is a long, uncertain process. But if we record something, we can consult neighbouring ethnic groups to see if they recognize the language or have histories of conflict/communication with the isolated group." 

Galvão intervened, ending the conversation. "Let's make a report now. The Amazon Military Command will be notified today, along with FUNAI headquarters. They will decide the next steps and the allocation of additional resources, if deemed necessary." He glanced at his watch. "We will certainly have measures in place within a few weeks."

Weeks. 

The word echoed in the silence that followed, cold and inadequate. The white man's world, with its reports, requests, and response times, seemed dangerously disconnected from the night of horror we had just survived and the palpable fear that it would repeat in a few hours. Help had arrived, but it was already leaving. 

At that moment, one of the tribe's elders, not the oldest, nor the wisest, but the one who found the courage to break the silence, stepped forward, his hands trembling slightly. "Commander," his voice was low but charged with desperate urgency. "With all respect to your orders… they are not loggers. They don't follow laws. You saw our faces. You heard our accounts. They were here. You cannot… you cannot leave us alone tonight."

Galvão barely waited for the elder to finish his sentence.

“I understand your concern. Truly. But my orders are clear, and my jurisdiction is limited. There is, at this moment," he gestured to the silent forest, "no physical evidence of an imminent threat that justifies leaving a permanent detachment here. We have other areas to patrol, other demands. Resources are limited." He paused, perhaps noticing the absolute desperation in our eyes. "What I can guarantee is this: we will keep a dedicated radio channel open directly with my base, 24 hours. Any… I repeat, any sign of return of the activity you described, use the Red Herald code immediately. We will have a rapid response team on standby.”

Four hours later, the perimeter sweep was completed. No traces or materials were found. At 16:58 [4:58 PM], we watched, powerless, as the soldiers climbed back into the flying machines, their heavy boots marking our sacred ground one last time. The helicopters lifted, raising another storm of dust and leaves, then moved away, becoming ever smaller dots in the indifferent blue sky, until only the tense silence and the buzz of insects remained. 

They were gone. And night was coming. The abyss between our world and theirs had never seemed so vast, and we were left on the wrong side, alone.

While the elders began to murmur ancient prayers and check the makeshift fastenings on the ocas, the eyes of the younger ones turned again to the small communications hut. In recent years, many men and women from the city had come to us – professors, researchers, students with their notebooks and recorders, curious about our stories, our plants, our language. Some had shown genuine respect, a more attentive ear than the officials. With fingers flying over the satellite terminal keyboard, a frantic search began for names, for emails, saved phone numbers, sending short, urgent messages, fragments of the horror we lived through, appeals for any kind of guidance or help that didn't involve waiting weeks for a report.

One of the first lines dialed returned the call 30 minutes later. It was Leandro, an ethnohistory professor from a federal university, a man who had spent months with us years ago, mapping our oral narratives. 

His call was short, direct: he was doing fieldwork with another riverside community, some two hundred kilometers from us by river – far, but perhaps not impossibly far. The university would never arrange transport in the necessary time or circumstances, but he offered help if we could find a way to bring him here. 

A new wave of urgency took hold. Kael picked up the radio again, his voice firmer this time, calling Galvão's frequency. He explained the situation, the professor's offer, the need for an air pickup to bring him to us. On the other end, Galvão's response came with an alacrity bordering on enthusiasm. 

"A civilian expert? Who already knows you? Excellent!" There was almost palpable relief in his voice. "I can divert a smaller helicopter returning to base. Give me his exact coordinates. Consider it done. It's good to have an academic on-site to evaluate this… complex cultural situation. Keep me informed." The ease with which he agreed confirmed our suspicions: for Galvão, this wasn't just help; it was a convenient transfer of an incomprehensible and troublesome problem into someone else's hands. But, at that moment, it didn't matter. A new, fragile hope was on its way.

The small helicopter returned perhaps an hour before the sun began to dip behind the tallest trees, its singular sound less oppressive but charged with a different expectation. From the open door descended Leandro, his familiar face marked by the fatigue of the hurried journey and a genuine concern that contrasted sharply with Galvão's detached efficiency. But he hadn't come alone. Behind him followed two other men, also dressed in the practical, worn clothes of those who spend more time in the field than in offices. 

Leandro introduced us to Carlos, a linguist with a sharp gaze that seemed to analyze even our silence, and Rafael, a historian whose specialty was precisely the gaps in history, the peoples and events left out of official records. They had been together on a survey in a community several hours away by boat, documenting traditions dying with the elders. These men gave up their rest, their return to their families in the city, moved by something the Commander might not fully understand: a mix of academic duty, the irresistible pull of the unknown, and the solidarity forged over years of working alongside the peoples of the forest.

While the soldiers had brought brute force and rigid protocols, Leandro and his team brought equipment of a different nature: high-sensitivity recorders, cameras with night vision capability, directional microphones, extra batteries, waterproof notebooks. They listened to our account again, not with apathy or skepticism, but with focused intensity, asking precise questions. To them, the contact attempt by an isolated group in that manner – not fleeting, but invasive, ritualistic, charged with alien emotion – was a seismic event, something challenging everything known or theorized.

They recognized the sanctity of the non-contact rule, the need not to cross the border. But they also understood that if the border was breached again by them, by those entities of the night, the world needed to know. It had to be recorded – their images, their incomprehensible voices. And, amidst the backpacks of recording equipment, there was something else, unpacked discreetly but without apology: two tranquilizer dart pistols, the kind used by veterinarians and biologists to safely sedate large animals, and a few stun grenades, which produce intense light and loud sound to disorient. 

Not the soldiers' weapons of war, but tools from their own experience in the deep forest, useful perhaps against dangers they understood – a cornered jaguar, maybe, or an unexpected encounter with invaders. As Rafael checked the mechanism of one dart pistol, the soft click echoing strangely, I saw our Pajé lower his gaze to the ground, while another nearby elder briefly closed his eyes, an almost inaudible sigh escaping his lips. They said nothing. They didn't need to. It was the same silent language used when a child asks a question that shouldn't be answered: a tacit acknowledgment that, while they respected the professors' intent, they knew in their spirits that darts and bright lights might be like throwing pebbles into the fog against the shadows that wept.

With the sunlight fading fast, painting the sky orange and purple over the canopy, a new dynamic settled over the village. Leandro, Carlos, and Rafael worked with quiet efficiency, positioning their equipment at strategic points. Sensitive microphones were mounted on unobtrusive tripods, aimed at the forest edge like attentive ears; night-vision cameras, small red eyes blinking in the twilight, were fixed to makeshift posts, scanning the approaches to the clearing. There was a professionalism in their movements, but also a restrained tension. 

They spoke in low voices, trading hypotheses – perhaps a rare acoustic phenomenon, mass hysteria induced by some unknown environmental factor, or, the most intriguing and dangerous possibility, a genuinely unexplained manifestation of the isolated peoples. While their scientific minds might doubt the oily tears and shifting shapes, they did not doubt the genuine terror in our eyes, nor the magnitude of what such an event represented: any unilateral breaking of the silence by an uncontacted group was a historic and potentially catastrophic occurrence. They needed data, evidence.

As darkness swallowed the village, the plan for the night was set. Kael, with his knowledge of technology and the nervous courage of youth, volunteered to stay in the satellite hut, our only fast link to the outside world – and to Galvão's promise of rapid return. He took one of the researchers' walkie-talkies with him, the antenna extended. Leandro kept the other, a direct but fragile link across the dark distance between the isolated hut and the village center where he'd set up his observation post. 

"Anything, Kael," Leandro said, his voice firm but his eyes betraying apprehension. "Any strange noise, any movement on the cameras I might miss from here, anything out of the ordinary… call immediately." The constant hum of the recorders was a counterpoint to the night sounds beginning to stir – the chorus of insects, the croaking of frogs, sounds that the previous night had been precursors to horror. That night, no one would close their eyes. The elders prayed quietly in their hammocks, while the researchers checked connections and batteries, each immersed in their own tense vigil, all waiting, heart tight, for what the forest would bring when the darkness was complete.

The hours dragged by on that second night, each minute an eternity. Outside, the forest breathed, but the familiar sounds seemed distorted by our apprehension. Leandro, Carlos, and Rafael kept watch in one of the larger ocas, the camera monitors casting a ghostly glow on tense faces, headphones capturing every amplified crackle or whisper. The coffee pot was long empty. Our women and elders murmured prayers in low voices, a fragile counterpoint to the researchers' technology. 

Kael, in the satellite hut, broke the radio silence every fifteen or twenty minutes: "This is Kael. Nothing at my position. How about there, Professor?" Leandro's reply was always the same: "All quiet here, Kael. Cameras clear. Recorders registering only… the night." But with each call, Kael's voice seemed a little tighter, Leandro's a little more weary.

It was 2:45 AM when the tension snapped. A low beep sounded from Carlos's laptop, a red square flashing over the icon for Camera 4 – the one watching the northwest sector, near the forbidden trail to the igarapé. Everyone's breath caught. Eyes fixed on the grainy, greenish image from the night vision.

It was Kael.

He was outside the communications hut, walking in slow circles near the edge of the trees. But something was terribly wrong. He didn't look scared or alert. His head was tilted towards the invisible sky. His face, when the camera briefly caught it up close, was contorted in a wide smile, almost a grimace, and his lips moved rhythmically, as if telling a long, silent joke to the stars. 

An icy dread swept through the oca. Was he... laughing? A silent, continuous laugh. Kael's mother, in the same hut as us, let out a muffled sob. "He wouldn't do that… he's afraid…" Leandro grabbed the walkie-talkie. "Kael! Kael, copy? What's going on out there?" Only static answered. An error beep from the radio display confirmed: No Signal. Out of Range. But he was right there, less than a hundred meters away, laughing alone at the darkness.

A thick, horrible silence fell over the hut, broken only by Kael's mother's quiet weeping. No one knew what to do. Then Rafael, the historian, acted on impulse. "He's not well! It could be a psychotic break from the fear, we have to help him!" He grabbed one of the tranquilizer dart pistols, pushed open the woven palm door, and ran into the night. 

"Rafael, wait!" yelled Leandro, snatching the other radio and a powerful flashlight, rushing after his colleague. "Carlos, lock the door! Monitor everything! We'll be right back!" 

All of us – Carlos, and the terrified villagers – were glued to the monitor. We saw Leandro reach Rafael near Kael's hut. We saw Kael turn towards them, still wearing that wide, wrong smile, and begin to… sing? A low, guttural sound, in no language we knew. Then, with sudden, unnatural agility, he turned and ran, not towards the village, but into the dense darkness of the forbidden woods, disappearing from the camera's view. 

Leandro and Rafael hesitated for an instant, then followed him. Their flashlight beams danced among the trees and vanished.

Only the audio remained. We could hear Kael's strange, guttural song, now more distant. And then, the horror solidified.

A second voice joined his, hesitant at first, then stronger. It was Rafael's voice. A few seconds later, the third voice, Leandro's. All three were singing together now. But it was no longer Kael's guttural sound. It was a complex, polyphonic chant, full of dissonant harmony and a deep, almost geological sorrow. 

The words were impossible, full of clicks and guttural pops, but undeniably sung with a hideous mix of agony and ecstasy. We heard laughter mixing with sobs within that alien song. Carlos tried to go after them, but the strongest men of the village held him back, their eyes wide with ancestral terror. 

"Don't go! We cannot lose another one!"

That profane chorus continued through the predawn hours, seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere, until, just like the night before, it began to unravel and fade with the first pale rays of dawn. 

No one slept. No one moved until the sun was high in the sky.

When the clock in the hut struck eight in the morning, the elders finally nodded. Carlos, myself, and a few other young men went out, armed with machetes and fear. 

We searched around the hut, on the trail, at the edge of the woods. Nothing. Silence. It was Tari, who had gone straight to the communications hut to check the terminal, who let out a high-pitched scream that cut the air like a blade. We ran there.

Lying on the packed dirt floor, in a tight, unnatural embrace, were Kael, Leandro, and Rafael. Their eyes were open, glazed, and on their faces… a smile. Wide, serene, almost happy. They were cold. Dead. 

On the computer monitor, the satellite call program screen showed Galvão's number, dialed repeatedly, the connection never completed.

Later, the Army medical team, arriving with Galvão less than an hour after our new, desperate call, would determine the cause of death: all three, simultaneously, had suffered a massive myocardial infarction. A collective heart attack, in the dark of the forest, while smiling.

That was last night. 

It is now 15:46 [3:46 PM] the next day. The news of the deaths of two university professors and an Indigenous man, found embraced and smiling, spread like wildfire through the white man's world. Except in the media, somehow. 

But our village is no longer ours. It is full of uniforms, white coats, people with badges and blinking equipment. Federal Police, the Army in full force, Galvão's entire team, medical examiners, psychologists, and even that organization they call the Cacique Cobra Coral Foundation, whose members watch everything in silence, with eyes I cannot decipher, are here. 

More than three hundred strangers here, setting up tents, analyzing every leaf, every recording, using machines they say can think to decipher the sounds of last night. Galvão's relief is gone, replaced by a grim mask of concern and curt orders.

But night is coming again. The birds are quiet today, in a way I do not like. Tari doesn't speak, just weeps quietly in a corner. 

They – the white men in charge – chose me. They asked me to stay in the communications hut tonight. They gave me a vest, a camera on my chest that they say transmits everything live to a command room in Brasília and to someplace called langley, via a new antenna they put up in a hurry. They gave me a dart pistol. They say I am the 'first line of observation'.

I know what that means. I know I am going to die tonight. They don't tell me what they've found out, but I am the only one here who understands their language when they speak quietly, thinking no one is listening. I heard one of the Foundation men talking to Galvão on the radio just now. His voice was calm, cold. He said: "Yesterday, same time frame, an alert came via Interpol. An anthropology team in New Guinea made an emergency contact. A local uncontacted group surrounded their camp. 

They were… weeping”.
