Last year I had a Thanksgiving I'll never forget. I've grown up in the inner city for most of my life. I moved into the suburbs after graduation and I live with my roommate. Most of my extended family lives out in the country. While I can certainly see the appeal, it just isn't for me in the long term.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My uncle lived with his wife and two of my cousins on a farm. Every year, who was the host would change. It was a four-hour drive when I reached his place. I was there early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Marv," he greeted upon opening the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pulled me into a hug.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Boy, it is good to see you."

&#x200B;

"You too, Teddy."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His actual name is Theodore. However, due to him usually being a big softy, he's gotten that nickname.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I brought something."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I held up a wrapped dish of brownies. His eyes lit up upon seeing them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Man, these look good. You make them?”

&#x200B;

“No, my roommate did. I tried to talk him into coming up here, but he wanted to spend it with his family.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why he did,  I have no clue. From what he’s told me about them, his family sounds like the most obnoxious people you can be around. I only ever met his brother and sister. The former was a constantly drunk asshole and the latter made me want to rip my hair out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, it’s gonna be a bit before everyone gets here so come on in and make yourself at home.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I  put my coat on the rack and closed the door behind me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So, do you want me to help with anything?”

&#x200B;

“We got it covered. Just say hi to Selma.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That would be my aunt-in-law. She married into the family when I was twelve so she’s been part of it for a while now.  If I  had to describe her, imagine if southern hospitality was a person. I found her doing some cooking. Her apron was smeared with flour. She smiled wide when I stepped into the kitchen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Marvin,” she said, hugging me, “it has been too long. How are you?”

&#x200B;

“I’m doing good. I brought something.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I held up the brownies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“A friend of mine made them.”

&#x200B;

“These look great. We have a dessert table set up so just put them there. By the way, how are your folks? Do you know if they’re coming?”

&#x200B;

“Oh, I wouldn’t know. We haven’t talked in a while.”

&#x200B;

“Really? That’s a shame.  It’s been a long time since we’ve seen them.”

&#x200B;

“Well, you never know. They might turn up. Anyway, I’m going to say hi to April and Jamie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Those would be my cousins. I came into the living room as they were coming downstairs. We greeted each other and talked for a bit. Eventually, other members of the family arrived. Much to my surprise and apprehension, my parents decided to show up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yeah, we hadn’t been on great terms for the past months. Long story short, they could be controlling and thought I was going to join the family business of running the pharmacy. They were wrong. Don’t get me wrong. I get why it’s important work. It’s just that the idea of spending most of my working hours behind a counter makes me want to take way too many pills. Seeing them again was awkward, to say the least.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Marv,” my dad said flatly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I chose to ignore my mom and him. My plan was to mingle with other family members so I wouldn’t have to deal with them. For a while, this worked. However,

something would bring us together, something I’ll never forget. You see, my uncle’s neighbors were kind of odd.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From what he told me, they were extremely reclusive and ran a butchery in town. Of the few times, he's gone to it, he’s described them as not being all there. It’s not that he thought they were stupid. It’s more that he got the sense they were thinking of things you didn’t want to know about. Getting more words out of them beyond anything to do with pricing was a rarity. In fact, Teddy tried to talk with them, but as soon as he really made eye contact with them, decided against it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They were a couple that was eerily similar in appearance. I suspect the less I know about that, the better and that’s only the second creepiest thing about them. More on that later. Try as I might, eventually I found myself in my parents’ presence. Something to know about them, if they think something should be a certain way, it’s very hard for them to let it be.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Marvin,” my mom said as I was on my second plate, digging into some honey and yams.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Against my better judgment, I acknowledged her and immediately cursed myself for doing so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What is it?”

&#x200B;

“How have you been?”

&#x200B;

“Good.”

&#x200B;

“Is everything okay?”

&#x200B;

“Yep.”

&#x200B;

“Are you sure? No money problems or anything like that?”

&#x200B;

“I’m fine.”

&#x200B;

“Okay, because you know if you do you just have to ask…”

&#x200B;

“I know.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Honestly, I didn’t mean to snap at her. It’s just that I knew what she was trying to do. When I moved out,  I still talked with them a lot. Every time, they would work something money related into the conversation, basically trying to get me to come work for them. I shot it down each time and it got to the point I wouldn’t talk to them for months because I knew that topic would come up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They already have people working for them so I’m guessing their wanting me to is a pride thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I was only asking,” my mom said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced from her to my dad. This was the most interaction I’d gotten from him since I moved out. The week I did, I informed him I wouldn’t be working at the pharmacy. He wasn’t too happy about that. I looked back at my mom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I know. You always do.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I walked away, ignoring her as she called after me. Fast food assistant manager may not be the most glamorous job, but at least it’s a profession that wasn’t forced on me.  I decided to get some fresh air so I went outside. Some cousins of mine were tossing around a glow-in-the-dark football and asked me to join them. I declined and thanked them, saying I was feeling full and that I was going to try and walk it off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They told me they'd see me later and I gave them a half-hearted wave as I started making my way down the road. This is where the first creepiest thing about my uncle's neighbors comes into play. The houses around there are plenty spaced out so there's nothing except long stretches of grass and road for a while. Couple that with a clear star-filled night sky with a big moon and you got some nice walking weather. Also, not having to worry about any cars due to the holiday helped.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The walk wasn’t only to work off some of my fullness or to get away from my parents. I’m someone who can feel overwhelmed by an abundance of social interaction. Therefore, in those kinds of situations, I step away for a bit. During this, I passed by Teddy’s neighbors. Since he’s mentioned their oddities to me on a few occasions, I paid their property no mind and kept going.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That’s what I would be saying if it weren’t for the craziest shit happening.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gobble. Gobble.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stopped. A turkey’s call wasn’t unusual. How primal it sounded was. It was ancient like something that was getting the best sleep of its life for the past several thousand years and was now awake and incredibly pissed off. It was obvious where it was coming from and I began to sweat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I knew that was my cue to head back the way I came. Two things I learned that night. One is that wereturkeys are a thing. Yes, as in the curse of werewolves only it’s turkeys instead. The second was that turkeys can fly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Imagine the pants-shitting fear I was experiencing when I realized the sound was coming from the roof of their barn. I squinted, barely making out a feathery silhouette illuminated by the moonlight. That’s when it spotted me. It leaped off the roof, letting out another loud gobble.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gawked at it, frozen in place as it descended upon me. Its wattle flapped in the wind as it reached out with razor-sharp talons. My brain caught up with my body and told me to move my ass. I jumped out of the way, causing the feathery fiend to narrowly miss grasping its would-be meal. Frantically searching for a way out, I spotted a nearby ditch and dove for it, rolling to the bottom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In addition to keen eyesight, turkeys also have acute hearing. I didn’t even do so much as breathe while waiting for that thing to leave. Everybody has that one person who tends to call at the worst possible times. For me, that person is my mom. I felt the vibration of my phone in my pocket followed by the sinking of my heart.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yanking out my phone, I hit reject call a split second after the ringtone started playing. Breathing low yet rapidly, I could only hope that the wereturkey wouldn’t investigate and move on to another target. In case I got another call, I decided to power it off. That’s when I got a text message.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The ring of it may as well have been a shotgun going off. Every cuss word I could think of flew through my head. I looked up to see open talons falling toward me. I  screamed and rolled out of the way. I tried scrambling out of the ditch only to feel it grab hold of my hoodie by its beak.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Desperate, I lashed out still gripping my phone. My thumb happened to be touching the flashlight app, causing it to activate and illuminate right in the werebird’s face. It let a surprised screech and let me go. I climbed up the rest of the way and ran like my life depended on it, mainly because it did. This wasn’t the first time I’d been in a situation like this. Well, not with ten-foot-tall bird creatures.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, dealing with muggers has given me some instinct to deal with potentially fatal perils. Long story short,  I’ve gotten fast over the years. Unfortunately,  the speed of the fastest humans pales in comparison to a supernatural bird monster. That thing was trying to snap at the back of my knees the entire time. I didn’t think I would be able to make it back to my uncle’s which left me with no choice except to try and lose it on his neighbor’s property.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To my surprise, their front door was open. Even though they were weird, I didn’t think they’d be too happy letting that thing roam their land. I was yelling for help as I was running toward their home and got no answer. I made it inside by the skin of my teeth and slammed the door behind me. This was met by several thunderous slams on the door that caused some cracks to form and an enraged screeching.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wouldn’t be kept out long. I needed a place to hide and call for help. The best room for that would be the basement. The issue was I didn’t have any clue where it was in the house. Luckily, my guessing game was on point and I managed to locate it by the fourth door as the wereturkey finally broke in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Heart racing, I pulled a small table with a vase on it in front of the entrance and then went down, yanking the door closed behind me. It was dark and there was a distinct metallic smell. I felt along the wall, eventually, finding a light switch. Turning it on was a mistake. On the floor, was one of my uncle’s neighbors or rather, what was left of him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shredded flesh in a shape vaguely resembling a man lay in a pool of blood and a headless turkey. I nearly threw up. This was fucked. I turned away from the gruesome sight. My hands were shaking and I forced them to relax as I was dialing the police.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then it dawned on me that they probably wouldn’t believe the truth and that for all intents and purposes, I was in someone’s house unlawfully and on top of that, I was the last person to see a horribly mutilated corpse.  Thinking better of my decision, I instead chose to dial my uncle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Marv? Where are you? The rest of the food will be gone if you don’t…”

&#x200B;

“Teddy, I’m at your neighbors. Get over here now.”

&#x200B;

“What? The hell are you doing there?”

&#x200B;

“I can’t explain right now. All I can say is that I am in deep shit right now and you need to bring your gun.”

&#x200B;

“Is this a joke? If it is it ain't funny.”

&#x200B;

“There’s a body in their basement.”

&#x200B;

“We’ll be over soon. Hang tight.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All I could do then was wait. There was a chair in the basement. I sat in it and exhaled deeply, massaging my temples. Something prompted me to take a closer glance around the room. My eyes fell on a bookcase.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The house was big so I wondered why they’d put it there of all places. Every so often, I would hear the enraged wereturkey smashing something to bits as it was trying to find my hiding spot. A couple times it got way too close for comfort. There was a book already open face down on the floor. I picked it up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One look at the pages and I knew the symbols within were not meant for mortal eyes. One, in particular, contained a humanoid bird creature. Some of the book was in English and that’s how I came across the term “wereturkey”. That made me worry about other monsters similar to it, werewolves for one. What would be the worst?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Probably a weredolphin or a werespider unless this isn’t restricted to solely real animals taking human shape. Otherwise, there might be some shit like werekrakens and that’s not something I want to think about. I figured the book might contain some weakness of the wereturkey in case the blasting it to bits method failed. Too bad that part wasn’t in English.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I guess Teddy’s neighbors were in the process of translating and decided to try some kind of ritual in it that went horribly wrong. It showed an illustration of an occult circle with a turkey being decapitated and its blood pouring into someone’s mouth. As I was processing all this and what I’d seen, there was banging on the basement door.  It had found me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It let out an ear-piercing cry and descended the steps. I  searched for something to defend myself with and grabbed a small knife with the blade half broken. I was so fucked. There wasn’t any escape or way for me to defend myself save a small knife with the blade half bro. Then there was a loud boom and the wereturkey fell down the rest of the way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You alright?” Teddy called out to me from the top of the steps, shotgun in hand.

&#x200B;

“Relatively speaking, I guess.”

&#x200B;

“What is that thing?”

&#x200B;

“Like I said, it’s a long story. Now let’s get…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The creature was getting up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Aw, hell no,” Teddy said and proceeded to shoot it several more times.

&#x200B;

“Hold your fire,” I shouted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He did and I sprinted up the stairs. It was clear guns would only put it down for so long.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don’t know how we can kill it,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My uncle smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, you know what they say, if you can’t beat 'em, burn 'em.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pulled out his lighter and took a flame to the wallpaper. It caught instantly and we booked it. As it turns out, during the wereturkey’s rampage, it busted a pipe, causing a gas leak and by the time it got back upstairs and the fire reached the kitchen, well…Boom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As we got outside, the scent of ash and burnt turkey reached us. This was accompanied by a twisted mix of a turkey and a woman’s agonized screams.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was one hell of a way to spend Thanksgiving. Some other members of my family were in his truck, including my parents. I hopped in the bed and my uncle in the driver’s seat. We sped back to his place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I knew there wasn’t something right about them,” Selma said, shaking her head.

&#x200B;

“That’s an understatement,” I replied. “Now, I think I’ll fix another plate. I made some room while I was in there.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My parents and I eventually got to talking again. I guess when parents have a child that nearly dies that tends to change their perspective. Fortunately, in my case, it made them not want to have my last memories of them be them trying to dictate my actions. Despite the horrors I went through that night, at least some good came out of it. Everyone agreed not to say a word about what occurred.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The official cause was blamed on a gas leak which I suppose is technically true. After all the craziness, it was good to really wind down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“By the way, Marvin, what is that?” my mom asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She pointed and that’s when I  saw that same book on the table. My heart skipped a beat. I didn’t remember grabbing it so how had it gotten there?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That?” I replied. “It’s nothing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m not usually a drinker. However, given what I saw, something to take the edge off seemed warranted. By my fourth beer, I was having a good time again. The rest of the night went great except for when I tried dancing and fell on my face. Yeah, I’m terrible at it. Anyway, that’ll do for this post. I’ve told my roommate, Clyde this story. While I was away, there was a break-in at our [place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/ytznpr/pleasing_no_one/) Man, shit gets crazy during the holidays. On that note, I hope you all [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/comments/p5z5gr/my_list_of_stories/) a [Happy Thanksgiving.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
