The stench hit me before I even stepped inside the old chapel. It was sharp and acrid, like sulfur mixed with rot, clinging to the back of my throat. I gagged but forced myself to push the door open. I wasn’t going to let some creepy old stories keep me from checking the place out.

The air inside was thick, almost heavy, and the beams of my flashlight cut through it like fog. Every step I took seemed to stir up the smell, making it worse. I gagged again, pulling my hoodie up over my nose. The altar caught my attention first—it was too clean, pristine even, like time had ignored it completely.

That’s when I heard it.

A low, rumbling noise echoed through the chapel. My heart froze. It wasn’t a growl or a moan—no, it was weirder than that. It sounded… well, like someone letting one rip. I actually laughed nervously, whispering, “Seriously? Pipes or something, right?”

Then it happened again. Louder. Closer. And with it came a wave of stench so foul it made my eyes water. It wasn’t just rot; it was something worse, something almost alive. My stomach churned, and I stumbled back, pointing the flashlight wildly.

“Hello?” My voice was shaking.

The air seemed to vibrate, and suddenly, I saw it—a shadowy figure near the altar, glowing eyes staring straight at me. It wasn’t human; it wasn’t anything I could name. The rumbling noise came again, longer this time, resonating through the room. The smell hit me like a punch. I gagged so hard I thought I might throw up.

“Leave,” it hissed, its voice echoing unnaturally.

I ran. I didn’t even think about it. I sprinted out of that chapel, choking on the stench and gasping for fresh air. But the smell followed me. No matter what I did—showering, scrubbing my clothes, even burning some of them—it lingered. And at night, in the quiet of my house, I could hear the sound again. Low. Rumbling. Unmistakable.

After three nights of this, I snapped. Armed with a can of air freshener and every ounce of courage I could muster, I marched back to that cursed chapel.

“Show yourself!” I yelled, standing in the middle of the rotting floorboards. “I’m not scared of you!”

The air grew heavy, and the rasping noise started again. The figure materialized near the altar, just like before—tall, shadowy, with those awful glowing eyes. I braced myself, clutching the air freshener like a weapon.

The sound came again, loud and echoing. And then… something shifted. The figure froze, its glowing eyes wide, and muttered, “Oh… uh… excuse me.”

I blinked. “Wait… what?”

The ghost shuffled awkwardly, which was a feat for something that didn’t have feet. “It’s not… uh… something I can control, okay? Being bound here for centuries does things to you.”

I just stared. “You mean to tell me all of this—all the terror, the nightmares, the smell—was just… you farting?”

It crossed its shadowy arms. “*Ethereal emissions*, thank you very much. And do you think I like this? You try haunting a place when your… essence keeps betraying you!”

I didn’t know whether to scream or laugh. Laughter won. I doubled over, gasping for air between fits of giggles. “You’re—oh my god—you’re the gassiest ghost in history!”

The ghost sighed, a sound that was tragically followed by another long, echoing release. “I wanted to seem menacing,” it muttered. “It’s hard to be intimidating when… well, this happens.”

Still laughing, I wiped tears from my eyes. “You could’ve just said something instead of going full Exorcist on me.”

“I thought scaring you would work better,” it said sheepishly.

“Well, it didn’t,” I said, shaking the can of air freshener at it. “Now, do us both a favor and at least try this.”

It took the can, looking vaguely embarrassed. As I left, I could hear the faint psst of the spray followed by a muffled rumble. The ghost’s voice echoed after me, sounding utterly defeated.

“Motherfucker…”
