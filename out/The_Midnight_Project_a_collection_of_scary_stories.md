The Doll

A teenage boy had moved into a new house with his aunt and uncle. He'd lived there for about four months, and during that time he was on his laptop writing stories that he'd hoped to one day publish.

One day, while cleaning the attic, he knocked over a few boxes; one of them had an old porcelain doll inside. The boy picked up the box and dusted it off. Then he opened it and found the doll with a crack in its face from when the boy knocked over the boxes.

He took the doll downstairs and cleaned it. Then he sat it on his dresser, took a picture of it, and put it up on eBay. Two weeks had gone by and no one bought the doll.

The boy eventually took the doll off eBay and went to a pawn shop to see if he could sell it there. But he had no luck. For some reason, no one wanted to buy the doll no matter what.

Eventually, the boy gave up trying to sell the doll and decided to keep it. One night the boy woke up and found that he had been tied down to the bed, and his lips were stapled shut. The boy looked over at his nightstand, and there stood the doll wielding a pair of scissors. "It's playtime," the doll said. Then the doll turned around and looked at you and said, "You're next."

The Crow Man

A farmer was sitting on the bench on his front porch cleaning his rifle and getting ready to shoot whatever it is that comes to his field and eats his crops every night.

Once the farmer was ready, he sat there and waited for the sun to go down. Eventually, the farmer fell asleep.

Suddenly the farmer heard a rustling noise coming from his field. He got up off the bench and ran towards the origin of the sound. At first, he didn't see anything, but then he saw a shadowy figure standing tall amongst the crops.

"Must be the scarecrow," he thought. But when he turned on his flashlight, he saw that it wasn't the scarecrow; it was a half-man half-crow hybrid. A crow man!

The farmer quickly ran for his life, but the crow man was faster. Just before the farmer could get to his house he was pulled back into the cornfield. The farmer looked up and saw the crow man standing over him.

Before the farmer could say anything, the crow man turned the farmer into a giant corn crop. "More food," the crow man said. Then the crow man turned and looked at you and said; "You're dessert."

Feed Me!

A little girl was sitting on the swings singing to herself. Suddenly the girl saw a large woman wearing a dress made of human skin standing in the sandbox.

"Feed me," she groaned. The little girl was very scared. She closed her eyes. "When I open my eyes she'll be gone," the little girl said to herself. Then the girl opened her eyes and saw that the woman was closer, and she had no eyes.

"Feed me," the woman groaned. The little girl closed her eyes again, and then she opened them. The woman was closer and she had sharp teeth like a shark. "Feed me," the woman groaned.

The girl shut her eyes tight. "Go away!" the girl yelled. Then the girl opened her eyes and the woman was standing right in front of her. "Feed me!" the woman shouted. Then the woman grabbed the girl. The little girl screamed, and then the woman swallowed the girl whole.

The woman turned and looked at you and said; "Feed me!!"

The 3-Legged Freak

A young woman was driving around town looking for an art store that sold sculptures. She drove and drove, but she didn't find a single store that had sculptures.

Eventually, she decided to give up and drive home. On her way home she saw an art shop that was selling sculptures. She quickly parked her car and went into the shop. She browsed the sculpture section and eventually found a large sculpture of a cluster of baby doll heads attached to an armless torso with three big long spider legs.

The woman bought the sculpture and took it home. Once she got home she put the sculpture up in her living room. "This goes perfectly with my decor," the woman said.

That night she woke up to strange noises coming from the living room. The woman went downstairs to the living room and saw the sculpture moving. The sculpture was alive!

Before the woman could do anything the sculpture noticed her and stared her straight in the eyes. Suddenly the woman felt an odd feeling. When she looked down she saw that she was turning into a sculpture. Then she looked at you and said; "Run before it gets you too!"

Suddenly she was a large pear-shaped sculpture with two long arms and a triangular-shaped head.
Then the two sculptures stared into your eyes.

The Dirt

A little boy was digging in the dirt outside the house when he suddenly found white dirt. Then he dug more and found green dirt, then red dirt, and then blue dirt, and then orange.

The deeper he dug the more colors he found. The boy kept on digging and collecting a handful of each color of dirt here and there. Eventually, the boy was hundreds of feet deep in the hole he dug. 

Suddenly the boy reached the bottom and found flat polished ceramic. It turns out that the boy and everyone else had been living on a cake. The boy was terrified, he saw the cake-earth lift around him. He watched in horror as a giant ate his home and his family and friends.

The boy ran away in fear. Then he suddenly started to feel sluggish. He looked down and saw that he was melting! He was a mere sprinkle just like everyone else who lived on that cake. As the boy melted into a puddle of sugar and food coloring, two giant ants showed up and began eating the boy alive!

Then you looked down and saw the ants. You are the giant!

My Uncle's Typewriter

There on a desk sat a Smith Corona typewriter with a fresh ink ribbon and a blank sheet of paper. Then along came a teenage girl with a creative mind who was eager to create a story that she could publish.

She sat at the desk and began typing the story that had been on her mind for many days. CLICK CLICK CLICK. DING. Then she finally finished the story and took the manuscript to her uncle.

"Uncle, I've written a story. Would you like to read it?" The girl said. Her uncle read the story and thought it was wonderful. That night the girl put the manuscript in a binder and sat it on her nightstand. She fell asleep instantly and dreamed of publishing her story and becoming a renowned author like her uncle.

Suddenly the girl woke up to a strange noise coming from the manuscript. The manuscript was glowing, and suddenly the monster from her story leaped off the pages and into reality. The monster looked at the girl and the girl looked at the monster. Before the girl could say anything the monster lunged at her. But suddenly, the monster smelled something else; it smelled you! The monster turned around and began running towards you!

Quick, stop reading before it gets you!
