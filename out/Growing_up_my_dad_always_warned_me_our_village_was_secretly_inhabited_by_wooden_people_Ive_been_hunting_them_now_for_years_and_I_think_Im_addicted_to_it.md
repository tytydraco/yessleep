“Alright, let’s get one thing straight: I don’t believe in ghosts, I don’t believe in the Easter bunny, and I sure as *hell* don’t believe in any wooden people.”

At the murky forest’s outer edge, Tom McCann cleared his throat. He waited until me and Dad stopped and faced him head on, then added, “But I’ve got a crew sitting with their thumbs stuck *firmly* up their arses because there’s fairytale monsters running around out here, so I’m stuck playing your stupid game. Congratulations.”

My father said, “Mr. McCann, I know you think I'm crazy, or a conman, or probably both. But I'm telling you this one final time, it’s not too late to take a bath on whatever money you might lose and find another project.”

Our employer was a muscular man with an even tan, dressed in a tracksuit and white trainers. He wore a large Rolex, which caught the moonlight every time he scratched his thick, utility pole neck. “Are you about done?”

“I am.”

“Good. You wanna get paid tonight?”

“It would sure be nice.”

“Then shut the hell up and do what I hired you to do.”

“Fair enough,” my father replied. He grabbed two flashlights from his pack and tossed one in my direction.

I caught it, a lump already rising in my throat. A maze of warped, crooked trees lay before us, their skeletal boughs thrust together like sweeping arms. I’d never even seen a wooden person before—I didn’t yet know whether I’d have the courage to face one down. My greatest fear, back then, was disappointing my old man.

Dad guided us along where spaces occurred naturally until, a dozen or so paces into the forest, the foliage thinned out.

Over his shoulder, he said, “So tell me Mr. McCann, isn’t Redburn a national heritage site? I’m surprised you got permission to bulldoze the place.”

“Is that how you’re gonna fix this problem? Show these tree people I’ve got the right paperwork?”

“I was just curious. You’re not the first visitor who tried buying up land for cheap.”

Our employer rolled his eyes. “Well, Patrick, the simple fact is this new development is gonna be the magnet that attracts opportunity. The suits are scared of eco-warriors who cry on Facebook, sure, but they also know everything I touch turns to gold.”

“Didn’t the wildlife trust try to stop you?”

“’Course they did. Luckily, I don’t believe in no’s.”

“Huh, that’s funny. I could have sworn the judge said ‘no’ to your appeal about the recovery order. You had to hand over, what was it, 19 apartments?”

“Those fraud charges were about as legitimate as your little wooden friends,” Tom hissed, his voice bitter.

Upset this outsider was belittling our beliefs, I clenched my jaw, tight. Dad, however, just chuckled. The sceptic couldn't rile him up—not my father, unshakeable as an oak tree, tall and rangy with a shock of greying hair and a long, straight nose, same as mine. He said, “If you don’t believe this crap, why come begging me for help?”

“Two things. One, I came *asking* for help. And two, I’m no mug. I’ve seen this scam before. You locals make up fairy tales and scream cultural heritage—” air quotes accompanied those words—"to extort the evil entrepreneur from the big city. Well, fair warning, if I don’t see some supernatural shit tonight, you aren’t getting a single cent from me. Sound reasonable?”

“Sure does. Fair warning though, I’d strongly advise not letting any wooden person touch you.”

“Oh gee, I’ll try.” Mr. McCann looked down his nose at me. “Ronan, was it? What age are you Ronan?”

“I’m twelve,” I said.

“Twelve, huh? And is that old enough to come ghost hunting?”

“Ronan can take care of himself,” Dad answered. My face flushed with pleasure at the compliment. “Besides, theres’s things he needs to learn.”

The trail twisted three times, carrying us through marshy grass, alongside a narrow stream, deeper and deeper into the gloom. From out amongst the endless darkness, I could hear the crunch of dead leaves, the snap of rotten wood.

Above the canopy, where we could see it, the moon drifted in and out from behind thick, billowing clouds. And my electrified nerves jumped at every cry of a tiny animal, barely audible beneath the trees whispering in the breeze.

“Well?” Mr. McCann said, after a minute of silence.

“Well what?” Dad asked.

“Isn’t this the part where you tell me about the tree pixies?”

“I thought you didn’t believe in this stuff?”

“I don’t. But I’m not having the crew rock up tomorrow and say you didn’t do the right magic tap dance to cleanse the evil spirits.”

“What do you know about them already?”

“I know they’re keeping me from stream rolling this shithole.”

Dad ducked beneath a bough. “Is that all?”

“They kill children who wander through the forest late at night, blah blah blah. It’s your boilerplate urban—”

Before the baron could finish a mouse scurried out from beneath a downed log. He yelped, hopping from one foot to the other, a little foxtrot, and got to work trying to stomp the little critter, who moved way too fast.

Without looking back, Dad said, “Don’t worry, I’ve seen braver men than you jump out of their skin out here.”

Despite the pent-up anxiety, I chuckled. My father was enjoying this. A lot.

Mr. McCann muttered something too low to hear.

“Well, the kid things partly true,” Dad said on the far side of a nestle of ferns. “What they *actually* do is—” his voice trailed off there. “You know what, it’s too spooky. We don’t want Tom running off without any evidence, do we Ronan?”

“Stop milking it and tell the bloody story.”

Dad’s beam of light swept across the ground in low arcs. “Ronan, you wanna take this one?”

Around us, trees closed in from every angle. As we bullied our way along, our cheeks and arms were gouged by the lacings of sharp branches. It felt like the forest kept reaching out, placing hands on us. Almost against my will, I found myself admiring their resemblance to hideously elongated figures.

Side-by-side with the developer, I cleared my throat. “The wooden people are like us. Or, well…some are. Others not so much. Do you know what a doppelganger is?”

“Nooo,” he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

“A doppelganger is—”

“He’s joking Ronan,” Dad said, as he pushed through more scratching bracken. Beyond it, there lay an ocean of leaves, choked in darkness.

I said, “Oh. So, there’s this colony of wooden people who live out here in wooden towns. In the old days, they stayed away from us, and we stayed away from them. People didn’t worry about them. Like hurricanes. If you lived somewhere that gets a lot of hurricanes, you’d probably think about them, but in Ireland we’ve never had a hurricane because it’s not a warm tropical climate, so we don’t worry about them. It was the same with wooden people. It was hard to stumble across them.

“But then we started building cities and railways and stuff. That meant their homes kept getting destroyed. So, they started moving around. But then we started building *more* stuff so—”

Through a narrow gap, I glimpsed movement and hesitated. A chilly draught sent dead leaves scattering across my boots.

Mr. McCann said, “Let me guess, soon they had so little space they got angry and attacked?”

“Well, no. First they tried to explain their problem.”

“Oh, so our wooden friends speak English? They’re like those talking trees in Game of Thrones are they?” He went and stood beside a nearby birch, pressed his mouth up against a large hollow in its bulbous trunk, and said, “Hey Treebeard, you awake? Mind if I bulldoze this place?” The entrepreneur faced us, grinning, those porcelain teeth prominent against the gloom. “Well waddaya know, he said it’s completely fine.”

In the middle of a patch of dirt and mud and weeds, Dad said, “Quiet, Both of you.”

Branches scraped together roughly as the forest shivered in its various joints.

“What is it, a fox?” Mr. McCann asked.

Dad silenced him with a gesture. From somewhere unseen, whispers rang out. Or maybe it was just the wind. My trembling hand struggled to keep hold of the flashlight. Again and again, I wiped the palm sweat on my jacket and prayed Dad wouldn’t notice.

Dad faced us. “Ronan, you stay here with Mr. McCann. I’m gonna—"

“Oh no,” the cynic fired back. “If I stay put, you’ll go out there, smoke a cigarette, and come out panting like you’ve just performed an exorcism.”

Unable to mask his agitation, Dad exhaled through his nostrils. “You came asking for my help, now I’m giving it to you. Nobody’s trying to rip you off, I promise. You don’t live as part of nature, so you don’t see it, but Ireland is bleeding magic. The world is. And now it’s starting to fight back. If there’s wooden people out here tonight, you’re gonna leave this forest a changed man, believe me. But right now, I need you to listen.”

It was strange to see dad angry; he was usually so even-keeled. To me, he said, “Ronan, I’m going to go ahead and lure them out. Stay here and keep a candle lit in case they come this way.”

From my pack, I grabbed an Olympic-style torch and ignited it with a lighter tucked in the side compartment. The idea of not having Dad around for protection made my neck hairs stir. If the wooden people attacked, it would come down to me to protect us.

My father said, “Remember Mr. McCann, whatever happens, don’t let them touch you.”

This warning was met with an eyeroll.

Flashlight in hand, Dad disappeared behind a cluster of ash trees while I stood there, knees wobbling.

“That’s the trouble with you smalltown folk,” Tom said, once the gloom swallowed Dad whole. “All these superstitions. This development could be a great opportunity, more tax revenue, more jobs. But instead you run around scared of things going bump in the night."

“They’re *not* superstitions,” I snapped, more forcefully than intended. “And besides, even if they were, animals live here too. Are we just gonna wreck *their* homes so you can make some money?”

“Kid, you see this?” He tapped his Rolex. “This baby cost 50k. The Aston Martin I arrived in was triple that. Your Dad drives a 3-door hatchback that’s older than you are, I heard that shit-heap sputtering up the road five minutes before you appeared. Here’s some free advice: if you wanna make something of yourself, pull your head out of the clouds.”

At the corner of my eye, a black blob filled the gaps between trees, briefly. After I cleared my throat I said, “Money isn’t everything.”

“Sorry to burst your bubble, kid, but it is. Why else would your old man be out here? If he was really set on protecting the forest, why take my money to do this phoney cleansing?”

I didn’t have an answer for that, so I turned away instead.

Another gust of cold air made me shiver. A moment later, there came a trample of dead leaves.

I choked out a feeble, “Dad?”

No response.

“Is this the part where you stage an attack?” Mr. McCann asked, acting bored. But did his voice wobble a little?

Branches stirred as the forest took great, shuddery inhales. It sounded like whispers. The rhythm of my heart quickened.

“It’s a nice trick, I’ll give you that.” Tom did a terrible job at sounding disinterested.

More whispers, behind us now. I said a silent prayer Dad arrived back and then whipped my torch and the flashlight around.

Illuminated by the beam, there stood a huge, tumorous oak tree. From behind it, there came a skitter of rapid steps.

I held out the torch like a shield. “Who’s there?”

My companion hung over me like a shadow, so close his short, quick breaths blasted the back of my neck. What happened to all his bravado?

Barely detectable even with the light, the tree inhaled, exhaled. I stood absolutely still, weapon raised and shaking.

“See?” Mr. McCann stuttered. “It’s nothing. Just the win—”

Before he could finish, a pair of eyes opened, cloudy and pale as though stricken by cataracts. Pressed against the tree a face peered back at us, like a mask made from living bark, and smiled.

Together, Mr. McCann and I screamed. My hands fumbled the torch, which slipped into a patch of mud and extinguished with a wet splatter.

The forest erupted into chatter and whispers. Behind us, up ahead, along both sides. I whipped the flashlight in one direction and the next. Anytime the beam landed on a tree there was yet another face, each grinning like a clowder of Cheshire cats.

In unison, figures stepped away from the trunks. From head to toe they were the texture rough bark, except for those pale eyes. Malignant growths engulfed the skulls, twigs and branches sprouted from shoulders and necks, and some were even dappled with furry moss. Limping with crude joints bent at odd angles, they shuffled toward us.

A screaming Mr. McCann tore off through a narrow gap in the undergrowth. I rushed after him, unable to even think straight.

Waist-deep foliage encroached on both sides of the trail, right up to our ankles. I followed the burly man through a maze of sticks and spears as he barrelled ahead, faster than my legs could carry me.

Out of nowhere, he ground to a halt. As I caught up, the terrified man backstepped from *more* wooden people, too many to count. He spun on his heels, knocking me aside as he did, only to discover more closing in from behind, cutting off any hope of escape.

Tom choked out a weak, “Please, leave me alone. I’ll give you anything. Money. Jewellery.” He unclipped is Rolex and offered it as a gift. “I’ll never come back here. Please…just…”

Together, they moved forward, limbs outstretched. They were so close now. So very close.

As Mr. McCann’s foot caught on an exposed root, he collapsed backwards into the soil. All our tormenters came to a halt except for one, which continued on until it was close enough to reach out and touch a limb against Tom’s forehead.

On his hands and knees, he spun away, scrambling toward me across the tangled floor. Already his face had sprouted warts. No, not warts—saplings. Buds. The flesh of his cheeks and forehead bubbled, rapidly swelling in sections, while dark patches grew darker still across his neck, his forearms, his eyes, and even his lips. Paralyzed by fear, I could only watch.

Tears opened up along the sleeves of his tracksuit and ran up the shoulders, across the chest, and down the waist. In a matter of seconds Mr. McCann’s limbs became bloated and elongated. His clothes fell to the floor in tattered ruins.

Naked and deformed, he staggered to his feet and shuffled toward me, his screams now fading, his limbs stiff and awkward. Roots sprouted from his feet and grabbed the soil, biting deep, destroying any hope of forward progress. Through unmovable lips, he sputtered, “Help me…please.” Inside his mouth I saw a thick, green carpet.

Within seconds the man became indistinguishable from a small oak tree, one bough forever reaching forward, the branch lacing inches from my throat.

What broke me out of my trance was the sound of puking. Past the tree that had formerly been Mr. McCann, the wooden person that touched him puked up splinters and moss. It’s bark flaked and shed, exposing beige skin underneath. At the end of one limb, a fist opened and closed, revealing a human hand which then tore wood from a skull in huge chunks. Beneath these sections lay human features—nose, ears, lips. The human flexed and cried and gulped for air, a hatchling emerging from its shell.

I was so entranced by this hideous sight I didn’t notice the other wooden people had closed in. After six petrified backsteps, a low branch thicker than an amputated forearm stabbed the small of my lower back. I spun around, heart clawing against my chest, only to discover I’d reversed into the nearest wooden person.

I dropped onto the ground, head buried in my lap. “Please,” I whimpered. “I don’t want to be one of you. Please.”

Even then my thoughts were of Dad, and what he might have thought seeing his son cower in fear like that.

A hush fell over the forest. I took several short, shuddery inhales. That meant my lungs weren’t solid. Yet.

Slowly, I looked up. Wooden figures loomed over me, motionless. The closest one reeled away its limb.

“Let me through.” My father’s voice issued from within the crowd.

“Dad?” I cried.

Figures stepped apart, clearing a path he stepped through. “Ronan.”

I got up and rushed forward and threw myself into his arms, my cheeks wet with tears. “I dropped the torch, I’m sorry, I’m so—”

“Shush, it’s okay.” He put a warm hand on my shoulder, and my nerves eased.

“But Mr. McCann, he—”

“He’s completely fine.” Dad stepped aside. Past his shoulder, a *new* Mr. McCann pulled on spare clothes Dad brought in his pack.

A dry gulp seized my throat. “We need to run, we need to—”

“It’s okay, we’re not in any danger.” He pulled me in close. “You see son, there’s something you need to know about us. About how I know so much about this place. You and I, Ronan, we were among the first. Years ago, before you were old enough to even remember, our people realized we needed a way to protect ourselves, so I volunteered to go speak with the humans. But they wouldn’t listen. So now we’re pushing back. Against those who want to destroy our home.”

“We’re…we’re wooden people?”

Dad squeezed my hand.

“But what’ll happen to Mr. McCann?”

He gestured toward the tree that was once the real estate mogul. Any hiker who stumbled across it maybe would have made a casual remark about the vaguely human form, the warped portion of bough shaped vaguely like screaming face, forever etched in terror. You could practically hear the silent scream.

Tom McCann—the *new* Tom McCann—grabbed the discarded Rolex from the dirt and brushed it clean. He gave me a little smile and then clasped the watch around his wrist.

I squeezed dad’s hand even harder. “But couldn’t we have helped him? We could have explained—”

He shook his head. “If we transformed one hundred Tom McCanns, a hundred more would just pop up. We need to replace them, son. All of them, the humans. It’s like I said, the world is bleeding magic. And these flesh bags, they never learn. So, we’re taking over. Not just here, but everywhere. England, Germany, Spain, America.”

He kneeled down, brought himself eye level with me. “Are you ready, son? Will you help us protect this world?”

I brushed away my tears, a new hardness in my stomach. [“I will, Dad. I will.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
