I was sitting on the couch, eating dinner while watching television. When all of a sudden I heard the house door open, followed by a booming voice " Hey honey! Hello children! I am back from my trip. Hope you didn't miss me too much!" 

My ears perked up immediately, surprised at his voice coming from the corridor. I quickly left the living room and went to greet him. Specticism prevalent in my eyes, I hadn't expected him to come home from his "trip" so early, I sighed, clearly discontent with something.

You see, I was born in a broken family. Being the 1st child, I had been the only one there to witness the good few years of my parents 17 year marrige. It was an arrangement by both my parent's choice.
But the love had only lasted till we had my sister. It all began to go downhill from there, the house fall always filled with banter and screams of my parents. There was never enough money because my father was fired from his job and couldn't get a new one. My mother had to handle all responsibility of the house.

I came to dislike my father from a really young age, I always knew something was wrong with the man. And he showed his true colors when I turned 10. He started alcohol and regularly beat my mom to get money for booze. He even stole bill money and our savings for it. 

My mom couldn't deal with it anymore, and she sadly passed away due to stress when I was just 12. I couldn't even do anything to help her! Just stood there silently at her funeral.

But then my father had changed, he just went out after my mothers funeral and disappeared for a week! He started a job, looked after me and my sister, and even left booze foe good! But I knew that thing wasn't my father! I knew that man from my birth, and a devil like him couldn't change! I was sure of it.

My suspicions were confirmed one night, when I followed him out for his "buisness trip". What I saw there was horrifying! My father, no..., That THING who wore his skin, sat hunched on the ground near the forest. Fresh blood dripping from his mouth, nearby was a black dog. Whimpering silently as blood dripped from a stump where his hind leg should be! 

I immediately ran back and pretended to never know anything, but he knew that I knew, and so I became his next target, but I am not that easy to hurt. I finally managed to "kill him" again after much struggle. But he came back home The next moon, since then, I have been killing "My father" every full moon for 3 years now. 

It was still not full moon yet, but he had come back somehow, sighing, I digged out a crowbar from my cupboard and went to his room. Seein him sleep soundly, I acted swiftly and made him go to sleep again ' Hopefully his sleep is eternal this time" I sighed to myself as I took his body with me to the forest near our house, burying him with the rest.

 Burying him, where I had buried my real father when I killed him at 12, one the back from my mothers funeral
