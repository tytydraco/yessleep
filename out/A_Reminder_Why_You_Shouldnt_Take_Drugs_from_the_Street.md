You ever have one of those nights where everything feels off? Like the world’s taken a breath, held it, and then let it out slowly, unevenly, just waiting to see what you’ll do? Yeah. Tonight was that night.

I’m a police officer. Been on the force long enough to see things that’d turn a sane person inside out. Shootings, robberies, the usual ugliness that comes with the badge. But nothing prepared me for what I saw that night.

It started around 2:13 a.m.—I’ll never forget the exact time. Call came in from a guy who lives on the east side of town, claiming his neighbor was “losing it.” Typical drug-induced freakout, I figured. I didn’t expect… this.

When I got to the building, the hallway smelled like something dead. Worse than anything I’d smelled on the job before. Not your regular garbage or vomit. This was acidic, almost metallic, like iron burning in your lungs. The door to apartment 3B was cracked. I knocked. “Police,” I said. No answer.

I stepped inside. The lights were out, but the faint glow from the fridge illuminated the chaos. Furniture smashed, walls scratched—no, clawed. And that’s when I saw him.

He wasn’t just high. He was… wrong. His skin had this grayish, mottled sheen, like someone had tried to tan a corpse. His eyes? Bloodshot, wide, and reflecting the dim light like two pieces of broken glass. And he was moving weird—jerky, like every limb was on its own rhythm, and yet… he was fast. Faster than any human should be.

“Hey!” I shouted, gun raised. “Don’t move!”

He didn’t answer. Just lunged.

I fired. Twice. Both shots hit. He didn’t stop. They went straight through his chest. I can’t explain it. He screamed—something inhuman, like a thousand voices scraping together. And then he was on me. I don’t remember much after that.

I woke up in the hospital, bruised, bleeding, barely able to speak. My partner filled me in later. He’d seen it too. Whatever that thing was, it wasn’t just a drug addict gone bad. It was something else. Something… mutated.

They called it “Feral.” A new street drug hitting the city hard. My mind kept going back to that night—back to the creature in 3B. There was something familiar about its rage, its desperation, its… animalistic intelligence. But I couldn’t place it. Not at first.

Over the next few weeks, the city went crazy. Feral users popping up everywhere, attacking anyone, clawing, biting, tearing themselves apart in the streets. The cops were stretched thin. Hospitals filled up. And every time I looked at a news report, I saw that same look in the users’ eyes. That… hunger.

I started digging. Not the legal kind—the obsessive kind. I needed to know what this drug was. Where it came from. Because nothing about it made sense.

That’s when I found the first clue.

An old medical journal from 1989, buried in the archives. Written by some Dr. Halvorsen. The guy had a story—tragic, twisted, insane. He lost his son to rabies in 1988. He had this theory, this… obsession. He believed that an asteroid that had landed in northern Canada that same year carried some kind of biological material that could act as a cure for viral infections—rabies, specifically.

He called it “Project Lyssa.”

According to Halvorsen, the asteroid wasn’t just rock. It carried a pathogen, but it was also… reactive. He thought he could isolate it, neutralize it, turn it into a cure. He experimented for months, obsessed, alone. The journal was filled with notes, chemical formulas, and sketches of his son’s face—screaming, dying, pleading.

And then I found the part that chilled me to my core: he failed. The cure didn’t work. The pathogen mutated. Became… something else. Something he couldn’t contain. And according to his last entry, some of it had already “escaped into the population.”

Feral.

It wasn’t some street lab cooking up meth or crack. It was government-level science gone wrong. And for thirty-something years, it had been out there—hidden, forgotten, waiting for the right person to touch it, inject it, inhale it.

I felt sick. Real sick. All those addicts in the streets—they weren’t just unlucky junkies. They were experiments gone wrong. Walking, screaming, killing experiments.

Then came the nightmares. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that apartment. I saw him—it—staring through the darkness. And then I remembered something else. The way it moved. The way it screamed when I shot it. It wasn’t just the drug making him violent. It was in his bones, his muscles, every fiber of him screaming to survive. To infect.

And that’s when the memory hit me. The bite. During the attack, I’d been clawed. Not deep, just enough to break skin. The doctor had warned about rabies. I laughed it off at the time. But now… my blood runs cold whenever I think about it.

I started seeing patterns in the news—murders, assaults, disappearances—all linked to Feral users. And all with the same twisted, jerky movements, the same reflectionless eyes.

I tried to warn the department, but no one believed me. They called me paranoid. I knew they were right, in a way. Maybe I was losing it. But deep down, I knew the truth: Feral was alive. In a way that science wasn’t supposed to allow.

I started carrying sedatives, anti-rabies meds, anything that might help if I encountered another one. And I did. A week later, cornered another Feral user in a subway tunnel. This one was worse—longer limbs, teeth sharper, nails clawed to points. He—or it—screeched like a wild animal. And for a moment, I froze.

And then I remembered the doctor’s journal.

It wasn’t about bullets. It was about containment. Control. Survival.

I managed to trap it with a makeshift cage, sedating it just enough to survive transport. We locked it in the evidence room. For now. But every night, I hear it. Scratching. Whispering. Something about it reaches into my mind, tells me the same thing over and over:

They made me this way. You can’t stop me. They can’t stop me.

I dug deeper. Halvorsen’s final notes mentioned that some of the pathogen had been distributed as “medicine” for experimental trials. Some of it had ended up in street drugs, disguised as synthetic opioids. Feral wasn’t just an accident. It was a relic of a failed cure, unleashed into the world because no one cared anymore. And the worst part? The government still doesn’t know how to contain it.

I started avoiding people. Avoiding streets at night. Avoiding my own reflection, because I kept thinking… what if that bite wasn’t harmless? What if Feral doesn’t just infect the body, but the mind?

Then came last night. The night that finally proved I was right.

I was checking the containment cell—a routine inspection. Nothing fancy, just making sure it hadn’t broken free. And it was there, pressed against the bars, staring at me. Not screaming, not thrashing, just… waiting. And then it whispered. Not in words. Not out loud. In my head.

It’s in you.

I stumbled back, tripping over my own boots. My heart pounded. And then I saw it—tiny red dots on my skin where the claw had grazed me weeks ago. Nothing serious. Just scratches. But now… I don’t know. My blood feels different. My thoughts… sharper, angrier. Hunger grows in ways I can’t explain.

I’m writing this because someone has to know. Someone has to warn the rest of you. Feral isn’t just a street drug. It isn’t just a freak accident. It’s a legacy of grief, obsession, and failed science. And it’s still out there.

People think they’re just taking a hit. Just trying to escape for a few hours. But they don’t know what they’re touching. What they’re inviting into their body. I don’t know if I’ll survive this, or if I’m already… becoming it. But I do know one thing:

Don’t. Take. Drugs. From. The. Street.

Because sometimes, what looks like escape… is just the beginning of something far worse.

Something that was designed to kill. To mutate. To survive. To spread.

And it’s still out there. Waiting.
