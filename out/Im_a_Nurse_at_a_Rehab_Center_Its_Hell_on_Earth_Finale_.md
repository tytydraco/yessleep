“This presents an issue.” Sinclair sighed as he watched the Todd creature scream and sprint out of the therapy room. I was in complete hysterics as the only friend I had in this hell hole was suddenly transformed into a horrible monster, killed and eaten two orderlies, and is now going on a rampage through the rehab center. 



“Of all the things I expected to happen, this surprisingly wasn’t one of them.” Spencer pulled his face mask down and chuckled softly as he reached into his pocket and pulled out his pack of smokes, slapping the box against his bony hands. I looked around at the three people who had completely ruined my life in such a short time. Sinclair, puffing away on a cigar and seemingly talking with his shadow about the situation, Nurse Taylor fidgeting around and concerned about the monster that had been unleashed into the rehab, and Spencer with not a care in the world, struggling with his bic lighter. 



“How could you…” I whimpered as I looked over at Sinclair. He didn’t even bother acknowledging my presence as he talked to his shadow. His shadow didn’t seem to make any noises but he tilted his head to the side as if he was receiving instructions from Sinclair. “How could you?!” I screamed at Sinclair again, standing up suddenly and going to attack him. Before I even got within a few inches of him, his shadow lunged out and grabbed me by the throat. I coughed and gagged and thrashed against the rotten skeletal creature as it gurgled at me and opened its mouth, ready to eat me. 



“No, don’t eat that one. I’d rather have her suffer for longer than have an easy way out of it.” Sinclair blew a cloud of smoke in my face and sent me into a further coughing fit as the shadow squeezed me tightly by the throat. It gurgled in annoyance and tossed me back on the floor, clearly upset over not being allowed to eat me. 



“You bastard!” I screamed at him again, trying to get back up before I was grabbed from behind by Nurse Taylor and held in a full nelson by her. I thrashed and tried to get her off of me, but she had an iron grip on me and soon she had stopped me from moving altogether. 



“You brought this on yourself you stupid woman,” Sinclair blew another cloud of cigar smoke into my face as he grabbed me by the face, his shadow peeking over his shoulder to watch the event play out. “Your contract was very clear, no relationship is allowed with a patient. This is grounds for termination of both you and your family.” He tapped on his cigar over my head and a large clump of ash fell off of it. “But, until then I will keep you around and punish you for stepping out of line.” He placed the cigar back into his mouth. 



I gritted my teeth, but with the possibility of my family being hurt or killed, kept my mouth shut. Suddenly Nurse Emily came running into the therapy room panting uncontrollably and pointing out into the hall. “T-there’s a monster! Killing patients!” she screamed, panting uncontrollably.



“Bring her along. She’ll want to see what happens to her little friend.” Sinclair sighed, rubbing his tired eyes and walking out into the hall, bumping Emily out of the way. Taylor released me and motioned for me to follow after Sinclair. I wanted so badly to punch every single tooth she had out of her stupid head, but instead, I dug my fingers into my palm and walked after Sinclair. 



The halls were drenched in blood and viscera. Todd had rampaged through the halls and had seemingly ripped anyone who had gotten in his way to complete shreds. Sinclair, despite his posh appearance, walked completely unaffected through the blood and gore. We followed this trail of blood straight to Todd. We found him in the Rec room, attacking a group of husks who offered him no resistance. 



“Better stop him, before he eats all your food.” Sinclair looked at his shadow, which quickly emerged over his shadow, and let out a screech at Todd. Todd quickly snapped his head over towards the scream, a half-eaten torso in his mouth. Todd screamed back at the shadow like a wild animal interrupted from eating its meal. 



“R…E…D…!” Todd gurgled out. Whenever he called out my nickname it was a knife into my soul. I hoped that maybe some part of Todd was in there, but by the way, he now moved and how mangled and horrible his body was, I knew that there was no way that there was anything of Todd left in there. Todd seemed much larger than Sinclair’s shadow and he clearly thought that he had a chance against it, as he dropped the half-eaten person out of his mouth and pounced toward the shadow. 



The two tar covered creatures collided with each other and soon they both morphed into a giant mass of black tar that began to bubble and gurgle as the two fought each other. I thought that because Todd was so much larger than Sinclair’s shadow he might stand some kind of a chance, but as the mass of tar gurgled and bubbled on the floor of the rec room, it was soon plainly obvious that Todd was completely outmatched. 



After a moment of uncertainty, the mass of black goo spit the Todd Creature back out and his limp body slid across the floor of the rec room, his body melting into a blob on the floor and losing all identifiable features that he had possessed. Sinclair’s shadow emerged from the puddle on the floor and gurgled its sick little laugh over Todd’s melting body. 



“Didn’t care for the taste?” Sinclair asked as he flicked his cigar at me. “Well, what are we supposed to do with him?” the businessman asked, crossing his arms and looking around at the carnage that Todd had managed to cause in a few short minutes of a rampage. 



“We could toss him down in the morgue, sir.” Nurse Taylor walked past me and as she did she grabbed me by my bun and dragged me along with her. I grunted and screamed at her, but with Sinclair and his shadow so close to me, I knew it was futile to put up any kind of resistance.



“Hmm, not a half-bad idea.” Sinclair stroked his chin in thought as he looked down at the mass of black goop before him. “Would be a much better method of disposing of bodies as well.” He looked over at his shadow, and it nodded at him in agreement. The shadow took a moment to peer at me with its bright white eyes and let out a gurgled laugh at me. “As for you, Nurse Valois.” Sinclair knowing my last name certainly caught me off guard, I had been certain that he had no idea what my name even started with. 



“I can always use another test subject,” Spencer arrived with a bag of chips in his hands and a cigarette in his mouth. I looked over at him in worry, scared at the prospect of turning into something like Todd. I watched as Spencer opened the bag of chips and began to eat some of them. To my surprise, instead of the food just falling through his jaw, it floated around in his mouth as if I was watching an x-ray of him eating. 



“I’d rather not waste valuable testing materials on a woman.” Sinclair recoiled at the very thought. And while I was thankful, his blatant misogyny quickly covered up any goodwill that had earned the blonde asshole. “Keep this one on ice for me, Nurse Taylor. I’m sure I’ll think of something later.” Sinclair turned back to the mass of goop that Todd had become and had his shadow scoop it up. 



I watched as the group left me alone in the carnage and gore. Nurse Taylor stopped in her tracks and quickly turned back around to me. That stupid smile was back on her face and her smug aura just permeated from her. “Would you kindly, return to work, Nurse Cassandra? While Mr. Sinclair thinks of an appropriate punishment, you still have a job to do.” She waved her fingers at me and practically skipped away back to Sinclair and Spencer. 



It took me the entire day to process what had just happened to Todd. It didn’t truly hit me full force until I returned to his room and found the rose on the floor. I bent over and picked up the flower and thought back to Todd’s sweet face when he gave it to me. That sweet guy who had been a shining light for me in all of this terror. He was gone. Transformed into a horrible creature that probably would have killed me as easily as he did all the patients he had eaten. I started to cry uncontrollably. Hard and to the point that I began to hyperventilate. I was lucky to have closed the door to Todd’s room so no one would walk in on me like this. 



I hid the rose under my shirt and carried it back to my room. Walking past the group of nurses who immediately began whispering and pointing in my direction. But at that time I could give a rat’s ass about what they were saying about me. I returned to my room and closed the door behind me. Lifting my shirt up and pulling the rose out and carried it over to my sink, filling a little cup with water and placing the rose into it. Until my inevitable punishment, I wanted at least a small beacon of hope and love. 



The next few days I was little better than one of the husks. I barely talked or ate and did my duties to the bare minimum. I watched a couple of nurses load a gurney with several body pieces left over from Todd’s rampage and take them toward the direction of the morgue. Sombra has its own morgue where the suicide victims and the victims of overdoses get sent to. I learned from eavesdropping on a few nurses that it had originally served as a crematorium as well to erase every last trace of a patient from the face of the Earth. But now, we don’t need a crematorium anymore. We had a monster to eat all of the bodies that ended up down there.



My life as a husk of a person continued until about four days after Todd’s horrific transformation. I was taking a patient’s blood pressure, my focus barely on the gauge as I listened intently. That was until the alarm suddenly blared over the intercoms. I quickly ripped my stethoscope off to preserve my hearing and quickly snapped my head over toward the intercom. 



“We have a belligerent patient! I repeat, a belligerent patient!” Nurse Taylor’s shrill voice came over the intercom. “All available nurses to the lobby immediately!” I was rather close to the lobby. I could’ve just stayed put and continued doing the bare minimum. After all, what was even the point? But I decided to head to the lobby for reasons I still can’t explain. Maybe I was hoping the patient would kill me, maybe I was hoping I’d see Nurse Taylor get killed, or maybe it was just to see what was happening. For whatever reason I decided to walk to the lobby. 



As I swiped my ID badge and entered the lobby I was greeted by the unmistakable sound of a metal bat hitting something very hard. I watched as one of the nurses keeled over and collapsed to the floor. The culprit was a woman with short brown hair and with obvious track marks on her arms. 



“How the hell did she get a baseball bat?!” One of the nurses asked as she ran away from the woman who was still wearing her regular clothes. I guessed that she had only just arrived at Sombra and she clearly was in no mood to be here at all. I looked over at the front desk and saw Nurse Taylor and Emily cowering behind the desk. 



“[Hannah](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/q053ig/if_youre_an_addict_stay_away_from_sombra_rehab/)! Please calm down!” Nurse Taylor called out, only to be met with a lamp thrown at her full force from the woman, who was apparently named Hannah. 



“You bitches aren’t fucking touching me, ya hear?! Anyone fucking touches me and I’ll break your god damn skull!” Hannah panted, swinging the baseball bat at anyone who made even the slightest move towards her. I just stood there watching this woman, and I was impressed with just how fierce she looked. I’ve seen my fair share of junkies, especially here at Sombra when they first arrive. But immediately I could tell that Hannah was different. She had something that set her apart from everyone else. That was her sheer survival instinct. She did not want to be here and she was gonna go down swinging, literally. 



Hannah’s rampage was cut short after an orderly arrived with a tranquilizer gun. After three darts, Hannah finally collapsed to the floor, her bat rolling away as she fell face-first into the ground. I watched as Taylor peeked over the desk and let out a sigh of relief. Two other nurses and I were given orders to pick Hannah up and place her in a new room. As I carried Hannah to her room, I began to think that maybe, this crazy girl could help me. 



As I returned to the employees-only section I quickly ran to the vending machine. An idea was forming in my head about how I could see Todd and maybe be able to help him. Or at the very least, unleash him on Sombra again. The morgue was kept under lock and key with an ID badge unable to open it, so I needed to know where the key was. And I had a certain little bug that could hopefully tell me. 



I quickly bought a rice crispy treat, hoping that the doodlebug would enjoy it, and quickly made my way to my room. As I did so, I suddenly heard violin music. Sombra is a completely silent and corporate like place. The idea of music suddenly being played from somewhere therefore caught me completely off guard. And the strangest part was that it was coming from the direction of Sinclair’s office. He was the last person on Earth I would expect to be listening to music. 



Entering my room quickly with the sounds of violin music filling the halls of the employees-only section, I closed the door behind me and quickly went to the crack in the wall where the doodlebug had flown away and crawled into. I quickly unwrapped the rice crispy treat and laid it down in front of the crack. 



“I’m sorry for scaring you. I need your help, please. Do you know where Sinclair keeps the key to the morgue?” I asked the crack in the wall, turning my head to the side so that I was only staring at it with my peripheral vision. I waited for a few seconds, starting to get afraid that it had been scared off completely by me staring at it. But soon I watched it walk out and give the crispy treat a sniff, before taking a bite out of it. It looked adorable as laid its sticky notes on the floor and its crayon on top of it. 



As it took a few more nibbles of the crispy treat, it began quickly scribbling on the yellow sticky note. I made sure not to keep direct eye contact with the little bug as it scribbled quickly and continued to nibble on the treat. Soon it finished the doodle, took the rice crispy, and dragged it back into the crack in the wall with it. After I was sure it had returned to the crack of the wall I looked down at what it had drawn. I was immediately gut-punched when I saw what it had drawn. Sinclair’s office door. I had hoped that maybe Taylor would have it, or maybe Emily. But Sinclair had never even crossed my mind. 



I decided then and there that my best bet was to get the new girl Hannah on my side. It was clear to me after my failed scuffles with Sinclair that I was no match at all for him. At the very least having Hannah with me might grant me a modicum of safety and security. The violin music suddenly stopped as I exited my room and closed the door. A few of the other nurses standing out in the hall quickly ran back into their rooms. I was confused as to the reason why, but it was answered when Sinclair’s office door swung open, and the man in question exited. 



“Ah, Nurse Valois,” he said as he stared at me, opening his umbrella and holding it over his head. His shadow peered out from under it and stared at me with its piercing white eyes. “You’ll be happy to know, I’ve thought of a sufficient punishment for you.” He stared at me with those tired eyes and I could feel just how much he hated me. “You’ll learn of it at the end of the day.” He told me as he walked down the hall. His shadow peeked over from the umbrella and smiled at me, which got a severe shiver to crawl up my spine. 



My time was running out, and I needed to act quickly. But this had given me a perfect opportunity since Sinclair was now out of his office. I waited until I heard the metal door that separated the employees-only section from the rest of Sombra slam close behind him as he left. I quickly went over to his office and immediately felt that crushing presence emanating from behind the office door. I held my breath and reached out to open the office door and to my surprise and shock, the door was unlocked. 



Letting out a breath I didn’t know I was holding, I quickly forced myself to enter the office and closed the door behind me. I didn’t know exactly what I expected Sinclair’s office to look like. A part of me was terrified even to contemplate the thought, and the other part thought that it was probably filled with dead bodies or something. But instead, I was met with a cozy and well-decorated office. An ornate clock hung up on the wall and softly ticked away, a large oil painting of Sinclair hung on the wall behind his desk and a large book on his desk.



The book looked incredibly ancient. The pages were so old that it looked like they would immediately crumble into dust if I even breathed on them. Making my way behind Sinclair’s desk I looked down at the old book's pages. Staring before me were pages filled with writing that I’d never seen before and that made no sense to me at all. But the pictures were enough to tell me something. 



They depicted a shadowy creature, that I assumed was Sinclair’s shadow monster. In the picture, a human was reaching out towards the creature with some sort of object, and on the next page it was shown that the shadow and the human were now connected together. I tried to make out what the object that was offered was, but the book was so old and damaged that the object was blurred and smudged away. I peeled my eyes away from the book and looked around Sinclair’s desk, hopeful that the key to the morgue was just sitting there ready for me to take it. 



On the desk, besides the giant old book, were two old black and white photos framed on his desk. One was a picture of a beautiful woman which had a locket draped over it. The other photo was larger and also black and white, depicting a group of soldiers and this one had dog tags draped across it. I picked up the dog tags and looked down at them. Engraved on them were the words ‘Constantine Sinclair. 26th Infantry Division’. 



“He’s a veteran?” I asked with some disbelief. It was impossible to wrap my mind around the posh businessman ever being anywhere near a battlefield. I placed the dog tags back over the picture and started trying to open the drawers on the desk to find the key. Most of the drawers were open but contained only stacks of files and papers. Others had envelopes in them. When I reached the very bottom one however I discovered that it was locked. I pursed my lips, surely this was where the key was hidden. 



Searching for something to pry the drawer open, I noticed a pen knife sitting on the desk, grabbed it, and quickly started trying to jimmy the lock open. After some grunting and elbow grease, I finally managed to pry the desk open. I also bent the knife in the process, but I had at least gotten the drawer open. Sliding the drawer open I was at first disappointed to find that only an old journal was staring back at me. Had the doodlebug lied to me? 



I picked up the leatherbound journal and opened it to the first page. Written in beautiful lettering were the chilling words, ‘I survived the war. But I’m not sure I’m still alive.’ I swallowed some spit building in my mouth and was about to turn to more pages when my eyes went back down to the open drawer. And to my absolute joy, I saw the key clearly labeled ‘Morgue’ staring back at me. Closing the journal I reached down and swiped the key, before placing the journal back and closing the drawer shut. 



As I was about to leave Sinclair’s office, I noticed on the couch across the room from his desk was a violin. That floored me even more than the revelation that Sinclair was possibly a veteran. The fact he played the violin. The thought of him playing it was even less possible of an idea in my mind. Quickly shaking my head I walked over to the door shut off the lights to the office and placed my ear against the thick wooden door. I listened to see if anyone was approaching, and when I was sure I was safe, I silently exited Sinclair’s office and began walking down the staff room halls. 



As I did, another idea formed in my head after thinking about the picture I had seen in Sinclair’s ancient book. Could I offer something to Todd? Something to jog his memory in any way. As I passed my room, I stopped and quickly made one last pit stop. I walked over to the rose that Todd had given me and held its petals gently in my hand. This was the last thing he’d given me before his horrible transformation. It had to jog something in his brain if he even still had one. I carefully took the flower out of its little glass of water and quickly grabbed my clipboard, doing my best to hold it and the flower close to my chest in an attempt to conceal it from the other nurses. 



After saying another thank you to the doodlebug, I exited my room again and made my way down to the exit into the main halls of Sombra. Judging that Hannah was a new patient she’d have been given a vacant room. And even after Todd’s rampage and the numerous suicides most of Sombra’s rooms were filled. So she would’ve been given a room deeper into the complex. I made my way down the halls, now almost completely memorized in my head, and soon I came to the vacant rooms. I stuck my head in a few of them and noticed that one of them had the door closed. 



I walked over to the closed door and plucked the clipboard from the wall to read it. This was Hannah’s room. And written down on her file was that she was in here for a heroin addiction and that she was incredibly uncooperative. I placed her chart back on the wall and took a deep breath. I opened the door to her room and was immediately almost hit by a metal bar. 



“Get the fuck away from me!” Hannah screamed. She’d been changed into her patient uniform and had somehow gotten a hold of a metal bar to replace her bat with. I quickly held my hands up, dropping the clipboard and the rose down to the floor as I tried to keep my distance from her. 



“W-wait! Please I’m here to help you!” I told her, but she was in no mood to believe me, running over and trying to hit me in the head with her metal bar. I quickly jumped out of the way just as she swung and hit the stone wall. 



“Don’t fucking lie to me bitch! Stay away-” She suddenly let out a retch before she doubled over and began throwing up all over the floor. I quickly ran over and pulled the rose away from the puddle of vomit, placing it on her bed before running over to check on her. 



“You’re going through withdrawals,” I told her as I noticed just how badly she was shaking. I looked around her room and noticed that a bottle of pills was sitting on the nightstand near her bed. I also noticed that one of the legs of her bed was missing, and I figured that’s how she got her metal bar. I stood up and fetched the bottle of pills. It was the ones that turned you into a husk, but I also knew that one pill could kill the effects of withdrawals. I quickly went back to Hannah and knelt next to her. 



“Here, take one of these.” I popped open the bottle and got one of them out. Hannah jerked her head away and shoved me to the side. She wasn’t open to trusting me and I didn’t blame her at all. “I’m not like the other nurses here. These pills will turn you into a husk of a patient if you’re forced to take too many. But one will kill the effects of your withdrawal. So you either trust me and stop feeling these effects, or you don’t and suffer.” I offered her a tough choice as I laid the single black pill before her. 



She looked over at it and then up at me before she reached a trembling hand to mine and took the pill. Swallowing it and waiting to see what would happen, it wasn’t long before her trembles stopped and she was able to sit up straight without fear of puking. She looked at me, still not trusting me but much less hostile. 



“What the hell do you want from me?” she asked, spitting on the floor and sitting against the stone wall she’d hit with her metal bar. “What the fuck is going on here?” she asked, reaching out and grabbing the metal bar again. 



“Where do I even start?” I let out an exhausted laugh before I sat on the floor across from her and started from the beginning. By the time I had gotten to Todd’s horrible transformation, Hannah was giving me a look that made me think that she thought I was crazy. But by the time I finished, she was stroking her chin in thought. 



“Say what you told me was true, how am I supposed to help you?” She asked with a raised brow. “Yeah I know how to handle myself, but if your freaky monster boyfriend really does exist, I doubt a metal bed leg will do much.” She wasn’t wrong but she was my only chance at being able to help Todd.



“Well, let’s look at it this way.” I looked up at her with a sad smile. “If all else fails and he kills us? At least we aren’t trapped here any longer.” She stared at me for a second a blinked a few times before letting out an uncontrollable laugh. 



“Shit, you’re right girl.” She stood up slowly, her legs wobbling like a newborn horse. Once she finally got her footing she smacked her metal bar against her hand and smiled at me. “Let’s go get your monster boyfriend, Cassie.” She told me, getting a smile from my face and a tear to fall from my eye. 



Hannah hid her bar in her pants leg and I hid the rose in my waist band under my shirt. We made our way down the halls and I could tell just how confused Hannah was by the twists and turns. By the time we finally arrived at the morgue’s entrance, she was dizzy. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the key to the morgue. As I was about to place it in the lock and open the door, however. 



“What are you doing?” Nurse Emily asked me. I felt my heart fall into the basement and I quickly turned to see the brunette staring at me in confusion. Hannah reached down to her leg about to pull the metal bar out when Emily quickly held her hands up. “Mr. Sinclair isn’t here at Sombra right now, he had an important meeting. And Nurse Taylor is busy in the lobby. You’re safe to go down,” she told me, and that caught me completely off guard. 



“Why are you helping me?” I asked her, surprised that Nurse Taylor’s little lackey was apparently wishing to aid me. She looked around to make sure nobody was near us before she got closer to me and gently whispered. 



“I want to get rid of Taylor,” she told me. My eyes must have been as wide as dinner plates because Emily offered me a smile and a chuckle. “She’s not fit to be head nurse. So…if you get the chance? Kill that cunt for me.” She patted me on the shoulder and went on her way. Hannah watched her leave and then turned to me. 



“I like her,” she said with a smile. I let out a nose laugh before turning back and opening the door of the morgue. We were hit immediately with a foul stench and I gagged out loud while Hannah coughed up a storm. “I’m almost glad I puked my guts out earlier,” she said as she pulled out the metal bar from her pants leg. 



“Must be nice,” I told her, feeling as if everything I’d ever eaten in my entire life was about to come out of my mouth. Taking a deep breath away from the open door, I entered first with Hannah following me close behind. The morgue was well-lit and was only a few feet underground. Once Hannah and I reached the bottom we were greeted by piles of half-eaten bodies and limbs that were strewn everywhere. The morgue cabinets were all flung open and any corpse that may have been in there was long gone. 



“Your boyfriend must be hungry,” Hannah said as she looked around in every direction. I swallowed the bile building up in my throat and joined her in the search for Todd. The morgue wasn’t that big despite how many patients Sombra had, and I could see the other end of it from where we were standing at the exit of the stairs. 



“Todd?” I called out, hopeful that maybe calling out his name would help jog his memory. But nothing came back in return. Hannah took a few steps forward, walking over to the metal morgue cabinets and hitting her bar against it, producing a loud noise. It didn’t seem to do anything at first, that was until I noticed one of the morgue cabinets open up more than it already was, and a long black tar-covered arm reached out from within it. 



“R…E…D” Todd gurgled as he crawled out from within the cabinet. Hannah’s jaw dropped to the floor as Todd completely exited the cabinet and his true size was revealed to the two of us. His piercing white eyes stared into both of our souls and his mouth opened up revealing a white void to the both of us. 



“Oh you got me fucked up,” Hannah looked at me like I had betrayed her in some way. I had tried to warn her, but it was clear that she hadn’t believed me until she actually laid eyes on Todd. Todd let out a loud screech as he began approaching us. With each step he took it seemed like his legs and hands were stuck to the floor, and each step forward ripped them off, only for them to immediately grow back. 



“R…E…D!” He screamed, lunging out towards us with his mouth open, ready to rip us to shreds and eat whatever was left of us. I held up the rose to him like it was going to defend me in some way while Hannah shoved me out of the way and held her metal bed leg like it was a baseball bat. 



“Mo…mo…” she started, I thought she was about to scream monster or mommy or something. What she screamed instead however has left a lasting impression on me and is one of the few things I look back on with a smile. “MONEY SHOT!” she screamed as she smacked Todd in the face with her metal bar. Contrary to when I tried to fight back against Sinclair’s shadow, Todd still seemed to be solid underneath his black goopy form. Todd slammed against the wall and tumbled to the floor in a heap. 



“Holy shit,” I said aloud, staring at Hannah like she was some woman’s MLB all-star. Acting quickly I ran over to Todd and quickly grabbed his face to look at me. He snarled at me like a wild animal before I produced the rose for him to look at. “It’s me, Todd! Cassie!” I shouted at him, waving the rose in his face and begging for him to remember me. “Red!” I shouted at him. 



He stared at me, his body dripping and body cracking with each little move he made. Hannah hovered behind me like a violent guardian angel, making sure that nothing bad happened to me. Todd continued to stare at me for a moment before he reached one of his giant claw like hands to me. I placed the rose in his palm and scooched away from him to let him look at it. 



“R…E…D…?” he asked in a daze. His bright white eyes continued to stare at the red flower, before looking back over at me and Hannah. I couldn’t tell if he remembered me or not but he did start to approach me, his body struggling to keep its shape after Hannah’s money shot to his head. 



“It’s me, Todd. Red,” I told him again, approaching him and reaching my hand out to hold his face. He looked at my hand, before placing his face against it. I smiled softly, hopeful at first. That was until Todd took a hard bite into my hand. I let out a scream, and Hannah let out a curse as she went to hit Todd again. But she suddenly stopped in her tracks and let the bar drop to the floor. 



“Holy shit…Cassie your fucking shadow is disappearing!” She yelled. I screamed and cried so loudly that I didn’t hear her at first. But when her words had been played in my mind I quickly looked over to the wall of mortuary cabinets. And she was right, my shadow was being dissolved before my very eyes. And the bite that Todd gave me, paled in comparison to the searing burning pain that arose from deep within my body. 



It felt like my organs, my spine even my very cells were on fire and burning. I tried to yank my hand away from Todd but his bite was vicelike. Suddenly, Todd released me, and I felt as if my entire body began to convulse and act on its own. I could’ve sworn I heard a million voices yelling at me in my head. Then I heard screaming, horrible agonizing screaming, but I couldn’t see anything. Everything was obscured in darkness and it was as if some unseen creature was dragging me around as people screamed. 



I don’t exactly know what happened afterward. But immediately after blacking out…I woke up in a field. I sat up in shock and quickly looked around in confusion. Staring down at myself I discovered that my scrubs were completely drenched in blood. I patted myself quickly to see if it was my blood, but to my relief and then horror it wasn’t my blood. Where the hell was I? What had happened? 



“R…E…D.” A familiar creature gurgled. I looked around searching for Todd but couldn’t see him. Acting on a whim, I looked down at my shadow, and was horrified to see that my shadow was now…Todd. 



“Todd?!” I screamed out as I stared down at him. He soon emerged completely from the shadow and took shape before me, sitting down on his butt like some giant dog. I stared at him in fear that he was going to hurt me, but instead, he leaned his head down and pressed it against mine. 



“You're safe.”

“I’m so glad.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Couldn’t control self.” 



It was Todd’s voice. Jumbled and barely coherent. But it was his voice. I stared at him and felt tears streaming down my face. Both at being able to hear his voice again, but also in the situation we’d found ourselves in. 



I’ve only been able to piece together bits and pieces of what happened after I blacked out from newspapers, online speculation, and what little Todd can tell me. Todd told me that my offering of a rose to him completed a deal he needed to have a host. He’d eaten my shadow and taken its place. He’s now bound to me, forever. And unfortunately, when we first bonded, I lost control of him almost immediately. I figured because this wasn’t what I wanted at all, that my body just couldn’t handle it. 



We went on another rampage. To this day I don’t know how many we killed, or how badly things became. According to the official press releases, a gas leak at Sombra killed a few patients and the location had to be closed for a few weeks for maintenance. Reading between the lines, that most likely means that me and Todd killed and damaged enough of Sombra to warrant a temporary closure. 



And we had somehow managed to escape during our rampage. Unfortunately, I have no idea if Hannah survived, escaped, or is still being held in Sombra. I hope that one day I can go back for her. The field I had woken up in was ten miles away from Sombra, and since then, me and Todd have been on the run. Hiding from both the law, and Sinclair. I haven’t had contact with my family in months and as much as it pains me, it's for the best. As long as I stay away from them, I hope that Sinclair doesn’t hurt them.



Todd is both the same and different. His monstrous form is hard to get past, but we do have mental conversations with each other. I believe this is also how Sinclair communicates with his shadow. Todd goes through phases of lucidity where he’s his old self. But he can also fall into a feral state after going long enough without eating. 



And that’s the million-dollar question, what have I been feeding Todd? Needless to say, I’m running from the law for that reason as well. I try to limit him to one person a week, but he needs constant food, or else he becomes even less controllable. 



I wanted Todd back more than anything, and because of that, I’ve paid the price. But, despite it all, the running, the killing, all of it. I do love him. Even in this horrible mangled form, when we lay down at night to rest, I love having him with me. 



I don’t know what the future holds for us but at the very least. We’re together.
