Wsg, r/nosleep! My name's Camille. I've been a fan of the subreddit for years and always wondered if I should share my own experiences with you guys. I'm a freelance author, so I knew I wouldn't tell the whole story without perfecting the little details of writing and it would take a while to give satisfying accounts. This is why I'll be publishing this series in chunks. While this happened a while ago(I was 14 or so and I'm now 19 going on 20), the things that happened to me have caused lasting effects on my mental health which is another reason I've kept this story to myself for so long. But I feel it's my duty to share this in case this thing goes after someone else or if anyone has an idea about what it is and how to stop it. Any help understanding what this thing could be is appreciated.

  


I remember so many little details about the day this all started; It was raining, which is rare in California. My Mom had taken my sister to a Volleyball practice, and my Dad had caught a flight to Texas.

  


I was in our den at the back of our house; It's open for the whole family to use and it's got a big window that looks out to our back garden and pool. I was talking to my friends and doodling horror drawings and reading short stories, kinda bored but happy. 

  


At some point I picked up my phone and was scrolling TikTok when I heard a sound and turned around and faced the window. What I saw was partly masked by the darkness but it was too clear to be my imagination.

  


Whatever I was looking at wasn't a person but it wanted to be. It had a smile that was friendly and romantic yet malicious and distorted, Eyes wide yet small, Its Hair long yet short(The hair was phasing into each other while remaining separate), Pressing its face up against the glass with its eyes locked on mine, head cocked to the side, neck skinny but fat, hands misshapen spikes jagging out and digging against the glass. It pressed its entire spider-like body onto the glass in an equally spiderish crawl while sticking to the wall like one; Its body was trying to look fit and attractive at the same time but I could tell. It was neither.

  


I froze. I didn't know what to do and for a while I did nothing. Eventually I did do something. 

  


I backed away, phone in hand, keeping my eyes on it the entire time. Every time I moved back, it scuttled up the glass a bit more in quick bursts toward my direction. When I reached the doorway I could see out the corner of my eye the back door was locked so I made a run for the living room and hid behind the couch. I used my phone to call my mom and whispered to her what happened. She was terrified and came home right away and left my sister with her best friend and her own mother.





 The police were called; They came over and checked out the house but by now it had been an hour and the thing had slipped away. The police couldn't find anything and concluded I must have seen a trick of the light or I was simply faking for clout or something. When they left I slept with my Mom on the couch in the living room because I was too scared to sleep alone.

  


The next day I was writing a story(I think it was for a local youth horror contest)When I noticed a sticky note pasted on a blank space of wall in my bedroom. It was a drawing and the linework on it was shaky and jagged, but I could make out what it was. It was a heart, and in handwriting barely readable, my initials inside it. I began crying as I realized it had found a way in when I noticed water droplets on my desk. I looked up and saw my bedroom window was open.

  


I'm interested if any of you guys have heard or have any idea what this entity is. Let me know and ask me anything you'd like to. I'll be posting the next story shortly!
