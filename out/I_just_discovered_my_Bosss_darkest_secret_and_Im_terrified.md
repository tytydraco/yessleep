It was the early hours of a Sunday morning and while the sunlight outside the window painted the room in a warm glow, it didn’t seem to reach me. It was as if the light didn’t even want to touch me or maybe I just wasn’t willing to let it in. The brightness felt almost mocking, like it was too cheerful for how I was feeling.

I woke up at 8, as usual. The routine felt grounding, though a little dull. I brewed my coffee, the kind I always drank—strong and black, just how I liked it. There was something soothing about it, like it was the one thing I could still control. It didn’t take away the ache in my chest, but for a moment, it helped me forget.

 I looked in the mirror, mumbling the same thing I said each morning. "You can do this. Just get through today." It had become mor than just a habit; it was a lifeline. Without it, I wasn’t even sure if I would make it through the day.



Work had been smooth. Too smooth, actually. My manager—who typically kept us locked in the office until midnight, piling on more and more work like we were some kind of machines—surprised me by telling me to leave early. I must’ve heard wrong. This had to be some kind of mistake. She was the type who expected perfection, and suddenly she's telling me to leave early?

I should’ve felt relieved—who wouldn’t be, after endless hours at the grind? But I couldn’t shake this weird feeling in my gut. My boss never let anyone leave early. Ever. He was the kind of man who thrived on control, keeping us late, pushing us harder, never giving us an inch. And yet, today, he just waved me off, like it was nothing. No explanation, no reason.

 It didn’t feel like kindness. It felt... deliberate. I kept replaying the moment in my head, trying to make sense of it. There was something about the way he spoke—too smooth, like he’d already decided this before I even walked in. 

And his smile? It wasn’t warm. It was thin, calculating, like he knew something I didn’t. Was he being generous for once, or was there something else going on? 

The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt. Maybe he wanted me out of the way. Maybe something was about to happen, and he didn’t want me there to see it. 

It wasn’t just an early dismissal—it felt like I was being removed, and the thought made my chest tighten. Was I imagining things, or was he setting me up for something? Either way, it didn’t feel right. Not at all.

Still, I wasn’t going to argue. I grabbed my bag, still trying to wrap my mind around it and walked out. A strange mix of excitement and confusion buzzed through me. Was this a sign that things were turning around? Or was it just the calm before the storm?

On my way home, I stopped by the supermarket, still trying to make sense of what had just happened. My boss’s face kept creeping into my thoughts.

 He’d always been demanding, sometimes cold, treating us like we were disposable, pushing us harder with each passing day. But today… today he let me go early. Why? Why had he been so… pleasant? Almost too pleasant.

 I couldn’t stop thinking about his comment earlier: "You’ve been working too hard, don’t push yourself today." How did he know I’d been working late? He didn’t even have to say it—I already knew he kept track of everything, from every move I made to every little mistake I made. 

It was like he was watching me, always. And that thought sent a chill down my spine. It felt like he knew more than he should.

At the register, the cashier gave me a long, confused look. It wasn’t the usual friendly smile. This time, his gaze was more like a double-take—like he was trying to figure out if he knew me but just couldn’t place me.

'Back again?' he asked, his voice uncertain. 

I froze for a second. 'No, I just got here,' I said, my voice coming out higher than usual. I forced a laugh, but it felt wrong, like it didn’t belong to me. My hands were shaking now and I had no idea why. Why was he looking at me like that? He glanced at the register screen, then back at me, frowning deeper. 'You already bought these—same items—just a few minutes ago."

The air in my chest tightened, and my stomach dropped. I stared at the screen. There I was. The person in the footage looked just like me—same eyes, same ears, but different clothes. A part of me wanted to laugh. It had to be a mistake. How could it be possible? But the fear was already creeping in. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat louder than the last, and I could feel the cold sweat forming on my back.

I paid quickly, fingers trembling, and tried to focus on getting out of there. The world felt like it was closing in on me. I couldn’t wrap my head around what had just happened. How could someone look exactly like me? Was this some kind of twisted joke? Or was I being targeted, watched… manipulated? My boss's strange behavior today suddenly felt connected, like I was being drawn into something, like I didn’t even have control over my own life anymore.



The walk home felt like a bad dream, like I was moving through fog, trapped in a nightmare I couldn’t shake off. Every step felt heavier, like something was following me, even though I couldn’t see it. My mind wouldn’t stop racing and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t calm down.

That night, I barely slept. My mind replayed the scene over and over, until it felt more like a strange story than something that had actually happened to me. I tried to brush it off, tell myself it was just some bizarre coincidence but the fear wouldn't leave me. It only grew, digging its claws deeper into me.



The next day, my body perfomed all the motions as if on autopilot. Work ended early again, but I barely noticed. I kept telling myself it was nothing, just another strange coincidence. However, that nagging feeling lingered. It clung to me like a shadow that refused to leave. 

When I finally got to my mom’s apartment, I tried to put on a smile. The door opened, and there she was, smiling at me like everything was normal. But then, she said something that sent a cold chill straight to my bones. 

“Did you miss me, or do you just not want to go home?”

It wasn’t just what she said, but the way she said it. The tone was off—too casual, too knowing, like she was in on something I wasn’t. My whole body went stiff. I froze, unable to speak. My heart felt like it had dropped to my stomach, and suddenly, I could feel the color draining from my face. I didn’t know what to do with myself. Everything felt wrong, like I was trapped in a moment I couldn’t escape from.

She noticed right away. “Are you okay?” she asked, her voice soft but filled with concern. “You don’t look so good.”

I opened my mouth to say something, but no words came. I just nodded, trying to force a smile. “I’m fine,” I lied. It felt like my tongue was stuck. The words tasted wrong, like they didn’t belong to me.

She didn’t seem convinced, but she didn’t push. Instead, she laughed softly and shook her head. “Come on in.” I excused myself to the bathroom, needing a moment to breathe. The moment I was alone, I leaned against the sink, staring at my reflection in the mirror. The person staring back at me didn’t seem real. I was there, but I wasn’t. I could barely hold myself together.



When I finally came out, I tried to act normal. But the air felt thick, like I was suffocating. Dinner passed in slow motion. My every movement felt stiff, like I was on autopilot. I couldn’t swallow without feeling like I was choking. The sound of my own heartbeat was deafening in my ears, but I couldn’t bring myself to look up from my plate.

My mom paused, looking at me with that worried frown. “Are you sure you’re okay?” she asked.

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to say that I was just tired or that I was fine, but the words wouldn’t come. I could feel the lie building in my throat. “I’m fine,” I managed, forcing another smile. But it felt like I was lying to both of us. 

The rest of dinner passed in a blur. I didn’t taste the food. I barely heard the conversation. My mind was somewhere else, somewhere dark. I couldn’t stop thinking about the doppelgänger- the person who seemed to know everything about me, who looked like me, who might be living my life.



When I left her apartment, my mind was still spinning. The unease followed me, like a shadow that refused to leave. It was impossible to ignore. I didn’t want to go back to my apartment. I didn’t want to be alone with these thoughts. But I had no choice.

Back home, I Googled it—whatever this was. I couldn’t stop myself. And I found stories from others who'd experienced something similar. The idea that someone could look exactly like you—live your life, take your place—it terrified me.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the person I saw in the footage. Was it all a coincidence? Or was I being targeted? My mind raced with questions I couldn’t answer.


Just the thought that wouldn’t leave me: what if she took over my life?
