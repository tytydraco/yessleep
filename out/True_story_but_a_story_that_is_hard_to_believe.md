So for context this happened in 2022 and I was 16. Me and my mum started to do a lot of spiritual stuff and communicating with spirits and even studied some magic because we had to deal with evil spirits and enitys and demons a few times and this story is one of those times.

So it late at night and dark out it was about 9pm and I had some friends over one of which was interested in this spiritual stuff for the sake of this story her name is Ashley and the other friends are Jack and John (not there real names but safety).
For a few days I've been teaching Ashley how to communicate with a spirit through a pendulum and on this night she was really wanting to communicate with them this way and we all decided to walk down to the park in our town. It was cold and the night had this werid feeling that I can only explain as the feeling of being watched and followed. 

This feeling followed us to the park and once we reached the park we all sat down on the grass and we used our lights on our phones to see what we doing and Ashly started to use the pendulum. (Not sure what you know how this works but you only ask yes and no questions). So i have more experience then my friends in this stuff and my i could in a way sense and feel a spirit and what they are saying. Sorter like a medium if you ever heard of that. And to our right there was a tree and I kept getting a vision well more like a memory of a child hanging themselves on that tree and I told my friends this so Ashley asked the pendulum if the person we was talking was a child and the answer is a (yes) this gave me chills and subconsciously i was focusing more on this spirit child and I could tell he had a connection to this feeling of being watched and followed. Ashley then asked if what I saw is true and the answer was (yes) then I asked Ashley to ask the pendulum if there a negative spirit around so she asked and the answer was (yes).

At this moment I felt my instincts telling me to get everyone out of here and I felt myself going defensive. So i looked around and in the darkness of the night I felt like we was being surrounded and the enargy it was putting of was demonic so I told Ashley to ask if there was demons about and she did and the answer was a (yes). At this time my friend john got a phone call from his dad and he needed to go home and was gonna get picked up. So we all walked over to the road and sat on a bench and we just talked normally but I could feel the danger in the dark and that spirit child staying near by us. So I used what I learned and talked with the spirit child without the pendulum and he told me that the child that killed themselves in the old school i used to go to killed themselves because of the voices of the demons and he did the same. And this made me angry and sad and I wanted to do a spell to banish these demons out of the physical realm. John's dad arrives and we say goodbye to john and once he left Jack started to feeling like something was clawing on his back and Ashley checked and there were scratch marks. And jack started to feel really uncomfortable like something was trying to get into his head.

So I did a protection spell on us but mainly on him to keep him safe. Once that was done I told Ashley what I found out and asked her to ask the pendulum if it's true and the answer was (yes). And this gave us all the creeps. 

(I'm not sure how to explain this next part so bare with me)

So there is a church in town and it was close by our like a 5-10 minute walk and I felt drawn to it so we started to walk towards it. It is about 10pm at this point and it couldn't get any darker and our eyes would have adjusted to the dark but the closer we got to the church the darker our surroundings got and that darkness was closing in us and I pointed it out to Jack and Ashley and they agreed that it was happening and they also felt that feeling of us being surrounded. So yeah we are walking towards the church it's darker then it should be and the darkness is closing in but the closer we got to the church the bells of the church started to go of and we thought WTF it's 10pm but here is where it gets werid if we stopped walking the bells would stop and if we kept walking the bells would get louder. We was getting increasingly creep out and nervous and once we reached the church there was crave and the bells completely stopped and at this time Ashley got her camera out and started to take pictures but she started to feel things like I did where she can sense and feel and see spirits and a spirit that lurked the crave site used to be part of a pedophile group century's ago and it made Ashly furious and she asked me to do a spell or anything to send him somewhere painful so I did..

Moving forward a bit because after that things got a bit foggy for me. I think we spent like 30 minutes in that graveyard until we all agreed to head back to my house. So we left and started to walk to the park behind my house and Ashley kept taking pictures of things and she kept catching creepy shit on camera even a face at one point that wasn't a human face and a claw grabbing a tree (she later sent me these photos so I can have proof) this is when I got fed up and I got jack and Ashly to sit a circle and a draw this ✡️ symbol in the dirt. (No it doesn't represent anything evil it is the symbol of magic) and we all sat around the symbol in the dirt and I said to them we need to hold hands and close there eyes and don't let go and don't open there eyes until I say so. They did just that and I started to do a banishing spell on these demons or enitys or whatever they were that have been hurting children in our town for decades and because they were targeting us now and as I did this they started to get more aggressive we all felt them touching us and jack felt the clawing on his back again but once the spell was said and done they were gone. I told everyone they can let go and open there eyes and Ashly took another picture and she caught on photo this light enity that had wings and everything right next to jack we just assumed it was a angel protecting him. After all this we back to my house and I explained it all to my mum and then they went home.



I know this sounds like a creepypasta and no one will believe it and that's okay you don't have too but I had to get this of my chest. It's been playing on my mind a lot over the last few days
