[\[Part 3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1346qz4/i_trapped_a_monster_in_my_garden_shed_part_3/)

I don’t know when, or if this will upload, as service seems extra finicky now that *they* are being so active.

In the case that, for some reason, it doesn’t appear on this site until much later, I’m writing this on May 1st, the day after the girl who had been Cricket crawled out of her cocoon of black charcoal-like crust and into my life. If signal continues to be so erratic here, I know I won’t be able to keep this up. It’s not just phone service and internet though; my digital alarm clock decided not to work today, and the TV is on the fritz. Thankfully my laptop and phone still function, but that may not be for much longer. I have no idea if the various electronic issues are from the gray helicopters that keep flying around near New Wilderness, or something else.

And if that wasn’t already confusing enough, I watched one of the helicopters get shot down today.

It happened shortly after I woke up, with a dry cough and blurry eyes. Thin tendrils of yellow daylight trickled in through the boards over my bedroom windows, and a few birds chirped outside. My oily rifle lay on the table in front of me, and my hands stank of bore cleaner. A stiffness ran through my limbs from sleeping in such an awkward position, and I stretched to work the sensation from my tired muscles.

*Wait. I fell asleep.*

Adrenaline surged through me, and I staggered to my feet. It took forever to get my discarded shoes on, and my throat burned with a desperate thirst. Not even bothering with my rifle, I flew out my door, and down the hallway to the living room, unsure if the previous night had been one big grief induced nightmare.

In the entranceway to the small living room, I skidded to a halt, the air stuck in my lungs.

Stretched out on the big brown couch, the red and white checkered quilt lay in a crumpled heap, the green can of soda open and empty on the coffee table. Across the room, the pine wood door that separated the parsonage from the sanctuary stood ajar, and a cool breeze blew through the gap.

*It was real. She was real.*

Both terrified and curious, I edged toward the door, and did my best to keep both aged sneakers from squeaking on the hardwood floorboards. Around me, the entire building seemed to hold its breath, my skin crawled, and I thought too late of my Winchester back on my desk.

Taking a deep breath, I shoved through the door, and into the murky depths of the sanctuary.

Without any of the lights on, the exposed square wooden roof beams in the ceiling and old-fashioned oaken pews almost appeared to be made of stone, like the church was far older than the early 1900’s. Warm sheets of light flooded in through the stained-glass windows, bathing the intricate carvings on the backs of the pews in a kaleidoscope of colors. I’d been confused on my first day at this strange church, with the intricate detail of the pews’ woodwork. Most protestant churches tended to be rather bland in decorum, but this church was far from that. The carvings on the pews told the story of creation, starting with nothing but bare wood at the back, and building into the beautiful Garden of Eden at the front row, complete with the figures of a man and woman walking into the rising sun, hand-in-hand. 

Curiously, there were also designs that weren’t old-fashioned in their thinking, enormous dinosaurs etched into the garden alongside man with remarkable detail, wooly mammoths and rhinos walking beside saber-toothed tigers, and majestic flying reptiles that roared with billows of flame into the clear sky. Christianity had long believed that God created the prehistoric titans of ages gone, but the dragon designs were rather odd to me. After all, only in the book of Job was a beast mentioned that could breathe fire, and even then, most older churches had never bothered to dig deeply into that concept. Had the church been newer, I would have assumed some cool creationist artwork had been paid for by the congregation, but this place was ancient, and the pews were too, their wood dried and cracked in places, the polished floorboards creaking, as if it had all been there since Teddy Roosevelt’s presidency.

Across the room, the stranger stood with her back to me, her long honey-colored locks flowing over her shoulders, staring up at one of the stained-glass windows. It depicted the last day in the garden, the terrible day the first man and first woman were banished for their sinful rebellion against God, the man walking away with his arm around his wife’ shoulders, head hung low in shame, while the woman had her hands over her face in sorrow as they left their paradise home forever.

Beneath the aura of the window, the stranger seemed to soak in the waterfall of light, her eyes resting on the sobbing woman with something like pity in her golden irises.

My foot fell on a squeaky floorboard, and heat surged through my face.

She whirled and gasped a deep sigh of relief at spotting me. “Oh, it’s you.”

Coughing against the dryness in my throat, I shuffled my feet, almost too shy to move any closer. “Yeah. I uh, I didn’t know you were in here.”

“Am I not supposed to be?” Her pretty features took on a worried, apologetic wince. “I’m sorry, I just . . . I got restless.”

“Don’t be.” I dug my thumbnail into my palm, trying to quell the nervousness in my chest. I was a grown man, not some bashful teenager, and yet this girl made my mind go blank every time our eyes dared to meet. “It’s God’s house, after all. Everyone is welcome.”

We both fell silent, bathed in the shifting glow of the stained glass and the dim shadows of the old church, unsure how to proceed.

“So—”

“I—”

Our faces matched one another in their shade of embarrassed crimson, and the girl gestured to me. “You first.”

*What was I going to say?*

My mind blanked, and I sighed, feeling quite powerless and stupid. “I . . . you . . . are you hungry? I can make something, if you like.”

Her face lit up with an appreciative grin. “That sounds great.”

*Whop-whop-whop-whop.*

We both tensed, the low thunder roaring closer overhead, and instantly, I recognized the sound.

*Another helicopter.*

I bolted for the door, the girl right on my heels, and together we stumbled out into the crisp morning dew. Everything looked calm and quiet, save for the fact that my mailbox was now missing, all that remained being an empty-post hole and trails of dirt, as if the thing had sprouted legs and walked away.

Despite that, I focused on the sky, too preoccupied with signaling for help, and the girl joined me in waving our arms at the sky.

The slate-gray Apache swooped low over the landscape, like an enormous metal firedrake, a second one flying just to the right of it. They seemed oblivious to us and hugged the treetops in an evasive path toward the ridgeline.

*Shhhhhh.*

Puffy white streaks jetted out from the stubby wings as the aircraft launched a salvo of rockets.

*Boom, boom, boom.*

Somewhere out of sight beyond the ridge, the rockets exploded, and spatters of gunfire picked up, sparks licking the sides of the armored arial beast.

*They’re bombing New Wilderness? Why? Who bombs a wildlife reserve?*

A split second later, another tongue of white snaked through the air, but this time from the ground. One of the helicopters rocked as a different projectile slammed into its tail section and detonated with an orange ball of flame. It spun in a burning circle all the way to the ground, and crashed somewhere in the trees close to the top of the ridgeline with a shriek of rending metal that I could hear from where I stood.

“Are we at war?” Standing beside me on the stone porch steps to the sanctuary, the girl stared with wide, golden irises at the plume of black smoke from the fallen aircraft. “Is this some kind of attack?”

*Let’s hope not. Just one of those rockets could turn this place to matchwood.*

With my brow furrowed, I watched the surviving helicopter speed to safety somewhere out of sight over the horizon. “I don’t know. The only thing over there is some kind of wild animal preserve. Strange.”

We both ducked back inside, and I busied myself with making breakfast in the tiny kitchen of the parsonage. My attempts at eggs and toast proved mildly successful, though the golden-eyed girl didn’t seem to mind how I’d accidentally burnt the wheat slices. She wolfed down four eggs and two pieces of toast, and still welcomed more, her appetite only matched by her parched thirst as she drank close to a half-gallon of water at once.

Across the table, she looked up mid-munch to see me eyeing her, and the girl’s pretty face turned red. “Sorry. It’s really good.”

*Only because you’ve been starving in the forest for who knows how long.*

“You don’t have to apologize.” I blushed and shook my head. “And my cooking skills suck, to be honest. Stacy was always . . .”

The words caught in my throat, like a dry chunk of bread, and I swallowed against a wave of sadness. Yikes, where did that come from? I didn’t need to think about that, not now.

She cocked her head to one side, the girl noticing my discomfort. “Stacy. Is she your wife?”

*Ouch.*

I winced at the jolt of pain in my chest and stared down into the untouched egg yolk on my own plate. “She was.”

Uncomfortable tension cloaked the air, and the girl’s freckled face rippled with a sympathetic grimace. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t know . . .”

“Hey, it’s fine.” Waving her off, I got to my feet, and reached for the coffee pot. “You want some?”

“Yes please.” She stirred her eggs with a fork and threw a glance at the microwave. “So, what does that thing do?”

I paused by the sink, and it took me a moment to realize she was being serious. “Um, it’s a microwave. It cooks food.”

“Microwave?” Both of her bright golden eyes scrunched up in an innocent, confused frown. “So, it cooks with water?”

*What the . . . how do you not know what a microwave is?*

Too stunned to freak out, I looked back at her, and swirled the coffee in my mug. “No, not with water. It uses electricity.”

“Oh.” She bobbed her head, and the girl went back to her eggs, as though nothing abnormal had taken place.

*Okay, I have to know now.*

Pouring a mug of coffee for her, I tried to keep my voice nonchalant. “Hey, just out of curiosity . . . what else around here is unfamiliar to you?”

As it turned out, a lot of things were, as if whoever or whatever had made her forgot to give the strange girl a full set of memories. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to what she knew and didn’t know. She knew what a helicopter was, how personal hygiene worked, and how to read and write. But in other things, she seemed to draw a blank. The microwave wasn’t the only example, my cellphone another mystery to her, especially when I showed her how it could take videos and pictures with the tap of a finger. Everything about Barron County eluded her as well, and she quickly grew comfortable enough to ask me questions, down to the minute details.

“Wow.” The girl watched through the microwave door as a small plate of frozen breakfast sausage links spun round and round, a fascinated smile on her pretty face. “Can it make pies? I can’t remember the last time I had a pie, but I think they’re supposed to be good.”

“I guess it can.” I added some creamer, along with a healthy dose of sugar to her waiting cup of coffee. “But I’d probably still use the regular oven. My mom used to make a mean blackberry cobbler back in Iowa.”

She beamed at that, her teeth a pearly white that took my breath away. “Is that where you’re from?”

Crossing to one of my totes that hadn’t made it to the bedroom, I pried open the plastic lid to sift through some of my belongings. “Yeah. Here, I’ll show you.”

The girl straightened up when I put the photo album on the table, her expression awash in wonder.

I opened the book, and flipped through the pages of my life, glad to have something to distract me from the memory of Stacy’s lifeless corpse in the morgue. “That’s my great-great grandpa Clyde. He ran a pig farm in Indiana before he moved to Iowa. And that’s my grandma Nora Hayes. She emigrated from Ireland, to avoid the fighting during the Troubles. Then there’s my mom and dad in college together.”

“He looks like you.” She pointed to my father’s handsome face and flashed me a warm smile.

“I was named after him.” I shrugged, wishing I could call my father and ask for his advice about my peculiar situation. “Adam James Stirling Junior. Never liked the ‘junior’ part growing up.”

Her happiness dampened somewhat, and the girl’s shoulders slumped. “At least you have a name.”

It hurt, seeing her falter, and I gave the girl a reassuring shoulder-nudge. “You have one, I’m sure of it. You just need to give yourself time to remember.”

“And if I don’t?” She locked eyes with me, a serious, searching gaze on her pixie-like face. “Adam I . . . I woke up in a *hole*, covered in that crusty black stuff. I can’t remember anything about who I am, or where I came from. As far as I know, there’s no photo album out there with my face in it. Does that sound normal to you?”

Her voice bore a tone of pain, a grim knowledge that I couldn’t dispute. Lying to her any further would be more than a sin, but betrayal of the highest degree, and she deserved to know the truth. She was still Cricket after all, even if she no longer had wooden teeth and walked on all fours. I’d cared for her when she wasn’t human. I had to do the same now that she was.

Even if the truth drove her mad.

“Cricket.” I sighed and gripped my coffee mug in anxious hands. “Before you woke up, I called you Cricket.”

She stared at me, aghast, like I’d just told her I could juggle car engines with a blindfold on. “*What?*”

Shutting the photo album, I headed for the back door on the other side of the kitchen. “Come with me.”

It felt strange, walking Cricket back to the little building that had been her home not twenty-four hours ago. The shed stood with its door hanging open, just as I’d left it the day she’d ‘died’. But as I approached, I noticed something peculiar about the dingy brown structure, a strange dark tint to its exterior that looked like soot from far off. Only once I got closer could I see it for what it was.

Handprints.

Dozens upon dozens of black, dried handprints plastered all over the outside of the shed, with smeary dribbles running down from each one. They were all different sizes, male and female, as if every moon-eyed freak for miles had come to place their mark on the building. I’d never seen them do anything so coordinated before, and it unnerved me that there were handprints all along the outside, but absolutely none inside, as if they regarded the dirty hovel as some kind of holy site. From what I could tell, the prints weren’t made in mud, vomit, or feces. No, this was black, deep black, like the ebony blood that oozed from the cuts on their abused limbs.

*What in God’s name is this?*

Soft footfalls swished through the damp grass beside me, and Cricket stopped to stare, her eyes wide, jaw slackened.

Guilt and shame burned in my face, and I scuffed the toe of my shoe at a random weed. “I arrived not long before everything started happening. I was supposed to be the preacher here, but no one ever showed up. My first night, I woke up to look out my window, and there’s all these people running around the yard on all fours, like gorillas. They had white eyes, like fish, and they screamed at the sky.”

Inching closer to the shed, I rand a hand over the rough wood of the sagging door. “I wanted to find a way to help them, to cure them. They look just like us, only . . . dirty, sick, injured. So, I rigged up a trapdoor system and lured one in here.”

Our eyes met, and Cricket’s face paled.

“Me?”

Little hammers of dread pounded against my heart, but I forced myself to nod. “You.”

Her luminescent eyes roamed over the shed, the dirty floor, and the heap of ashes and fire-blackened skulls not far off, taking everything in with horror and shock. “I . . . I don’t understand. Why me?”

A rueful grimace carved itself into my face, the irony of the situation cruel and heavy. “You were the first one I could catch. I wanted to study you, to figure out what you were. I didn’t count on . . .”

“On what?” Cricket’s tone was desperate, as if she wanted to turn tail and run, but couldn’t for the need to know my answer.

*Can I even say it? Is it wrong to say? Adonai, I need your guidance more than ever.*

Both my palms became clammy with sweat, and I stuck them into my pockets. “I didn’t think I’d start to care about you. I assumed you were some monster, or a demon, but . . . you were different. I wanted to protect you.”

She bit her lip and blinked hard, tears pooling in her golden eyes. “So, it’s true then? I . . . I’m not human.”

“You are now.” I insisted, stepping closer, but the girl backed away, and stared down at her hands in revulsion.

“No, I’m not. I was born in a hole, I don’t have a name, or a mother, or a father, because I’m a *monster*.”

The words sent pain slashing through my soul. “No, you’re not. You’re Cricket.”

“I don’t want to be Cricket.” She sobbed, tears flowing over her face in crystalline rivers of anguish. “I want a first name, a middle name, a last name, and a place in a photo album. I want a family, I want friends, I . . . I want to *belong*, Adam.”

Something inside me flared to life, that rare, odd sensation in my core that pushed all other misgivings from my mind, and I moved to wrap my arms around her narrow shoulders. “You belong here.”

“Says who?” She sniffled but wound her fingers up in the fabric of my shirt anyway.

“Says me.” I relished the way her hair smelled sweet in the morning breeze, despite how guilty it made me feel when I thought of Stacy. “We’ll give you a new name. You’ll have a place in our album. You’ll stay here, with me, as long as you want. You’re human, Cricket. You’ll always be human to me.”

A few choked sobs echoed in my ear, but she clung to me like I would blow away in the humid Ohio wind. “You promise?”

That small, familiar flicker of warmth turned into a bonfire in my chest, and I gently brushed my fingertips over her silky blonde hair. “I promise.”

We turned for the parsonage, and she wiped at her face with a sheepish half-smile. A hand slid into mine, and in spite of my conscience howling at me, I didn’t let go. How long had it been since I’d held someone’s hand, been connected in that simple way, grounded, whole? A lifetime, it seemed. A horrid, awful lifetime. Yet, now, in the cheery sun, Cricket’s slender fingers interlacing with mine made the ache in my ragged heart hurt a little less.

Out of caution, I checked over my shoulder, and just managed to catch the blur of something moving in the dark shadows of the distant trees.

It lumbered too fast for me to tell, but I could feel the hazy white eyes of the fiends on my back, their wide, eerie smiles hidden in the bushes, protected by the forest canopy from the bright spring sunlight. More shapes slithered through the woods, eyes, limbs, antlers, wings, claws, shells, and fur. They were watching us, these strange creatures of the night.

Watching . . . and waiting.

*What do they want?*

In the next second, the figure was gone, and I slid through the kitchen door, ensuring to lock it behind me.

The rest of the day went rather smoothly, and I even started to enjoy myself. Cricket wanted to talk about everything, whether she already knew about it or not, and when I showed my personal library to her, she dove into the heaps of novels with childish abandon. She particularly loved the Harry Potter series and made herself a little nook in the corner of the living room, surrounded by books, the red-and-white checkered quilt, and a few snacks I’d brought for her from the kitchen. It amazed me how fast she could read, the pages flying like Cricket wasn’t even looking at them, but when I quizzed her on the storyline and plot, she knew it all by heart. Her retention and comprehension skills were incredible, and she seemed to soak everything in like a sponge. Before long, she moved on to the Chronicles of Narnia, then The Lord of the Rings. By dinnertime, she was halfway through Swiss family Robinson, and wore the biggest smile I’d ever seen.

“Could we build a tree house?” Cricket asked over the macaroni and beef I’d whipped up for a slightly fancier dinner. “They had a really cool one in the book. Maybe we could hide up there at night, and spy on all the shadow-creatures?”

My laugh felt good, like an old shoe that fit just right. “Maybe. We’ll have to see what building materials we can find. I think there’s enough rough sawn timber left over in the wood pile, so we’ll just have to get some nails.”

She speared a few more pieces of macaroni and poked her fork at the notepad by my hand. “What’s that for?”

Pushing it her way, I let Cricket see the list of names I’d copied down throughout the day. “Its for you. You can choose one you like, and then a middle name. Last name we’ll work on together.”

To my surprise, she frowned. “But . . .”

“But what?”

Cricket fidgeted in her chair, the food temporarily forgotten. “The first thing everyone gets when they’re born is their name. I want to be normal, even if that’s asking too much. I don’t want to *pick* a name . . . I want to be given one.”

Her eyes met mine, with a deep, lonely pleading.

*I can’t say no when she looks at me like that.*

“Okay.” I slid the notepad back to myself, ready to do anything to make that frown go away. “Then I’ll pick. We’ll make a day of it, with a cake, candles, everything.”

“Pie.” Her face turned that adorable shade of red that she wore so well, but Cricket’s grateful smile returned. “Blackberry, please. I’ll help make it, I want to know how.”

My heart fluttered at the way she looked at me, her curly honey-colored locks falling around the freckled face, a tenderness in her eyes that made me feel like a kid again. “That sounds—”

*Creak.*

We both froze, our eyes flicking to the nearest boarded-up window. Everything went still, the air thick and heavy all at once, even the shadows seeming to hold their breath. It was dark outside, the hour late, but it looked abyssal beyond the edge of my improvised barricades, as if the world had been swallowed by inky blackness.

Through the slits between the boards, a pair of milky white eyes blinked at us.

Low, hushed sounds filtered in from outside, like the long-gurgled exhale of someone with a respiratory condition. More came, from the opposite window, the locked back door, the shadows of the hallway.

No, not gurgles.

Whispers. Whispers too low, and too jumbled for me to comprehend, but still laced with an icy coldness that send fear dripping down my spine.

*Oh man, this is bad.*

Cricket clapped both hands over her ears, and squeezed her eyes shut. “Why do they keep saying that?”

My blood turned to ice, and I turned to look her in the eye. “Saying what?”

“You can’t hear the words?”

*You can?*

Gulping down a sour taste in my mouth, I shook my head. “I can’t understand any of it.”

A shudder ran through Cricket’s body, and she began to breath harder, as if trying to stave off total panic. “*Lost.* Over and over again. *Lost, lost, lost.*”

I lunged from my chair, and grabbed her by the hand, even as the whispers intensified all around us. The fiends couldn’t get in, I was mostly sure of that, but I couldn’t stand to listen to it much longer.

“This way, come on.”

We ran down the hall, through the parsonage, and into the sanctuary, where broken slices of moonlight bathed the holy room in curtains of eerie blue. I led Cricket to the side, where a few of the doors to the storage closet stood and yanked the worn brass knob.

Slipping in amongst the many racks of Christmas play costumes, copy paper boxes, and folded chairs, we shut ourselves into the windowless room, the relative silence a welcome reprieve. Cricket threw herself into my arms, and we stood there for close to an hour, prisoners in our own home, the musty smell of moth balls and lint all around us.

They’re still out there, scratching, tapping, and whispering through the planks with inhuman glee. I’m typing this with the computer on my lap, sitting on a box of printer paper by the door, my rifle close at hand. Cricket is curled up close by on a stack of old shepherd’s costumes, though I doubt she’s asleep. I’m not sure what the fiends want, if they’re trying to communicate with me, or with Cricket, and whether its for good or ill.

One thing is for certain though.

I don’t have enough ammunition for them all . . . and they’re not going away.
