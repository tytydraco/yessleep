Have you ever wondered why it's a child's instinct to become afraid of the dark? Why adults sometimes wonder what's under their bed? You know what I mean - that creepy, crawling feeling when you get out of the car alone at night, and suddenly it slithers in. A feeling of a bit more weight around the edges of your consciousness. I feel it from the inside; there's a shifting of the way my perception reads the moment. It's all pretending and fear, feeding itself one bite at a time. One moment I am singing happily in your car, the next I am scared shitless of imaginings inside my brain.

The man standing just out of my field of vision is staring and waiting. I see his black suit and feel the history of all the other children he's stared at. There's a memory of his ability to approach my personal space in the blink of an eye, rushing up into my  face with a whoosh of gothic playfulness. It has burn into my memory so deeply that I will never need to experience it again, and always remember the moment enough that it happens on its own inside my scared, mushy brain.

Now you're getting it - the fear experience is rolling in like fog. I  begin to tell myself, you won't run, that it's just an imagining, stamping my foot trying to find reality. Oh, but no, it's winning. It starts at my knees, the weakness rolls up my body until it hits my heart. So strange because it's all in my head. The pressing is like a volume button stuck on high, and I can't change it. Rising and rising, icy and slithering, and completely in control of the station in my head that's irrational and animal. It says, "Run!" It says, "I'll get you!" It says, "I'm scaring you!" I respond with a remote moving of my limbs to get myself to safety. Outside of myself in my response, because no sane person would be controlled by something that wasn't real or tangible.

It's similar to a dog running so fast its ass is tucked under, and all four legs piston together. My reality is closing in upon itself; I can't think anymore, just feeling - just feeling the icy fear that's reached the inside and back of my mind. RUN! Breath comes faster, and my mind is lost in the moment, no longer trying to trick myself into thinking I was ever safe. I run into my home and slam the door. The warmth and safety of the couch and light welcome me. It fades - the fear - as if I just woke from a nightmare to find myself in my comfortable, warm bed. What was I afraid of? It doesn't feel like a real thing so shortly after the assault of adrenaline.

From outside, there is a whisper that only my cells can hear: "I am not in your present, my dear. I am a twisted construct of childhood memories coagulated into a delicious feast for any passing, hungry fiend." "Until next time, sleep well."
