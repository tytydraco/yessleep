It's hard to place exactly when I changed. Exactly when I shifted from a normal person, to whatever I am now. I had a lot of friends, I was funny, I had motivations and dreams. All of that's gone now. People like my family, my friends, they wonder what's wrong with me. I wonder too. 

But I've heard that's how it usually goes, nobody can ever fully rationalize their brains. Why they lash out at people, why they hurt people they love. For me, it very well might have been a slow burn. Hell, maybe I was always this way, cursed from birth. 

I can't say for sure that the experience I'm about to share with you was the tinder that sparked the flame eating away at me. What I can say is that I haven't heard of anyone else who has experienced this, and I feel very alone. I was fourteen, and it was early December in the Midwest. 

If you've experienced winter in the midwest, you've experienced possibly the most miserable weather in the United States. Gray, slush, slippery, inconvenient, uncomfortable, ugly. I hate winter here. 

I got up to go to school like usual, putting on a light jacket and tennis shoes, even though it was freezing out, and a few inches of snow covered the ground. I don't know why I tortured myself like that. It was so cold, and my shoes and socks would get soggy.

“Sam, put a jacket and boots on for Christ's sake.” My mother chastised. I groaned silently. Like most things my mother would scold me for, I knew in the back of my mind that she was right. 

‘Don't play so many video games, study more, play outside, don't drink so much soda, don't hurt yourself’. I'd always ignore her, or fake doing whatever she told me to for a little bit, only to fall back into my old habits.

“I don't wanna lug around a jacket and boots all day mom.” I responded.
“Why don't you just put them in your locker?” She questioned. I knew I didn't have a rational answer. It would be so simple to just be like everyone else and use my damn locker. 

Was it laziness? It had to be. Everything I didn't do was out of laziness.
“I don't use my locker.” I answered. I had already begun to open the door to leave when Mom approached me.

“Wait, Sam.” My mom stopped me. “I've seen your grades recently, they're really bad.” She asserted, a worried expression on her tired face. My heart froze. I hated being confronted by my parents, about anything. 

Whenever they began to scold me for something, my blood would just freeze up, and I'd cast my eyes down.
“It's the beginning of the trimester, winter break's soon anyway. It doesn't matter.” I replied, trying to escape through the front door. 

My mom scoffed and walked closer.
“Hey wait.” She pleaded. “What do you mean it doesn't matter? You can't go your life just coasting by, these things affect your future.” I had heard this speech so many times from my mom and dad that I began to tune it out. 

My eyes unfocused and my brain went fuzzy, I didn't like thinking about the future. I didn't like being confronted about it. I didn't like thinking about the future. That's all that went through my brain whenever I heard this talk.
“Yeah.” I said and nodded.

“Okay well, don't miss the bus.” She imparted, a dejected, unreadable look on her face. I didn't respond, I opened the rest of the door and walked out. And when I made my way to the bus stop, I couldn't help but notice that my mom didn't say ‘I love you’ like she always did. 

Even if she did I wouldn't have said it back, I was a moody brat like that. Maybe she forgot to say it plenty of times, who can blame her. It's just that, when you lose someone important, you replay the last conversation you had with them in your head. Over and over. 

I wonder if my mom knew that she wouldn't be alive to greet me when I came home, that conversation would've been different. I wonder if I knew it was her last day on earth, I would've set my ego aside and hugged her one last time. 

I can't even remember the last time we hugged, I flinched away from her any time she got close. I did it so frequently that she just respected my personal space and stopped trying to hug me. I don't know why I tortured myself like that. 

It was an uneventful day at school. As usual, I was an antisocial creep, a slacker and a dimwit. An annoying attention whore, a greasy haired weirdo, a bitter and jaded acne covered freak. Grotesque, unlovable, vile. 

I returned home like a snail retreating cowardly into its shell. No school work was down that day, like usual. No friends were made, the least I could do was spare other people from having to deal with me. I slumped up to the front door, feeling my cold feet squish in my drenched socks. 

I peered the window before opening the door, and something felt off. Something gnawed at me like termites living in my bones. You know that feeling of impending doom? Some people have it all the time, some people have it for no justifiable reason. 

But sometimes, you feel it, and you know something is wrong. The air feels heavy and foul, like something terrible has been wrought. I swallowed and opened the front door. I didn't say anything as I got home, like usual. 

The house was unnaturally silent, and all the lights were out. I clicked on the light switch, no dice. I raised an eyebrow and walked down the hall, to the living room. None of the light switches I tried were working. 

The power must've been out. I breathed a heavy sigh, wondering if my parents were out by the power box doing something to fix it. I decided I'd just sit in the dark and deal with it until it was fixed. 

I didn't even think to call my parents about it. I slumped on the living room couch and grabbed the tv remote, confused as to why it wasn't turning on. Oh yeah, I thought, the power is out. I literally just confirmed it.

“Fucking idiot…” I whispered under my breath. I laid down and stared at the ceiling. I was always so tired. It felt like at any point of the day I could just slump over and sleep. 

Even though I never did anything physically or mentally demanding, I was always so tired. I napped there in the dark living room for hours. I don't remember exactly what I dreamed about, I only remembered that I woke up anxious, on edge. 

It didn't help that when I woke up from my nap, it was dark outside, and the lights were still out. Leaving me in complete darkness. Alongside the darkness was a chilly breeze, there must not have been any heating in the house. 

I groaned and pulled out my phone. 7:30pm. My eyes widened, it was truly shocking how dark it got earlier in the day this time of year. There were strangely no texts or calls from my parents, and I didn't know where they could possibly be. 

I dialed my mother, who wasn't saved to my contacts, only to hear her ringtone from somewhere else in the house. I turned on my phone's flashlight. The beam of my light caught particles of dust as it cut through the shadows.

“Hello?” I called out. I rubbed my eyes and snapped myself awake. “Mom? Dad?” The house was cold and clinical, silent and empty like a school after hours. I slowly crept toward the hall, searching for the source of the ringtone. 

I couldn't help but feel tension and fear as I crept down the dark halls of my house, my once comforting safe haven transformed into an abyssal catacomb. The ringing got closer as I approached the stairs, it was coming from my parents bedroom on the 2nd floor. 

“Mom?” I called out again. The ringtone sound stopped as my call wasn't answered. I cautiously trudged up the creaking stairs, peering around the corner to view my parents bedroom door. I hesitated to call out again, something choked down my words. 

I saw the silhouette of a figure, standing in my parent's bedroom, door wide open. My heart raced as I shined my light on the figure, it wasn't Mom or dad. It appeared to be a person hunched over, they were tall and thin, and they sat there squatting with their knees bent. 

They were covered in white hair, no, feathers? It was hard to tell in darkness, but from the back it looked like a lanky, white bird person. It had two spiraling horns erecting from its head, and long pointy ears like a horse. 

It slowly turned its head towards me, and I would've screamed if I weren't frozen in terror. It had the snout-like face of a dog, its wide open mouth vacant of teeth. No tongue either, just a white feathered animal face with black lips and eyelids. 

And it's eyes… I still see its eyes when I try to sleep. They were piercing blue, with unnaturally dilated pupils, like two black holes. The beast looked at me excitedly and shifted to face me.

“Sam!” The creature joyously greeted me. Its voice sounded robotic and feminine, like an android mimicking human speech. My hands shook, and my face contorted in utter horror. I bolted down the stairs and nearly skipped every step, I rushed down the hall towards the front door. 

I didn't care to understand what that thing was, I just needed to get out of the house. My spine tingled when I heard the horrifying noise of rapid footsteps approaching me extremely quickly. 

I saw the front door, but before I could even touch the doorknob, I felt the thing grab me with its feathery arms, wrapping them around my abdomen. I screamed.
“NO NO NO! LET ME GO!” I squealed in fear. 

Stinging icy shards stabbed at my veins as I was dragged away by the monster, it lifted me in the air with its powerful hands and carried me down to the dark basement. 

I couldn't see a thing, I only felt the soft feathered hands grabbing me, and overwhelming dread. Before I knew it, I was slumped on the ground. “WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” I yelled. 

I heard the beast giggle in the darkness, an unnerving high pitched laugh. I hyperventilated, my heart beating against my ribs like an animal in a cage. Then, a soft light shone in the basement, revealing the beast sitting across from me. 

The light radiated from two glowing orbs floating gently above the beast's open palms. It stared at me, half enveloped in darkness, devilish blue eyes and toothless smile meeting my gaze. I felt tears streaming down my face. 

“W-what do you want?” I asked, voice quivering.
“You! I want to play a game with you!” It declared. “I am an Angel! Here to take your mommy up to heaven! But before I leave, I want to play one last game with you!” It explained, sickening glee oozing out of its awful voice. 

My face wrinkled in fear and confusion.
“What? An angel? What do you mean you're taking her to heaven?” I questioned. The ‘Angel’ tilted its head creepily, then crawled up to me at frightening speed. I lurched back in surprise.

“Your mommy passed away while you were at school! I'm here to take her to live among the angels! Don't worry, I'll take great care of her.” The Angel jovially informed. My eyes widened.

“W-what? What do you mean she passed away?? What did you do??” I yelled, anger overcoming my fear for a fleeting moment. The Angel leveled its head to mine, smiling creepily mere inches from my face.

“We angels are mere deliverers! We carry the dead up to heaven upon their death, but this is a special occasion young Sam!” The Angels pupils widened as it bore its eyes into my soul. 

“Your father saw the corpse of his wife, and took his own life before his time! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no no no no!” It chanted in a sing-song way. 

“And so, you get to play a game with me! When a soul passes on before it's time, you can challenge their guardian angel to a game! That's me!” It explained.

“What… what for? Why?” I asked.
“It's simple. If you win, your father stays here on earth! And has a chance to die at his proper time! Yay!” The Angel cheered. 

“But! If you lose…” the Angel slowly began to frown, its extremely large pupils constricted, becoming small black dots in a pool of blue. Its voice shifted to a deep, unnerving growl. 

“Your father will not be taken to heaven. He will not join his wife. He wanted to leave the earth before his time, and this shall be the price.” It warned. 

My muscles felt weak. The implications of the supernatural beings' words left me petrified. If I didn't win whatever game it wanted me to play, my father would… I didn't want to think about it.
“What game is it, exactly?” I asked, trying to calm my nerves. 

I needed to focus. The Angel giggled, its pupils dilated and it returned to its jovial self.

“Hide and seek! We both take a light, and take turns being the seeker! The seeker counts to one minute, then starts seeking! They then have ten minutes to find the hider!” The Angel gleefully explained the rules, and pushed one of the glowing orbs towards me with its hand. 

The orb floated in midair, and I grabbed it. It was warm and comforting. The small glowing orb radiated nostalgic feelings of coziness, like drinking hot chocolate or putting on clothing fresh out of the dryer. 

“It will be the first of two wins! You will start as the seeker, then I will seek you! If we both catch each other, we'll have a tie breaker round, where the seeker is randomly decided.” The angel excitedly explained. “Do we have a game?” 

The Angels game sounded wrong. It didn't seem fair, this beast was large and fast, it could probably find me in no time. Then again, I probably wouldn't have a hard time finding it. But something else irked me about the game.

“If I win, will I save my dad's life?” I questioned. The Angel creepily nodded. “So, why not raise the stakes a little bit?” I suggested. The Angel frowned and tilted its head. 

“If I win, I get my dad, and my mom back. If you win…” I took a deep breath. “You can take my father, and take me too.” I asserted. The Angel sat in puzzled silence for a minute. It raised a lanky, feathered hand and stroked its snout. Then, it smiled wide.

“If you win, your mommy, daddy, and you all live on, safe happy lives, beyond your intended death.” The Angel said, before shifting quickly to its narrow pupiled, deep voiced personality. 

“But should you lose, you, your mother, and your father will be lost to the abyss. No heaven. No peace. Complete and utter death.” It finished.

“Deal.” I agreed. The Angel giggled in delight.
“Alright! Time for me to hide! Better start counting! Hahahaha…” The Angel clutched the glowing orb and the light vanished, leaving only the light of my orb. 

It then quickly retreated into the darkness, with rapid silent footsteps. I let out a fearful breath. What have I gotten myself into? As I focused on my own panicked breathing, I counted. 

One… two…three… How did Mom die? Did she really die at all? This couldn't have been an Angel, it's too frightening. Seventeen… eighteen… nineteen… I don't trust that thing, but whatever it is, it's clearly capable of killing me at any time. I might as well do as it says. 

Twenty six… twenty seven… twenty eight… Hopefully I wake up from this nightmare, Mom and dad are safe. I'm just having a bad dream. Forty one… forty two… forty three… I'll save you Mom, Dad. And if I don't, please don't be mad that I tried. Forty nine… fifty.

“Ready or not! Here I come!” I hollered. My voice echoed through the hollow, chilly house. Ten minutes. I had ten minutes to find that massive thing, or else.

I rushed to the stairs, barely minding my steps as I bolted up them. As soon as I exited the basement, I immediately knew something was wrong. This wasn't my house, at least, not anymore.

Usually you'd exit my basement and be met with the foyer, with a view of the dining room and kitchen, then a hall to the left that leads to the laundry room and the stairs to the second floor.

The glowing orb in my hand levitated, its light increasing in radius and revealing most of the “room”. The house now had sprawling, abstract and nonsensical geometry. Stairs spiraled sideways, furniture stuck to the walls and ceiling, and hallways sprawled like a maze.

I felt my stomach sink to my feet as I gazed up at the massive, incomprehensible seussian version of my house. This was going to be impossible, but I had no choice but to try.

I began my search by running up a sloped version of my 2nd floor hallway, which I had to reach by crawling atop my sideways fridge. Another bizarre thing I noticed about this odd scramble of the home was that there were no photos or pictures where they usually should be.

At the end of the hall, through a doorway that usually led to the bathroom, opened up into a long, wooden floor, illuminated by moonlight. It took me a second to realize what room this was, then I gasped.

“H-holy shit.” I whispered in awe. It was my garage, but about twenty times larger, and I was walking along the wooden beams above it. Moonlight poured from the open garage door. 

If I had to guess, the fall from the beam to the hard concrete ground below must have been at least twenty stories. I cautiously walked across the beam, gazing in disbelief at the vast room below.

Then I spotted a feather, dazzling and pearly white. It laid delicately on the wooden beam, then I saw another feather further ahead, and I narrowed my eyes. Was it leaving me a trail of breadcrumbs? Was it a trick?

It was the best lead I had, I'd never find that monster if I wandered aimlessly through this Willy Wonka perversion of my childhood home. The feathers led to a door on the floor.

I awkwardly lifted open the door, and was met with a twisting, spiraling hallway. Furniture and objects I recognized from my house lined the walls all the way down, serving as a chaotic staircase.

Down the stairs was a mirrored version of my bathroom, walking through the empty mirror frame led to another bathroom, then another, and another.

Leaving the bathroom led me to my living room upside down, beyond that was even more flipped and fractaled copies of the rooms and halls of the home.

It would take me all day to describe every odd sight I saw, a version of dining room but ten times smaller I had to crawl through, a climb up a series of beds serving as a ladder, a precarious walk across sideways stair rails bridges above several looped copies of my kitchen.

On and on it went, a seemingly endless labyrinth comprising familiar spaces.
“Where the fuck is it?!” I cursed silently, gritting my teeth. It had to have been eight or so minutes at that point, spotting the occasional feather and following it.

Still no sign of it. Until, at the back of a copy of my basement but stretched like it was taken into Photoshop, I saw a light peeking out from a slightly ajar door. I pushed it open and my eyes widened.

Inside was a room that definitely wasn't in my house, a huge dome shaped room with extravagant chandeliers illuminating countless pictures hanging from strings.

Doing a double take on the pictures, I recognized them. They were all the missing framed photos of me and my family.

A bit of an aside, but I always hated how I looked in pictures. Incredibly unique experience, I know. It's just in every picture that was taken of me at that age, I never smiled. 

Whether it was out of stubbornness or laziness or whatever, I just couldn't bring myself to smile whenever a photo was taken of me. I didn't fully realize that until they were all splayed out before me at that moment. 

Frames contained the happy faces of my mom and dad, grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins and family friends. Holiday gatherings, special events, graduations, in all of them I stood out like a sore thumb, bearing the same gloomy frown.

Though I was on a strict time limit, I couldn't help but stare forlornly at the photos. Is this how I wanted to remember these moments? Is this how I want my family to remember me? Just a miserable, stubborn sad sac?

I don't know why I didn't smile in photos, maybe I saw it as performative, that they were painting over a mundane or miserable moment with a smile. Maybe I just wanted everyone to know how I felt inside. Maybe I was just lazy.

I snapped back to reality, I didn't have much time left to find the Angel. I couldn't justify it, but I knew they had to be in this room, I felt it. At that moment, a particular photo caught my eye. 

It was a picture I don't remember being in, I was dressed in all black, and standing over a grave. The grave read my mother's name, with her birth date, and the date of death being today. I was smiling in the photo.

A look of disgust and fear overtook my face as I scanned the photo, a fake and bastardized simulacrum of me smiled back. I grabbed the photo and looked closer, somehow, I knew.

“Found you.” I asserted. The me in the photo started to move, tilting its head and giggling.
“Hehehe, damn. So close too.” The Angel wearing my skin replied.

I dropped the picture in surprise when he ran at me, moving within the picture. The Angel's white, feathery arms and twisted horns emerged from the picture. He turned his snout towards me and flashed me a toothless grin.

“Now it's MY turn to seek! Are you ready?” He asked. My relief from finding the beast was soon replaced with a feeling of overwhelming dread. “Sixty, fifty nine, fifty eight-” the Angel covered its blue eyes and counted.

I sprinted back to the door, expecting to be greeted by the sprawling nonsensical geometry of the bizarro house. But to my shock, when I exited the room of photos, I was met with the sight of my house returning completely to normal.

The walls shifted and contorted back into their usual size and place, the floor leveled and straightened, the furniture floated back into position.
“No no no no no…” I whispered.

I looked behind me, the door to the photo room had been replaced with the front door. This wasn't fair, I didn't get nearly enough places to hide as the Angel did. I ran up the stairs in a panic, racking my brain for places the Angel wouldn't think to check.

As I ran up the stairs, I grimaced as a horrid stench flooded my nostrils. The smell wasn't here earlier, what was causing this awful odor? It smelled like wet garbage and roadkill, a sickening stench of trash and death.

I covered my mouth and nose.
“God… fuck.” I groaned. I didn't have time to think about it, I had to hide. Without giving it any second thought, I clasped my hands around the glowing orb to snuff out the light, and I rushed to my parents room, hiding in the closet.

The stench suddenly got much more pungent, it crawled through the gaps in my fingers and reached my nose. I gagged and held my breath, maybe the Angel would smell it too and stay away.

“READY OR NOT! HERE I COME!” The Angel squealed in its robotic woman's voice. I tensed and felt cold sweat run down my neck. I could hear its impossibly fast footsteps clambering around the house, bumping into furniture and rushing up and down stairs.

There was no way it wouldn't find me, it was too fast, this wasn't fair. The hardest challenge was trying not to make noise from labored breath, trying to space my breaths as far apart as possible to avoid taking in the rotten stench.

I quaked as I spotted the Angel crawling on the ceiling, entering the bedroom.
“You wouldn't be hiding in here, would you? Sure smells rotten. Hehehe.” The Angel sneered.

My every hair stood in end as he tilted his head from the ceiling, looking directly at the closet I was hiding in.
“I SEE YOU!” It howled. The entire room shook as it dropped from the ceiling. 

I trembled and gasped as it swiftly opened the closet door and grabbed me by the nape.
“You fucker!! You cheated!! I didn't get as many hiding spots!” I whined, thrashing in its grasp.

“Tsk tsk tsk, no language with me young man. I never said we couldn't cheat! Hehehe…” The Angel replied, wagging a finger. My heart dropped, my muscles felt weak and I froze.

At that moment, my worst fears came to light. This was no Angel, that much was obvious. But I realized that I had no reason to trust it would be fair, would even allow the possibility of me winning, or would even grant my wish to bring my parents back if I somehow won.

This was a sadistic, deceptive demon. No more. It set me on the ground and I fell to my knees. I'd never felt more hopeless and afraid in my life.
“Time for the tie breaker round! Let's rock paper scissors for it!” The Angel said excitedly.

My mind raced thinking of what I could do. Could I run out of the house? Call the police? No, it was way too fast, and would catch on immediately. It was dark out, I might be able to run and hide somewhere.

No! That wouldn't work either, the Angel spotted me from the closet even though my orb was out. I can only assume those giant blue eyes can see in the dark better than any human. Then, a lightbulb. If it could cheat, so could I.

“Rock paper scissors, huh?” I got off my knees and stared the beast down. I didn't let its ugly toothless maw and disgusting blue eyes intimidate me. I raised my fist, and the Angel raised its feathered hand likewise.

“Rock, paper, scissors!” We said in unison. I threw paper, and it threw rock. I won.
“Hehehehe, looks like you're seeking!” The Angel squeaked.
“Hold on, I don't think so.” I retorted. The Angel snapped its head an inch from my face with a mix of anger and confusion.

“I won rock paper scissors, that means I get to decide the roles. You're seeking again.” I claimed. The Angel was silent for a moment, then narrowed its eyes. “Doesn't make much sense for me to win rock paper scissors, and be dissatisfied with the result. No?”

“Fine.” The Angel spat, then quickly returned to a state of joy. “Either way, you'll never win.” It raised its hands toward its head and covered its eyes. “Sixty, fifty nine-” As soon as it started counting, I dashed out of the room, down the stairs, and into the kitchen.

“Fortyninefortyeightfortysevenfortysix-” The angel began counting down faster. I whipped my head around in surprise. Doesn't matter, I still had all the time I needed. I ran over to the cutlery, and thank god, the knives were there.

I grabbed two of the longest, sharpest kitchen knives we had. Then I opened the pantry and hid inside. If this thing can see in the dark, then I'll just have to make sure it can't see at all.

“Fivefourthreetwoone! READY OR NOT! HERE I COME! AHAHAHA” The Angel finished its ‘minute’ long countdown and let out a sickening laugh. I heard its incredibly fast and powerful footsteps pummeling the floor as it crawled down the stairs, scouring the dining room.

I needed to be ready, this thing was incomprehensibly fast, I needed to pop out the moment I thought it'd open the pantry. I felt the room shake as it entered the kitchen, crawling on the wall.

“Hungry Sam?” It called out. I saw it through the gap in the door, it had its back facing me, checking under the kitchen table. I hid out of sight, trying my best to silence my breathing. 

My heart was pounding in my ears. I thought of my mom, my dad, my life. My death. I always tried to push out the thought of death, it terrified me. In fact, life terrified me too. That's how I existed up until that point.

Too scared to face life, too scared to think about death, just a miserable creature caught between paralyzing fear from both ends. But in the moment, I think I came to a realization. Death isn't a fear you have to face.

Despite what many people tell you all your life, there is no need for some big epiphany where death suddenly becomes not scary, not tragic. You can go your whole life and be terrified of it, I know I still am. 

And that's because overcoming that fear isn't necessary for it. Death isn't gonna be any more or else kind just because you accept it, aren't afraid of it, are prepared for its arrival. It takes us all the same, it comes no matter what.

But if you're afraid of life? Well, you're not gonna live if you're terrified of it. And that's it really, you don't need to get over your fear of death to live just your fear of living. As my pulse pounded in my ears standing in that pantry, I shut my eyes tight.

When I see my mom again, I'll hug her, I thought. I'll smile in all my photos, I'll wear boots in the winter, I'll do all the things normal people do.
“This door wasn't open before? Was it Sam?” The Angel teased, I heard it place a hand on the pantry door.

I'm not afraid anymore.

I slammed into the door and it swung open. The Angel was bashed in the face by the door, and caught by surprise. I immediately fixed my eyes on the Angels head, which turned to face me. I raised both hands behind my head, gripping both knives tight.

I guess the Angel didn't see the knives, or expected me to run, so it didn't react to my charge. I used all the might my fourteen year old body with no exercise could muster, and plunged the knives down in an arc motion.

The knife in my right hand stabbed gruesomely into the Angel's eye, spurting out a mixture of blood and strange, glowing golden pus. Simultaneously, the knife in my left hand narrowly missed the other eye, instead stabbing into its brow.

The Angel let out an agonized scream and threw its head back in pain. The scream was haunting, and unimaginably loud. It sounded like a chorus of babies all being burned alive. I covered my ears from the deafening shriek.

What do I do now? I panicked. I didn't think this through.
“YOU FUCKER!! BURN IN HELL!!” The Angel cried. It slammed its hands down on the linoleum floor, and the surroundings began to change.

The walls stretched and rearranged, morphing into the trippy abstract nightmare fun house from earlier. Except this time, yellow glowing orbs like the ones we were using appeared all over, lighting up the entire labyrinth.

I thought quickly, it was half blind now, sonI quickly dove to its blind side. The Angel took notice and turned swiftly, swiping at me with its long arm. It missed me by a hair, and I dashed to the other side of the kitchen.

I spotted the cutlery drawer placed upside down atop an elongated version of my fridge, I realized at that moment that it probably would've been smart to grab more knives. I quickly climbed up my slanted kitchen table and jumped atop the counter, which was slightly sloped.

“WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GO? YOU LITTLE SHIT!” The Angel screeched. My heart fluttered with newfound determination when I realized something. 

I missed his right eye, but enough blood was pouring down from the wound above it to prevent him from seeing out of it clearly. He may as well have been blind. The Angel furiously swiped at the malformed, misplaced furniture, blindly scouring the kitchen for me.

I focused my attention back to the cutlery drawer, and climbed atop the elongated fridge. Once I reached the top, I tensed as I accidentally knocked over a glass that had been placed there.

The glass shattered on the ground, and the Angel perked its head up, going silent for a moment. “Don't think those were my only eyes!” It yelled, curving its black lips in a smile.

It hunched over, and its back suddenly began to bubble, like the skin was boiling. Then something erupted from its back, spraying blood and golden pus everywhere. 

From its back now sprouted six feathery tentacle-like wings, long and flowing, white feathers coated in blood. Small slits on the feathered tendrils opened, revealing many small blue eyes.

I gazed down at the beast in horror, my only chance was robbed from me. I turned my attention back to the cutlery drawer, and reached up to open it. Being upside down, many spoons, forks and knives fell as soon as I opened it, and I ducked.

“I see you!” The Angel spat as eating utensils clanged on the floor. It jumped to the ceiling, and crawled straight for me, grabbing my neck and dragging me down to the floor in an instant.

I yelped in pain, the vex grip of the Angel mixed with my back being slammed to the hard linoleum ground knocked the wind out of me. Tears formed in my eyes and I groaned, hardly breathing.

“So you couldn't win hide and seek and now you're a sore loser huh? You wanna resort to violence!? I'll show you violence!!” The Angel screamed in my face.

Its head trembled, and its toothless mouth suddenly seeped saliva mixed with golden pus and dark red blood. One after the other, razor sharp teeth began filling its mouths, erupting from its gums with a spurt of blood.

It grabbed my arm, and chomped down. It was the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, I may have passed out just from screaming alone. But I fought to stay awake. I kicked and screamed as the Angel pinned me down.

It slowly removed its teeth from the fresh, deep scores in my arm, sticky webs of blood trailing behind. I breathed through my tears and tried to think of something to do. I spotted the broken glass on the floor, I could reach a shard despite the Angel pinning me down.

I grabbed a shard and gripped it tight, not caring that it was digging into my hand, and plunged it into the Angel's neck. A river of blood and golden liquid spewed from its neck, it gurgled and clutched the fresh wound, allowing me a chance to escape.

I scrambled to my feet and rushed out of the kitchen. Beyond the kitchen was a lopsided, diagonal dining room. I didn't think and slid down the floor, hearing the Angel clambering after me.

The Angel only made high pitch squeals and gurgling noises, its tendril wings quivering as it awkwardly shambled down after me. I could tell the Angel was significantly slower than it was before, but still fast.

I ran down the diagonal dining room, dashed through a looping hallway, ran past a room full of upside down beds. I didn't know where I was running, I just knew I had to get away from the Angel, all while gritting my teeth through the white hot pain on my arm.

I eventually arrived at a massive version of my living room, furniture floating in midair, stairs where there shouldn't be going in all directions. There, at the end of the massive living room, was a doorway, one I had yet to see in the twisted version of my house.

The front door. I could see the cold night outside. I summoned all the energy I could, and ran to the door. My spine tingled as I heard the stomping of the Angel, clambering closer and closer. 

I put one final push into my legs, and… I tripped. On nothing. I must have just placed my foot wrong, but in any case, I fell over. I tried crawling to my feet, but it was too late.

The Angel put its hands on my back, and I was pinned again. I turned to face the furious beast, and stared up at its many eyes in terror.
“Shhaammm…” It said through thick blood coating its mouth.

“You…” It weakly spat out. It couldn't finish its sentence. More strangely, I could feel its hold on me weakening. The eyed wings slowly lowered, and the beast slumped on its side. It breathed heavily, gurgling with each breath.

It was dying. I slowly rose to my feet. I felt no pity for the creature as it laid there bleeding, and I turned to walk to the front door. I placed my hand on the knob, and turned to take one final look.

The glowing orbs began to dim, fading into darkness. The geometry of the house slowly returned to normal, furniture rearranging to its proper place and rooms stretching back to their proper size.

The Angel was on its hands and knees, trembling, blood and golden fluid pooling on the carpet below. I turned my back, and opened the door.

I walked out into the cold night, feeling the air sting my arm. Looking back, the house was completely normal. The lights were all still off, so the doorway led to an endless void.

I ran to the neighbors house and banged on the door. They seemed very upset to be woken at that hour, but their annoyance turned to concern when they saw my wounds, and I asked them to call the police.

After searching the house, the police talked amongst themselves, and I wasn't a part of the conversation. It's not like I wanted to stay out there and freeze anyway. A medic observed my wounds, perplexed. 

They wrapped up my arm, and told me it needed more serious treatment, so I was taken to the hospital. As I lay in the hospital bed, I looked at my phone, saving my mother's and father's numbers to my contacts, and putting a heart emoji next to their names.

I tried my best to sleep, but the pain from the wound and the deeply upsetting experience with the Angel kept me awake for hours. It was around 4am when I finally couldn't keep my eyes open, and fell asleep.

The next day, an officer entered the room I was staying in.
It was then that I was told the truth, the news I had feared most when I tried to sleep, the gnawing feeling of doom that haunted me ever since I escaped the Angel.

“I'm so sorry Sam… but your mother has lost her life. Your father is alive, just in hospice.” The officer informed me with a grim expression. My heart shattered. It was hopeless from the start, I couldn't have beat the Angel fairly, and harming it didn't grant my wish.

At the very least, I was thankful my father was still alive. But knowing that no matter how hard I had fought, no matter how much terror I endured to try and save her, my mother was gone.

My face wrinkled as I gasped out ugly sobs, I didn't think it was possible for me to cry that hard. I promised myself I would change, that I would tell her that I love her.

I don't know why I changed too late. I don't know why I tortured myself like that. But there was one more detail, one more thing I wanted to know, one more question I had. One I deeply wished I never asked.

“H-how, how did she die?” I questioned through a sniffle. The officer looked at his feet and sighed, then looked at my eyes with sympathy in his voice.

“She had a heart attack. They found her in her bedroom closet. Your father was found unconscious next to her, tried to take his own life by overdosing.”
