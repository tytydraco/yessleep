I don't usually come back to these posts. I posted the first one mostly to get it out of my head, and the responses stuck with me. A few people suggested practical things, and I figured why not try? Worst case, I waste a weekend and feel stupid. Best case, maybe it actually does something.

First, the crawlspace. One commenter asked if I had thought about sealing it off or adding a locked door. That made sense. The access panel is just a square of plywood screwed into the joists under the house. Nothing fancy. I bought some heavy-duty screws, a padlock hasp, and a sheet of thicker plywood from the hardware store. While I was down there, I avoided looking directly at the nest spot. The dirt was drier now, but the outline was still there, like a fossil. The sweet-metal smell was faint but present, clinging to everything.

I screwed the new panel over the old one, added the hasp, and locked it with the biggest padlock they had. Then I caulked around the edges for good measure. It felt solid. Like I had finally put a real barrier between me and whatever has been using that space.

Next, the cleansing stuff. Multiple people mentioned salt and sage. I don't know much about that world. I'm not into crystals or whatever. But I figured it couldn't hurt. I got rock salt from the grocery store (the kind for driveways, big chunks) and a bundle of sage from a local shop that smelled like a hippie gift store. I went room by room, starting downstairs.

I sprinkled salt along every windowsill and doorway threshold, inside and out. Thick lines, no gaps. Then I lit the sage bundle and walked the house clockwise, letting the smoke curl into corners, under furniture, up the stairs. The smell was strong, herbal, almost medicinal. It cut through the metallic tang for the first time in weeks. I even opened the guest bedroom door and wafted smoke toward the closet where the scratches used to be. Nothing moved. No sudden cold spots or whispers. Just quiet.

I finished around dusk, put the sage out in the sink, and sat on the couch with every light on. For a couple hours, the house felt lighter. The listening feeling was dialed way back. I even turned the TV off for a bit and just sat in the silence. It was the first time in months I didn't feel watched.

Then around 2 a.m., I woke up.

The listening was back, but different. Sharper. Closer. It wasn't just in the room. It was under the floor. Right beneath where I was lying. Slow, deliberate scrapes, like something testing the new plywood from the other side. Not frantic. Patient. Like it knew the barrier was there and was figuring it out.

I didn't move. I listened as it circled the perimeter of the panel. Scrape, pause, scrape again. Then it stopped. For a long time. I thought maybe it gave up.

Until I heard the soft click of the padlock hasp shifting. Not breaking. Just moving, like something was pressing against it, learning the shape.

I stayed frozen until morning. When I finally checked, the lock was still closed, the hasp untouched. No marks. But the plywood had fresh, shallow gouges on the underside. I could see them when I shined the flashlight through the crack. Four parallel lines. Same as the closet door.

The smell is stronger now. Not just in the hallway. It is everywhere. Like it has seeped up through the floorboards. Last night I set up an old webcam in the living room, pointing at the hallway stairs (someone suggested cameras). I reviewed the footage this morning. Nothing on screen. Just static quiet. But around 3:17 a.m., the audio picks up a single, wet breath. Long inhale, slow exhale. Like something standing just out of frame, watching the camera back.

I haven't gone back under the house. I don't think sealing it kept anything out. I think it just pissed it off.

I'm sleeping in the car tonight. Parked down the driveway with the doors locked. The house lights are on, radio low. I can still see the windows from here.

If this is what staking my claim looks like, I don't know how much longer I can hold it.

Thanks to everyone who commented. I tried. Really. If you've got anything else, I don't know. Just tell me.
