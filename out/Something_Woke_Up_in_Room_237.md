I’ve always believed certain places absorb energy. Not just haunted castles or graveyards, but places where a lot of people pass through—airports, train stations… hotels. Especially hotel rooms.

See, I used to work night security at one of the poshest hotels in Dublin City. Five stars, marble floors, high-end clientele. That kind of place. You’d think nothing dark could touch it. But let me tell you, money doesn't stop the weird shit from creeping in.

It started around 2:17 AM. I remember because I was mid-yawn, flipping through the camera feeds, when the front desk patched a call through to security.

A man’s voice. Panicked. Breathless.

“My wife’s in the bath. I think she’s not breathing.”

I snapped upright. Me and this other guard, Mark, rushed to Room 237 on the 8th floor. The hallway was dead quiet. The kind of quiet that feels wrong, like the building itself is holding its breath.

We pushed in. The guy was pacing around, soaked from the waist down. The bathroom door was wide open. I’ll never unsee that moment.

She was in the tub, completely still. Water up to her shoulders. Eyes open, but not seeing.

We dragged her out. Tried CPR. I was counting compressions under my breath while Mark gave breaths. Her skin was cold. Like—not just chilly—cold, like touching stone. I knew it was too late, but we had to try.

Police arrived within minutes. The moment they stepped in, they told us to stop. One of the officers pulled me aside and said quietly, “She’s been gone a while. A couple hours, at least.”

The husband told them they’d argued earlier. He stormed out, came back, saw her in the bath, assumed she was just soaking, and went to bed. Said he only got suspicious when she didn’t join him.

No obvious signs of violence. No water overflow. No witnesses. They couldn’t charge him. But between us—staff, cops, even the paramedics—we all felt it. That gut pull. That *something’s off* feeling.

He checked out the next morning. Quiet. Calm. Not a single tear.

Room 237 was locked off for three weeks.

Housekeeping deep-cleaned every inch. Management said, “Accidents happen. Life moves on.” They reopened the room like nothing happened. No priest. No sage. Nothing. Just fresh linens and a new bar of soap.

The first person to stay in that room after the death was this woman named Liz. She was a regular—corporate client, stayed at least once a month. She always asked for a high-floor room. She got 237 without knowing a damn thing.

Next morning, 6:50 AM, she’s at the front desk with her suitcase and this look like she’d seen hell.

I was walking past when she said, loud enough for guests to hear, “That room is haunted. I didn’t sleep a second. Something’s *wrong* with it.”

She said she kept hearing dripping water all night. Not just from the bathroom—like it was coming from the *walls*. At 3 AM, the taps in the bathtub turned on by themselves. Full blast. She walked in and turned them off, soaked her slippers. Then, five minutes later, the shower started. She swore she hadn’t touched anything.

She said she kept smelling something… floral. Like old roses, but rotten. Like death wearing perfume.

We offered her another room. She refused. Said she was checking out for good. Never came back.

After that, Room 237 got a reputation—internally.

Guests kept requesting room changes after one night. Some didn’t even last that long.

There was this German businessman who called at 1:03 AM, whispering like he didn’t want someone to hear: “I think someone is in my bathroom.”

I asked if he saw anything.

“No,” he said, “but someone is coughing. A wet cough.”

I went up. Bathroom was empty. But the floor was damp. Towels crumpled in the corner. The toilet had been used—seat up, water moving like it had just flushed. The guy hadn’t gone in all night. He checked out the next morning without breakfast.

A honeymoon couple stayed there once. The woman came down at 4:12 AM in her pajamas, crying. She said she saw a pale woman standing at the foot of the bed. Dripping wet. Not moving. Just… staring.

Her husband didn’t see anything, but he confirmed the room temperature dropped *ten degrees* in minutes.

I checked the thermostat. It was set to 23°C. The room was at 14.

No windows were open.

I started dreading that room.

Even walking past it gave me this tightness in my chest. Like I was being watched. I’d make rounds and literally speed-walk past it.

Once, I was reviewing CCTV around 2:20 AM—same time the original call had come in—and I saw something weird. The hallway camera outside 237 glitched. Just for a second.

But when I paused the footage and zoomed in… there was a shadow. Not a person. A shape. Just outside the door. Like someone was standing there, pressed against it.

I replayed it a hundred times. Mark saw it too. “It’s probably compression error,” he said.

But his voice shook when he said it.

Management refused to shut the room.

They said we’d get sued if we told guests. “Unless you see something tangible, it's superstition.” So we kept assigning the room. But we started calling it *The Bathtub Room* behind closed doors.

The cleaners hated it. They’d go in pairs. Even when nothing moved, the mirror always fogged up on its own. Once, one of the maids, Rosa, swore she saw the words *“Don’t leave me”* written in the steam. But when she called her coworker over, it vanished.

Guests who stayed more than one night? Always complained of water sounds. Dripping. Running. Gurgling. Sometimes crying. One guy swore his sheets were damp every morning. Like someone had gotten in the bed wet.

Then came the worst night. 3:08 AM. We get a call from Room 237. The guest was an old man, solo traveler. Very logical, very composed. He said, “Someone knocked on my bathroom door from the inside. Not once. *Three times.*”

I sprinted up. When I opened the door, the room was empty.

But the lights in the bathroom were flickering. Not just flickering—*buzzing*. And the bathtub faucet was trickling. Just enough to hear.

That’s when I noticed it.

There was water. Not just in the tub. It was on the floor. In a straight line. Like footprints. Leading from the bath… to the bed.

But no one had walked. No one had opened the door.

I put in my resignation a week later.

Mark lasted a month more. He said he heard a woman humming in the elevator when he was alone. Hummed the same tune for three floors. When the doors opened, no one was there.

Room 237 is still open, as far as I know.

They just keep painting over the mold and turning the mattress.  
But something lives there now. Or maybe something never left.  
Not every hotel room starts off haunted.  
Some of them *become* haunted.  
And I was there when it happened.
