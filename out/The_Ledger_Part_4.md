I stopped smiling.

My reflection didn't.

I left the apartment. Didn't lock the door. What was the point? Nothing could hurt me now. Not really. The protections Ashmedai had given me weren't protections at all—they were accelerants. Every ward, every sigil, every blessing had been designed to make me more receptive to what I was collecting.

More permeable.

More divine.

The streets were empty. Three in the morning. The city looked different now. I could see the layers beneath the concrete and glass. Could see the old boundaries, the places where reality was thin. Could see the debts written into the architecture itself—buildings constructed on broken promises, roads paved over mass graves, monuments to forgotten gods who still whispered in the foundations.

Everything owed something to something else.

The whole world was just one massive ledger.

And I was learning to read it.

My phone buzzed. A text from Ashmedai: "Office. Now."

I didn't respond. Just walked. The distance didn't matter anymore. I thought about being there, and my next step took me through a fold in space that shouldn't exist. I stumbled slightly—still not used to it—and found myself standing outside the building.

The door was already open.

Ashmedai was at his desk, writing in a ledger that wasn't the Ledger. This one was older. The pages looked like they were made from something that had once been alive.

"You spoke to the Throne," he said without looking up.

"You knew I would."

"Of course. It was part of the design." He finished writing and closed the book. "You're angry."

"You've been using me."

"I've been preparing you. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

He finally looked at me. His eyes were the same as always—ancient, patient, knowing. But now I could see what was behind them. Could see the vast intelligence that had been orchestrating this for decades. For centuries.

"Sit down," he said.

"No."

"Then stand. But listen." He leaned back in his chair. "Do you know what happens when a god dies?"

"The Throne told me. Reality collapses."

"Not immediately. First, there's a period of decay. The laws that govern existence begin to fail. Entropy accelerates. Time becomes unstable. The boundaries between dimensions dissolve. It takes approximately five years from the moment of death to total collapse."

"And God is dying."

"God is already dead. Has been for three years. We're living in the decay period right now. You just haven't noticed because someone has been holding things together."

He gestured to himself.

"You."

"Me. And others like me. The old powers, the ones who remember how reality was constructed. We've been maintaining the infrastructure, keeping the laws in place, preventing the collapse. But we're not strong enough to do it permanently. We're patches, not solutions."

"So you need a replacement."

"The universe needs a replacement. A new prime mover. A new source of order and law. Someone who can rewrite the fundamental rules and make them stick."

"And you chose me."

"I chose your mother first. She was perfect—brilliant, compassionate, strong-willed. But she refused. She saw what it would cost and decided she'd rather die human than live as something else." He paused. "So I waited. And when you were born, I knew. You had her strength but not her sentimentality. You had the capacity to do what needed to be done."

"You killed her."

"No. Cancer killed her. I simply didn't intervene. I could have saved her, yes. But her death was necessary. It made you desperate. Desperate enough to take a job you should have run from. Desperate enough to keep collecting even when you knew something was wrong."

I wanted to hit him. Wanted to reach across the desk and break his neck. But I could feel the power in him now—vast and old and patient. He'd let me try. Would probably find it amusing.

"How many others?" I asked.

"How many what?"

"How many other candidates? How many people have you done this to?"

"Seventeen, over the past two thousand years. You're the only one who's made it this far. The others either died during collections or refused to continue once they understood what was happening. You're special. You have the perfect combination of desperation, competence, and moral flexibility."

"Moral flexibility."

"You do what needs to be done. Even when it costs you. Even when it hurts. That's what makes you suitable."

"I'm not going to do it."

Ashmedai smiled. "Yes, you are. Because the alternative is watching everyone you've ever known dissolve into chaos. Because you've already absorbed too much divine essence to go back to being human. Because deep down, you want this. You want the power. You want to matter. You want to be more than just another desperate accountant drowning in debt."

He was right.

I hated that he was right.

"How much time do I have?"

"Two years until the transformation is complete. But the collections will accelerate. Each one will transfer more essence, more power, more divinity. By the end, you'll barely remember being human. You'll think in concepts that don't have words. You'll perceive time as a single unified structure. You'll be able to rewrite the laws of physics with a thought."

"And if I refuse? If I stop collecting?"

"Then the essence you've already absorbed will tear you apart from the inside. You'll die screaming, and reality will collapse six months later. There's no walking away now. There's only forward."

He opened a drawer and pulled out the Ledger. Set it on the desk between us.

"Three more collections," he said. "Three more debts. After that, you'll have enough essence to stabilize. Enough power to begin the transition consciously instead of letting it happen to you. Enough control to decide what kind of god you want to be."

I looked at the Ledger. It was glowing now. Faint, but visible. The pages seemed to shift and move even when closed.

"What are the debts?"

"The first is simple. A minor deity who's been avoiding payment for six hundred years. The second is more complex—a collective debt owed by an entire bloodline. The third..." He paused. "The third is me."

"You owe a debt?"

"Everyone owes a debt. Even me. Especially me. And when you collect it, you'll understand everything. You'll see the full design. You'll know exactly what you're becoming and why."

He pushed the Ledger toward me.

"Take it. Read the entries. Decide if you want to save the universe or let it die."

I picked up the Ledger. It was warm. Alive. I could feel it responding to my touch, recognizing me as something more than human now.

I opened it.

The first entry was written in fire:

*DEBTOR: Qayin, the Wanderer*  
*DEBT INCURRED: Genesis, Chapter 4*  
*AMOUNT OWED: The Mark*  
*PAYMENT DUE: Immediately*  
*LOCATION: The place where the first city fell*

I looked up at Ashmedai. "Cain? You want me to collect from Cain?"

"He's been wearing the Mark for six thousand years. It's kept him alive, kept him protected, kept him wandering. But the Mark was never his to keep. It was a loan. And the loan is due."

"What happens if I take it?"

"He dies. Finally. After six millennia of walking the earth, he gets to rest. And you get the Mark—the first protection, the original ward, the seal that says 'this one is mine.' It will make you untouchable. Nothing in creation will be able to harm you."

"Where is he?"

"Chernobyl. He's been there since the reactor melted down. The radiation doesn't hurt him. Nothing does. But he's tired. He wants to die. He's just been waiting for someone strong enough to take the Mark from him."

I closed the Ledger. "When do I leave?"

"Now. Tonight. The longer you wait, the more unstable you become. The essence needs to be balanced. Needs to be integrated. Each collection helps with that."

I stood up. Started toward the door.

"One more thing," Ashmedai said.

I turned back.

"Miriam has been asking questions. Digging into things she shouldn't. You might want to talk to her before you go. She's going to try to stop you."

"Will she succeed?"

"No. But she'll try. And you'll have to decide what to do about that."

I left the office. Stepped through space again—getting better at it now—and found myself outside Miriam's apartment.

She opened the door before I could knock.

"I felt you coming," she said. "You're different. More... present. Like you're taking up more space than you should."

"Ashmedai told me you've been investigating."

"Come in. We need to talk."

Her apartment was covered in papers. Research. Diagrams. Timelines. She'd been mapping out the collections, tracking the pattern, trying to understand what Ashmedai was building toward.

"You figured it out," I said.

"Most of it. Enough to know you're in danger. Enough to know we need to stop this before it's too late."

"It's already too late."

"No. There's always a choice. Always a way out."

"Not this time. I've absorbed too much. If I stop now, I die. And if I die, reality collapses."

She stared at me. "He told you that."

"The Throne told me that. And I can feel it. Can feel the essence inside me, pressing against my skin, trying to expand. If I don't integrate it properly, it'll tear me apart."

"Then we find another way to integrate it. We don't let Ashmedai control the process. We don't let him turn you into his puppet god."

"I'm not going to be anyone's puppet."

"That's what they all think. That's what every person who's ever been manipulated by power thinks. Right up until they realize they've become exactly what they swore they'd never be."

She grabbed my arm. Her hand was warm. Human. It felt strange now—like touching something fragile and temporary.

"Listen to me," she said. "I've been researching the other candidates. The seventeen people Ashmedai tried this with before you. Do you know what happened to them?"

"They died or refused."

"No. They transformed. All of them. Every single one became something divine. But they didn't become gods. They became servants. Bound to Ashmedai's will. Trapped in a hierarchy they couldn't escape. He's not trying to create a new god. He's trying to create a new pantheon with himself at the top."

"That's not what he said."

"Of course it's not. He's a demon. Lying is what he does."

"He's not a demon. He's—"

"What? An angel? A fallen power? Does it matter? He's been manipulating you since before you were born. Everything you think is your choice has been carefully orchestrated. Every decision you've made has been the one he wanted you to make."

I pulled my arm away. "I need to go. I have a collection to make."

"Don't. Please. If you do this—if you collect from Cain—you'll cross a threshold you can't come back from. The Mark will bind you. Will make you part of the old covenant, the old law. You'll be locked into a system that's been dying for six thousand years."

"The system is already dead. I'm just trying to build something new."

"With Ashmedai's tools. Following Ashmedai's plan. Becoming what Ashmedai wants you to become."

She was right. I knew she was right. But I could feel the essence inside me, burning, demanding to be used. Could feel the pressure building. Could feel time running out.

"What do you want me to do?" I asked.

"Come with me. I know someone who can help. Someone who can extract the essence without killing you. Someone who can give you a real choice."

"Who?"

"Another candidate. One of the seventeen. She survived. She found a way to keep the power without letting it consume her. She's been hiding for three hundred years, but she'll help you. I know she will."

I thought about it. Thought about walking away from Ashmedai, from the collections, from the path that had been laid out for me.

Thought about my mother's journal. About her warning.

Thought about the Throne's favor, still waiting to be called in.

"Where is she?"

Miriam smiled. "Prague. The old Jewish quarter. There's a synagogue there that exists in seven dimensions simultaneously. She lives in the spaces between."

"How do we get there?"

"The normal way. We fly. We can't risk using your abilities—Ashmedai will track you if you fold space. We need to move quietly."

"He'll know I'm gone."

"Let him know. By the time he figures out where we went, we'll already be protected."

I looked at the research covering her walls. At the timelines and diagrams and desperate notes. She'd been working on this for months. Had been trying to save me before I even knew I needed saving.

"Okay," I said. "Let's go."

We left that night. Took a cab to the airport. Bought tickets with cash. Miriam had fake passports—good ones, with stamps and wear that made them look legitimate. She'd been planning this for a while.

The flight was eight hours. I didn't sleep. Couldn't. The essence inside me was restless, angry at being contained. I could feel it pushing against my ribs, trying to expand. Could feel my perception shifting, time becoming less linear, more fluid.

Miriam noticed. "Hold on. Just a few more hours. She'll be able to help."

"What's her name?"

"Dvorah. She was a rabbi's daughter in the 1600s. Ashmedai recruited her during a pogrom. Promised her the power to protect her people. She collected for him for five years before she realized what he was doing. Then she ran."

"How did she survive?"

"She made a deal with something older than Ashmedai. Something that existed before the current god. It extracted most of the essence but left her with enough to stay alive. Enough to stay hidden."

"What did she have to pay?"

Miriam looked away. "Everything. Her name. Her face. Her ability to be remembered. She exists, but she doesn't leave an impression. You'll forget her the moment you look away. The only reason I can remember her is because she gave me a token—a piece of her original self, preserved before the deal."

"That's not surviving. That's just a different kind of death."

"Maybe. But it's better than becoming Ashmedai's puppet."

We landed in Prague at dawn. The city was old—older than it looked. I could see the layers now, the centuries stacked on top of each other like geological strata. Could see the ghosts of buildings that no longer existed, the echoes of people who'd died centuries ago.

The old Jewish quarter was in Josefov. Narrow streets. Ancient synagogues. Tourists everywhere, taking photos of the cemetery where graves were stacked twelve deep because there'd been nowhere else to bury the dead.

Miriam led me to a small synagogue I'd never heard of. It looked abandoned. The door was locked, but she had a key.

Inside, it was dark. Cold. The air smelled like old paper and candle wax and something else—something that made my teeth ache.

"She's here," Miriam said. "In the spaces between. You'll need to look sideways. Not directly at anything. Let your perception shift."

I tried. Let my eyes unfocus. Let the divine essence inside me guide my vision.

And I saw her.

She was standing in a corner that shouldn't exist. A fold in space where the walls met at an angle that violated geometry. She was old—impossibly old—but her eyes were young. Bright. Aware.

"You brought him," she said. Her voice came from everywhere and nowhere. "The latest candidate."

"He wants out," Miriam said. "He wants to keep his humanity."

Dvorah looked at me. Through me. Into me. "No, he doesn't. He wants the power. He wants to matter. He wants to be more than human."

"That's not true," I said.

"Isn't it? You've been collecting for months. You've absorbed essence from dozens of entities. You've felt yourself becoming stronger, more aware, more capable. And you've liked it. Haven't you?"

I didn't answer.

"I can extract the essence," she said. "Can pull it out of you and store it somewhere safe. But it will cost you. You'll go back to being human. Weak. Mortal. Ordinary. You'll lose the sight. You'll lose the protection. You'll lose the ability to perceive the true nature of reality. Is that what you want?"

I thought about it. Thought about going back to being the person I was before—desperate, drowning in debt, invisible to everyone who mattered.

Thought about my apartment with its cold spots and moving shadows.

Thought about the collections. About standing before ancient powers and making them pay.

Thought about the Throne's words: "You will be magnificent."

"No," I said. "That's not what I want."

Miriam grabbed my arm. "Don't. Please. You're not thinking clearly. The essence is influencing you. Making you want things you wouldn't normally want."

"Or maybe it's showing me what I've always wanted. Maybe I've been lying to myself about who I am and what I'm capable of."

"This isn't you."

"How do you know? You've known me for six months. You don't know who I was before. You don't know what I've always been."

Dvorah smiled. It was sad. Understanding. "He's already chosen. The moment he absorbed the first piece of essence, he chose. Everything after that has just been momentum."

"There has to be another way," Miriam said.

"There is. But he won't take it. Because it requires sacrifice. Real sacrifice. Not the kind where you give up something you don't want anyway. The kind where you give up everything you've ever wanted and become less than you are."

She looked at me. "I can make you human again. But you'll remember what you were. You'll remember the power, the perception, the ability to stand before gods. And you'll spend the rest of your life knowing you gave it up. Knowing you chose weakness over strength. Can you live with that?"

I thought about my mother. About her choice to die human rather than become something else.

Thought about her journal. About her warning.

Thought about the reflection in my mirror, smiling with a smile that wasn't mine.

"No," I said. "I can't."

Miriam let go of my arm. Stepped back. "Then I can't help you."

"I know."

"Ashmedai wins."

"Maybe. Or maybe I win. Maybe I become something better than what he planned. Maybe I take the power and use it my way."

"That's what they all think."

"Then I'll be the first one who's right."

I turned to leave. Dvorah's voice stopped me.

"One warning," she said. "The Mark of Cain is not a gift. It's a curse. It will protect you, yes. But it will also isolate you. You'll be untouchable. Unreachable. Alone. Forever. Is that what you want?"

"I'm already alone."

"No. You're lonely. There's a difference. Loneliness can be cured. Aloneness is permanent."

I left the synagogue. Stepped out into the morning light. Miriam didn't follow.

I folded space—didn't care if Ashmedai tracked me anymore—and went to Chernobyl.

The exclusion zone was empty. Abandoned. Nature had reclaimed most of it—trees growing through buildings, vines covering roads, animals wandering through what used to be homes.

The radiation was everywhere. I could feel it now, see it as a kind of shimmer in the air. It should have been killing me. Would have killed me six months ago.

Now it just felt warm.

I found Cain in the reactor building. He was sitting in the control room, surrounded by instruments that no longer worked, staring at screens that showed nothing but static.

He looked up when I entered. His face was ancient. Weathered. Tired beyond measure.

"Finally," he said. "I was beginning to think no one would ever come."

"You know why I'm here."

"Of course. You're here for the Mark. Here to take the burden I've been carrying since the beginning of time." He stood up. "Do you know what it's like? To live for six thousand years? To watch everyone you've ever known die? To see civilizations rise and fall like waves on a beach?"

"No."

"It's exhausting. I've been tired for five thousand years. I've been ready to die for four thousand. But the Mark won't let me. It keeps me alive. Keeps me protected. Keeps me wandering."

He walked toward me. I could see the Mark now—a symbol burned into his forehead, glowing faintly, pulsing with power that predated language.

"Take it," he said. "Please. I'm begging you. Take it and let me rest."

"What do I have to do?"

"Just touch it. The Mark will recognize you as worthy. Will transfer itself to you. And I'll finally be free."

I reached out. Hesitated.

"What happens after?" I asked.

"After what?"

"After I take the Mark. After I become untouchable. What happens to me?"

Cain smiled. It was the saddest thing I'd ever seen. "You'll understand why I've been begging for death. You'll understand what it means to be truly alone. And you'll spend the next six thousand years wishing someone would come and take it from you."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I keep wandering. Keep waiting. Keep hoping. And you go back to Ashmedai without the protection you need. Without the power you need. And you die during the next collection."

He was right. I knew he was right. The essence inside me was unstable. Growing. I needed the Mark to contain it. Needed the protection to survive what was coming.

I touched the symbol.

The world exploded.

Not physically. Metaphysically. I felt the Mark transfer—felt six thousand years of protection, of isolation, of divine mandate flow into me. Felt it burn itself into my forehead, into my soul, into the fundamental structure of what I was.

Felt it change me.

Cain collapsed. His body aged six thousand years in six seconds. Skin turning to dust. Bones crumbling. Until there was nothing left but a pile of ash and a smile of pure relief.

I stood there, feeling the Mark settle into place. Feeling it integrate with the essence I'd already absorbed. Feeling it make me more than human.

Feeling it make me alone.

I could sense it now—the barrier between me and everything else. The untouchable space that surrounded me. Nothing could hurt me. Nothing could reach me.

Nothing could touch me.

I was protected.

I was isolated.

I was alone.

I folded space and went back to the office. Ashmedai was waiting.

"You have the Mark," he said. Not a question.

"Yes."

"How does it feel?"

"Like you knew it would."

He smiled. "Good. You're learning. You're understanding what you're becoming. What you have to become."

He opened the Ledger. Turned to the second entry.

"The next collection is more complex. A bloodline debt. An entire family has been avoiding payment for three hundred years. You'll need to collect from all of them simultaneously. Forty-seven people spread across six continents. You'll need to fold space multiple times. Need to be in forty-seven places at once."

"I can't do that."

"Yes, you can. The Mark gives you that ability. You're untouchable now. Unreachable. You exist slightly outside of normal causality. You can split your attention, your presence, your self across multiple locations. It will hurt. It will feel like you're being torn apart. But you'll survive."

"What's the debt?"

"They made a deal with a minor god three hundred years ago. Promised their firstborn children in exchange for wealth and power. They've been avoiding payment ever since—moving, changing names, hiding. But the debt is due. And you're going to collect."

"All forty-seven firstborns?"

"No. Just their lives. Their essence. Their potential. It will be enough to stabilize the divine power inside you. Enough to prepare you for the final collection."

"The debt you owe."

"Yes."

"What did you promise? What debt could someone like you possibly owe?"

Ashmedai closed the Ledger. "That's for you to discover. When you're ready. When you've collected from the bloodline and integrated their essence. When you're strong enough to understand what I am and what I've done."

He handed me a list. Forty-seven names. Forty-seven addresses. Forty-seven people who had no idea what was coming.

"You have twenty-four hours," he said. "After that, the debt expires and the power destabilizes. You'll die. Reality will collapse. Everything ends."

I took the list. Looked at the names. Saw families. Children. People who'd never asked for this. Who'd never made the original deal. Who were just unlucky enough to be born into the wrong bloodline.

"This is wrong," I said.

"Yes. But it's necessary. The universe doesn't care about right and wrong. It only cares about balance. About debts paid and contracts fulfilled. You're learning that now. You're understanding what it means to be divine."

"I'm understanding what it means to be a monster."

"There's no difference. Gods are monsters. Monsters are gods. It's all just a matter of perspective and power."

I left the office. Stood on the street. Looked at the list.

Forty-seven people.

Forty-seven lives.

Forty-seven pieces of essence that would make me more than human.

More than mortal.

More than anything I'd ever imagined.

I thought about my mother. About her choice.

Thought about Miriam. About her warning.

Thought about Dvorah. About her sacrifice.

Thought about Cain. About his six thousand years of isolation.

And I thought about the Throne's favor. Still waiting. Still available.

I could call it in now. Could ask the Throne to stop this. To break the cycle. To free me from Ashmedai's plan.

But the Throne had said I'd need it later. Had said I'd know when the moment came.

Was this the moment?

Or was there something worse coming?

I looked at the list again. Felt the Mark burning on my forehead. Felt the essence inside me, demanding to be fed. Demanding to grow.

Demanding to become.

I made my choice.

I started collecting.
