Ever find yourself jobless, angry and fed up? If not, I envy your life. 

Unfortunately, that’s the state I find myself in. 

Worked at a grocery store for about a decade, customer decided to get rough with one of the other employees over some god-damned baby formula. One punch later, they’re getting a couple hundred dollars in gift certificates not to sue, and I’m out the door. 

I’d say ‘ funny how life works’ but there’s nothing funny about my situation. 

So here I sit, combing through reddit for some horror to take my mind off my impending financial doom. Watching 80’s slasher films when that gets old, and re reading my Stephen King collection of course. 

It'd be a good life if I wasn’t sneaking ever closer to starvation. 

One day though, I get a chat request. I accept it, and see a phone number. 

My first thought is that it’s for some kind of ARG. So wallowing in shame, worry and boredom, I give it a call. 

“Thank you for calling project insomnia, how may I direct your call?”, an upbeat female voice says. 

“Got sent this number on Reddit, wondering what everything is about.”, I reply. 

“Good for you! I’ll connect your call.”, the voice replies. 

After a few minutes of hold music that’s exactly as you’d expect, someone answers. 

“Nathan, glad you decided to call. I’ve heard you’re looking for employment and enjoy horror, am I correct?”, a professional sounding man says. 

I’m a little weirded out. I’m not the type to use my name ( of course that isn’t my name, but a stand in, but I’m sure you all know that.) online much. And I certainly haven’t been posting about my financial state ( till this anyway.).

But, people who run ARGs can get really into the weeds, so I don’t think much of it. 

“Right on both accounts, why?”, I reply. 

“We have an opportunity for you. Two weeks of your time, using your skills, 20K.”, the voice says simply. 

“God, I could use that money in real life. But hey, this will keep my mind off of things while I wait for some answers on resumes. Sign me up.”, I answer. 

“Nathan, I think you’re misunderstanding. We’re not running any kind of game. I’m offering you money for your time.”, The voice sounds mildly annoyed. 

“…Really? I’ll bite, what’s the catch? Is this some kind of MLM, pyramid scheme, what’s going on?”, I ask. 

“Details can be given in person. I’ll send you a location, we can meet and see if you feel the job is a good fit. 

I’d request you bring a suitcase in case you feel like taking us up on our offer. There are many other people who have been chosen, and time is a factor.”, the voice explains. 

I get some mild BS vibes from his statements, but it’s not like I have a full schedule. 

A couple of days later, I find myself in a small diner a couple of towns over, sitting with a man in a plain black suit. 

He doesn’t seem nervous, but there’s a vigilance in his eyes. Like he’s used to watching out for things.

 “Glad to see you’ve made it. You wouldn’t believe how hard it is to get people to believe we’re paying 20 grand.”, The man in front of me says. 

“I would, I’m waiting for the part where you tell me it’s split up over a decade and requires a 5k deposit. 

Before that, could I know who I’m talking to?”, I ask. 

“You can call me Adrien.  And I assure you, what I’m offering is real. By the end of this meeting, if you so choose, I’ll have the money in your account.”, is Adrien’s reply. 

There’s some silence, a waitress comes over. 

“Anything I can get for you two?”, the middle-aged lady asks. 

“Coffee for myself, and a clubhouse sandwich with fries for my friend.”, Adrien replies. 

I’m not shocked that he knew what I’d order, more amused. Whoever these people are, they’ve dug into me. 

“You’re trying really hard to cultivate a mysterious aura. It’s working though, so what’s the job?”, I say. 

“Simple really, we want you to watch horror. Lots of it, for extended periods of time, and give your observations.”, Adrien says. 

“Is this some kind of AI training shit? I’m not that desperate.”, I reply. 

“No, Nathan, you will be watching real people. Nothing artificial about it. 

But I know the question you’re really asking. Why are we offering you so much money for something you do every day while you hope to get a call back from the sanitation office or a McDonald’s. 

The answer is not going to be as exciting as you think. 

Your accommodations are going to be rather spartan. Somewhere between a small apartment and a prison cell. We need secrecy and a high volume of participants, hence the arrangement.”, Adrien explains. 

My food comes, I feel like I’m under a microscope as I eat. Adrien’s eyes dissecting my every movement. 

“So this is some kind of test run I’m guessing? Halloween themed attraction at an amusement park?  You’re paying for me to shut up about it more than anything.”, I question. 

Adrien gives a half-shrug. 

“Close enough for government work. 

So, what’s the verdict? I’ve got two more people I have to see tonight.”, Adrien offers sliding over a small stack of papers and a pen. 

I read through the contract, smirking a little, “This is some Mckaney manner stuff here Ade. Like this part about ‘consenting to methods of encouragement that may lead to physical harm’, you can’t sign away your rights against assault. So clearly you guys aren’t going to be knocking out anyone’s teeth.”

Adrien smiles, “No one in organization has any intent to put hands on you. 

Astute observation though.”

“If you want my opinion? Remove those parts, just let people imagine what bad things could happen. 

But all the real bits seem in order. 

So, what about my money?”, I ask. 

The grin Adrien gives me should have been my warning sign. But I was too busy getting a notification of 20 thousand dollars in my nearly empty bank account. 





“Jesus Murphy, you weren’t kidding were you? It’s like someone tried to turn a submarine brig into a bachelor pad.”, I say looking around the small room. 

There’s a bed with thin sheets, a large desk with a few dozen monitors, and that’s about it. Enough room to maybe do some push-ups, but nothing more. 

One thing I notice right off of the bat is how the monitors are constructed. 

Thick, textured plastic leads to the wall, locking each of them in place. They’re hardwired into the electrical system, the plugs being reinforced and grounded behind the wall. 

There’s a small vent in the ceiling doing it’s damndest to minimize the musty odor of the place. 

The toilet is what I’d expect, stainless steel and industrial. But at least it’s clean. 

The door gives me pause. Thick, steel, and with a slot in the middle. 

“If the project takes off, maybe we will look into making the workspaces more comfortable.”, Adrien offers. 

“Not like you could make it any less so. 

But hey, 20k makes it seem a lot bigger than it is, am I right?”, I reply. 

 “Meals are served three times a day, we’ve not found any dietary restrictions in our research on you, but if you have any, feel free to let us know. 

You may keep your cellular device, but usage in most cases will be seen as contrary to the rules outlined in the contract. 

Once daily you will be expected to give a report on what you’re seeing on the monitors. Attention to detail is key.”, Adrien explains. 

“Okay, so this is kind of like a ,Night Trap meets escape room situation?”, I say, sitting down in a small computer chair looking at the bank of various monitors. 

“There’s that attention to detail we’re looking for. 

Watch the monitors Nathan.”, Adrien says, closing the steel door.

Want to know what I’m feeling? Joy.

 Yeah, everything is grimy and eerie as hell, but it’s supposed to be. I’m Alpha testing something or other, an immersive horror game maybe. 

I light up a cigarette and immediately notice two things. 

The first is that all of the monitors are showing three different places. About a half dozen screens a piece, give or take. 

The second is just how varied these screens are. Some are crystal clear, some are antiques, but all are behind a layer of almost imperceptible bulletproof glass. 

How do I know it’s bulletproof glass? I don’t, but it’s clear, I can’t scratch it, and I can’t leave a scorch mark on it. 

Most of the monitors are dull, a fast food place, a gas station and the inside of a house. 

After a while though, someone comes home. A nice looking lady, early thirties or so, smartly dressed and coming home late at night. 

I’ve been watching paint dry for hours, I’m instantly drawn to anything resembling action. 

“What the hell am I doing here?”, I say, frustrated as I watch her through an impeccable screen. 

The house is dark, her kitchen lights obscure the background. Shadows play like feral cats in her Mcmansion. 

I yawn, wondering when dinner is, or for that matter what time it is. 

Then I see it, on one of the older monitors. Could just be glitches from the ancient tech, but I swear it’s a pair of eyes. 

Subtle, well done, it makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 

But as quickly as they appear, they’re gone. 

The woman turns, looking to where the apparition once was. As she does her fridge door closes. Whether of it’s own accord, or something else is unclear. 

“Nice.”, I say, complimenting the scare. Theatre or no, my heart’s racing. 

Boring hours flow by like water in a dangerous lake. I’m brought something they assure me is dinner. Meatloaf, heavy on the loaf, nearly green, green beans and cornbread I debate on keeping to whittle. 

At least the coffee is decent, and given to me in a two litre carafe. 

I look away when the woman starts changing. I’m starting to think this is live improv, and meeting someone after I’ve seen them naked, seems gross. 

One lamp on a desk lights her as she places modest jewelry in expensive cases. There’s a noise, a keening wail, and the woman turns around, seeing nothing. We’re in the same boat. 

That is, until I look at a smaller, black and white monitor. Standing in front of the woman is a rotten, lanky spectre, torn asunder, and enraged. 

“Right in front of you!”, I scream, but she can’t hear me. 

The objects in the room rattle. It’s enough to scare the wits back into the woman. She bolts to her bedroom door. 

The thing, that mournful thing grabs her by the arm. A sleeve of the woman’s housecoat crumbles, the flesh beneath it beginning to wither. 

She tries to pull free, but the grip of the spectre is immovable. 

She hammers down a hand, and somehow after three frantic blows, the spirit lets go, growling in rage. 

The woman gets distance between herself and the ghost, but the undead doesn’t bother to move. 

Small furniture flies like it’s been caught in a tornado. Windows rattle and fracture, sending broken glass in waves onto the carpet. 

The woman takes a wrong step, lacerating her foot, she holds onto a banister for support. 

The ghost laughs, the woman rises as if she’s been picked up by one leg. 

She’s screaming now, begging, blood pours from her torn foot into her eyes. 

   The spirit dangles her in mid air. Her arms begin to twist and warp, snapping and breaking. I try to cover the speaker, but it’s no use, I hear her pain. 

For a moment she’s still, then, defenceless, she falls. 

The feed on that set of monitors cuts out, and I’m jarred back to reality. Sweat beading, nails digging into the armrests of the cheap chair. 

“Well done guys, I’m not usually one for ghost stories, but that was, damn near worth the time.”, I say to whoever is keeping tabs on me. 

A few more hours of staring at the screens and there’s a loud klaxon. Jarring in the small room. The monitors shut off, and a pre-recorded voice says, “Now begins your ten hour rest period.”

There’s a handful of reasons I have trouble falling asleep, not the least of which is the amount of coffee I’ve had. 

A close second though, are those noises. I’ve watched everything from Psycho (great) to A Serbian Film (horrible) and not once has audio stuck with me so much. 



I’m woken by that same eardrum punching tone. Before I can brush the sleep from my eyes, a breakfast is shoved through the slot in the door. It’s about as well made as dinner was. 

More coffee, and half a cigarette later, I hear a voice from an unseen speaker. 

“Hey, um, Nathan?”, the voice says, I can hear paper rustling. 

“That’s me.”, I reply. 

“Hi,  call me Percy. I’ll be asking you a few questions about what you watched the previous day. 

If you have any for me, by all means, let me know.”, the voice is level, friendly. 

“I was expecting Adrien, to be honest.”, I say. 

Percy laughs, “This is a little below his paygrade. I’m just a guy working a job, like yourself.

Bit nicer digs, but I’m also not making 2k a day.”

I smile. 

“So, what do you want to know?”, I ask. 

“Well, I’d like for you to give me your overall impression of what you’ve seen. With particular attention to things that stood out, or may have seemed odd.”, Percy replies. 

“The format is neat. You’d think it’d get obnoxious, but those actors you hired, and those effects, make it worthwhile. 

I’d cut down a little on the dead air though.

The ghost was scary, especially the wounding around the face, unique is probably the right word. 

The sound effects blew me away.

One thing though. Why did the ghost let go when that lady hit her? Didn’t make any sense. Maybe if she hit it with, a bible or something, but as is, I don’t know, kind of killed the vibe. Seemed a little lazy or silly.”, I explain. 

“Good catch Nate. I’ll have the higher ups have a look into that. 

Not a bad way to earn a few grand, eh?”, Percy replies. 

“It’d be better if I wasn’t hanging around with the ghosts of my own farts, that vent  isn’t doing a damn thing.”, I joke. 



The next three days go by in much of the same way. I scan the monitors till something spooky happens and do my best to point all of the plot holes and stupid things I find. 

Not that there’s much to pick apart. The variety alone makes things worthwhile. I’m seeing ghosts, demons, a couple of slasher villain types, and a handful of different creatures. Despite the sponge baths, and stale air, it’s honestly a dream job. 

But I wouldn’t be posting here if the dream didn’t turn into a nightmare. 

Day 5 shows me what this place is really about. 

Breakfast comes, the same as always. A dish I dub Greyggs. Due to their color and my love of a good portmanteau.

I answer some questions on the last thing I watched, (some kind of monster fight club. Seemed way too action oriented. More like fantasy than horror really.) and get ready for another day. 

My selection consists of an empty barn, a deep forest and…

“Adrien, I said in the interview, no AI bullshit. I’m out, open the door, and if you want your 20k back, you can see me in court. I’m not going to be part of the downfall of art.”, I say. 

No reply. 

My issue is, I’m recognizing one of the places I’m watching on a set of monitors. 

Kumar’s Comics. Now, I’m not much of a geek, but I’ve been known to buy a comic or two. And while I’m not in there every day, I know the owners well enough. 

Kumar and Jaspreet Patel. A little over middle aged and the kind of folks that truly love what they do. 

There is no way, other than some kind of generative special effects I’m watching them. 

“Guys, I’m serious.”, I say. I try to sound enraged but, I hear the anxiety in my voice. 

“It’s 20k.”, I whisper to myself, justifying tossing my artistic morals to the wind. 

The more I watch, the more people I know I  see, the more I’m actually impressed. I hate saying anything good about AI, but if I didn’t know better I’d swear I was actually watching cameras hidden in the shop. 

The longer I watch the more I think that this can’t just be some kind of special effect. 

I try to shake the thought, but as the hours slowly tick by, it’s all I can think about. 

But, what can I do? How could I prove things one way or another?

My hand starts to move toward my phone, a plan forming. 

The second I grab it, a loud speaker-distorted voice hits me like a slap in the face. 

“Nathan, do you know much about firing squads?”, Adrien says. His voice calm.

“What? No, why?”, I stutter. 

“In any firing squad, one man is given a rifle loaded with a blank. None of them know who.  

The reason why, is that certain actions carry a weight. One that’s too heavy to carry for most. No matter how noble the intention. 

It leaves that sliver of doubt that maybe you didn’t really do anything.  It’s how most members of a firing squad sleep at night. 

If you make that phone call, it’s only going to make things harder for you. Cling to that doubt, cling to it like a life raft. “, Adrien explains. 

“What are you saying?”, I ask. Panicked. 

“As little as possible, for your sake. 

And I have to remind you, using your device to communicate is against the rules of your contract and will be dealt with.”, Adriene threatens. 

I feel like I’m on the edge of a cliff. On one hand, I know this is all just some game. Spooking me out is the point. 

But on the other, a lot of things aren’t adding up. 

I dial the number, I hear the ring echo through the monitors. My heart drops, I feel sick to my stomach. 

My phone disconnects, when I look down, I don’t even see the “for emergency calls only” prompt, just a string of strange illegible characters. 

I hear Adrien sigh, then the speaker cuts out. 

A few seconds later, the industrial toilet/sink combination starts spewing water. 

It goes on for minutes, soaking everything in the room and leaving about 3 inches of standing water. 

I’m shivering, scared, and I understand how truly fucked I am. 

“Watch the monitors Nathan. You may not understand, but you’re helping to save life as we know it.”, Adrien demands. 

What else can I do? 

The day slowly trickles by, every customer, every shadow makes my heart stop. 

Around 11pm, Kumar and Jaspreet begin to close down the shop. I think maybe they’re safe. Is this just another of the feeds where nothing happens?

No one likes being proven wrong, myself included. 

The door wasn’t locked. A short, stocky man in a dragging raincoat and beat up fedora walks in. 

“Sorry buddy, store’s closed. Open up bright and early tomorrow though.”, Kumar says. 

The man ignores him. The stranger’s faded plaid coat catches on a set of action figures knocking them over.

“Sir, show a little more care, please.”, Jaspreet says, nicer than necessary.

The stranger laughs, mockingly. 

I catch an angle of his face. Pale, rotund, and full of small lesions. They look almost like burns. 

But as he grins, I see it. Each of his teeth are small clusters of wire. 

“Get out, fucking run!”, I scream at the screen. But of course they can’t hear me. 

I know what this guy is, or at the very least what he’s capable of, I can’t just sit here. 

But what choice do I have?

Yesterday, I’d have probably said he’s the worst thing I’ve seen. He’s not really scary, and his gimmick seems tacky. 

The thought makes me sick to my stomach. The callousness I’ve viewed peoples trauma with. 

I vomit, the noise it makes in the standing water makes me retch a second time. 

“Okay, Dick Tracy, time to get out of my store before I call the cops. You have ten seconds.”, Kumar says in a commanding tone. 

The stranger snickers again, then turns to Kumar and his wife. 

I don’t speak Hindi, but the squat man does. What he says shocks Kumar enough he picks up the phone and dials 911. 

Of course, there’s no dial tone. 

The lights flicker, then dim, then go out completely. 

Kumar and Jaspreet use their phones as a light, trying to find their way to the door. 

They reach it, but it doesn’t budge. Kumar begins to rattle the door. 

There’s an electric arcing sound, then above them, is a twisted grin made of arching wire. 

I don’t catch much of the violence, by the time the stranger sinks his teeth into Kumar, they both dropped their phones. 

The feed cuts out, I feel light headed, like nothing is real. 

But it is, all of it. I just watched people I know get killed by a c-list urban legend. 



I don’t sleep, by the time I hear Percy, I’m staring angrily at a wall. 

"Hey, I've got about ten seconds to talk. 

You need to think about this like getting drafted into a world war. It sucks, it’s going to change you, but it’s for the fate of the world.    “, Percy says, his voice panicked. 

“Why the hell are you doing this, why are you killing people?”, I scream. 

“ We’re not. Every place you’re watching is the result of months of research, and even then it doesn’t always pan out. 

But the higher ups, they don’t fuck around. 

Do your time, get out. Don’t let anything get in the way of that.”, Percy pleads. 



From then on out, things don’t feel interesting, or exciting. Knowing what I know, the violence hits home, it fucks with my head. 

The worst are the stupid ones. The kind of things I’d share with my friends for the sole purpose of mocking the writer. Something about a creature or spirit that can be accurately described as cringeworthy, taking someone’s life is shocking and dismal. 

Then there’s the cell itself. After the first day of standing water spots of mold and veins of mildew start to develop on the walls. 

A couple of days after that, I’ve got a cough that won’t quit. It’s my second concern beyond what I believe is a case of trench foot. 

Things are miserable, torture really. 

By day ten it’s all I can do to focus on the screens in front of me. I’m running a fever, one of my toes is turning a foul shade of green. 

That morning’s breakfast comes with a familiar looking stack of papers. 

I laugh, then cough, I see blood in the phlegm. 

It’s a contract, another two weeks of my life to have the water drained and some antibiotics. 

Of course there’s another 20k in it for me, but at this point I’d burn the god-damned money just to get out of here. 

But truth be told, I don’t know if I’m going to last another four days without medical attention and air without spores in it. 

I sign, of course I do. It’s not like I have a choice. If it was a case of being shot, maybe I’d be brave enough to face the music instead. But the thought of dying a slow, infected death in this sodden cell terrifies me. 

There’s no happy ending here. I’m still in this cell, day 13 in fact. 

The first day since the 5th I’ve seen a familiar place. 

My cell. 

It sits, perched  in a corner of the room, looking down at me from the ceiling. I can’t see it when I look, but on an old, green-tinted monitor it lurks. 

I can’t make out much of it besides what I think is a rusted old army helmet. It’s long, brass teeth reflect the scant light in the cell. 

Water is flooding my prison as I finish typing this, a punishment for reaching out to all of you. 

This is my cry for help.  My scream to the void to try and figure some way out of my situation. 

But this is also my warning. Something is happening in the world, something big, and chaotic, and worse than anything we’ve seen before. 

Rules are breaking, logic is failing, things aren’t what they seem. 

And someone, somewhere out there is keeping an eye on all the Reddit threads and Youtube comments, looking for those people that know what they’re looking for. Those of us who live and breath urban legends and ghost stories. 

Watch your back guys. I don’t know what else to say.
