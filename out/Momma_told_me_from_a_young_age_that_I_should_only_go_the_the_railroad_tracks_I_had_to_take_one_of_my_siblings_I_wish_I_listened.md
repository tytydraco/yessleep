Gettin' muddy and dirty with my two brothers to annoy my Momma and older sisters was my main thing when I was little, oh how I wish I still had that. I wish I had listened to Momma. I don't even know how much time I got left because I didn't listen, so I'm gonna tell ya why ya shouldn't go to the railroad tracks alone.

I always thought Momma tellin' us to not go to the railroad tracks alone was to make sure none of us youngins got hit by the trains rollin' into town, but as I grew older, I think when I was age twelve, she explained it to me more.

She told me, "don't go to the railroad tracks alone Josie, take one of your siblings, preferably Dicky or Colton, they can handle the things out there better than yer sisters. Ya see hun, there's things on those tracks that ya couldn't even imagine, some pretty dangerous things." She paused for a moment to take the kettle off of the stove and pour herself a cup of tea.

"Those things out there make ya see things, make ya think things, make ya scared, make ya regret goin' alone," she continued, I didn't take her warnin' seriously because I was still growin' up and I was quite rebellious at twelve. That time I went to the railroad tracks I took my older brother Colton because she knew I'd sneak out if I didn't bring one of 'em, and I'd be in a lotta trouble with her.

Those tracks did nothin' whenever there was more than one person on 'em. A couple of years later, at age seventeen, which happens to be now, I found out what they do to ya when you're alone though, and now I'm payin' the price.

Now let's get to when I was headin' to the tracks. It was yesterday, I think, I'm not completely sure now, when I had gone out to find some of my friends to hang with, but since all my girlfriends were busy doin' their shoppin' day, I started walkin' around 'cause I got bored, and I just so happened to stumble up around them tracks, and might I say, my curiosity got the best of me.

You know what they say, curiosity killed the cat.

I looked around to see if there were anybody to catch me goin' to the tracks, there weren't nobody near, I mean, most people were either inside or going about their day in their cars 'cause it was supposed to rain some time later in the day.

 Since there weren't no one, I grinned from ear to ear, I could finally do what I was never told to do, and I stepped onto the tracks. Once I stepped onto them, nothin' felt any different than before, so I started to walk down them, lookin' around hopin' to find something cool. I betcha I was walkin' for about an hour until I found somethin'.

I looked down and there was this odd lookin' skeleton, it looked to be about my size but the bottom half was a contorted mess between human legs and a fish tail, it looked disgustin'. I continued down the tracks ignorin' the disfigured skeleton, it gave me the creeps but I just thought it was some of the highschool boys playing a prank on the locals.

I walked for a while more and I didn't see a damn frightenin' thing. That was until I saw somebody farther up the tracks, it was only a shadow of a person from where I was standing. The odd thing about it though, it looked like it was walkin' straight towards me, but the closer I got to it, the farther away from me it was. By that time I started to get a little unsettled but I still wanted to see what the trouble was with them tracks.

That shadow didn't disappear the entire time I was walkin'. More like it was changin' shape the farther I got. It started out as human, was that way for a good half hour or so, but then its legs started to get shorter as its arms got longer, until it was walking on its arms instead of its legs.

Now at this point I thought I was just hallucinatin', thought the heat was gettin' to me or sumthin, but it was makin' me pretty scared, but since I had gone almost outta town before I got onto the tracks, I still had a decent way towards home, so walking the tracks back was my only option, it was the only shaded area away from the rain, there were them big pine trees all around. 

Now it was maybe another hour later when the shadow started to become a clear figure. It was this purpley-grayish kinda color, it's arms weren't arms anymore, them things were like giant spider legs, but as arms. Where it's legs were was some kind of contorted mesh of meat and skin. The skin of its face and torso were rottin' away, its eyes were hollowed in, the nose gone, and the mouth this ugly melting flesh of a thing with pearly white teeth with a couple of sharp fangs in its mouth.

Since I could see it clearly now, it was way too close. I decided I needed to turn around and run, and with my heart racing a million miles a minute, I did. And that's how we ended up here, I don't know how far away I've gotten from it, I don't know how much time left, but I know it's still coming for me, I can hear the arms and the groaning from it's ugly mouth. 

I'm really sorry Mama, I should've listened, I love you
