*Editor’s Note:*

*My name is Tabitha.  The following is my transcription of an audio recording I made a year ago of Charles REDACtED at The Barnacle Bar and Restaurant in Laird Beach, Oregon.* 

*That was when my friends and I made a road trip to Laird, like so many others did after the video of The Lights first went viral.*   

*I almost didn’t go.  The others gave me shit for wanting to tag along.  “Why would you want to come look at lights you can’t even see, Tabs?”  That was Darryl, I think?  It doesn’t matter, now.*

 *Whoever said it was referring to my myopia.  Commonly referred to as nearsightedness.  I’m not legally blind, but close to it.  The answer to that question was simple—I was always fascinated by life on other planets.  The Roswell Crash.  The Phoenix Lights. The Pentagon ‘UAP’ (I hate that name, by the way) Videos.   If I were there in person for those events, I wouldn’t have seen them. But with the aid of the Internet and some corrective lenses, I can look at videos and photos of such things as often I want.*

 *As for the Laird Lights.  Seeing those nebulous, ethereal, blue wisps in the video (before it was taken down), and knowing I could be there with the hundreds of fellow seekers flocking to see them—even if I couldn’t--as they continued to shine over that small coastal town was an urge I found impossible to ignore.  My friends didn’t need much convincing—especially once I promised to buy the first round of drinks when we arrive.* 

*I figured it would be a prime opportunity for my journalism degree—utterly worthless it seemed at the time—to be put to good use.  I could interview people, record their accounts, see through their words, and thus learn all I could about the Lights through their firsthand retellings.* 

*The first—and only—person I interviewed at Laird Beach was Chuck.  I had an old school cassette recorder one of my old professors insisted be used for all interviews.  Digital recordings could easily be altered, he said.  Physical recordings, not so much.* 

 *The real benefit of using the recorder for Chuck's interview proved to be that, when they started tracking down people who had been there and were confiscating any and all recordings of what happened, they were looking for phones.  Computers.  Cameras.  Not tiny cassette tapes.  I was able to sneak it past them by…well, by hiding it somewhere the soldiers didn’t bother checking.  Let’s leave it at that.*

*It took me a while to get up the courage to listen to it.  Even more to transcribe it.  Maybe I’ll figure out a way to convert the recording to digital, but all the friends I would have asked to help with that aren’t exactly available.*

 *I’ve removed all of my statements, as well as the drunken ramblings of my friends.  This isn’t really my story to tell.  It’s Chuck’s.  And I want him to be the one to tell it.*

*Some might say this will shed more light (no pun intended) on how this all started.  Maybe this will change things.  Or maybe they’ll take this down as soon as its posted.  We shall…well.  We shall see.*

 *Eyes down out there. Be safe.*

 *PART ONE*

 No one worried much after the first boat vanished. 

When the second boat never returned, though?  That’s when we started to get concerned.  And that was before everything actually started.

 See, the thing is, people sleep on us Oregonians when it comes to the trade—industrial fishing, that is, for those *not* in the trade.  Everyone thinks of one of two places—Massachusetts, thanks to that sappy movie with George Clooney, or Alaska, on account of that godawful reality entertainment show which, I don’t mind telling you, I find to be neither realistic nor particularly entertaining.  Real fishermen—or rather, real fisherpeople would be the proper nomenclature these days (not that I have a problem with that, mind you)—we know the trade is a lot different and a helluva lot harder than that show and others of its ilk.  Twice as fun, too, in my humble opinion.  Those fellas always seem too high strung.

 Anyway—where was I?   Right.  Oregon.  Pacific fishing.  Not only are we one of the largest commercial fishing hubs in the country, but one of the most diverse as well—salmon, shellfish groundfish, we’ve got it all.  Plenty of fish in the sea—literally. I’m not talking about the local dating scene.

 …no?  Nothing?  Alright. Dad always told me “Chuck, you’re the son of the son of a fisherman, so get rid of those fancies of being on Leno.  Also, my boy, you’re just not fucking funny.” 

 Ok, ok, “get to the point, Chuck,” I hear you.  I know why you’re here. Context is king, though, as they say. Mind getting me another beer, kid?   The local brew, second tap from the left.  Might be less prone to veering off road, so to speak, with a tad more lubrication.  Ah, there you go, thank you kindly, my good lady.  No, no need to hand it to me.  I’ll take it when I’m ready.

 What I’m trying to say, is, there’s more than enough fish for everyone out there. Normally. And here in Laird Beach, on our humble speck of rock and sand here in the Northern end of the Beaver State, we do pretty damn well—again, normally.  I use that word again on purpose, because typically you’d have to put in a real effort to miss a good haul.  Go in any direction for a fair amount of time, and you’re bound to catch something.  We never had to go all that far out nor for terribly long to bring in big money.

 This most recent season, though…no matter how far off the coast our boats traveled out, every damn one returned with holds no less clean and just as empty as when they left.  I realize you folks aren’t in the trade, but I hope I don’t have to tell you that the two worst things for a commercial boat’s hold to be are clean and empty.  What made it odder is the writing wasn’t on the proverbial wall.  There was no steady decline.  No warning signs.  One season, we’re raking it in.  The next, poof, there isn’t a single shitting leaf to rake. 

 Thus we come, gentlepeople, to the first boat.  Once it became clear, very quickly, there were no fish to be found in the usually spots, Dale made his way to the The Barnacle—yes, the selfsame esteemed establishment we find ourselves in now—which basically doubles as both Laird Beach’s nightlife and townhall.  Place started getting a hell of a lot busier a heck of a lot earlier in the day since there weren’t no fish to catch—you’d think it would be the opposite, but even the least thrifty of us made enough in seasons past to be able to drink our way through Laird Beach’s first ever dry spell.  Dale knew that’s where everyone was trying to cogitate on possible solutions and next steps. 

The younger folks, like the J boys, wanted everyone to appeal to the Internet, the Social Media and whatnot, put our story our there—the mass disappearance of marine life, a fishing town’s supply inexplicably turning barren overnight?  They figured that would draw attention from the right people.

 Others, I would say the more evenkeeled crowd, they don’t really get the online stuff, they suggested going to the Gulls—that’s trade slang for the NOAA, otherwise known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Yep, the feds, specifically the federal agency responsible for overseeing wildlife fisheries.  The reason behind that idea, according to Kathy, one of Laird Beach’s premiere fisher*people* (hell, she’d be probably prefer being called a fisherman, she certainly could take most of Laird Beach’s male population in a fight), was that the Gulls—so monikered for the agency’s silly-ass mascot—would be able to figure out *why* all the local oceanlife suddenly decided to up and vamoose without so much as a kiss goodbye. 

Problem with that idea is twofold: one, the same problem with any fed—maybe, at some point, the Gulls would be able to come up with a ‘why’, but there was no guarantee they’d offer any real solution.  If anything, it was likely that the Gulls would lock down all fishing activity, indefinitely, until they found a solution.  If they ever did.  Two: problem number one assumes there are enough people employed by the federal government, and by the NOAA in particular, to give two hoots or less about little ol’ Laird Beach.  Which—and this ain’t being political, this is just being objective—there probably aren’t.  Enough agents, that is.  Not enough hoots.

Plus, whether the World Wide Web or the Gulls, the simple fact of the matter is this, if you haven’t caught on yet—we here in Laird Beach don’t like to advertise just how good the trade is here.  For years, the fish practically jumped into our boats, that was just the way it was.  We’re small, but we’re also, by and large, rich, or damned close to it.  We didn’t need every young dreamer with goals of seeing the world and a hope of making a buck flocking to our shores.  As for the Gulls, well…the reports they got in seasons past may or may not have been entirely accurate.  Accurate enough to avoid suspicion, but not too accurate as to clue them in as to how good its been here.

 What’s that?  I just “admitted to defrauding the federal government?”  Young lady, do I look like I give two fucks?  Another beer, on you, if you please.  Yes, I know I haven’t touched the last one.  But I’ll need to later on, and would prefer to continue our tale unimpeded.  Yes, yes, much obliged, ma’am.  Can you all understand me clearly, by the way?  No reason, just making sure I ain’t slurring my words. 

 Tell you what—I’ll cut down on the non sequiturs, if you lot cut down on the interruptions.  Do we have an accord?  Very good, very good.

 Thus, with the stage set as to the concerns of the Laird Beach citizenry at large, in walks Dale with a plan. 

 “We’ve had it easy”, Dale tells us.  “The solution is staring you square in the face.”  Dale’s a small man, 5’5 on a good day, and as I may have implied, was generally known as a bit of a goody two shoes.  For this shrimp of a man to all of sudden belt at us in a voice and volume that would make an Irish father blush, it caught us all off guard.  But it worked.

 Dale seemed surprised himself, at himself, for a split second. But he didn’t lose any steam:

“We’re so busy worrying about answers and help from outside sources. Why don’t we help ourselves?”  Dale then ambled right over the big window over—yes, right behind you, little miss high and mighty narc—and throws the shutters open.  There sat the coast, the ocean empty of all the boats that usually occupied it—and the horizon.  The deep sea herself.

“We’ve been spoiled”, Dale tells us.  “No one came in the middle of night and stole the damned things”, Dale railed.  “They moved.  To get away from us, who all got fat and lazy off of them for years.”

 Dale’s face was as red as his hair at this point—all of us were captivated.  “So how about we get off our lazy asses, do what God means for us all to do, and *go as far out into that damn ocean as we need to in order to catch some damn fish!”*

 I would love to you that a slow clap ensued, one by one, among the Barnacle’s patrons in response to Dale’s speech. But it didn’t.  We were captivated by Dale, like I said, but we sure as shit didn’t agree with him.  The fact of the matter was no one, not a single soul in that bar or anywhere else in our little town, no matter how young or how old, how experienced or how green they were, ever fished that far off the coast.  We were coast fishers, not deep sea fishers.  We never had to go that far out.  We didn’t need to. So far that season, every single person in that bar had gone as far out as anyone ever had in Laird Beach, and every single one came back with the same thing—nothing.

It was denial, I think—instead of looking to the unknown for answers, we were waiting for the known to come back.  Even though the known appeared long gone and in no rush to return.

We were all silent—the J Boys were uncomfortably shifting in their seats, Kathy was trying her damndest to look in any other direction, and Big Jim, who had heretofore been staring at Dale with rapt attention, was picking a stubborn booger out of his left nostril with the attention and intensity of a bomb squad technician.

Ken--the captain of the vessel I worked on--was the only one with the sense to speak up, something along the lines of “sorry, Dale, but….” until Dale shot him a look that shut him up real quick.  The small man was beet red and shaking—nah, not shaking, *quivering*—with undisguised disgust until he took a few deep breaths. 

I think everyone in that room knew Dale Pettson wasn’t done yet.  That’s why none of us bothered following up on Ken’s swing-and-a-miss to try to cut the tension, nor went over to calm Dale down a notch or ten.

 “Equal shares.”

 Dale was still looking down at his hands when he said that.  He looked up, snapped to attention, as if realizing he had just said that out loud.  He gazed at each and every person in the bar defiantly.

 “Equal shares!”  Dale roared. “No matter your age, experience, or usual position. No matter what we get or how much of it we come back with. I don’t care if we’ve worked together before or not.  I’m going out there, right now.  Alone, if needed.  Room for three more.  Fully provisioned and ready to roll, as far out as we need to.  Then even further, if ‘need to’ doesn’t work.”

 With that, Dale  departed The Barnacle without so much as a glance back.  Although—this may be revisionist history, mind you—he seemed to pause just for second, if that, by the J boys’ table.   For effect?  To pass along a silent message?  Because he knew that, out of all the people crammed in The Barnacle, his spiel was most likely to work on them?  Probably a little bit of all the above.

 Here's all you need to know about the J boys—first, they’re brothers.  But everyone calls them the *boys*, not the brothers—even though two of the six were in their early thirties.  That should tell you a lot, right there.     



Second, they were so monikered because their parents slapped a different Biblical name starting with 'J' as soon as they popped out of their mama.  Their folks probably would have spawned even more kids except for the fact that the youngest, J.J., did lasting damage on the way out.  J.J. was only seventeen, and was the spitting image of the other five manchildren—blonde, beefy, entirely neckless, each with half-assed tattoos on various limbs of some Gaelic pattern or some shit. Goons you don’t want to grapple with, but if you’re spry and got good reach, shouldn’t be in all that much trouble if they try to fight you.  Which they were wont to do.

 As soon as Dale left (after that possibly deliberate pause at their table), it was a veritable feeding frenzy for the J Boys as they clambered and collided to be the first three to get those crew spots.  J.J., being the youngest and the only sober of the bunch, was the first to scrape free from the others—only to be stopped by Henry, a 30-something father of two with a helluva solid reputation in town and a black beard twice as long.  Henry was the current chair of the town council, and had his own boat, which was by all accounts a great vessel to crew on.  Could J.J. have taken him?  Probably.  But then the rest of us would have been on him in a heartbeat, which would have likely led his brothers to join a brawl, by which point Dale would be halfway across the pacific. 

So what did J.J. do?  Nothing.  Without a word, one hand still on the kid’s chest, Henry downed his beer, grabbed cash out of his pocket and left it on the table.  Then he left.  Simple as can be without a second thought for J.J.  The little schmuck was so stunned, two of his brood—Jacob and Joseph, I think, but I honestly couldn't tell you for sure—ran right past him. 

After a moment of stunned silence, most of us started laughing and got back to business as usual.  One of J.J.’s remaining brothers—Jonah, I can name him with confidence, as we’ve crewed together on a few boats in the past, and currently worked on the same crew—barked laughter, clapped his little brother on the back, and guided him over to the bar. 

 Bev, the bartender, let J.J. ogle her tits while Jonah—her boyfriend for awhile now—charmed her into letting him buy a beer, despite his own drink barely being touched, with the clear intent of giving it to his little brother.  As a high school dropout with no car, J.J. was not someone anyone was particularly concerned about with regards to underaged drinking.  Even Ricky, Bev’s dad, the Barnacle’s owner, and the other bartender on duty, probably wouldn’t care, but the old codger was virtually blind as a bat, and apt to not even notice.  Bev, though, knew what Jonah was up to, and went along with it.  Poor thing was head over heels for Jonah, and would probably do darn anything he asked her to do.

 And there you have it—Dale.  Henry.  The J Boys who followed him—maybe it was Joel and Joshua?  Nah, those two come later.  Jacob and Joseph, I’m sure of it.  That was the captain and crew of the first boat, Dale’s *Five and Two.*  A boat that was nothing to speak of, nor anything to write home about, that no one bothered seeing off from the dock.

The general consensus was that the *Five and Two* would circle back after a few days. Dale and Henry were as ill-equipped for deep sea fishing as the rest of us, and the two J Boys were just ill-equipped, period.  

If they came back with something, most of us believed they’d come back with at least a few good hauls, but nothing that made the trip worth it. It would likely take some time for them to find a good spot, make any adjustments to what they were used to off the coast, and catch what they could. That would’ve been at least 72-hours, or probably as long as a week, at most.  Maybe even more, if Dale was serious about going as far out as needed and then some.

 A lot of the fisherfolk who had decided not to follow Dale had all dug themselves pretty deep into that ditch named denial.  They continued to take their boats out to the usual spots off the coast, only to come back empty handed.  Some of us—yours truly included—has already started moving down the coast to other spots.  But the problem there was the same problem others have when they try to drop anchor in Laird Beach—we fisherfolk are a territorial lot.  If too many of us went to other spots, we would draw to much attention to our own predicament, plus earn the rancor of the other communities. 

So it went with my crew—well, not *my* crew.  You thought I was a captain?  Nah.  I’ve worked all sorts of positions in my 40-odd years, but never got my own vessel to captain.  In the time around when the Five and Two went missing, I had already been first mate on Ken’s ship, *Cascadey Lady II*,  for a few seasons.  Ken and I have been pals forever, and worked our way up various crews together over the years.  Gale was the engineer, Jonah and an old codger named Otis were typically the deckies. Mari rounded out the crew as the fish cutter.  

Just a few nights before Dale’s big moment, Ken had furloughed Jonah, who had taken to spending so much time at The Barnacle it wasn’t much of a change of scenery, and he didn’t much care as he got to spend more time with Bev.  But the day before Dale set off, Ken had also furloughed Otis, with Mari picking up the slack for the deckies.  Otis made no secret of his objection to this decision, and even tried to spread vicious rumors that he got furloughed instead of Mari because the latter was enjoying a torrid affair with the first mate.  Here’s the thing—he was partially right.  Indeed; Mari and I were enjoying each other’s company, but it weren’t no affair, since it wasn’t a secret, nor was it particularly torrid, except for special occasions.  

But the real reason for the furlough was Otis was a down-and-out drunk.  Otis had been spending just as much time at The Barnacle as Jonah, only his attention there was exclusive to the bottle, and not Bev.  The only reason Otis had seniority over Mari, and over most of Laird Beach, was by account of his dual occupation as the town boozehound.  That put a damper on his career prospects in an already small market.  Hell, if it weren’t for that seniority, Ken would have shelved Otis before Jonah, who honestly was an all-around better deckie.

 All that being said, all of us from the *Cascadey Lady II* had gotten pretty close over the course of multiple seasons, and we were proud to call each other friend. And yes, in Mari and I’s case, we were more than friends.  Gale and Ken rounded out our group, with Jonah being the newest member, and even dumb ol' Otis being, well, tolerated.  Nice enough guy when he was well and truly lubricated, miserable when not, and a generally shit fisherman all around. 

Otis had once gotten into trouble for barrel fishing—that’s explosive barrel fishing, yes, seriously, young lady—once, well before my time.  He had been treated as a pariah ever since then until Ken hired him on. Thus, Ken’s decision to furlough Jonah then Otis was certainly not an easy one, by any means.

Once the *Cascadey Lady* started venturing further south, we finally began eking out a profit.  A couple other boats followed suit, but as predicted, the trade folk down there started getting possessive, *en masse*, so we had to limit the amount of boats going down there.  We’d draw lots before each trip at The Barnacle to see who got to go south and who would be stuck in Laird Beach. 

 Two days after the *Five and Two* left, Ken drew a low lot.  He decided it wasn’t worth going out to the usual spots—they had been bone dry the day before.  There isn’t much to do in Laird Beach when you’re not fishing, besides drinking, and it was too early for that (for everyone not named Otis).  Ken and Gale decided to work repairs on the boat while Mari and I opted to go to the beach.  Oregon beaches are rocky, and the Pacific is cold as shit, so there typically aren’t many people there, since there isn’t much to do at the beach except walk along it until you stub your toe and call it day.

However, when Mari and I arrived, there were easily a dozen or more people--some of the elderly residents who gave up the trade, a few of the spouses left on shore to watch the kids, teens too young and green to be hired on as crew, and some of the other low lot drawers, including a veteran fisherman named Billy REDACTED.  

Everyone was gawking at the ground, pointing at various things on the ground—fish.  Shocking, you may think to yourself sarcastically, but you’d be right.  These weren’t just any fish, and weren’t the kind that brought in money.  These were fish that would be designated ‘bycatch’ if a boat trapped them in their nets—fish that were government protected or otherwise not eligible to be caught, and had to be thrown back.  Weird fucking things too—one was just a gelatinous mess of flesh, another looked like a giant gray pancake.  Mari suggested calling Ken and Gale on the cell to come look, since they knew fish better than we did, but it took a few tries for the call to go through.  Reception was sometimes spotty at the beach, but it still took more attempts than usual.   Everyone there were making similar complaints, with the younger crowd yammering about how they were having issues sending the photos they were taking with their phones to other people, or how they weren’t able to get an Internet connection to post them online.  Eventually I got through to Gale, who came down while Ken stuck with the repairs.

Gale’s a quiet sort who only spoke when there was something to say, usually something about the boat’s engine or some scientific tidbit about the ocean or the marine life within it.  A stout, dark man with a shock of white hair and close-cropped beard, Gale’s face was locked in a perpetual scowl.  I had made it my mission over the years to try to break that scowl into a smile, with minimal success. 

When Gale came down to the beach, he looked around, then slowly whistled.

 “Never seen anything like this, guys.”  Gale said.  “That’s a Hoodwinker Sunfish there”—he pointed to the pancake—“that’s a Blobfish there”—pointing to the jelly-looking thing.  “A Sunfish washed up here back in ’03, but Blobfish are real deep-sea creatures.  Never heard of them washing up in Oregon before.”

 Gale continued to walk down the shore, pointing at each washed up fish like a kid at the zoo seeing wild animals for the first time.  He jogged over to where a large crowd had gathered around something large.  Gale pushed his way through, and waved Mari and I over. 

 “Oh, god!”  Mari covered her mouth and made a gagging noise.  Gale nodded tersely.  “Yep.  Everything smells rank, but this is by far the rankest.  I’d say he’s at least 30 feet, maybe more.  Wouldn’t you say, Chuck?” 

 I nodded.  The subject of our discussion was a silver-colored, twisting, thick-bodied, eel-like creature.  It had reddish-pinkish fins and spiky protrusions along one side of its contorted body.  An odor I could only describe as pungent overpowered all other smells emanating from the other dead denizens of the beach.  I turned to Gale.

 “What the hell is it?”

“A giant oarfish.”

“Well, which is it?”

“What?”

“Is it a giant?  Or a fish?”

 Gale stared at me.

“Better luck next try, Chuck.”  Mari laughed and took me by the arm.  “We’re going to get out of here, Gale.  The smell is really getting to me.”

Gale shook his head.  “Wasn’t funny. I’m going to hang out.  Me and some of the other folks are going to have to figure out what to do with this guy.  And with the rest.”

“Won’t the tide take care of it?” I asked.

“What, so that they can NOT be eaten by NONE of the fish that are around?  No, we’ll have to figure something out.”  Gale ran a hand through his unruly white hair, staring at the ground.  He seemed to be bothered by something—something else besides all the weird-ass dead fish all around him, I mean. 

“I definitely prefer giant oarfish to its other name," Gale muttered thoughtfully.

“What’s its other name?” Mari asked.

Gale looked back up at us, a thoughtful glower plastered across his face.

 “The Doomsday Fish.”

 As we walked back towards town, Billy joined us.  “I was out yesterday, NONE of this was out there.  Especially not that fucking snake thing.  Where’d this all come from?”

“These are all deep-ocean fish, right?”  Mari replied.  “Maybe they didn’t get this close to shore until late last night?”

“THIS much, though?” Billy shook his head. “Not even one of your pal Otis’ ‘weather patterns’ or ‘temperature changes’ can be responsible for that, can they?

Mari shrugged.  “Ernie’s out there today, isn’t he?  Let’s ask them tonight if they’re seeing these out there.” 

We did, later that night at The Barnacle.  Ernie, another low-lot drawer and family friend of Mari, was out trying to fish off the local coast all day.  He said he came up with nothing.  Whereever the fish who didn’t wash up on shore went, they didn’t stick around.

Ernie gaped at the pictures Billy took on his phone of the Oarfish and the other creatures and asked Billy to text them to him.  Damndest thing, Billy wasn’t able to get them to send over to Ernie’s phone.  No signal.  

 J.J. was there with his remaining brothers and said he and the other kids who were at the beach that day had tried to post photos of the fish on social media, but couldn’t connect to the Internet.

 We were luckier the next day.  Ken drew one of the high lots.  It had been three days now since Dale and the *Five and Two* went out.

 It was after pulling one of the low lots that morning that Big Jim declared he was going to follow in Dale’s proverbial footsteps.  Appropriate, given the contrast between the two; Dale was a big man who was slight in stature; Jim, on the other hand, was true to his name in appearance only.  He was otherwise a small, petty bully who regularly had trouble filling out his crew and who almost always performed the worst season after season.  By Laird Beach standards, that is.  Remember, to a person, we had regularly done more than well for ourselves before this year compared to most other folks in trade, as we used to get more fish on our coast than pretty much any other region.  Even the worst of us (Big Jim included) earned at least four times what they would otherwise make anywhere else. 

 Big Jim was too chickenshit to be the first one to venture out into the Pacific.  But when he pulled that low lot three days later, Big Jim started grousing that seeing a pipsqueak like Dale  do it and have yet to come back empty handed didn’t sit right with him.  When Ken reminded Big Jim that Dale had yet to come back, at all, Big Jim just waved him off and said that was probably because Dale was still bringing in big hauls and didn’t want to share.

Now, that didn’t ring true for anyone.  Most of us thought that Dale was still searching for a good haul, or was still getting the hang of things.  After all, deep sea fishing wasn’t a specialty of his, or of anyone’s in Laird Beach.  While it was true that Dale hadn’t checked in on the radio—Ricky kept one at The Barnacle so we could track any major storms or check-in with boats in case of family emergencies that required them back ASAP, like a birth or death—it still hadn’t been *too* long.  Plus, most figured him to still be pretty ticked off at us.  

Big Jim refused to let the truth get in the way of his pride.  The oaf announced he was going out, and—like Dale before him—had room for three spots.  Otis staggered of his stool, but he locked eyes with Big Jim, saw something he didn’t like, and sat right back down.  Three of the remaining J Boys—J.J. and the other two, Jehoshaphat and Jude, I don’t fucking know, whatever I said before was probably right—were in a huddle in the corner.  Jonah and Bev were deep in conversation at the bar.  As J.J. and the other two J Boys went to join Big Jim, Jonah gave Bev a big ol’ kiss, wiped a tear off her cheek, and just like ol' Henry three days prior, stopped his youngest brother with a hand on his chest.  He cracked some joke I couldn’t hear, but the other brothers and Big Jim all started cracking up while J.J.’s face turned redder than an overripe beet.   Jonah nodded at Big Jim, shook his hand, and started to make his way with the others towards the exit while J.J. slinked back to his seat.

Instead of leaving with the others, though, Jonah made a beeline for the corner table occupied by myself and Mari.  He clapped me on the back and shot Mari a wink.  Which, despite Mari’s delighted smile, only instilled the slightest pang of jealousy. 

“Do me a favor, Chuck.”  Jonah said.  “Keep an eye on J.J.  Keep him away from Bev while you’re at it.”

“You don’t have to do this.” Mari interjected.  “Ken said he’ll need you or Otis back if we keep going down south every few days.”

“And lord knows you’re preferable to Otis.” I cut in.  I gestured to Otis who, somehow, already seemed passed out at the bar. 

“It’s not about the furlough, guys.  It’s been three days without a word from Dale or my brothers.”  Jonah shook his head gravely—he was usually a pretty upbeat guy, that’s why everyone liked him so much, but he was dead serious this time.  “I’m thinking we can run into them while we’re out there.”

“Uh, ocean’s a big place, young man.”

“Even so.”

“There’s better people to take you there than Big Jim.”

“Maybe so, Mari.  But I don’t see Ken offering to lend me his boat.  Or Kathy.  Or anyone else.  Do you?”

“Ocean’s still a big fucking place, bud.  They’re in good hands with Henry.”

“Henry hasn’t been on the radio or responded to any of our transmissions in three days, Chuck.  That doesn’t exactly put me at ease.   Plus, I doubt Dale took them out that far.  At least maybe they’ll respond to our radio calls once they’re sure the rest of the town isn’t listening. . .maybe.”

Jonah turned to go but I grabbed him by the elbow.

“Make you a deal, then, Jonah.  We’ll make sure J.J. doesn’t get lost in your sweetheart’s ample bosom, if you make sure you don’t get lost out there.”

“*With the following caveat!”* Mari added. “That you radio in twice a day with your coordinates and any updates you deem relevant.  Including if and when you run into the *Five and Two*."  She paused.  "And whether you find any good spots.” She paused again thoughtfully  “And when you and your brothers mutiny against Big Jim.”

Jonah saluted proudly.  “Yes ma’am!”

“First call in tonight.  Ok?”

“Yes, *ma’am*.”

Big Jim hollered for Jonah somewhere outside.  Jonah gave us one last nod, blew a kiss to Bev, flicked off his little brother, and left.  In that order.  Mari laughed and winked at me.  I tell you what; that wink looked a lot better on her than on Jonah.

Those of us who were fortunate to draw lots had returned with empty holds—the locals down south had grown savvier to our trespasses, and had organized *en masse* to greet us.  Most of the day saw Mari and I shitting around while Ken and the other captains negotiated with the locals.  By the time Ken stormed back to the helm, it was already late in the day, and it was clear that negotiations did not go well.  Mari started to ask Ken what would happen now, and all Ken said was “other than them letting us leave, I don’t know.”

 Eventually, we lot-drawers slunk back to The Barnacle with low spirits, which only got lower for everyone in the bar as people panicked about what to do now that the lot-drawing would be over. 

This sad state of affairs was quickly forgotten when, around 8, Jonah called in on the radio.  There was some static, so people had to quiet down to hear him.

“Do I have to give the boat name, Big Jim?  They know who this is…what?  Ok.  Fine.  *BJ’s Seabitch* to The Barnacle, come in.  *BJ’s Seabitch* to the Barnacle, come in.  Someone answer so I don’t have to say that stupid ass name again.”

A few laughs broke out until shouted at everyone to shut up.  Bev rushed over to the radio to answer, and oh, what a lovely rush it was.

“Barnacle to *BJ’s Seabitch*! HI BABY!  Also, gross.”

“Yeah, hi babe.  I know, our captain is one dirty deviant.  Is Mari there?"

“Everyone’s here, baby!”  There was a tone of jealousy in Bev’s voice.  Mari heard it too.  She barked laughter and slapped my ass.  Bev scowled at her before turning her attention back to the radio.  “Go ahead.”

Jonah gave his coordinates, then laughed.  There was no humor in it.  “You guys won’t believe this.  We’ve got absolutely nothing out here.  Not even bycatch.  It’s like the ocean is lifeless.”

Everyone (well, everyone who was sober enough to understand what Jonah was saying) groaned. 

Otis got up on the bar and shouted “*See?. Water temperature fluctua—flatulate—uh, changes!  That’s to blame!  There’s probably nothing between here and Alaska, at least!”*

Jonah said something but the cheers and laughter drowned him out.  Bev cartoonishly shushed everyone as Ricky helped-slashed-shoved Otis off the bar.  She then asked Jonah to repeat himself.

“I asked what do you guys think of that weird light?  I’ve never seen anything like it before.”

The chatter settled down as everyone looked quizzically at each other.  A few of us looked out the windows.  Some of the folks by the door even stepped outside, only to come right back in shaking their heads. 

“We don’t see anything, babe.”

“You’re kidding.”

“…no, not kidding.”  People started murmuring.  Just how far out could they be in only a day?  Mari hit the mic again.  “Can you describe it?

“Uh, sure, although I don’t know how you’re missing it, though.  It’s a blue…orb?  Ball?  Just up there floating.  Doesn’t really move all that much.”

More murmuring ensued.  A few laughs; Jonah was always prone to a good gag or too, they were probably thinking.  Kathy was the one who shushed them this time—she must have seen the worried expression on Bev’s face.

“This isn’t funny, babe.”

“No, it isn’t, darlin’.”  The rumbling timbre of Big Jim’s baritone voice had replaced Jonah. “But all four of us see it.  Big, round, I’d say…sky blue?  Light blue?  What?  Powder blue?  What the fuck is powder blue, Joel?

A quick break in the transmission, then Jonah was back on.

“Whatever it is, its blue, its not really moving.  Just floating there. 

"Not perfectly round, more..I dunno, round-ish?  Like there’s little blue lights that flare or flick out of it now and then.  But overall its not moving.  Are you *sure* you can’t see it?  It’s so big we all assumed you could.”

The murmuring had escalated to full-blown chatter. Otis had even begun quietly chanting “U-F-*O*!  U-F-*O*!” as the light kept being described.  Otis’ volume grew louder and louder until Ricky smacked him in the back of the head.  “It’s called a *UAP* now, you dolt!”

That elicited a few chuckles, which eventually petered out into uncomfortable, tense silence.

“No…it is moving.”  Jonah continued in response to a question nobody asked.  “It’s kinda going up and down.  But it seems…dead. Moving, bobbing, but...not dead—dull.  It’s not pulsating or glowing.  It’s just…there, but not actively shining or glowing.  Dull, like I said.  Steadily bobbing.”

The laughter and chatter faded away as the bar fell into silence (except for Otis, who was now muttering that all the fish that had vanished were probably abducted by that thing), until Big Jim hopped back on the radio.

“Before anyone asks, I already tried to radio the Coast Guard.  Couldn’t get them on the horn.  I also tried radioing the *Five and* *Two* see if they’re out here.  Bupkiss.  You’re the only signal we can reach.” 

 Another pause.  

“We’re going to check it out.”

 Everyone started clamoring again until Kathy—who was the unofficial boss in town in Henry Lubbock’s absence—grabbed the radio from Bev and roared: “*Now you listen to me to, JAMES!*  Your radio sounds busted, we may have one missing boat with four of our own in danger, and you’re the only witnesses to whatever the hell that thing is.  *You get back here right now, as soon as you can, so we can all figure out what to do.*”

The radio crackled but all we could hear was unintelligible background discussion.  Finally:

“Fine.”  Big Jim said.  “I know what you all think of me.  It ain’t true. I may be an asshole.  But I’m not a bad person.  Just wanted to help these boys find their brothers…young master Jonas actually agrees with you, believe it or not.  He wants to get the hell away from this light.”

 Kathy laid some placating platitudes on Big Jim until Bev snatched the radio back from her and asked for Jonah, who quickly responded. 

Bev made Jonah promise to make sure the *Seabitch* headed straight back for Laird Beach that night. 

Jonah, still sounding perturbed, promised her his safe return. 

Well. It didn’t quite work out that way.

 *Editor’s note: Chuck started coughing uncontrollably at this point and asked for a break.  I figure this is as good of a time as any to take a break from transcribing.  I’ll be back to post the rest in a day or two.*

*Remember, especially for everyone remaining out there on the coast--eyes down.*

 *And if there are somehow still videos out there they haven’t taken down yet?* 

 *Don’t watch them.*
