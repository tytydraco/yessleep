Buddy is a 221 pound, 6 year old English Mastiff who saved me from another year in rehab. Sobering up requires you to not only get out of the hole you placed yourself in, but to also fill that hole with something else. More liquor? Been there, done that. How about drugs? Too hardcore. Sex and rock and roll? Not charming enough. No I needed something else, I wasn't an artist, nor creative and I hadn't written anything in ages. Next stop was back to the bottle, until Buddy came into my life. 

I got him when he was just a pup. Sorry, I should say that he came to me when he was a pup. Just like something out of a fairytale. Like an angel falling from the heavens. A baby with its stork. I had finished the last drop of Absolut in my apartment on the 3rd floor, and then there was the knock. Stumbling from my couch (which I had been planted in for most of the morning) I opened the door to see a small dog sitting patiently on my door step. The carpet enveloping the dog was a cheesy yellow stained by unknown substances. Likely spills from my late nights.

“Where did you come from boy?” I rubbed his long flappy ears clumsily, they felt so delicate and soft on my fingers, like satin. Craning my neck around his drooped chocolate eyes, I came to the conclusion that it must have been a stray. No tag, no collar, nothing. So when I brought the dog inside, I made the place his home. Instantly, it curled up right next to me on the couch, contorting the couch to an odd angle.

“Hey you're a smart one aren't you?” I whispered to him.

The front door swung open presenting my roommate. He was a scrawny lad only a few years younger than me. He had that classic roommate look on his face, you know the one. The one of disgust mixed with prolonged disappointment. He swung his jaw about at the state of the place.

“Dude this place is a pig sty, I'm gone for a few days and-” he paused, taking in the mound of fur that poked his head out over my lap. "Is that a dog?”

“Yeah he's so friendly right? I think I'll keep him.”

“You sure as shit aint it's my house too! Clean yourself up man, I'm not living in a flat with a drunk and a dog the size of a bear!”

I was still pretty wasted at this point so I can't recall the incessant arguing that followed but I can certainly remember the end. At the peak of the bickering came a low howl. A melodic unwavering tone emanated from the dog, immediately halting us in our argument.

After that he stayed. A member of the family. He was our Buddy.

When I say our Buddy, I mean my Buddy not his. He never took care of him, it was all me and I loved him so much. I took him everywhere, however it was difficult to hide that large frame from my landlord, thank God he was deaf which made things easier. Buddy was so smart, I could teach him all kinds of tricks. He could play dead, roll over, he could even speak. I don't mean that he could just bark on command. *He could actually talk.* I'd understand if you don't believe me but it's true. You can teach dogs anything with enough time on your hands and the right methods. So I'd take time off my shitty office job to the point of unemployment to reach my goal, to get him to talk. Here's what I did, I placed his mat under the fridge and opened the door. Not only does this cool the brain down (this helps with cognitive functions for males) but it also provides a warm light (which promotes focus). I know it sounds silly but I provided Buddy with a small speaker which played small melancholic tunes mixed with the audiobook for the Oxford English dictionary.

Every night for 3 years I would continue to repeat this process, I could pay for the extra electric costs and to hell with what my roommate thought, I told him my therapist said it helps me ‘relax past traumas and help recover addictions and all that to try and get him off my ass. All bullshit. Then, on the 16th of August 2003 it finally paid off. Buddy spoke.

It was late at night, the steel blue glow of the tv played some fishing show, while Buddy was deep in his corner in the kitchen. My head was rolled to the side, an empty shot glass was sliding back and forth between my pinky finger and thumb. I was at my lowest point, the bottom of the barrel. Years of my life wasted over some stupid hypothesis. I was about to pour another glass when I swear I could've heard something emanating from the kitchen. *What was that? I heard something, what was it?* Coming out of fatigue on the couch, I heard from the corner of the kitchen the sound of a whine, a howl and a groan. It went something like “Reeehn ooohhh Rooooayyyy.” I immediately pulled the tv cord out from the wall causing the marlin on screen to snap to black and I slid over the tiled floor on my hands and knees, keeping that deafening silence. I was begging him to speak, anything at all. I was in a river of silence, drowning indefinitely, drowning forever until my lungs ruptured and my eyes bulged. I was red in the face. Anything please God anything.

There it was again!

It was deeper, softer this time with every syllable becoming more articulate. I turned, grabbing my notepad on top of the counter and returned to see the giant dog sitting upright, staring with its dark chocolate eyes, mouth agape. Silence…

*‘Kiiiiirrrlll Yore Rooomayye,”* said Buddy, in a low guttural groan. It sounded like an old door slowly opening. Or the rocking of a piece of furniture under strain. Groaning.

I was shocked, now I craved the silence. I didn't want to hear anymore. Something about that tone. He didn't just say that, did he? No it isn't true he didn't say what I think he said he said “Krill is Yummy,” no thats silly he said “Fill your tummy,” some gibberish it had to be. *Stupid stupid dont be stupid you know what he just said.* I was an inch away from him now. His hot breath seeped into my pores sticking to my skin, dribbles of drool swung as he slowly breathed in and out, in and out. He wasn't panting anymore, he was breathing with conformity, and he stared deep into my eyes, His eyes narrowing, his head turned down slightly and we were both eye level now with his teeth. His fangs, sharp and huge. I saw something in his eyes, those eyes weren't chocolate coloured anymore, no they were that of coal, a deep void, dark and endless, derived from something that wasn't to be seen on earth. I needed to get away right then and there. I began to slowly crawl backwards when Buddy spoke those words I dreaded to hear.

*“Kill Your Roommate."*

Finally my work paid off, there was an ingredient that I have been missing to this whole experiment. Liquor. That night was my relapse night, I sure as shit wasn't proud of it but results are results. Obviously he lacked the articulation to pronounce anything more noteworthy than a bark that's impossible. No he wasn't the one who changed I was, I could truly hear him now, I could be his messenger. I've finally found my purpose.

Following Buddy's words he immediately fell back into a brutish form of speech, completely unintelligible. Barks and whimpers and howls returned once more. So as the scientist I thought I was, I quickly came to the conclusion that I needed more liquor as that was the one changing variable in all of this. Besides, after what I heard I clearly needed it. Stumbling back to the couch I picked up my near empty bottle of Jack and finished the whole thing. I wasn't relapsing no, this was a mere experiment. I'm just visiting this time I promise. Before long, I was back into a state of bliss. Crawling back next to Buddy I scrambled to pick up the fallen notebook and attempted to write down the dog’s messages.

“I am a being beyond your understanding, I speak in tongues you cannot perceive. In the heavens and below, I am the snake. The harbinger of the end.”

Buddy then stooped his head down and licked the palm of my open hand.

“Upon this rock will I build my church. If you carry this burden I will make you a king of kings. Gold, Frankincense and myrrh will flow from your hands like waterfalls and you will be that of lordship over your gaze. All that I ask of you is to bow, for me to be your master and when dust settles, you will be a great favourite among my lands."

The liquor made me laugh, it is very hard to take a talking dog seriously with so much in your system. I slumped back into the cabinet adjacent to me, trying to keep my gaze on the mass of fur. A long while flew past as I just stared at the mass, lolling my head side to side, trying not to throw up.

“You're uhhhh,” I chuckled, "you're a very very bad dog aren't you.”

Buddy raised himself, standing on all fours now. I remember his paws so vividly, they looked as if you curled your fist into a ball and placed it flat onto the floor.

“During the miracle of the swine, did those demons become pigs? Or did they remain demons?”

“Buddy you're a dog. I mean like you have paws and stuff. You're not a pig!”

Interrupting our pleasant drunken conversation came my roommate. Poking his head around the corner, giving that same stupid look.

“For the love of God please shut that dog up, it's 3 in the morning and I have work.” He peered down at the empty bottle of Jack beside me. “Dude you relapsed?! My God you are a mess, clean yourself up and I swear,” I hated when he pointed that finger at me, “If you have another drop of anything but water I will tell Gary about you and your mutt, I'm serious this time I will NOT stand for this shit anymore!” Buddy was back to his resting position, staring straight at me, not even noticing my roommate's outburst.

I began to chuckle once more, I couldn't help myself. “What kind of name is Gary? Who even is Gary?”

“He's our landlord my lord- okay im going to bed just please keep it down, we're gonna have to sort this shit out in the morning.” With that he left the kitchen, leaving me with the dog.

“You need to kill him, kill your roommate."

“Yea yea you've said, I wouldn't be too opposed to it I mean the guys a dick.” I joked. Getting up from the floor, I hobbled back to the tv. Plugging the wire back into its socket I got back to my fishing show. I know it sounds silly but drunk me needed that breather. Not only am I being told what to do by my roommate but I'm also being told what to do by my dog. By Buddy, by whatever is in my kitchen staring at me. 

“Kill him, do it, kill your roommate.” Buddy still didn't move from his post, he stayed watch over me as I tried to ignore him. “Kill your roommate. You must kill your roommate.” This went on for about an hour as I tried to unwind, trying to ignore him. After hearing ‘kill your roommate’ for the 52nd time, I was fed up, turning the tv off (with the remote this time) I turned to Buddy.

“Why won't you just shut up? I'll send you to the pound, don't make me do that.”

“Kill your roommate.”

“On a serious point I can't do it Buddy, why do you want him dead anyway?” 

“Kill your roommate, it will be the key to unlocking your true desires. Upoooonnnn thiiiss roooaahh ROUGH ROUGH ROUGH!”

I groaned. *God I'm sober now*, and with no money to buy another drop, I'm stuck with a howling mutt. I can't believe it, I actually have to go get some cash to pay for more liquor. I sure as shit can't take another loan from my roommate. What would I tell him? *Sorry roomie, I'll pay you back, I know I already owe you for last month's rent. I just need to talk to my dog real quick about killing you.* Work it is then, ill find a job and ill get to continue my talks with Buddy. I heard the lights flick on in my roommates room. A muffled voice shot to the kitchen.

“Will you shut that damn dog up!”

It's hard to go through withdrawal symptoms, it's even harder finding a job under withdrawal symptoms. Not only is the job market buggered right now, but with my credentials it was near impossible finding a job that was worth anything above minimum wage. Buddy was my burden, I needed to care for him but he scared the shit out of me. I was a mess walking around in public, giving a nervous glance to every dog walking down the street. Could they talk too? How about if I give my roommate liquor, could he hear dogs? Buddy became my life, I needed to uncover his secrets. 

Shit out of luck, I was standing on the corner of my block leaning on a post. Putting my hand in my pocket I felt around for anything. *A five dollar note and a 50 cent coin, great.* The block was near empty except for the odd homeless guy planted on their usual spots. Store wise there was a cafe, some second hand stores and a grocery store in between two bars. Quite the miserable sight. So I went up the street into the cafe to think of my predicament. 

Spending my last 5 dollar note, I sat down to wait for my coffee. *I heard online that if you hold your breath for 1 minute, breath for 30 seconds and repeat that process, you can achieve something similar to being wasted. I'd need to try that later-*

“Excuse me, sir?” Pulled out of my thoughts, I looked up to see a waitress hand me my coffee. 

“Oh thanks. Hey, I was wondering if I could get a job here, do you need any work done around the place?”

She gave a flat faced look, a strand of her hair escaped her bun, lying on her apathetic frown. I immediately knew I wasn't getting the job.

I got up and began to walk out of the place, “It's alright dont worry about it nevermind.”

“Wait sir, we're not hiring right now. I'm sorry, but my friend might have a job for you.”

Turning around I returned to her, I was startled by my own pace. “ What have you got? For my expenses I need a job that is above minimum wage but not by much! I'll do anything.”

She was visibly taken back by my outburst.

“Sir… Do you like dogs?”

I rubbed my face, wiping my disappointment off in a clean swipe, “I can deal with dogs, I'm actually taking care of one now.” I sighed reluctantly.

“Well my friend runs a pound a couple blocks over, If you want I can get his number for you? Put in a good word?” She then bent over, scribbling the name, address and number of the place onto a napkin before handing it to me.

“You're a lifesaver, thank you so much.”

I left that store a different man. The sun was brighter, the humidity was warmer and people were smiling. What a day. I didn't even care that I had to walk an hour a day to my new potential job. Even though I had to deal with more dogs, I came up around to the dog issue. Potential experiments were endless.

Making my way there was quite the mission. Not a wonder in the world why I miss this shop everytime I pass by here. My local pound was placed in between two long brick buildings, it looked like the letter H. It opened up slightly when you walked into the glorified alleyway, a rusty gate to the left with a dilapidated building in the middle. At the top of the building lay a deflated inflatable weiner dog, its head flopped over the front roof, a strangled neck, barely keeping the head from falling off.

Swinging the door open came the sound of a ring and a choir of barking dogs. A symphony of muffled barks and howls echoed around the waiting room and the front desk. The sound was emanating from behind the desk in a long corridor, sealed by a wooden door. Behind the front desk sat a large man with a rotund frame.

“Hi, do you work here?”

The man folded his arms, they looked like tree trunks. “Work here? I own this place, how can I help you?”

“I was looking for a job sir.”

“A job? What's your credentials?”

“Dropped out of highschool, I worked at a corporate building for a while, I was the paperboy.” His brow stayed in a stern manner, clearly unimpressed. “I like dogs, I have a dog.” An uncomfortable silence followed this. The Man still had his arms folded, I could see a small patch of mustard in his moustache.

“Well son, are you fine with cleaning up dog shit? Are you fine with putting dogs down? What about handling potentially dangerous animals, with rabies and all of that.”

“Sir please, I'm desperate, I'll do anything.” 

“Show me any form of registration.”

I handed him my old highschool ID from a few years prior, I didn't have a drivers license just yet so that ID was all I really had at the time.

“You're hired, we can do the paperwork later.”

“Great! When can I start?”

“Right now son, I need an extra pair of hands today” He got up grabbing a key from his key ring to the holding room.

“Got some mess you need to clean.”

I had no clue what they fed those dogs and I did not want to find out. The shift was long and tedious but pay was pay. I hated my apartment door late at night, the loud whining and squealing of the hinges would always wake up half the building. Before I could close the door, my roommate stormed out of his room and gave me his classic friendly welcome home.

“Let me smell your breath.”

“No I'm not doing any of that shit anymore I promise.” Buddy was no longer in his usual spot under the fridge, I had no clue where he was.

“Well then why have you been out so long huh? I care about you man, you can't be treating your body this way.”

“I told you I wasn't doing anything of that kind.” I closed the door behind me, “I got a job.”

“A job?” He looked like he was looking for the definition before returning to me in a friendly gaze. “Oh man, that's actually really cool. I'm sorry, where's your work?” 

“At the pound, let me tell you it's not a pretty job.”

“Work is work man, hey maybe next time you go there you can take Buddy with you, he's been weird as shit recently.”

“Besides constantly avoiding you?”

“No no I've gotten used to that,” he wiped his jaw downwards, “yea no its weird ill just show you.”

My roommate led me into my bedroom where Buddy was. He was seated up right a few feet away from my small bookshelf. 

“Yea he's been doing that ever since you left, he hasn't even eaten anything. His eyes have just been darting up and down each book. It's weird.”

“Buddy?” I walked up to the dog's large frame, he was so still. “You alright Buddy?” Peering closer I realised that the dog was dead still, he lacked the animation of breathing. Just a slight turn of his head and eyes peering at each book was the slightest clue to tell us that he wasn't a statue. He looked like a puppet. Shaking the dog did nothing, he was stationary. His folds rippled at the shake of my hands and yet I couldn't move his large frame. I grabbed a blanket from my bed and flung it over the shelf. Buddy immediately stood on his fours and walked out of the room, nudging my roommate out of the way causing him to stumble. Following him out of the room, we saw him seated at the base of the kitchen, staring up into the top shelf. This time he was looking at an edmonds cookbook.

“Okay Buddy, it's late, time for bed.” I said, nervously shifting the book to the back of the shelf. Buddy made many rounds around the apartment after that, analysing each room he went into. Meanwhile, my roommate and I would attempt to hide every book Buddy laid eyes upon. Finally, when there were no books in sight, the dog went to rest. There was no more stomping, no scrambling around the place, nothing. I walked back into my room to rest (I had a big shift the next day). When I took a look at the bookshelf, I was surprised to find that I must've missed the bottom shelf as there was a solitary book sitting in the corner. I'm surprised it was there in the first place as I hadn't seen it in months. There it was, standing upright with an imprint of a golden colour. Completely observable to the naked eye was a King James Bible.
