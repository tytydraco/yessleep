I come bearing great news!

*Incredible* news!

A gift that one could only dream of…

A family of love that you've never known before is coming to you, right to your door.

In the dead of night they'll march, their bare feet stomping through mud and dirt, through bramble and thorns, through sticks and stones until they find you and set you free. It is their devotion. It is their love. The love of the Horse god.

He came for me at midnight—they all did. I heard the drums before I heard his mighty hooves crunching down the old dirt road. A sharp rhythmic thumping that cracked the frozen night air to grace my sleeping ears. Its beat matched my heart as I shot up in sweat and fear.

*Th-th-thump! Th-th-thump!*

My wife stirred beside me, and in her I sensed fear too. Such an inorganic sound in a place so far on the outskirts of civilization…

She asked what it was, but I had no answer for her, so together we listened a moment longer.

*Th-th-thump! Th-th-thump!*

They continued through the night, unceasing and never faltering in their ethereal tempo. A horse’s gallop, I remember thinking. They sounded like a horse’s gallop.

A gallop that was drawing closer.

I was still scared at this point, my eyes not yet opened to the truth, so I jumped from my bed and moved out into the hall, the music of the night scoring my steps as I crept down moonlit corridors. I made it to the front window of my home and peered into the abyss, horrified by what I saw.

Marching down the old dirt road in the moon's cursed milk-light, their heads and bodies barely peeked above the brittle wheat fields; a procession of pale figures approached, their forms moving grotesquely to the beat of the drums they pounded. They jerked and writhed in unnatural ways, halfway between a seizure and something graceful, like a bounding deer.

A dance. An ancient parade that, in that moment, I could scarcely understand.

They were all nude, lathered in mud with sticks tangled in their hair. From the dull light, I could see little of their flesh otherwise, but in their bare condition, I imagined rotted cuts and infected bruises all over their hands and feet. Their faces were the worst, however, a sight that I could spy even through the darkness and the fear blurring my vision.

At first I thought they were hybrids; some sick blend of man and animal, but that wasn’t the case. They only wore skins. Hastily scraped pelts tugged taut over their visages, some torn crudely so that I could still make out the human beneath, others so perfectly preserved that it almost seemed a part of them.

Several—between their dances—crawled on all fours or bounded along like a wounded hare. Combined with the primal, chilling hammering of the drums, it gave them a wildness that was inhuman. Otherworldly. They seemed to almost shift beneath their animal cloaks, becoming the beasts they were mocking for moments at a time as they howled and cackled with delight.

*Th-th-thump! Th-th-thump!*

Still, they were human. Beneath it all, I knew they were nothing more than flesh and bone like me.

I could not say the same for the being in the middle of the pack.

It towered over the others, and instead of being animalistic in form, it simply *was* an animal. A horse. It steadily trotted along with its dancers, an elegant stillness to it compared to the others. Its head did not stray from a determined gaze forward. Its body did not jerk or jostle as would match the ocean of bodies around it. It simply marched on with grave purpose and strength—the sun that all the humans gravitated around.

This did not mean it was normal, however. A horse's body it may have had, but it was far from the simple-minded creature of this earth. Even from so far away and only by its dark silhouette did I feel it. A numbing, washing dread that shivered through me as I stood paralyzed in that window.

Its body was equine, but its movement was not.

The creature marched with a gait that was not horse nor human. It’d lift a leg high at a perfect square angle, then snap it out straight ahead, parallel to the ground. After that, it fell back to the earth, lugging its body forward as its opposite limbs followed suit.

It was uncanny. Nightmarish; like a vision you would only see through the lens of a dream. It was hardly anything compared to what I could see from its head, however.

I could barely make out a swollen skull, long like a horse, but not narrow. It jutted out like a man’s; three times the size of a normal one. Instead of the long run of a snout from forehead to lips that a steed would usually have, its own nose bumped off its brow, then ran long down its face before jutting up at its tip like the fin of a shark. Beneath it, its lips flapped and whinnied, the corners of the mouth stretched all the way to its jawbones.

Teeth glistened in the moonlight. Teeth that were human but ran the entire long jaw like an alligator’s. Along with them, an eye the size of a tea saucer caught my glare from its side profile.

I could sense it was looking straight at me.

The procession marched down the road, and finally breaking from my trance, I ducked low, peeking above the sill and trembling. Though normally it would be impossible for anyone so far out and in such darkness to have spotted me behind the glass, I sensed that the writhing parade had no need for such literal sight.

They had already seen me in other ways.

*Th-th-thump! Th-th-thump!*

I prayed that they’d pass by as they continued down the street. That the group was simply a mad cult-like compound in the woods carrying out some nightly ritual in my area, and not an otherworldly abomination come to destroy us. All of this was just an occurrence I happened to witness, but no real harm would come to me or my family.

That prayer was unanswered as the dancers came to a halt before my sprawling driveway, the drums thrumming to an abrupt end along with them. The horse towering above them continued its haunting march until it too had reached my homestead, then, like a soldier moving at attention, it pivoted sharply, both of its eyes now fixed squarely at my shelter.

Large, piercing eyes on the front of its face.

Predator eyes.

I had no need to see more. I turned back into the safety of my home and ran down the hall, moving for the bedrooms. My wife waited there, clutching the side of the hallway, a look of raw terror and confusion plaguing her face. She opened her mouth to ask me what was wrong, but I spoke before she could.

“Wake the children.” I barked, my words rickety atop the supports of my shuddering breath. “We need to leave. Now.”

I saw by the watery glisten in her eyes, she wanted more information, but my speed told her there was no time. My fear only compounded her panic, and though I hated to see her fret, urgency was more important.

As she opened the doors to my sons’ rooms and rattled them awake, I charged back to my bed. My heart pressed heavy against my ribs as I knelt and reached for the box hidden beneath; a gun safe with a pistol that I’d kept for ruffian burglars or feral animals that might pose a threat to my family out in the sticks.

In a sense, I supposed that the latter was the case now, but I had grossly underestimated our local fauna.

Within was also a flashlight, of which I snatched up too. Past the doorway as I stood, I could see my wife rallying the children in the hall. The poor boys wiped sleep from their eyes and glared at the dark air around them, as if trying to see the waves of sound from the drums that were falling on their ears.

Growing louder. Ever closer…

*Th-th-thump! Th-th-thump*!

Now behind it, there was a new sound that joined in. A sharp, mighty one that even overpowered the hoots and hollers from feral men and women mimicking the cries of wild beasts.

Horse's hooves on the dirt driveway. Rhythmic and steady.

*Clip-Clop! Clip-Clop!*

 Slowly, my sons’ fatigue turned to fear, and my heart ached more beneath the panic.

In a hurry, I reached for my beloved and beckoned them all closer, turning for the window of my room and moving to slide it open. The woods behind my home was the last place a man would want to lead his family in the dark of night, but with our front besieged, there was no other option.

My wife screamed, however, as I began to slide the glass away. Something she’d seen there that I had missed on my scramble for the window’s latch. Pale figures weaving from between the trees. More muck-riddled followers of the creature in my driveway, creeping and prowling out on all fours like beasts about to pounce.

With dread, I unleashed the beam in my hand, casting its light through the window and scraping the trees to see just how many wicked horrors crept there.

My tongue felt thick in my throat when I saw four already skulking onto the lawn, perfectly spaced apart to cover any gap of escape. A feverish nausea overtook me as the light cast across their pelt-covered visages, only to reveal their eyes glowing in their sunken sockets. Catching and reflecting the beam like a coyote might beneath headlights.

There were even more that I could see glinting in the trees behind, their bodies still obscured in shadow.

“To the kitchen,” I commanded. “Move!”

There was no more option of escape at that moment. I was a fine shot, but with my hands so shaky and from such great distance, I didn’t trust myself to put the lurkers down reliably. After all, I only had so many bullets—far less than the numbers of the twisted procession. Funneling them to the back door, then culling out an escape was my only bet.

We moved as one, hands like iron chains gripped into one another. Each foot of our small abode felt like a mile we had to move as the drums and hooves outside ticked down like a clock.

*Th-th-thump… Th-th-thump*…

*Clip-Clop… Clip-Clop…*

We rounded the hallway into our entry, ready to turn into the kitchen when it happened. A heavy force seemed to set upon my shoulders, and when I blinked, I was no longer shivering in the dark of my home.

I was in a field, vast and brilliant; golden grass swaying beneath a gentle breeze, casting waves over its surface like an ocean. Beyond the steppe, far into the distance, large bronze canyons towered, like natural castles reigning over such sacred lands. The sky was blue and clear—not a cloud in sight—and the sun blazed like a hot summer. The heat rippled my vision and past the gentle warmth it offered, I felt it burning at my flesh.

I turned, no longer seeing my family with me. I was alone, save for a figure standing only a stone’s throw away.

It was a steed—a black stallion—its shiny coat glistening with sweat beneath the sweltering sun. Its hind was turned toward me, tail flicking away flies that pestered and persisted around its skin. Several flies.

Too many flies…

They buzzed through the air relentlessly, their humming the only sound I could hear other than the breeze and the horses eating. Its neck was dipped below the grass, buried in the plants as it munched away. The sound wasn’t that of grain being plucked and then ground between teeth, however—it was wet. It was squelching. It tore with a gurgle rather than a crackle.

I knew I should have felt fear, but somehow, I didn’t. I felt a calm tranquility washing over me in waves as I stood motionless in that field, watching the horse eat below the grass. In the distance, I swore I could hear something ringing over the mountaintops; glass shattering or a faint scream, but they morphed into rolling thunder and a bird's call in my mind.

In front of me, something began rising from the wheat around the horse. Human arms, as if figures were crouching beneath the grass and raising their hands in reverence. But just when they were fully stretched out, they continued, sprouting like cornstalks until their tips were leveled high above the stallion's back.

Then, they all curled in. Slowly and gently, they bended at their elongated elbows and rested on the horse's back, petting its hide with a graceful motion. The dozens of limbs cascaded over each other like crashing waves, and though the horse didn’t seem to notice at first, eventually, its chewing stopped, and it began to raise its neck.

Through the tangle of arms, there was little I could spot, but I grasped that it didn’t have the standard mane of a horse. Its hair cascaded only from its scalp, yet it was long enough to billow down to its shoulders. The locks were wild and ratty, the tips of the places near the head clumped and dripping with some sort of liquid.

More flies hummed around them. So many flies.

Then, it began to turn. Its serpentine neck curled back on itself to face me, and when the locks fell away, I could see red through the gaps in the limbs. A pale, blood-soaked face with flesh bits hanging from its lips.

A face that looked disturbingly like mine.

Then, I was back in my home. I blinked, and the world was dark again, save for the light I had aimed at our back door. My wife’s screams filled my ears, and the drums were right outside now.

*Th-th-thump! Th-th-thump*!

A figure stood right at the glass, their filthy paw on the handle—I’d faltered too long. I raised my weapon in panic, firing a shot at the beast and shattering the glass. Screams from my family burst in my ringing ears as the man crumpled to the ground.

I’d struck him square in the chest, blood leaking through the filth covering him and washing it clean. A pool of the crimson began to form on the platform outside, but there was no cause to celebrate.

A new vagrant immediately behind the first came rushing on all fours, a coyote pelt loosely streaming off her back. I unleashed another shattering blast in her direction, striking her shoulder and pummeling her into a limp. She made no sound like the tearing metal didn’t phase her, however, and she simply continued her charge.

A second shot nailing her head finally put a rest to her travel, her skull shattering like pottery beneath the pelt covering it. She slipped and skidded in her own blood till her head bumped my foot.

My gaze snapped back to the egress only to find more glowing orbs hovering in the beacon of my light. I was ready to take aim, but the wails behind me increased in their pitch suddenly, and I felt my arm yanked back.

The importance of my family turned my eyes from the threat only to find that our chain was compromised. Opposite our link, a man with two raccoon pelts pulled hastily over either side of his face was on all fours with my child’s sleeve in his mouth, tugging like a wolf fighting its comrade for a meat-covered femur.

They’d smashed the grand window in the living room and begun pouring inside, surrounding us entirely.

My son wailed in fear and his mother cried in protest; meanwhile, I turned to level my gun. It was too late, however. In the time my back was to our previous assailants, they’d trudged in, and I was taken to the ground to bathe among the red puddle I’d made of the coyote woman.

What happened next was a blur. Stampedes of bare feet and calloused hands thundered through our house along with the drums outside, which by now had crescendoed into a rapid heartbeat. Men and women lost to madness gripped my clan by whatever they could and began dragging us out the same way they’d entered. I felt shattered glass lacerate my back as we were yanked through the window, but I could barely cry out over the chaos and noise.

Or perhaps I did, and it got lost in the stomach-churning concoction of my family's wails and the howls of onlookers.

The cool autumn air teased my hot skin as we were carried across the porch and into the driveway, closer to the drums. Closer to the crowd that waited there, and closer to the moonlit abomination standing tall over it all.

*THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP—*

We were tossed rudely at its hooves, and all at once, the sound ceased. Drums stopped, the animalistic cries died down, and soon, even the screams and whimpers of my own family were hushed out by demand of the sinister silence. I looked around in dread at the procession, all of whom were standing still and watching us intently now. All except their god, who’s neck stooped down to inspect us.

I felt power the closer its face came to ours. I felt fear. Not the kind of fear that’s often felt by our kind—the one that comes with unknown bumps in the night or the occasion mistaken silhouette in the dark.

This was primal fear. An ancient understanding lost somewhere along the line of our species. One demanding respect for forces we can’t possibly fathom.

I knelt away from it, my head bowing to the ground as tears streamed my face. I watched them wet the stone beneath my knees as I saw my family do the same in my periphery.

*Thwack—Thwump!*

Two meaty impacts to my side caused us to jolt, and my wife to release a squeak of shock. I turned as subtly as I could to see what had just been laid out, as to not upset the judge carefully turning me over with his all-seeing eyes.

It was two corpses—the very ones that I had just put down. The first man had been passed face up, the bleeding hole in his chest creating a new fountain of blood to join my tears in the dirt. On his right, the woman, her mangled head peeking out from her pelt which had begun slipping off her head.

I startled again when the being before let out a snort. A sour huff of air through its nose that dusted my face and sent a chill through me. I felt dread for a moment that I’d angered it, but then it turned from me and took a step to the corpses.

Still in my peripheral, too afraid to let my eyes meet it head on, I watched the king kneel its head to the man. Its nose drew close to the hole I’d punched through his ribs, then he began to sniff at it. A few moments passed, then its long, alligator mouth opened.

A tongue unfurled from deep in its throat, and the wormlike appendage touched to the skin. It began to lap and work over it, digging inside and cleaning the outside. Nobody stirred or made a sound throughout the entire process; nobody except for me, who still shivered and wept at the might of the being only an arms-length away.

Finally, after what seemed an eternity, the horse god raised its head, and pulled away.

The body lay motionless for a spell, as if nothing had changed, but then, I heard movement. Its fingers scraped at the gravel, then its arms began to twitch, and soon, guttural, frothing noises bubbled from his throat.

All at once, he erupted with motion. His body seized and spasmed, rolling over and pushing off the ground onto his fours. His limbs continued to tremble and shake, and his head shook violently ‘no’ as he rubbed a cheek to his shoulder, as if trying to scratch and itch deep in his skull.

The Horse God released another snort, and the once-dead man attempted to move off into the crowd with the same stunted movement. It was like his body remembered what it was once like to be alive, but his brain no longer had the ability to remind it properly. He disappeared from my vision, and the Horse God moved on.

The process repeated with the woman. The leader of the misfit clan brushed aside her pelt with its human-like snout, then sniffed around at the split skull. I expected it to take the same cautious amount of time assessing the damage before unleashing its tongue again, but that’s not what happened.

The horse released a whinnie so shrill and harsh that one could mistake it for a human scream of anger. Its mighty hoof stomped the ground, then dragged a line before the beast turned its body away, moving back over to us.

As it left, I saw several people break the circle, scampering over to the woman’s body and descending on it like vultures. They grabbed at her limbs with their teeth, dragging her away as they tried to pull loose strips of flesh. My stomach churned as I saw one woman in a mountain lion shawl bury her face into the dead body's head—the spot where I’d blown access into her brain.  

I averted my gaze to the ground once more after that.

Then we were the main focus once more. Me and my beautiful family. I could still hear their heart-aching sobs next to me as they, too, tried not to meet the gaze of our host. I wanted to fight back. I wanted to stand and oppose the beast before me, but I couldn’t. The gun had been wrenched from my hand as we were taken; we were horribly outnumbered, and I knew that before a being that could breathe life back into the dead, I was nothing but an ant upon the gravel I was bleeding on.

So I just sat there. Sat and hoped with all my might that whatever fate the fallen deity had in store for us, it contained mercy.

I had been so afraid at that time. So scared after what I’d seen it decide for that dead woman that it simply wasn’t in the cards. I was wrong, though.

The Horse God had come to bring me mercy. It had come to bring love.

Its head stooped low, starting at my youngest boy, so far away from me. Like it had with the bodies, it began to sniff. Long, tentative drags of cold night air that came back out in faint white ghosts. It snorted and huffed for one minute, then two, my heartbeat keeping time for me as it beat rapid in my chest. Then, without any action, it moved on to the next of my kin.

The same practice. The surrounding air was analyzed; all the scents and auras that he might be emitting. His tiny face cowered away from the mighty steed, but then, just like with my first, he moved on.

My wife went next, and her process was the same. The god danced near her, but not even a brush or scrape was laid onto her by the steed or his followers. For a brief moment as I trembled in the cold, I allowed myself to believe we were safe. It was foolish, I know, but nothing about this occurrence so far had ended in harm except for the accidental thrashing I’d received when being torn through the window.

That hope changed when the Horse god reached me.

His snout jutted for me, and I bowed lower to the ground to hide my face, the sweat on my brow sticking gravel dust to my forehead. I stared at the soil, but my eyes clamped tightly shut when the being immediately differed in its rhythm. It took two inhales in, then one sharp one, and paused.

It smelled something on me. Something *within me.*

Something that had earned its interest, and to a creature like this, it was something that I didn’t wish to have.

It moved its mouth so close that I could feel its breath on my neck as it took in my scent, hot and reeking of death, like fresh roadkill. A wet crackle teased my ears as I heard its mouth begin to part, then like before—still covered in blood—its tongue unfurled, lingering near to my face and dragging over my cheek.

If I had known at the time how much of a blessing this was, I wouldn’t have dared to wretch with fear and disgust. The Horse God backed away from me as my heart pounded heavy, knowing that my moment of judgement must have been at hand. I watched its hooves as he stood firm before me, still as a oak.

Then, I watched it raise a hoof, stomp it down, and drag a line through the dirt.

Once… twice… three times.

I shut my eyes again and released a whimper, prepared to face the same fate as the corpse of the same verdict moments ago.

What happened was not that, however. I heard hollers and howls like before, yes, but the steps did not come for me.

I heard my family scream out as animal hordes descended on them.

Horrible, *vile* screams—screams that would make one weep even if they weren’t the tortured wails of ones you loved. I was too shocked to breathe, and my head began to turn slowly in utter denial. My peripheral barely met the bottom half of my wife as she was pinned over beside me, a body holding her down while her legs thrashed and kicked against the driveway.

Before her choked gurgles could rend my heart from my chest, I saw a large, pale cheek block my view, a split of perfect human teeth running along it like a path, and a nose twisting off the muzzle. Presiding over all, however, was the small sliver I caught of an eye the size of a tea saucer; bloodshot and human up until its needle-thin pupil.

The Horse God nuzzled my sight away from the scene and guided me back to the ground, and then, its lips parted. From deep within its throat, I heard rumbles and hisses. I think I soiled myself from fear, unsure of what my own fate was to be, but then, I realized what the sounds were. My shivering stopped, the air stood still, and the scream and cackles around me went silent.

Ancient whispers began to seep into my mind. Secrets from the being that a mere man like me could not possibly have imagined. Truths long lost to time, so world-shattering and life-changing that any suffering or fear I felt in that instance fizzled to dust.

The Horse God raised a hoof and let it hover, then my vision switched in a flash. I was back in the field of golden wheat, the whole sky now a bright blood red beneath a setting sun. The horse that was me stood within a tall arch of hands—pale arms like corn stalks wrapped and bound together like knotted ivy.

More rose from around me, but all slithered toward their joint brothers before finding a place they belonged. They wriggled themselves into a position among the organic passage, while meanwhile on the horizon, the canyons had changed.

Now, I saw upon the plateau’s cities of all kinds; ancient Greek temples and Roman coliseums. There were towns of wood and straw contrasting cities of brick and mortar towering high toward the heavens. No matter how gargantuan or mighty the structures might be, they all were painted with the same fate.

Flame and fire. Ruin and death. Each one crumbled from the cliffs and fell back into the mountains they’d been erected from, leaving nothing behind but a pillar of dust and ash.

The horse standing within the arch and wearing my face smiled at me, then stood. It lifted its entire front half from the ground in a way I’d never seen an equine do, then its arms spread wide in offering, the hooves at its limb’s ends no longer hooves. They were normal human hands, the fingers spread and bent like tree branches as they sprouted lush green leaves.

The breeze that had filled the plains earlier was now a harsh, rushing wind; a storm that carried with it the whispers of the Horse God still seeping into my ears. I let the words wash over me, wringing each piece of ancient knowledge that I could in an attempt to even slightly comprehend the might standing before me. I had felt peace here before, but now, it was pure euphoria as my whole perception was changed, and I fell to my knees and wept.

I understood it now. In one small instance, I knew why the old god and his procession had come. It was out of love. It was out of necessity. It was to offer a chance to those who are worthy, that they might live the way that we are supposed to. The way we forgot.

Kingdoms will rise and fall, and civilizations will come and go, but soil is forever. Earth, air and sea always remain once cities crumble to dust. There is only one true home for all life. Only one true way to live without the perils that civilization brought.

We return to it. To the unknown forests and forgotten caves that we once dwelled. To the food that was once freely offered, never bought. To the community we once found in one another through our toil for survival.

The Horse god was offering me this escape. There was no other way to return home otherwise. No path other than the Horse god.

Once this truth settled, my sight cleared, and I was back in the place I once called home, kneeling before my savior. I had been cold and shivering before, but now I felt warm and safe. The people I had once known as my family were no longer screaming, and instead, I was surrounded by a new clan; a wondrous gathering of brothers and sisters that all barked, howled, and whinnied in joy at their new brother.

I wept more, too overwhelmed by my joy for words, then threw myself around the neck of the creature that had saved me. I kissed at the mane that I had once found repulsive, but that I now knew was beautiful, because it was hope.

While I still hung to it, the Horse god lifted me to my feet, and I stood. I looked to the road that the procession had arrived from, and elation brewed in my gut, knowing that soon I would walk the same path.

There were other matters first that I sensed as my new lord lifted its head tall. It spoke so many words without uttering a sound, and I nodded in understanding, turning back to my house one more time.

Stepping over the mangled piles of unworthy meat that soaked my feet red, I returned to the building behind us as my new brothers and sisters bent strips of wood and branches, then tied them off with woven grasses. Over the circlets, they stretched fresh, bloody skins to fashion new drums; instruments that I couldn’t wait to play when our parade set out once more.

In the meantime, I shed my clothes, the itch they caused growing more uncomfortable by the moment. I would not need them anymore—not when I would have a pelt of my own so very soon.

I clambered back over the sill into the place I once called home, but now its pleasant, familiar smells hung rancid to my nostrils, and seemed unnatural to what the air was supposed to be. I fought through the discomfort and went to the blasted machine resting on the desk in the corner.

A computer; the last time I would use one.

That is where I sit now, and why I write this message to you.

Soon, I will depart. In the dead of the night I'll march, my bare feet stomping through mud and dirt, through bramble and thorns, through sticks and stones until we find you and set you free. It is our devotion. It is our love.

The love of the Horse god.

I have been allowed to share all of this with you. To tell you the great news.

That soon, you will be set free! Worthy or unworthy, we shall all return to where we belong. Either to dust, or to the wild that we crawled out from, we shall find a true home once again.

It may not be tonight, or the night after that, or even before the seasons change from fall to winter, or winter to spring—but rest assured, someday, you’ll hear the drums, and you will know to rejoice.

The Horse god’s procession comes at midnight, and soon, we will be [coming for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/InkWielder/comments/1ojp4xa/story_library/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
