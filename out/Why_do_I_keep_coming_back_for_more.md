I pushed past discomfort thirty minutes into our session. Now it just hurt but I endured my trembling legs, my exploding heart.

*Look at yourself.*

Two more burpees.

*I said, look at yourself*

Our sessions were held privately in the studio. I obeyed him and faced my reflection.

*You’re doing it all wrong. Look!*

He showed me how to do it. Did it all in one perfect movement.

*Nowadays we can’t say anything but you know what you are.*

I looked away. Moo. He didn’t say it but I saw him mouthing the word in the mirror. He knew I would never actually look away so he winked at me through the reflection.

I wanted to rip his lips from his face. Maybe then he’d never smile again. I moved in slow motion, too tired to finish the rep, unable to stop either. My lungs burned, my heart felt like it would give up. I kind of wished it would.

*You’re leaking again.*

That sing-song voice. I wanted someone would rip his vocal chords from his throat with their bare hands.

*Should a lactating \*I won’t say what\* go to the gym?*

I stared at myself. Thighs twice the size they used to be, smooth skin now covered in bumpy cellulite.

*Honestly, I think you’re a health hazard coming in like this.*

I could smell my milk oozing out of my nipples, through the breast pads, through the sports bra.

*At least you know your kid won’t die of hunger.*

I tried to jump but my body was cemented to the floor.

*Don’t stop, don’t stop.*

He clapped his hands in front of my face. I was thankful for the small breeze the movement created.

*One more rep, then get the boxing gloves.*

The rep I finished WAS the last one. He said it was the last one two minutes before.

*Come on. We’ve been doing the same routine for three months now. I hope your kid got the dad’s brains.*

I began again but he barely looked at me, eyes glued to his phone, laughing at some dumb reel. I could barely raise my arms above my head. I crashed to the floor and threw my legs back. I felt pain down there, where It tore me when It came out.

*You’re wasting my time. And yours.*

He paced, looking at his watch. I wanted to bash his head into the floor. My eyes were wet with tears and the continuous flow of sweat running down my forehead.

*Let’s go, let’s go.*

I tried sliding on my boxing gloves quickly but the action felt like slow motion. The gloves smelled like a dead animal but that didn’t matter, I just needed to get through this. I wanted to beat him and make him cry, instead the opposite always happened.

*You’re literally doing none of the things I showed you. Arms up, swing with your hips. Protect your face.*

He jabbed me in the face. Not hard, but enough to show me I never would learn. My lip stung but the skin was intact. My fat red face felt hotter on the right cheek now.

*Keep moving those feet.*

I was moving them. I tried swinging but my arms were too weak from the hour of HIIT I’d powered through already.

*I’m gonna film you again*.

He laughed. He had filmed me secretly once then posted the videos online under a fake account. I found out when he showed me the comments. People mocking my torture. I wanted to do the same to him but he was everyone’s poster boy.

*Time’s up soggy bacon.*

I pulled the boxing gloves from my hands and threw them at his little pin head. It was a failed, pathetic attempt to regain some form of dignity, but the gloves barely crossed the room. And he didn’t even notice.

I picked the gloves up from the floor and put them in my bag, my body too dehydrated to cry or sweat now. In the changing room, my body slumped. My mind was numb and my muscles trembled. I sat there for some time staring at his smile on the picture: “Suicide and Crisis Support. If you or someone you know is struggling, we’re here to help.”
