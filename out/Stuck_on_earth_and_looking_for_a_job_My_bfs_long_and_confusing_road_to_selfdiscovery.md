After Elijah Carter and I returned from our trip to the catacombs, we went our separate ways for the day. We made our report to Mary Markov, of course, but we both just wanted to rest up. I felt like I had come dangerously close to losing my mind down in that shaft. The newsreader wasn’t done with me, though. She offered to drive me home in Eli’s stead, saying that she had something to discuss with me. I agreed and got into her truck. She told me that she was planning on sending some of her staff further into the tunnels to explore, now that we had ensured there was probably little to no immediate danger in doing so. 

She expressed her gratitude for our cooperation, to which I informed her I’d prefer it if she expressed it in money. We drove by a bank where she transferred a significant sum to my account as well as Elijah’s. That lifted my mood in the best way, and I felt far more relaxed as we continued on our drive. Mary’s demeanor however had changed. “Take a look into the glove compartment, please.”

I complied, opening it to find a small cardboard box sitting inside. I carefully wrapped my fingers around it and took it out, inspecting it warily.

“Think of it as a gift.”

Whatever it was, it was quite heavy. I began to open it, only for the newsreader to stop me with a raise of her hand. “Wait with that until you’re home, please.”

“Well, what is it?” I raised a skeptical brow. 

“It’s… an item I would like for you to look at. See what you can make of it, okay?”

“I don’t get it. Is it dangerous?”

“Probably not. Nothing you can’t handle, I’m sure.”

“So me exploring a murder cult’s lair wasn’t enough for one day?” I asked.

Mary Markov sighed. “Look, this is important for you, too. I have a suspicion… relating to Frank Preston and the item in that box. I believe you’ll be able to draw conclusions from this object that we can’t. If so, please let me know.”

I reminded her of the more pressing issues we were facing at the moment—the Collective, the impending apocalypse, etcetera. She, however, insisted that if she was correct in her assumption (which she still wouldn’t disclose), it could work to our advantage. I finally conceded, taking the little box home with me. I didn’t immediately unwrap it, though, instead leaving it on my nightstand and collapsing on the bed, deeply in need of some rest.

I had the strangest dream. It was about Frankie, and mind you, this isn’t the first time that’s happened. This one was weird, though. I couldn’t remember any of the details upon waking, but there were some images that lingered. Naked people in caves, someone whittling, with the waiter appearing in the mix at random over and over again. I woke up prematurely, startled and in a cold sweat. I didn’t go back to sleep immediately, opting instead to grab a glass of milk and open Mary Markov’s box. I just wanted to take my mind off of things.

I started tearing away at the cardboard. After a bit of a struggle, I had bared the object hidden within. It was without a doubt one of the stranger things I'd ever seen. A figurine, about the same size as my hand, carved from stone or something similarly weighty and rough. It had to have been painted at one point, tiny flecks of white and gold interrupting the natural sandy color. The rest must have peeled away over time—it looked insanely old. Practically ancient, like something from a museum.

It was hard to tell what it depicted. It seemed to be some kind of half-animal half-man thing with what looked like a bull’s head. Its lower half was covered in a long, wrap-skirt kind of thing and there was a set of folded wings on its back. It stood on a tiny pedestal with even tinier writing on the front. I had never seen letters like these before. They didn’t remotely resemble any language I knew. I couldn’t stop running my fingers over the inscription, the rough texture oddly pleasant to the touch. I prodded the little horns atop its head and stroked its slender shoulders. It was weirdly fascinating. Eventually, I set it down and rested my head back on the pillow, slowly drifting off once more.

When I woke up the next morning, the sun had already risen outside. I yawned, comfortably twisting and turning beneath my blanket only to squeak when I felt something hard and pointy. It didn’t take me long to find the source. The figurine was *in* my sweater, scraping against the skin of my stomach. I shot up, grabbed it and threw it across the room with all my might. My chest was heaving, and I stared at it with wide eyes. It had fallen into the heap of dirty clothing I keep in the right corner (because it’s the right one to keep laundry). For some reason, I wondered if I’d hurt it. *What was wrong with me?* I must have grabbed it and pulled it close in my sleep. Still rather unnerved, I rose to my feet, trying to look straight ahead as I walked out the door. 

Sitting down in my living room, I turned on my phone. I’d been planning on calling Mary Markov right away, but I found that I had three missed calls and twenty-seven texts from Frankie Preston. Normally, I only wake up to around twelve to fifteen messages from him, so I knew something was wrong. Weirdly enough, they were all asking whether he could come over, as in, very urgently. I shot him a quick response telling him sure, and barely half an hour later, he was at my doorstep. 

“Hi, you look amazing and we can do something together later if you want.” He exhaled the words as one, bouncing on the balls of his feet. 

“Is everything alright?” I inquired, taking a step back. 

“That’s kinda what I came to ask you. I can feel something, it’s like an… an *instinct*. I need it, and it’s close.”

“What do you mean?”

He hummed, stepping around me and into my bedroom. “Oh Sunshine, my Sunshine. I’m going to have to clean up in here.” Throwing me a sheepish glance over his shoulder, he added, “If that’s okay.” 

“Frankie, what are you doing?”

“Where is it?” He grabbed a corner of my blanket and tossed it to the side. “I can feel it’s close.”

“What do you mean?”

His head swiveled around and his gaze landed on the figurine. His eyes lit up. He lunged for it, throwing himself at the heap of laundry and wrapping his hands around it the way a drowning man would grasp at a lifebuoy. His fingers clamped around the stone, stroking the tiny statue. He raised it into the light, the widest, brightest grin on his face. “Where in the world did you get this?” he breathed. 

“Mary Markov gave it to me. It’s not mine. You should stay away from it.”

“I can’t. I won’t.”

“Frank, you’re—being very strange.”

“Am I scaring you? I’m sorry. I don’t want that.” He straightened up, rearranging his attractive features into a pleasant smile. “We’re good, right?”

“Give that back,” I told him, extending my hand. 

“Sunshine, this is *mine*. I don’t want to be rude, but I do need this.”

“How can it be yours?”

“I don’t know. But it is. I forgot it was mine, but I got this feeling last night that you had it, and I need, need, *need* it. I’m so glad.” His eyes turned soft. “Answer to all my questions,” he muttered, reaching out as if to hug me, but I pulled away.

This simply wasn’t normal. The thought of refusing him was highly disagreeable, especially due to how adorable he looked, but I couldn’t ignore the unease he was giving me. “Frank, what’s going on? What is this thing?”

He looked down at the figurine like he wasn’t sure either. “Someone made this for me a very long time ago. Before I was me. For so long now, I’ve been feeling like I was forgetting something. And now it's not as far away anymore. I feel like it’s this memory just… bubbling up. It’s close.” He shook his head in disbelief. “I’m so happy.”

The feeling of wrongness was practically overwhelming me. I held out my hand once more. “Frank. Please.”

“No! Eva, don’t turn this into a fight, I’m begging you! I swear, this does belong to me. See the writing?” He held up the pedestal. “It has my name on it.” As soon as those words had left his lips, he faltered, his expression wavering. “That’s my name on there,” he repeated quietly. 

Cold dread seeped into my bones, my stomach turning as the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I had no idea what was happening anymore, all I knew was that things were spinning out of control and I didn’t want to see where they were going. “What is your name, then?” I whispered through the lump in my throat. 

“It’s been so long…”

All the warmth had disappeared from the room. I only realized this because of the gooseflesh forming on my skin, feeling the sudden sting of the cold. I whipped my head up when the ceiling light flickered to life above me. My jaw dropped as I watched it grow brighter and brighter, shining stronger than what should have been possible before burning out with an angry buzz. “Frank, what’s going on?” I shouted, trying to slow my quickening, shallow breaths. 

“Don’t worry, everything’s fine!” His smirk had grown so wide it didn’t look real anymore. The waiter looked completely unhinged. I couldn’t help but wonder what Nettie and Kit would say, seeing him like this when his normal looks had been enough to unnerve them. I jumped when I felt the floor beneath my feet starting to vibrate and wobble. I glanced around frantically and my stomach dropped. My room was *warping* before my own eyes, like a screen being tugged on while a movie was projected onto it. I couldn’t tell if it was merely my perception being influenced or if the space was truly moving. It was as if the walls were breathing—they constricted, then bulged outward in quick succession.

“Stop!” I bellowed. Purely on instinct, my tentacles had unfurled from behind my back, and I frantically pulled on my top to make room for them. Clammy sweat laced my palms as I tossed the sweater aside. *I didn’t want to do this. Not to him.* There was no other way, though. Whatever was going on, I couldn’t take it anymore. “Frankie…” I pleaded with him one last time. 

Fran finally lifted his head to look up at me. The grin disappeared from his face and his eyes grew wide. Within an instant, the walls stopped pulsing, and some of the warmth seemed to trickle back into our surroundings. “Oh God,” he muttered. “Sunshine, I’m so sorry…”

I didn’t move a single inch. My gaze remained fixed on him and I flinched when he lifted his arm, his hand clutching the figurine. I looked on in shock as his fingers clamped around it tighter and tighter until cracks began to form in the stone. Then, with one powerful squeeze, he crushed it. The remains crumbled to the floor as a tiny cloud of dust lingered around his fist. He wheedled it away. “Look, look, it’s all gone.”

I couldn’t produce a single sound.

“Evangeline Shirley,” he said, looking me over as though he was seeing me for the first time. 

“What just happened?” I choked out.

“I remembered myself. I didn’t mean to scare you. I wouldn’t hurt you; I’d rather eat shit than hurt you, okay? I know I got a bit intense there; I totally lost control.” 

“Would you please just explain?” I reached up to massage my temples, sinking down on my bed. “You said something about your name being on there. Does it really say Frank?”

“No, of course not,” he answered, chuckling indulgently. “It was another name. The one I used to go by. I’m being cagey again, aren’t I?”

“Very.”

“Okay, well, I literally just remembered who I used to be. But I’d prefer if you still called me Frankie.” He moved over to sit down beside me, and after I gave him a small nod, he wrapped his arm around me. One of my tentacles came up to rest on the back of his neck. “That annoying news-woman was right about me. I can do some stuff that’s… irregular.”

“Besides walking and talking?”

He huffed and pinched my earlobe. “Rude. But yeah. Hell, I’m confused, too. Not as much as I used to be, but I got no idea how to tell you this.”

“Your old name. What was it?”

“Qirin,” he said, after a short period of silence. “I was Qirin, the wrath of life sent unto the world unbidden.”

“That’s a pretty long name.”

“Which is why I’d rather you kept calling me Frank.”

“So what are you? An angel or something?” I’m not big on the biblical stuff, not on any human religion, but it was the first thing that had popped into my head. *Divine.*

“Pretty much the opposite,” he answered with a wry, shaky smirk.

“You’ll have to be more precise.”

“Does it really matter what I am exactly?” he asked, nervously fingering his bubble gum. “I mean, you said you’d like me even if I was a squonk! So *what* if I’m not a squonk but an ancient evil spirit worshiped by people who made human sacrifices to please me… That doesn’t change anything between us, right?” He closely inspected my expression. “Christ, you’re scary. I would actually prefer being a squonk right now.”

I grunted.

“Do you want me to leave?” he inquired.

I reached for his hand. “No. So, these human sacrifices…”

“Oh, Sunshine, that’s so four hundred BC… The times of the Ancient Ones are over. Everyone who used to pray for me has turned to dust centuries ago. I mean, I was weak enough to be summoned into this plastic vessel.” He gestured at his body. “I’d been asleep for so long; my mind got all screwy when I took over the doll. I guess I was simply overwhelmed. I was able to bring the other puppets to life, so I suppose I haven’t lost any of my abilities. I only forgot that I had them.” He turned to me, an excited smile flickering across his features. “I used to do that with these huge stone idols. I wish I’d had the chance to show you.”

“That does sound impressive. I’d still like to circle back to the human sacrifices…”

“It was more like something my cult did, back when I had one. But it isn’t going to happen again. I can’t physically hurt anybody. Philomena fucking Wallis, remember? So I made your lamp flicker, but for all I know, that’s it. I have no idea if I can do anything else, and I’m definitely not gonna murder anyone.”

“Don’t you want a new cult?”

“No. Look, I know I complain a lot but I actually… oh, I can’t believe I’m saying this… I *like* living the way I do. Cults are a ton of work. And once the humans were done with the sermons, they’d have orgies. Every damn time. Super uncomfortable to watch.”

I told him I understood, but that this was a lot to take in nonetheless. He promised to tell me everything about his former life, but suggested we first talk to Mary Markov to clear up some things. Thus, we got into his car. I grabbed a bottle of coconut water from the glove compartment—I'm rather glad he's taken to bringing them with him whenever he comes around. That helped soothe my nerves. I leaned back in my seat, relaxing as I glanced over at Frankie. I couldn't help it; I kept imagining his Ancient form. "So how big were you? Did you really have a bull's head?"

"Oh, I was *big*. About twice or thrice the size of a human. And yes, I did; a white one."

"And you had wings, too?"

"M-hm."

"What color were those?"

"I don't quite recall. Probably golden, or yellow maybe."

"How big were your horns?"

He let out a laugh. "Sunshine, I have no idea. I didn't really look into mirrors a lot back then."

I smiled faintly. "You must have been majestic."
