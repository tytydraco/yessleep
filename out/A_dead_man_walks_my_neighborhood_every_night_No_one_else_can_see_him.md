I was on the far side of my neighborhood when I saw him for the first time. The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts; that was the first thing I noticed about him. We walked toward each other, me crossing the street as an SUV slowly approached.

I was looking at the ground, but when he walked past me I felt a surge of heat, like an oven door had just opened. With it came a fetid air like that of burnt plastic. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street; that’s when I noticed the second thing.

The SUV came to a rolling stop at the stop sign. I screamed out and threw my hands in the air as I ran toward them, but the car passed right through the man as if he wasn’t there. He continued to walk with his eyes forward. It was only then, looking at him closely, that I noticed the third thing: he was translucent, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out the dark shadow of a house.

I watched him until he turned the corner. Then I ran home, looking over my shoulder every so often to make sure the ghost wasn’t following me.

At the time, my life was purgatory. I was 22 and had just graduated college. I was living with my parents and hadn’t found a “real” job yet. I worked about 20 hours a week at a local grocery store and spent the rest of my time applying for jobs.

I had this constant urge to do something crazy: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while I worked on my screenplays. Maybe I could sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van. I wanted something new and exciting. I didn’t care if the new and exciting was a *bad* new and exciting. 

I guess that’s why I went back to the street where I first saw the ghost.

He wasn’t there the first few times I went, but I could always smell him, that pungently sour burnt smell, sometimes more fresh than others. It became a routine; I felt like a paranormal investigator.

One Sunday evening, walking about twenty feet behind a couple pushing a baby in a stroller, there he was, walking towards us. Same t-shirt, same shorts. I stopped where I was and just watched. 

Neither he nor the family gave any indication that they saw each other. The ghost walked with its eyes resolutely forward, the mom and dad continued their conversation. And then the ghost walked through them.

I found myself biting my thumb as he approached me. My heart was hammering so loud that I barely heard the next car driving by. But I was determined to hold my ground. If there was a chance to experience something new I wanted to face it. There had to be a reason why only I could see him.

The heat and smell consumed me as he walked by. I became incredibly dizzy; I saw stars. 

Then he was walking past me. I followed.

The walk didn’t last much longer, less than five minutes. We turned a corner, he walked toward the first house on the right, then disappeared as he entered the front yard.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man roughly my age. He was looking down at me and smiling like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A little kid who just solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school yet.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, didn’t you?”

I nodded.

“That’s how I found him too. He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know. Like I said, I found him the same way. You wanna get a cup of coffee?”

I was so taken aback that I laughed. He flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” He asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me. And maybe you can tell me more about you.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. Either way, 15 minutes later we had our drinks and were sitting down outside a local coffee shop.

“So, how often do you see ghosts?” He asked.

“Not often,” I said. I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time. I wanted to seem cooler than I really was, like we were both a part of this selective club.

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink. 

I learned that his old house was across the street from where we’d seen the ghost, but now he lived in his own apartment in the city. He just liked to watch the man sometimes. He said it was the only ghost he’d ever seen that never left.

After that day we started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get coffee, other times it was dinner, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first coffee date. To some degree I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation; he hid it well, but I could tell that he was always holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. I felt bad for him.

Most importantly, he was my key to the world’s secrets.

So when one day he asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be closer to him. Not sex, although that wasn’t something I was opposed to; I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, what kind of shampoo he used, I wanted to *know* him, and you can’t know someone unless you know how they live when they’re alone.

So we went to his apartment. He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes. 

He showed me to his room: a bed, a desk, and a computer.

“You sure know how to live.”

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible.”

It didn’t make a lot of sense to me at first. I mean, was being outside inherently better than being inside? Over time I’ve realized that what he really cared about was having a reason for everything he did. He never wanted to go to bed feeling like he wasted his day, and he didn’t want to die feeling like he wasted his life. He didn’t mind being home if he was home for a reason: to write because that’s where his desk was, to sleep because that’s where his bed was, but he never wanted to waste time. That’s what was important.

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me.

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, wait a few seconds, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made me just do it. I wanted to make him happy. There was just something so sad about him.

I gave him about fifteen seconds. There weren’t a lot of places to hide inside the apartment, but it took me a long time to find him because I was walking so slowly. I thought he was planning to jump out and scare me.

I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. I opened the towel closet half joking, but found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. When I reached for him he straightened his legs and scooted out. He stood up and I kissed him.

It wasn’t exactly how I expected our first time to go, but yes, that was it. For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd make love. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either, and it made him happy, so I did it.

We were lying in his bed one night, no hiding and no seeking, my head on his chest, when he told me everything.

He saw a ghost for the first time while he was playing in his backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog which had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he saw a grey man in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she was smarter about how she dished them out. She hit him in places where no one could see the evidence: his chest and his back. She thought she could beat the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her over an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said. “Part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

“How’d she die?”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar. She found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch away he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her no.

When she tried to hit him with the other hand he caught that one too. He let go and she tried to hit him again and again, but each time he caught her arm. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he that found her, dead in her bed, with another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he said.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down it went swiftly through him like a knife slicing a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“*You’re* a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window one last time, he saw her, searching for him.

“I think it has something to do with trauma,” he said. “Or purpose. Sometimes I think they’re the same thing. I was her trauma, and her purpose was to stop me. She thought beating me could stop me. And when she couldn’t beat me anymore… she had no purpose. She’s stuck living in a world where she’s always trying to find me, even when I’m not there.”

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and I looked for him harder than ever.

The next day we went to see the ghost again. 

“Why do you think he’s still here?” I asked.

“Trauma, I guess.”

“And how come I can see him?”

“You’re probably connected somehow. You seem them more strongly when you are.”

We watched him for hours until he disappeared. I’ve always wondered where he goes when he’s not there. Is he stuck somewhere in between our world and elsewhere? Does he choose to come back, or is he forced to?

Over time I began to feel strange and guilty about our hide-and-seek. Was I helping him heal him from his trauma, or forcing him to stay in it? 

I drifted away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day, to hanging out once a week. He tried to reach out, but I always had some reason why I couldn’t come over. Once a week turned to every other week. Then we were just texting every so often.

At some point we became strangers. 

I found a job as a tutor. It was full-time and I found myself enjoying the work, looking forward to sessions, and feeling as though I *did* have a purpose: helping these kids get into college. Life was good; I didn’t need to chase something extreme to feel like I was living.

But like most experiences, once I settled into normalcy, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. There wasn’t a point in what I was doing. These kids were all rich, and with their parents’ money they were going to be fine without my help anyway. I was just another servant to make their lives easier. In the same way that they could clean their houses without maids, they could study without a tutor. It would just take effort.

When I got bored I started reaching out again. I texted him a few times and he didn’t answer, but I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two months later and I’d never replied.

I went to the street to watch the ghost again. I wondered what his trauma was. After a while, it felt like watching the Northern Lights must after enough time. It was cool and all, but, if I couldn’t be a part of it, what was the point? I wanted to live excitement, I didn’t just want to watch.

I got in my car and drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, but when he didn’t answer I went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. As ashamed as I am to admit it, I started to get angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement, my joy.

There was only one of him. I couldn’t just go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for three hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name a couple of times. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. After a moment I realized that he *was* sinking into it. The body in the tub was his ghost.

“Oh God,” I cried.

He looked up at me and smiled. “You found me.”

“What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

“You were using me.”

I paused for a second, tried to think of a response, then gave in, crying. “Yes, I was. But I still care. I’m sorry.”

He didn’t respond, just stayed curled in a ball.

“Why are you still here? Why can’t you move on?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t respond for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“There’s a door. But I don’t know what’s on the other side.”

“You need to go. You don’t want to be stuck here forever.”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

There was nothing to say; it was too late. I left.
