Somewhere in the middle of the night, where time has as much influence as an ant during the holocaust. An endless road lies under the moon, housing a decrepit alley. An alleyway that breathes.

Last Month, I experienced this nightmare firsthand. I need to tell someone about this, before my memory fades again. This place, the street, that Thing, all of it so no one makes the same mistake me and many others have made in the past. From the moment I entered that lonesome road, my recollection of how long I was there has been distorted. Could have been millions of years or a minute. Each step ranged from several hours to a few seconds with almost no In between. There is no way to tell how long I was trapped, the only thing I do know is when I escaped, it was 12:01 a.m the next day. Please listen closely if you like to venture out during the night, because it just may save you from purgatory.

New York, a city I had longed to live in for my entire life. Growing up in a rural area located in Michigan with a family that had little to no interest in leaving their nice little comfy home, standing somewhere in between nowhere to fuck-all. It was not a place I wanted to spend the rest of my life in. My parents were always supportive of anything I did, besides  me moving to New York. They never told me why, but they always tried to convince me to move to a different city or stay with them. I honestly don’t think they even knew why, always telling me how bad things happen in New York and how they just didn’t want me there. I never listened to their wishes, though I wish I had. When I finally escaped, taking up an IT job for a manufacturing company that I cannot legally say on here, I was able to get a small studio apartment not too far from my place of work. This is where the fantasy had quickly gone away. This city was not the utopia I hoped for, but instead a viscous concrete jungle where gun fire and screaming crackheads constantly kept me up at night. Maybe if I had picked a different part of town I could have avoided all of these horrors, a nice one bedroom apartment where all I had to worry about was the old lady next door bringing me too many cookies. But no, thanks to the lovely world of greed and capitalism, this was the only affordable apartment at the moment. The only positive was its short proximity to my job, where I could walk to work everyday. Though, I would gladly take a longer drive for the rest of my life, than have a chance to be brought back in view of that damn alley.

I wasn’t the only one in my family who had this dream of leaving their home. My older sister (Sarah Marshall), had moved here a few years ago. We had the same vision of moving to the city to explore a lavish life, I wonder how disappointed she was when she got here. We had stopped talking a few months after her departure. I don’t remember if it was a fight or if it was just a natural fade that drove us apart, but either way I haven’t talked to her in years. A part of me was hoping to maybe reconnect with her after the move, but soon I found out that I couldn’t contact her or even find where she lived. I remember us joking, as kids, that if we ever got lost, we would be able to find each other by looking for our crescent shaped birthmarks. My family had this weird genetic thing where most if not all my family are born with a crescent mark on our body. This Jojo-like mark has been theorized to date back way too far, some of us even saying to medieval times. Now, how they know that, I couldn’t tell you. But anyway, my birthmark was on the nape of my neck. Sarah also had hers located on the neck, it was just closer to her jaw. The plan of us finding each other like that obviously never worked though. Our child brains didn’t take into account the massive population a city holds and how weird it would be to try and find someone by just looking at random strangers' necks. I never did find her and I don’t think I ever will, things changed since that night.

It was a beautiful night out, so beautiful that I (Timothy Marshall) decided to go on a midnight stroll to my local convenience store “Johns Cellar”. Believe me, I know how that sounds but I kid you not some person, probably named John, decided to call a store that. Surprisingly not a human trafficking store, at least that I know of. It sold all the essentials I needed to survive for the week, instant ramen and redbull. Somehow this is not the worst part of this tale. But all and all safe to say I was pretty new to the area, only moving here a week ago at the time. I only found this place when looking at my GPS for nearby stores. To my surprise, it was only a 6 minute walk from my apartment. Weirdly with no time of arrival. For a moment, this struck me as odd because even though I have only lived here for a short while, I hadn’t seen this store anywhere nearby. The thought eventually passed as I chalked it up to just not exploring as much as I should have. If only I would have listened to that voice that told me to go to another store, maybe then I could dream again.

When I left my home that night, it was like any other night. Busy city, and a lot of people. Making sure to grab my now lucky pocket knife, I started to make my drawn out journey of 6 minutes to the store. As I walked down the steps and towards “John's Cellar”, I saw that there was some sort of accident down the street, off the course of my given path. It looked horrible, a blue honda civic had driven straight into the side of a building. Pink fuzzy dice hanging sadly from the rear view mirror. Something about the car reminded me of someone, I couldn’t remember who though. The thought vanished as I saw a crowd of people around the scene, most in their pajamas. From the crowd, I heard whispers of how the crash woke them up and how incompetent people are at driving. Disregarding the fact that on the street right next to them, there was a body bag. It was nowhere near empty. It looks like when the car crashed, someone in the building lost their life. This city was getting better and better the longer I was here. The street was going to be closed for a while from the looks of it. The beginnings of a crime scene were taking place. At that instant I decided to maybe continue walking before I got confused as a witness. The time was 11:58, 3 minutes until arrival.

As I continued I came near the supposed last stretch, Race rd. On my gps, it was a short distance, about a block from the store. When looking at the street, it was near impossible to actually see down it. The lights of the road had seemed to be broken. The darkness though, was unlike anything I have ever experienced. A wall in this fabric of reality where nothing, not even light can pass through, it was very surreal. Like somehow the colorful lights of the city didn’t exist beyond it. Now I would love to say I didn’t go through this road, I saw this supernatural thing and turned around to go to a different store on a different day. But before I got the chance to finish that thought. I found myself, as if in a trance, walking into the darkness. The lack of light didn’t last for long though, as the void was quickly illuminated from the street lights ahead. As if my presence by itself turned them on. A sigh of relief waved over me and I continued onward, scrolling through my phone. The time was 12:00 am, 1 minute till arrival.

I walked, I walked, and I walked. When I finally took my eyes off my phone, due to losing service, I realized something funny. I hadn’t moved an inch, oh god why did I go down this damn road. I looked around to see if it was just similar surroundings playing a trick on me. As I scanned I noticed the previously lit streetlights were now once again, all off. That wasn’t the thing that caught my eyes first though. What did was the small, tiny, and insignificant fact that the street ahead of me didn’t end. The buildings that stood parallel didn’t either. The loud but busy background of New York had disappeared, being replaced with the silence of the night sky. Actually let me rephrase, the night sky was louder than the place I had entered. It was pure nothingness, as if when I walked through that dark wall, I actually ended up in the vacuum of space where sound was just foreign concept. It wasn’t just the sound that was gone, no the entirety of New York seemed to have vanished. Leaving the setting entirely, with the only remains being the stars, this street, and me. Previously lit by a row of streetlights, the road was now illuminated with cold beams of moonlight that parted the buildings on my left. I have never seen the moon so bright, almost as if the sun was way closer to our planet than usual, causing the moon's mirrored light to get even brighter. Not enough to cause daylight, but enough to look unnatural, uncanny even. The time was 12:00 a.m.

After I fully took in my surroundings, realization had set in. I was lost, more than lost. In fact the word lost was very offended that I even used it to describe my situation. A better word was fucked, my apologies. My first panicked instinct was to turn around and get the hell off this street. Turning around, I was greeted with the same liminal space. The road that I had previously walked on was nowhere to be seen, being replaced with the same endless road. Now I knew I wasn't walking for too long right? I went to check my phone and saw it was still 12:00 a.m. on the dot. The same time I had entered the desolate road. I have a tendency to zone out, but I knew I must have been walking for at least a few minutes. Looking back at the vast road that seemed to have no end, I couldn’t have walked that far in such a short time. So the question remained, what should I do? My first instinct was to check my GPS, hoping to see where it had taken me. Somehow I was still on route, though the instructions given made my jaw nearly fall off,  “Continue forward another 100+ miles”. I immediately started pinching myself, hoping to wake up from whatever nightmare I was in. After a few minutes of pinching, pacing, screaming, and a little bit of sobbing. I decided that the only way out was forward, for who knows how far.

I dragged my feet through this now actual drawn out journey, noticing something very quickly. I was seeing the same alley every 5 buildings. Not only that but the buildings themselves were exactly the same, each four stories a carbon copy of the last. I was on some sort of repeating road, forced to see the same block over and over again. Yes, there were blocks, something that resembled the concept at least. Two lines were placed on the street next to me, each line seemed to signify the start/end of the previous/next block. They looked like ones you’d see at a stop sign or a traffic light, so the cars knew where to stop. But there was no stop sign, no traffic light, not even a crosswalk. Just an empty patch of road as long as the width of the buildings it laid between. Behind the sidewalks, the empty stone pillars stood perfectly placed inside the zone made by the road. Each housed an extra story unlike the rest. Pointless would be the best way to describe the design. The only thing they did was let me know how many blocks I had walked.

The buildings were dormant with no notable features. Their exteriors were smooth and grey, looking almost brand new with not a single scratch on their surface. Through the windows that started from the second floor and continued up, leaving the first floor with only a door on its blank walls. The rooms were barren with no fixtures, each room looked a lot shorter than what you would expect. I swear, I had seen something move in one of the rooms but when I turned to the window. I was met with the same cramped and unimpressive layout. I tried to open the door of one of the buildings to my right, it didn’t budge. The handle was a part of the door itself, fused to it and unable to be twisted. The building was uncomfortably close with the edge of the sidewalk, not quite touching but nearly there. This left a thin space between the side of the building and the side of the sidewalk. Another thing that struck me as odd was the door seemed open outwards instead of inward, I knew this from the way the hinges were mounted with the door. Normally that’s not too crazy, but the sidewalk was an inch higher on the door than it should’ve been. So even if the door opened, it would've been stopped by the pavement. It was like this for every building. Nothing here could have been made by a human, there was no way a person could make something so impossible, so unreal. This place could have been made by an A.I. generator and I wouldn’t be surprised. An imitation of what a street should look like with no concept of reality. But the consistency of the scene changed with the alley wedged between two of the buildings.

From where the moon glowed its mystical light, the alley stood in front of me across the dotted street. Sitting proudly in the halfway point of the block, two four story complexes on each side. It was quite a bare sight in all honesty. The two grey walls making up the passageway, were seemingly in a state of decay. Scratched and worn down, it was a stark contrast to the rest of the structures. There were no doors from the buildings that lead to the area, nor were there any sort of entrance that could lead you to the apartments. Near the back of it was a 10 ft brick wall. It didn’t really match the architecture of the city, but it looked just as old. You could tell that it wasn’t always there. As if this alley was a lot bigger, only shrunken due to the disappearance of the city around it. In the sky between the two buildings, above the wall, was the moon. I hadn’t gotten a good look at it yet, its presence was almost blinding. A full moon was perfectly set in the middle of the looming buildings high in the sky, looking down on me with fleeting interest. As I wondered how I could’ve known that, my phone buzzed, even though l lost my signal awhile ago. Checking the notification, as if being mocked by the app itself the time of arrival finally appeared. The updated time was now shown as 12:01 a.m., in only about one minute. Which is how I found out that it was going to be for a while.

“What a sick joke” was the only thing I could say. The words somehow echoed through the open sky as if I were in a vast cavern. I had been here for over an hour, or at least I think. None of my stopwatch apps worked, only going to 0:00 after pressing start and never continuing. I turned and took one last look at the alley, after the echoes finally disappeared. The silence wasn’t back in its full strength. There was something faint making a noise. I realized I was already looking at the source, It was coming from the alley. A faint breathing
