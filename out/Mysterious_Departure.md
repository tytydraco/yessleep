This story was told by my friend Sebastian during a Halloween event at my school when i was in senior high school 
which surely still sends shivers down my spine.  

"Back when i was in my junior year in highschool back in 2019, just right across the street was a family of 5 which had 3 children, the eldest one named Michael was a graduating junior high, the middle child named Jeffrey was at the second year of junior high and the youngest named Gabriella was a graduating student in elementary.

I got along pretty well with Michael when i was a kid, and boy i do love asking questions but he always has answers for all of them. 

Everyday i join him and his siblings to take the tricycle to school everyday and the young ones left early at 3:00, but on that particular Thursday afternoon it was only me who left the and Michael was no where to be found outside.

When i waited outside for Michael but he was nowhere to be found so i went to ask his teachers and they said he left already.

I went home too and saw him with dark circles under his eyes and that he looks stressed and tired which is pretty common among all highschool students but not for him because back then he was always happy and upbeat but now as school gets more and more tiring and stressful the more it puts pressure on him as time goes on not to mention the responsibilities that he has to do at home 

I texted his siblings on why he looked like that, they said "Oh he's just staying up all night cause he has a lot of homework and projects to do, he also lost his wallet on the way home.", so i just sent and ok emoji and did my homework to which was a bit hard since its only the third year of junior high.

By the time it was at 10:00 pm i was already at bed watching anything that pops up on YouTube until i heard a gate open, turns out it was Michael but was he doing outside? 

On his right hand was a piece of paper and within seconds a group of black cats and dogs walk in front of him, and as i watched from a little gap within the curtain the cats and dogs started to transform into humanoid-like creatures with thick black hair and long and pointy claws and ears, the middle one was taller and more wider than him, it must be their leader, around it where more creatures just like it but they where on the ground in a crawling state and they where smaller than the big one in the middle, they must be its minions.

Within the background i see Micheal give the piece of paper to the big creature and it read it, and in a blink of an eye he vanished, i was terrified and shocked from what i just witness.

I couldn't sleep that night, by the time it was morning, when we where having breakfast with my parents on a Friday morning i told them what happened last night and they told me they where a group of Aswang, creatures of the night with an insatiable thirst for blood, they can take forms of either a black cat, dog or pig and sometimes a normal human form.

They ask what was the piece of paper that he was holding and what did it read, i also didn't know what i read.

As i continue my day i couldn't get rid of what i just saw from that night, and later on as nighttime falls when i was at bed at 10:00 pm i heard something outside like something was banging or metal sheets as i looked outside.

I saw the creatures again and the leader was holding Micheal's lifeless body along with a wooden coffin, his body was filled with stitches around his body. 

He wasn't moving, then the creatures placed his body in the coffin, in a funeral like position and the left him there with the same paper on it but it's now covered with blood. 

After what felt like hours, u checked the time and sure enough it was midnight which is good enough for me to curiously check out his body and what happened to it, as i snuck out through my bedroom door and past my parents' bedroom i walked downstairs and unlocked the door quietly and opened it as i walked outside the house and approached Micheal's dead body i picked up the piece of paper and it read

"Before you kill me like a savage beast or take my soul and add it to your collection of victims, here's what you have to do:
1. After killing me pickup the rest of my remains and put it on a wooden coffin which is at my backyard
2. Place me in a funeral like position
3. Leave without being seen"

I was terrified and sad from what i read, knowing that he is now gone forever and that it is not safe anymore to go outside at night, and that he took his own life with the assistance from supernatural beings.

In the morning the family held a funeral for Micheal and the police reported it as murder and assault due to the amount of bruises and stitches around his body which indicated that he died from losing too much blood, I don't know if i can recover from all of this."
