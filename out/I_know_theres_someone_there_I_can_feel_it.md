My name is Senan and I hate people, always have. They terrify me with their cruelty and their ability to hurt one another in unspeakable ways and feel no remorse. The thought of being around people makes me so physically ill that I have chosen to seclude myself. To remove myself from this awful world and live my life out is blissful ignorance and isolation. I have done this for many years now and will continue to do so for as long as God allows.



I will give no clue as to where I live, however, for fear of those who would seek me out. I will only say that it is remote and it is beautiful. Over these years, I have cultivated my own small piece of heaven. A farm just large enough to sustain myself with a small orchard of various fruits, a modest vegetable patch and a few carefully selected cows and chickens. I used to keep ducks but I found they smelled too bad to be worth keeping around. Then there were the goats, they had an awful habit of getting their heads stuck in the enclosure. It wasn't uncommon that I would wake to find one dead and hanging from those barbed wire fences. So now it's just the cows and chickens.



I’m not much one for this site as I've found the people on it to be rather callous and mean spirited. Having said this, I am here now to seek help. I have found reason to believe that there is someone watching me, trying to get close to me. I’ve felt it for the better part of a week now. The uneasy itch crawling up my arms and back, vibrating up my spine and sending my head spinning. I hate it. I just want it to stop, to go away. I just want to be left alone. Why can’t people ever just leave me alone.



I know I must sound mad. It must sound like I’ve finally lost it after so long without being near another soul but I’m begging anyone who will listen to believe me. I know this feeling and I know that I wouldn't just feel it for no reason. There is a person watching me and I think they're getting closer.



It all started last week when I was feeding the chickens. Clementine, Constance, Catherine and Casandra were pecking around at the feed I threw on the floor. It was about to rain so I was trying to feed them quickly. I was in the process of changing their water when I first got the feeling. Like when you've just eaten and you try to pick something up, the sensation of my breakfast rushing up my throat only to stop just behind my teeth. I remember how my hands got sweaty and my heart started racing. My back suddenly felt too exposed and my skin was on fire, itchy and burning. I think I just dropped whatever I was holding and ran inside. I didn’t even think to look around. The sight of someone in that moment probably would have been enough to kill me. 



That distressing feeling has since had moments of calm but it has never quite gone away. It is in recent days that it has actually gotten worse, growing to the point that I cannot bring myself to cross the field and feed the cows. I suppose that I should explain the layout of my farm a bit better. I actually own two separate pieces of land, both small and along the same back road but they're divided by a humble plot owned by my neighbour, who despite all his kindness, I’ve never been inclined to get to know. He thankfully has treated me in kind, letting me continue my solitary life. Regardless, I'm getting myself muddled. I mention this to say that for these past few days, I have been unable to bring myself to cross that man's field to tend to my cows and for all my coldness he seems to have taken notice enough to tend to them himself. Should this paralysing sensation pass, I will be sure to send him a basket of eggs in way of thanks.



It’s as I write this I gain a better appreciation for all those writers out there that are able to get what they need to say across in a concise manner. I believe I have a niece that’s an author or maybe it was a cousin. These years have left me a bit confused. Perhaps, should this person finally leave me alone, I might give my brother a call. Although I struggle to remember his face let alone his phone number, a postcard will have to do. I do hope he hasn't moved. He could be dead for all I know. What a morbid thought.



I must focus, these sleepless nights have left my hands shaking and my mind wandering. I was always one to lose track of my thoughts but lately, I'm lucky to have a coherent thought at all. It’s in the night when it's the worst. The feeling burrows under my skin making its way like a disease through my cracked knuckles, entering my blood and sending bolts of fearful energy through my body. The fear is alive in me, it’s its own entity sharing my body with my soul. Will there be enough room for the two of us or will my fear force my soul out? Discard it like the feathered cadaver of a pine martens kill, a senseless act brought about when the failings of life take the place of compassion. The pine marten does not kill because it is hungry, like the fox. No, the pine marten kills simply because it wants to, it is much like humans in that regard. Maybe this person wishes to hurt me. Perhaps, they’ve been watching to best learn when to attack but oh I'm on to them, yes sirree. They won't get the jump on old Senan.



I'll set traps. I've decided. I'll set them around my immediate property, I still cannot bring myself to venture too far from the house. I will use my old hunting gear, never had much use for it before but as the saying goes ‘It is always better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it’. That’s a good plan, that. I'll lay a few good traps and head off to bed early. The night is not safe.



I'll report back again tomorrow. In the meantime any advice or even reassurances are greatly appreciated. The internet is a vast place, just maybe one of you will know what to do. Until tomorrow, may God allow me a safe night and may he bless those who read this message.
