TW: sexual assult

\*\*\*

I think there's something wrong with Dustin.

And it doesn't have to do with the fact that Rudy smashed out the liftback's back passenger door in his escape the other day. Which, yeah, Dustin was really pissed about that.

If you're new, you can read what I've been covering in my therapy sessions: [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/comments/1gpe8cd/guide_to_im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police/)

No, he’s been awfully… *clingy* lately. It’s weird.

What else is weird is how fast he got released from the hospital with the injuries he’d sustained. Dustin was barely in there for three days before being discharged.

I found out about it during my debrief meeting with Lieutenant Dawn.

“Take a seat,” Cameron had said, spinning around in his official looking office chair like a Bond villain.

I did as my Lieutenant instructed after softly closing the door behind me. A nervous exhale escaped as I sat down on the rickety chair in front of his desk. For days I’d been avoiding him, his emails, and having this conversation. “Sir, before we start, I would just like to say-“

“Tut, tut, tut,” Dawn said suddenly, leaning forward and putting his pointer finger on his lips. “Save it, officer,” he then touched the tips of his fingers together, resting his elbows on the lip of the desk. “Jane already debriefed me, so trust me when I tell you I’ve already heard *everything* I need to know and then some.“

“Actually, I was going to go easy on Rudy since he helped us out alot, but okay,” I interjected.

“The good news is: you get to keep your job,”Cameron said, leaning back. His intimidating presence eased a little.

I furrowed my brows. “If that’s the good news, then…”

“We’re releasing the revenant. A matter I know your feelings on. Or, at least, *thought* I did. Based on that request, I take it that might’ve changed?” The side of the Lieutenant’s lips curled up slightly into a sly smirk. His eyes narrowed into suspicious slits as he awaited my response.

I scoffed and crossed my arms into my chest, suppressing the urge to slap that grin off his face. “No. That can’t happen. Even if he isn’t running around serially sucking people dry like juice boxes, Rudy is still a revenant. Regardless if he can function normally like you or I, dude’s a ticking time bomb. And did you forget that one: he literally escaped our custody, *twice!* And two: illegally hunts down supernaturals as a profession?!”

“He was framed for those murders and we don’t even know his real name, Lucky. Legally, we can’t hold him.” Dawn countered with a shrug of his shoulders. “We need the space downstairs.”

A nasty scowl made its way onto my face in protest. Imaginary daggers were cutting teeny-tiny holes in Lieutenant Dawn’s carotid artery as I stared up at him.

“Besides, don’t think I haven’t forgotten. He *will* be serving time, albeit in an unconventional way,” he said, trying to ease my nerves.

It was my turn to narrow my eyes into suspicious slits. “And what ‘unconventional way’ would that be exactly?” I asked using finger quotes.

“That information is on a need to know basis. And when you need to know, I’ll tell you.”

Internally, I rolled my eyes. “Great.”

“Also, speaking of escapes,” the cheeky glint swirling in his Dawn’s eyes told me I wasn’t getting out of this one, “the cost of repairs for the interrogation room door will be coming straight out of your paycheck.”

“*Great.*” my eyeballs rolled for real that time as I blew a stray lock of hair out of view.

Cameron let the awkward silence that filled the air between us sit there for about two whole seconds before he leaned in even closer, practically hanging off the side of his desk.

“In the chance of sounding unprofessional, I do want to know what happened with that werewolf. Jane told me he was your stalker?”

My gaze flickered to my hands which laid idle on my knees. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

“That’s fair,” Dawn admitted. “But you do know his pack mates will come looking for who killed him, right? They won’t stop until justice has been served.”

“I know,” I said, pressing my lips into a hard line, trying to ignore the sinking feeling of dread lingering in the back of my mind. “I can’t stop thinking about it.”

“Good. Just be careful and watch your back.” Cameron nodded his head firmly, conveying to me the seriousness in his warning.

Just as seriously, I replied, “Always.”

A light, frantic, knock came from the other side of the door.

“Come in,” Lieutenant Dawn called out over my shoulder, slipping back into the comfort of his chair.

Jane pushed the door open, quickly stepped into the office, then closed the door behind her.

“Dustin’s out of the hospital. They just released him.”

“WHAT?!” I asked, turning around in my chair to gawk at her. “Say that again?”

“The hospital discharged Dustin. He just texted me, look.” Jane shoved her phone into my face. It was open to a text conversation between him and her.

Frantically, I grabbed and checked my phone. No notifications, nothing. A twinge of guilt and sadness shot through my stomach. *Why did he text Jane instead of me? I’m his partner. He’s not mad at me is he?*

Another ping came from Jane’s phone. “Ope, he just texted me again. He’s on his way here to drop off his paperwork so he can come back to work tomorrow.”

I turned around to find Lieutenant Dawn sitting there looking indifferent. “Tell him I’m glad he’s feeling better and I’ll see him when he gets here.”

Jane nodded swiftly, accepting her assignment. She then pivoted on her heel and started to type away on her phone’s keyboard as she left the Lieutenant’s office.

As soon as the door had closed again, I shot him a look. Lieutenant Dawn held my gaze, prompting me to challenge him. Challenge him, I did.

“Are you sure that’s a good idea? Letting him return to work so soon?”

“Why?” He asked, almost defensively. “Need I remind you Ms. Hale, that you started working for the division *two days* after I recruited you.”

I shrugged my shoulders, unable to argue with that logic. “I’m just saying, Cameron, that I got choked out by a siren and you made me take two weeks leave.”

He didn’t say anything for a minute after that, only rhythmically tapped the tip of his finger on the desk. It felt like he was debating telling me something, but decided against it as the finger tapping stopped and Lieutenant Dawn sighed. “If the doctor says he can work, he can work.”

The stare he gave me signified that was all that was going to be said regarding the matter. Begrudgingly, I accepted that. “Alright.”

“You are dismissed,” he said, flicking his wrist at the door absentmindedly as he began pilfering through a large stack of papers. He stopped briefly to look over at me with small smile and said, “Have a good day, *officer*.”

Taking that as my cue to leave, I quickly excused myself and left relieved. Not only did I get to keep my job, but Cameron had all but confirmed it and made it official. I was not a rookie anymore.

That feeling didn’t last long as a flood of all consuming anxiety quickly washed it away. On top of worrying about Dustin’s wellbeing, I now had to deal with the revenant’s release and figure out how to afford my groceries for the month too. Trying to ignore that feeling, I did as I do best and threw myself into the work at hand.

My nose had been buried deep into an arrest report I’d been writing when my concentration was interrupted by a sudden tap on my shoulder. I turned around to see Dustin standing behind me. He looked worse for wear and was carrying a nice floral arrangement.

Like a missile, I crashed into his arms, bombarding him with a hug. I was real glad to see him even though I’d visited him the night before.

“Hey partner,” he said like a dope after our hug ended, holding out the bouquet of fresh flowers for me to take.

I was reluctant to grab them. My brows furrowed as I said, “You were the one who was just in hospital. Shouldn’t *I* be the one giving *you* flowers?”

He rubbed the back of his neck and blushed, “Yeah, well, what you went through was pretty traumatic too. These were the least I could do to say thanks. You did save my life after all.”

*Let’s not forget I’m the reason you almost lost it in the first place.* I thought to myself.

“Your eye!” I exclaimed, pointing at the appendage, stealthily changing the subject.

“What about my eye It’s still there isn’t it?” Dustin asked like a goofball.

“Yes, but last I saw you it was swollen and bruised, like your eye socket had been broken! It looks perfectly fine now.” A beat passed as I quickly analyzed him. With a serious sounding, “tsk,” I grabbed his shoulders and looked him dead in the eyes, “Black eyes don’t heal like that in a day, Dustin.”

He nonchalantly shrugged me off his shoulders, “They gave me an ointment.”

“An ointment?”

“Yes, an ointment. Who would’ve thought: the advancements of modern medicine,” he answered sarcastically, waving his hand across the air in fake amusement.

I looked up at him skeptically. In return, Dustin looked down at me with a pathetic smile. He still looked like crap. He was covered in bandages, his hair was all tousled and unkept. The bags under his eyes were heavy. Dustin was definitely tired and not fully at one hundred percent.

Like I mentioned earlier, the man looked worse for wear.

My lips pressed into a thin line as I wearily asked, “Nothing happened the other night right? I mean, it was a full moon and all…”

“No,” he said sternly, clenching his fists, “if that’s what you’re suggesting.” His hands relaxed. “I’m fine, really.”

Taking a second to read his eyes, I dropped the subject and gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He flashed some papers out of his pocket at me before tucking them back in again. “Anyway, I just came by to say hi. Gotta drop these off with Dawn.”

With a small smile I offered to walk with him. He readily accepted. The two of us caught up with what had happened since last we saw each other as we traversed the precinct’s hallways. A minute later we arrived at the Lieutenant’s office.

Dustin stood outside the door, awkwardly rolling on the balls of his feet. He pulled his paperwork out again. Davidson thanked me for the nice chat before lightly knocking and announcing his presence. Cameron called him in.

I thanked Dustin for the flowers and told him it was good to see that he was feeling better and that I’d see him at work tomorrow, then gracefully bid him adieu.

I walked back to my desk at a brisk pace, ignoring the gnawing feeling at the back of my mind that *something* was wrong.

***

“What the fuck is this shit?” I muttered to myself as I pulled into my driveway. Something had been taped to the outside of my mailbox. It looked like some kind of note.

Taking a loaded handgun out of my glovebox, I cautiously exited my beat up truck and started to investigate the scene.

*’A life for a life.’*

My heart sank to the bottom of my stomach as I read the note. In case the perpetrators who left the note were still in the area, I fired one warning shot into the ground. Didn’t have to be a detective to figure out who’d left the message.

My property was warded and surrounded by mountain ash, the mailbox was made out of a special blend of iron and silver so no supernatural could look inside and get a peek at my name. With the way the note had been placed it was as if it had been put there in a hurry, like they’d been in pain. That could only mean one thing.

The Pack had found me.

I quickly retreated to my car and raced up the driveway to the safety of the cabin, barricading myself in the living room. It was a central location in the house so if someone somehow managed to get through my protective barrier I was ready to take them on.

To put my mind at ease about a potential break in, I continued working through the Sage Walker case. She was still at large, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting victims who knows where by now. There had to be something that could indicate where she could’ve went.

A pair of headlights flashed through my front windows as a car rolled up the driveway. I’d literally been knee deep in crime scene photos, closely analyzing them for clues when a knock came from the front door.

Exercising caution I carefully got up, wiping a stray Polaroid that had stuck to my knee in the process. As more knocks emanated from the front door, I snuck a peak behind the curtains, feeling like a trespasser in my own home making sure the tenants hadn’t come back early. The tension melted out of my shoulders as I saw it was Dustin’s liftback still running in the driveway. When had it gotten dark out anyway?

The poor car had definitely seen better days. On top of the usual wear and tear, a wooden panel had been fastened in place of the back door until it could be replaced.

With a sigh of relief, I opened the front door. The sight that met me was baffling. There was nobody there. Suddenly a low growl filled the air. A shiver traveled up my spine as I looked down. A horrified yelp left my mouth as I involuntarily stepped back.

Standing out on my porch was none other than The White Wolf. Noah.

*Didn’t I kill him?*

He let out a menacing growl before pouncing on me, his gaping maw aiming right for my throat. The last thing I saw before blacking out were those haunting yellow eyes…

I awoke with a start, clutching my chest as I gasped for breath. My ears rung and blood rushed from my heart and into my ears. An intense wave of nausea hit, making me want to vomit.

As my mind cleared and the realization set in that I had in fact, *not* died and it had been a nightmare, the ringing in my ears started sounding more like loud knocks. Lifting myself up off of the crime scene photo pillow I’d been laying on, I started to investigate, wiping off a stray photo that had stuck to my knee.

A peek behind my curtains revealed the liftback sitting there running at the top of my driveway. The vehicle and wooden board were both positioned in the exact same place as in my dream.

More knocks from behind my front door rang out.

An unsettling sense of Deja Vu started bubbling up in the pit of my stomach as my gaze focused on the front door. The image of The White Wolf lunging and attacking me flashed in my mind.

Slowly, I creaked the front door open just enough to get a glimpse of the porch. Thankfully no wolf was waiting out there to eat me. It was only Dustin. The real Dustin. I opened the door, feeling more at ease.

“The lights were one when I pulled up so I assumed you were awake,” he blurted out.

Registering his words, my spine straightened as I wiped a strand of drool off my chin with my sleeve. My cheeks blushed a little as I cleared my throat.

“I can go if-“

“No,” I said suddenly, not wanting him to leave. “You can stay. Why are you here anyway? What time is it?”

“Late,” he answered, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “Listen, I was wondering if it would be okay if I crashed with you for a couple days? God, can’t believe I’m even saying this but- but I don’t really want to be, I dunno, *alone*, right now?”

I smiled, waving him in. “It’s okay, you can stay as long as you like.”

Though he acted stoic, it seemed like the attack had really irked him. Being possessed by a demon and mauled by a werewolf just a couple of weeks apart would do that to a man.

With a nod, Dustin ran over to the liftback, turned off the ignition, and grabbed a bag out of the back seat before coming inside.

Like a gracious host, I offered to take his coat- a beige Burberry trench-coat. Making a mental note to replace the one I’d bleed on, I said, “Nice coat.”

“Thanks,” he replied with a small chuckle, eyeing the bouquet of flowers he’d given me earlier lying on my island. “My wife got it for me for some birthday years ago.”As soon as the words left his mouth, a solemn expression took hold over his features. A longing look swirled in his eyes. Dustin never talks about his life before. No one does.

That’s how a majority of us get recruited to the Division. A member of law enforcement (or sometimes a civilian) will have a nasty run-in with a supernatural and live to tell the tale, surviving on pure instinct alone. These encounters usually involve major injuries and casualties. Both to the supernatural and, in a lot of cases, people close with the would-be recruit. Some higher up would take notice, and since the number of in the know officers are small, people get recruited all the time. Most accept the job right away, motivated to do so by many factors. Anger, sadness, revenge, answers.

It’s how I was recruited. And if any of you manage to survive a particularly gruesome supernatural encounter and lose someone dear, so would you.

“Hey, what you said,” I called out behind my shoulder, rubbing my hands down the soft fabric of the coat’s sleeves, “about me going through something too.” I turned around to face Dustin and tried to convey the sincereness of my words with my facial expression, “Well… I guess I don’t want to be alone right now either.”

“That’s good,” he said rubbing his hands together for warmth.

Admittedly, it was a little chilly in the cabin as the fire had gone out after I unknowingly fell asleep. In search of my fireplace, he looked over and instead found my makeshift suspect board in the living room.

Frantically, I began grabbing at the clutter randomly, trying to sort and put it away. My cheeks went flush, embarrassed by the mess.

“You don’t have to do all that,” Dustin chuckled, stopping me. “I’m the same way when I get consumed by a case. You should see how bad it gets. *phew!*”

Still wanting my living space to look halfway decent, I finished grabbing my assortment of pictures, files, and notes and placed them neatly on my coffee table. The couch was then free to lay on.

“Shall, I put on a fire then?” I asked, rubbing the palms down the hem of my jeans.

“Sure,” he said with a shrug of his shoulders. He picked up my flowers and unwrapped the decorative wrapping. “Uh, where are your scissors?”

Unwrapping a log and turning the fireplace on, I informed him, “First drawer on the left.”

“Got it, thanks!” He said as the sound of my drawer closing rang out. I then watched a he searched for a small receptacle to place the bouquet in. Dustin deemed a cylindrical white ceramic dish as satisfactory. He angled the stems of the flowers before cutting off about a quarter lengths worth of plat flesh. He poured a little water into the dish then the food packet that came with the flowers. He used his finger to mix the sweet solution before gently steeping the stems in.

When all was said and done, Dustin faltered beside the beautiful bouquet, leaning his body weight against the counter as he scrunched his eyes closed.

“Are you alright?” I asked, making my way over to him.

“Yeah,” he said out of breath, “just got a bit of a headache is all.”

“Do I need to take you back to the hospital?”

He took a deep breath in before opening his eyes. He sounded playful when he said, “You sound like a concerned parent.”

I crossed my arms and raised my eyebrows at him.

Dustin put up his hands defensively. “Nothing a Tylenol and good rest won’t fix.”

I let out a huff, “Not without dinner you won’t,” and migrated over to the cabinet that held my mugs. I took out one with a sunflower design on it and started boiling water in my tea kettle. While that was going, I took out some left over spaghetti and heated it up in the microwave. Dustin took the meal gleefully, shoveling in forkful after forkful until nothing was left.

Once the water was finished, I filled the mug and took out a pack of peppermint tea. While the hot beverage cooled to a drinkable temperature, I fished out a bottle of Tylenol and shook out four white pills.

As Dustin took his medicine and finished his meal, I set up a makeshift bed for him on the couch, lending him my firmest pillow and warmest blanket.

After making sure my partner was squared away for the evening, I retreated into my bedroom after saying good night. It was difficult getting comfortable as I found it hard to go to sleep that night. Partly because of the nightmare and the ominous note on the mailbox. Worst of all, a feeling of dread still lingered. And not knowing the cause of it was maddening.

In an attempt to distract myself, I shifted my thoughts to the guest in the living room. Instead of making them better, it only made the feeling worse.

He got through the wards, I reminded myself. He should be fine.

At some point I finally managed to fall into a fitful sleep. And I’m not sure if it was another nightmare or not, but I think I saw a shadowy figure standing in the doorway, watching over me as I slept.

***

Someone came up behind me and knocked on my desk. “Rudy’s out if you’re ready to go talk to him.”

I turned and forced a smile at Detective Davidson. He’d been crashing with me for almost a week at that point and I was kind of getting annoyed by his presence. Not one moment did I have alone. Everywhere I went, he followed. He was metaphorically suffocating me.

Passerby’s could’ve mistaken him as my clingy younger brother, honestly. But given everything he’s been through, I didn’t have the heart to ask him to leave.

“Let’s go,” I said, compartmentalizing the annoyed feeling into a box in my mind, grabbing my things. Dustin pivoted on his heel and led the way. Even though I wanted to talk to Rudy alone- mostly just to get some time to myself, Davidson was still my partner in all this and needed to be there.

Part of Rudy’s jailbreak punishment was spending a week in solitary confinement. The other part Lieutenant Dawn still hadn’t filled me in on. Only time would tell.

A small part of me was glad Rudy was getting out of there. For some reason I missed our little chats that went nowhere. I don’t know, maybe it was the curiosity of his lucidity that drew me in. But, a bigger part of me was scared to see what he’d become after sitting in the dark by himself for so long.

Stepping into the interrogation room, we found that the revenant was pale and gaunt looking. The best description in his case was a frail and sickly looking Victorian child.

“Jesus, did they feed you in there?” I asked, taking a seat. Dustin flipped his chair and sat down, leaning against the back of it.

“No,” Rudy chuckled ruefully. His lips were chapped and he looked tired. His eyes stayed at a permanent squint as they adjusted to the light. For our safety and his, he was still cuffed, but not chained to anything since he wasn’t our main suspect anymore. The setting was lax compared to the other times we talked to him.

“When we’re done I’ll make sure you get something to drink.” He jerked his hands away after I attempted to pat them. Respecting the boundary, my hands stayed at my side.

Rudy fiddled with his thumbs quietly for a minute. “Did ya catch her yet?”

Disappointedly, I shook my head no.

“We’re still looking,” Dustin chimed in, sounding irritated. “That’s all we’ve been doing this past week is looking.”

“You have to find her,” Rudy said, eyes going dark. “She’ll keep going until there’s nobody left.”

“Don’t you think we don’t know that?!” Dustin snapped, banging his fists on the table. That earned him a nasty glare from Rudy.

I cleared my throat, trying to clear up the tension that had formed in the air. “So, Rudy, can you think of anywhere Fake Sage could’ve gone? Anywhere at all?”

He sighed and put his head down, resting his forehead on his arms. “I already told you-“

“Yes, yes, you can’t remember a single damn thing about your life, I know,” I lamented, “But could you please just, *try* Please?!”

Our revenant friend lifted himself up, crinkling his nose and scrunching his eyes shut tight. His face turned red as he forced the gears in his head to started turning. After a moment he relaxed and let out an exasperated breath. “Nope, nothing. Sorry.”

“Even after all this time, he’s still fucking useless,” Dustin muttered under his breath.

“Hey,” I hit his shoulder, scolded him.

“The fuck did you just say?” Rudy asked, his eyes flashing red out of anger. He straightened up and glared daggers over at Dustin.

Tensions rose higher as my partner kicked his chair over, standing up and lording himself over Rudy. “I said you were useless!”

A frustrated hiss left Rudy’s mouth. “I’m trying my best here!”

“Well your best isn’t good enough.”

“Yeah, well you stink!” Rudy yelled, pinching his nose for dramatic effect, “Take a shower!

“Why don’t you look in a mirror, little shit,” Dustin retorted, “ya look like crap!”

Once the insults had entered childish territory, I took that as our cue to leave.

“Let’s all take some time to cool down?” I suggested, wrangling control of the situation with an imaginary lasso. “Obviously this is getting us nowhere.”

After ensuring Rudy would get a proper meal before the precinct released him, I left the interrogation room, harshly dragging Dustin out behind me.

“What is wrong with you?” I questioned, feeling strange. The roles had reversed. Not long ago it was me he was dragging out of an interrogation room. “You’re supposed to be the one that keeps his cool and I’m the hot headed newbie that has something to prove!”

“I know, I know. I’m sorry!” Dustin put his hands up defensively, leaning against the wall. “It’s just that he’s no help… and his face is stupid looking.”

“*Really?*”

Dustin blew a stray strand of auburn hair out of his face and crossed his arms into his chest.

“Why don’t we do some point shooting and let loose some steam, huh?” I said, lightly kicking his foot. “We can take our frustrations out at the range.”

Detective Davidson let out a huff and turned to face me. “Okay,” he moped.

***

I’d had my suspicions before, but I knew something was really wrong with Dustin after he emptied his third clip into a target and hit within the nine and ten circles with almost perfect accuracy.

It’s honestly a miracle the man had passed the detective’s exam with how notoriously bad of a marksman he was. This is the same guy that landed a fluke shot in a siren with a harpoon gun we’re talking about here.

While Dustin’s mood had considerably improved with his high scores, mine had stooped even lower. Emptying a clip into my target revealed felt good for one second before I saw that I had nothing on Dustin’s new and improved aim.

My head buzzed as an internal alarm sounded. My suspicions reached an all time high.

“Okay, I think you murdered enough bad guys for one day,” I said, gently patting Dustin’s shoulder from behind.

“Feels good though,” He chuckled, turning the safety back on his gun. “Thats the best I’ve done, like ever!”

“I bet,” I answered as a test slowly formed in my mind. “Why don’t you keep the lucky streak going and take a stab with the crossbows?”

“Luck? This is pure skill!” Dustin said confidently, walking over to the archery section of the range, picking a crossbow out of a locker and analyzing it.

I couldn’t help but scoff.

“Okay, fine,” he said grabbing a sharpened stake out of a barrel sitting in between two targets. He picked one and readied his aim, while I watched from the background. “I guess it’s because you’re here, Lucky. You’re my lucky charm!”

Dustin steadied the weapon in his hand as he focused on the prize- landing a bullseye. A deep breath left his mouth as he increased pressure on the trigger.  With the press of a button, the stake flew across the air, landing dead center in the little red circle.

“See? Lucky charm!”

While maintaining my composure on the outside, I happily cheered, losing my shit on the inside. The shot had all but cemented my theory: that Dustin had been bitten by a werewolf.

But, he said he hadn’t when asked.

No. He *would’ve* said something. Surely, he would’ve said something. He would’ve confided in me… right?

Denial is a river in Egypt. And I think I’ve been sailing on it ever since that night. To get off, I had to find out the truth.

I excused myself in order to make a phone call, leaving the indoor shooting range while Dustin continued target practice. A large window was built into the wall allowing passerby’s to observe that particular portion of the range. This spot was optimal for recon. He couldn’t see me, but I could spy on him and watch as  Dustin landed bullseye after bullseye.

Proof. The healed wounds, mood swings, and the improved shooting accuracy were all circumstantial. Proof was what I needed if I was about to confront Dustin.

My only hope at that point was getting information from the hospital. Since HIPPA laws were a thing, that’s wasn’t going to be easy. Good thing I could be crafty when need be.

An impossibly long hold time later, I finally got to speak to a hospital representative. After announcing myself as Dustin Davidson’s partner (which was technically true) and rattling off his DOB and social security number, I learned some *interesting* information.

Dustin had lied, and if he lied about this, what else had he lied about?

During my call he’d left the shooting range, apparently getting his fill, leaving through the back door which only led to the locker rooms.

I steadied myself, making my way over there. Preparing myself for all the possible nuclear fall out scenarios that could occur.

1) Dustin wasn’t a newly turned supernatural, and miraculously gained the ability to sharp shoot perfectly. He gets so upset and butt hurt that I didn’t trust his word that he disowns me as a partner, quits the division, and becomes a hermit in the woods.

2) He really was turned into a werewolf and he eats me.

Yeah, not liking these options much.

“Why did you lie?” I yelled, bursting into the men’s locker room angrily.

Dustin had been in the middle of changing shirts. “What are you talking about?” He asked, not making any effort to cover himself up. He didn’t even seem bothered that I- a woman- was in the men’s room where he was sweaty and shirtless.

“When you were discharged. You did it against the doctor’s orders, he even recommended you don’t come back to work for a while despite how fast you seemed to be healing, so, *why?*”

“How did you-“

I cut him off. He didn’t get to speak. “Because if you stayed any longer you ran the risk of some finding out what you were hiding? What were you hiding, Dustin?

He tossed his bundled up shirt on the bench behind him. He clenched his fists. “Lucky…” he warned. Obviously I’d struck a nerve.

I pressed down on it more. “You got bit didn’t you? That night, Noah bit you!”

“Damn it, Lucky!” He shouted, punching his fist into a random locker. A gasp left my mouth after he left a deep indent in the metal.

“Oh my god. D-Dustin- how did I not see this before?”

“Because I’m the detective, not you,” he laughed, eyes going dark. A mischievous smirk appeared on his lips as he stalked closer towards me, cornering me in between a bench and wall of baby blue painted lockers.

“Lucky,”he said breathlessly, placing both hands right above my head on the wall.

My body started shaking as I shrunk myself down, cowering before the massive man before me. This was the first time Dustin had ever seemed dangerous to me.

My cheek turned in disgust as his thumb grazed the skin. Not liking that, he grabbed my chin and forced me to look up at him. “Dustin, *no.*”

“Lucy, yes\~” he slowly lowered himself down to eye level… firmly pressing his lips into mine, stealing a kiss.

Any and all possible feeling I had for Dustin were squandered in that moment.

A tear slid down the side of my face as I found the strength to push him back.

My hands covered my mouth after a shaky gasp emerged. Dustin’s eyes had begun glowing a deep shade of blue. He chuffed, revealing that his teeth had started to sharpen into fangs. Patches of red fur sprouted in random spots all over his skin.

He was turning.

With a thud, he pushed himself back on top of me, warm breath filling my ear as he whispered, “I-it, it hurts. It hurts how much I need you!”

With a pained groan, I pushed him again.

He tripped over the bench, falling on his back. This seemed to knock him out of whatever trance he’d been in.  His eyes stopped glowing. “Please…” he pleaded, “I can’t control it!”

Salty tears streamed down my face as my hands covered my mouth and nose. I stifled  a sob as I watched my partner jerk in pain.

He slipped back into a trance, eyes burning bright when he let out a terrifying roar. He picked himself up and swiped at me. I managed to roll out of the way just in time.

Dustin attempted to lunge at me again, growling something fierce, but suddenly stopped in his tracks. His face strained as he attempted to move but stayed still.

My brows furrowed in confusion.
