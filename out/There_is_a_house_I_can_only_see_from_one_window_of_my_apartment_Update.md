It’s been around two months since my last post and I have some news to share. I followed your advice from the last post and I got myself some glass cutting tools and made a hole in my window. I started with a small one to check whether the glass or the window was the problem. It’s the window. As much as I liked the idea of “They live” glasses and the possibility to go see the house up close, that fell through. However, I could still see the house through the hole I made. So I spent a few days experimenting. I put a few things inside the hole, I started with some old candles that someone gave me for Christmas so they could finally be useful. The candles fell on the other side of the window and I could see them through it. When I went to pick them up from the balcony, they were nowhere to be found. I tried to put something where the candles were supposed to be and when I went to check through the window, the candles had been moved out of the way. I tried from the other side of the window and I got the same result, it appears that the window works both ways. I looked for something “alive” so I could see if it affected it differently. My final choice was some old potatoes that had started growing. I put them in the hole and waited to see if anything weird was happening to them.  
   
Over the next few days, I used my binoculars to see how the house was evolving. I counted 12 branches that grew from the trunk. About half of those were still growing, including the one growing toward me. There is something fascinating about watching that tree grow. I can always notice when a branch got bigger but it’s sometimes a challenge to find where the new floor appeared. To take my mind off things, I made it into a game. The rules are simple, find the new floor before another one appears. I manage to win about half the time. I only play for my own satisfaction of course but it does feel nice when I succeed. It’s like I understand what is happening, even if I really don’t. 

After a week, the potatoes grew as expected. If I waited longer, I might have a second eldritch abomination on my hands, albeit not a dangerous one. It gave me enough confidence to do my next experiment. A prudent man might have done more testing but every ounce of prudence that I had was slowly eroded by the architectural horror that was coming for me. I selected which of my fingers I liked the least and put it through the hole. I was both surprised and not surprised that nothing happened. I put my hand through and waved it around, still nothing. It was almost boring. So I made the hole bigger, just big enough to crawl through, and prepared myself to get in. I went legs first, just in case.  
   
The first thing I noticed was the stillness of the air. There was no wind, no noise apart from my own. Everything felt muffled, dense. My eyes felt uncomfortable, like when you go from a dark place to a bright one. My vision was kind of blurry, it scared me enough that I went back to my apartment. As soon as I did, everything went back to normal. At first, I decided not to do it again but I couldn’t resist, I was back on the other side the next day. This time I kept my cool and noticed that not everything was blurry. Only moving things were. Every car, every animal, every person I could see was blurry. I rubbed my eyes a few times and less than a minute later, all of those blurry things simply disappeared. The world was completely still, no wind, no sound, no smell, not a single moving thing. I went back and looked through the other windows, I was happy to see a few people moving around. When I looked through that window, they were blurry for a while until my eyes went back to normal. I didn’t understand how that worked but it somehow comforted me. If I was going to explore, at least the chances of meeting some kind of other world entity were low.  
   
I didn’t have an explanation for the changes in my vision when I went to the other but at least it didn’t seem to have lasting effect so nothing was stopping me from exploring. I quickly discovered the second thing, I couldn’t move anything on the other side. No matter how hard I pushed, pulled or hit, even the smallest pebble wouldn’t move. The only exception was the things I brought through the window with me. I managed to get inside my apartment by going through the window from the balcony side but I couldn’t explore much. A door needs to be firmly secured open to actually be open on the other side. I did manage to take a look in the hallway by opening my own door but decided against going out. If anything happened and the door closed, I would have no way to get back to my apartment, the risk was too high. I considered getting some equipment to climb down from the balcony. I never went rock climbing so I have no idea how difficult that would be, no way I can do it safely without some training.  
   
All of these new discoveries and experiments kept me occupied enough to stop thinking about the branch growing towards me. I’m not sure why I didn’t notice that it grew faster. Maybe I did and just didn’t want to accept it, keeping my focus on other things I could actually control. It’s not like I could have done anything. And then, one morning, it finally happened. There it was, slightly swaying, starting just where the balcony was ending. The tree had reached me. And I was now facing what I feared the most. Not the building itself but the door that was on it.  
   
How could I resist? No matter how I thought about it, it was a bad idea. Nothing in there would be worth it. Everything from logic to instinct told me I should just leave it alone. But I still couldn’t resist. The door might not open, after all none of the doors on the other side did. Then I would be fine, I wouldn’t be tempted anymore. Either way, the choice would be made for me.  
   
I reached the handle with apprehension, not sure of what I wanted to happen. It opened. The room was empty, covered floor to ceiling in wooden floorboards. The only source of light was a single naked lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. If I had seen that room in someone's basement, that would be the reddest of flags but, in an endlessly growing house from a hidden side of the world, the creepiness was par for the course. I mean, with that many rooms, you are going to have some weird ones. I crossed the room and opened the door on the other side. The next room was a lot more normal. Red carpet on the floors and stripped wallpaper, a few armchairs were around a coffee table in the middle of the room. Pretty cozy, all in all. I decided to stop my first exploration there. I went back to my apartment, went shopping and prepared everything I might need. Food and water mostly. I found a checklist for urban exploration and packed everything I had. Flashlight, makeshift first aid kit, gloves and tough clothes. I considered taking weapons and decided on a heavy wrench. I didn’t expect to meet anything but carrying something might make me feel safer.  
   
For my second day of exploration, my plan was to follow the branch to the “trunk” and decide where to go from there. I went back in and quickly went through the familiar rooms I saw the day before. I went from room to room smoothly, only a few had furniture so I usually didn’t even stop. Each room was different, the only thing in common was that they all had two doors and no windows. Some were completely normal, the kind of room they have on a furniture store website. They were the perfect image of a living room, bedroom or kitchen. Some were slightly strange, like the first room was. Carpets on the wall with painted floors, like walls and floors had been exchanged. Completely barren concrete room. One had a carpeted floor so deep it almost reached my knees. And finally some I can only describe as weird, they made me uncomfortable. Luckily there were only a few. One was filled with wardrobes, leaving only a tight space to move around. The room was closer to the trunk so rooms were bigger. There were probably a hundred different ones, some in neat rows, some on a pile in a corner of the room. Another weird room was apparently a shower room, there was a metal pole with 4 shower heads in the middle. The rest of the room was covered in white tiles with some drains at regular intervals, including on the walls. What really made me uncomfortable were the armchairs circling the room, all facing the shower heads. It feels like that’s the kind of shower that would make you feel dirty.  
   
I reached the trunk around lunch time. The room was by far the largest I had been in so far. It was a mess of stairs, some leading to doors, others leading nowhere. There was basically no flat space in the whole room. I stayed there for a bit, having a snack while thinking about my next step. I had two objectives. First, go up and see if I could figure out how the house was growing. Second, go down and check the original floors for a clue on how it started and possibly go out through the front door. I opted to go up first, I was more interested in stopping the growth if possible. I could get used to a giant tree house view if it stopped changing everyday.  
   
I went up through the spiral staircase in the middle of the room as it looked like the way up the trunk. Having to climb up made my progress a lot slower than before. There was always a path up but since every room was different the difficulty was changing. It ranged from rooms being basically a single staircase going to the next floor to an empty room with a ladder in the middle. Luckily that one was lower than the rest. Sometimes rooms had a door on the side leading to what I guessed were one of the growing branches of the tree. I noticed a  strange thing with the lights that I didn’t see in the branch coming from my apartment. It wasn’t at regular intervals but it happened often enough that it was noticeable. The lights were getting brighter at times. There was a logic to it, it went from the lowest to the highest lamp. My theory was that it was a trail of the energy used to grow the house. It almost made me want to go down and check the source of it first but I felt it was a waste to have climbed this far up and not reach the top.  
   
I was surprised when I did. I had no way to know how high I was so when I opened the trapdoor to what I thought was the next floor and felt the sun on my face, it took me a moment to realize I actually made it. The rooftop was a smooth dome with nothing to stop me if I were to slip so I stayed in the middle close to the trapdoor. I was thankful for the stillness of the air now, as the lack of wind made me feel safer. Not safe enough to risk moving around but safe enough to take a look. My apartment looked so small from up there, I would have had some trouble finding it if not for the branch going to it. I turned my attention to the rest of the view. By my estimation, I was around 60 stories up, far higher than any other building around, so I could see far more things than from my apartment. Those were familiar sights, just from a different angle. The first strange thing I noticed was in the business center. Among the tall skyscrapers, I saw an unfamiliar shape. I took out my binoculars and took a closer look. The best way I can describe it would be octopus tentacles made of skyscrapers, snaking around the other buildings. It wasn’t a tree like the building I was in, it was more animalistic, it felt more alive. The new information hit me like a brick, there was so much I didn’t know. It made me realize how little I actually knew, I just sat down thinking about everything that happened. It was only when the sunset started that I finally came back to my senses.

  
I went back in through the trapdoor and noticed that the room was very hot and the light was particularly bright. It was pulsating. I wanted to study it more but the day of going up had left me exhausted. A room a few floors down was a bedroom that looked pretty comfortable and I remembered thinking it would be easy to block all entrances by moving furniture. So that’s what I did, I got ready for the night. I slept relatively well, considering the situation. The bed was unbelievably comfortable which helped a lot. It was strange sleeping somewhere with absolutely no sounds apart from the ones I was making. Not as strange as sleeping in a tree building from a hidden part of the world but I tried not to think about that part. I was so tired that I still fell asleep quickly despite all the weirdness. I woke up well rested the next, although my legs were pretty sore from all the walking.  
   
I thought about my plan the night before. First I wanted to see if I could see more structures from the rooftop. I went back up to the trapdoor I used the day before and opened it. Instead of sunlight, I was welcomed by an expensive looking dining room. It looked like a new room appeared during the night. I located a staircase on the other side of the room and opened the door at the end of it. The door opened but barely. I could hear the door hit something hard when I pushed and tried my best to at least crack it open to see but nothing worked. Disappointed by the start of the day, I focused back to my other objective. I went down.  
   
The way down was a lot easier, it didn’t take me long to get back to the hub where my journey up began and started exploring new territories. I was getting used to the changing by then and only slowed down for some particularly unexpected rooms. The most notable had mirrors on all sides which gave it a weird endless effect. It had dark purple lighting which really reinforced the otherworldly feeling. I think the reason it bothered me so much was my reflection. Not that there was anything weird with it, but by then I hadn’t seen another person for almost two days and that was if I count seeing people from my balcony. It made me realize how obsessed I was and how much it isolated me. I definitely needed to get out and meet some friends as soon as I was done exploring.  
   
I continued my journey down until I finally saw sunlight again. I had reached the house that started it all. It wasn’t that much different from what I saw from the outside. It was dusty, the sunshine coming from the window illuminating the dust clouds following my every movement. All the furniture was covered with sheets, the house hadn’t been lived in for a long time. The first thing I tried was the front door which moved enough to show that it was locked. I might be able to get it open if I could learn how to pick locks. Or maybe the keys might be somewhere. So I started checking every inch of the house. I would probably have done it anyway but now I was actually looking for something specific. Unluckily there wasn’t any trace of the key anywhere. More precisely there wasn’t any kind of usable object in the whole house. I checked every drawer, every shelf, every box, and I found absolutely nothing. The only thing I found was a staircase in the basement. It was different from the ones I had seen on my way down. There were all different styles and materials but they all appeared to have been built there. These stairs were carved in the stone, going deep into the earth itself. It made sense in a way, every tree had roots. As I was thinking about my next step, the lights started pulsating again, coming from down there. Whatever was happening, at least some answers were that way.  
   
The day started getting dark before I made the first step down the stone stairs so I decided to stay in the house for the night. I collected some of the sheets covering the furniture to make a reasonably comfortable place to sleep in a small room and pushed a wardrobe to block the door. As this was my second night in the house, I was more relaxed than the day before, I fell asleep almost right away. I was woken up in the middle of the night by a noise. The first noise I heard since I went through the window. It sounded like someone breathing with a strange rhythm. There were four inhales, each one longer than the last, followed by a long exhale. I went closer to the door to hear better but it stopped before I could wake up enough to realize what it was. I stayed there for a while, unsuccessfully trying to hear something, before I decided to get back to my makeshift bed. I lied down as quietly as I could, focusing on the sounds. I fell asleep without noticing and was only woken up by the rising sun. I was still tense about the noises from the night so I didn’t move my blockade before I was absolutely sure there was nothing out of the room. When I was finally out, I checked for traces of anything. The only tracks I found were my own footprints in the dust. Maybe my own mind had played a trick on me. I was still half asleep when I heard the noises so I might have been dreaming. The other possibility was too hard to accept.  
   
I considered going back home, after all I had been exploring for over two days by then. My curiosity, or more accurately my obsession, got the better of me and I decided to keep going down. The root system was a lot different from what I was used to. Instead of a series of rooms, there were only branching stairs with a few closets here and there. I had trouble finding my way. It was a maze with paths going up and down. I was often met with branching paths with no indication of the correct way to go. I first tried to go down as much as possible but it mostly ended in dead-ends or stairs going back up. It took me a few hours to realize I would need a strategy to get somewhere. I decided to follow the pulsing lights, they were rare and it made me wait at crossroads for a long time more than once but it finally looked like I was getting somewhere. The cold stone walls started getting warmer. I was excited to finally find something and started going as fast as my legs could safely take me. Reaching the end of the stairs, I found myself in a large cavern. I might have examined it more in detail to figure out if it was natural or carved like the stairs were but all my attention was swallowed by the structure in the middle of the cavern. Completely out of place in this place stood a house. It was the house, the one from the normal world.  
   
The house felt familiar yet oddly foreign. I went to open the door like I did the first time but this time it opened. I was excited, this had to be the source. Maybe I was going to finally find answers and not more questions. I went in quietly and was surprised to see that the entire house only had one single room. From the inside, I could see that all walls and floors were made of metal sheets welded together. The room was almost empty apart from a row of metal chests on one side and a large furnace in the middle of the room. The furnace was cold enough to get close to it but the scorch marks all around it were a sign that it wasn’t always the case. It looked like it was made from scrap metal, a patchwork of parts put together into something that was created for pure function, without care for aesthetics. I tried to get closer to it to see what it was burning but the heat that came from it made it obvious that it was a bad idea. It made me smile that some things still felt like bad ideas, I still had a little bit of common sense left. The most surprising thing about the furnace is that nothing seemed to be connected to it. I went around it and I saw no pipes or anything that would indicate what it was used for.  
   
Puzzled by the machine, my attention turned to the chests. Each of them was made of scrap metal like the furnace. They varied in size and shape. I opened the first one and found clothes. They were dirty and worn but folded neatly in one corner of the chest. I dug around in the pockets but didn’t find anything of note. I checked the next chest and this time the clothes were more fashionable and expensive looking. A small purse was also in the box, in which I found the ID of a young woman. Not wanting to leave too many tracks, I took a picture of it and put everything back the way it was. The rest of the chests were more of the same. Of the seven chests, only three of them had IDs. My thoughts at the time were that each chest contained the belongings of a person. I was curious about why the chests were so much bigger than their contents. The last chest provided a grim clue to answer that. When I opened it, I wasn’t surprised to see the clothes on my side. I was surprised by what I quickly identified as a human leg and human arm. Something looked off about them so it didn’t scare me right away. At the end of each member, instead of a cut and open wound like you would expect, was a cleanly healed stump. A stump implies that the cut was treated and healed. This would be impossible on a cut member, only the body would heal. Logically, they could not be real. So I touched the arm. And I felt it grow goosebumps as my finger touched it.  
   
I closed the chest and went to the door as fast as I could. As I reached for the door handle, I heard the breathing from the night before. Four inhale, one exhale. I ran the other way. I had seen a door on the other side as I was exploring so I aimed for that. A few seconds later, I heard the door behind me slam open and something moving behind me. I didn’t turn back, I didn’t want to.I didn’t understand the noises it was making, I still can’t. All I knew is that it was getting closer. As soon as I reached the door, I went through and tried to close it behind me. Something was in the way. 

At first, I thought they were worms. Four big worms flopping around after I closed the door on them. But they were not worms, worms don’t have nails. They were impossibly long fingers, not with only three sections like most of you have. But over twenty even for the shortest one, and that is just for the part on my side on the door. I tried my best to keep the door closed, the fingers reached my shoulder, pushing me away from the door with surprising strength. I reached for my wrench and swatted at them. All of them rolled into a ball, in what looked like a defensive position. Having won some precious time, I pushed my wrench into the soft floor to act as a doorstop. I turned and saw three stairways going up, I picked the closest one and kept running as fast as I could. I was still hearing that thing, breathing louder and louder. I don’t know how long I ran but as I got tired, I slipped and fell. Luckily I wasn’t far from a small closet on the side of the stairs and got in. That was the best choice, I didn’t realize right away but I had broken my ankle. I used everything I hadn’t lost yet to block the door.  
   
It took a while for me to start feeling the pain in my ankle, I was full of adrenaline and the sound of breathing coming from the other side kept it high. I stayed silent, unmoving for as long as I could. After a while, the breathing went away. I waited longer to make sure but it came back. So I kept waiting. Everytime the breathing stopped, I hoped that it wouldn’t come back but it always did. By my estimation, I stayed in that closet for over a week. Strangely, my ankle stopped hurting after a few days. It healed perfectly, it’s even more flexible than my other one now. I can bend my foot almost all the way back. I ran out of water after a week, so with my only other option being to die of thirst in a closet underground, I took a chance and got out. I moved quietly, saving my strength in case I needed to run, and followed the pulsating lights back up. My journey back was uneventful. I didn’t stop to rest so I was exhausted when I came back home. I barricaded the hole in my window as much as I could and went to sleep.  
   
I spent the next few days reinforcing the blockade on the window and writing this post. I checked the names from the IDs I found in the chests and they are all missing persons. I don’t intend to go back there ever again. It’s going to take a while for me to go back to normal, just looking at the metal plate I put where the window was makes me tense every muscle in my body. I have nightmares about my experience. I am just hoping it goes away, not sure I can handle it if it gets worse. Like this morning when I got up, I couldn’t open the door to my bedroom. And when I tried harder, I swear I heard something breathing. Four inhales, one exhale. Everything went back to normal soon after. But it’s just because I was still asleep, right ?
