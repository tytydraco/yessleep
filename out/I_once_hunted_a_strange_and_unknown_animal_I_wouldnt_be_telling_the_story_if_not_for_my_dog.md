Such beauty. Yes, I know, I was just a hunter, yet, I always found myself in complete awe in front of nature. Sometimes, I could forget the hunting to focus on the exploring, after all, I was living near a forest that fueled my curiosity. The fresh air, the flora, the greenery and the forest sounds — which I like to call the nature's song — constituted a small part of the many things I loved about our dear planet. One day however, the exploration went too far and dire consequences followed.

It was two years ago on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. My dog Mace, a weimaraner, and myself followed the trail of an elusive deer fawn that kept on escaping us since noon. Its behavior seemed unnatural, as if it toyed with us and wanted us to understand that we could catch it. This in return fueled my resolve, with an anger that reached new heights at each of its escapes. Sunset was fast approaching when Mace suddenly dashed in a direction that was off the deer fawn's trail, but I quickly followed, trusting my dog's sharp instincts. A mix of disappointment, surprise and panic overwhelmed me when I set my eyes on the strange scenery. Mace fed on something fleshy that seemed carefully placed in front of an occult altar covered with bizarre symbols representing diverse animals. I sensed danger.

Out of a nearby bush, the deer fawn emerged and I swiftly hid behind a tree, determined to seize the opportunity of ending this once for all. I peeked, clenching my rifle, ready to strike at the right moment. The deer ignored Mace, walked behind the altar and disappeared for a few seconds, but my eyes almost popped out of the sockets when I saw a tiger cub emerge from the other side. Either to protect Mace or to uncover the mystery behind all that, I immediately shot the tiger cub, knowing that they are born blind and depend on adult tigers for protection. The cub just slumped and Mace seemed to regain his senses as he lift his head up. I approached and saw the tiger lying on the ground unconscious and the altar mysteriously glowing in red. 

Something ominous seemed to come our way due to the bizarre encounter, so I rapidly put the cub in a game bag and left the place before something else happened. Long was the walk home after hunting so deep in the forest, but we arrived at my brick cabin during the evening without any issues. A false sense of insecurity that preceeded the tsunami of terror awaiting for us in the dark hours. I put the game bag on a table, ready to have a little rest after almost a whole day of hunting when suddenly:

"Spen—cer." I heard, coming from the bag. The faint, agonizing voice of a female human being. "Spencer, Spen—cer." I could not believe my ears. 

I crept towards the bag, ignoring the dread and opened it. I almost fell backwards when I saw that the tiger cub had transformed into a snake, agonizing on my table and calling my name. 

"You— not staying— alive." It said, before it— laughed, as disturbing as it may seem. 

Mace started barking at something lurking in the shadows outside. I went to a window and peeked to see many animals, from bears to packs of wolves, roaming around the cabin. I retrieved my rifle when I heard other beasts making their way on the cabin's roof until the thing on the table captured my attention once again. 

"Spencer." It called and I looked at it, then speaking to me as the deer fawn. 

"What's this? What are you?" I questioned, aiming at the entity, but Mace jumped in front of it, growling at me, something he never did. 

"I know— what you did— during the war." The entity said as I lowered my rifle in disbelief. "You must— pay." It added. 

At that instant, I heard a heavy beast charging towards the cabin while I trembled, waiting for the animal to just bring the habitat down. The beast hit the wall and shook the entire cabin, before I heard it retreating to prepare for its next attack. All the other beasts outside started making their respective and distinctive noises. It seemed that the whole fauna of the forest came after me for a deadly showdown. 

"What do you want? WHAT DO YOU WANT?" I asked. 

"Whukeleto already— bargained with me." The entity responded as the heavy strong beast hit the wall for a second time, making an enormous crack on it. 

"Who?" I asked. 

"Dog." The entity replied. 

"Mace?" I spoke, perplexed. 

"Mace— not his true— name." The entity said as the beast finally tore through the wall, revealing itself to be a bear and in one swift movement knocked me out.

The next morning, Mace woke me up and I saw the hole on the wall, a testimony of the previous day strange and terrifying events. Glad that both of us were still alive, I packed up and left, with the intention of never returning to such a quiet life. I took the direction of a big and busy city, hoping that it will help me escape from the past, but little did I know that [Mace](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10aum5h/i_will_never_own_a_pet_again/) carried a fragment of the supernatural encounter with him.
