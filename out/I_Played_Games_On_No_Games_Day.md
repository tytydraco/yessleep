I needed to put this somewhere online, for nobody I’ve ever spoken to about that day seems to recall a single event. And I assure you, reader, that all of this happened without a doubt in my mind. But everyone doubts me! So if even one person can relate to anything I’m about to write about that day, I beg of you to say something! It’ll calm my scattered mind.

The day was February 29, 2020. And besides the date, and the spreading threat of the coronavirus, you’d assume it to be a regular day. The sun shone bright across the gray winter sky, birds were singing, and the wind rushed steadily between trees. I was making my way through a local trail, roughly thirty minutes away from home. It cut through woods and large open fields, making for a decently long walk before looping back to my car.

I encountered but a single oddity whilst traversing through the forest. It was after the path split, leading to a rickety old bridge. Built to safely cross a rushing stream, the bridge lived exactly to expectation. And almost fell apart. That was not the weird part! Within the path of the stream rested a large, disk-shaped hunk of metal. It reflected light as would a mirror, and I could see my face within. After crossing the bridge, I figured that it was only reasonable to try and get a closer look. But that was about all. It didn’t seem damaged in any way, and so I figured the object was left behind by somebody else. Or perhaps it had to be there for an important reason. Either way, I really didn’t think much of it.

The air was fresh and cool, and the forest’s scent was pleasant. I continued my walk and passed an open field with a great view of the Atlantic, crossing through a section of thick greenery until reaching for my keys, unlocking the car door. It was quiet. And the hum of the engine was singularly masking said silence.

The drive was long due to traffic; an accident had occurred on the highway. Again, I thought nothing of it. Figured it was just bad luck, that’s all. And so I continued on, pressing upon the accelerator, then upon the brakes, a never ending cycle, until I finally passed the bottleneck. I drove a little under the speed limit and made it home.

Taking off my coat, I placed it upon the back of a chair. My place is comfy, and I don’t usually have company over, and the neighbors in the next-door apartments are usually pretty quiet. The area is fairly rural too, making it convenient to walk anywhere important. 

After cleaning up a bit, the sun started to set, and the sky grew into a dark, calming red. And after stepping outside and watching it cross the horizon, I thought about much of the past and of the many intricacies of everyday life, enthralled completely in thought. I eventually stepped back inside, meandering my way over to the couch. Of course I would choose to play games for the rest of the night! as there is not a better way to pass the time.

It was around eight-thirty when the building started to shake. And a glow flashed outside the blinds, casting light rays through suspended dust. Soon it stopped, but I was shocked, and paused everything I was doing, and stepped outside to investigate. Everything seemed natural. I know I hadn’t imagined it! Pacing up and down the street, a single street lamp was lit, shining through a layer of fog. The wind howled. 

It was nine thirty when I dragged myself back inside. In itself, that was hard for me to do. The world felt as though it was rotating around me. It was impossible to concentrate.

Then static echoed from the television, and snow covered the screen. Over time it grew louder. My ears bled. In a flash of bright red, I was somewhere else entirely; patterns covered the steel surroundings, emitting crimson light. My arms were being held, and as much as I tried, I couldn’t scream. A sticky substance was soaked into my clothing. They towered above, speaking in their own dialect. Their appearance for which I cannot describe, was horrid and near-incomprehensible.

Soon they spoke English, in a scratchy, deep voice: “Calm down. We need to know why you interact with such devices. Think about the answer. We can read your thoughts.”

It hadn’t crossed my mind what those things could be referring to. They held me tighter, shining lights into my eyes, in all sorts of colors.

“Why? Tell us. We need to know to further understand!”

Then it clicked! “I play them to pass the time, as some sort of distraction,” I thought.

There was a long pause. “Very well,” echoed the voice. “That’s all we need to know. And there's others we need to ask the same!”

Pain surged through my veins. I saw many glimpses and hues indescribable to man. There were places seen that may or may not be real. The screeching was deafening. There was one last thing I heard through the ringing:

“Useless, useless! Such an unproductive activity. How could they experience joy from such a thing?” The voice trailed off, and continued in another dialect.

Everything went black. For a while, my senses ceased to function. Everything was void. Then I saw stars, and a collection of color and beauty. The nebulas erupted with vibrancy. And for a bit, all was calm. I can only imagine the things they did to me whilst I was asleep. I’ve never felt the same ever since. 

When I woke, I assumed it all to be a dream. Because surely such bizarreness is only possible within a dreamscape! I opened my eyes. The sun creeped through the windows. All was silent, besides the chirping birds. I felt oddly energized, yet I ceased to move. I didn't know what to think. But when I finally decided to regain myself, I noticed a horrid scent, and sat up. It was me who reeked of vile! And my clothes felt awfully stiff!

No matter what I say, no soul I express to has believed a word. So am I insane? Somebody out there *has* to be able to recall something similar, somebody! Please reach out. As I wrote before, it would greatly ease my thoughts, and I shall live with eased discomfort regarding that day. Just to know that I hadn’t been alone! Thanks, reader. Truly, thank you. And spread the word!
