The atmosphere in the car is thick with unsaid words. The streets of New Orleans roll past, the warm glow of the midday sun punctuating the colonial architecture and lively marketplaces. It’s a mild day in late January, the kind that makes you believe spring is just around the corner even when it's months away.

As a private eye, I welcome a day off like this. No cases, no mysteries. Just a simple drive to my parents' house for Tết. But as every investigator knows, there’s no such thing as a simple drive.

The text I received earlier in the day still looms over me. "We need to talk." That's all the message says. No follow-up text, no response to my requests for elaboration. Nothing good ever starts with those four words.

Sitting next to me, Reine, my wife and crime-solving partner, nervously checks herself in the sun visor mirror for what seems like the hundredth time. Her brunette locks cascade down her back in soft waves, contrasting with her porcelain skin. Her gray eyes, deep and enigmatic, dart from the mirror to the scenery outside and back again. Her red lips purse in anxiety.

After a decade of marriage, you'd think she'd be accustomed to these visits. Yet she looks more terrified now than she did facing the [Beast](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1581vef/our_search_for_a_missing_teen_uncovered_the/) of the Bayou last summer.

"Can you give it a rest? You look fine," I snap, more harshly than I intend to.

Reine's eyes lock onto mine, a tempest in her gaze. "Excuse me?"

"I mean, you look amazing, Reine,” I say sheepishly, softening my tone.

Reine pulls at her dress, her eyes returning to her reflection. "Do I look… fat in this?"

Trying to lighten the mood, I quip, “Em, if you were any thinner, you'd be invisible.”

Reine's eyes narrow. She doesn't look pleased. I immediately regret my attempt at humor.

"I just want to make a good impression, you know?" she murmurs.

I glance over at her, my grip tightening on the wheel. "Reine, they’ve seen you hundreds of times. If you haven't made an impression by now, maybe you never will."

She shoots me a glare, "You know it's not that simple. It's just... they look at me and I still feel like an outsider. You know how much I want them to like me.”

"They do like you, they love you," I reply. "Besides, It's just dinner."

She stiffens. "It's not 'just dinner' to me, Ash. It never has been. And you know it."

Letting out a deep sigh, I can't contain my frustration. "Why does everything have to be a drama with you?"

Her eyes flash with anger. "You're blaming me? Just because I care about how I'm perceived?"

"That's not the point. This...this excessive self-consciousness, it’s becoming a problem." I glance at her, regretting my words even before they land.

Reine's eyes turn glassy, a mixture of hurt and anger. "Excessive self-consciousness? Really, Ash? Maybe if you'd been a bit more 'self-conscious' during that recent case, things would've turned out differently."

I raise an eyebrow, struggling to keep my voice level. "You're bringing up the Daniels case? That's what this is about?"

Her nostrils flare, her frustration evident. "You know it's not just about the case. But since we're on the topic, maybe if you weren't so self-absorbed in your ‘methods’, you'd have seen the signs."

I scoff, "What signs? That I was following my instincts as I always do?"

"Exactly!" Reine exclaims, pointing a finger at me. "Your instincts! Not once did you think about how your actions could affect others. Like when you decided to break into Daniels' office without backup."

I snort. "This is rich coming from you of all people, Reine," I say tersely. "Between the two of us, you’ve always been the reckless one. Remember the stunt you pulled last year on the Montgomery case? You almost got us both killed."

Reine’s voice lowers, her anger dissolving into vulnerability. "Ash, I’m just saying… maybe we both need to think more about... about consequences, about the future... about...”

As the SUV pulls up to a quaint apartment complex, the vibrant figure of our secretary Abby appears at the door. Her eyes widen slightly at the sight of the vehicle, and she hurriedly makes her way, carrying a carefully wrapped dish.

I can see something deeper in Reine's eyes, a tremble in her voice, something she’s hesitating to say. But my own frustration blinds me to her subtle attempt to change the conversation's direction. The apartment complex looms larger as we pull into the parking lot, and the sight of Abby, hurrying toward us distracts me further.

"Can we please talk about this later?" I beg her, not wanting to cause a scene.

Her mouth tightens, and she gives a small, reluctant nod, looking down at her lap. "Fine," she whispers, the unspoken words hanging heavy in the air between us.

"Hey, y’all," she greets cheerily as she gets in, unaware of the stormy atmosphere in the front. “Thanks again for inviting me. I’m so excited!”

As she settles into the seat, she can't help but notice the icy silence. "Everything okay?" she asks, her voice hesitant.

Reine and I trip over each [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGd1F6Ay8ho) to respond.

"Everything's fine," I say.

"Absolutely," Reine adds, her tone just a tad too sweet.

Abby raises an eyebrow but decides not to push further. "So," she begins, trying to change the topic, "Tet is like Vietnamese Thanksgiving, right? Because I brought a casserole."

Reine laughs softly, "Not exactly, chère. It’s more like New Year’s. It's a time for family and to celebrate fresh starts."

Seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, I chime in with a smirk, “You know, our previous secretary made the same mistake. Brought a turkey and everything. We never saw her again after that Tet dinner. What was her name? Louise? It’s still our most mysterious [cold](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14c93t1/im_an_arctic_researcher_we_accidentally_released/) case.”

Abby’s face pales, but before she can react, Reine rolls her eyes and playfully swats at me. "Don't listen to him. He’s just messing with you. Louise moved to California to be closer to her grandkids.”

I could see the relief wash over Abby’s face.

Reine smiles at her, "If it puts your mind at ease, I made a traditional Cajun Mardi Gras dish – chicken and sausage gumbo. It's a bit spicy, but I think everyone will love it."

Abby's eyes light up, "That sounds amazing!”

Reine grins, then turns her attention back to me. "Ash, did you remember to bring the lì xì for Theo and Mia?"

Abby, looking confused, chimes in, "Li xi? What's that?"

Reine explains, "It's a Tet tradition. Elders give red envelopes with money inside to younger family members. It's meant to bring luck and prosperity for the new year."

Abby nods, understanding. "Oh, so like a new year present.”

Reine nods, then eyes me with a pointed look.

"So, Ash? Did you put in $50 for each of them?"

I sigh, rubbing my temples, "Yes, I did."

She gives me an approving smile, "Great. I just want to be a good aunt, you know? They're growing up so fast."

Abby catches on to the tension, and with a puzzled expression, she looks from me to Reine. "Fifty dollars seems generous."

I mumble, "I wanted to give them $20 each, but some people believe in spoiling them."

Reine and I lock eyes. For a moment, all the heated words and unspoken issues between us hang in the air. But as Abby looks between us, curiously, we reach an silent truce. For her sake, and for the sake of the day, we let it all slide into the background.

Rather than dredging up further drama, Reine and I spend the rest of the ride giving Abby a crash course in Vietnamese language and culture.

—

The entrance to my parents' house always brings a rush of nostalgia. The familiar scent of jasmine and the faded walls painted in a pale blue hue transport me back to a simpler time. Reine and I exchange a quick glance, our previous argument momentarily shelved. For the next few hours we are a happy couple. In my line of work, you get really good at pretending.

Stepping out of the car, the sounds of laughter and the faint murmur of voices reach our ears. It seems the entire extended family has already gathered. I straighten my jacket while Reine adjusts her dress, making sure everything is in place.

As we near the entrance, the door swings open to reveal my mother, a small, plump woman with graying hair pulled back in a tight bun. Her face lights up with a bright smile as she sees us. "Ah, Asher! Reine! You came," she exclaims, her Vietnamese accent shades her English.

My father, a tall, grizzled man with hands roughened from years in the fishing industry on the Gulf, appears behind her, a wide smile on his face. "Chào mừng!" (Welcome!) he booms, pulling me into a bear hug.

“Vui quá được gặp ba má,” (It’s good seeing you, mom and dad,) I say, the words wrap over my tongue as comfortably as a well-worn coat.

Reine steps forward with a shy smile. "Chúc Mừng Năm Mới, ba má," (Happy New Year, mom and dad,) she says, her accent thick, but her effort brings a broad smile to my mother’s face.

My mom says warmly, "Rất giỏi! Chúc Mừng Năm Mới, cưng!" (Very good! Happy New Year, dear!)

Dad comments, "Better every year. Soon, we won't know you're not Vietnamese."

My mom’s face tightens, a glare flashed at him for his potentially insensitive remark.

Reine lets out a light, good-natured laugh, brushing off the comment with grace. "One day, perhaps. But until then, I'll keep practicing."

Mom reaches up to embrace Reine warmly. She then pulls back to inspect her, eyes full of warmth.

“You look beautiful, con,” she says, using the Vietnamese word for daughter, as though to reassure her of her place in the family.

“Oh, this is Abby, by the way, our secretary at the agency,” I introduce Abby, breaking back into English. She waves shyly, a small “Chào” (Hello) escaping her lips.

While Abby distracts my parents, I slip into the living room.

I scan the room. The familiar hum of conversation and the warm amber light embrace me. Older relatives sit on one side, their conversations a flowing river of lyrical Vietnamese. Their laughter, accompanying a game of Tien Len, merges with the gentle clink of teacups.

On the other side, my younger cousins chatter excitedly in English, their eyes glued to a smartphone as they share the latest online sensation.

My gaze drifts to the walls adorned with family photographs, moments of joy and milestones frozen in time, interspersed with stern portraits of me as a Marine.

I'm drawn to the corner of the living room where the family altar stands. The soft glow of candles illuminates photographs of ancestors, their faces forever frozen in time. My eyes rest on the  picture of my bà ngoại (grandma), Kiều, the woman who helped raise me.

I take a joss stick, igniting it from the altar's candle. The fragrant smoke slowly curls upwards, filling the air with a comforting, woody aroma. It mingles seamlessly with the savory scent of my mom's cooking wafting from the kitchen.

Bowing slightly, I say a silent prayer, thanking bà ngoại for her love and guidance.

Continuing my search, I catch sight of my younger sister, Kira, in the adjoining room. She’s chasing after her two young children, a look of frantic merriment on her face. But amidst the giggles and playful shrieks of the kids, I notice the strain in her eyes, a shadow of sadness and uncertainty that she’s doing her best to hide.

The absence of Xuân, her husband, hangs in the air like a heavy, unspoken word. It’s her first Tết since their separation, and the pain is still fresh, a wound yet to heal.

Navigating my way towards Kira feels like threading through a determined defense on the football field. I sidestep Aunt Mai's eager questions and slide past Uncle Bao's boisterous stories, finally reaching Kira.

Kira’s eyes meet mine, and for a moment, the mask falls, revealing the raw vulnerability beneath. She gives me a weary but sincere smile.

"Hey, Anh Ash," Kira says, looking almost surprised to see me. She hugs me, clinging to me just a moment longer than usual, as if drawing strength from our bond.

She then turns to Reine, offering a genuine smile and hug. "Good seeing you, Chị Reine."

"It's great to see you, em," I say.

Her kids, Theo and Mia, seven and five years old, notice us, their faces lighting up with youthful excitement. “Cậu Ash! Mợ Reine!” (Uncle Ash! Aunt Reine!) they exclaim, abandoning their game to rush towards us, their small feet pattering against the wooden floor.

Reine bends down to the kids' level, feigning shock as she holds her hands out to measure their heights. "Mon Dieu, you two are getting so tall! Soon, you'll be taller than me!" she exclaims with playful exaggeration.

Theo giggles, puffing out his little chest with pride, while Mia, ever the dramatic one, stands on her tiptoes and stretches her arms skyward. "Look, Mợ Reine! I'm already so tall!"

Kira chuckles, ruffling Mia's hair. "At this rate, she might just surpass all of us."

The kids jump onto me with squeals of delight, wrapping their little arms around me tightly. The joy in their eyes is infectious, and for a moment, the weight of the day's events melts away.

“Cậu Ash!” Theo exclaims, his eyes twinkling with mischief, “Tell us a detective story!”

“We want to be like you and Mợ Reine when we grow up!” Mia says, echoing her brother’s enthusiasm.

I look over at Reine, who smirks, a glint of amusement in her eyes. We agreed a long time ago that the real stories from our line of work aren't suitable for little ears. But it’s Tet, and I don’t want to let the kids down.

“Alright,” I start. “This is the story of brave Detective Theo and his brilliant younger sister, Detective Mia.”

Theo beams with pride, while Mia snuggles closer, her eyes wide with anticipation.

"When the story begins," I say, settling down on the living room floor with the kids clambering around me, "Theo and Mia found themselves in the heart of a big, bustling city. The city was lively, filled with music and colors, but it held a big secret."

Theo's eyes are wide, and he whispers to Mia, "That's like New Orleans!" Mia nods eagerly, her eyes never leaving my face.

"Yes, but you see," I continue, "there was a naughty bunch in town, making trouble for local shop owners like Mr. Delgado, the nice baker, and Mrs. King, the sweet florist. They were taking their money and making them very sad."

"Like bullies!" Mia interjects with a frown.

"Exactly like bullies, Mia," Reine affirms with a gentle smile. "But our private eyes knew that they should always stand up to bullies."

Theo whispers something into Mia's ear, and she giggles, covering her mouth with her hand.

Reine takes over, her eyes dancing with mischief. “Now, the leader of these bullies was called the Viper. And just like his name, he was slippery and dangerous.”

Mia’s eyes widen with a mix of fear and excitement. “That’s a scary name,” she whispers.

“Yes, it is,” I agree, nodding gravely. “But our duo are never afraid. They’re brave, like lions.”

Reine continues, “With the help of some friendly cats in the city, our detectives discovered that the Viper had a hideout. It was a secret place where they planned all their naughty schemes."

"Like a pirate ship?" Theo suggests.

Mia nods enthusiastically. "Or a spooky castle!"

I chuckle, "More like an old abandoned warehouse, but your ideas are way cooler."

Reine nods. "Inside the warehouse, Theo and Mia found all sorts of evidence that the bullies had been up to no good."

"The two detectives, using their clever skills, gathered all the evidence and took it straight to the police," I add. "The police were very impressed with their work and soon arrested the bullies, making sure they couldn't bother Mr. Delgado, Mrs. King, or any other shopkeepers again."

Mia claps her hands in delight. "Yay for Detective Theo and Detective Mia!"

"And do you know what happened next? The shopkeepers were so grateful to the brave detectives that they threw a big party in their honor. They even gave them a special reward." Reine winks at me, her face bright with amusement, the tension from before seeming to melt.

I pull out two small red envelopes from my pocket. "Here's your reward, brave detectives," I say, handing one envelope to each child.

Theo and Mia hop from foot to foot in excitement, their young energy palpable. Kira gives them a stern but affectionate look. "Now, what do you say when someone gives you a gift?"

The pair pause, glancing at each other as if to confirm their response. In unison, they bend at the waist, performing a small bow. "Cảm ơn Cậu Ash, cảm ơn Mợ Reine," they chorus, their Vietnamese impeccable. It's a clear sign of Kira's efforts to instill in them a connection to their roots.

"You're very welcome, mes amours," Reine responds.

The children's laughter fills the air as they dart away, the envelopes clutched tightly in their hands, eager to share their treasures with their cousins.

Kira watches them go, a tender smile playing on her lips. As the sound of their laughter fades into the background hum of conversation and clinking dishware, her expression changes, the fatigue and melancholy creeping back into her eyes.

She leans against the doorway, arms crossed loosely over her chest. "You and Reine... you’re really good with them,” Kira murmurs, her voice soft.

I offer a modest shrug, feeling the warmth of her words. “They're great kids, em.”

If she only knew. The tale I'd spun for the kids was a sanitized version of the gritty reality. There really was a protection racket. The Viper was no fictional bully, but Vincent "The Viper" Marcello, a feared Mafia capo. Reine and I had infiltrated his compound, swiping a hard drive teeming with evidence of his dirty dealings, including evidence linking him to least three murders.

I also deliberately left out the grizzly part of the story where we abducted one of Marcello's thugs and pistol whipped him with the gun he'd used to threaten the shopkeepers until he gave away his boss’s hideout.

I gently touch her arm. “So, how are you holding up?” I ask in a soft voice, leaning closer so as to keep the conversation private amidst the bustle of the celebration.

She offers a small, tight-lipped smile, a reflexive gesture that doesn’t reach her eyes. “Oh, you know, I’m doing...” Her voice trails off, her gaze drifting to where her kids had disappeared. “I’m managing.”

"Do you want to talk about it?" I ask gently.

“Not right now,” she replies, her voice a whispered sigh.

—

After dinner, with stomachs filled and hearts warmed by food and familial laughter, Reine and I make our way to the kitchen to help clean up. The counters are littered with dirty dishes, remnants of the sumptuous feast we all enjoyed. The sink’s faucet runs in a steady stream as we rinse and stack the dishes for washing, working in comfortable silence as the sounds of the celebration continue in the other rooms.

Kira slips into the kitchen, her expression soft. “Chị Reine, why don’t you go join the others?” she suggests. “I heard they’re starting karaoke in the living room.”

Reine's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, a light laugh escaping her lips. “Oh, I can’t sing, especially not in Vietnamese,” she protests.

Kira smiles, drying her hands on a dish towel. “They have English songs too, you know.”

“You can keep Abby company,” I say, nodding toward the living room where I see Abby, who's had one too many beers, flirting unabashedly with my cousin Dan.

“She seems to be doing just fine,” she observes, still hesitant.

“Come on, I’ll take your place here. Besides,” she says, casting a glance in my direction, “I have a lot to catch up on with my big brother.”

Before Reine could protest, other family members peek into the kitchen, echoing Kira’s sentiments and whisking her away into the other room.

With Reine now out of the kitchen and the hum of a familiar ballad emanating from the living room, Kira and I find ourselves surrounded by the relative quiet.

The moment is disrupted by the rustle of plastic as Kira gestures to the bags of trash filling a corner of the kitchen. "Hey, anh, can you help me take out the trash?"

I nod, grabbing a bag and following her out the back door. The night air is cool and crisp, a stark contrast to the warm bustle inside. The sky is painted with a million stars, and the distant chirping of crickets creates a quiet background rhythm.

After we dump the trash bags into the bins, I notice Kira’s gaze drifting towards the backyard’s far corner. It’s where we used to have a secret hiding place as kids, a little nook in the hedge where we would discuss our greatest adventures and plans. The hedge has grown thick and wild, but the nook still seems to be there.

"Remember that place?" Kira asks, her voice wistful.

"How could I forget?" I reply, a hint of a smile playing on my lips.

Walking over to the hedge, the crunch of the grass beneath our feet breaks the silence of the night.We stand before it, side by side, our breath visible in the cool night air. A flood of memories rushes back.

“Alright, spill it, Kira,” I say in a low voice. “What was that cryptic text about?”

She takes a deep breath, and in the glow of the stars, her eyes glisten with unshed tears. “I’m scared, anh,” she whispers.

The vulnerability in her voice tugs at my heart, and I reach out, squeezing her hand reassuringly. “What’s going on?”

She hesitates, taking a moment to gather her thoughts before speaking. "It's about Xuan. I'm worried. He's...he's changed. I think he's involved in something dangerous, and I fear for his safety."

"How do you know?" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady.

Her voice trembles as she recounts her recent encounter. "A few nights ago, I went to his apartment to pick up some things for the kids. I wasn't expecting him to be home, but he was there… with a woman.”

I narrow my eyes, feeling a prickle of irritation. My mind jumps to conclusions. "Kira, he's not your responsibility anymore. If he's seeing another woman, it's none of your—"

Kira whirls around to face me, her eyes ablaze with frustration, cutting me off mid-sentence. "Ash, that's not it. Listen to me!" She takes a deep, shaky breath, and her voice drops to a whisper.

"The woman... She was dressed in a long, dark robe, and her face was covered with some kind of ornate mask. They were standing in the living room, holding hands in a circle with other people in similar outfits.

I let out an audible sigh, brushing off her concerns. “It sounds like he's just involved with someone who’s into New Age shit—”

"Stop, just stop! It's not what you think," she insists, desperation threading her voice. She fumbles with her phone, her fingers trembling as she quickly navigates to her gallery. She thrusts the device into my hands, a video queued on the screen. "Watch this."

I press play, and the video opens with a shaky view of Xuan’s apartment from the partially obscured doorway, probably taken while Kira was hiding. The ambiance is dim, only illuminated by the gentle flicker of countless candles, casting eerie, dancing shadows on the walls.

In the middle of the room, Xuan stands surrounded by a group of similarly masked individuals. Their robes are not just dark – they seem to absorb the light around them, as if they are made from the very fabric of the void. The chanting begins softly, almost drowned out by the waxing and waning of the wind outside, but it quickly escalates, growing louder and more frantic.

Suddenly, a dark mass starts to form in the middle of the circle. It doesn’t make any logical sense; it’s as if the very fabric of reality is tearing apart. This inky blackness writhes and pulsates, taking on an almost liquid form before solidifying into a shapeless, hulking mass.

The mass seems to shimmer and undulate, as if it's not completely of this dimension, and its presence feels... oppressive, as though it’s emanating a force that threatens to crush everything in its wake. The masked figures, including Xuan, begin to levitate, drawn towards this entity as if caught in its gravitational pull.

Whispers echo around the room, not from the people present but from the entity itself. It speaks in a multitude of voices, a cacophonous symphony of tones and pitches, the language indescribable and unlike anything of this earth. The voices grow louder, building to a deafening crescendo before everything suddenly goes quiet.

The abrupt silence is stifling. The creature, a maelstrom of shadows and whispers, speaks again, this time in English. The voice is a myriad of tones intertwined, reverberating in chilling harmony, like the sound of an ancient, cosmic bell. "The spheres align. Three days. The passageway will unfurl," it intones.

Then, as if sensing an outside presence, the entity starts to turn slowly, its amorphous form constantly shifting as if trying to find a face within its depths. Just as it seems to lock onto the camera's location, the video ends abruptly, the screen going black.

I stare at the phone in my hands, my heart racing and my mind struggling to process what I've just witnessed. I look up at Kira, trying to gauge her reaction.

"That's all I could capture without being seen," she whispers, her voice quivering with terror. "I left as quickly and quietly as I could."

I replay the video, hoping to catch some indication that what I've just witnessed was some kind of elaborate trick or hoax. With each playback, I try to dissect every frame, every pixel, looking for a flaw or telltale sign of special effects or CGI. But nothing seems amiss.

"It's probably just some kind of art project, or... practical effects, you know? Maybe augmented reality or something," I say, attempting to sound more convinced than I feel.

Kira's eyes plead with me, her expression fraught with worry. "You know that isn't true, Ash. I've never seen anything like that. There was something… malevolent about it."

"I don't know what's going on with him, but this... this is way beyond our understanding," I reply, frustration evident in my voice.

She steps closer, her voice taking on an urgent tone. "Please, Ash. I don't care if we can't explain it. I just want to know he's okay."

I grit my teeth, clenching my fists. "Why do you still care? After everything?"

Her eyes glisten, and she looks away for a moment before meeting my gaze. "He might have hurt me, but he's still the father of my children. I have to know he's safe. For the kids."

The memories flood back in a tidal wave. The last time I saw anything close to the fear I see in Kira’s eyes right now was years ago during her college days. She'd come home with a black eye, attempting to hide it behind oversized sunglasses and hastily applied makeup. I remember the white-hot rage that had boiled within me. We didn’t need words; I knew exactly who had done it. That evening, her then-boyfriend learned the hard way that no one hurt my little sister and got away with it.

Taking a deep breath, I meet Kira's gaze, the weight of the situation settling in. “Okay,” I relent. “I’ll help. But we do this carefully and intelligently.”

She grips my arm, her touch filled with gratitude and desperation. “Thank you, anh. But you have to promise not to tell Reine about this.”

“Why not? Is it because she’s not Viet?” I ask, my voice tinged with a hint of irritation. The question instantly sets a spark in Kira’s eyes.

“How dare you ask me that?” she retorts, offended. “I love Reine like a sister. It’s not about that. I just... I can’t have anyone know, not even mom and dad. Please, this stays between us.”

I nod, keeping the storm of thoughts at bay for a moment as I agree to Kira's condition. My heart thuds against my chest, mirroring the pounding rhythm of a war drum. We're interrupted by a sudden rustling and a beam of light illuminating the hedges, turning the leaves a vivid, almost otherworldly green.

Reine steps into view, her brows knitted in confusion. “What are you two doing in the bushes?”

We stand, realizing that the childhood nook doesn't conceal us like it used to. The growth spurts over the years have rendered the hiding spot ineffective. We tower over the hedge.

“Just reminiscing about old times,” Kira says quickly, her voice strained yet stable. The vulnerability from moments ago has receded behind a mask of normalcy.

Reine eyes us skeptically but shakes her head with a playful smile. "Well, I just did a rendition of 'Billie Jean.' Your cousin Michelle says I ate, whatever that means,'" she says, brandishing a microphone like a trophy. "Your turn to suffer, my love."

I take the mic from Reine, my hand brushing against hers. Her skin is warm and comforting, a stark contrast to the chill that has settled deep within my bones. “You set the bar so high,” I tease with a forced laugh, trying to make light of the situation. “I don’t know how I can compete with the Cajun Queen.”

Reine laughs. “Oh, just wait till you see me moonwalk,” she teases, her eyes twinkling.

As we walk back towards the laughter and light of the living room, Kira's gaze finds mine, a silent plea reflected in her eyes, reinforcing the pact of secrecy between us. I give her a subtle nod, a promise shrouded in dread and uncertainty.
