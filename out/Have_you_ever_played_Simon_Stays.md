On an August afternoon in 2008, Richie Hall asked that benign question. Sitting atop a hill, I twisted my head away from the spectacular view of our town below and lifted an inquisitive eyebrow at my friend. We were only ten years old, and my initial thought was that Richie had misspoken.

“Don’t you mean ‘Simon Says’?” I asked.

Richie shook his head. “Simon *Stays*.”

“No,” I answered. “I’ve never played that.”

“Daniel told me about it,” Richie continued. “He said it’s only for adults.”

“Ewww… This isn’t going to be like the time that-”

“- It’s not porn, Amber,” Richie interrupted.

“I still have nightmares of those two girls and-”

“- It’s *not* porn,” Richie adamantly reiterated. “It’s a game for adults. Are you an adult, Amber?“

I frowned. “No, Richie, and neither are you. But I’m old enough to know that urban legends are dumb.”

Richie huffed. “You’re worse than Daniel. Don’t you want to prove that we’re as brave as that smug prick?”

“I just know that anything he’s suggested must be either dangerous or disgusting — usually a combination of the two,” I said.

“Why don’t I show you how it works? Then you can decide whether you want to play,” Richie suggested.

He had a feverish look in his eyes. I’d seen it countless times. He was wonderful in so many ways, but the boy always had something to prove, and that often hampered his rationality. Something which became all too clear to me when my dear friend began to speak in tongues.

I’ve no idea what Richie said, but I wouldn’t dare to repeat it — some readers might have reckless ideas. Anyway, after several minutes of chanting that chilled my flesh, Richie stopped and looked at me.

“Want to play?” He asked.

I gulped and nodded. I’m not sure why. Curiosity or hypnosis. Take your pick. Something drove me to join Richie on his hellish quest.

“Firstly, we choose a place to seek him. Let’s hope he’s listening,” Richie said. “Simon stays… in the graveyard.”

The town church sat at the foot of the hill. My friend leapt to his feet, pointing at the steeple which loomed above the overgrown graveyard. As he started to stomp down the hill, my chest tightened.

“I don’t want to do this,” I said.

“Graveyards aren’t scary,” Richie assured me. “You don’t need to be afraid.”

“You know why I don’t want to go down there,” I muttered.

It was where my mother was buried. And when Richie remembered that, he hung his head in shame.

“Listen… Simon Stays… It’s more than a game. If we find him, Simon can answer any and all questions. Come with me, and you can finally find peace,” Richie said, stretching a hand towards me.

“Who is Simon?” I whispered.

“Let’s find out,” He replied.

Eyeing the setting Sun, which fell from a reddening sky, I held my friend’s hand and descended the hill towards our sleepy town. In the decaying light, the graveyard became more than headstones — it become a shadowy chasm in the earth. A gateway into Hell itself.

Perhaps I blindly followed Richie through the gate into that darkened graveyard because I’d always loved him. Perhaps ten-year-olds have a natural tendency to act foolishly. Whatever the case, I squeezed Richie’s hand tightly as we wandered and weaved through the headstones.

“What are we hoping to find?” I shakily asked.

There came a wheeze from a nearby gravestone. In horror, I turned my head, but there was nothing to be seen. And then Richie’s hand slipped out of mine. When I twisted to face him, he was sprinting into the night.

“Richie?” I called after him. “Don’t leave me here!”

“Can’t you hear Simon?” Richie cried joyously. “He’s going to answer my questions.”

I lost sight of my friend behind some gravestones, and I ran after him with trembling legs. The lightless graveyard had already terrified me, but it plunged to a new level of horror once I was alone. I shrieked Richie’s name until my throat went dry. He’d vanished from sight, and every part of my body was screeching at me to go home. I knew my mother would be worrying.

But then I heard a sound.

A hummed tune. It sounded vaguely like a dissonant version of a children’s lullaby, though I couldn’t place which one, and that only unsettled me more deeply. And when Richie finally emerged from the shadows, I screamed.

His skin had withered, and it was clear that he had aged. But he looked older than any living human — *hundreds* of years old. As if he had spent centuries learning terrible truths from Simon. This impossibility had ridden Richie of his humanity, and the decrepit figure only filled me with terror beyond comprehension.

“W… What happened to you?” I asked.

Richie smiled a yellow, toothy grin. “Simon answers all questions, but everyone stays… And *you’ll* stay, Amber, when he’s answered your questions.”

“I don’t want answers,” I whimpered, backing away from the abomination that used to be my friend.

In the dim moonlight, I started to notice the full extent of his dreadful features. His pupils were black saucers that filled most of his eyes. But it was a black *fullness*, not emptiness — they were eyes of knowledge. Too much knowledge, it seemed.

“Too late. You’re playing the game,” Richie giggled. “Simon *must* answer your question. And when he does, you must stay here… forever. For his knowledge is too great to fall upon the ears of those outside our little game. It’s a secret, Amber. Can you keep a secret?”

I darted as fast as my legs could carry me. I heard the inhuman Richie howl behind me, and he scurried after me with a tremendous amount of noise. I didn’t turn around to verify that — I had to trust my ears.

The gate was in sight, but Simon, or whatever possessed Richie, had transformed my friend into an unstoppable machine. I only had one shot at freedom, and it was based on an unsubstantiated hunch.

When that green, metal gate opened and closed without any altercation with Richie/Simon, I breathed a sigh of relief. What horrified me more than anything, however, was the realisation that I was still staring at the sun-human monstrosity that used to be my dearest human. It didn’t cross the boundaries of the graveyard, but it didn’t need to do so — it already struck fear into my heart.

I winced, bracing for a bony hand to rush over the gate and seize me by the neck. Instead, Richie — or the thing that used to be Richie — turned and fled.

To this day, nobody has been able to locate my missing childhood friend. And only I know the truth.

Richie stays… in the graveyard.
