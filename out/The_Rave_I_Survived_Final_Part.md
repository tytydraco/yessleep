Chimes marched through several bars, progressing through simple chords over a worbling synth that sounded like it was playing through a tape deck. Monarch narrowed her eyes and focused on the hand I held high. The fabric wristband slowly slid down my tacky skin, leaving crimson copper-smelling streaks. Monarch then laughed. "So you may belong." Monarch waved off the weeping. Two of the cheery stagehands took the steps on either side of the room and walked up to me. The one on my right lowered the mirror to a comfortable height. Two neat lines of silver and blue powder remained on the mirror, traces of a dozen or so other lines occupying the rest of the smooth surface.

Monarch was leaning forward in her chair, twisted smile reflecting in their predatory gaze. I took up the red metal tube and felt around the smooth finish of the edges. I fumbled with it in my left hand to bring it to a nostril. The metal clinked as its edge met the glass. I lined up with the sparkling powder and felt my chest contract and tense as I exhaled in preparation. My body shook as my chest ignited with new pain, the deep inhale that pulled the sparkling powder through my nose, expanding my lungs to push against the still fractured ribs. It felt like something thin and rigid was being forced through my body. Suppressing the urge to cough, my chest ached as if it were being split open. When I slowly exhaled, it felt like the entire room snapped back into place with sharp contrast. The lilting melody even sounded crisper and clearer, like speakers had been pulled out of water. The mirror was lifted away, and the drink platter lowered in its place. I plucked a purple drink from the center on impulse, it standing out amongst a collection of red liquids.

"Good," Monarch giggled. "Perhaps I can find a place for you. Come." She gestured for me to join her crowd. I struggled up the stairs even as the disparate hurt turned to a single nagging sensation, like a string was tugging on my clothes. At the top, Monarch directed me to her left, away from Rabbit, who was still fixated on their unsipped drink.

I honored the direction, careful to avoid whatever dividing line existed in Monarch's mind. I slipped into the crowd, the various faces and expressions warped through the haze of my sharpening attention. A smile stood out, a wide thing that drew close to my face. "You seem a bit watered down," Sunglasses said. In that reflection, I saw my painted expression holding more composure than I felt. Around us, the drone of side conversations rose in competition with the swelling synthetic orchestra.

"Been a long evening," I clarified.

"No longer than most," Sunglasses pointed out.

"I'm on edge as is," I stated, unsure what other defense I had.

"Oh, good. We wouldn't want to take up too much space from Monarch, now would we?"

"Sarcasm?"

"Only as much as you want it to be." I barely caught a glimpse of the new performance, where one person began to affectionately wind a colored rope around another.

"You said it's always easier to swim with the current," I said.

"But I didn't say it was always necessary," Sunglasses retorted.

"What if I drown?"

"Is that any worse than you feel now?"

"No, I suppose not."

"Remember, their rules are unfair, little owl." Sunglasses leaned back and raised a hand, fingers pinched together. Their purple bracelet dangled among their other accessories, and I could have sworn it looked like the wristband was taped back together in a few places. At that distance, I saw the crowd in those darkened lenses warp and grow into irregular outlines, but I finally appeared to scale. The makeup, so carefully applied, did well to hide my frown and subtly exaggerate the few elements I appreciated in my own face. Absentmindedly, I had raised my throbbing and numb hand to hover under Sunglasses. They dropped something into my palm, their other hand encouraging my remaining fingers to shut tight around it. Sunglasses turned to leave.

"I could use some luck," I whispered after them.

"Take it." Sunglasses grinned and then vanished, the hem of their designer coat slipping out of view last.

I stared down at my hand as the world continued around me. I felt a hesitation to open my hand and view Sunglasses gift; whatever it was had been given in secret among a floor of open secrets. In the midst of a debate about whether to look or not, I looked up to watch as a slender body was raised into the air. Their arms were held to their back, the curves of their figure accentuated with bright cord. Shibari, I think it's called. They spun slowly to accompany the hefty but purposefully short kick drums that pushed the song forward. The suspended performer began to spin onto their back, and their heels began to rise while their head dipped down. They looked relaxed and calm as if they belonged in those bindings and trusted the performer on the other side of the act. I couldn't empathize with the thought; it was utterly alien to me.

"Hey," one of the few voices I'd recognize whispered behind me. Rabbit stepped up beside me.

"Hey," I replied, a little dumbfounded and still trying to pull myself out of my thoughts.

"I'm really surprised to see you here," they said, and I could have sworn there was excitement in their voice. One of their cheeks was bruised. More bruises tried to hide under the collar of their shirt.

"Really?"

"Yeah, most everyone just sticks to a dance floor or two."

"How well do you know, Monarch?"

"About as well as she'll let anyone know her." Rabbit shrugged. I nodded, almost understanding. Snare and hat began to exchange strikes like the ticking of a clock. The synths were put aside for choral singing and a layer of something shaking.

"Is she always this rotten?" I asked pointedly. Rabbit's cheek twitched as if to grimace before thinking better of it.

"She can be rough, but she has her nights. But, hey, you're here. You're really here." I couldn't look at Rabbit for a second and turned my eyes down. I noticed their knuckles were broken open, and some of the wounds were still oozing blood. Their white wristband was gone, replaced by a red one.

"I'm excited to see you, by the way," I confessed to both of us. I looked up to see the blush I felt reflected in their cheeks.

"Me too," they added for unneeded emphasis.

The music stopped.

"Drop them," Monarch said casually. The bound performer's eyes went wide. I looked to Rabbit, who grimaced and then looked down. There was a beat of hesitation, and Monarch's perfectly trimmed brows furrowed together. The binding performer released the rope, and their partner started to the ground with violent acceleration.

I pushed my way forward, almost collapsing from my leg, which wanted nothing but rest. "Wait!" I yelled to the gasp of many. The binding performer grabbed the ropes, faltering once as they clearly burned their hands. The bound performer jerked to a stop, winding up in the excess cord that disrupted the overall careful aesthetic that had been cultivated.

"I thought you had found your place," Monarch said, slouching to the side of her seat.

"I did," I said, stopping for what probably seemed like dramatic emphasis when it was really to give myself time to think. Monarch swirled her hand through the air in front of her, demanding me to proceed. "And honestly, it's there, on the floor before you." Monarch seemed ever so slightly intrigued by this tactic. "And I just couldn't bear to think they'd be the most broken toy tonight." I waved dismissively at the hanging bound performer.

"So you are offering another show?"

"I am."

"You weren't on the schedule exactly."

"Schedules are so boring."

"Fine, I'll give you one song to do whatever you like, then you have one song to do whatever I like." Monarch's smile told me all I needed to know about the second part.

"Deal," I agreed. Monarch then waved me back to the floor. Standing near a bloody shoe print, I kicked off my sneakers. I kept my back to Monarch, Rabbit, and the crowd. The object in my hand was a small purple pill. I put it on the edge of the glass and then downed the drink despite the sour burn. As the glass left my lips, a cheerful stagehand appeared at my side, empty platter extended. He left my side as soon as the empty glass was placed on his tray.

The lights dimmed to black.

I lowered myself to lounge with my feet off to one side, bad crossed over the good. I promised my body it had to hold together just a little longer.
An ambient hiss began to fill my ears; through it, a near-imperceptible click marked intervals I characterized as beats. I started to match my breathing to the meter.

Inhale, one, two.
Exhale, three, four.

A violin stuttered through a note.

A single light turned on with a clunk, revealing me and the floor immediately around me but leaving all else in darkness. My shoulders swayed to the developing track, clicks now paired with military-style snare strikes.

Bum, bum, bum, berrum. Bum, bum, bum, berrum.

I pushed my hands to the floor and twisted my body around to pull my legs under me as a sweeping bass led a section of strings up through the first variant of the melody. 

My heart raced; I had long since forgotten what moves came from formal training and what had come from just night after night on a dance floor. In retrospect, it was a silly thing to be concerned about, but in that moment, all I could actually think of was my own performance.

A woodwind snatched the top line from the strings as a jagged bass bounced between notes with the steady snare. I rolled my shoulders into pushing my chest out despite the the fractured ribs that wholly opposed the motion.

Additional percussion rattled around the melody that was slowly drifting away from the pattern, one misplaced note at a time. I dragged my screaming feet under me, ankles crossed.

A crash of hats cut the woodwinds short. A piano chord stung at the composition. To its call, I answered, rising to my feet through core and leg strength alone, hands held carefully near my shoulders.

More lights clanked on, revealing a complement of additional performers in red leotards and skirts. Their masks were perfectly serene except for the eyes that darted about critically.

I took one spinning step forward with the pull of the distorted bass that slid from one note of the melody to another, piano striking at every root, third, and fifth chord. I took another sliding step forward, and the other dancers around me took steps measured in fractions of inches while en pointe.

The kick drum pushed an opening into the mix with a heavy, hollow, resounding tone. To its moan, I bowed low, slouching one shoulder low. I kept my hips aligned, legs straight, the injured foot stretched far to the side. I could feel the tugging pain of the wound reopening, and dragging it back as I stood straight resulted in a choppy trail of smeared blood.
The performance had to go on; the call of pain was nothing to the siren song of the synths.

I bit down on my molars as I put weight on my tiptoes. My injured foot burned, trying to tell me of an irrelevant danger. The other performers dropped to the flat of their feet as they huddled together behind me, heads tilting every which way. Their sharp eyes judged me and measured each other.

Strings turned to sharp notes that tore at the piano as it played a new variant of the melody over and over. Synths pulled the notes along to keep pace with the beat suitable for a club. I raised my hands above my head and began to pull my weight off my bad foot, only to catch hisses from behind the masks that surrounded me.

So, I adapted. In unison, the instruments dropped to a low note, and I put all my weight on the burning coal that was my injured foot. As the purposeful noises raced up the scale, I swung my good foot up behind me till I bent at the hip with the foot above my head. I held it even through my shaking calf that wanted to just drop me.

Military snares returned to dominance as the track stripped to bare, clean synths whispering a feint melody in my ear. I turned myself upright with both tiptoes on the ground and then tipped back, letting the other dancers catch me in a net of their arms.

They grimaced down on me, holding me till the strings screeched for the pattern to halt. The dancers threw me back onto my feet, where I pushed all the momentum into a heel, allowing me to spin while the song found its way forward. Woodwinds painted a new melody for string and electronic tones to follow. I stepped out onto my bad foot only to have it slide back over the ground and under my good foot.

The dancers scurried back and spread out before imitating the shuffle.
Bells like falling glass pulled the presiding tune into something I felt I had only heard in a daydream.

I stepped onto my tiptoes and then spun into another step, using momentum to appear to step in the opposite direction I moved. The dancers kept pace, each movement bringing them closer to me once more.

The hollow kick returned, counting me down to the next collapse of the verse. I jumped from one tiptoe, then to the next.

Then the crash, as a detuned bas, absorbed the other sounds. I let myself fall onto my knees and caught my weight with my hands. It felt like a molten metal rod was shoved from my bad hand up through my shoulder blade. I remained perfectly postured, much to the dismay of the other dancers, who had collapsed into various shapes on the floor. Strings softly experimented with notes the throbbing bass would allow. I kept the beat bouncing in my chest, confident my heart was surely now a part of the percussion.

Through the darkness, I saw an outline —a thin, white glow that surely marked the boundaries of a door. I knew it was important, but it didn't strike me why through the bliss I somehow felt from dancing alone, even with pain fighting every movement.

Only strings remained, weaving between low, slow notes, and high notes played quickly together. My shoulders took the sway of my chest and spread it to my arms. I rose to my feet once more but kept myself bent low so my hands brushed over the ground where the other dancers still lay. I could see smears of blood and small pools where my foot had been. Snapping percussion came in with a rising swish. With the strings speeding to a conclusion, I began to rise up with each beat. Each dancer on the floor twisted their body and contorted their way back to their feet.
When the piano began a frantic sprint back through the original melody, I followed its lead. En pointe, I sprinted to one side of the light, the other dancers chasing after me.

There was a lull as a bass cut in to drag the melody back as if it had caught it and me. I leaned forward, gloved hands grabbing at my arms and shoulders. I leaned forward till almost no weight remained on my feet, trusting the other dancers to obey the music.
They did, of course.

When the piano struck back, I was released from them and sprinted to the other side.

We repeated the dramatic dip.

And then the music stopped.

In that brief moment, all I felt was elation. Sweat dotted my brow, and my breathing struggled through my broken body. Yet, I was ecstatic, with endorphins rewarding me for meeting the challenge of the song.

The lights returned, and a single person clapped behind me.

Monarch.

It was like rolling out of a nap. Confusion was short-lived, replaced with a stark understanding of where I was.

There was the door. Behind Monarch's throne, a single black door resided quietly.

"That was quite amusing," Monarch complimented(?).

"Thank you, but that wasn't for you," I said, still trying to catch my breath. Monarch scowled.

"Did you forget you belong?"

"No, I have decided that I don't though." Monarch didn't like that clarification.

"Did you forget who decides that?"

"I did for a second, but I remember now. I decide." Monarch's nostrils flared, and for a second, I thought she was going to scream. Instead, she straightened her posture under the crown painted on her chair. She smoothed out the front of her dress and forced her face to relax.

"We still have our deal."

"Wasn't with me."

"Then who was it with?" Monarch fumed, amusing my little game.

"I'll let you know when I figure out who that was."

"Grab them," Monarch commanded simply, clearly done with the game. I wasn't, though. The dancers rushed at me, and I sprinted up the stairs. At the last step, my foot struck the ledge, my tired leg failing to clear the architecture. I fell onto my face, barely managing to throw my right hand out to avoid crushing the already aching limb. Monarch laughed while one of her dancers grabbed my wrist and pulled me to my feet.

The dancer's fingers pressed around the bracelet I had been gifted. The single word emblazoned on it was all I could think of.

E S C A P E

I took a step forward, jerking the dancer up the stairs with me. The other dancers added their weight to the grip, their hands piling on each other around my wrist. Pain wanted me to give in. Pain wanted me to give up.

"Give up, I don't lose," Monarch sneered.

Another tug and another forced step. Blood splashed out from my injured foot, staining the ground at Monarch's feet. There was a loud twang as the threading of my gifted bracelet snapped. Beads burst outward, all eventually finding the ground in sharp patterns like rain on a tin roof. The dancers all fell backward into a pile.

I propelled myself forward to the inept gasps and cries of Monarch's crowd.

I stomped onto my good foot, using the sense of relief to temper myself for the next stomp onto my bad foot. My hip jerked as if to force my leg out from under me, but I didn't allow it.

Another step, the door was close.

Feet were pounding up the stairs after me.

Another step and bolt of agony through my leg.

I crashed into the black door, which flew open and then slammed shut behind me.

--------------

The rolling world slowed to a stop. I laid on my back, not quite believing the quiescent fervor. There was no murmur, distant or close. The light was persistent and lacking of romantic hue. Everything smelt vaguely damp and fetid. The walls were a mix of concrete and sheet metal decorated with overlapping graffiti. The doorways deeper into the empty warehouse space were half-collapsed, the rubble only dissuading those with a worry about tetanus.

Further down the hall, an orange dawn crept in through giant tile windows. Broken wooden pallets were piled up along the wall. Glass bottles, aluminum wrappers, plastic bags, and all matter of urban detritus littered the floor and collected in the corners. Ripped clothing hung abandoned from exposed rebar.

I crawled down the hall, not literally, of course. I was limping, avoiding putting weight on my foot that had stopped bleeding once more, but hurt more than ever. I could no longer ignore or move past the pain. I leaned against the wall whenever it seemed safe enough to do so, which was not often.

At the end of the hall was a room. An entryway with giant wooden spools, concrete blocks, and cut-up 2x4s. At one end of the room was a collection of abandoned furniture that had been repurposed into a bar, now sticky and barely holding together. I had been here. So many hours ago.

Light streamed through the cracks in and around a thin plywood door that hung on makeshift hinges. An old exit sign swung from dead wires in front of the door. I dragged myself through the impromptu obstacle course and to the door. Thick motes of dust drifted through the day, breaking into the room.

When I went to pass the exit sign, something gave way with a crackle. I pressed myself against the door just in time to avoid the sign, old bracing and all, landing on my head.

One less injury to worry about. 

--------------

One last transition.

I stepped through the thin, creaky door and into a pale morning. It was a bit past dawn and annoyingly bright. Wispy clouds were kind enough to take the brunt of the sunshine.

It had been a long time since I saw this hour from either side of sleep.

In my original account, the one I turned in to my therapist, this is the end of the story. It isn’t, though. There is one last encounter.

Now, for what truly happened.

Standing in the empty line queue was Rabbit. They looked even paler in the light except for their bruises, which were remarkably darker. They tried to smile, hiding a wince. I limped closer till nothing, but silence remained between us. Rabbit broke first.

“Hey.”

“Why’d you invite me?”

“ ,” silence responded.

“I thought you’d fit in,” Rabbit clarified.

“I’d fit in?”

“It can be painful, but eventually, everyone finds their place.” Rabbit held one hand in the other, thumb rubbing at the palm as if trying to scrape away paint.

“I don’t think I fit in,” I said. The lone flame of anger in my chest was slowly choking out, too tired to continue.

“You could,” Rabbit offered, cutting silence off. I shook my head. 

“I would like to see you again,” I offered pitifully. A confession I hadn’t been prepared to make that sent my heart racing. Despite the city heat, I suddenly felt cold. It was Rabbit’s turn to shake their head. “I understand,” I whispered into the hungry silence. I wanted Rabbit to apologize, to express any regret they had led me to harm. I wasn’t going to get that, though; I knew that. So, instead, I thanked them. “Thank you.”

My foot pushed loose stones away till my shoe pressed against Rabbit’s. I leaned up and touched my lips to theirs. The warmth chased the chill from my face, bringing a blush to my cheeks. Even frozen in that simple interaction, the bare structure of a kiss, my body screamed for more. I felt Rabbit’s hand move to hover over my hip. Fingertips pushed against their ribs, pleading for return. The demand was met, and the steady hand fell to my waistline. They tilted their head, lips sliding together like gears finding purchase. Our shoulders pushed together as we leaned into each other. My breath caught as fingers found purchase near the top of my spine, hand cupping my jawline. My lips parted slightly, allowing the shared breath to feed the heat in my body. I felt both our rigid and sore figures slope into comfort. In that moment, all I wanted was more, a terrible taste of desire that would never be satisfied. A sharp exhale, not sure whose, snuffed out the moment. We hesitated as if both of us were unsure who should lead. When neither of us did, we fell apart.

I don’t know how long it took me to find the courage to step around Rabbit.

“Wait,” they called after. I turned toward Rabbit, their face hidden as they bent down to the ground. I refused to acknowledge the tear rolling down my cheek, to give the sadness that threatened to drown me power.

When Rabbit stood back up, there was a weight to their expression, a heaviness that carried far more than they’d ever revealed. They held out a slightly scuffed, somewhat dirty pair of shoes with sticky bottoms. A cute pair of black shoes with the silhouette of bunnies on the heel.

“That was the deal, wasn’t it?” They said.

“I guess it was,” I said, gingerly taking the shoes.

“Find your way around some time,” they said. 

The morning breeze cut between us.

“Goodbye,” I whispered, turning away.
