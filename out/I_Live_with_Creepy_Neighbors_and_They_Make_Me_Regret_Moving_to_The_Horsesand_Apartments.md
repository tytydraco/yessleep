 live in this apartment complex called Horsesand. I won't reveal the exact location for obvious reasons. I lived here for the past three years, an affordable rent that's easy on the wallet.

  
Right from the start, there's been a strange vibe in this complex. It all began with my encounter with Cathie, my next-door neighbor. Cathie's an elderly woman who has an annoying habit of swiping my mail and scolding me for the tiniest bit of noise. She's a real piece of shit, let me tell you. She's 73 and lives with two cats who are surprisingly well-behaved compared to her but also smell like her. I actually feel sorry for those cats having to deal with her.  


Now, let's go back to the day I first met Cathie. I had just moved out of my parent's place and was excited about the constant nagging to stop. I saw Cathie struggling to haul this massive electric wheelchair up the stairs. It was no ordinary wheelchair; it was this huge electric chair that you wouldn't expect to find outside of a hospital. I tried to be polite and said, "Hi there, I'm your new neighbor." Her response was cold and ominous, "Don't make any noise or I'll report you." With that, she wheeled herself into her apartment, and there was this strong smell of ammonia lingering behind. I would find out this is normal for her. She doesn't really need the wheelchair but uses it anyways.  


Later on, as I was enjoying my new home, I was interrupted by a loud banging on the wall we share. It was Cathie, demanding that I keep it down. I wasn't even doing anything to make noise, but I decided to respond with a gentle knock on the wall. This weird back-and-forth went on every half-hour until she finally seemed to get the message.

  
The next day took a bad turn when I found out my mailbox had been emptied, including a package I had been waiting for. I figured I should talk to Cathie about it. She answered the door with hostility, but when I pointed out the obvious signs of my Amazon delivery, she reluctantly handed it over, along with a strong smell of cat urine. As I was leaving, I heard her muttering something like an incantation, which only fueled my suspicions.  
My day got worse as I was going down the staircase to my car. I tripped over something I couldn't see, but thankfully, I wasn't hurt. However, when I was driving to work, there was a car crash right in front of me, and I got stuck for an hour. I was already frustrated, and when I finally got to work, my computer decided to slow down to a crawl, making it impossible to meet my deadlines.  


The trip back home wasn't any better. Road closures and endless red lights turned my commute into a nightmare. At this point, it felt like Cathie's strange actions were somehow affecting my reality. It's hard to explain, but it's like there were shadows lurking at the edge of my vision, waiting for something. I felt this urgent need to get home like something was about to jump out at me.

  
Determined to confront Cathie, I knocked on her door again. This time, she looked more surprised than angry. Without saying a word, she went back into her apartment, leaving me baffled. Cathie, my seemingly ordinary neighbor but also a real asshole, seemed to hold some power over my well-being or it's ya know my parinoia. And then, out of nowhere, this shadowy figure pushed me down the stairs, and I was in shock from the fall. I ran as fast as I could, and when I looked back, I saw the shadowy thing going back into Cathie's apartment. I hid behind a bush for half an hour before finally making it back to my place, slamming the door shut. Cathie started banging on the wall again, but this time, I had no response.  


It's important to mention that Cathie wasn't the only odd neighbor in the complex, but I'll save those stories for another time. I'm getting tired now. I might update you all tomorrow if I can.
