I took the job because it was cash, same week, no questions.

That’s the kind of job you say yes to when rent is due and your main client just “paused services” like that’s not the same thing as firing you.

The listing was through a temp staffing app, the kind with a vague thumbnail of a mop bucket and the promise of after-hours commercial cleaning. The address was a glass office building on the edge of an industrial park, one of those places that looks busy during the day and looks like a dead aquarium at night.

The message said: Arrive 8:30 PM. Ask for Trent. Bring supplies if possible.

I showed up at 8:24, because being late is the fastest way to lose a job like this, and the building parking lot was empty in a way that made my headlights feel rude. The only cars were a row of dusty fleet vehicles along the far fence. No security guard booth. No gate arm. Just a tall lobby with an auto-locking glass door and a directory board that had too many company names crammed into it.

Inside, the air smelled like cold tile and that lemon disinfectant every office uses to pretend it’s clean.

I stopped by the directory board to confirm I was in the right place and my phone lit up in my hand, not a call, just one of those “memory” notifications your phone throws at you like it’s doing you a favor.

A thread preview.

A name.

Kayla.

My thumb hovered over it like I was going to open it, like I was going to do something brave and stupid and emotional right there in a lobby that wasn’t even mine.

I didn’t. I swiped it away. The screen went dark. I put the phone back in my pocket and told myself I would deal with it later.

A man met me at the inner door with a lanyard and a key ring that looked too heavy for his belt. Late thirties maybe. Clean haircut. Polished shoes. Smile that didn’t touch his eyes.

“You here for cleaning?” he asked.

“Yeah. Matt,” I said, because it’s automatic. You introduce yourself. That’s normal.

He didn’t offer a name back. Just looked at the rolling tote behind me.

“You bring your own stuff. Good.” He pulled a clipboard from under his arm and handed it over. “Fourth floor. West wing. Two suites. Bathrooms. Break area. Trash and vacuum. Standard. They’re picky, so don’t miss corners.”

The paper was a generic checklist with boxes and little empty lines for notes. No company header. No signature line. At the bottom it said: Once finished, return supplies to lobby and exit. Do not prop doors open.

“Trent?” I asked, because the message told me to ask for Trent.

He blinked once, slow. “That’s me.”

It didn’t fit him, but whatever. People lie about their names in apps all the time.

He pointed me toward the elevators. “You can use service. Far left. Just don’t wander. Building’s under renovation. Some floors are… unsafe.”

That word landed heavy.

Unsafe.

Not closed or under construction. Unsafe like it was alive.

I pushed my cart toward the service elevator, wheels squeaking on the tile. As I passed the lobby desk, I noticed the security monitors were on, but the screens were showing a loop of the lobby at different angles. There was nobody behind the desk. A plastic plant in a corner that had dust on it thick enough to write your name.

I also noticed something else I didn’t pay enough attention to then: a gray metal box mounted near the main doors with a bundle of conduit running up into the ceiling. A little red LED on the box blinked slow and steady like a heartbeat.

Mag-lock relay, I thought absently. The kind offices use so doors can lock down when they want them to.

I took the service elevator up, alone, listening to the hum of fluorescent lights. Fourth floor. Doors opened to a hallway that looked like any corporate hallway except it was too quiet. No AC rumble. No distant conversation. Just the soft, constant sound of my own cart rolling.

The west wing suite doors were already unlocked.

Suite 4W1 first. Big open office. Rows of desks. A few framed posters about teamwork. A sad little kitchen nook with a Keurig and a stack of paper cups. The carpet had those dark traffic paths where chairs roll and people pace on phone calls.

I started working.

There’s a rhythm to cleaning that can turn your brain off if you let it. Trash first. Big stuff. Then wipe-down. Then vacuum. Bathrooms last because they’re always the worst.

I kept expecting to hear a door open somewhere. A security guard doing rounds. Another cleaner. Someone. Anything.

Nothing.

I cleaned two bathrooms that looked like nobody had used them in a week. The mirrors were spotless, which should have been a relief, but it made me feel like I was in a staged room. Like the building was dressed up for me.

I moved into the second suite and found the break area had a fridge with a sticky note that said DO NOT UNPLUG in thick marker. Someone had underlined it twice.

I didn’t touch the fridge. I wiped the counters. I emptied trash. I tried to stay inside the little world of the checklist.

Around 10:15, I ran out of trash liners and disinfectant wipes.

I’d brought a small stash in the van. I told myself I’d grab them quick, then come right back. Ten minutes. No big deal.

I rode the elevator down to the lobby and pushed through the glass doors into the parking lot.

The night air hit me like a slap, colder than it had any right to be. The industrial park beyond the lot was silent. Not even distant traffic.

My van was parked where I left it, under a light pole that flickered faintly like it couldn’t decide if it wanted to work. I jogged over and yanked the side door handle.

Locked.

I stared at it for a second, confused, then checked my pockets. Keys. Right pocket. I pulled them out and clicked unlock.

Nothing.

No beep. No flash.

I tried again. Again.

Still nothing.

My key fob battery was fine. I’d replaced it recently. I pressed lock, then unlock, then held it down. Nothing.

I stepped closer and looked through the driver’s window.

The interior light was off. The steering wheel cover was still there. My water bottle was in the cup holder. Everything looked normal except the dashboard had a faint green glow.

My phone, sitting in the little dash mount, was lit.

Not lit like a notification. Lit like the screen was on and showing something.

I leaned in, cupped my hands against the glass, and squinted.

It was a photo.

A photo of me.

Not a selfie. Not a random picture from my camera roll. A clean, centered shot of me walking across the parking lot toward the building earlier, my tote rolling behind me. Taken from an elevated angle, like from a camera on the light pole.

My throat went tight.

I tried the door again, harder, like forcing it would make reality behave.

Locked.

I stepped back, eyes darting, looking for the obvious explanation. A prank. Some security system glitch. Trent messing with me for laughs.

“Hello?” I called, loud enough to sound stupid in the empty lot.

No answer.

Then I noticed the building doors.

The main glass doors.

They were shut like before, but the small green access light by the handle was off now. No glow. No swipe indicator.

I walked up and tried the handle.

It didn’t budge.

I pulled. Then pushed. Then pulled again, harder.

Nothing.

The door didn’t flex. It felt like it was welded to the frame.

I stepped back and looked at the lobby through the glass. Same empty desk. Same looped security monitors.

But now, taped to the inside of the door at eye level, there was a sheet of printer paper that hadn’t been there when I came out.

It said, in neat black text:

DO NOT LEAVE.

I laughed once, sharp and involuntary, like my body was trying to reject the panic.

“No,” I muttered, and turned toward the side entrance near the loading area.

That door had a crash bar.

The type that’s supposed to open even if everything else fails.

I grabbed it with both hands and shoved.

It didn’t move.

Not “stuck.” Not “needs oil.”

The bar had zero give, like it had been bolted from the inside.

I shoved again, shoulder into it, and still nothing. The metal didn’t even clack.

I ran my hands through my hair and pulled out my phone.

No service.

Not one bar.

That made my stomach drop harder than the locked doors.

Because service doesn’t disappear in a parking lot like this. Even out here, you get something. A weak signal. Anything.

I walked back toward the main entrance and pressed my face closer to the glass.

The monitors behind the desk flickered.

For a split second, the looped lobby feeds vanished and one screen showed the parking lot.

It showed me.

Standing there with my cart and my tote like an idiot.

The view was from inside the building, pointed out through the glass.

Then the screens snapped back to their loop.

A quiet click came from somewhere above the doors.

A speaker.

And the intercom, which I hadn’t noticed before because the lobby ceiling was too high and the lights too bright, crackled to life.

“Matt,” a voice said.

My skin went cold.

Not my full name. Just my first name, said like it belonged to someone else now.

I backed up from the door like it had burned me.

“Who is this?” I called into the empty lot, because my brain was still trying to treat it like a normal situation. Like somebody would respond like a person.

The intercom didn’t answer my question.

“You wanted a job with no questions,” the voice said. “Now you’re going to answer one.”

“I just clean,” I said. “Open the door. I’m leaving.”

The intercom crackled again.

“Return inside.”

The little gray box by the doors — the one with the blinking LED — made a soft, sharp sound, like a relay switching. The green access light blinked on.

Then, slowly, the door unlatched with a mechanical clunk I could feel through the glass.

I stared at it like it was a trap.

Because it was.

But the other part of my brain, the part that hates being stuck outside in the cold with no service and a locked van, pushed me forward.

I grabbed my cart handle and stepped back into the lobby.

The door shut behind me with a solid thunk.

The latch engaged. I heard it. That heavy, final click.

I turned immediately and grabbed the handle.

It wouldn’t move.

The access light was off again.

The gray relay box clicked once more, neat and final.

I spun toward the security desk.

Still empty.

But now there was an envelope on the counter. Plain white. My name printed on it in clean, block letters.

MATT.

I didn’t touch it for a second. My hands hovered over it like it might bite.

Then the intercom clicked again, and the voice lowered, closer, like it knew exactly where I was standing.

“Open it.”

I looked up at the ceiling. “Is Trent doing this?” I asked. “Where is he?”

No answer. Just that quiet, patient silence.

I ripped the envelope open.

Inside was a stack of glossy photos.

Not printed on cheap office paper. Actual photo prints, like you’d pick up from a pharmacy.

First photo: me arriving in the parking lot. My tote. My face turned toward the building.

Second: me in the lobby, talking to Trent. That angle was from behind the directory board, low and close. Too close.

Third: me in the service elevator, alone, looking down at my phone. Taken from above, like from a camera I didn’t notice.

Fourth: me on the fourth floor, bent over a trash can. My shirt riding up slightly at the back. Under it, handwritten in red ink:

WORKER.

My stomach lurched.

I flipped through them faster, trying to find the end, like the end would make it make sense.

There were more.

Me in the bathroom, washing my hands.

Me wiping the counter in the break area.

Me outside, tugging on the van handle.

And the last one.

Me, right now, in the lobby, holding the photos, looking up.

The timestamp printed in the corner read 10:19 PM.

My hands shook so hard I nearly dropped them.

“You’ve been watching me,” I said.

The intercom crackled, soft like a laugh that didn’t quite form.

“We’ve been documenting,” the voice said. “That’s what you do for a living, isn’t it? You make things look like nothing happened.”

The elevator dinged behind me.

I spun.

The service elevator doors were open.

Inside was a plastic storage bin like the kind people use for moving. On top of it was my roll of trash liners and my disinfectant wipes. Stuff I knew was in my van.

A second envelope sat beside them.

The intercom clicked.

“Take your supplies.”

I didn’t want to step into the elevator. I didn’t want to walk into any enclosed space I didn’t control.

But the lobby felt like a fish tank. Bright. Exposed. And the elevator was sitting there like an open mouth.

I walked in, grabbed the supplies, grabbed the envelope, and backed out.

The doors didn’t close. They stayed open like they were waiting.

I tore the second envelope open.

Inside was a single card, heavy stock, printed like a business invitation.

On the front it said:

YOU CLEAN UP AFTER PEOPLE.

On the back:

TONIGHT, CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF.

Below that, in smaller text:

Return to 4W2. Close the door. Sit in the chair facing the conference room screen.

My chest tightened. “No,” I said, reflexive. “No. I’m leaving.”

The intercom responded immediately.

“You tried that.”

“I didn’t have a choice.”

The voice paused, like it was considering that.

“People say that a lot,” it said. “They’re usually wrong.”

The lobby lights dimmed slightly.

Not a full blackout. Just a soft lowering, enough to make the corners feel deeper.

The elevator doors stayed open.

The only clear path forward was the one it told me.

So I pushed my cart back into the elevator and rode up.

The ride felt longer than it should have. Every floor number lit up like a countdown.

Fourth floor. Doors opened.

The hallway looked the same, but it didn’t feel the same. The air was colder. The overhead lights buzzed faintly, like they were underpowered.

I pushed the cart to 4W2.

The door was ajar.

I put my hand on it and hesitated. I listened.

Nothing.

I nudged it open.

Inside, the suite was… different.

Not rearranged. Not obviously. But my brain noticed small things like it was searching for danger.

Every desk chair was pushed in perfectly. The monitors were off. The kitchen area was spotless, unnaturally so, like it had been cleaned by someone who didn’t understand what normal clean looks like.

And on the far wall, where a motivational poster had been earlier, there was now a grid of photos taped up with clear packing tape.

At least twenty.

All of me.

Me walking. Me wiping. Me looking over my shoulder. Me checking my phone. Me bending to pick up a trash bag.

Different angles. Different distances. Some taken from ceiling corners. Some taken from inside drawers, low and hidden.

The same red handwritten label appeared under several:

WORKER. WORKER. WORKER.

Then, under one photo of me pausing by the window, staring out at the lot, it said:

RUNNER.

I felt my face heat. Like being accused.

The conference room screen at the center of the suite flickered to life. A projector hummed softly.

A video feed appeared.

It was the parking lot outside.

My van in the center, lonely under the flickering light.

And beside it, barely in frame, was a person.

A figure standing near the passenger side, head turned toward the building.

I couldn’t see their face. They were too far away. But they were there.

The intercom voice came through ceiling speakers in the suite now, cleaner and louder.

“Sit.”

There was a chair placed dead center facing the screen. One of the rolling office chairs.

The wheels had been removed.

That detail hit me harder than it should have.

Someone took the wheels off.

Someone had time.

I stood there for a second, hands clenched on the cart handle, and then I did what it told me because I didn’t know what else to do.

I sat.

The chair didn’t roll. It didn’t shift.

It felt like the room had been built around me.

The video feed zoomed slightly on the parking lot.

The figure by my van moved out of frame.

Then my van’s interior light turned on.

The door wasn’t opening. The light was coming on like someone inside it had flipped it.

My mouth went numb.

The intercom voice softened.

“Matt, you work nights. You work alone. You take jobs that ask for no questions.”

I said nothing.

“Tonight, you will answer questions.”

The conference room screen changed.

A slideshow.

First image: my work profile photo from the app. Old. Slightly blurry. Me smiling because you’re supposed to smile in those.

Second image: a screenshot of a text thread. No phone number. No last names. Just a name at the top.

Kayla.

A message bubble: Are you coming home? I’m scared. I heard something outside.

My chest tightened, sharp. I leaned forward without meaning to.

The next slide.

My reply.

Can’t. Busy. Lock the door.

Then another message from her, later.

It’s in the house.

No response from me after that. Just empty space.

“You did not answer,” the voice said.

I tried to speak and nothing came out right away. When it did, it was rough. “What is this.”

“You clean,” the voice said. “You clean up messes. You wipe away evidence. You close doors behind you and pretend you did not see what was on the floor.”

The screen shifted again. Another image.

An office hallway.

A dark stain on carpet.

Not graphic. Not clear. Still enough to make my stomach roll because I knew what it meant.

I recognized the carpet pattern. I recognized the framed art on the walls.

A job from last winter. An office suite where someone had died over the weekend. I’d been hired to clean after the removal. That’s what they called it.

I had walked into that suite and seen the stain and not asked questions. I had done my job.

I gripped the chair seat so hard my knuckles ached.

“I didn’t do anything,” I said, but it sounded weak even to me.

The intercom crackled softly.

“You did nothing,” it agreed. “That is the point.”

The lights dimmed another notch.

Then, with a mechanical clunk, the conference room door across the suite shut by itself.

Not slammed. Just closed. Like a reminder.

A timer appeared on the screen.

15:00

The intercom voice returned to business.

“Your van contains what you need to leave. The door will not open until you complete one task.”

My throat went tight. “What task.”

The screen switched to a live feed of the suite.

I saw myself sitting there from a ceiling corner angle.

And behind me, taped to the wall of photos, was a new print I hadn’t noticed.

It was Kayla. Standing in a doorway. Phone in her hand. Eyes wide.

The timestamp in the corner was from that night.

I felt something inside me twist.

The intercom said, “You ignored a call for help.”

The timer ticked down.

14:32

“You do not get to ignore this one.”

A vent cover near the baseboards on the far side of the suite rattled softly.

Once.

Then again.

Not like loose metal. Like something pushing from inside.

My skin went cold.

“Complete the task,” the voice said, “or remain here until the building closes you permanently.”

The vent rattled again.

I stood up so fast the chair legs scraped the carpet.

“Stop,” I said into the air. “Stop doing that.”

The voice didn’t change.

“Task one is simple,” it said. “Tell the truth.”

The screen displayed one line:

WHY DO YOU TAKE THE NO QUESTIONS JOBS?

My mouth was dry. My heart pounded so hard it made my vision pulse.

I stared at the question.

I let the seconds pass because I didn’t want to give it what it wanted. Because something in me got stubborn, the same ugly stubborn I use to keep working when I’m exhausted. The same stubborn that makes me swallow things instead of saying them out loud.

The intercom didn’t nag. It didn’t repeat itself.

It just let the timer keep shrinking.

13:51

13:50

13:49

The vent cover scraped, slow and patient, like a fingernail testing an edge.

I pushed the cart toward the suite door instead. If it wanted answers, it could chase me for them.

The moment my hand wrapped around the door handle, it jerked.

Not pulled by a person. Yanked by something mechanical with no hesitation.

The door swung shut so fast the air snapped.

My left hand was still there.

The edge caught my fingers against the metal frame and crushed them in a hard, clean bite. I felt it in my teeth. A flash of white pain so sharp my knees buckled.

I made a sound I’m not proud of, something between a shout and a gasp.

The door opened again immediately, like it had only been closing to take its payment.

I stared at my hand.

Two fingers were already swelling. Blood ran from a split along the side of my ring finger and down to my palm, bright against my skin, dripping onto the carpet in slow, stupid drops.

The intercom crackled, calm as ever.

“You chose silence,” it said. “Silence has consequences.”

I pressed my bleeding hand into my shirt, biting down hard. I could feel my pulse thumping inside the cut, hot and steady.

The timer didn’t stop.

It kept counting.

13:12

The vent cover rattled once, satisfied.

I backed up, shaking, and sat again because my legs suddenly didn’t feel like mine.

The screen held the question like it was patient.

WHY DO YOU TAKE THE NO QUESTIONS JOBS?

My mouth tasted like metal. My hand throbbed so badly it made my vision shimmer at the edges.

I swallowed and forced myself to look at the words, not the door, not the vent, not the live feed, because I couldn’t fight a building. I couldn’t out-stubborn a system that could slam a door whenever it wanted.

“Because I need money,” I said, voice rough.

The intercom was silent for a beat.

The timer continued.

12:41

“That is not the full truth,” the voice said.

I clenched my jaw, pain spiking when I tightened my injured hand. “Because I’m desperate.”

Silence. Then:

“Still not the full truth.”

Rage flared, hot and stupid. “Because I don’t want to think,” I snapped. “Because if I keep moving, I don’t have to sit in my apartment and remember things. Because if I’m scrubbing floors at midnight, I don’t have to be a person.”

The vent cover stopped rattling.

The intercom stayed silent long enough that the quiet filled my ears.

Then the screen changed.

A new line:

WHO DID YOU NOT SAVE?

My throat tightened so hard it hurt.

The timer read:

11:58

I stared at the words until they blurred.

I swallowed and forced the words out.

“Kayla,” I said. “Her name is Kayla.”

The speaker crackled once, like it approved the use of a real name.

I kept going because stopping felt worse.

“She texted me and I didn’t go,” I said. “I told myself it wasn’t real. Or it wasn’t my problem. Or it was too late. I don’t know. I didn’t go. I didn’t answer. I did nothing.”

My voice broke on the last part, and I hated it because it sounded like I was trying to win sympathy from a ceiling.

The lights flickered.

Somewhere deep in the building, something clicked.

The timer froze.

11:51

Then disappeared.

The suite’s main door unlocked with a soft mechanical sound.

I didn’t celebrate. I didn’t feel relief.

Because the vent cover, which had stopped rattling, slid half an inch sideways on its own.

Like something inside had been waiting for permission.

The intercom voice returned, almost gentle.

“Task one complete,” it said. “Do you want to leave now, Matt, or do you want to see what your work has cleaned away.”

I stared at the vent.

A thin, dark line appeared at the edge, like a claw tip or a finger, testing the opening.

My stomach rolled.

“I want to leave,” I whispered.

The intercom didn’t argue. “Then return to the lobby. Walk. Do not run.”

I grabbed my cart and shoved it toward the door, holding my injured hand tight to my chest so it wouldn’t bump anything.

As I exited the suite, I heard the vent cover scrape again behind me.

Like something disappointed.

The hallway lights buzzed as I pushed the cart toward the elevator. My mind screamed at me to sprint, to get away, to not obey some calm voice that had put my life on a timer.

But the do not run part stuck in my head like a hook.

I walked. Fast. Not running.

The elevator was waiting, doors open like before.

I stepped in and hit the lobby button with my good hand. My injured fingers kept twitching like they were trying to climb out of my skin.

As the doors slid shut, I caught one last glimpse down the fourth-floor hallway.

At the far end, where the lights didn’t quite reach, something moved.

Low to the ground. Quick and smooth.

A shape that didn’t match any normal body.

The elevator doors closed fully.

My breathing came loud in the small space.

The ride down felt too slow.

When the doors opened to the lobby, it looked the same as before, bright and empty.

But the security desk monitor loop had changed.

All screens now showed live feeds.

Parking lot. Hallways. Elevator interior. Me, standing in the lobby with one hand pressed to my chest, blood smeared along my shirt.

The envelope on the desk was gone. In its place was a single key fob, black, with a cheap label-maker tag that read:

VAN

The intercom clicked.

“Take it,” the voice said. “Leave.”

I snatched the fob, went to the main doors, and pressed unlock.

The green access light came on.

The gray relay box clicked.

The door unlatched.

Cold air rushed in like the building exhaled.

I stepped outside and the door shut behind me.

The latch clicked.

I didn’t turn around.

I walked to my van like my legs were trying to forget how.

The key fob worked now. The van unlocked with a cheerful beep that made me want to scream.

I yanked the door open and climbed in, shaking so hard I fumbled the key into the ignition twice.

The van started.

The headlights cut across the lot.

And in that cone of light, I saw something that made my hands go numb.

On the building’s glass lobby doors, from the inside, someone had taped up a new photo.

It was me, sitting in the van, eyes wide, one hand clamped around the steering wheel, the other wrapped in my shirt with blood soaking through.

The timestamp in the corner read 10:46 PM.

I slammed the van into reverse and backed out fast, tires squealing on asphalt.

As I turned to exit the lot, the intercom speaker outside the building crackled one last time.

Not loud. Not dramatic.

Just enough to reach me through the closed window.

“Matt,” the voice said, and it sounded almost satisfied. “Keep your phone on tonight.”

I drove until I hit the first gas station with lights and other people and cameras that felt real.

Then I sat in my van shaking with my hands locked on the steering wheel, trying not to look at the smeared red streak I’d left on the leather.

My phone, which had shown no service all night, buzzed.

One bar appeared.

Then two.

A text came in from an unknown number.

No name.

No profile picture.

Just a single image attachment.

I stared at it for a long time before I tapped it, because part of me still wanted to believe this could end if I didn’t look.

The photo opened.

It was my apartment hallway.

My door.

Taken from above, like from a ceiling corner.

And taped to my door, right at eye level, was a clean, glossy photo of me in the lobby holding the stack of pictures.

Under it, written in red ink, was one word:

WORKER.

And below that, smaller:

ANSWER THIS TIME.
