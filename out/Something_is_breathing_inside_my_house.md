I'm writing this in the dark, under my covers, phone brightness turned all the way down. I don't know what else to do.

This started three nights ago. I live alone in a small, one-story house at the edge of town. It’s quiet, peaceful even. Or it was. I don't scare easily. I grew up with two older brothers who made it their mission to toughen me up. I’ve watched horror movies alone since I was ten. I sleep with the windows open. I don't jump at creaks or groans. But this... this is different.

The first night, I thought I was dreaming. I woke up around 2:17 AM. Not because of a noise, but because of a feeling—like I was being watched. I sat up and listened. Silence. Then I heard it: a slow, deep inhale. Followed by an even slower exhale. It was rhythmic, almost... deliberate. Like someone was trying to make sure I heard it. But the sound wasn't coming from outside. It was in the house.

I grabbed the baseball bat I keep by my bed and walked through every room. Nothing. I even checked under the bed and in the closet, just to feel like I wasn't going crazy. But the sound had stopped. I chalked it up to a weird dream and went back to sleep.

Night two was worse.

This time, the breathing started before I even fell asleep. I was brushing my teeth and heard it—the same inhale, exhale. I froze. It was coming from the hallway. I turned the bathroom light off and waited, toothbrush still in hand. The breathing continued. Closer. Then it stopped. I stayed in that bathroom for what felt like hours. When I finally stepped into the hall, there was nothing. No sound. No movement.

I left every light in the house on that night.

Tonight is night three. I tried playing music. I tried falling asleep to TV. Nothing worked. Around 1:30, everything went quiet. My phone started glitching. Spotify stopped playing. My TV went black. Then the breathing started again. Only this time... it was right outside my bedroom door.

It sounded bigger than before. Like whoever—or whatever—it is, is getting closer. It stood there for almost an hour. Breathing. I didn't move. I couldn't. And then...

The doorknob turned.

Just slightly. Just enough to make me know it wasn’t the wind.

I whispered for it to go away. I don’t know why. I think I just needed to say something. That was ten minutes ago. The breathing stopped, but I haven’t heard footsteps. It didn't walk away. It didn't open the door.

It's just quiet now.

Too quiet.

Earlier today, I bought a couple cheap cameras off Amazon and set them up—one facing the front door, one in the hallway, and one outside my bedroom. I checked the footage before bed.

Everything looked normal, except for one thing: a section of the hallway, right by my bedroom door, was more pixelated than the rest. Like a bad compression artifact, but it didn’t make sense. The lighting was the same. The other parts of the hallway were clear. But this one spot, right where I keep hearing the breathing... it shimmered, almost like static. I rewound the footage. Same distortion. Frame after frame.

Nothing moved. But something was there.

I told my brother about everything. He’s the oldest, the skeptic. The one who always said ghosts were just drafts and paranoia. He laughed at first, but I guess I sounded serious enough because he offered to drive down and spend the night. I didn’t argue.

He got here about an hour ago. We set up in the living room, both of us with bats by our sides like it was some kind of sleepover from hell. We didn’t talk much. I think part of him wanted to prove me wrong. I almost hoped he would.

He dozed off on the couch a while ago. But here’s the thing: there’s breathing again. Deep, steady. Louder than before. And it’s coming from somewhere near the kitchen.

But every time I glance over at my brother, he's completely still.

Not snoring.

Not shifting.

Just still.

And yet... the breathing doesn’t stop.

That was hours ago. I must have fallen asleep with the bat in my hand. When I woke up, the sun was starting to rise. My brother was gone.

No note. No message. His car keys were still on the counter. His shoes by the door. I checked the bathroom, the kitchen, even the crawl space under the house. Nothing. Just gone.

I checked the cameras.

At 3:08 AM, the front door cam glitched out completely—static, then black. The hallway cam flickered but stayed on. At 3:11, I saw the shimmer again—the same pixelated stretch by my bedroom door. And then, for just one frame, it stretched. Like something moving through it.

The weirdest part? There was no footage of my brother leaving. No sign of the door opening. No shadows. Just the shimmer growing, distorting the entire frame, then vanishing.

And now, tonight—just now—the breathing has returned. But it’s not in the hallway.

It’s coming from above me.

I don’t have an upstairs.

I'm posting this because if something happens to me, someone should know. I'm not crazy. Something is breathing in my house.

And I think it’s still here.
