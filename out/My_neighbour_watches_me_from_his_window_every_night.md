I’m not even sure why I’m writing this. Maybe typing it out will help me make sense of it. Or maybe I just need someone to know in case... well, in case something happens tonight. I don’t know. All I know is that I can’t be the only one who’s seen him.

I first met him the day I moved in. It was one of those humid late-summer afternoons. I was hauling the last of my boxes into the elevator when he appeared beside me—thin, wiry frame, gray hair slicked back against his scalp, and eyes that seemed just a little too wide.

“New tenant, huh?” he asked. His smile was tight, like it hurt to stretch his lips.

“Yeah,” I said, shifting the box in my arms.

He tilted his head slightly, like he was considering something. “Hope you like it here,” he said, holding that smile. “Some of us stay longer than we should.”

Before I could ask what he meant, the elevator doors opened and he stepped out. I shrugged it off at the time. But that wasn’t the last time I saw him.

A few weeks later, I ran into him again in the basement laundry room. I was loading my clothes into the machine when I felt someone standing too close behind me. I turned—and there he was.

“Midday laundry, huh?” His smile was thinner this time, his gaze a little too fixed. “Guess you’re not ready for the night yet. That’s when he comes.”

I forced a nervous laugh. “Who comes?”

His eyes glinted with something unreadable. “The one who collects. You’ll meet him when it's your time.”

I grabbed my basket and rushed out, heart hammering. I told myself he was just a creepy old man trying to get a rise out of me. But I couldn't shake the feeling that he meant every word.

The third time was late one night. I’d gone out with friends and was heading home around 1 a.m. The lobby was empty as I stepped into the elevator. Just as the doors began to close, a hand shot between them.

It was him.

He stepped inside, standing too close despite the empty space. His smile was gone now, replaced with something... expectant. The elevator hummed as we ascended, the air thick and still. Then, halfway to my floor, the lights flickered—and went out.

Darkness swallowed us. The elevator stopped.

“You feel that?” His voice was a whisper in the dark. “He’s close. He always comes when the lights go out. Some souls are taken quick. Others... he likes to savor.”

I pressed the emergency button, my pulse hammering.

“But you... oh, he’s been waiting for you. He likes the ones who fight.”

The air grew heavier, like something unseen had entered the space with us. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears, deafening in the silence.

Then the lights flickered back on. The elevator jolted upward.

And he was gone.

After that, I didn’t see him again. Not for almost a year. I convinced myself I’d imagined it. But last week... he came back.

At first, it was just a glimpse—standing in the window of an apartment across the street. His face partially obscured, but I knew it was him.

Every night since then, he’s been there. Same window. Same expression. Grinning. Watching.

Tonight is the seventh night.

At 3 a.m., he finally moved.

I watched as he stepped away from the window and vanished into the apartment’s shadows. My breath fogged against the glass as I leaned closer.

Then I saw him again.

He was on the street.

Crossing the road.

Heading for my building.

He’s inside now. I heard the lobby door close. I don’t know what floor he’s on. I don’t know if he’s taking the stairs or the elevator.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. If something happens to me tonight... someone needs to know. Just in case.

Because I think tonight... it’s my turn.
