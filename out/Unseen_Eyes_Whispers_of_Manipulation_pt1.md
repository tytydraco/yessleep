I had always felt like an outsider, even in my own skin. Growing up in a conservative area in Virginia, I learned to hide the parts of myself that didn’t fit the mold. By day, I was just another 18 year old white guy, standing at 5’8” and weighing only 122 pounds. It was a constant battle to project an extra layer of masculinity, a performance I felt compelled to maintain. I played the part, joining in on conversations about girls and pretending to enjoy football and basketball with the other guys. I participated in their banter and tried to fit in, but inside, I felt like a stranger among them.

With my striking blue eyes and delicate, feminine features, I often drew unwanted attention, which only intensified my desire to conform. This pressure to uphold a facade weighed heavily on me, reinforcing the mask I wore every day. By night, I transformed into Lavinia, a glamorous version of myself that existed only in the shadows of social media. I posted pictures on X, formerly known as Twitter, dressed as a girl, showcasing my sparkly dresses, sexy lingerie, and bold makeup. It was my escape, my secret life that allowed me to express who I truly was without fear of judgment.

One evening, as I lay in bed scrolling through my notifications, I noticed a DM pop up. The username was unfamiliar, but the message chilled me to the bone: **“Hey, [my real name].”** My heart raced. I used an alter ego on that account, a name no one could trace back to me. I initially thought it was a prank from a friend trying to freak me out. I typed back hesitantly, **“Hey… who is this?”**

The conversation started off innocently enough, almost playful, but as the back-and-forth continued, it quickly took a sinister turn.

**Anonymous:** *“Just someone who admires your style. The pink dress really suits you.”*

**Me:** *“Thanks? But I don’t know you…”*

**Anonymous:** *“Oh, but I know you. I see you every day.”*

The air in my room felt thick, suffocating. A sense of dread settled over me, creeping into my thoughts like a shadow.

**Me:** *“What do you mean?”*

**Anonymous:** *“You should really be more careful. Not everyone is as friendly as they seem.”*

I began to feel a gnawing anxiety, the kind that twists your stomach into knots. A shiver ran down my spine as I realized this person was watching me. I decided to block the account, thinking it would put an end to it. But then, another message came in, this time from a different account.

My heart sank as I opened the DM. It contained photos of me… real pictures, taken from outside my house, as I walked home from my friend’s house, even shots of me at the park. The anonymous user didn’t stop there; they had personal information, details about my life that I hadn’t shared with anyone on that account. The fear washed over me like a cold wave, and I felt paralyzed. No one should have known these things.

**Anonymous:** *“Nice outfit today. That tight blue shirt really popped against your skin.”*

**Me:** *“Who the fuck are you?!”*

**Anonymous:** *“Someone who cares. Someone who sees you.”*

I blocked that account too, but the messages kept coming. Each time I blocked one, another would pop up. I realized that I was being hunted, and there was no escaping it. After a sleepless night filled with paranoia, I decided to deactivate my account altogether. I couldn’t risk anyone finding out who I was, especially not my family. The thought of those pictures leaking sent me into a spiral of anxiety, my mind racing with worst case scenarios.

Weeks passed, and the feeling of being watched only intensified. I couldn’t shake the sensation that unseen eyes were following me everywhere. Whether I was walking to the corner store or just standing in my yard, I felt like I was constantly under surveillance, a puppet dancing on strings I couldn’t see.

Then one afternoon, I came home to find a small taped up box sitting on my front porch. My heart raced; none of my family had seen it, and it felt as if whoever left it knew exactly when I’d be home. The label read, *“From a dear friend, to Lavinia.”* My blood ran cold. I was certain it was the same person from the anonymous account that had tormented me online.

I opened the box, and inside lay a note written in jagged handwriting, alongside two lipsticks (a red and a pink one). The message sent shivers down my spine: 
“I love seeing your day. I noticed how you walked to the park on Tuesday and that you wore those white short shorts on Saturday. It looked lovely on you. Reactivate your account immediately.”

Fear clawed at me, leaving me breathless. I felt like a marionette, and the strings were pulled taut. Against my better judgment, I reactivated my account. I was desperate to understand what this person wanted from me. I messaged the anonymous account: *“What do you want from me?”*

The reply came almost instantly: *“Where’s the fun in that?”*

I stared at the screen, anxiety bubbling in my chest as I waited for more, each second stretching into eternity.

**Me:** *“Are you going to just keep fucking with me?”*

**Anonymous:** *“Fucking with you? No, my dear, I’m just watching. You’re the one who’s been playing games.”*

**Me:** *“What do you mean?”*

**Anonymous:** *“You think hiding will keep you safe? You’re not invisible, Lavinia. I see you.”*

I felt a wave of dread wash over me. It was as if this person was peeling back the layers of my carefully constructed facade, exposing my vulnerabilities with chilling precision.

**Me:** *“I’m not hiding! I’m just trying to live my life!”*

**Anonymous:** *“You could live it so much more freely if you just listened to me.”*

I hesitated, fear mingling with curiosity, the kind that burrowed into my mind and refused to let go.

**Me:** *“What do you want from me?”*

**Anonymous:** *“Let’s play a little game, shall we?”*

**Me:** *“What kind of game?”* 

**Anonymous:** *“Complete a task for me. Take a sexy picture of yourself in a pink dress, and send it to me.”*

**Me:** *“No! I won’t do that!”*

**Anonymous:** *“Then I’ll show everyone your secrets. I have more than just those pictures. I know things.”*

**Me:** *“What do you mean by ‘things’?”*

**Anonymous:** *“Your little secrets, like how you used to sneak out at night to hook up with men.”*

Panic surged through me, and my fingers trembled as I typed, the weight of each word pressing down like a physical burden.

**Me:** *“Please stop it! That’s not true!”*

**Anonymous:** *“Oh, but it is. And you know it. I’ll be keeping an eye on you, Lavinia. One way or another, you’ll do what I say.”*

The threat hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. My mind raced as I considered my options. I couldn’t let them win; I couldn’t let my life be controlled by someone lurking in the shadows.

**Me:** *“Fine, I’ll do it. But what else do you want?”*

**Anonymous:** *“Good. After that, I have more fun tasks. You’ll enjoy this game, trust me.”*

**Me:** *“Why are you doing this?”*

**Anonymous:** *“Because it’s entertaining. Watching you squirm, knowing you’re powerless… it’s delightful.”*

I felt the weight of the box on my conscience, the ultimatum hanging over me like a dark cloud. The message instructed me to wear the pink dress I’d posted in one of my photos and take a picture in it, sharing it back to the anonymous account.

With shaky hands, I pulled the pink dress from my closet. It felt like a betrayal of myself, but I had no choice. I didn’t want to know what the “consequences” would be if I refused. The fabric felt foreign against my skin, a reminder of the sinister game I was now part of.

I stood in front of the mirror, examining the reflection staring back at me. The fabric hugged my body, and for a moment, I felt a mix of thrill and dread swirling in my stomach, an intoxicating cocktail of fear and adrenaline.

Taking a deep breath, I snapped a photo and sent it, the caption reading,

**Me:** *“I did it. Now what?”*

**Anonymous:** *“Wow, you look stunning. Like you were made for it.”*

**Me:** *“Just tell me what you want from me!”*

**Anonymous:** *“Patience, Lavinia. You did well today. But remember, this is just the beginning.”*

**Me:** *“What the fuck do you want from me?”*

**Anonymous:** *“I want you to embrace who you are. It’s liberating, isn’t it?”*

**Me:** *“This is insane! You can’t keep doing this to me!”*

**Anonymous:** *“Oh, but I can. And I will. Tomorrow will be even more fun.”*

The threat loomed ominously, wrapping around my chest like a vice.

**Me:** *“What do you mean?”*

Anonymous: “You’ll find out soon enough. Remember, Lavinia, you can never escape me. I’m always right around the corner.”

The conversation ended, leaving me breathless. I stood frozen in front of the mirror, my heart pounding as I contemplated the absurdity and terror of the situation.

I felt trapped, ensnared in a game I never asked to join. The stakes were alarmingly high, and the fear of exposure pressed me into a corner. I had to play along to protect myself, but as I gazed at the screen, a chilling realization washed over me: I wasn’t just fighting for my secret life; I was battling for my freedom against an unseen predator.

I was Lavinia, the vibrant, confident version of myself that thrived in the shadows of social media. But with each message, I grew terrified of what I was becoming a pawn in someone else’s twisted game. The thrill of self expression was overshadowed by the dread of being watched, manipulated by someone who reveled in my fear. I longed to embrace my identity, yet I felt increasingly vulnerable, caught between the desire for acceptance and the anxiety of an unseen eye scrutinizing my every move.
