I’m back again. Bill hasn’t gotten to me yet, though he’s tried. If you’re a bit confused by that, long story short, I work the midnight shift at a fast food restaurant that has some weird rules. Last time I didn’t follow them the shadow man (known around the store as Bill) tried to steal my soul

 or order some chicken tenders. I didn’t really stop to ask.

Anyway, I said I would write down if I encountered any other “visitors” of Smiley’s, and boy, have I.

At around 3 AM, I was waiting at the drive-thru window, looking at my phone, when I heard a tap. I looked up and almost jumped out of my skin. All I could see were a pair of long, gangly legs that looked like they were wearing what was left of suit pants. The tapping continued, and the source came into my view—a long, slender, grey hand. I desperately wanted to ignore this “customer,” but ignoring it would be breaking one of Ryan’s rules, and I did NOT want a repeat of last time. Slowly pulling the drive-thru window back, I said in my best "I love working here and am definitely not freaking out" voice,

“Welcome to Smiley’s! What can I do for you today?”

A voice that reminded me of my chain-smoking grandma, only deeper, answered, “Can I have the 3 Combo?” Odd choice—apparently even freakishly large, lanky men still enjoy chicken nuggets, but who am I to judge.

“That’ll be $8.99,” I said hesitantly. I didn’t really know how he was planning on paying, but at this point in the job, it was almost automatic to say it.

“Keep the change,” Mr. Lanky said (that’s what I’ve decided to call him until Ryan tells me what his name is), and handed me fifteen dollars and sixty-five cents. I have zero clue where he got this money, and honestly, I don’t care. He tipped me better than the normal customers do.

I went to the fryers and started cooking fries while getting his “nuggets” ready. The container at the bottom of the warmer was full of odd pieces of meat (if you could call it that), and I tried to find the most nugget-like ones. I ended up picking what resembled a chicken heart, a few toes of some kind, and a fish eyeball—which I’m pretty sure blinked at me when I picked it up. With Mr. Lanky’s order packed up and put in a bag, I braced myself and opened the window again.

“Here’s your order. Have a Smiley day!” The cheerfulness was really struggling.

Mr. Lanky reached down and plucked the bag with two of his long, gangly fingers, and began to walk away. I quickly closed the window, and with a sigh of relief, released all the tension that had built up in my body. Taking a quick glance, I saw a car pulling up into the drive-thru. I turned my headset on.

“Welcome to Smiley’s! What can I do for you today?” I answered. This time, the joy of seeing a human being made it easy to be cheerful.

“Uh yeah, can I get a 2 Combo, with a large fry please?” the voice asked through the drive-thru headset. As they asked, I heard banging coming from the freezer.

“Sorry, we’re… out right now.”

 

That overall was on the tamer side of encounters I’ve had. After I told Ryan about Mr. Lanky, he told me his “official” name was Nuggets (I wasn’t the only one to notice his ordering habits)

Ryan also started telling me about some of our other customers and the best ways to serve them. He gave me a pamphlet with the words “Smiley’s Special Guest Reference” on it. He told me it had a list of customers and how to interact with them. I skimmed through it, looking for our friend Nugget on there—and yep, I saw him. Just the name though. None of the entries have pictures, not surprised. The only thing to keep in mind for him is to not look at his face and give him an eyeball if you have one. (I knew the eye was a good choice.)

I decided to keep the pamphlet with me next to the drive-thru window. Ryan said if anything weird started to happen when someone was ordering, just check the pamphlet. I tried to read through it, but there are a LOT of entries, and my head starts hurting after reading two or three. If anything unusual (or at least more unusual than normal) happens, I’ll use the pamphlet and figure out what to do.

Thankfully, I didn’t need the pamphlet for a few days after Ryan gave it to me. The shift was going smoothly—the floors were swept, sauces stocked, read the Latin sheet into the drive-thru headset, and wrote down what we were low on.

The store was extra slow, with no one ordering for the past three hours, and the time was dragging on. I sat in the kitchen, watching the drive-thru cameras, begging for something. (My freezer buddy hadn’t banged on the door all night, and I thought he might not be feeling good.) Then the cameras turned black. Blinking and rubbing my eyes, I looked again. Absolutely black. I looked out the window—same thing. A pitch-black void.

I got up and walked to the drive-thru window and could hear something coming from the drive-thru headset (it squeezes my head, so I take it off if no one’s ordering). The sound coming from the headset was pure static.

The pamphlet was in the corner of my vision. I picked it up and skimmed through it, looking for anything that would help. I saw:  
“If you hear a dead relative”—nope.  
“Mannequin-like appearance”—not helpful.  
“Static in the headset and pitch black outside”—there we go.

I skimmed it, trying to figure out what to do. The pamphlet said, “Bag a 6 Combo, large fry,” and that’s what I did. Bracing myself, I pulled open the window and went to hand the order out—but forgot 6 Combos come with 4 tenders, not 3. Quickly, I turned back around and threw the extra tender in (I assumed the black void wouldn’t mind), and my eyes glanced over the pamphlet again, still laying half-open.

Without even particularly focusing on anything, I noticed the final sentence: “Whatever you do, do not reach outside. Simply throw the order out the window.”

A shiver raced up my spine. I didn’t want to find out what would have happened if I reached my hand out like I was about to. Going back, I carefully pulled open the window, my hand shaking. I could feel beads of sweat forming on my forehead. With a small swing, I tossed the bag through the window.

It vanished the second it crossed the barrier between inside and outside. Not gradually like it was lost in the dark or fog—it vanished instantly. No sound. I slammed the window shut and backed away, praying that the eternal void outside didn’t want extra sauces.

A few seconds passed, and in the blink of an eye, my regular view outside the window returned. But it was bright—too bright for 1 AM. I checked the clock, and it read 5:59 AM.

How? Making the order barely took me ten minutes, and I KNOW it was near 1 when this ordeal started. A voice snapped me out of my confusion.

“If you got everything done, you’re all good to go!” a female voice said.

“I think it’s all done. Sorry if I missed anything,” I answered hesitantly, turning to see Mandy, one of my coworkers. She was on the shorter side, around 5’3”, with brown curly hair and a lightly freckled face. I had met her before, usually when she took over for me in the morning.

“Don’t worry about it. You looked like you had a long night,” Mandy said, looking at me with her usual one-dimpled grin. I wanted to mention what happened but remembered that Ryan told me it’s best not to tell the day shift workers about the “unusual” things—something about “No point in stressing them out.”

I quickly grabbed my stuff, making sure to get the pamphlet. I had a feeling I was going to need this thing if I wanted to make it to the end of my shifts in the future.

That’s all I have time for. I wrote this during my shift, and I have a few things to do before I clock out—and the lights are flickering again.

Good ol’ Bill is wanting to say hi.
