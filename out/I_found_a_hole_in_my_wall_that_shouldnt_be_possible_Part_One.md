*Preface*:

*I don’t want anyone contacting my family, my work or anything. I can’t have anyone telling them about what’s happened or any stupid ideas that I might be unwell. For this reason, I’ll be using a pseudonym for all parties involved. Please respect my privacy and understand that I am not crazy. Everything I tell you is real. Everything I tell you is still ongoing. My wife told me to write down everything I could remember about it, but I only noticed the hole around about three days ago. I’ll try and write down everything I can recall ever since I found it.*

**09/09/24**  
There was nothing that stood out this morning; it fell into the backdrop of every other morning of the working week. It was raining. I don’t think it’s stopped raining for a while now. You could probably guess I live in the north, just from the description of the weather. I woke up early, before 7. Like always, I saw my wife, Alice, also stirring awake. Before I was ready to leave the comfort of my bed, I felt the unmistakable weight of my cat, Porridge, sat on my chest, slowly caving it in. He made sure that the momentary peace I may have been able to cling to was aptly thrown out. We live on the top floor of an apartment complex that is neither large nor glamorous. The walls and floors are thin, we’ve had enough awkward encounters with our downstairs neighbour, Michael, enough times to know *just* how thin they are. I’ve always had trouble getting to sleep. I’ve never known exactly why, but in the night I fixate on any sound or sensation. If it’s too hot, too cold, if I have any plans in the next few days. But the sound of the footsteps of any neighbour going up the stairs would consistently break my train of thought. I got pretty good at guessing who it was, I could usually tell from the sound of the door opening, or the weight of the footsteps. On that morning, I followed my ritual of stretching and cracking every joint in my body, giving my wife the morning sound of a glow stick rolling out of bed. We’re a young couple, myself 25, Alice 24, but a couple of years working in a warehouse feels like it’s aged me by a few centuries.

I got the job when I was a student, and only a few years ago went full-time. The pay was good, but the stability was better. We're saving up for a mortgage, and while our apartment wasn’t great, it was cheap- that was all we needed. Living on the top floor and having some hard years as students, my wife and I are no stranger to mould. It was probably listed on the property description with the amount that was there when we first moved in. It covered the roof of both the bathrooms with each colony of mould seemingly fighting over the damp territory. The bedroom was the worst though, it looked like a pot of ink had been knocked over the milk-white ceiling. The corners had mould crawling down to the skirting board, and several labour intensive days later we had finally made the house breathable. Liveable. That morning though, I thought our old friend had made a reappearance on the skirting board adjacent to my bedside.

Porridge had leapt off my chest, and began to head towards this familiar sight. I quickly left the warmth from the bed, grabbing his sagging stomach and hoisting him away. He doesn’t like to be held, but the fleeting warmth from the bedsheets eased this torturous event for him. I took the cat outside of the bedroom and fed him his breakfast. If I was ever curious what Porridge’s look of love would be, I know that if I just keep an eye on him as I squeeze out his packet of food, I can see a brief moment where he shows something akin to affection. I remember how cold it got, I was only in my boxers when I took Porridge out of the bedroom and fed him, and I needed to get changed. Every step of the carpet felt like treading on shavings of ice. After the issue with the mould, Alice and I made a habit of keeping the windows open at all times. I remember my pace quickening, I ran on my toes and practically sprinted back to the bedroom. I had to get dressed and I had to clean the mould off before Porridge develops a taste for it.

Our deal has always worked: Alice would make us breakfast, as she started later than me, and I would feed Porridge as I was always able to get out of bed quicker than her. As I walked into the bedroom, she walked past me towards the kitchen. I sat on the edge of the bed and began to get dressed. It was while I was putting on my socks that I saw that the mould on the skirting board was perfectly circular. I didn’t measure it, but it was roughly the size of a 5p coin. After getting dressed I took a Dettol wipe and bent slightly to reach and began to wipe over and over again the spot on the skirting board. Every time I felt my finger press against the spot of mould, it felt like it was indenting into the wall. I wrapped another wipe around my hand after seeing it was still there after a couple seconds of wiping. I pressed my index finger along the skirting board and pressed firmly. My nail dipped into a sort of divot, slightly bending it. My first thought was that the mould had somehow eaten through a partial bit of the wooden skirting board. I left the bedroom leaving the Dettol wipes on the floor and found Alice in the kitchen.

I remember I was angry, we have had countless hours of wiping, bleaching, and re-painting walls ever since we moved in as young students. I didn't need to be cleaning first thing in the morning. I was a dick about it. I've since apologised to my wife. I think I said something about the dangers of us having a cat if he was going to be able to eat mould if it grew. I knew that as much as Alice loved me, she doted on him. I didn't know why I was so angry, I could have been hungry, or cold or still tired, but I was a dick. She asked what crawled up my arse, and if I didn’t want to go into work that day, not to take it out on her. I noticed that Porridge hadn’t touched any of his food. Instead, he was just lounging on the sofa, as though he hadn’t just had a full night of rest. I think this was one of a handful of times Porridge didn't devour his food without a second thought.  We went back into the bedroom and I showed her the spot. She picked up the previously discarded Dettol wipe and began to wipe it away. She mockingly did some sort of ‘ta-da’ motion as she took the wipe away - it was still there.

We spoke about the divot in the wall and she asked for another wipe. I watched her as she wrapped the wipe around her pointed nail, as the first few millimetres slid in. She turned around and asked why I had drilled into the skirting board. I asked her to move out of the way, and I laid down as flat as I could and angled my head towards the spot, and she was right. It was a perfectly circular hole that had been drilled into the wall. I asked her why would I ever drill into our skirting board and she assured me she knows it wasn't her, and she can hazard a pretty good guess if porridge had learnt to use machinery. There was a few moments where we both realised that whatever this was, wasn't caused by either of us. I don't really know when the feeling dawned on us, but it hasn't left since. The silence in the room gave it ample room to grow. It pulsated in-between quick glances at each other. After many shared looks, Alice asked me

"So, who drilled it then?".

It felt like she had actualised my anxieties, spoken to them into existence, and left me there to answer them. I don’t know. I still don’t. I looked into the hole but I could only see absolute darkness. It was as though a couple inches had been drilled into the brick wall, and that there was nothing in front or on either side. It was just pure black. Even with the light on and the natural light bleeding in from the window, I couldn’t see a shred of anything inside it. I pointed out to Alice that there were no wood shavings, bits of brick, flakes of plaster or anything surrounding the hole. I looked in between the strands of carpet for minutes, desperately trying to see something. I don’t know what I wanted to see, I don't know if I would have even wanted to find anything. But there was nothing. It was the same garish carpet that paves the communal areas of the apartment. When I had realised just how long we had been searching in-between the strands of carpet, I realised that I had to get to work and had to make my train.

The hunger and the anxiety didn’t make for a good day in the office. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety for a few years now. I worry about many things. I can’t drive for fear of the test, I struggle to calm my nerves and find myself awake almost every night for far too long recycling memories that I need to try and move past. I’ve been medicated for only a few month’s and apart from the mood swings, the freight train of anxiety has subsided. This was the first time since the medication set in that I felt such a wave of dread resurface. I remember on my way out of the apartment, I looked at the skirting board in the communal area outside our door, floor number 3, 2 and 1. There was nothing on any of them. No holes, no mould. Whilst at work, I must have gone through about a hundred different theories about the hole. Did someone drill it whilst Alice and I were asleep? Did our landlord install a spy camera in our bedroom? Was the hole always there and we only just now have noticed. Every thought made the situation worse. I couldn’t stop myself from overthinking. The freight train was back. I watched every second on my monitor tick down until 5pm and I was the first out of the office. It made no difference as I still had to wait for my train, but I knew that my feet were moving faster than my brain. I paced in the station thinking about it. I was overreacting. I was being stupid. I needed to think of something else. I needed to check the train times. I needed to do a million and one different things to distract myself. I thought about it every second of the journey home. 

It was dark when I got home. The apartment had motion-sensor lights in the communal area, every time I’d get close to the door, I’d see through the obscured glass a bright flickering and then a constant stream of fluorescent light. Every floor had the same system. I'm sure the walls of the lower floors were thin enough that you could see the light through them. I never asked though. I walked up to the first floor, letting the light welcome me with open arms and then I searched every step, every corner and every crevice for anything. I was looking for mould, insects, markings, cracks, anything that would potentially calm my nerves. But there was nothing. It was the same usual signs of life that we've become accustomed to on our daily commune to work. I had left my satchel outside my front door and walked back down the staircase, walking towards Michael's door.

After a few knocks he meandered through, he was old, frail and had an air of loneliness about him. He always gave Alice the creeps, but I sympathise with him. He’s a kind soul. I asked him about any signs of drilling, and after telling him about the situation, he invited me in to have a look about. I think he was hoping for better company, but instead I simply checked alongside any skirting board, wall, or roof. There was no sign of anything. Feeling guilty about barging in and looking around his house, I stayed for a cup of tea. We spoke about how cold it was or something mundane. He asked about my work, and I about his, and as soon as it started, we had run out of things to talk about. I had to get back in, I knew that I was putting it off now. I couldn’t wait to get back and now that I was faced with my apartment, I didn’t want to go back in.

Alice would always arrive last, and it’s usually the deal that I’ll try and make a meal out of what we have left in the fridge. I said hello to Porridge and quickly began to make something for dinner. I remember it being terribly made, and Alice pretended to like it.  Porridge is usually the most affectionate when I come in, after a good few hours alone, he’ll take what company he can get. Within seconds of greeting me, he was back on his heated mat. He didn’t seem to crave company, rather than to just check out who walked through the door. A few minutes before my disaster of a meal was ready, Alice had arrived. We spoke about our days, about our co-workers and I was the first to bring it up. I asked if she had thought about the drilled hole at all, to which she haphazardly responded ‘no’. I confessed it had plagued my head all day, and I told her all my conspiracies, she sighed and asked me how anxious I was feeling. I realised how I sounded. She told me that I needed to make sure that I was taking my medication and if I felt it wasn’t working anymore, I needed to speak with my GP to arrange either a higher dose or a different brand of medication.

I wasn’t upset with her, she put up with my anxious nature for years, and was the one to encourage me to get help for it. It was only natural for her at this point to think it had gotten bad again. We ate a surprisingly not awful dinner, and watched something on the television until I noticed Alice beginning to lengthen her blinks by the minute. We had both got into pyjamas that were two sizes too big for the pair of us and embraced the company against the cold night air. I could see Alice shutting her eyes and pretending to me that she was still fully awake. I asked her if was going to sleep, to which she said she was ‘relaxing her eyes’. She always says it when she wants to go to bed. I gently guided my half-asleep wife to the bedroom and I laid there with her.

I was still wired awake, but I made it a habit to lay with her until she went to sleep first. I used to get back out of bed and either pace about or play my games or something unproductive. Sometimes I’ll lay there for hours, thinking about thoughts that refuse to be satisfied. I’ve told her it’s like a slideshow that doesn’t stop and cannot be ignored. Despite being encouraged to take sleeping tablets, I’ve always hesitated. I think it’s an aversion to medication, clinical or over-the-counter. While Porridge rolled around on the floor, flicking toy carrots, and chewing old books I had started but never finished, I laid with her head on my chest for hours. I laid there for hours listening to her breathe. I thought about about all the sockets that need to be turned off, the silence of the stairwell underneath us,  what my co-workers had mentioned to me at work, but most importantly, the hole in the wall. I checked the time, and it was sometime around late 9pm, or maybe the early minutes of 10. I got out of bed after manoeuvring her head off of me, her black hair lay out across the white bedsheets, like a charcoal crime scene. I laid on the floor of the bedroom, and began to look at the hole. I placed my head adjacent to it, I was close but not so close that I placed my eye over the hole. It was a few inches from my face. It was impossibly dark, it seemed as though the fluorescent light was just avoiding the hole completely.

I knew quickly that I wouldn't be able to sleep until I could answer all my questions. I grabbed my phone, turned on the torch, and continuously attempted to get several different angles that would allow me to see past the phone, while ensuring that the hole was entirely lit. It couldn’t be done. Finally, I started recording with the flashlight on. I pressed my phone against the penny-like divot to see if I could see anything. I stared at the camera screen with intensity as I moved the torch from left to right over the hole. The white wall became luminescent but the hole in the wall consumed the light. It was late but I knew that Alice would understand. I needed her there. I gently awoke her and showed her the recording. After a couple minutes of watching the video on replay and gradually coming to reality, she sat upright and watched closely. I could see her brain working as she watched the video. She didn't understand it. I remember thinking 'Thank god, it's not just me'. It was rapidly approaching 11pm and she furrowed her brow as she played the video for the last time. I explained everything that happened to her, the both of us drowning in our lack of answers. There was something lodged in my throat somewhere between anxiety and dread.

She asked if she could try herself, we reasoned that maybe because my phone is a few generations behind hers, it might have glitched, or bugged, or something vague that could briefly fill in our gap of logic. She assumed the same position I had taken moments ago, and followed my exact motions that I had just shown her. It was the same. The hole in the wall was eating any light that came in and revealed nothing. Alice pressed her nail into the hole, and asked me to do the same. Neither of us could feel an end to the hole, it was just too narrow to get further. That anxiety began to fester once more, and after we’d established that the hole was deeper, we then had to address the question that filled me with a bubbling horror: 'How deep was it?'

We sat there with both our flashlights on breathing in the silence. After a few moments, Alice asked me to get a thin metal straw from the kitchen. She placed the tip of the metal straw at the entrance of the hole and continued to record while the flashlight was on. She told me that the metal might reflect the light, and that we could also get a sense of how deep this hole actually was from the straw. The light illuminated the silver metal, but still revealed nothing about the hole. We both sat there while she slowly pushed the straw further and further. There was no resistance, she couldn't feel any grooves in the side of the wall. I watched as the hole continued to devour the straw. The atmosphere was still, neither of us said a word, neither of us blinked. It wasn’t possible.

Alice had the straw about 7 or so inches into the wall, there was little room for her to hold it, but she pinched it between her fingers and rested it between her fingers and the drill-hole. I told her to stay there and not to push it any further. She asked why, and I just begged her to not push it any further. I hurriedly grabbed a pair of shoes, kept my flashlight on and grabbed my keys. I left the apartment with the light outside the front door turning on as I swung the door open. I stood at the top of the stairs paralysed. It was late, and I know that I didn't hear anyone from the moment Alice and I went to bed. There was no gentle hum of electricity, no footsteps ascending or descending the stairs. I swallowed hard. I don’t know how long I stood outside our door, staring down the staircase at the lights for the floor below. Steady. Constant. Flooding the floor with bright light. I strained to keep my eyes open underneath the flickering fluorescent as all lights did when they were alerted to someone's presence.

I don't even remember how long I held my breath for. It was only after a few beats that I realised that I was even holding my breath. I stared at the dirty carpet connecting the floor together, almost scared to look at the light. I remember holding the hand rail so tight I saw the white in my knuckles. I walked down slowly, I'd like to pretend it was out of courtesy for my neighbours, but it was out of pure fear. I felt as though the cramped landing connecting the entire floor together would somehow harbour something that wasn't aware of my presence as long as I didn't breathe or make any noise. I felt like a deer braving a busy motorway, trying to avoid making eye contact with the rushing headlights. I checked every corner; I checked the stairs and I checked the roof. I couldn’t see it. The metal straw was nowhere to be seen. There would be at least 5 inches of metal sticking out of the thin walls of our apartment or, as I had thought, through the floor. I stared at the dirty white roof for so long.

I knew I wouldn’t find anything. I couldn’t stop looking. I continuously looked over the banister then rapidly back behind me, checking if anyone was coming, or if anyone was behind me. I couldn’t believe how much I was sweating. I could feel my pyjamas cling to my body as I swung myself around multiple times. I walked backwards up the stairs, keeping an eye on the floor. I stood outside our door for a few moments. It couldn’t have been more than 10 seconds, as I watched the motion-activated lights switch off. I couldn’t believe how quiet it felt at that moment. I threw my keys in the key-bowl and ran back into the bedroom and told Alice everything. She said nothing. We looked at each other, sharing a feeling that couldn’t be verbalised. After several seconds of eye contact, without either of us saying a word, she had let go of the last inch of straw. After a second or two, you could hear it. The metal straw struck something hard. It ricocheted off of a hard surface. Something wooden or something concrete. You could recognise the sound of the straw striking the ground, and rapidly tapping the surface as it began to find its balance and stop rolling. After a few seconds, the noise had stopped altogether. Alice grabbed my hand, cold with sweat and hot with fear. She steadied just how much I was shaking.

All I could hear was my heart pounding, I felt it in my teeth.

I felt Alice grab my hand. She looked at me with an expression I'd never seen before.

We heard footsteps.
