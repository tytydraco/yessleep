I'm an academic by the name of Ackley, living in North Dakota. Though very intelligent and highly qualified, some might call me a womanizer. Albeit, not a very successful one. Maybe they'd call me a creep instead. I don't know why, but I have a penchant for pursuing nearly any woman who passes me by. I've been told a sense of desperation reeks from me at all times.

The day before Memorial day, I meandered along the sidewalk outside of the city as I usually do. Suddenly, a red Mercedes appeared to my side, crawling through the rush hour traffic. Glancing inside, I noticed the woman in the back seat was extremely beautiful. So, I creeped closer to get a better view of her, when I discovered the passenger seat window was cracked open.

The passenger was even more beautiful, more-so than any woman I had ever laid eyes upon. It was clear that she commanded some authority over the other women in the car. Captivated and starstruck by her beauty and prowess, I could not stop staring at her. The luxurious woman dazzled my eyes. I continued to stare, prowling far too close to the vehicle.

The woman whose looks captured my gaze called out to one of her servants. 

"Roll down the window. Who is this rude ass dude staring at me?"

The woman driving shot daggers at me.

"Her father is the most important banker in this city. She's not some penniless fool you can stare at as you please." The older woman said in a posh british accent. She then grabbed a golden perfume bottle and sprayed it in my face. I rubbed my eyes and when I opened them, the car was gone. How was this possible? In this traffic, there's no way that car could have gone very far in that short amount of time. I ran along the sidewalk, but to no avail. The car really had disappeared. Frightened, I returned to my home. My eyes grew more and more uncomfortable.

Upon returning, I sought a doctor for an eye examination. On each of my pupils a small spiral resided, but the doctor was unable to remove it. My eyes drenched with tears. As the days dragged along, the spiral grew larger. My vision now completely lost.

No doctor could make heads or tails of it and any medicine I tried failed. The spiral grew and grew in my eyes, appearing as if it would burst at a moments notice. My condition worsened and medicine failed me. I abandoned all hope and longed for the gratifying release of death. I could not live without sight.

I began to experience self-hatred and longed for repentance. As the situation grew dire, I heard whispers of more alternative forms of healing. These inklings of strange ideas, I didn't know from whence they came. Faint voices in passing, were they strangers passing by or something more sinister? I knew not, due to my lack of sight. All I knew, was the promise of my suffering coming to a halt.

I studied hard, hiring someone to read from an old book the voices told me about. It was tiring at first, but after a while, the results were in. My mind was in a state of calm I had not thought possible. I spent every night in devotion to this book. After a year passed I achieved tranquility. I was content with my blindness.

One night as I lay in bed drifting to sleep, a small noise awoke me. As faint as the wings of an insect. It was a voice and it came from my eyes. I don't know how, but it did.

"It's so dark." It said. I lay awake for hours petrified in fear. At around 7 am I finally fell asleep. When I awoke much later in the evening, something was different. I could see again! I quickly ran to the bathroom mirror. A faint spiral in my eyes remained as a subtle sign of my past mistakes.
