It has been 10 years since I have talked to or seen my grandmother.

 When I was 12 I was sent out of state to visit my grandmother for about a week. At the time I have not seen her since I was 8, when my mother died (her daughter), but I would talk to her on the phone and write time to time. She lives far enough where I have to get on a plane to see her. 
This was my first time flying alone without a guardian, but I managed just fine, with some help of some  airport workers. My grandmother picks me up from the airport and as I get into the car there seems to be something really off. 
She is talking to me weird, almost like I was an object instead of like her granddaughter. She was using phrases like "you're a pretty little thing", things like that. After that it really went all down hill. 
We arrived at her home and the house is completely changed. The living room is a shrine to my mother (giant pictures, crosses, ashes, my mothers objects, the whole 9), and everything else looks like her house decades ago.

 I don't know what to say or do so I go upstairs to what I thought would've been a guest bedroom only to find that my grandmother has made it into a perfect recreation of my mother's old bedroom. I don't know what to do and honestly it's a lot for me to digest. I am lucky that it was getting late so I just told my grandmother that I needed to take a shower and go to bed. 
I get into the shower and get ready for bed into the bathroom. When I finished I got my pjs on and walk back into the bedroom. My luggage is gone. 
I am absolutely terrified. I ask my grandmother if she has seen my suitcase and she told me she had no idea what I was talking about, and that she never saw me with any luggage (obvious delusion). I don't press it any more and I go to bed. I obviously can't sleep because I am scared of my grandmother, so I am just laying in bed in the dark trying to think of something else to help with the terror. I hear the door slowly opening and I can hear my grandmother walk near the bed, she is humming to herself. I stay perfectly still in the bed absolutely petrified. For about 20 minutes and just watches me and hums to herself and then leaves.

 I get up when I can to close the door and basically slept right in front of the door to block it. The rest of the nights I lock my door when I go to bed.

The next morning my grandmother is in the kitchen acting "normal", cooking breakfast. I ask her again if she had seen my clothes, and she again says no, but I should wear the clothes up in that room (my moms old clothes). I go up, and find the most normal looking combo to me, a pair of jeans and a t shirt. I go down and my grandmother gets all bright and says "oh there's my sweet Selena!!", I feel sick. 

That is my mother’s name. 

I am absolutely petrified, I've never dealt with before. I just sit down and eat breakfast. I act like everything is normal until my grandmother gave me time to do something. She went outside to work on her garden, and I call my parents. I try to explain them what's happening as best as I could and how uncomfortable I was and how I really wanted to go home. They thought I was exaggerating or not telling the truth, and said I need to just deal with it, and it was only a week.

 I feel absolutely helpless. 
Basically at that point I was just on survivor mode, I was just trying to make it through the week and get home. I tried to spend as much time alone. I read books in my room, I go on runs around the neighborhood, I tell my grandmother I need to work on schoolwork I brought with me, basically anything so I am by myself. This worked well for basically 3 days. I am able to make time go by as fast as I can by myself. 

By the third day she snapped. While we were driving she started hysterically crying, and asks me why I'm abandoning her, and that she is going to get custody of me. She tells me that she is going to tell CPS that my father is a danger (he is not) and because my stepmom didn't adopt me that I would be living with her now. I'm so scared, I am shaking. She is driving recklessly, I tell her to drive us back home. She drove in circles, until I threatened to jump out the car unless we went home. 

We get home and I go straight up to the room I'm staying in, lock the door, and sit down in front of it so I can hear where she is. I hear her walking up the stairs. She is singing to herself, and starts calling for me by my moms name. I don't answer. 
I can hear her in front of the door but she is not doing anything I could hear. I am scared shitless. She stayed like that for an hour. She finally goes to her room. I waited until after midnight to get out of my room, because I knew my grandmother would be asleep. 

I called my parents again using the landline in the kitchen. My stepmom answered, and I told her that my grandmother is absolutely insane and that I needed to come home. She told me that I was only there for another day and a half, and that she wasn't going to get me an earlier flight. I feel so mad and frustrated with my stepmom. I felt like I couldn't last another second in that home. 

My grandmother is upstairs and I don't want any confrontation so I go down in the basement to be alone, while digging, I see a lot of the stuff my family and I couldn't find in the estate after my mom passed, and not only that but I found my suitcase. I grab it and I go up stairs. I run up the stairs and I lock the door to my room. I hear my grandmother get out of her room, and walk to mine. She just stood there for a couple hours, humming. 

I get into my real clothes and I stay in that room the entire day. I didn't eat anything, I didn’t drink anything, I didn't feel safe. 

Periodically I could hear my grandmother move around in her home, humming, and then coming back to my door, just waiting. I stayed in the room the entire night, sitting in front of the door. I fall asleep there. 

Finally it was the morning that I was able to go home. I was anxious, I had hours before my flight. But I just wanted to go to the airport now. I get my little things ready (almost everything I had was already packed). I hear my grandmother downstairs, making breakfast. I am really hungry at this point. I feel like I am being tortured, the time is going so slow, food is right there, but I feel like it's unreachable. I stay put. I count the fibers of the carpet. 

Finally it's time to go, and I feel an electric current jump out of my body to open my bedroom door. I open it. I walk downstairs with my luggage I found in the basement and I see my grandmother. She's in her living room, which again is just a shrine to my mom. She looks at me and tells me “good morning Selena.” I just tell her it's time to take me to the airport. She then takes 45 minutes to “get ready”, while I wait at the door. She is stalling. I tell her again it's time to go.

 She comes downstairs, we get in the car, and she starts going the wrong direction. I tell her and she turns around, she then misses a turn. She does this for about 20 minutes, until I crack, and start screaming. I open my car door and threatened to jump if she doesn't just drive me to the airport. She starts crying, but starts driving, very recklessly.

 I get to the airport an hour later than we planned, and 30 minutes before boarding. I was lucky as a minor because some airport workers saw I've been crying and helped me through security and to my gate. I have everything to thank to those people. I was the last person to board my plane, but I made it. This was the first time in a week I felt safe. I started crying. 

Ever since I have not had any contact with my grandmother. Other family members are in her life. It took years to forgive my parents for not getting me out of that situation. They now feel bad that they left me there.
