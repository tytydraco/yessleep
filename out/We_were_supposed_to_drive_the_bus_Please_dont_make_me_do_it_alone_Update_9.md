I’ve got a new heart. But I don’t feel young again. I just feel sick.

So after the motel thing, I’m left with about two dozen passengers. I notice that the ones left are mostly the ones who’d seemed. More content, during the initial drivin’. Not quite as jumpy. Not quite as glassy eyed. Nobody puts nothin’ else extra in the boxes cept’ Lume. I don’t even look at what it was, since I heard the same thunk the flashlight’d made when it’d been dropped last night.

I hope you don’t mind. But I’m not feeling so great. I just want to. Get this out.

Lume has already decided, not even half an hour after their friend died, that they can be fixed. They tell me they still want to go to Angelvale. That they’d heard they’ve fixed all sorts of broken people, that they work genuine miracles. I think they’re desperate. But I think that, even so, it’s worth a try. I think, no matter what happens, if you think there’s a chance. If there’s someone who’s worth it to you, or if you even just wanna be kind, it’s worth a try.

I don’t ask my Trainee to drive the bus the next morning. She doesn’t seem like she’d be eager. We put the body of the cat-thing in the hatch space. Lume just called it Spotter, and I’m not sure if that was a nickname they’d given or not. If you don’t say their name, the one that actually means *them*, then they can’t be dead. I guess that’s what they must’ve been thinkin’. Only the dead don’t have to follow the rules.

It’s quiet. The drive to the hospital. Some of the folk, I think I’ve mentioned before, they can feel when you’re prying into their business. Like when we feel eyes on the back of our head and get goosebumps. Some folk also have it the other way around, they just know when something private is happening. I get barely any souls on my bus that morning, and I think it’s because everyone sensed that mourning dread coming off my vehicle. I’ll be honest. It’s not the first time I’ve felt like I wasn’t driving a bus, just a glorified hearse.

A part of me still thinks that sounds about right.

My Trainee didn’t drive, but she did sit up top this time. I saw guilt in her every feature. Posture, the twitch of her nose, the way she just leaned and looked out the window. She only looked right. I saw one of the rabbit folk, one of the ones that were left, go over to her. They sat in her seat with her, and they hesitated a moment. They reached out their hand and put it on her shoulder. I watched in the rear view. Saw my Trainee kind of frown at em’, then they pulled each other into an embrace.

I felt like I was looking at myself, then. I’ve looked into the mirror plenty of times, saw a sad husk of an old fool looking back. And I never really liked him. And few folk ever came to my side to hold me like that. But I told myself. I told myself, see, I said ‘Driver, you daft knucklehead, if you keep thinking like that nobody ever will’. And I told myself, too, ‘and what about the folk out there, looking at themselves just like you are, who just need to get somewhere thinking like that won’t make sense anymore?’.

So I kept driving. Like I did then. I thought of the walls. Lume had called them boring, but nice. To me, that smelled of safety, and that was something I wanted so badly. But you retire when you can’t do your job anymore, or when the job is done. And neither applied yet.

Eventually, the landscape went through enough colors and faces that it pulled up Angelvale’s. The road there felt familiar, in more ways than one. It sat in the middle of a suburban area, probably the leftovers of some city or other. Tall, white, boxy, with glass windows that ran across most of its length. It had two taller sections that stood all prideful above the rest, which reminded me a bit of castle towers. I think they were called drums or some such. Maybe rounds. All of the windows had curtains or blankets over them, or were boarded shut.

The sign outside the hospital has a name that ain’t scratched over. *Welcome to Angelvale*. They didn’t bother scratching out the other parts, except the arrows pointing to places that no longer existed. It had some kind of street address that was all garbled nonsense. I suppose so you could find it, even though it was probably not where it was supposed to be anymore. The thing that I cared about was the rules.

*Formality in partial effect. Hospital rules as follows: please do not bring hazardous food, drink, or materials inside. Please do not bring weapons inside. Please do not take up the Doctor’s time unless you feel ill, or suspect yourself to be, or are in denial of being so. The only thing that will be punished is fully cognizant theft and harm. Please consider that we cannot operate on those who did not give consent first. Advance pre-authorization is recommended.*

I think this might’ve been where I’d spent that sick time at. Was that after the Lodge showed up? The tunnels? I’ve got my recorder back, I listened to every one on a loop. But I think. I think maybe some part of me is wanting to forget now. To freeze up and stop making decisions. It wants to let the roads fade away forever, and to let me start shutting my eyes and ears to everyone else. I think I really thought about it. But I remembered I can’t.

It’s not always the world that wants you to forget. Or the things in it. Sometimes, it’s just you.

I pull up. I see there’s a bus stop. Posts and all. I figure I must’ve driven a lot of people here, and from here. Easy to find, easy to forget if you don’t have to go inside. But today I had to. All the rabbits filed in with me, and so did my Trainee, and Lume. I asked some of the rabbity sorts to help me carry the Spotter, and to my surprise they did. I guess when you can hear everyone’s hearts, you can tell whose is in it when someone does something not quite proper.

The receptionist checked us in. I didn’t even flinch this time when they asked me if certain things had changed. When they told me I’d been checked in multiple times before. All the half-rabbits follow my lead, and Lume gets a guest pass. My Trainee checked herself in, around this point, kind of melted into her herd. My head was full of fuzz, and I think she’d noticed.

The halls were white and prim, little black and white tiles running under my feet. It felt odd, like I was leading a flock, as my Trainee and her folk trail after me, feet padding or squeaking or shuffling along the floor in echoes. A lot of people peeked out of rooms as we passed em’, made faces of all sorts at the noise. Some shook their heads as they ducked back in.

We passed hanging signs, telling us where we were going. The herd broke up and filtered itself into wherever they needed to go as we went. I saw things like *hidden injury*, *trade mishaps*, *varied therapy*, *operation*, *long term visit/stay*, and *legality navigation*. The last one had me raising my brows. I squinted, adjusted my glasses, and there was a little subtitle under it reading *check here first if the results of treatment in relation to Formality are unclear, Society Legality will advise*. There was a big cardboard cutout of an arrow pointing towards it right next to it, and if I traced my steps a bit I saw smaller arrows painted onto the walls guiding towards it.

“Well huh. I guess that must be important.” When I said that, one of the rabbit folk looked at me. Stared. Then they went that way. A lot of them had gone towards *hidden injury*, *varied therapy*, *operation*. All sorts of problems for all sorts of folks, and a lot of em’ end up bugging you right after you fix another. When I got antsy later, walked around a bit, I noticed a lot of this signage had *ECFK Approved* under it, followed by something sounding like *job title located here*. I think the ones that didn’t were for specialists, maybe, or just for folk that didn’t want to deal with whoever that was. Lot of the hospital wings - that the right word? - had dupes.

The rest around here is a tad boring, so I’ll spare you. We find a doctor who chats a bit with Lume. I step out, sit and alternate between roaming and antsy foot tapping in a waiting room. My Trainee sits with me, and it registers she was gone for a bit. I frown a little.

“There’s so much… Going on, lately. You doing okay?” I ask. I mean it, but I probably sounded a little out of it.

“I am.” She paused, shook her head. “No. Are you?”

“I try my best to be. I can’t tell most of the time, honest.” I smack my lips, rub my hands against my legs. I’d felt a little sore in my legs. I was having a hard time thinking what to say, too. “I… I’m sorry I didn’t help.”

“You couldn’t. You aren’t strong enough.”

I balk for a second, then sigh. “I guess. That’s what you’re for, though, ain’t it?” I tried to smile, but it was shaky, and I think I’d just sounded desperate. Maybe I’d been putting too much pressure on her.

She doesn’t say anything for a bit. Eventually, she tilts her head. “Have you ever felt strong?”

“Whatcha mean?”

“Like you could… Really do anything. Anything you wanted. Like you were… Doing your job right.” She thumps her foot, lightly, on a loop. “Like you… Belonged.”

I get some kinda half-flashback, suck my bottom lip. “Might’ve. I think… I think at the Office, maybe. I think I’ve been doing this job a fair bit of time.”

“What keeps you going?” She stops looking at me, puts her eyes towards the blanketed window instead. There’s only a handful of souls in the waiting room with us. It’s quiet. A little dark, but in a peaceful way.

“When I get those little letters. Before that, when I looked through the things I’d gotten. When I picked someone up and they said they were pleased as punch with how things were going.” I answered pretty quick. It’s easy to do when you’re sure of your words. “I think, maybe, though, it’s. When I feel lost, I’ve still got the bus. When I see someone else who’s lost, I can use it to make them not so lost. Things don’t… Always go well, but sometimes I can make them better.”

“But not always?”

“No, not always. But enough.” She looked at me funny. I don’t think she believed me. I don’t think I did, either. It’s hard, sometimes, to look at the positives when hell is just around the corner. Or something worse. And sometimes? Sometimes, I think, that it’s easier to go there yourself than watch someone you care about do the goin’.

We talked for a while. About little things. Stuff I’d gotten paid with. A few particularly notable drop offs and pickups. She told me about a few places she wanted to see. Some stuff she wanted to do. When I asked her if she still wanted to drive, she said yes. Then she asked me something again.

“Do you wish you still drove alone?”

I blinked at her. “Sorry?”

“Do you ever think… It’s better to be alone?” She watched one of her kin walk down this way. When I looked their way, they looked real deflated. They fussed with a stitch keeping a human hand on a not-so-human torso. I saw them pull one out of place and winced. Wondered if I should get up and check on them. I wish folk would just. Let us stick our nose in their business, sometimes. Strange thought to have, I know, but I can’t… Help if I don’t know what all’s wrong.

“Sometimes. When I need to think. But I don’t think I’d ever want to be alone forever.”

“I’m sorry.”

“For?”

“Not coming around sooner.” She smiled at me, a smile that trembled a little. I held her hand, returned the grin, but I’m not sure I should’ve smiled at that anymore. We sat there like that, not making another peep, for maybe half an hour or so more. Lume came out, sat down with us.

“They said they can’t do anything.” They announced. Their light was as dim as their voice. “That… They’d just get taken again after. I told them I did not want that. They apologized.” They looked up at me. “Can you take me somewhere they can do something? Please? You must know somewhere.”

But I didn’t. And I didn’t know how to say that. It broke my heart. They didn’t need me to utter a word, they watched me shake my head all slow like and knew my answer. They said they’d wait for someone who could. I saw them get up and move over to the *long term visit/stay* area. I watched them go with a big frown. I can drive the bus. But I can’t guarantee someone’ll be happy once they’re dropped off. Some people are just worse off when I do. I can’t control how things shake out, just how folk get places.

My Trainee got up, said she’d go check on em’. I don’t know for sure where they actually went, though. I fell asleep in the waiting area chair I’d hunkered down in. I was tired, in more ways than one.

I woke to the sound of rabbits squealing. When I opened my eyes, all startled, I saw the one that’d been picking at its stitches up at one of the windows. It was ripping down one of the curtains. Someone’d glued or otherwise stuck it to the frame somehow, but they fixed that with a scalpel I have a feeling they hadn’t asked to have. I saw a nurse - a lot of them looked the same, when I thought about it later - move over to em’.

“Please refrain from harming the decor.” He looked real concerned. Pulled gloves out of his pocket and slipped them on with a snap. They stood there for a second, paced instead of reaching out. I think they were trying to figure out what their wiggle room was in hospital rules. When they saw the scalpel, they went rigid for just a second before lunging. They tried to pull the rabbit folk down to the ground, probably thinking to pin them and call for someone else, but they got kicked in the abdomen. This one had rabbit feet, so it probably hurt. I saw em’ double over.

The rabbit broke through the window. That is, they backed up a bit, ran forward, and jumped. Glass shattered and went everywhere, glittering in the moonlight. The moon was full in the sky, and the stars shone so bright I swear if you pulled down the moon they’d fill in just fine.

It started to float. I didn’t hear the thud of a body hitting the ground. They just. Went up. Real slow and gentle like. I caught the reflection of an earring and a necklace coming off them - can’t remember if they’d come in with it - before they went high enough I couldn’t see them anymore.

I shot up to my feet. I called for my Trainee, started moving down the halls. Careful at first, wasn’t sure what was going on, but the moment I saw another flash of fur and stitching I went towards it. All the nurses started moving around. I heard a voice call over the intercom.

“Please stay in your rooms. If you’ve not been admitted or signed in, you are given free permission to enter areas present staff is willing to guide you to.” About the same time, someone grabbed at me, said something about shelter. I ignored them, elbowed them hard enough I sent em’ into a wall. I had a split second of panic, but rules be damned if I was going to wait and gawk while my apprentice was in danger.

I felt terror wash over me like it hadn’t in years. I think, end of day, my greatest fear isn’t going away. It’s being alone.

I follow the sounds of squeaking shoes, squealing, thumping and growling. All sorts of other noises filter around me, but I ignore them. Everything except that faint music. The staticy voice that came over the intercom that wasn’t owned by any doctor. And somehow, it managed to drown out the sound of shattering glass, tearing fabric, and nails being ripped out of boards.

“Go to the roof. I don’t want her back. I don’t know how to take them back yet. Not in a way they should be.”

I almost stop to help one of her folk that I pass. But I figure I can’t wrestle them down. And I get selfish. I think strangers aren’t as important, even though everyone I’ve ever known was a stranger first. One of the nurses comes by and nods at me. They’ve started going in groups. I see them pull someone away from a window. It looks awkward, they’re half-floating, half being dragged inside. They tie em’ to a bed with straps all while they’re screaming ‘let me go, let me go, I need to go home’ and trying to bite.

I pray I’m making the right decision. I find some stairs, thinking the elevator is too slow, pound up. My own feet sound screeching in my ears and I don’t bother counting how many flights I go up, I just go.

I stumble, hit a wall and get a purple bruise on my arm. I push myself back to my feet, whisper some encouragement to myself, and I burst through a metal door onto the top of the hospital.

My Trainee is standing on what looked like one of those emergency helicopter pads. Didn’t look like it’d been used in years. But I had a feeling I didn’t want anything taking off from there. Above me the night sky bled with twinkling dots and the cold chill sings with a song that feels deeply familiar. Overlaid on top of it is a voice. One that I stop listening to. There’s a more important one right in front of me.

She’s wearing that costume, with the dumb little tiara. I see the stitches on her neck are half-off. Her head hangs loosely. My throat catches. I almost freeze up, but I force myself to step towards her. She’s humming the song I’m hearing. Hands behind her back, fidgeting. She’s got the recorder she’d been using. She hits play. I think she wanted me to hear her, the real her, before she left.

I don’t want that to be all I’ve got left of her. So I try to drag her back. “Come on. Let’s go back to the bus. You…”

“I’m going somewhere better. Better than the mall. Better than the walls.”

“I can take you anywhere you want to go. Anywhere. Just-”

“I want to be where I need to be. Not where I want to be.” She turns around. She’s crying, little black-brown eyes all wet. “Do you think I’m human? Or an animal?”

“What? It don’t matter none. You’re-”

“It does, though.” She steps towards me. “I think I’m ugly. I think I don’t belong. I think the beautiful and wonderful things down here aren’t for me.” She cocks her head. “Doesn’t it hurt you, too? Trying to… Help people, know them. Then they go away. And sometimes it’s your fault.”

“It does. It hurts a hell of a lot. But if I’m not down here, I can’t do a lick of good.”

“Stop. Stop worrying about them. Let me take you somewhere for once. Let me take you somewhere… Quiet, and safe. Look!” She points up.

I see a little moon next to the big one, hiding in its shadow. It’s red instead of white. I see a building on the moon. But I don’t think that’s where it wants to take her. I have to stare for a while to make out the other thing in the sky. I see someone in a suit, all white with a round helmet with a black shining face. I know for fact I’m not supposed to be able to see it so clearly. But I can. And I can see the cord coming from its back. Like one of those tethers astronauts use to keep with their vessels.

It’s coming down. Not fast. But it’s coming down. I see them now. The other rabbits. There’s about a dozen, floating up towards it. I watch them. They seem dazed, out of it, like they’re overcome with some euphoria. Then they snap back, and they’re breathing hard, and the only reason they’re not screaming is because they’re scared it’ll make things worse somehow.

“That’s not a good place.” She’d told me her name. I just don’t… Use it. I didn’t want anything to hear, to find her. “You’re not ugly. You’ve got a good heart, and you’ve always kept me grounded.” I reach out to take her hand, and she lets me. I hold hers in mine, both, and my hands are shaking.

She frowns, shakes her head. “You’re getting too old for your job. Why don’t you just… No. You won’t listen, anyway.” She doesn’t let go. She holds my hand tighter. I see her start to change position, and I realize I’m the only thing holding her anchored to the earth.

Her folk come out. The ones that had looked not so displeased with what they looked like and where they were. They call her name in chorus, start grabbing at her. Try to pull down the others that weren’t so high. I see one has a ladder, but it can’t get them as far up as they need to be.

Something grabs at my Trainee. I see her smile, a real, wide one that looks like it hurts. But she’s crying. She mouths *don’t let me go. Please.*

But it’s got her. I see that suit wrap it’s arms around her, gentle as if she was a newborn. I see that it’s tether is wet and slick in a way it shouldn’t be. It smells all sorts of strange. Rancid, but sterile. I see it’s helmet open, and I see something that should be long dead that wasn’t. I hear the sounds of rabbits and something choking. I think it whispers something, but its not for me.

Its real voice calls to me. “I’m sorry.”

We can’t hold onto her. Not long enough. My arms give out. The rabbits around me keep grasping at the sky, calling, shouting names. Hospital staff comes up behind us, just watches in silence. I don’t fault them. I think they tried their best. At least, I choose to believe that.

I watch her go up for a bit. It feels like watching an angel pull someone away, but if you knew damn well it wasn’t one, and you had no idea what heaven actually looked like. I go down the stairs. I use the elevator this time, and I go out to the bus. I go right into the hatch. I root through all my things, and I can’t find any secret solutions. I feel guilt, wondering if she thought I was leaving her behind.

I come back up. I’ve not used one in a long time, if I ever have. I never gave back the rifle that witch had left on my bus. I didn’t think I’d ever have the guts to use it - it’s real hard to hurt someone, when you never know who’s confused and who’s really after blood - but I force my shaky fingers to make something resembling a proper aim. Lume comes up. They let me borrow their light.

I try to shoot that fake astronaut in the face. It’s peering right over her head, watching me like it’s taunting. I see a bullet go right through its helmet, but it doesn’t seem to care. I wonder if I can hit that cord. But it’s so far up.

One of the rabbits holds my arm. They look up at my Trainee. “Please, no.” I whisper. But I know what they’re thinking, and I picture all those people I’d seen over the years just. Disappear. That lady with the umbrella. Ori. I don’t know where they’re at now. I don’t know if they’re suffering.

I don’t want her to find out for me.

It takes me a few tries. But I get her in the center mass. I watch her choke on her own blood for a bit. I watch the light leave her eyes. But she smiles. I think she died afraid. But I think she’d rather die down here, than figure out what parts of her daydreaming were real and what were nightmares up there. I pass the rifle. I don’t got much ammo. I’d traded for some along the way, but not much.

I don’t stick around to see how many go back to earth. I just hear the shots. I think someone tries to catch me. I move towards the stairs. I think I was going off to find someone to help me move bodies. Or maybe I was just being a coward and didn’t want to look at hers.

I stumbled, and I hit my head on the way down the steps. I blacked out.

When I woke, it was in a hospital bed. I felt sprier than I should’ve. And when I asked why, I got an answer. I put two and two together.

When someone’s a friend, they can give gifts freely. That’s why you need to be careful with your words out here. They can come into your safe places, they can break little rules just for you. There’s some gray, but mostly it’s just. You trust them, and you find out whether or not you should’ve sooner or later.

I trusted her. But I don’t think she trusted me. I think she didn’t want to lose me, either. I freeze up in the lights when things get tough sometimes, or I’m hotheaded and pretending to be in my prime. I think I could run a marathon if I wanted now. But I just want to drive the bus.

I just don’t want to do it alone.

Were you silent because I haven’t spun my yarn well enough? Or was there just. Nothing that could’ve been done to help in the first place. Maybe it was always going to turn out like this. Maybe I should’ve kept a closer eye on things. On people, roads, things that were said and that I needed to remember. But I’m just human. I’m just human.

I wonder if the world could ever be as magical as she thought it was. I don’t know when you’ll hear from me next. I’ve got to… Sort some things out, I think. I can’t feel the roads so well anymore, so I might be driving for a while. But I’ll try to come back.

Someone has to drive the bus. For now, that’s me. It should've been [her](https://www.reddit.com/user/PattableGreeb/comments/1i9q80d/i_fell_from_the_moon_it_was_wonderful_down_there/), [too.](https://www.reddit.com/user/PattableGreeb/comments/1hspca3/outside_of_society_belong_or_be_forgotten_master/)
