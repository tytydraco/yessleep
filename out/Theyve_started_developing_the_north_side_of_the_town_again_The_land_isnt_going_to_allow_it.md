I've never been much of a writer, but after reading of and about all the good advice folks get online nowadays, figured maybe? Maybe asking for advice might help me too? Or if nothing else, it’ll help me sort out my own thoughts.


To make it simple - I’m pretty sure my town’s new activity center is eating people, and spitting out… I dunno. Not not-people, not changelings either. But some of the people who come back are - hollowed out, I guess would be a good term for it.


No, I should start with a bit more background information. 


Hi, my name’s Idris, I like D&D, hiking, horror movies, and being left the hell alone. I moved back to this gods forsaken black hole of a town a few months ago. I was born and raised here, and as soon as I could, I packed my stuff, and moved as far as I could until I hit an ocean. I swore that I’d never return here. Maybe I even believed that, when I was younger. Yet here we are again, and even though we now got wifi, fast food joints, and more than one bar… On anything that matters, this place is just as I left it 20 years ago. That means, this place gets *strange*. 


On the surface, it’s fine. Yet another small town that you can drive through in ten minutes. But there’s a reason why almost no new folks ever move here, or those who do, leave soon after. Why the town has got forested sections between suburbs, right next to town center. Why some older buildings have steel grates to close off the doors for the night, though an actual breaking and entering is so rare that it's front page news when it happens. Why the local forest/park/golf course has a freaking wizard tower, and the pond at the center of it has black swans only (they import new ones, whenever one of them dies).


You get the gist. There’s a weird undercurrent to this place, and if you live here, you either get used to it and follow its rules, or you get the hell out of Dodge. 


Me, I’m not fazed by a bit of weird or spooky. You leave it alone, it mostly leaves you alone. Or it used to. I’m not sure anymore.


A couple of weeks back, I got a call from Lyssa - my cousin Marten’s wife. She wanted to know if I’d talked to him of late. I hadn’t, not really, other than him liking some of my comments in the family group chat. I’d been still busy with the move, getting the farm fixed up, sorting out things for my new job. Life had been hectic.


“I’m asking, because you and Marten were close as kids. I know you even kept contact after you left. So I thought, maybe he’d talked to you about what’s wrong,” Lyssa said.


“No? What? What’s wrong?” 


“I don’t know! He’s just… down, all the time. Doesn’t want to talk about anything, doesn’t want to do anything. He won’t even go rock climbing anymore,” I could hear the worry in her voice.


Thing is, Marten is the one freak in the family, who *likes* exercise, especially combined with danger. And he’s the chatty social type. What a weirdo, right? So what Lyssa described, definitely wasn’t like him.

I apologized to Lyssa that I didn’t know what could be up with Marten. We organized a lunch, so I’d have an excuse to go see him in person. It’d be less weird than me just calling him, “Yo, why you being depressed?”


That lunch was a week and a half ago. It went… fine. Lyssa was keeping the conversation going, Marten mostly just nodded and stared in the distance, unless one of us asked him a direct question. I tried being circumspect, asking general news of what had been happening with everyone, since I’d been away for so long. I did learn that a lot more of my cousins had moved, or were moving back here than I had heard of before. That work was fine, despite the slowdown because of the world having gone tits up of late. That Marten had quit coaching the wall climbing club for kids. “Too busy to give it the time it deserves,” he said. 


After lunch, I meant to ask if Marten wanted to crack out the old PS4. I was willing to suffer an hour or two of mindless “go put ball in opposite team side”, to be able to talk to him alone. That didn’t pan out - he helped to clear the dishes, and the second me and Lyssa were distracted, he dipped out. I heard the bedroom door close upstairs.


I looked at Lyssa, she nodded.
“He does that,” she said, “Lies on the bed with his phone. But if you glance at it, he’s not even browsing. Just staring at whatever page opened first.”


“How long has this been going on?”


“Maybe a month? A bit less? One day, he came back from the climbing club meeting like usual, went straight to bed, then next morning, it was like this. I thought maybe it was a summer flu at first. I did get him to visit a doctor - all clear. But…” she trailed off.


“Has he said anything weird or concerning, anything at all?


“Nothing, or ‘It’s fine’. When you know it’s not even remotely fine.”


I went upstairs and knocked on the bedroom door. No answer. I knocked again, “Marty, you awake? Can I come in?”
I heard a muffled “sure” from the other side and opened the door. 


Marten was half slouched on the bed, looking at his phone like Lyssa had predicted. He looked alright, just completely disengaged. 


“Want to come play FIFA with me?”


“Nah,” he said without even looking at me.


“Oh c’mon, you know you want to. Ain’t like anyone else is willing to play those with you.”


“I’m good.”


Clearly, being circumspect wasn’t going to cut it. I sat on the corner of the bed.
“Dude. What’s going on with you?”


“Nothing. Everything is normal,” he replied.


“Ok, for one, obviously that’s not true. Second, who describes their life as ‘everything is normal’? That’s some ‘hello fellow humans’ shit.”


Marten finally looked away from his phone, and tried for a small smile, “Sorry. Everything is fine. Been tired of late, that’s all. Raincheck on FIFA?” He went back to staring at the screen, without waiting for an answer.


“...yeah. Alright. Talk to you later.”


I got up, and walked out, but I didn’t close the door the whole way. I stood outside, looking at him from the crack of the door. Marten lied on the bed, holding his phone, eerily still. His eyes looked at the screen, unmoving. If his chest hadn’t been moving, I’d have thought him a wax statue.


That’s when I really began to worry about him. It had been on the back of my mind, this town being what it is. But I hadn’t really believed that it could be anything… Abnormal. Marten was raised here, same as me. He knew how to take care of himself. Or he should have known.


I went back down and sat opposite of Lyssa on the kitchen table. She looked at me, expectantly.


“Yeah, no. Something’s wrong,” I agreed. 


She nodded. We sat in silence for a while, then she said, “Do you think it’s depression? Or a mental break, or…” she paused, and blushed, “I feel stupid of saying this, but - When I moved here, Marten told me about… And I’m a skeptic, right? There’s no such thing as supernatural. But Marten would insist on how this town is… Like there’s some things that aren’t…”


“The town is haunted six ways to Sunday. You can say it,” I said. 


She stared at me, raising her eyebrows.


“It’s not really a secret, if you talk to folks from around here,” I added.


Lyssa took a deep breath, clearly mentally scheduling a freakout, to be dealt with later, “Ok. So. You think it’s something like… that?”


“I don’t know. Perhaps. Or he fell and hit his head, and got the world's strangest concussion.”


I promised Lyssa that I’d try to think of something to help him. She gave me a couple of numbers to Marten’s friends, and for the other coach at the climbing club. She had already called them all, and none of them had been of any help. I gathered that I had been her last ditch effort.


I called through his friends - like Lyssa said, they didn’t know what was up with Marten. He’d been ghosting them, but no one could think of a reason why. The last call to the coach didn’t give any answers either, but it was curious. He didn't know that Marten had quit coaching, because the club hadn’t been open since the last time he was there.

“Some kind of summer bug went around, five kids from the club got sick. We cancelled last week's meets, so nobody else would catch whatever it was. And then the summer break started.”


Suspicious as all hell, right? I got more numbers from the coach, for the parents of the kids. He found it a bit strange that I wanted them, but accepted the explanation that Marten had been sick as well, and I was hoping someone else would have gotten a diagnosis on what was up.


Haven’t yet been able to get a hold of the parents, but like the coach said, it’s summer break time. Everyone’s visiting friends or holed up in their cabins. At least, I hope they are.


Because after that call, I went to visit the activity center where the club is. They’re still open, despite the official clubs and teams being on the break. And that is when I  *knew* Marten - and probably the kids too - were in a lot of trouble. 


I have to explain a bit of town history, for the rest of my story to make sense. Sorry if it gets boring for you guys. 


The oldest industrial zone in town is called Sunnyside - that’s not its real name, but what everyone colloquially calls it, because it’s between a rocky hill on the north, and the lakeside on the south. Thus, it was always in direct sunlight and safe from the northern winds. You’d think something that nice would be used for residential, right? Yeah, that’s been tried.


The area was first established in the mid 1800s, when the town began to grow to that side of the lake. An investor came from out of town, and built a lofty mansion on the hill and large summer estates by the lake. They planned to sell those as countryside retreats to rich folks. Can’t remember the family’s name off the top of my head, but they also bought and/or drove off farmers, to turn their land into modern style sugar beet fields. From the get go, they were not well liked by the locals.


Their mansion caught fire only a year after its construction finished. A year to the day, so the story goes. They rebuilt, they had the money. Two years to the day after the repairs were done, the household woke up to a horrid crash and screaming. Common house borers had veritably *infested* the roof beams. The roof gave way right on top of the children's room. Their oldest daughter survived, but none of her siblings did. 


The years had not been kind to the other families living in Sunnyside either - illness, injuries. One house had their stable sink into the ground after a spring flood. They were unable to get the horses out, the soil was so wet that it oozed right back down when they tried to dig. The braying of dying horses haunted them for days, until the last one - mercifully - drowned. 


It became harder and harder for the families to keep help, as word got around. When the lady of the mansion took their remaining child and left, most of the summer houses were already vacant. There were plans to turn the whole lakeside into more sugar beet fields, as the yield from the existing fields had been much poorer than expected.


The investor wasn’t ready to give up yet. He had sunk so much money into the endeavour, he wasn’t going to let some minor setbacks like sudden death, beet rot, or losing his family deter him. He doubled down, hired architects and builders all the way from Britain, and set them to design and build him a sugar refining factory on the - now mostly abandoned - Sunnyside.


It took them years to finish the build. It was hard to find workers willing to set foot in the area, and the whole construction was plagued by increasingly unlikely mishaps and disasters. In the end, despite the odds, they got it done.


On the day of the opening ceremony for the refinery, the owner could not be found. His bed had not been slept in, his day clothes were neatly folded on the dresser. The planned party turned into a search operation instead. Late in the evening, they found him. Near top of the hill, there was a barn that had fallen out of use after the construction for the mansion had finished (the second time). The door was bolted from the inside, which is what alerted the searchers that something was amiss. When they managed to hack through the doors, there he was. He was hanging from a noose in the rafters, fifteen feet up in the air. When they finally found a ladder tall enough to get him down, his body was so decomposed it fell apart the moment it was touched. It plummeted down, collapsed on a heap and splattered the already traumatized guests/gawkers with viscera.


Unlike previous fires, we know that the barn burning down the following night was not an accident, but a team effort by the whole town. 


That is Sunnyside. After its gruesome start, it has been a mostly neglected industrial/whatever needs a cheap rental space area. Car shops, a cookie factory that was built on the bones of the old sugar refinery, lumber yard, flea markets, day festivals. Transient places, where no one spends much time, and with owners that have nerves of steel - or are not originally from around here, and don’t know any better. Those ones don’t last.


I didn’t know the street name when I googled it, that was new, but I knew exactly where the activity center was when I saw it on the map. It was the building that had been the old storage for the sugar beets, built where the lore stated the sunken stable had been. When I was a teenager, half the building had been abandoned and collapsed, and the other half had the creepiest flea market one could imagine. Two stories of old steel grate floors, filled to the brim with everything from Victorian era furniture to cheap Chinese sweatshop tat. I loved that place, rarely and in small portions. 

I went to check the place out. I’m not as well versed with old lore as I could be, but I’m not an idiot either. I made sure to time my arrival at noon exactly, with the sun high above and shadows short. I’d tucked my fishing knife into my boot, just in case.


The area looked like time had stopped since I’d last visited. The beige painted, now soot smeared factory buildings towered over overgrown parking lots. Unruly willow boughs tried to encroach onto the cracked sidewalks. Only the shop signs had changed, and the winding road that passed the warehouses had now named intersections where dirt roads branched off of it.


The beet storage was at the end of the last dirt road before a cul-de-sac. The collapsed end of the building had been cleared away, but they hadn’t done anything to the remaining walls. It looked like someone had taken a big cleaver, and cut the building in half - pipe ends and support beams jutted out of the unpainted brick wall. I didn’t see any signs to the activity center, but behind the building, there were some cars in a parking lot. I parked by the side of the road, and walked around the building.


“What the actual fuck?” I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but *damn*. I had found the activity center, and it was… something.


The back wall of the building - where the old loading bay was - had been turned into an entrance to the center. They had added stairs and glass doors to the bay, but that’s not what freaked me out.


They had painted the whole back wall as their sign. You know clowns in every single horror story of clowns, ever? Red hair, pallid face, red nose, dead eyes that are ready to suck in your soul? That. That was their mascot, painted two stories high on the side of the building, with a speech bubble over the door that said “WELCOME TO FUN HOUSE - Sunnyside activity center and gym”


Cool, cool. I liked it when evil made it crystal clear what it was. If it hadn’t been Marten in trouble, I would have filed this as clearly not-my-fucking-problem.


I entered the “Fun” house. Inside it was cool and pleasant, despite the blistering heat we’d been suffering for weeks now. I didn’t see anyone, but I could hear sounds from the hall that had a sign saying “Gym and showers”. I walked to the info desk, looking for a bell. I didn’t find a bell, but instead I found a young clerk, slumped behind the desk, watching something on his phone.


“Hi, I’m looking for help?” I said, and made him almost fall off his chair.


“Yes, sorry, hello! I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you come in,” he said, smoothing his shirt, and hurriedly tucking his phone in his sweatpants pocket.
“Are you looking for a gym membership? Or one of our activity clubs? We have openings in both!” he continued.


“I’m not sure yet, maybe? I was just in the neighborhood, figured I’d come check out the flea market that used to be here. But it seems that it has closed?”


“Yeah, yeah. The flea market closed last year, that’s when Mr Bay bought the building. We opened just this spring, when the renovations were finished.”


“Oh, that’s a shame. I liked that place. You seem to have a cool thing going here tho. The old gym by the river is a dump,” I said and hoped that it was as true as it was twenty years ago, “What kind of clubs do you have?”


The kid fumbled around the desk until he found a brochure, “We have plenty! There's parkour, and minigolf, and bowling, and wall climbing, and we’re planning on opening a rotating themed escape room soon.” 


He handed me the brochure, I put it in my pocket without looking at it.
“I like the sound of parkour and wall climbing. Are those for club members only, or could I visit on an individual basis?” I asked.


“We do sell day tickets, but we do recommend joining one of the clubs. It’s sometimes a bit quiet here outside of them, and we don’t have cameras installed at the premises yet. So it might be risky to go climbing or parkouring without a spotter.”


I nodded, feigning interest, “That makes sense. Could I go see the rooms first, before I decide?”
The clerk paused, then nodded, “I don’t see why not. All the clubs and courses are on a break right now, so you won’t trouble anyone. I’m sure Mr Bay wouldn’t mind either.” 


He handed me a pale green plastic card. 
“Here’s a day pass. I’ll activate it for you, and it’ll be good for all the public areas for today.”


“Thanks. And sorry, I have to ask - what’s with the clown?”


He grimaced, “Owner’s idea of a joke, I think. I know, I *know*. He meant to put up a regular sign, but during the renovations he got, I dunno, ‘inspired’ he said. Give the place that fun old school retro feel.”


“That’s not a word I’d use for it.”


“Neither does anyone else. But it’s his business, so,” the kid shrugged and went back to browsing his phone.

I thanked the kid again and ventured further into the building. The main lobby had signs pointing to different hallways - parkour & wall climbing, bowling alley, the aforementioned gym, locker rooms. The sign to minigolf pointed out of the building, towards the lakeside.


I followed the signs to wall climbing. At the end of the hall, an old metal door opened into a vast open space. Gotta hand it to them, the place had turned out amazing. The walls were covered all the way up on wall climbing paths in different styles. Modern and sleek with plastic handholds, another used the original brick wall with added bricks poking out. One was painted to look like a waterfall with rocks. There wasn’t anything off about the hall, not that I noticed. It was neat, but it was simply a room. I walked around for a bit, checking behind the climbing walls, and listening for anything strange. The only thing behind the walls were pulleys and emergency stairs, and I could hear nothing but the industrial sized air conditioning units and muffled thuds from towards the gym. 


On the wall where I’d come in, there was another door with an electronic lock. “Changing room” was painted over the door. It opened with a quiet beep when I swiped my card on the lock.


“Hello, anyone here?” I called, but got no answer. 


The windowless changing room was vacant, the lights blinked on as I entered. The place was all chrome and white tiling. The white floor gleamed, so did the polished wood benches that sat against the metal lockers on the right side. The opposite wall was a spotless, if slightly misaligned (probably because of the crooked wall behind it) floor to ceiling mirror. It gave me an odd vertigo, seeing the lockers and myself repeated ad infinitum in the wobbly reflection. 


I shook my head and looked away. Some of the lockers had electronic locks and numbers on them, but some were for normal keys. These had name tags taped at the top, I guessed these might be for regular goers and coaches. I checked them one by one, until I found a tag that said “Marten V”. 


After making sure I didn’t see or hear anyone approaching, I took my knife out and wiggled it in the gap between the locker’s frame and the lock. I twisted the knife sideways and up. The latch gave up almost instantly, sliding upwards until the door unlocked with a metallic pang.


The locker was almost empty. A photo of Marten and Lyssa sitting on a porch swing was taped on the door. On the shelves, Marten had left a bottle of shampoo and soap, a towel, and at the bottom of the locker were his climbing shoes. I looked at the shoes and frowned. Something was off about them, but I couldn’t figure out what. I picked them up and turned them on my hand. Fancy ass professional shoes, with neon laces and ergonomic insoles. The soles of the shoes were covered in mud. 


Hold up. Mud. In an indoor climbing hall. I poked the mud, and my finger got slightly damp.


I grabbed Martens towel, and began hurriedly collecting his items into it. When I placed the photo on top of my loot, I realised that it had gotten quiet. No more steady thuds of weights, I didn’t even hear the air conditioning. The lights flickered once, quickly. Well, shit.


Slowly, measuredly, I wrapped the towel into a bundle, and turned around. The room was like it was supposed to look - but its reflection, not so much. It took me a moment to understand what was wrong with it; same room, same benches, same lockers… But no *me*. The pristine white space was empty inside the mirror, and I could have sworn that the reflections kept extending and repeating further as I watched. I snapped my head towards the door, refusing the look at the mirrors, and made my way towards the exit. Suddenly, I heard a squelching sound when I took a step. I looked at my feet. Water and …silt? was pooling between the tiles. 


I ran the last of the way to the door, each step feeling the floor give way a bit more, splashing up muddy water. I swiped the card. The door gave a sad “beeeeeee-eeeeep” and didn’t open. 


Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I held Marten’s towel in one hand, my knife and card on the other, and looked at the mirror. The mud that covered the floor, extended into the reflection. No. It was leaking *from* it. It reached as far as I could see, rising rapidly in the mirror-side. Between the benches and lockers, shadowy, almost translucent reeds swayed in the distance.


And something else. A figure was approaching from the furthest reach of the reflection. Something tall, thin, barely darker than its surroundings, was coming towards me. I fumbled behind me with the card. This time the door didn’t even deign to beep at me. 


“I’m not of this house,” I called at the approaching shape, “I am one of the old families from the Greenriver stead, I have no quarrel with you.”


I could feel wind blowing from the mirror. It smelled of wet earth and mildew. The shape was closer now, and it and the reeds were gaining color and substance. It was clearly not-human, even if human shaped. It didn’t seem to hear me, or it didn’t care.


“I apologize for my trespassing. May I please leave in peace?” I tried again. No reaction. The mud was now high enough to seep into my shoes.


Look, I’m a simple man who likes simple solutions. I set my bundle and knife on top of one of the lockers.


“I truly am sorry for the affront,” I said, grabbing one of the benches. With all my strength, I threw it at the mirror.


For a moment, the reflection paused. The reeds halted mid-sway, the wind stopped. Then cracks appeared on the mirror's surface, and the wall imploded into a thousand shards. I blinked. The mud was gone. The room was normal, except sans mirror. Rhythmic thumping from the gym commenced. My shoes were still wet.


I grabbed the towel, swiped the card yet again - this time, the door opened obediently - and I hightailed out of there right past the clerk who’d been running towards the changing room.


I burned all of Marten’s things (and my own shoes) at the first firepit I found by the lakeside. Late the same evening, Lyssa sent me a message, “Thank you”. So I guess that solved that.


But the activity center is going to be a serious problem. Both on a general, and personal level.


This morning when I went to shave, for a split second, I was not in the reflection. And my bathroom rug was soaking wet.


I’ve smashed every mirror in my house, but I don’t think that’s going to be a permanent solution.
