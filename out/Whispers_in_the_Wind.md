We have all heard the wind, but how closely have you listened?

My name’s Cole. A stonemason, like my father. He carved skyscrapers out of granite. I’m more down-to-earth. I crafted gravestones.

Retired now, I’ve become a grave rubber. No, not *robber*. I search old cemeteries for interesting headstones and make chalk rubbings on paper. Some beautiful, some bizarre, I sell them online to other “tombstone tourists,” who frame them as art.

A few weeks ago, I was working the overgrown burial ground of a tumbledown church, trying to get done before an approaching storm hit, when it started. 

The wind... called to me. 

A soft female voice whispered in the wind: *“Help me...”*

What? Surely, I was mistaken. But then, the wind picked up... and the voice rose too: *“Please... help me...”*

I looked at the inscription on the drawing paper taped to the headstone: *Felled By Flu. 1919*. Back then, the influenza epidemic took more Americans than five wars, many buried unknown.

As I listened, it seemed she was saying: *“I... have... a... name. Pleassse... help.”*

“What... what do you want?” I asked, though I couldn’t believe any of this was real.

*“I want my... name,”* was her wind-whispered reply.

I’m not a fanciful man, nor a drunkard. This was not a dream. I asked a question to the air and the air answered. 

“Are you here... in this grave?” I asked. 

*“Yessss...”* She sighed as the wind quickened. Thunder rumbled in the distance, an autumn storm coming fast.

“Who are you?” I called.

*“Addie...”* came the reply, *“Addie... Sssimpson”*

“Addie Simpson...  what do you want?” I yelled over a crash of thunder and lightning.

Addie pleaded: *“My name... tell them my name...”*

I ran for my truck as the storm clouds broke, and rain pelted down. I headed for the University’s library, thirty miles away, my mind spinning faster than my wheels. 

With the help of a research librarian, I finally uncovered a mention of Addie in a 1919 newspaper notice.

“Adelaide Simpson, 17, of Farmington, has gone missing. If you have any information, contact Sheriff Barton.”

I drove home that night knowing what I needed to do.

I opened my workshop. First time since the day I carved my wife’s stone. 

I had saved a nice piece of marble – deep green with golden-green veining – to use for my own remembrance someday. I set to work through the night, shaping, refining, delicately engraving, polishing to a mirror-glaze.

At dawn, I fell asleep, exhausted, still holding a chisel. My sleep brought me dreams, visions of what this Addie Simpson might have been like, setting off to find her place in the world.

Saying: *“Pardon me, sir. I am new to town (cough) and in hopes of a job...”*

Or... my dream turning darker, I wondered if she had been preyed upon by some man. With able-bodied men off fighting World War I, women had more opportunities... and more exposure to wicked men remaining.

Crying: *“No... sir! Leave me be! No... noooo...”*

Nooo! I woke sweating, infected by curiosity and terrible suspicion. 

I hauled the stone to Addie’s grave and set it firmly in place. It gleamed in the gold of the setting sun. For the first time in a long time, I smiled. It felt good to be a Memorial Mason again, crafting remembrances of people lost that tell generations to come, “I was here. I was loved.”

As I turned away, a gust of wind softly whispered, “thank you,” and then faded to a long, satisfied sigh. But I wasn’t quite done yet. Addie had told me another name and asked for one more favor.

In the iron-fenced enclosure nearest the church’s ruins, I found the ornate monument marking the remains of Sheriff Hubert Barton – the corrupt monster who did her in and left her in the woods.

It was easy to chip his name off, leaving just an ugly stone scar.

Problem is, these days, when I go out into old graveyards to take rubbings, I can barely hear myself think. All those dead people, asking for help. 

*“Find my sister!”*

*“Who stole my wedding ring?”*

*“I’m alive. Dig me up!”*

I am seriously considering changing my hobby to woodworking.
