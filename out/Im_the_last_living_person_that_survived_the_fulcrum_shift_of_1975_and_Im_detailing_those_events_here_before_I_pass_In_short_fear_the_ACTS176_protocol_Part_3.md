**Acts 17:19-23** (About 10 verses after the passage that mentions *“the men that turned the world upside down”*)

*“And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.” Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.”*

*“So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.* *For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription:”*

*“‘****To The unknown God****’”*

There are plenty of variations of the bible, each with their own nuances and modified passages, but as far as I can tell, none of them contain additional mentions of *“the unknown God”*.

Note the language the scripture uses here, too.

It’s not *an* unknown God, no.

It’s ***The*** unknown God.

\- - - - -

Twenty-three hours after the shift, a booming, metallic voice unexpectedly cut through the atmosphere.

*“Brothers and sisters…we stand together on the precipice of paradise. Blissful eternity awaits all, each and every soul here. The Good Lord only asks one thing of you in return…”*

Barret paused; a shrill crackle from his megaphone followed. The harsh sound underscored the severity of his next statement.

*“Faith. Your God desires a show of faith. Not even a leap of it, mind you. Just one…single…step.”*

Survivors began crawling out of the woodwork to bear witness to his deadly sermon. Genillé, an elderly Italian widower who lived next door to the pastor, peeked her head out of a flipped window, light brown hair accented with a black splotch of crusted blood that dyed the right side of her scalp. Further down the overturned street, a young boy appeared at their doorframe, conspicuously alone, curling their small body over the side of the partition to see Barrett evangelize. The rumble of a lifting garage door two houses east of ours revealed a mother cradling an infant in her right hand, the other held limply to her side, concealed under a disorderly mess of gauze and tape. There were many more spectators present, I just don’t recall as much about them.

I *may* have even glimpsed Ulysses spying through his drawn shutters, but I’m not confident in the voracity of that detail, given what I discovered later that morning and the way those discoveries color the man in my memory.

Vicious anxiety gnawed at the back of my eyes as I watched the Pastor’s weary flock grow, which was only made worse by my inability to provide a counterargument without the amplification of something like a megaphone. A few minutes into Barrett’s homily, the sky begun to emit an ominous noise: a low, shuddering buzz, like if you were to record the thumping of helicopter blades and then replayed the sound at one-fifth the speed. That sequence of events was an untimely coincidence: the noise both heightened the inherent drama of his sermon and seemingly gave credence to the pastor’s claims of an unfinished rapture accompanied by the howling of an angry god.

I ran my vocal cords ragged screaming my own message, imploring the survivors to just hold out a little longer, but no one could hear me over the crescendoing drone.

*“Listen now…do you hear the humming of our God below? The seething vibrations of the divine? I hate to tell you, folks, but He’s mighty displeased: told me as much during prayer. You’ve all been called home, and yet, out of sheer ignorance or unfathomable cowardice, you’ve chosen to remain.”*

Barret dropped his the tone to a deep snarl, creating a strange and terrible harmony between his voice and the bellowing of our sunken sky as he spoke.

*“You see, I am but a messenger. I, or should I say* ***we***\*,”\* he proclaimed, wrapping a lecherous claw around Regina’s shoulder, *“have only remained to deliver that message,”*

*“But* ***we*** *do* ***not*** *intend to remain much longer. Jump into the arms of your lord, or accept damnation.”*

Each raspy syllable of Barrett’s concluding remark felt like a separate sucker punch to the chest. Perched within our door frame, I was too far away to see the details of Regina’s expression, sitting on the precarious verge of her home’s shattered living room window next to him, two pairs of feet dangling over the vaporous chasm. That said, I didn’t need to catalog the tremors of her lips or the paleness of her skin to understand the liquid terror pulsing through her veins: God, I just felt it.

I shut my eyes and tried to steady my grip on the unlit signal flare procured from our home’s emergency kit. Maintaining concentration was going to be key.

Even if we were to get everyone’s attention, though, Regina’s chances of survival looked grim. I found myself imagining her screams as she plunged into the orange maw of the morning sky. Brooding terror washed over my body like a high fever, numbing my muscles and polluting my thoughts.

Emi already lost Ben, though.

For her sanity, Regina needed to live.

The memory of my husband pulling an ailing Mr. Baker across the street and towards our home suddenly flashed into my mind’s eye - his resolute, selfless focus became a beacon. With every ounce of determination I had left, I held it there. Trapped the image in my skull long enough that it became almost tangible, like luring a ghost into the physical world with a ouija board. When the memory was so vivid that it felt nearly alive, I could sense Ben was with me. He leapt from the confines of the immaterial and into action, valiantly driving my terror away, forcing it to billow out of my lungs as I exhaled like a thick puff of black smoke dispersed by a gust of wind.

Once the last atom of fear had rippled through spaces between teeth, the memory of that great man receded into the background, distant but never truly gone.

I opened my eyes.

My watch turned to *7:14 AM.* As if on cue, I heard a voice lapse through the walkie-talkie, which was propped up against the wall of the overturned atrium next to Emi.

*“A-C-T-S-1-7-6 protocol, fulcrum imminent, 0:16”*

Sixteen minutes until *something* happened.

I leaned my head over shoulder and shouted down into the atrium.

*“Emi! How’s it going down there?*”

*“Just painting the last word now!”* She shouted back, her inflection raw and cracking with emotion.

When my gaze returned to the pastor and his weary flock, I knew we were running out of time.

Genillé had begun to squeeze herself through the window.

On paper, the process might sound peaceful: an elderly woman, brimming with faith and conviction, voluntarily letting go of this world with a graceful flick of her heel, plummeting into a vast ocean of warm sunlight with a smile on her face and a song in her heart. Some sort of perverse advertisement for euthanasia.

Like with most things, however, theory didn’t even loosely match reality.

Because of her advanced age, she wasn’t strong enough to pull her body up to a sitting position on the window, its edge about at the level of her sternum. I could tell that her panic was growing with every failed attempt, as each subsequent attempt was more reckless and frenzied, like she believed her ticket to heaven was gradually drifting away, slipping further from her fingertips with each passing second. Eventually, Genillé tried throwing herself at a forty-five degree angle rather than forward, which caused the side of her hip to crash into the windowsill with enough force that the resulting bounce propelled her over the edge.

Unfortunately, because of Genillé’s diagonal orientation, the crux of her ankle hooked onto the corner of the window as she exited. As a result, the woman discharged two unbridled shrieks of pain: one when the bones in her feet were crushed by her own weight, and another when the circular motion caused by her latched extremity resulted in her forehead colliding against the solid brick below the window. Mercifully, her leg slipped out behind her after that.

By that point, she was either knocked into unconsciousness, dead, or I simply couldn’t hear her screams anymore as she fell further and further into the sky.

As I watched her body vanish within the horizon, I noticed something new stirring within it.

The air below us had become alive with waves of fuzzy, gray sediment, like seeing the stars of lightheadedness without feeling dizzy. A seemingly endless array of faint sparks formed a veil across the morning sky. In rhythm with the droning’s crescendos and diminuendos, the meshwork’s light pulsed, breathing a cycle of brightness and darkness in turn.

Instantly, I recognized the gritty undertow: it was what I had felt lingering in the atmosphere in the days that led up to the shift, just at a much higher intensity.

I hadn’t felt it at all *since* the shift occurred. But now, I was somehow seeing its corporeal form.

*“Mom! Done!”* Emi yelled.

I reached an open hand behind me while forcing my eyes away from the churning gray tide below and back towards Regina. When I felt soft wool against my palm, I grabbed it and began pulling the blanket towards me, fingertips becoming stained with wet paint.

*“A-C-T-S-1-7-6 protocol, fulcrum imminent, 0:13”*

With the blanket curled under my armpit, I took out the hammer from the tool belt around my waist, storing the flare in its emptied slot for the time being.

When I saw the mother slowly inching her way to the mouth of the open garage door, infant still in hand, I redoubled my efforts. Three nails hammered through the wall and the wool to the right of the door frame. Three identically placed nails hammered to the left.

Our makeshift banner was up.

In bright red paint that contrasted sharply with the pure white blanket, it read:

*“****PLEASE DON’T JUMP. SOMETHING HAPPENING SOON. GET INSIDE.****”*

But we didn’t have the mother’s attention, and she was peering over the edge.

Furiously, I pulled the flare from Ben’s tool belt, lit the end, and held it up through the hole created by the banner that now partly covered the door frame.

*“A-C-T-S-1-7-6 protocol, fulcrum imminent, 0:08”*

She turned her head. The fizzing sparks caught her attention.

There was a moment of silent decision. I held my breath.

Hesitantly, maybe even reluctantly, she stepped back from the edge, sat down, and cradled her infant.

Regina watched the exchange intently.

We played our hand. Showed her that not everyone was following Barrett’s dictum blindly. Now, it was down to her willingness to defy him.

*“A-C-T-S-1-7-6 protocol, fulcrum imminent, 0:01”*

Truthfully, I don’t think Barret had any awareness of the directives that motorized the shift. I think he believed whole-heartedly in every fatalistic word that dribbled from his lips. If he was working under Ulysses, though, he would have been trying to convince people *against* jumping.

That’ll make more sense in a bit.

So, acknowledging the heavy irony of it all beforehand, I will admit that what transpired next did actually restore some of my own faith in a god: one invested in maintaining some sense of cosmic justice.

The timing of it was just too perfect.

Barret offered his hand to Regina. Initially, I was heartbroken, because she grasped it. But *Pastor B* must have been exceptionally confident in his daughter’s loyalty (where he goes, she’ll surely follow), because he did not hold it tightly.

The moment he jumped off, Regina threw her body backwards, severing their connection in one brisk motion.

Barrett fell, and his daughter remained.

As the pastor became dimmer on the horizon, one last message transmitted through the receiver of the walkie-talkie.

*“Sotos particles at apotheotic threshold. Generating fulcrum. A-C-T-S-1-7-6 protocol: activated.”*

The droning’s volume became deafening, and the wave of gray sediment began to approach us rapidly.

With a sound like a colossal foghorn swirling around in my ear, I felt my sense of equilibrium recalibrate. When my feet gently drifted from the top of the door frame, I knew to brace myself for impact.

The drone’s pitch became higher, and its tone transitioned from a thrum to the snapping of electricity.

A split second of silence: the eye of the storm. I closed my eyes.

Then a massive *whoosh,* the now familiar sensation of my spine slamming into the wood of my door frame, followed by that dense, gritty feeling of the air rubbing against my skin, which faded away quickly. Before I could even open my eyes, the invisible friction was gone.

When I did finally open my eyes, I witnessed a small miracle.

Barret, falling from the clouds, splattering into the forested area behind his home.

I mentally braced myself, expecting a sort of *corpse rain* to follow his descent, given what I saw through the telescope the night prior: every object, animal, and person lost from the shift, all motionless on the same sheet of atmosphere in the starry night sky. Surely they would fall too, I thought, unlocked from their stasis and with the world reverted to normal.

But nothing else fell. Instead, when I lifted my head to peer into the sky above, prone on my doorstep, I saw our street was contained within a translucent, yellow-tinged dome: a membranous half-sphere that seemed to evaporate slowly into the surrounding air like boiling honey.

Excluding *Pastor B,* of course. He was the only one that came back to earth. Not Ben, not Mr. Baker, not even Genillé.

Somehow, he had selected the *perfect* moment to jump. Perfect in my opinion, anyway.

Barrett didn’t fall far enough before the shift reverted to be caught and absorbed into whatever that membrane was, so when the shift did revert, his trajectory reversed, and he promptly began a meteoric descent to the cold, hard ground.

Rejected by his own rapture, thank God.

\- - - - -

Once I had confirmed Emi was okay, I instructed her to go across the street and bring Regina back to our house. When she asked why I wasn’t coming with her, I told her I needed to check on Ulysses next door.

Which was only a partial lie.

Even though my suspicions had been mounting during the shift, part of me felt like I’d barge into his home and find the old man dead. Or alive and scared out of his wits. At which point, I could chalk my suspicions up to stress-induced paranoia.

Ulysses wasn’t dead when arrived: nor was he in his home for that matter, and calling that place a *home* is a bit misleading.

Initially, I didn’t plan on including what I found within this post. The shift is perplexing enough on its own: why include details that only serve to muddy the waters ten times over? The point was to immortalize a record of my experience on the internet and nothing more.

That was the point when I started, at least. The **Acts 17:6** epiphany revitalized some lost part of myself that cares about the answers to these impossible questions, and that part of me has redirected the goal of this record, I suppose. I mean, that chapter of the Bible includes “men who turned the world upside down”, the only mention of “the unknown God” that there is *anywhere* in scripture, and the characters that are worshiping said unknown God are described to be from Athens. In other words, Greek: like Ulysses.

That can’t all be coincidence, right?

I’ve come around to the idea that there is something to be gained from sharing everything I can remember, even if I won’t be the one around to do anything with the information.

So, in the interim since I last posted, I’ve jotted down everything I can remember about the inside of Ulysses’s *home.*

Perhaps you all will see the connective tissue within it that I never could.

\- - - - -

\-No furniture other than a bed in the corner of the kitchen

\-Majority of the first floor taken up by some sort of generator. Complicated looking, wires and screens and hydraulic presses. When I approached, could almost feel dense/grainy sensation in the air again. Machine wasn’t loud, but it was vibrating.

\-Every wall except one was covered in clocks set to different times. Looked like one of those vintage sets that has locations listed underneath each clock, but these didn’t have any labels. I’d ballpark sixty or seventy total.

\-There was something drawn on the wall without clocks. An image of a bundle of eyes (almost like a cluster of grapes) on top of a metal stalk, high above some city. I did not linger on this image too long because of how it made me feel.

\-Pistol lying on the floor. Not a gun person, didn’t touch it. No visible blood around the area.

\-On the ceiling, there was a silhouette of a person, painted the *exact* same gray as the wave of sparks/sediment. Red line right down the middle, otherwise, no features. Looked like Ulysses’s frame to me.

\-This next part might be trauma talking, but the silhouette seemed to be *flapping* like a tarp in the wind. Only the silhouette - none of the surrounding ceiling. Flapping was most intense by the red line, and it almost seemed like the figure was caving in on itself: appeared as if it could swing open from the center like saloon doors if I was able to reach up and push it.

\-There was a desk hidden behind the generator that I wish I noticed sooner, because I would have maybe had more time with the papers scattered across it.

\-From what I reviewed, most of it seemed like a journal. The parts that weren’t formatted like a journal had pictures of chemical structures with names I didn’t recognize under them. *Sotos* is the only one I remember, but that’s because it came up in the journals too. But there were many more. Only thing I can recall definitively about the others is that they were all palindromes (I.e., spelled the same word if you read them backwards or forwards, like “racecar” or “madam”).

\-The journal discussed how “the land was fertile”. It contained “abnormally high” levels of *Sotos* particles. On a sheet that had the exact date and time of the shift labeled at the top, he detailed “the rite” and “the reaction”.

\-”The rite” seemed to describe the shift, or the circumstances that were required to make it occur. Most of it was completely incomprehensible: a cacophony of numbers and symbols and colors. I do distinctly recall the recurrent image of a rising sun, as well as it saying that “the radius would be about a half-mile”. The idea of a “radius” made me think of the membranous, honey-colored dome.

\-”The reaction” seemed to describe the point of the whole damn thing. The mixing *sotos* particles with some other material that’s confined exclusively to the upper atmosphere was said to “promote the apotheotic threshold”, but that “the nebulous designed these materials to be present but impossibly separate” unless “concocted by the rite”. Once “the rite” ended, “the reaction” would fall to the earth, which could “unlock the gates to human transgression”.

\-He seemed worried that “an excess of organic matter” might interfere with “the reaction”.

And that’s the last thing I remember before I heard a soft footstep behind me, which was followed by a slight pinch in the side of my neck, and then deep, dreamless sleep.

\- - - - -

Emi, Regina and I woke up at about the same time the following day, having all experienced a similar abrupt and artificial-feeling sleep.

There was a note on the counter, which basically informed me that a large sum of money had been transferred to my bank account, and that same sum would be transferred again on the anniversary of the shift every year we kept our mouths shut.

If we didn’t keep our mouths shut, the note promised swift termination.

Our house was spotless. No piano-shaped holes in the roof. All new, pristine furniture. Not even a single mote of dust on any surface.

Same with every house on the block, except for Ulysses’s.

His house was just *gone*.

Vanished like it hadn’t ever been there in the first place.

Emi lived a good life, I think. She seemed, if not truly happy, at the very least contented. Married a lovely young man named Thomas. Never had any kids, which I think relates back to the trauma of losing Ben: essentially, she saw being childless as the only foolproof way to prevent anyone else from experiencing what she had.

Died from pancreatic cancer a few months ago. She didn’t seem devastated. Again, she wasn’t happy, but she was peaceful. Thomas was there, and that was a blessing she did not appear take for-granted.

And that somber note brings the record to date.

I don’t have too much time left on this earth, either. But hell, maybe I’ll pursue some of this. Pull on a few loose threads. See what I can dredge up for those who are interested. Nothing to better to do while I run out the clock.

Before I end, though, a word of warning.

I’ve given you all the signs of the ACTS176 protocol in motion.

If you see them, stay inside. Find a safe place to shift. Don’t leave your home for twenty four hours.

It’s not a rapture.

It’s something else.

Human transgression through the gates of the apotheotic threshold.

*Sotos* particles.

The influence of the unknown God.
