The last time I sat down to write this story, I thought I was going to be able to finish the entire thing in one sitting, but I just couldn’t. While writing the first part felt cathartic, the second piece had just about the opposite effect. It felt like a shadow had settled over me, a constant reminder of my traumas and failures. I spent the past two days on the couch, watching old episodes of television, ordering takeout, and dodging texts from my manager. We’ll see if I still have a job the next time I decide to show up to work. Last night, I drank for the first time in a long time and then stayed up all night beating myself up about it.

But earlier this afternoon, wrapped in a blanket and nursing a mild hangover, I decided that if I’m going to accomplish one thing in my stupid little life, it’s going to be to finish this story. I know that I’ll never truly be free of this, but maybe I can say goodbye, even if I don’t hear it back. And I know that in order to do that, I have to turn to face it one last time. I have to go back to that third night, when the visitor returned to my window and finally told me what it wanted.

\---------------------------------------

I never fell asleep that night after finding the footprints below the living room window. How could I? Those prints haunted me the rest of the day, similar to the gaze that I now felt on the back of my neck at all hours. No matter where I was, I felt eyes on me, tracing along my skin and drilling deeper into my tissue and marrow.

Around 2:00 AM, as I sat in bed, curled up under the blankets with purple bags forming under my eyes, I heard the sound again, just like that first night. I anticipated it by now, but the noise still made my stomach twist and tremble. The last piece of my heart, the tiny portion that had held out hope that I’d be left alone tonight, finally dropped away. And all I was left with was the fear bobbing in my throat, and that terrible, awful sound. Light, irregular, sharp. *Tink. Tink-Tink. Tink. Tink-Tink-Tink.*

Trembling, I turned my head to the left to find what I expected; the finger tapping on the glass again, at the same spot where it had scratched the window on the first night. My heart pounded in my throat as I whipped the covers over the top of my head, the area under the sheets immediately growing hot and stuffy as my breath accumulated in the pocket I’d formed.

“Go away,” I whispered, both to myself and to the finger, my knees curled up to my chest, my comforter sitting heavy over my head, neck, and back. “Go away. Go away. Go away. *Goawaygoawaygoawaygoawaygoaw*—”

The tapping was cut by a screech that caused me to yelp, my comforter falling away as I recoiled. I turned back to the window to see that the sickly yellow nail had dragged itself from the top of the windowpane diagonally downward toward the bottom. The glass had screamed as the finger carved its way along the surface in one sharp motion. The nail stayed where it was for a brief moment, sitting at the point of the arc it had cut into the glass. Then, the thing spoke.

I’ve spent my entire adult life running from that voice. I’ve tried to drown it out, but nothing has ever been strong enough. It was deep and smooth, like the rumbling of an earthquake heard from the ocean floor. Like butter rolling over the strings of a bass guitar. Like complete darkness, pure and black and ancient and all consuming. When it spoke, it was with a gravity that threatened to swallow anything that flew too close to its orbit.

“Let. Me. In,” the creature murmured, soft but deep, low in volume but not quite a whisper. The nail stayed in its place on the window. The glass cracked just a bit from the pressure at the point of contact. I held my breath. I couldn’t speak. The creature repeated itself. “*Let. Me. In*.”

Each word was punctuated, separated out in my mind as complete sentences. It wasn’t asking to be let in. It was declaring that it should be so.

For the briefest moment, something flickered within me, something different than the stew of terror that had been simmering in my guts for the past two days. I wasn’t only scared at that moment. I was also angry. Angry with this creature that wouldn’t leave me alone. Angry at my mother for bringing us here, for forcing me to leave behind the only happy life I’d ever known. Angry at myself for not being stronger, for not seeking help, for being scared and weak.

I was angry enough to have one fleeting, lucid instant of pure stupid courage. I gritted my teeth while tears built in my eyes and whispered, with all the gusto I could manage, “*No*.”

There was silence while the thing processed my answer.

Then it roared.

The screech sounded neither human nor animal, and it made the blood drain from my face as I watched the gnarled hand reach back and *punch* the glass, cracks spider-webbing outward from the place of impact. Then it was… gone. And just like that, it was silent again. I thought surely the creature’s scream would have brought my mom careening down the hall, but I heard no footsteps approaching my room.

I got out of bed. You may be groaning at my stupidity for leaving a place of safety and getting anywhere near that window. And you’d be right to do so. It *was* stupid. But I was a kid, and while the courageous kind of stupidity had all been used up in my one attempt to defy the thing at my window, a different kind remained.

All I had left was the raw, animal stupidity that accompanied outright terror, the kind that made you act against all sound logic, all prescribed action. It was the kind of stupidity that would cause someone to grab for their assailant’s gun during an armed robbery, the kind that makes deer freeze up in bright headlights. It’s why people run up the stairs instead of out the front door when they’re being chased.

Because people are stupid, and they’re even more stupid when they’re scared. And I was very, very scared.

So, I got out of bed, inching along the wall with my ear pressed to it, listening for something, listening for *anything*. Mostly, all I heard was my own heartbeat pounding in my ear that was suctioned to the drywall. I listened, stepped, listened, stepped, inching closer and closer to the window. And when I got to the edge of the frame, I still heard nothing. That’s when my head, my heart, my lungs relaxed. I think the creature knew that, because only then did the hand crash through the window fully, scattering glass across my bedroom floor, into the moonbeam painted along the carpet.

The flesh on the arm was the same mottled gray as the hand, with dark purple spots along its surface and skin folding this way and that along a sagging, wrinkled surface. And it was too long for a normal arm. Far too long.

I screamed, dropping to the floor and crawling under the sill as the hand swiped indiscriminately at the air, trying to grab hold of me. Pieces of shattered glass dug into the skin of my hands and knees, bringing tears to my eyes. I popped to my feet on the other side, backpedaling away but stopped abruptly by my desk that, in my adrenaline high, I’d forgotten was there.

The arm bent around the window frame as if it sensed me from the sound at my desk, then shot toward me with an unnatural speed. The palm was open, the ugly yellow nails glinting in the moonlight. It seized my shirt, its talons nicking me on the chest as it did so, causing me to bleed from three lengthwise razorblade cuts.

My hand thrashed wildly for something, anything, to fight back, and my heels dug into the floor as the thing dragged me toward the window. I could hear the softest, gentlest laughter coming from the other side of the wall. It was a pure mix of rage and ecstasy. Finally, my hand connected with something solid. Porous stone that felt rough on my fingers. The flowerpot my mom had given me a week ago. My hand wrapped around it, and I screamed, all my emotion flooding out of me in a flash, as I brought the flowerpot down on the forearm of the creature.

The thing shrieked. Pottery shattered. Flowers scattered in front of the window, draped in moonlight. Then silence once more. The thing had let go of me, but its arm was still in the room, laying slackened across the broken bottom edge of the window. I could see an imperceptible rise and fall, could hear the thing’s labored breaths. Then it made a sound that it hadn’t made before, and that I never expected it to make.

It cooed. The way a mother hen coos for its chicks. The too-long arm slithered into the room, stopping at the fallen flowers. Then it collected them gently, one by one.

After it was done, it slank back out the window, flowers in hand. Then it was gone. And there was silence. True silence, with nothing lurking behind it. And for the first time, I knew that it had really left. And that I was finally alone.

My mom burst into the room about sixty seconds later to find me with a shattered window, potting soil and glass intermixed on the white carpet, and blood staining my palms and chest. Yet, as she rushed to me and gathered me up, asking questions in a frightened, shrill voice, I didn’t really hear her. I was too focused on staring out the window, a smile plastered over my face that I couldn’t seem to remove.

Because I knew the thing at my window was truly gone. And that was all that really mattered.

\--------------------------------------- 

I shouldn’t have been surprised to find how easily I was able to explain away the things that had happened to my mom. I had sort of expected all along that a kind of veil had been drawn over her awareness of the situation. It was why she hadn’t seemed to notice how strangely I was acting, or the even stranger things happening around the house over the previous days.

I don’t even remember what excuse I gave. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter. As I told her whatever bullshit explanation I could come up with, she simply listened and nodded. She cleaned my hands and knees, vacuumed up the glass and dirt, and bandaged the cut on my chest. She made a comment about getting someone out to fix the window in the morning. Then she went back to bed. And we never talked about it again. I knew if we ever did, she’d likely have already forgotten about the previous conversation, and I wasn’t too keen on bringing it up myself.

I’ll never actually know if mom was visited by the creature, but a part of me knows that even if she was, I’d probably have taken her explanations and promptly forgotten them, just as she did for me. I still doubt she ever was, though, since my room was the only one she’d brought flowers into. I’d checked the house thoroughly the following day to be sure.

Mom continued to build her garden, but she never seemed to draw the thing’s ire the way that I had that week. Taking the flowers from the forest and replanting them in the ground seemed to not violate the creature’s boundaries. Carrying the flowers into our home, severing their ties to the earth, putting them in a room devoid of sunlight, that was what the creature deemed profane, and it never knew that, even though it was my room, I hadn’t been the one to place them there. It marked me as a thief and made me the target of its rage.

I never let mom bring flowers into the home again. Every time she did, I’d make up an excuse that I couldn’t stand the smell or that I was allergic, faking a cough and all. Eventually, she stopped trying to brighten the home with them. Our house was never quite as vibrant as before, but that wasn’t only because of the flowers.

The week after the incident was the happiest week of my entire life. It still is, even today. Because it was the only week where my life was truly quiet. Looking back, I would have appreciated it more, done all the things I hoped to do at the time. I would have *lived*.

I had assumed that with its flowers reclaimed, the creature wanted nothing more from me. I thought that it would finally leave me alone. These assumptions are of course built on a much larger, central assumption; that the creature is logical, and that it thinks and acts like a human. That was a mistake. Looking back, I even think my one week of bliss was the thing’s idea of a cruel joke, giving me a hint of freedom before reeling me back in.

In the past fifteen years, I’ve learned almost nothing about whatever this creature is. But I *have* learned two basic truths that have stood the test of time. It is capable of deep and profound anger. And its focus is perfect, unwavering, and unbroken. Ultimately, it didn’t matter that it got its precious flowers back. It didn’t matter that the loop had been closed.

Because there was no loop to close on its hatred of me. And it no longer wanted something tangible from me. Instead, it wanted my pain. After my week of quiet, I was roused from my sleep once again.

It was a voice, deep and booming, and it spoke not in a question, but a declaration that something should be so.

“Let. Me. In,” it croaked, accompanied by a sharp irregular sound. A single nail, tapping on glass. *Tink. Tink. Tink-Tink. Tink.*

 \---------------------------------------

I didn’t let it in that night, or any of the others before tonight, where I sit now, trying to finish this story. At first, I thought the silver lining was that the creature didn’t seem to want to harm me, or that maybe it couldn’t. Now I know it was subjecting me to something far worse.

Because it didn’t just come to visit in the night anymore. It came in the morning, too, as I got ready for the day. It was hiding around corners as I went to school that semester. I saw it in the reflection of storefronts and bathroom mirrors and the windows of passing cars. In all my classes, it was tapping at the windows, even on the second floor, or it was standing on the front lawn of the building, waving at me. I moved from that town as soon as I graduated high school. It followed me from there, and everywhere I moved after that.

No one ever seemed to see it or hear it other than me, and I suspect that it got a perverse sense of satisfaction from that.

Even worse, it isn’t *always* there. Sometimes, I’ll go days or weeks or months without a visit. Other times, it’s everywhere I look for hours on end. I think it keeps its behavior so unpredictable to twist the knife that much more. But even when it leaves, one thing has been universally true: it’ll always be back.

It was even there last week at my therapist’s third-story office, tapping away at the glass in the back corner of the room and breaking my concentration as I tried to recount what had happened to me as a child. I’ve still never told her about the creature’s continued visits throughout my adulthood, only about what happened in my youth. I’m scared of what she’ll think if I do.

Even now, in this quiet moment while I try to write, I sit with noise cancelling headphones on, facing the wall of my bedroom, my back to the window. But even here, I can still somehow see it, just out of the corner of my eye. It’s right there, just as it was that first night all those years ago. Tapping at my window. Letting me know that it’s there, and that it’ll never leave me again. And it’ll be there forever, until the day that I decide to open the window, welcome it in, and end the noise once and for all.
