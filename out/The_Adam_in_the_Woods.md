Hi, I don’t really know how to start writing this. I’ve written and rewritten this over and over, so I think I’ll just get into it. The situation is not only devastating but also hard to explain. 3 weeks ago, my boyfriend Adam and I went to my parents’ house for a mini vacation. I won’t get into it because it’s irrelevant to what is currently happening, but I will say that there was drama between our friend group and us, so we needed time away. Adam in particular was super excited because behind my family home is a dense set of woods, and Adam loves nature and hiking and all that. Adam and some of his friends have a group chat where they post nature pictures that they personally take, so Adam planned on doing that a few times while at my parents’ house.

It happened a few days after we settled into my old room, early in the morning Adam tells me that he’s going out to explore and take pictures. I decided to stay behind, I know it’s childish but when I was a kid, I thought I saw a man in the woods and shortly after a girl went missing nearby so the woods still freak me out. I expected him to be gone for 2 hours at most so at the 3 and a half hour mark I started to get nervous, but my dad told me not to worry about it. He changed his tune at the 6-hour mark. We called the police, and they started a search. I stayed home in case Adam came back but he didn’t come back that night. My parents told me that he’ll probably turn up soon, that he probably got lost or stuck somewhere and I think their right or at least I used to.

It's been 2ish weeks since Adam went missing but a few nights ago I have woken up in the middle of the night to someone knocking on my window. I can’t clearly see who it is, but the silhouette looks like Adam. Something feels off about it, it fills me with this kind of dread that I have only ever felt when I look at the woods. If it was Adam, why doesn’t he just come in? The silhouette also looks kind of off putting, like I don’t remember Adam being that tall. I want it to be Adam, but I can’t shake this feeling that it isn’t really him. I don’t know what to do about it and my parents aren’t taking me seriously, they tell me it’s just stress dreams. Is it? It feels so real, and last night the knocking got way more intense than it was before, he was even scratching at my window violently and it sounded like someone was trying to do an impression of a person crying if that makes any sense. This morning, I could see the scratches on the window, and they look really bad, super deep but looks like they were made with human hands by the spacing of them. You could tell that whoever did this used all five of their fingers, but My dad said that maybe it was a raccoon or something but I’m not too sure. My he still isn’t taking me too seriously he seems more upset about the scratches and said he had to make a phone call. Am I losing it? I really miss Adam and even if it creeps me out, should I let him in? I need advice about what to do because I’m freaking out, I don’t think I can trust myself to make a smart decision right now.
