My first memory of her was when I was about six years old. I didn’t quite understand why I knew someone who looked so similar to me. I remember having an unbreakable bond with her. 
 
She would be with me more often than not and would keep me company even when everyone else would abandon me. She would help me where I fell weak and would support me on the darkest of days. She was truly a light of ray in my life. 
 
Everything was going well in life. We had passed high school and had planned on going to the same college and even studying the same major. She and I had bucket lists that took up multiple pages! It seemed as if I could not see a future without her, as she could not without me. 
 
Or at least it seemed that way until one fateful fall morning when she was found dead. 
 
So I started to wonder: what had happened? 
Why did she do it? 
I may have finally found an answer. 
 
Initially, I thought it may have been accidental, not intentional. However, my doubts were promptly cleared after the coroner’s report ruled it a death by suicide. 
 
Naturally, I decided to go digging through her things. I didn’t find anything that might have pointed to an answer at first glance. Only upon a thorough investigation did I discover ‘notes’ that did not belong in a notebook for English  notes. 
 
Every couple of pages had had a diary entry made into them. The entries were dated from up to a year ago to last week. They weren’t very frequent; only one entry every couple of weeks or months.
 
My eyes tried to skim the writing to look for clues. The entries stated:
 
Saturday, 15th of October
It has begun again. The darkness is insanely vast—supposedly nothing, and yet everything that I feel. I cannot tell her, for she will be worried. I must try to let it pass.
 
 
Thursday, 23rd of November
Why won’t the dust settle? Will it ever settle? It has been swirling like a storm in this mind of mine for longer than I wish to remember. I wish it would end.
 
 
Monday, 8th of January
The end has no sight. I try and will always try to never give up, but I fear I was not built for this world. The signs have always been there. 
 
Why must I deny signs that are unwaveringly etched into my mind?
 
 
Wednesday, 31st of January
My soul is heavy, and I do not know if I can describe the happenings of recent days. He has taken over my life now. 
 
 
Friday, 15th of March
The signs get louder and more opaque with every passing second. He is always there, always watching. I fear things may escalate soon.
 
 
Saturday, 13th of April
The emptiness echoes endlessly into my ears. The threads of my soul unspool and unravel everywhere. They unravel faster than I can spool them back in. 
 
 
Thursday, 6th of June
He has started testing the waters to see how I will react. There is no winning and no losing. Only giving in. 
 
 
Saturday, 20th of July
The ebony hours are most dangerous. There is no solace in them anymore. No hope of recovery or relief.
 
 
Monday, 5th of August
He gets bolder by the day. His meek stature may have everybody fooled, but only I truly know what hides behind his seemingly innocent act.
 
 
Tuesday, 15th of October
He has taken things beyond a tolerable limit. My mind can no longer endure it. 
 
 
Thursday, 17th of October
Help did not come.
I am deeply sorry to everyone. I love you.

I sat alone with my thoughts. I tried to register what my eyes could not comprehend. How could I not have seen any signs? How did I not notice any changes in her behaviour?
 
As if right on cue to break the silence and cut through my hurtling thoughts, the doorbell rang, and I hurried to open the door. 
 
In walked nobody other than my neighbour and one of my oldest friends. He asked me how I was coping with the loss of my twin. I simply hugged him in response and motioned for him to sit in the living room while I went to get something to pack up her things and get something to eat from the kitchen. 
 
As I picked up the book to keep it back, my gaze fell onto a peculiar drawing she had sketched on one of the pages.
 
It showed a young, tall man with brown hair with the words ‘rapist’ written next to it. 
 
The very same young, tall man with brown hair who was in my living room.
