Hello again, it’s me. I’m so so glad that you guys liked the first bit of my story - that really was just the beginning. Thank you for the kind words about my work, too - I really feel like I don’t deserve it. 

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marielle and I am 36 years old now. 

When I introduced you all to my cottage and the bit of magic behind my work, I started with one of my easiest and most palatable guests. She just happened to be the most recent. 

Let’s go back a bit. 

My first year working here, I didn’t own The Cottage alone. A wonderful woman by the name of Cassandra trained me in the business of witnessing the weight of choices. 

Sandy was in her late seventies, with coiled silver hair and about a hundred different glasses frames to go with any outfit she may like to wear. She was tall, probably six feet before age had slouched her, and built like a bean pole. She was one of those people that folks say “light up a room.” 

Her brown eyes turned golden in the sunlight, and that was the version I saw the most, because she was very often outside. In the backyard of The Cottage was her real pride and joy - her garden. She had fruit bushes that had been alive for longer than I had, and every year she dared herself to grow something new for our guests to eat. 

“Will you try to keep this going once I retire?” She had asked me this question while her dark-skinned arms were elbow deep in dirt that smelled vaguely of cow shit. I curled my lip, but nodded, determined to follow in her footsteps as well as I could. Determined to make her proud. “You don’t have to keep the whole veggie garden, or you could hire someone to tend it. But the fruits - my blueberry bushes, the strawberries, the blackberries and raspberries. I’ve tended them for almost fifty years, darling. They are my legacy more than this cottage is. The Cottage is aided by magic or mysticism or something like that. This?” 

She stood up on knees that were still inexplicably dexterous for her age and stepped back to gesture at the fruit section. “This is hard work. This is devotion and love. These are more my children than my actual children are.” 

Cassandra laughed, a sound that was melodic and joyful and brighter than a full moon on a clear winter’s night. 

She died about a year after that conversation, peacefully in her sleep. When I found her she still had a smile on her face. 

The night after she died and the Waldo County Sheriff’s Office had managed the removal of her body, the first night I was truly alone and in charge of The Cottage - that was when Nicolas stayed with me.

July 22, 2021

I was working at my desk, staring out the window into the foggy woods beyond what my porch lights could cover. The weather had been mild in temperature but the humidity was obscene; I felt like I could swim in the air. 

I was waiting for headlights. It had been a week since we had our last guest, and Cassandra had taught me the patterns. Always be prepared for guests, but expect them if it’s been five days or more. Be ready and in uniform. Back in those days, that included a clean but disposable mask in my blazer pocket. 

It was closer to one in the morning when I heard the knock. The sound startled me out of my treeline-staring trance and I jumped to my feet, rushing to open my front door. I smoothed my face back to the polite and professional expression I wore so well and swung it open to greet my guest. 

He was a young man, maybe thirty, and criminally handsome. Tall, well muscled, with a gorgeous smile and an even more gorgeous crooked nose that sat perfectly placed below stormy gray eyes. In a past life, the man on The Cottage’s porch would have swept me off my feet and had my heart in an instant. 

Except this was my current life, not my past life, and gorgeous men with gorgeous smiles did not show up at The Cottage. I straightened my spine and ushered him in, preparing my typical speech, reigning in the assumptions I couldn’t find myself able to control. “Fifty a night, no holds,” I stammered. One of his dark eyebrows raised in amusement. “If you choose to stay an extra night, we rerun your card up here again.” 

“Just one night.” I held out my hand politely at his words, waiting for his card and identification. He fished in his pocket for several seconds before handing both to me, each in horrific shape. I could still read through the clouded lamination on his Maine license - Nicolas W., born in 1989. He was my age exactly: thirty two. 

I pulled the key for suite two out instinctively before I remembered. Suite one was vacant again - I lived in the main house now. With a tiny shake of my head to clear the grief, I took out the correct key - heavy, iron, tagged with a bold printed 1. “Suite one, first door on the right. Breakfast is at eight tomorrow. It is just you and I, so I am all yours.” 

Both of his eyebrows raised this time at my phrasing, but instead of making me blush like the gesture should have, my skin crawled. 

I couldn’t place why. Not yet. Maybe tonight, when I learned who Nicolas was underneath his manicured exterior. 

Calling what I saw in my sleep a dream is generous. I saw Nicolas as a boy centuries ago, playing in a vast nursery and speaking a language that I wasn’t certain of - Italian, perhaps. I dreamt of that young boys death, of those stormy eyes clouded over from the pain of tuberculosis at no more than nine years of age. I dreamed of the very little light that was there flickering out with a ragged exhale from the boy’s cracking lips. I dreamt of his favorite way to break his fast - porridge sweetened with honey, ripe figs, and scrambled eggs with crackling crystals of salt. 

I dreamt of a mothers grief, of rage so profound it echoed through my rib cage, of pain so deep it may rival Mariana’s Trench. The rage and the grief and the pain brought that woman who spoke that language I didn’t understand to someone in a profession I could recognize anywhere. 

I dreamt of a beautiful young woman with dark brown eyes, full lips, and hair down to her waist murmuring condolences and promises to the mother before her - the mother who immediately dropped a pile of gold worth more than my whole property into the palm of that witch’s hands. 

I dreamt of when the boy returned, but he did not have the same innocent light in his eyes. His mother did not see it, or perhaps chose not to see it. Her boy was back, but he was dreadfully, painfully wrong. 

I dreamt of a boy who did not sleep, of a boy who aged into beauty that caused all the young ladies around him to swoon. The boy became a young man, and I dreamt of that young man bedding woman after woman and leaving them missing something they’d never known they had. 

I dreamt of a boy who consumed not food, but souls. A young man who gained energy not from rest, but from theft. Every time he found a woman below him, he grew more beautiful, more adept at the art of seduction. 

I dreamt of him traveling across continents over decades. The young man learned that he was not normal, that the reason he lived was no longer love but pain and grief and rage. He crafted a past for wherever he landed. He broke every willing lady who was unlucky enough to cross his path. 

I dreamt of a man who never had to use force to take what he hungered for, he only had to flash his beautiful smile or wink one of those stormy gray eyes. Of a man who never coerced or manipulated, only flirted, only seduced. He never afflicted a woman with an illness or with a child - he never left behind a thing at all. He only took and took and took.

Nicolas stole. He was no longer a man with a soul, so he took tiny pieces of every person unfortunate enough to open a bit of their own to him. I dreamt of faces I recognized from my guests, guests who all were hollow in ways I never could fill with food or talk or anything at all. Every woman over time that he had brought behind closed doors appeared in my dreams - some long dead, some still cursed with a life missing parts of themselves. 

I woke up and vomited immediately. The clock only read five past four in the morning, but I felt I must have been dreaming for days. The man my exact age pretending to sleep in the room that I used to sleep in was the worst kind of monster I’d encountered yet. 

All of my guests before him, the ones Cassandra had allowed me to help - they were missing pieces of themselves due to something behind their control. I supposed this was still true from Nicolas - he did not intend to become a soulless monster who couldn’t die, his mother had inadvertently made him one. My other guests almost exclusively harmed without intent to do so, but not Nicolas. 

I had dreamed it. I had dreamed of the sickening joy he felt each time another piece of soul was swallowed by the blackness where his own should have been. I had lived it through his eyes. I had witnessed the discovery of how he could feel alive again, and I had witnessed him choose to continue. I had watched women sob in their new emptiness and confusion as he left the room just a bit more beautiful, a bit more young than he was before. 

I vomited again and did not go back to sleep. I hurled open the door to the basement and ran down the narrow staircase to where Cassandra kept her own journals and began to search. 

Nearly fifty years of tending The Cottage meant that Sandy encountered people and creatures that I could only begin to imagine. The books in the safe - a safe locked behind a combination she’d only told me through her estate - held the answers to secrets I didn’t know that I didn’t know. 

I rummaged through journal entry after journal entry, learning of monsters who looked like mere men and mere men who looked like monsters, but nothing of the monster who wore the face of the most beautiful man I’d ever seen. 

While I didn’t learn exactly what Nicolas was from these secret journals, what I did learn is that I did not live in the world I thought I did, and with that knowledge I reconsidered my plan of action. Monsters like Nicolas existed, and would no matter what. If I left him and did nothing, the planet would certainly continue to spin, but could I live with myself? 

Breakfast came together with a swiftness I had not been aware I possessed. Porridge, figs, eggs, homemade bread, fresh pressed juice - it was a meal freshly made and fit for wealth. I prepared the finest of coffees using the most expensive beans, poured myself a cup, and waited while I drank it black.

Nicolas appeared in my doorframe at 7:59am, his smile still charming and his eyes still stunning. He was looking at me like I was prey. 

Probably because to him, I was. 

I pulled out his seat for him and he dipped his head in gratitude. I clenched my jaw, willing myself not to flinch in the way my instincts urged. I filled his plate with what I knew were his favorite things and while he ate, I spoke. 

“I know what you are.” He did not look up from the food he was devouring, but the fork he was raising to his mouth stilled for half a moment before continuing on its journey. “I know what you do, and I have seen the wreckage you leave behind. I have witnessed more women than I can count on two hands who are lacking a piece of themselves because of your particular appetite.” 

Nicolas was watching me now as he ate, his eyes unblinking. He still did not interrupt me, so I carried on. “You are a monster among men who takes advantage of beauty that others would view as an incredible blessing. I know it is a curse. You were meant to die in 1762 as a little boy, and when your mother went to that witch who lived the same curse that she gave you, she severed a thread of fate that should never have been unbroken. You were not reborn from love, you were reborn from pain, and now you are wrong. But Nicolas, I know something you do not.” 

My guest was now lounged back in his seat, his posture relaxed and lazy. I bit back the surprising need to growl at him. “If you stop stealing pieces of the people around you, you can right yourself. You can die. You didn’t know this, I know you didn’t, because it’s not something you’d have ever considered. Gorging yourself on other’s emptiness tastes far too sweet to fast from, doesn’t it? Sex is too good, and it gives you too much power. You could stop, though.” I paused and watched as I delivered my final blow, promising him what knew he hungered for more than anything. “You could sleep again, Nicolas.” 

His reaction was not what I’d desired - no visible shock, no gasp, and barely a flicker of interest. “I’ve lived over two hundred and fifty years. I have more wealth than your pathetic billionaires could hope to acquire. So tell me, child,” he spat the word, “why would I give all I have gained up just to rest?” 

I did not answer him, because he was not really asking me. He did not need an answer to a question that wouldn’t have helped him decide what was already chosen. 

“Did you see that woman was the one who told me what I could do to be just like her? Ageless, rich, powerful. Did you see that I could have been changing other lost souls to be like me just like she did, but I have not done so? Did you see all the times I have hungered for the sweetness of a woman’s soul but abstained because I respected their lack of consent?” Of course I had - but he didn’t want to hear me speak. That’s not what that time was for, not anymore. “Did you know that your soul smells of wildfire and spiced rum and untouched mountain water? Did you know that the grief that you carry reeks of necrosis? I could ease that pain, and take away that darkness. If I really wanted to, if I set my mind to it, I could have you. But if you allowed me, I could drink that sweetness and cure your rot by bringing back your little girl.” 

I froze. How could I not? My beautiful girl. I could smell her hair again, I could hold her in my arms. I could choose to ignore her wrongness if he brought her back just as his mother had done. 

My jaw clenched and I ground my teeth. Unlike his mother, I knew the consequences of that choice. 

“Intriguing, isn’t it? I’d do it, if you let me take just a tiny little piece of your soul. I’ve never gifted another with this life. But you…” Nicolas trailed off as he gazed at me, those gray eyes desperate and hungry despite the food he was still eating.

“No,” I snapped, though my voice shook. His lips curled into a smile. “I would never wish for someone to become the monster you are. Not even her.” 

His smile remained, but he shrugged. “It is your choice, after all. Not the one I’d make, but still, it is yours.” Nicolas ate more of his meal and drank more of the coffee. “Do you believe in God?” 

His meal vanished as I stared, refusing to answer his question. He stood while wiping his mouth with a napkin. “I only take pieces of souls. God takes it all.” He grinned, his teeth too perfect, his eyes too bright. “Compared to God, am I really such a monster?” 

Nicolas left The Cottage on foot, the same way he had arrived. That night, I dreamed of lies that tasted like burnt coffee, and I dreamed of that same sickening joy - the joy of owning a part of someone that they can never get back. I dreamed of it over and over and over, as if to spite me. As if he knew I would feel it. I dreamed of him touching my daughter’s picture in an aged newspaper and woke up to the necrotic grief eating me anew. 

——

I have not had the misfortune of seeing Nicolas again, and for that I thank whatever powers that be every day. I have still dreamed of the holes he leaves behind, more times than I can count now. He is still out there somewhere. 

The Cottage is a crossroads, but not everyone takes the right turn. Hell, not everyone even has the option to turn right at all. Nicolas is tall, with sandy blond hair and eyes like a Kansas thundercloud, and he wants to get you in bed. His voice is gravelly and alluring and his smile is exceptionally charming. He’s not even that bad to talk to. 

But Nicolas did not make the good choice at The Cottage, and he’s out there still, stealing pieces of people that can never be returned or refilled. If you see him, or any other person who matches that description - too charming, too beautiful, too alluring - run. Turn and run and don’t look back and don’t get in bed with them. 

Because I really don’t want to see you as a guest here.
