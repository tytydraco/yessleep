I got the call around three thirty in the morning. Much to my boss’s surprise, I was actually awake. 

“Jesus Christ, Ollie don’t you ever sleep?” he asked as I answered the phone. 

“Takin’ a piss boss,” I said, omitting the part where I imagined doing it on his smartass face. 

“Lovely. Well… Zip up and come to the precinct. We got news about the Knightslayer,” he snapped back. Suddenly I was at full attention and asked him a dozen questions. 

“News? Tell me now. You know I've been on that case all year. Did he kill again? Was I right about the timing?” 

“Slow down. Look… it’s a lot to process and I’d rather not do it over the phone,” the captain answered. 

I told him I’d be there in twenty minutes. I actually made it there in twelve. 

As I came in, all the night shift workers gave me a look like I was crazy. I probably looked half asleep and poorly dressed but I didn’t care. I went straight to my captain’s office. 

“Detective Cote, take a seat,” he said as I closed the door. He had a look on his face that told me something was off. 

“I’d rather stand if it’s all the same to you. Just spill the beans. What’s going on with the Knightslayer? Did he kill again?” 

“Nothing like that actually… As it turns out, he was found dead about an hour ago over at the docks. Looks like it was a suicide,” he told me. 

I should have been happy. I should have gone to buy the whole department a round of beers. But instead when he told me the news I just felt hollow and angry inside. 

“Suicide? That doesn’t make sense. He was following a pattern. Killing every thirteen days like clockwork and this next victim would have been lucky number thirteen… did someone find a note?” 

“Oliver, he was found in the water by a fishing merchant. It’s pretty obvious he jumped. The coroner is going to perform an autopsy but I’m guessing that this is a closed case for us,” my boss told me. 

I looked over at our crime board, confused by all the leads and clues we were following to catch this guy. We had discovered so much about what type of person he was, but had been unable to pinpoint a location. He was like a ghost, and he was always one step ahead. 

It felt so unfinished this way, I thought as I saw all of the different scribbles I had written down. 

“I want to see that coroner report. And I want to know everything about this guy,” I told him. 

“Not sure what we can find out that we hadn’t already. We knew he was from out of state, and we had properly identified that tattoo. My guess is that he knew we were getting close and offed himself before getting caught. I’ve seen that happen plenty of times,” my boss said with a shrug. 

“That can’t be the end of it. We still don’t know who the first victims were.” 

“And we probably never will. This is exactly why I wanted to talk to you alone. You were obsessed, Cote. But this is an official order to drop it. The killer is dead. We’ll get an ID and pull prints from the corpse but it’s pretty much a cut and dry thing,” he told me. 

I was doing my best not to punch him in his face. 

“Captain… with all due respect, it  can’t be over until all the victims get justice. We still don’t know where some of their bodies are. Those families need closure,” I told him. 

“And once the coroner verifies it, I will be announcing tomorrow morning at the Knightslayer serial killer has committed suicide.  Can’t get more happy ending than that,” he said dismissively. 

It left a bitter taste in my mouth. As awful as this sounded I wanted the drowned man to be someone else. This killer was too smart, too prideful to just end things like this. 

But that isn’t how it all went down. 

The next day just as predicted, the coroner confirmed the cause of death was drowning. I watched the news conference from home with a beer in my hand. The Captain made vague promises that the police would make sure that there was justice, but I knew it was empty words. It was over.  We had pursued this prick for a year and now he just decided to play his trump card. 

It was enough to make me want to get drunk. 

And that’s exactly what I did. 

A week later I got that coroner report and found that the killer’s name was Mike Haversen. He was a former butcher and tattoo artist, which actually fit in with the profile we had created. 

“Open and shut,” I muttered in frustration as I slid the report away. 

There was nothing I could do except drown myself in booze and work. 

I chose the former more often than not. 

That sense of unresolved frustration never went away though, no matter what I did. 

It lingered for a little over a year…. Until one day we got a call from a local hospital, a call that changed everything I thought I knew. 

“So it turns out, Haversen had a kid. Apparently he’s been in a coma for almost thirteen months,” my partner Renee told me. 

“A kid? Nobody checked that out?” I asked. 

“Not exactly something we had at the top of our list, Ollie. Anyway, the kid wants to talk. Didn’t say what. But he did request to speak to the lead detective of the case. Guess that’s you,” she said, slapping me a sticky note that had the hospital address and the kid’s name on it.

Arthur. I guess that explained the Camelot metaphors that the killer used to use, I thought sourly. 

“Did they say what caused the coma?” 

All she did was shrug. 

But it didn’t take long for me to find out. Arthur was all the buzz at the hospital when I got there. And one story was at the top of everyone’s gossip, he had been put into a coma by his father thirteen months prior. 

As it turned out, that was also the time frame when the Knightslayer had begun to kill. 

I had no idea if that was a coincidence or not but I was eager to hear what this kid had to say. 

When I stepped into his room, he looked like shit, still hooked up to a few machines and if I’m being honest I was second guessing myself about talking to him. He wasn’t in any shape to hear the truth about his old man. 

I was just about to step back into the hallway when I heard his weak voice call my name. 

“Detective Oliver Cote?” 

I gave him a curt nod, asking if he needed a drink or anything. 

“What I need right now, is to ask you if my father is really dead,” he said. 

“I can’t lie to ya kid, the news has it right. He drowned himself yesterday.”

Arthur seemed relieved. “I’m sorry… for all the hurt he has caused,” he told me. 

“You don’t have anything to apologize for. You’ve been down and out ever since the first victim.” 

“But that’s just it, detective… if I hadn’t been in this coma… I think I could have stopped him a lot sooner. In fact I know that I could have.” 

“And what makes you think that?” I asked, scratching my chin. 

“I’m pretty sure he deliberately put me in the hospital because I knew his secret. It took you a little over a year right? And I bet he was careful.” 

I crossed my arms, not sure I wanted to divulge too much info to this kid. 

“I was told that you wanted to share something with the police, Arthur,” I told him. 

“I do… I think I can help you find the bodies of the victims,” he told me. 

I did my best to hide my surprise and temper my expectations. “That would be a pretty big order to fill. He killed a lot of people, some of whom we never found even a shred of evidence,” I told him. 

“I can help. I *want* to help. It’s the least I can do given the circumstances,” he said. 

“I can’t make any promises but I’ll run it by my captain. He’ll probably need something concrete if you really want to be on board with this,” I told the kid. 
Arthur seemed lost in thought for a moment and then gave me an address that was about twenty minutes from the hospital. 

“There’s an old butcher shop there. My dad used to work nights under a different name,” he told me as I wrote it down. 

“And what do you think I will find here?” I asked. 

“Maybe the first step toward closure,” he replied softly. 

I could tell he was getting tired so I excused myself and made a call to my captain. 

I wasn’t too surprised to hear that he wasn’t on board with the idea of having Arthur Haversen lead us on what he called a wild goose chase. 

So I did something risky, and I called my boss’s boss, Deputy Chief Frank Romero. 

I gave him the full rundown of what Arthur was promising and how this could allow the victims to finally bury their loved ones. Basically sold him a sob story. 

“And what does your captain say about this?” Romero asked when I was all said and done. I bit my lip and lied. “He said you had to green light it sir, since officially the case is closed.” 

The phone line remained silent for a long moment and I could hear my heartbeat. 
“Fine. But keep this under wraps for now. No need for anything leaking until we’ve determined if this kid is legit.” 

I called Renee next and told her to meet me at the old butcher shop. 

The building was in a rundown sector of town, where most of the people wandering the streets were either prostitutes or gang members. Renee was already there when I arrived. 

“Gosh Oliver you really know how to spoil a girl,” she said dryly as we heard gunshots off in the distance. 

“You’ve been by my side every step of this damn thing. It wouldn’t be right to say goodbye without ya,” I told her as we found the address. The place was boarded up but I could tell there was still some power on inside. 

“We’ll need a warrant,” Renee pointed out. 

“For an abandoned store? Fuck that,” I said as I kicked the door down. “I heard a scream,” I said with a shrug as I kept my gun ready and we checked every nook and cranny of the dilapidated store. 

“I thought you said that the Knightslayer has only been killing for thirteen months?” Renee asked, clicking her flashlight on. 

“Yeah, why?” 

“Doesn’t this shop seem a bit older than that? There’s no way this place was up and running a year and a half ago. More like a decade,” she pointed out. 

The lights flickered on as we pushed aside an old storage box and found a staircase that led to a basement freezer. 

“Yeah but if this place has been out of commission that long, who’s paying the light bill?” I pointed out as we moved down. Something ahead stunk and we both had to cover our mouths as we scanned the area. There were several large freezers down there, most of which had run out of juice and sludge had formed on the floor. Renee reached the closest one and popped the lid. 

As soon as she did she vomited and stepped away. The overwhelming odor of rotting flesh coming from it was enough to make me want to do the same. 

“That’s definitely a corpse,” she said as we got a better look at it. 

It was obvious that the woman had been preserved for quite a while, but recently the power had been cut off perhaps due to a brownout. 

“There must be a generator closeby,” she said. 

“We need to call this in,” I said as I popped the next freezer open and found another victim. This one was missing its eyes. They had been carved out, likely by the same butcher knife he served customers with years ago. 

I didn’t even dare to look at the others, imagining more grisly cut up bodies within. We stepped back out and got in the patrol car and waited for backup, both of us too stunned by the discoveries. 

Finally, when they started hauling out the bodies in large black bags, Renee asked me about Arthur. 

“I guess the kid was telling the truth. How the hell did he know about this place? And who was making sure these bodies were preserved down here?” she asked. 

“It’s different from the usual way the Knightslayer handled his victims… maybe he was trying things out to determine what his style would be,” I theorized. 

Before our conversation could continue, my phone blew up with a call from our captain and I got chewed out for going behind his back. 

“You’re this close to being suspended,” he snarled. Unfortunately for him, this discovery meant I would need to be front and center so I ignored the smoke he was blowing out his ass and decided to schedule another meeting with Arthur. 

“Can I come along for this? I’m curious to hear what the kid has to say,” Renee told me. 

We made it to the hospital right after lunch rush, neither of us too focused on food given the disturbing things we’d seen. Arthur seemed happy that we had come back. 

“I was right, wasn’t I?” he said, almost grinning from ear to ear. But when he saw our grim expressions, he changed his tune and told us what we needed to know. 


“My dad got divorced when I was young… but he kept that shop until it drove him nearly bankrupt. I told him he was tossing money down the drain… but he said it was all he had left to remember my mom by.”

“Your mother worked there?” Renee guessed. 

“I never actually asked, but I did decide to go ahead and let dad dream a little. He came to me and told me needed help to keep the business afloat so I offered some of my trust fund money to pay the bills and rent, nothing major.” 

“That explains why the power has been on all this time. You are not eighteen yet so that money would still be under your father’s control. He got you to agree to the usual transfer before putting you here… and siphoned the funds ever since,” I said, astounded by the cold and calculated way his father had used him. 

“My mother is the one that told me I should be worried about him. She claimed that he was sending her strange gifts, and that he was stalking her. He said that he would make it so we were all a family again. But it didn’t add up because I also saw him frequently hook up with women…”

“And eventually you realized those same women were disappearing on the city streets,” Renee commented. 

“The butcher shop is just the beginning of his rampage… I want to help more. I want to close this chapter in my life and destroy his legacy,” Arthur told us. 

I told him we got the go ahead from the deputy chief and Arthur said that the next thing we would need to do would be to contact his mother and find out what his dad sent to her. 

“Has she not reached out to you?” Renee asked. 

“I don’t think she’s ready… and I understand that. We grew apart before I came here. I wanted to make things right between me and dad.. and I thought I could. Well, I guess my predicament proves I was wrong about that,” he said with a shrug. 

The doctors announced that Arthur could leave anytime he wanted so we arranged to escort him to his mother’s house the next morning. I was filled with anxiety and excitement, wondering how the wife of this famous serial killer would react when seeing her long lost son. 

She lived nearly twenty three miles out of town, almost on the state border, and didn’t seem keen to sit down with Arthur but relented when she found out we would be present. Was she thinking her son was somehow sympathetic to the psychotic tendencies of her ex-husband? 

When we met, I could tell she was skittish and confused about the visit. 

“You want to see what Bartholomew sent me?” she repeated several times before finally revealing the gifts she had gotten. 

Arthur wasn’t kidding when he declared they were odd. 

Some of the gifts were quite old, like talismans that appeared to be from the Dark Ages. Others were more modern, such as a book on occultism and astral projection. None of them made sense but all of them were disturbing. 

“I didn’t realize they might be connected to the killings until I saw the news. You must believe me that I didn’t know he had such dark desires,” she pleaded. 

“We aren’t here to accuse you of anything but to simply get to the bottom of this,” Renee said as she began to comb the books. 

Her facial expressions became both puzzled and frightened as she saw what was within.  

“Was there anything in the other victims found about black magic and ritualistic killings?” she asked. 

I hesitated to reveal key information in front of the killer’s family but knew that stating it could also lead us one step closer to a resolution. 

“You’ve seen the files as much as me. The reason we called him the Knightslayer is because he used techniques that were common during witch-hunts of the dark ages. We theorized that he was trying to send a message to authorities, but never could pinpoint more than that,” I told her as she showed me the books. There were lots of notes by our killer relating to forbidden magic and spells, little of which made much sense to me and I asked his wife what she thought of the gifts. 

“When I first got them, I thought he was trying to make amends with me. That’s what ex-lovers do, but I didn’t reciprocate and I think that angered him. I never knew he was out there killing women because I didn’t show him the affection he needed… if I had just known…”

She soon became inconsolable and Renee and I realized it might be time to leave them alone. 

“Mom, I think the police could use these items to figure out what dad was truly up to,” Arthur told her. She gladly got rid of all of them. 

On the drive back, Arthur was silent as he read the different tomes. “He went through a lot of effort to procure these. It doesn’t make sense that he was so obsessed with the dark arts and then simply killed himself. What was all of this for?” he muttered. I said nothing, too focused on the fact that this trip felt like a colossal waste of time. We had come no closer to determining where his father took the other victims or what he was trying to accomplish with their corpses. 

“We’ll contact you when we have something else, Arthur. Thanks for all your help,” I told him as we dropped him off at a motel. He looked like a lost confused puppy. 

Renee and I drove down the road toward a bar and once we had a few drinks, she started talking about the kid. 

“Must be awful for him, to be cut off from the world for so long and then suddenly be back in the heat of things. To wake up and realize that everyone has forgotten about you and you don’t even have a way to rebuild? That’s gotta be rough, Ollie,” she said between sips. 

“He is handling it better than I would,” I admitted as I took out the last gift that Arthur’s father had sent, a strange coin that had a picture of a snake eating its own tail. 

“I feel like I have seen this symbol before,” I told her, passing it to my partner. 

Renee took a picture of the coin and pulled up similar images on Google, showing me the results. 

“The Ouroboros, a mythical creature that is said to represent the endless cycle of life and death and rebirth..” 

And below that was a script that looked like it was written in ancient french. 

“With no grave made, a curse upon an heir,” Renee translated. 

“It sounds like more nonsense to me,” I admitted. 

“I feel like we have all the pieces of a puzzle but we aren’t seeing the complete picture,” she said with a sigh. She called it a night and I dropped her off at the parking garage. I went into the precinct and dug out all the notes I’d made on every single case surrounding the Kingslayer. Even though the Captain had taken down my bulletin board, I used my cubicle wall to make a new one, trying to tie together different aspects of the story. 

Haversen killed thirteen women, one every month on a different day that matched their zodiac signs. We had figured that out thanks to the tattoos on their bodies. At first we presumed that the ink was there prior to the killing, but the fourth victim we had found, named Jade; still was fresh enough for us to realize that the killer had marked them with the matching zodiac symbol. 

That would fit into the knights of the round, each one a warrior that protected Camelot and King Arthur. 

It occurred to me that it seemed like every victim was also connected in some way to Haversen’s son. Either a nurse at the hospital, or some sort of connection to their past at a store or apartment. Why was he killing so many people to keep them away from his comatose son?

Then I looked at the grisly pictures of the bodies. Women torn to shreds by crude butcher knives and blades. The killer was smart but his methods were grotesque. 

The first woman had lost her eyes, had them surgically removed before being frozen in that godawful basement. 

The second woman I realized was missing a hand. The left one. 

I followed down the list and soon discovered that each victim was missing a different body part. 

The only thing missing… I paused as I formed a diorama. 

Then I pulled up that picture of Arthur’s mother and put it side by side to this strange Frankenstein creation. 

“Oh my god,” I said as I realized the truth and scrambled to call the captain. No response. 


I went to Renee’s apartment next and despite the hour she agreed to come with me back to Haversen’s ex wife. It was so dark we could hardly see the road in front of us. 

“Ollie, look,” my partner said as we crossed a bridge and neared the motel where we had dropped off Arthur. There was a vehicle in the parking lot that matched the one we had seen at his mother’s house. 

“Why the hell would she be here?” Renee asked. 

We stopped the car and rushed to his motel room but after a few curt knocks we determined that it would be necessary to kick the door down. 

Inside the room was smeared with blood all across the queen size bed. And in the middle of that mess was Arthur’s mother, her head cut clean off. 

“Jesus,” Renee said as she stepped back out to the parking lot. 

I pulled my phone out to call it in, but before I could dial I heard the sound of a scream and turned to see Arthur standing in the doorway with a butcher knife to my partner’s throat. 

“Toss the phone to me, would you, Detective?” Arthur said as he pressed the blade hard enough to make blood trickle down her neck. Renee looked too terrified to fight back. And then I realized why. In Arthur’s right hand he was still holding the decapitated head of his mother. 

“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t fill you with lead, you son of a bitch,” I said, pulling my firearm and pointing it at him. 

“You do that and you’ll never be able to see the full extent of my work,” he said with a crooked smile. 

Renee gave me a look that told me to go along with this and I lowered the gun before saying, “All right, Bartholomew. You’re holding all the cards here. Where are we going?” I asked. 

He pointed toward the car and told me to give him my gun and phone as we got in. 

“Are you hurt?” I asked my partner as we were forced into the trunk of the car. 

“Only my pride is bruised,” she quipped. “Oliver you need to stop smoking, your breath stinks,” she added in the claustrophobic space. The car bumped along and I tried my best to not roll my eyes as I realized she was trying to be funny to relieve tension. 

“Where is he taking us?” she whispered. 

“Probably to wherever he has been keeping the other body parts,” I said dryly. 

“Just a second ago, you called that kid by his dad’s name. What was that about?” Renee asked. 

Before I could answer the trunk popped open and we had a gun in our face again. 

“We’re here,” he announced. We were led out of the car and into a warehouse. “This is close to the docks…” I realized as he closed the door to the warehouse and locked it shut. 

“The smell of raw fish kept anyone from noticing my work,” he muttered as he plopped the head down on a slab and then started up a generator. On the wall I saw all of the body parts from the other women, including the recent ones we had found from the freezers. 

“You broke into police evidence? I’m impressed,” I told him. 

“You must have forgotten that your captain brought me over to question me about the factory. After that boring inquiry it didn’t take much to recover what I needed. Nobody was paying attention to me anyway since the news was buzzing about the discovery of the corpses,” he commented as he pointed toward the sewed together bodies that he had amalgamated. 

“So what do you think, Detective? Is this a fitting vessel for my future bride?” he asked. 

“Listen Haversen I know you used black magic or whatever to connect to your son, but whatever spell you think will work on this corpse… it’s going to end badly,” I warned him. Renee’s jaw dropped. 

“Holy shit. So you ARE Bartholomew?” she asked. 

“If you idiots had actually taken the time to read Arthur’s medical records you would have realized the hospital declared him brain dead almost a year ago. Just the way I planned it,” the young man standing in front of us proclaimed. 

“Except now you’ll have to kill both of us if you want to make it out of here alive. And the police will be hot on your tail when they find your wife’s body mutilated in that motel. Sorry Haversen but this game is almost over for you,” I told him, refusing to be seen as a fool by this serial killer. 

Bartholomew seemed lost in thought for a long moment before raising the gun and firing point blank at Renee. Before I could even react, my partner was dead on the warehouse floor from a bullet to the skull. 

“Now all I need to do is repeat the transfer spell and take over your body, Detective Cotes. Then me and my bride can play house wherever we want with no one to interfere,” he laughed. 

My blood was boiling. I balled up my fists and lost myself in a fit of rage. But instead of hurtling myself at the young body Bartholomew was using, I grabbed the severed head of his wife. 

Rushing across the warehouse floor, I tossed it out the window just as Haversen shot me in the leg. 

“You bastard,” he snarled as he realized his prize was gone. 

He pointed the gun at my face and taunted me. “But you must realize by now that even death is just a setback for someone like me. I’m immortal now, Detective as long as I can move from body to body. And you’re just a stepping stone toward that eternity.” 

He hadn’t noticed that I had grabbed Renee’s badge from her body and before he could pull the trigger again I tossed it in his face, temporarily blinding him. 

In that instant my hands were against his throat and I was tackling him to the ground. The gun slid away and we were wrestling. I fought with every bit of strength I had left. The young body he used was relentless, and he grabbed a butcher knife to try and finish the job. 

I stopped the blade with my bare hands and then slammed my head against his face. 

Bartholomew fell against the butcher slab and I thrust the blade into his chest, pinning him down. 

“You think you’re a god now? Some kind of resurrected messiah?” I said as I pushed my weak body over to turn on the contraption. The conveyor belt sprung to life and dragged him toward the spinning blade. 

As his screams filled the warehouse and blood splattered across the scene, I spit on his sorry shoes. “You were never even close to being trash,” I shouted. 

When it was all said and done, nothing was left of him except those same shoes, mangled by the blade and filled with bits of his flesh and muscle. 

I found the cell phone and called Deputy Chief Romero to the docks. 

As they cleaned up the crime scene and offered Renee’s badge to me, I felt sadness hit my very soul. 

“Who would have thought that his comatose son would want to finish his legacy?” My captain asked. 

I didn’t bother going into all the strange mysticism involved in the case. Bartholomew had done a good job of fooling all of us when he became Arthur just to find his wife again. 

I watched as they took away the bodies of the victims, or what was left of them, my mind troubled by what this mad man had attempted to do. 

He loved her so much he wanted to have her forever and he thought this ritual would do that. Recreating a perfect body he thought that he could have all to himself. 

I realized as I said my goodbyes to Renee in some ways I understood his dark obsession. Love is stronger than death, and it can be the one force that makes us do terrible things, I thought. 

But love can also free us, and make us do what’s right. Like when the real Arthur tried to stop his father a year ago. 

I know Arthur and Renee will rest in peace for their good deeds. 

And I’m confident there’s a special place in hell for killers like Bartholomew Haversen.
