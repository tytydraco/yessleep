The night air had cooled but kept its weight, damp with a dew that hadn’t decided to fall. The hills were a smear of graphite and smoke. Somewhere far off, an owl questioned the dark and got no answer. We crossed the yard in a low jog with the grass hushing against our shins.

Nick moved tight to my shoulder. “You really think—”

“Listen,” I whispered.

We both froze.

On the wind: a rhythm too steady to be wind, not quite music, but voices stacked in a low, repeating shape, more breath than tone. Lantern light bobbed faintly at the treeline, disappearing, reappearing, like the woods were swallowing it and spitting it back out.

Nick’s mouth flattened. He didn’t argue again.

We slipped through the fence where a slat had bowed, then into the trees. The world changed there—colder by degrees, the dark more complete, the smells different: moss and iron and something mineral, like the riverbed of a creek that hadn’t seen daylight in a century. The ground turned spongy and then firm, then spongy again, as if the path had a pulse.

We moved by habit and guesswork, following the lanterns when they showed themselves and the sound when they didn’t. The chant thickened. It felt like we were walking toward the stomach of a storm.

The trees gave way all at once.

A well sat dead center of a clearing, the well older than the clearing itself: stones black with age and damp, the mortar between them veined white like scar tissue. A timber apparatus rose over it in an X, heavy axles lashed with iron bands, rope coiled around a spindle slick with years of use. Hooks hung idle, a few with loops of rope already tied.

Lanterns circled the space at measured intervals, light low and amber. Shadows leaned and straightened in slow time.

The family stood in a crescent around the well.

Mae, her shawl pinned neat, hands folded like prayer. Ruth, sleeves rolled, the bones of her wrists fine as twigs. Silas and Jonah shoulder to shoulder, their faces smeared with something dark, their mouths working the chant. Abel near the front, not leading and not following, head bowed like the woods were a place for resting.

In front of them, on a narrow platform that jutted from the side of the well, stood a man that looked ancient and familiar.

Tall and thin to the point of absence, but steady, like a post that had outlasted the fence. His shoulders tilted with age but didn’t fold. The skin along his jaw was fine as paper, and the veins at his temples made a faint blue map that the lantern light redrew with every flicker. When he lifted his head, the whites of his eyes didn’t catch: the irises were so dark they read as pits, deep and still, the color of wet earth at midnight.

There was nothing theatrical in him. He stood like someone who had been standing for a very long time, and would continue to, no matter what the body said.

Only after I’d finished counting the facts of him did something click: the fixed silhouette at the treeline, the watcher on the stairs at dinner, the painted hand on Clara’s shoulder in the portrait. All of them were the same man. And that man was here.

Nick’s fingers found my sleeve, not a pull, just a point of contact. *Don’t run. Don’t speak. Just see.*

The chant slackened. The old man raised a hand and the air seemed to lean toward it.

Silas stepped forward from the line, carrying something in both arms. Clara walked beside him, bare feet black with soil, her hair plaited close to her skull. The thing Silas held was not quite a garment in the way clothes are garments: it was a shape of stitched-together skins, some fur, some feathered, some hairless and pale. You could see the seams where Clara’s small, precise stitches had pulled unlike textures into agreement. Antlers were lashed to a crown of leather, wide and complicated, velvet hide rubbed away in places to reveal raw bone.

They stopped before the old man.

Clara lifted the headpiece as if lifting a sleeping child.

The ancient man bent a fraction. Silas steadied the antlers from behind as Clara lowered the weight onto the old man’s skull. For a breath it looked ludicrous, theatrical. Then the antlers settled, and it wasn’t a costume anymore. The shapes of animal had made a place to live on a human body. The hair along my arms rose as if to listen.

Clara took the cloak from Silas and shook it once, gently. Something wet flicked from the seams. She drew it around the old man’s shoulders, fastening it with a bone toggle at his throat. Her hands lingered a second longer than the gesture required. When she stepped back, her face was calm and empty.

Mae stepped forward with an object I hadn’t seen at first: a drinking horn carved from something too old to be bone, yellowed and porous, etched with grooves that seemed to travel deeper than the surface. She held it in both hands like an offering.

The old man took it and lowered it toward the mouth of the well.

The sound changed. It wasn’t chant anymore: it was the breath the woods had been holding, pulled in and held again. The rope at the spindle trembled. Water moved somewhere far below, not a splash but a large body rearranging itself.

When he raised the horn, it was full of a liquid that wasn’t water by any law I knew. Black, but not like ink—black like the absence of light, like the underside of a rock. It carried no scent and every scent at once: cold metal, creek bed, storm.

He spoke, and the voice that came was his and not his, thin and deep at the same time, like two notes held together.

“From the water we are kept,” he said. “To the water we are bound.”

He drank.

It ran down his chin like oil, leaving no shine. When he lowered the horn, his eyes filled as if from within, pooling with the same black, and then the black overflowed. It didn’t streak; it gathered and fell, thick, bead by bead, onto the stones at his feet, where it vanished as if the ground had been waiting to swallow it.

The woods answered.

Not with wind first, but with vibration, as if the roots under our boots had become a single instrument and someone had drawn a bow across them. Then wind came, and with it the far-off roar of water that wasn’t there, that couldn’t be there: river, surf, flood, all of it at once. The lantern flames went thin and blue, then snapped back fat and orange.

I couldn’t tell if my eyes were open or closed. The noise was inside my skull, a pressure, a pulse, the same one that had rolled over the fields last night and made strangers out of our own bodies, only now it had teeth.

Nick’s fingers tightened at my sleeve. I held still.

The old man lifted one hand, palm forward, and the world stopped.

Silence hit so clean my ears rang.

He turned. His head moved slowly under the weight of antler and stitched hide. He extended a single finger—long, knotted, nail yellow and sharp—and pointed across the crescent of family without looking to see where the finger would land.

It landed on Clara.

She didn’t flinch.

There was no collective gasp, no pleading. Only a subtle shift in the Stillwaters’ bodies, the way people stand differently in church when the hymn changes. Acceptance clicked into place around the circle.

Until Harlan made a sound like a large animal being shot.

He moved before the echo faded. Surging forward, the ground seemed to buckle under his weight. Silas stepped in and caught a shoulder; Harlan shook him off like he was made of straw. Jonah wrapped both arms around his waist from behind, boots digging into the dirt, teeth bared with the effort. Harlan dragged them both a full step, then another, then another. A furnace of a man built only for forward.

Then, for the first time, I heard his voice: torn open and raw.

“No—please. Not my daughter.”

Ruth was there in a blink, hands on his forearm, trying to turn the momentum sideways. He bellowed—a wild, broken sound—and kept going, a living plow.

“Please, please, please,” he begged, the words collapsing into themselves. “Not her. Take—take me.”

They almost had him stopped. They didn’t.

He heaved once more, dragging the three of them inches closer to Clara’s still form before she moved.

Clara lifted a hand and looked at him with pure love and calm. Her palm faced him, her smile soft—a gesture that said *enough*.

“Don’t worry, big guy,” she said, her voice clear enough that it felt like she’d spoken inside my mouth. “I can handle it.”

Harlan’s body remembered to obey her before his mind did. He stopped so fast he staggered. The fight poured out of him like water from a torn bag. Ruth and Jonah held his arms because there was nothing left in them to hold. He trembled inside his own skin.

He dropped to his knees and bent his head like the ground had pulled it down by a string. When he spoke, it came up through him raw.

“All this time, did you know?” he said. “They made me promise. Said you had to be Stillwater through and through.” His voice broke on the name. “I’m sorry, Clara. I’m so—so sorry.”

She smiled: small, private, for him and for no one else. Then she lifted her chin to the antlered old man as if reminding him of the next step.

Silas moved first, not looking at Harlan as he passed. He reached for a rope and pulled down a loop, quick and practiced. Jonah came to the other side, the two men a mirrored pair now, and in three movements that must have been rehearsed since before they were born, they had the loop around Clara’s ankles and the rope running over the spindle.

She didn’t resist. She held the hem of her dress for them so it wouldn’t tangle. When they pulled, she let herself be turned upside down. Her hair loosened from its braids and fell toward the well mouth like a black hole sucking her in.

The old man drew a blade from the folds of his cloak.

It was not a sickle and not a sword. The hilt was wrapped in dark hide, the guard a narrow crescent. The blade itself curved in a clean arc, a new moon hammered into steel. Its edge didn’t shine; it absorbed the lantern light and gave nothing back.

The sound the woods made then wasn’t wind, wasn’t water. It was a crowd inhaling together in a stadium you couldn’t see.

I felt Nick’s breath go ragged.

“Alex,” he said, not above a whisper. “We’re leaving. Now.”

I couldn’t answer. Not until the blade had a place to go.

He stepped under the X-beam, the antlers brushing the wood, and positioned himself with the careful geometry of someone who had done this many times and would do it many more. He touched the back of the blade to Clara’s forehead, a benediction, then set the edge against her skin above the pelvis and drew it downward in a single, horribly clean motion, as if he were opening a seam that had always been there.

The black water roared though there was no water, and the lantern light fluttered like a flock of trapped birds. Clara made a sound that was not pain and not relief, but something both older and simpler. The sound of death.

The rope creaked. Her insides spilled like bags of hot mud. The well took what it was owed.

The antlered head turned, listening to the hush that followed.

When he spoke again, his words were old and easy in the mouth, practiced until the ritual itself seemed to speak through him:

“Blood mends what time unthreads. Flesh feeds what water keeps. The root is watered, the branch preserved, the name made whole.”

He lifted the blade, black tears still ticking to stone. “So is the circle kept. So is the debt repaid.”

His gaze—those bottomless black eyes—swept the clearing, then beyond it, as if he could see the cabin through the trees. The voice gentled and curdled at once.

“Now,” he said, almost tenderly, “bring the sleepers below. The wombs must be watered. Let the regrowth begin.”

Nick’s hand closed around my wrist. This time he pulled.

I moved.

We ran.

The first steps were syrup—grass, mud, air, all too thick—but then the clearing spat us out and the path found our feet. Branches struck my face and left cold lines. The chant behind us didn’t follow—it deepened. It felt like the woods were chanting now, the family only a mouth they used.

When the trees thinned, the farm opened under the moon, the main house dark at the windows. The cabin sat where we left it, close and small and suddenly so far away.

Somewhere behind us a voice called one word: not our names, not a command. A word like a bell.

Nick flinched. “They heard us.”

“Run,” I said, though we were already running, though I could feel my lungs sanding themselves smooth from the inside.

We took the fence in a clatter of wood and knees. The yard met us like a shallow sea, all resistance and drag.

The farm was awake now. 

And it wanted something from us.

\*\*\*

We burst through the trees like we’d been spit out of them, breath coming in shallow, broken pieces.

The cabin lights were still off. The windows held nothing but our reflections.

Hailey was the first to reach the door. She yanked it open before we’d even hit the steps.

“What happened?” she asked. “Where the hell were you?”

“We followed them,” I said. “It wasn’t some ceremony—it was a ritual. The old man, the one from the portrait, he drank something from the well. Then they hung Clara.”

“What old man?” “What do you mean hung her?” Hailey and El spoke at once, voices jagged with panic.

Nick’s face had gone gray. “They killed her. Like it was—normal. Strung her up like some fucking pig and gutted her.”

Hailey’s hand flew to her mouth. “Jesus Christ…”

“We have to go,” I said. “Right now.”

El shook her head, still half-lost. “We can’t just—where are we even going?”

I grabbed her shoulders, voice soft but shaking. “Baby, I know. I’ll explain everything later. But please, just trust me. We need to get the fuck out of here now.”

She hesitated, then nodded. That was enough.

We moved fast: jackets, shoes, whatever we could grab. The lamp stayed off. The house across the yard was dark, too dark. Every step sounded like a gunshot.

Outside, the cold bit through my clothes. The air smelled of wet iron and pine sap. We sprinted toward the truck, the gravel sucking at our boots.

Nick slid into the driver’s seat and turned the key.

*Click.*

Turned it again.

*Click click.*

“Come on, come on,” he hissed.

He jumped out and popped the hood, his keychain flashlight jerking. The beam bounced across the engine.

“The fuse is gone,” he said, voice flat. “The fucking starter fuse is gone.” He slammed his fist into the hood.

“We were never meant to leave,” I said.

From the woods, a light flickered once, then again, joined by others. Lanterns, moving in slow, easy rhythm.

Hailey whispered, “Then we run.”

No one argued.

We took off across the field. The grass whipped our legs. The sky had gone black and low—a storm without sound. Behind us came a pulse: steady, deep, alive.

The chant.

El stumbled; I caught her wrist before she hit the ground.

“Keep moving!”

“Where?” she gasped.

I didn’t have an answer.

Nick and Hailey were just ahead, cutting through the dark. The field gave way to trees, trunks rising like pillars. The air grew thick, humid, wrong. My heartbeat filled the void.

Somewhere behind us, branches snapped—not the thin crack of twigs, but whole limbs giving way.

The chant dropped out.

A new sound replaced it: a deep, animal bellow that shuddered through my ribs.

We were still running when Hailey tripped.

She went down hard, face-first into the dirt. Nick didn’t see—he kept running.

I turned back, grabbed her by the arm, hauled her up. “Got your back, Hails.”

She managed a breathless laugh, wiped dirt and blood from her chin. “Thanks.”

Then the forest moved.

The smell hit first: rot and copper.

The trees ahead of us parted without wind. Something enormous pushed through, dragging the dark with it.

The stag.

It stepped from the trees like something older than the forest itself: a body built from centuries instead of flesh. Its antlers stretched wider than its own shadow, impossibly tangled, layered like roots fighting for light, each tip tapering into a blade-sharp point. Moss hung from the tines in long, wet streamers.

Its breath steamed through the night, thick with rot and iron. Where the fur split, veins pulsed beneath the hide like roots full of black sap. Its eyes were pits of Stillwater—deep, patient, and unblinking—and when they found us, the forest bowed.

El froze.

“Run,” I said.

We turned. The sound behind us was thunder in slow motion. The ground trembled.

The stag lunged, and the forest seemed to move with it.

I pulled El sideways between two trees as it charged.

Hailey was just a step behind us when it hit her.

The rack of antlers struck like a collapsing canopy—not one wound, but a hundred. Spears of bone punched through her torso, her arm, her thigh, lifting her off the ground in a jerking arc. The sound was wet and muffled, like a boot pulled from mud.

For a heartbeat she hung there, impaled in a dozen places, her body trembling against the weight of the creature. Pinned there like an offering on a tree of bone; her blood spilled down the tines in long threads, glinting black in the faint moonlight.

Then the stag shook its head, violent and final, and she came apart.

She hit the ground in pieces of motion: a knee, a shoulder, a head. The air filled with the copper smell of her, the soil drank deep. One hand twitched once, then folded open, reaching for nothing.

Nick’s scream tore through the clearing.

He was beside her before I even registered he’d moved, hands clawing at her shoulders, her face, the holes that leaked steaming blood.

“No, no—come on, baby, please—wake up—”

His voice cracked, kept going. “You’re fine, you’re fine, you’re—”

He broke.

I dropped to my knees beside him, my voice shaking. “Nick. We have to go.”

“She’s breathing,” he said, delirious. “She’s—she has to be—”

“Nick,” I said again, louder this time.

He shook his head, voice unraveling. “No, no, no—please, Hails, I’m so sorry. Please.”

He trembled, stroking her hair, not sparing me even a glance.

El stood a few feet away, shaking so hard I could hear the fabric of her jacket rasping.

Behind us, light began to filter through the trees—lanterns again, many of them, moving slow and steady, a warm glow that looked like mercy until you remembered where you were.

A voice called out, calm and almost kind. Mae. 

“Come now.”

I turned toward the sound.

Something heavy hit the side of my head. The world split open: bright, then black, then nothing.
