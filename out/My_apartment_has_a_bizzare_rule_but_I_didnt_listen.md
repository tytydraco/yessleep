I moved into Rosehill Apartments three weeks ago. Rent was cheap. Too cheap for downtown. The kind of price where you don’t ask questions—you just sign and pray the plumbing works.

Mr. Harmon, the landlord, was a gaunt, paper-dry man. Moved like he’d been alive longer than the building. He handed me an actual **typed** rulesheet. Not printed. Typed. Yellowed paper. Smelled like old pennies.

Most of it was standard:

\* No noise after 10 PM.
\* Take trash to chute.
\* Laundry room closes at 9.
\* No candles or incense (fire hazard).

But then, halfway down the list, bolded and underlined:

“DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE DOOR TO APARTMENT 6E FOR MORE THAN 9 SECONDS.”

Not a joke. Not explained. Just there. Like the most normal thing in the world.

I raised an eyebrow.

Mr. Harmon said nothing for a long beat. Then, without blinking:

> “We’ve never had to evict a tenant. Just… follow the rule.”

---

At first, I didn’t even notice 6E. My apartment was on 6C, same floor, a few doors down. I passed 6E without thinking about it.

Until one night, I was walking home late. My earbuds were in, playing a podcast. I took the stairs, half-asleep, turned the corner—

And 6E was right in front of me.

Wooden door, brass number slightly crooked. Old, cracked peephole. Paint bubbling slightly like something beneath it was trying to push out.

I remembered the rule.

And I stared at it.

\*\*I counted.\*\*
Just to mess with it.
Just to prove how dumb it all was.

\*\*1.\*\*
Nothing.
\*\*2.\*\*
Faint scratching. Probably rats.
\*\*3.\*\*
The peephole… twitched.
\*\*4.\*\*
A whisper? No—my podcast. Right?
\*\*5.\*\*
The brass number \*rattled\*.
\*\*6.\*\*
Pressure built in my ears like altitude sickness.
\*\*7.\*\*
The doorknob shifted. Not turned. \*Shifted\*, like something inside was moving its hand slowly.
\*\*8.\*\*
A voice from behind the door said:

> \*“Almost...”\*
> \*\*9.\*\*
> The peephole blinked.

\*\*Not flickered. Blinked.\*\*

Moist. Human. Vertical.

I turned and ran so fast I dropped my keys.

---

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept picturing the door. That eye. That voice. I even checked to see if I’d had a fever dream. I hadn’t.

The next morning, I spoke to the lady in 5F—June, maybe 70s, chain-smokes and watches Wheel of Fortune with subtitles.

When I said “6E,” her hand \*\*froze mid-cigarette.\*\*

She stared at me for a second and then said:

> “You \*looked\*, didn’t you?”

I nodded. Jokingly. She didn’t laugh.

She opened a cupboard and handed me a \*\*mason jar\*\* with salt and \*\*two dead bees\*\* inside. No explanation.

> “Set this outside your door before dusk. Not inside. Not in the hallway. \*\*Outside.\*\* And if you hear knocking tonight—no matter \*who it sounds like\*—\*\*don’t open it.\*\*”

I wanted to ask more, but she just closed her door.

---

That night, I placed the jar outside like she said.

At \*\*3:16 AM\*\*, I woke to the \*\*softest, most deliberate knocking\*\* I’ve ever heard.

\*Knock…\*
\*Knock…\*
\*Knock…\*

Then I heard a voice behind my door.

It was my voice.

> “Hey… it’s me. I left my wallet out there. Just open the door, I’ll grab it and go.”

I didn’t move.

> “Come on. I saw you look. That means I’m \*\*free\*\* now.”

The voice got… thicker. Wet. Like it had mucus dripping between syllables.

> “It’s cold out here. Don’t be rude to your guest. You \*invited me.\*”

I curled up in bed, heart sprinting, whispering "no" over and over.

It laughed.

\*\*My laugh.\*\*

Only wrong. Higher. Like it was being puppeted.

When morning came, I opened the door.

The \*\*jar was smashed.\*\*

The bees were gone.

---

Since then, I’ve heard knocking every night. Always at 3:16 AM. Always 3 knocks. Always me, or \*my mom’s voice\*, or \*my best friend’s laugh\*. They say things I’ve never told anyone.

Last night, it whispered:

> “You can’t hide in 5F forever.”

I never told it I went there.

---

I asked Mr. Harmon today what 6E \*is\*. What happens when you break the rule.

He didn’t blink.

> “6E’s been empty since 1993. No one’s ever moved out.”

Then he handed me a second page of the lease.

Typed.

At the bottom:

> \*\*“If you stare too long, it sees you. If it sees you, it learns you. If it learns you, it \*tries to become you.\*”\*\*

---

Tonight is night nine.

The knocking hasn’t stopped.

It no longer waits for 3:16.
It no longer uses just my voice.
Last night, it used \*\*my scream\*\*.

The scream I made \*\*the first night\*\* I looked.

I’m not the first.

And if I ever open that door, even an inch...

I won’t be the last.

---

\*\*If you ever move into a place with weird rules... follow them.\*\*

Because some doors aren’t meant to keep things \*in\*.

They're meant to keep things \*\*out\*\*—of \*you\*.
