I was fourteen, and I was clearly depressed. I mean, it’s not like I knew it at the time I just thought I was sad about everything that had happened. But looking back…

We had just moved into a new house, and now it was just Mom and me. She kept telling me it was for the best, a fresh start. But it wasn’t that simple. Maybe for her it was, but not for me. I don’t blame her. I know she did what she could. Honestly, if one day I have a daughter and end up in the same situation… I wouldn’t know what the hell to do either.

There was still a whole month before school started, and I wished with all my being that it would pass as slowly as possible. I didn’t want to face it. New school, new classmates, new dramas. My wish was coming true because another thing that changed was that I no longer had internet access. Mom didn’t either, there was no service at the house. I spent my time watching DVDs, locked in my room.

It was a very small town. Everyone knew everyone, and I want to believe they didn’t realize that we noticed their judgmental looks every time we went shopping. Or at least I did. I think Mom noticed too, but she tried to ignore it, acting like they weren’t there. I knew that twisted smile, that slight shake of the head when they looked at me, she was extremely uncomfortable too.

That fed into my nightmares. Eyes staring at me, but in the dark. Whispers saying horrible things about me while I stood under the spotlight, doing that challenge one more time. I’d wake up gasping for air. I couldn’t get enough oxygen. Every night I thought the same thing: this would be my last moment alive. I was convinced I wouldn’t wake up. Eventually, I started fantasizing about it, wishing it.

Mom didn’t know any of this, had no way of knowing. And maybe it was better that way. No one else could understand me, no one else could get me out of that situation.

The situation kept getting worse. I spent long hours alone in the house while Mom worked. And I started reliving that moment, that fateful day, but now fully awake. They were like intrusive images, I didn’t want to remember them. Yet… there they were.

Supposedly, if we did it, we would be able to communicate with a spirit. It was supposed to be a small cut, and Nick had found his dad’s old razor a few days ago, something he hadn’t told anyone. I went first because he was really scared, his hands wouldn’t stop shaking. It barely burned, only a few drops fell on the paper, and it started to heal right away.

Then it was Nick’s turn. I thought it would be funny since he was already super scared, maybe it would calm him down. Take the seriousness out of what we were doing, which was just a stupid internet challenge. So when he was about to do it, I yelled, “WATCH OUT!”

I immediately realized how serious it was. I saw the blood flowing non-stop… Nick grabbed it and pressed hard. We were both in shock, not knowing how to react.

This played over and over in my mind, spending hours alone in the new house, with some movie in the background. The only thing that could break those memories and images was the sound of Mom’s keys. She was back, everything would be fine. Or at least I felt that way for a little while. A brief relief, because the images would return.

I don’t understand how Mom managed to rebuild her life like that. It was like she had completely forgotten the whole thing. She trusted that it was done, that it was in the past, that it was buried. I’d hear her snoring at night. Sleeping peacefully, calm. Not like me.

Even today I still think someone’s going to kick the door down, handcuff me. That they’ll take me to the yard of the house I grew up in, or the one I lived in until I was fourteen. The one where we did that stupid challenge with Nick. And that subfloor won’t be there anymore, the mud and dirt removed, and they’ll force me to see it… there, wrapped in the sheets from my bed. The ones Mom used to cover him.

It never happened. And I don’t think that day will ever come. But I still have the nightmares, where it all happens over and over. And just before waking up, while Mom is throwing dirt over him, I see Nick’s finger move under the sheet. And again, I stay silent.
