The river fog came in early that Saturday night, rolling off the Blackwater like smoke from a fresh wound.  It slicked over the cracked sidewalks and leaned against the dead windows of the old factory district, blurring the streetlights into pale coins.  By nine o’clock the town felt underwater, every sound muted except the occasional hiss of a passing car and the distant horn of a freight train that never seemed to get any closer

I stood in the middle of Harrow Street with my hands stuffed into my hoodie, listening to my friends’ shoes crunch on broken glass behind me.  We’d been drinking cheap beer at Nico’s place, watching horror movies with the volume cranked up, when Jonah told us the story.  The Candle Man. The name stuck in my head like a splinter and just kept digging.

“Last chance to bail” I said without turning around.

Casey snorted beside me. “You say that like we’re gonna let you go into the death factory alone.”

Nico, shorter than the rest of us and swallowed by his denim jacket, jogged up until he was in step on my other side. “Also, you still owe me for the beer. If you die, your mom’s not paying me back.”

Mara walked a few steps behind, the only one smart enough to bring a flashlight. The beam cut through the fog in a dull cone, sliding over boarded windows and rusted doors. She hadn’t said much since we left, but I could feel her eyes on my back every time I slowed down.

“You sure it’s this way?” she asked.

“Old Harrow Foundry?” Nico said. “Yeah. Just keep going toward the smell of tetanus and disappointment.”

I forced a laugh. The foundry—what was left of it—had sat at the edge of town for over a century, a brick skeleton sinking into the riverbank where kids went to spray-paint their names and scare each other with dares.  But tonight it felt less like a hangout and more like a destination.

Jonah had been wiping his hands on a rag in his dad’s garage when he told us, the air thick with oil and dust.  A guy from his brother’s crew had gone up to the foundry one night last year. He came back without his little sister. Told the cops she ran off. But when he got drunk, the story changed: a tall figure in the fog, a candle burning in its skull, a scream like a blown-out speaker, and then she was just gone.

“Urban legend,” Nico had said.

But Jonah hadn’t argued. He’d just gone quiet in that way that made the hairs on my arms stand up. That silence is what made me say, “What if we just go see?”

Now, slogging through the fog, I wished I’d kept my mouth shut.

We turned off Harrow Street onto the narrow road that dropped toward the river. The asphalt was chewed up and patched so many times it looked scabbed. On the right, chain-link fencing sagged under dead vines; on the left, the ground fell away to the black water below, the river barely visible where Mara’s light skimmed its skin.

“God, it’s like Silent Hill,” Casey muttered. “Minus the budget.”

“Hey,” Nico said, “we had exactly enough budget for a twelve-pack and two bags of chips. Show some respect.”

I didn’t answer. A shape was rising out of the fog ahead—wide and low and broken at the top. What was left of the Harrow Foundry.

Up close, it looked worse than I remembered. The roof was mostly gone, leaving only rusted beams and jagged stretches of wall. The main entrance was choked with rubble. Half-buried in the debris was a metal sign that read HARROW TAL—RY, the missing letters like teeth knocked out of a grin.  Empty windows stared blackly, edged with broken glass. Across one wall someone had spray-painted NO GOD HERE in dripping letters.

“Cheery,” Casey said.

Mara’s beam crossed a bent chain-link gate. A plastic warning sign, once bright, was faded almost white: DANGER. KEEP OUT.

“So naturally,” Nico said, “we go in.”

We squeezed past the edge of the gate. Inside the yard, the gravel was uneven, puddles of black water reflecting distant streetlights. The air smelled like wet rust and something sour underneath, as if a century of smoke and fat had soaked into the ground and never left.

“Okay,” I said, trying to sound casual. “We hit the main floor, snap a few pics, then bounce. Post ‘em. Laugh at Jonah for being dramatic.”

“And if we see him?” Casey asked.

“See who?” Nico said.

Casey rolled his eyes. “The Candle Dude. Mister Wax Skull.”

My throat felt dry. “Then we finally get you the TikTok fame you’ve been begging for.”

Mara stopped walking. Her light had landed on a narrow stairwell that sank into the building’s side. The concrete steps were cracked, the banister rusted into lacy holes. Above the stairwell, someone had painted a crude candle, yellow drips running down its sides, a red pool at the base.

“Basement,” she said.

“Hard pass,” Nico said immediately.

“Basement,” I repeated. “The story said he came from below. From the vats.”

Casey stared at me. “That story also said ‘never go looking for him,’ genius.”

Maybe it was the beer. Maybe it was the fog. Maybe it was Jonah’s face when he mentioned his brother’s friend—the way his expression went slack, like something inside him was sinking.  Whatever it was, I felt pulled.

“We go down,” I said. “Real quick. Just to say we did.”

Mara looked like she wanted to argue, then just shook her head. “I’m not staying up here alone.”

Nico muttered something about bad decisions and early funerals, but he followed as I started down.

The steps groaned under our weight and shed little flakes of concrete with every footfall. The fog thinned as we descended, replaced by a wet chill that seeped through my shoes and into my bones. Mara’s light, strong up top, seemed to shrink and weaken, swallowed by the dark like a match.

“I hate this,” Nico whispered behind me.

At the bottom, the stairs opened into a wide room. The ceiling was low and crisscrossed with rusted pipes; from them hung thick drips of old wax turned gray with age.  The floor was a patchwork of cracked concrete and open pits filled with shadow. Against one wall loomed massive vats, their rims crusted with hardened, pale layers.

“Okay, that’s…gross,” Casey said. “Is that…?”

“Old tallow,” Mara answered quietly. “Rendered fat. They used to make candles from animal fat, sometimes even from—”

“Please don’t finish that sentence,” Nico cut in.

I walked toward one of the vats. Mara’s beam slid over the rim, catching an uneven surface of bubbles and drips, and here and there a darker stain that made my stomach twist. I imagined someone falling in, screaming, bones boiling.

I shook the image away.

“All right, we saw the vats,” Nico said, his voice a little too high. “We did the thing. Can we leave before we catch a ghost-borne disease?”

A faint clink froze us. It sounded like glass tapping glass.

Mara snapped the beam in that direction. The room looked empty.

“What was that?” Casey whispered.

“Probably just…something settling,” I said, but my voice sounded thin even to me.

Clink.

Louder this time, followed by a soft, dry rattle that sounded like teeth chattering.

The light caught a piece of chain swinging slowly from a beam near the far wall, as if someone had just brushed past it.

Mara’s hand shook. “That wasn’t the wind. There is no wind down here.”

Nico took a step toward the stairs. “Okay, nope. I’m out. We saw the vats. We heard the haunted chain. Ten out of ten, leaving now.”

The air felt tight in my lungs. The room was holding its breath.

“We came for proof,” I said. “A picture at least. Otherwise Jonah’s just gonna say we were too scared to really look.”

“Jonah isn’t here,” Casey said sharply. “We are. And whatever made that sound is also here.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but a new sound rolled through the dark and turned everything in my body to glass.

It started low, a vibration in my ribs, like somebody had turned on a huge amp in the next room.  Then it shot upward, jagged and brutal, into a screaming feedback shriek that ripped the air apart.  It didn’t sound like a voice; it sounded like a recording of a scream played too loud through a blown-out speaker, chopped into uneven clips and thrown at us all at once.

“Jesus!” Nico yelled, clapping his hands over his ears. Mara dropped the flashlight. It hit the floor and spun, tossing wild slices of light across the room. The vats leapt in and out of view like tall, hunched figures.

“Upstairs!” Casey shouted.

We ran. My foot slipped on the first step and I smashed into the wall with both hands. The flashlight beam whipped wildly, then stopped, pinning itself on something that hadn’t been there a second before.

Something standing in the middle of the room.

“Don’t…move,” Mara whispered.

The screech faded into a hiss of static, like someone slowly turning a volume knob down.  My own heartbeat hammered in my ears.

The figure was tall and narrow, its shoulders hunched. Strings of what looked like wax and tendon hung from its arms and ribs, dripping but never quite hitting the floor.  Its body was stretched thin, the spine a sharp ridge under sagging remnants of clothes fused with hardened drips.

The head was worse.

It was a half-melted skull, bone and wax collapsed together, eye sockets hollow tunnels.  From a crater in the top rose a single pale candle, perfectly straight, its sides ridged with old drips.  The flame burned a sickly yellow-white, too bright for this much darkness, yet it cast only a tight cone of light on the floor. Smoke curled from it, but instead of rising it slid downward, coiling around the thing’s head like a slow, dirty halo.

The Candle Man.

I didn’t want to name it, but my brain did it anyway.

It moved.

It didn’t lumber. It stepped—long, quick, like it was always on the edge of falling and catching itself at the last instant.  Its knees bowed inward, wrong, making each stride look broken yet horribly efficient.  With its first step, it snapped its head down as if staring at its own feet, lowering the candle so its narrow light swept over the floor.

The beam slid over Mara’s dropped flashlight, over Nico’s shoes, over my hand on the wall. Wherever it passed, our shadows misbehaved. They stretched tall and thin, separating from us, headless, each crowned with a tiny flickering candle on the stump of the neck.

“Don’t look at it,” Mara gasped. “Don’t—”

The Candle Man screamed again.

This time the sound felt like it exploded inside my skull. It was that same blown-out feedback, but chopped into rapid bursts, as if someone were flicking a switch on and off, on and off.  The pipes overhead rattled so hard dust rained down like gray snow. My teeth buzzed.

Nico scrambled up the stairs, half climbing, half crawling. Casey grabbed his arm and hauled him higher.

“Move, Evan!” Casey yelled. “Go!”

I tried. My legs were heavy, filled with slow liquid heat like melted wax. The candle’s light swept forward, and my shadow peeled away from my feet again. I watched it stretch along the wall, its head dissolving, a stubby candle burning at the stump.  I could feel something tugging at that flat, wrong shape and, through it, tugging at me.

Mara slammed into my side and grabbed my arm so hard I yelped. The pain was enough. We charged up the stairs.

Nico was almost at the top. Mara was just ahead of me. Casey stayed at my shoulder, breathing hard, muttering, “Nonononono,” under his breath like a prayer.

The candlelight slid over our feet again.

I saw both shadows: mine and Casey’s. Both stretched, both lost their heads.  Mine snapped back to normal with a sick shudder. Casey’s didn’t. It froze in that headless shape, the little candle on its stump burning steady.

The Candle Man screamed. The chopped bursts smashed into the stairwell like physical blows. The rusted railing rattled and then tore away from the wall.  Casey had one hand on it. Suddenly he had nothing.

He pitched backward with a strangled cry.

I grabbed for him, fingers brushing his sleeve, but the scream felt like it shoved him down, like the sound itself had hands.  He tumbled, hit the landing, and slid to a stop at the Candle Man’s feet.

“Casey!” Nico yelled from above, voice breaking.

The Candle Man bowed low, like it was examining a broken toy. The candle dipped close to Casey’s face. In that tight circle of light, I saw his eyes wide and unfocused, his lips moving soundlessly. His shadow lay pinned beneath him, still headless, its little candle flickering.

For one horrible second, the creature just stared, like a man checking a wick.  Then its jaw opened.

Where a tongue should have been there was a roped mass of half-melted wax and pale spikes like tallow teeth.  It lowered that maw to Casey’s chest. The scream that came next wasn’t the Candle Man’s. It was Casey’s—but shredded, chopped, and blown out in an instant, ripped from his throat and fed straight into the creature.

The sound cut off in the middle like someone had hit stop.  Casey’s body jerked once, then went limp. A thin thread of molten wax slid from the Candle Man’s mouth into his, sealing his lips in a pale line.

“We have to go,” Mara said, voice raw. She yanked my arm.

Everything in me wanted to go down instead of up, to drag Casey away from that narrowing cone of light. But the Candle Man was already straightening to its full height, the candle in its skull flaring brighter, as if it had been fed.  Its head angled toward the stairs, the candlelight reaching for us.

I turned and ran. I don’t remember exactly how I got up the rest of the steps. I only remember the slam of them under my shoes, Nico’s ragged sobs somewhere ahead, Mara’s grip bruising my arm. Then we were bursting back into the open fog, leaving Casey’s body in the dark below, lying in a pool of light that didn’t belong to him anymore.

We tore across the yard. Gravel slid under my feet. Behind us, I heard the wet, even slap of the Candle Man’s steps—too fast, too regular, like a metronome someone had set to “panic.”

We squeezed through the gap in the fence. On the road, the streetlights floated in the fog like pale halos, humming softly.

“Car!” Nico gasped. “We need the car!”

We’d parked three blocks up near the corner store. It might as well have been miles.

Casey would’ve made a joke there, I realized, some crack about cardio or haunted Uber rides. The absence hit like a punch.

We ran uphill. My lungs burned. I risked a look back. At first there was only fog, then a thin, searching cone of light near the ground, jittering as it moved.

The Candle Man had reached the road.

It moved faster here, those bowed knees almost touching as it strode uphill, head still bowed so the candle lit each step.  It reminded me of someone who couldn’t walk unless they could see exactly where their feet fell—like the light was a track and it was stuck on it.

It screamed again. The blown-out screech leapt ahead of it, rattling the metal of the lampposts. One of the bulbs flickered, buzzed, and then went out, leaving a black patch in the fog.

“We’re leading it right under the lights!” Nico shouted.

My brain grabbed onto a piece of Jonah’s story. The Candle Man was drawn to candles in windows, to lone flames after midnight—drawn to light, both his and ours.

“If it needs light,” I panted, “we need the opposite.”

“What, a cave?” Nico said.

I skidded to a stop beside a lamppost. At its base, half-hidden by weeds and trash, was a metal service box.

“Evan!” Mara shouted. “What are you doing?”

“Help me open this!”

I dropped to my knees and clawed at the lid. Rust flaked under my nails. Mara jammed the edge of her flashlight between the lid and the box and pried. The metal shrieked. The lid jumped up an inch. I got my fingers under it and wrenched it open.

Inside was a small breaker panel with a row of switches labeled in fading marker: H‑1, H‑2, H‑3. A cheery yellow sticker on the door read CITY PROPERTY – DO NOT TAMPER.

The Candle Man screamed again, closer. The lamppost above us flickered.

“Which one?” Mara said.

“All of them!” Nico yelled.

I grabbed every switch I could reach and slammed them down. Something thunked inside the pole. The light overhead sputtered, dimmed, then went out.

Down the hill, other lamps tied to the same line dropped one by one, darkness blooming along Harrow Street like a spreading stain.

For a second, everything went very quiet.

Then the Candle Man shrieked.

In the sudden near-black, the candle in its skull flared, brightening its little cone— but there were no other lights now.  No streetlights, no glowing windows, just the fog and that single, quivering beam. The darkness beyond its reach looked thicker, almost solid.

It hesitated. The long legs stuttered. Its bowed head turned in small, jerky arcs, the candle describing a twitchy circle of light on the wet pavement, as if it were searching for paths that had been erased.

“It’s confused,” Mara whispered.

“Good,” Nico said. “Let’s confuse it from very far away.”

We should have just run then, but I couldn’t look away. In that moment, the Candle Man didn’t look like a hunter. It looked lost—like someone trapped in a hallway of their own memories with all the doors bricked up.

“It only knows where to go if there’s light to tell it,” Mara said quietly. “Maybe the foundry was the last place it saw, back when everything was fire and lamps and burning fat. Take away the rest and it’s just…stuck.”

Casey’s face flashed behind my eyes. His shadow, pinned and headless. The thin line of wax sealing his mouth.

“Come on,” I said. My throat hurt. “We’re not losing anyone else.”

We slipped away along the darker side of the street, keeping well clear of the candle’s circle. The Candle Man took no notice. Its frantic stride had become a slow, searching shuffle, the bowed knees almost brushing as it traced small loops on the asphalt, caught in some pattern only it understood.

By the time we reached the brighter part of town, the sound of its broken screeches had shrunk to a thin, glitchy whine in the distance.

At the corner, the streetlights hummed steadily. Neon from the corner store painted the wet pavement red and blue. Nico sagged against a parked car, breathing hard.

“I’m never making fun of your superstitions again,” he said.

Casey would have said something sarcastic. The silence where his voice should have been pressed in around us.

Mara leaned against the brick wall, her knuckles still white around the flashlight. “Do we…call someone?” she asked. “Cops? News? A priest?”

“And say what?” Nico said. “‘Hey, there’s a Victorian wax skeleton with a candle in its head stuck on Harrow Street because we flipped the breaker’? They’ll arrest us for messing with the grid.”

I stared back down the hill. The old foundry district was just a dark notch in the town, a place where the fog sat heavier. Somewhere in that patch, a small, pale flame moved in hesitant arcs.

“If people keep going down there with flashlights,” Mara said, following my gaze, “or leaving candles burning in the windows…he’ll find a path again. He’ll always find a path when there’s light to walk.”

I thought of Jonah’s missing girl. Of Casey lying on the concrete while his shadow burned wrong. Of all the kids who came here for kicks with phones and cheap lighters.

“What if we don’t let them?” I said.

Nico frowned. “Don’t let who what?”

“People,” I said. “What if we make sure nobody goes down there at night with a light. At least on nights like this.”

Mara tilted her head. “You want to put up a sign? ‘Don’t feed the cursed candle creature’?”

“Not a sign,” I said. “A story. We tell them what happened. We tell them what he does. We tell them if they bring light, he follows it.”

“Like an extremely traumatized public service announcement,” Nico said.

“Yeah,” I said. “Exactly like that.”

She watched me for a second, then nodded. “Stories stick. People forget facts, but they remember what scares them.”

We walked to Nico’s car in silence. The interior smelled like stale fries and fake pine, and it was the best smell in the world right then.

As he drove, the normal sounds of town slowly came back: TVs behind thin walls, a distant dog, the occasional car. It was like the world had snapped back into place, but there was a crack running through it now, and I knew exactly where.

“Do we…say his name?” Nico asked at one point.

“Whose?” I said, even though I knew.

“Elias Harrow. The guy who owned the place. That’s who he was, right?”

I stared out at the passing lights. “We’re not telling anyone his name,” I said. “We tell them the rules. Where not to go. What not to do. That’s it.”

“Names give things power,” Mara said from the back seat. “Stories give people a chance.”

Eventually, Nico turned onto my street. Here, most of the houses were dark. Porch lights off. A few sagging decorations left over from some long-gone holiday drooped in the damp air.

He parked in front of my place. “So,” he said, “pizza and movies next weekend?”

“There is no next weekend,” Nico added quickly. “I mean, there is, but we’re not going near anything abandoned ever again.”

Mara managed a small smile. “You’ll forget,” she said. “We all will, a little. That’s why stories matter.”

I stepped out and leaned down to the open window. “Hey,” I said. “If you ever see a single candle burning in a window after midnight…blow it out. Even if it’s not your house.”

“Captain Trauma has spoken,” Nico said, but he nodded.

Mara just said, “Goodnight, Evan.”

I watched their taillights fade into the fog, then went inside.

My mom had left a lamp on in the living room. A nice, normal lamp, warm and soft. I stood over it for a long second, my hand hovering above the switch.

I saw Casey again on the landing, his shadow wrong underneath him, the Candle Man bowing low to examine his flame.  I heard that chopped, blown-out scream.

I turned the lamp off.

The dark that filled the room wasn’t the foundry’s darkness. It felt honest. I stood in it until my eyes adjusted, listening. No screech. No rattling chains. No wet footsteps on the street.

Over the next few days, the story spread like they always do. Nico told it once, then had to keep retelling it. He cut out some of the crying and added more running, but he kept the important part: Casey didn’t make it, and it was because they took light where they shouldn’t have.

Some kids laughed. Some didn’t. Enough believed that, on the next foggy weekend, Harrow Street stayed darker than usual. A couple of lamps “broke.” People blamed the wiring, the town budget, anything but us.

Sometimes, late at night, I’d wake up and listen. Now and then, on a really foggy one, I thought I could hear a faint, distorted wail drifting over the river—glitching in and out like a broken broadcast.  It never came closer.

The Candle Man was still out there somewhere near the foundry, head bowed, candle burning, walking whatever paths of light people gave him—or denied him—with every switch, every screen, every careless flame.

I don’t know if we made things better or worse. I only know that stories travel faster than he does, and that every time someone listens—every time a porch light goes off a little earlier, every time a candle gets blown out after midnight—somewhere in that dark patch by the river, he pauses at the edge of his own thin circle of light and can’t quite find the next step.

And for now, that’s enough for me to sleep.
