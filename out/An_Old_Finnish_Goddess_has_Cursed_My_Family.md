Living with Graves’ disease isn’t fun. The tremors before you’ve even had your morning coffee, the stomach pains and queasiness and nausea and diarrhea, the thermogenesis making you constantly need to find the nearest fan because you’re boiling alive. The disrupted menstrual cycles and bulging, bloodshot eyes and worsened anxiety (which I already had long before my stupid thyroid decided to attack itself). I know so many people have it much, much worse than I do, and I’m lucky to live in the era of modern medicine where this condition isn’t a death sentence, but it’s hard.

My boyfriend’s family doesn’t understand why my hand shakes when I serve food on the dining room table. They mock me for how skinny I’ve gotten and call me anorexic behind my back. His horrid sister makes pointed comments about the dark circles under my eyes and how “tired” and “frail” I look. His brother snickers at them. I love food! I love to eat- this damn disease makes me eat more of it, ravenously. It also makes me throw up most mornings. My doctor said that’s an uncommon, but not unheard of, symptom of Graves’. 

I was a healthy girl before this. A curvy size 12 with a big ass that my boyfriend loved, and muscular thighs from hiking. I didn’t ask for an autoimmune disease, but his family acts like I only use it as an excuse to avoid them. 

I mean, I’m not gonna lie…I do want to avoid them. Who wouldn’t want to avoid a pack of snobby rich assholes that peaked during their frat and sorority days? 

Thank God Eric isn’t like them. Eric, my boyfriend, truly has a heart of gold. He’s a special education teacher and fosters kittens. He keeps food and water in his car to give to homeless people. I’m not sure how someone so caring and down to earth could come from a group of vipers like them. 

…

“Halina,” my mom spoke through the phone, and my blood curdled. She sounded like she’d been crying. My mom *never* cries. 

“Mama?” My voice was small- not its usual deep, loud tone. It didn’t feel right to fill up the silence. 

“It’s grandpa.”

My grandfather had been suffering for many years with polymyositis, but it wasn’t terminal. His once-strong muscles had wasted away and were tender to the touch, and he could no longer walk.  Still, by the sound of my mom’s shaking voice…

“Did he fall?” As a pharmacist, I remembered learning how dangerous that was for the elderly. My grandfather was in a wheelchair, but sometimes he tried to stand up by himself to use the restroom…

“No.” My mom wasn’t even whispering- her voice was hoarse, a croak. “No, his heart stopped.”

“Voi herra Jumala…” My grandpa, and my mom, were from Finland. It came naturally to me to express my shock in their language. 

“I know, sweetheart. I know…”

“Mom…I’m so sorry…” My mom had a contentious relationship with my grandpa, but they had gotten so much closer in the past decade or so. He wasn’t all that old, even. “I wish I could have said goodbye.”

“He knows you loved him very much. He had a picture of you in your white coat on his nightstand. Halina…he would want you to be his laulaja.”

My family are from a particular ethnic group within Finland and Russia called Karelians. Traditionally, at Karelian funerals, the laulaja, or singer, leads the funeral procession. A laulaja is almost always a woman related to the dead. She sings, cries, and tears at her hair and clothes to lead the mourning. In Pagan times, this was said to call the soul bird, or sielulintu, out of the dead’s body so that they could pass on. In the Christian and modern eras, it’s a symbolic show of love and reverence for the deceased. Unlike stoic Finns, we Karelians are an emotional people. We make a big, formal ceremony of crying at important life events- especially weddings and funerals. It was both an immense honor and a small burden to be my grandfather’s laulaja. He trusted me to help his soul take flight…and the entire funeral party would watch intently while my cheeks turn blotchy and snot drip out of my nose as I wailed. 

“You have the best voice in the family,” my mother tried to cajole me with praise. “I’m tone deaf, but you sing beautifully.”

“I’ll do it, mom.” I responded softly, gently. “Don’t worry.” 

“Thank you.” She choked up. “I know it’s embarrassing, I know it’s hard…”

“No, no,” I tried to soothe her with my tone, even though I felt like crying from shock at the news. “I love grandpa. I want to do this for him.”

…

My grandpa was immensely proud of his Finnish culture. He lead the Finnish-American cultural society here in Los Angeles, and he founded a Finnish-interest library within it. He had several more books in the same vein in his home- tomes upon tomes of books from Finnish and Fenno-Swedish authors, collections of modern Karelian poetry from both Finns and Russians, and carefully-sourced digests on Finno-Ugric mythology. My grandfather was a comparative literature professor and *adored* the ancient myths. Though he was a devout Lutheran, he always forbade us from talking in the sauna (“You’re angering the löyly!” Löyly is both steam and a spirit, apparently) and always wore a talisman of Perkele, the thunder God, around his neck. 

My grandfather left his library to me. He knew how much I loved the old myths, and how eagerly I questioned him about the Pagan roots of our Karelian traditions. I skimmed over the spines in one of his bookshelves, fingering the splitting paper and collected dust. A burgundy book with the title written in pen along the spine stopped my roving.

“Akki”

Now, my Finnish is nothing fluent, but I know enough to cause some trouble in a Helsinki karaoke bar (and oh, the trouble my sister and I caused…). I plucked the book from the shelf, surprised to notice that the paper stock looked to be sewn into the binding by hand. The cover was a soft, leather-like material, with the penned title scratched into it as well.

I knew that Akki was a Finno-Ugric mother goddess among certain groups in Russia. I think, in the Finnish mythos, she was Perkele’s wife at one point?

I opened the book, and a drawing stunned me. I minored in Russian literature in college (oh, was Grandpa angry…), and so what I saw was not a lithe, neoclassical Finnish goddess, but a horrific Baba Yaga of sorts. Instead of a chicken-legged hut, she seemed to reside on a storm cloud. Her face was gaunt, with her skin wasting on her bony cheeks, and her eyes were bloodshot and flashed with what I can only describe as pure rage. Her teeth were sharp and pointed, and though her thinness was emphasized, she was tearing into raw waterfowl with them, her mouth bloodied by the effort. 

The picture was ridiculous, actually- like something from a caricature. I started to laugh. Her Graves’ disease features were not lost on me. Is this how I looked when I tore into a Chipotle burrito bowl after a workout? 

“Babe!” I called to Eric from the other room, still chuckling. “You’ve gotta see this!”

“The fuck…?”

“Does this remind you of someone?” I smiled cheekily, and he laughed. 

“A little- especially when you tear into a carton of ice cream.”

“Oooh…we should get some of that on the way home. Moose tracks ice cream!”

…

That night, I had a nightmare. Eric’s sister slapped me in it, so I scratched her face. It bled, and I laughed. I woke up short of breath, with sweat drenching my hair, and felt sick to my stomach. 

I was just stressed, and I knew it. Grief always seemed to manifest as anxiety for me. I missed grandpa- that was all. 

But I couldn’t go back to sleep. Eric woke when I did, hearing my gasp, and gave me a hug, but he had already fallen back asleep. Not wanting to toss and turn all night, I wandered into the kitchen for a cold La Croix. It was burning up in my room…

I spotted the Akki book in a box on one of the chairs by my kitchen table. Maybe reading something in Finnish would put me back to sleep? As it turned out, this book contained Finnish poetry. Many of the poems seemed like spells and incantations- words to chant to help the crops grow and the cows fatten up. But the final poem stunned me completely. 

“Akki, vengeful mistress, we offer this song for you. 

Please be sated by this song, that it pleases you-

We seek out your forgiveness! 

The blight on our crops grows.

The turnips are soft and mottled,

They fall apart in the boiling copper pot

And are hardly fit for a porridge.

The streams are empty of salmon and pike.

We have not even a scale to eat,

Not a shining salmon scale.


Oh Akki, please! 

Are you not sated?

Karjala grows hungry and still you feast from our land.

You rob the flesh from our cows,

The fat from our swine,

Our chickens down to the feather.

Please, Akki, have you not had enough?


Akki, we tricked you. 

This is not supplication. 

We are not coming to beg-

How could you think this?

We, the heirs of Väinämöinen,

We know magic too! 

We know how to enchant with song.

Akki, you who is fat from the meat of Karjala,

May you forever waste away!

Even if you eat, may you never be sated! 

May your muscles waste down to the sinew,
And slack.

May your cheeks grow gaunt when they once were plump. 

May you starve, and may your heirs starve! 

May their eyes bulge with rage, just like yours! 

May they inherit your avarice and your hunger and emptiness! 

May they be as sickly as you are powerful! 


We pen this to you, Akki, shamaness-

Fearsome noaidi of Räkkylä, Pohjois-Karjala. 

May your every last heir remember this song!

Akki Teemuntyttär Kettunen, may you rot, may you starve,

May you waste in Hell! 

Oh how the flames touched your roof,

Your home now a smoke-cloud.

Did you know, Akki, this was the doing 

Of our torches?

May you burn forever, the heat never leaving you.

May even your grandchildren feel its singe.

We sing this song at your death

Not to call forth your spirit, but to trap it!

You who stole from the people of Räkkylä! 

You who grew fat during this famine,

When mothers had to bury their own children!

May your children suffer as ours have.”

-Räkkylä Parish, 1737

My hands were shaking, and not from the Graves’. I had only ever heard of Akki as a goddess, not a noaidi, or shaman.

Kettunen was my mother’s maiden name.
