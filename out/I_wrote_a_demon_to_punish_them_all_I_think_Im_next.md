Look, laugh all you want. I get it. This sounds like some unhinged Tumblr-era *“I cursed my ex and now my walls are bleeding”* fanfic crap. Trust me, when I started this, it was exactly that. Just another joke, or say, what it was meant to be, "copium".

It was petty witchcraft. Call it revenge journaling. A wicked coping mechanism that was masqueraded as creativity. I invented a vengeful demon called **Aserath**.. Why? well, because therapy was expensive, ***hate*** was free.. and I had an oddly imaginative brain with many ideas that spoke for me.

For me, it was just another extension of my psyche... my darkest thoughts and desires.

So I made lore. I drew it sigils. I wrote curses and hexes like poetry, each one tailored to the assholes that walked on me. It made me feel powerful in a life where I wasn’t. It was only meant to hear me through written words.

Now I'm afraid it's beginning to hear the curses I mutter under my breath...

*... and it’s not fun anymore.*

It started with Jeff, my neighbor. A retired meathead with a beer gut and a truck he couldn’t park straight to save his life. He started off annoying - late music, passive-aggressive lawn wars.

Then he escalated. Called me names to my face and behind my back. Deliberately backed into my fence. One time, I saw him smirk as he bumped my mailbox out of alignment with his bumper.

I was angry. Like not confrontational angry, just *coiled*. One morning we got into an argument after I confronted him about his increasingly hostile behaviour towards me and my property.

I won't go into details, but it got nasty real quick. He threatened to jump me, and well, I backed off as I muttered *"I hope you burn alive, scum".*

That night, mid-dinner, my TV routine was interrupted by unnatural, horrid screaming outside and so I looked out the window. I don't even know how I heard it in the first place.

Jeff was stumbling out of his truck. His skin was already lit. No explosion... no visible fire source. Just flame, swallowing him whole. He burned like a phoenix made of gasoline.

His screams weren’t *his*. They were layered. Like hundreds of throats screaming in dissonant harmony -  a choir of the damned, burning in some unseen hell...

The fire report said he’d spilled gasoline somehow. A *tragic* accident.

Right.

I told myself it was coincidence. Horrific timing.

Then there was this co-worker, Kian. Smiled in meetings, stole my project proposal, pitched it word-for-word to our VP. He got a raise... and I got reprimanded.

I didn’t say anything that time. I did confront him, but it was futile. Trying to claim he stole my work wouldn't work either, because everybody was all laurels for him. Great.

It was only after a few hours I came to know he fell down from a flight of stairs in the stairwell and broke his right arm. *I didn't remember cursing him at all, bad luck maybe?*

Not quite.

I opened my notebook one evening as I got home. Just as I surfed through Aserath's lore; something I didn’t remember writing was filled on one of the empty pages in a handwriting that resembled mine;

***“Vengeance requires no permission, only invocation and ideation.”***

I flipped a few more pages and found new entries. New lore... things I never wrote. Paragraphs detailing Aserath’s *ideation phase*. One line read:

***"Subtle indications of Aserath harboring a vessel's body include the blackening of the throat. Many successful conjurors rejoice this moment as the onset of the great unification of Wrath and Man."***

Yeah, I don't remember writing any of this. Could have been me, but it was still something I couldn't really place.

Later that night I woke up close to 4 AM to an itchy, dry throat. I started coughing violently - deep, body-shaking hacks that left me winded. My throat itched too long, and I couldn't really catch any sleep as I found myself coughing almost every minute or so.

When I got up next morning and looked in the mirror, there was a dark mark across the base of my neck. I scraped at it. Nothing came off. It wasn’t on the surface. It was *in* me.

That night onwards, I stopped sleeping well. Every morning, new marks. Faint bruising. My skin started looking like it was dusted with ash. My limbs felt weak.

More pages appeared. This time, a drawing of a body standing upright mid-flame, with Aserath standing behind it, all teeth and jagged silhouette, whispering into its ear.

The lore had changed. Now another addition said:  
***“The more unwilling the conjuror, the more complete is the possession. Fire resists what it cannot consume.”***

I panicked. Something was wrong. New entries, statements, how.. how on earth did they just begin to appear?

So I locked the notebook in a cardboard box. Wrapped it in a pillowcase, and then threw it in my closet. I tried to forget it.

For a while, it stayed quiet.

Until that afternoon.

I was driving home from the store. Just cruising you know, half-distracted, until this helmetless jackass clipped my bumper on a turn, nearly sending me into a street pole. As he passed, he flipped me off.. what a jerk.

Reflexively, almost stupidly, I muttered under my breath: ***“Hope that dick gets what he deserves.”***

I didn’t mean it. I didn’t *feel* it. Yes, it just slipped out.

I kept driving, shaken but intact.

As I approached the four-way crossing I saw something - just a flicker in the corner of my eye. By the footpath, half-shielded by a tree, stood a man.

Naked. Ashen grey, like coal smeared all over his body. Grinning he was, with a mouth far too wide, eyes cold gray and affixed to my face. Not shocked. Not hostile. Just... watching, expectant.

I swerved again, instinctively. Tires screeched. My heart slammed into my ribs. And when my eyes snapped back to the road - and there he was.

The biker, or what was *left* of him.

Twisted under the front of a freight truck that hadn’t even braked. I barely missed the pile-up myself.

My brain short-circuited behind the wheel. He was just ahead of me seconds ago. How the hell did he end up - ?

I didn’t wait to process it. I just drove back.

Home felt wrong the second I opened the door. There was a smell, charcoal, acrid and rotten, thick in the air.

The closet door in my room? It was wide open.

The box? ripped apart... its pillowcase shredded. The scripts were everywhere on the floor and in the room. Scattered across the carpet, pinned to the mirror, stuck to the walls like someone or *something,* had been going through them.

And in the center of it all, my notebook. Open. Waiting.

On it was scribbled an image I didn't draw - Aserath sat upon a pile of hundreds of corpses as they burned away, its face large with a grin and eyes depicted joyous. It sat upon them like a throne made of the damned, as if it was feeding off their souls, and .. their suffering, if they could feel pain.

I didn’t flip any more pages. I didn’t need to. I knew just what I had to do. *Fight fire with fire.*

I grabbed the scripts, the notebook - everything, and walked straight to the living room. I cleaned out the fireplace just for this - to purify this cursed artifact.

The fire... caught really fast. But it didn’t stay ordinary. The flames slowly curled upwards then *outwards,* shaping themselves like something *tall, wrong and hunched -* *like someone standing inside it.*

There was no smoke. Just the heat, flames flicking off its edges. Then - just as sudden as it had appeared, the fiery outline was gone. The flames died off with unnatural silence, like something resting forcefully.

I stood there numb, in the silence of the room, trying to make sense of what I had just seen.

I haven’t written anything since.. and I won’t.

For weeks now, it has been quiet. I came to think that I had purged its presence and any residuals that I may have claimed.

Cursing others... thankfully, that no longer works.

Sleep is better, the marks haven't gone away but.. well, I'm not coughing my lungs out of my body.

Just last night, though - I woke up to that familiar acrid scent I still remember from the day I burned the lore. In one corner of the room, just by the lamp near my closet - I spotted a silheoutte.

The ashen man. He didn't move, nor did he speak - he just stood there grinning, face half masked by the lamp's head, eyes stark black in white and staring into my soul.

He vanished the moment I blinked. The lamp briefly flickered to dim light in the darkness.

I really don’t know what that thing was. But I think I gave it something worse than a form... I gave it a name.

**Aserath.**
