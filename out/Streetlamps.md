I’ll never forget that night. 

I was walking my dog through the edge of the neighborhood, where suburban streets met the thick, hostile woods. The darkness at that hour engulfed anything that wasn’t under the warm, orange glow of the streetlamps, which was oddly comforting. There used to be a refuge I found under those lonely lamps and the surrounding blackness. That barrier insulated me from the rows of houses beyond, leaving my dog and I utterly alone.

As we walked silently down the lit path, I heard a faint footstep fall behind me, out of sync with either mine or my dog’s. A chill ran down my back and I froze. 

Turning around, nothing was illuminated but the pavement. Glancing past the pavement and towards the tree line, my eyes could only grasp the few branches visible in the light. I began to pick up my pace, the shadows in the trees beginning to shift and grow as I left them in my peripheral vision.

It wasn’t ten paces before I heard it again. Several hurried steps, like heavy boots rebounding off concrete, echoed from behind. My dog began barking madly and I quickly swiveled around to find a shaking branch just past the sidewalk, leading into the woods. I stared painfully at it, my sight piercing the darkness, trying to see something, anything, but nothing appeared as my eyes adjusted. Spiny trees formed a wall which my vision couldn’t penetrate. 

I turned back to the road and began trudging along at a quicker pace.

I was moving quick enough that my own steps and heartbeat drowned out the sound of anything else. I was only a few streets from home and it couldn’t come sooner. 

I looked towards the road and watched my long shadow cast against the orange backdrop of the streetlamp above my head. 

I stopped in my tracks. Something wasn’t right. 

A light above my head shouldn’t cast a long shadow. My head spun towards the woods again, searching for the light. Nothing was there, but the metal pole next to me was vibrating, as if struck. I looked up and was blinded by the direct warm glow of the light beaming down.

A heavy metallic clang grounded my eyes to my dog in front of me. He was barking madly towards the end of the street ahead, where the sound echoed far off from us. I tried to see, but the ghost of the lamp bulb lingered in my gaze, obscuring the source of the noise. It sounded like a piece of metal bending and snapping repeatedly, sending the hairs on my neck upright. I clenched my jaw and stumbled backwards a few steps, jerking the dog’s leash with me.

The clanging stopped soon before the ghost faded from my eyes. I looked down the road and saw nothing strange. 

The dog began whimpering and I looked all around me as the wind chilled my skin and grazed my scalp. I fled away from the streetlamps and into the center of the road, distrusting the trees and poles that lingered near. 

Upon my second scan of the environment, I spotted something. Behind me, along the sidewalk, there was a single stretch of darkness where no light shined. 

The streetlamp was… gone. 

I immediately recognized it as the spot where my shadow had fallen wrong. Gone? But how? 

My eyes stung as I stared, looking for an answer. I saw that the distance between the two lights adjacent to the missing pole was the same as the distance between every light on the other side of the street. Glancing along both sides of the road, I could now see that there were twice as many streetlamps on the side I had been walking on. Both in front of and behind me. 

All except for the missing light.

I tugged on the leash and I began to sprint down the road as fast as the dog could follow. Was I overreacting? Was the street designed like this on purpose? Or… is something else happening? I didn’t want to wait and find out. I was going home. 

To get there, I’d have to cross where the sound had come from. And I was swiftly approaching. With wind blowing and the dog panting in my ears, something prevented my gaze from turning upwards, away from my feet, to see what was ahead. Was something there?

The shadow cast from my feet began to grow in front of me. My teeth ached from the pressure of my jaw. I followed the shadow as it grew further down the road straight ahead. Looking up, I could see it. 

The missing streetlamp. 

It was fixated between two other posts on the forest side of the road just ahead. More pressing, however, was my shadow.

It continued to grow, split, and mutate into many spindling depictions of my silhouette as the road reflected brighter and brighter orange light. The same bending, snapping noises filled my ears, echoing from behind, and I locked into a dead sprint, letting go of the leash.

The dog fell behind me and I heard him whimper and cry. I couldn’t turn around. As I approached the end of the street, a loud clang rang out like a scream from the out-of-place streetlamp. It was bending down to my height, its light shining directly towards me, right before my eyes. The air whipped at my wide eyes. The lights following behind me were keeping pace, and I couldn’t stop. 

I ran in a wide arc around the bent streetlamp, its gaze following me in my peripheral vision the whole time as I turned into the next street. 

The lights and sounds behind me dimmed as I raced into the empty street, devoid of any lights whatsoever. I passed the next turn, sending me onto the street with my house. I didn’t turn around once. I struggled to pull out the right key and twist open the door with my shaking hands. I didn’t sleep that night.

In the days proceeding that night, I passed around missing posters for my dog. I never found him. I stopped walking at night. I avoid passing that street when I can, and I don’t tell people this story. The few times I’ve been back there seemingly prove that nothing odd occurred that night. All the streetlamps are in proper, identical order across both sides of the street. I still don’t know what happened that night.
