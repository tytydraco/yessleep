Hi, my name is Sarah Williams... or at least it used to be.  
  
I used to be a normal sixteen-year-old girl, who lived in a normal household, in a normal house, on a normal street. well, I wasn't exactly normal, as ever since I was little, I could see things no one else could.  
  
I met many strange people throughout my childhood, with my favourite being Minty. minty was a sweet and pretty kitty with black button eyes and striped fur in mint green and pastel pink, hence her name. She always had a smile full of super sharp, yellow teeth and pastel purple paws. She very was strange, but she was my best friend.  
  
I remember talking to Minty for ages, as well as drawing together. we worked as a team, with Minty giving me the ideas and me drawing them. we drew many things together, all in beautiful pastel colours. one symbol that minty liked the best was a circle with a cross in the middle. it confused and awed me at the same time.  
  
as I grew older, unlike most teenage girls, I dressed in pretty doll-like clothes and still talked to Minty. the girls at my school were ruthless, calling me "baby doll" "pinkie" and "airhead" but I simply ignored them and just drew in my notebook. Deep inside, however, I was pretty upset. while I loved Minty, I thought at least making some human friends.  
  
oh and if you thought I could talk to my parents, you can forget it. Mom and Dad were more worried about my mental health, due to talking to Minty as much as I did. they also hated my drawings for some reason. they often took me to see Mr summers the psychiatrist because of them. it wasn't fair! I mean what's wrong with me drawing me and Minty having a picnic? so what if we had it among the corpses of my bullies, minty liked it!  
  
anyway, one day, I was sitting alone on my bench when Kelly Edwards came sauntering up and began insulting me. like a good girl, I ignored her... until she grabbed my notebook and began looking at my precious drawings! I lunged at her to get them back, but the she-wolf stepped back, making me fall flat on my face. then without mercy, she ripped my drawings into pieces to "teach me respect".  
  
I lost it! I lunged at her with anger and hatred and this time I managed to tackle her to the ground. I kicked, punched and managed to get a bite in before the teacher pulled us apart. I was suspended from school for that moment of fun and my parents where horrified. they actually decided to send me away to a psychiatric centre!  
  
I ran into my room and cried myself to sleep. how could my parents do this to me? when I awoke, it was midnight with the full moon shining through my window. on my windowsill I saw minty who told me that she wanted me to meet her other friend. curiously I followed her out the window, through the garden and into the woods. when we reached the centre of the forest I met minty's friend.  
  
he was a strange man. we was a long, thin white humanoid with no face. he wore a black suit and a tie and had black tentacles sprouting from his back. he looked rather scary, but I wasn't afraid. after all, any friend of minty was a friend of mine. the strange man told me that he could make sure I never had to go to the sanitorium and I listened with eager ears.  
  
when the horrible men from the psychiatric centre came to take me away, I came down when my parents called me. however when they saw me, everyone froze in shock. mother even fainted.  
  
my once blonde hair was dyed pastel pink and tied up into pigtails with one green ribbon and one purple. my face was painted white with green lipstick, a pink nose and three diamonds on my forehead in green, purple and pink. I was wearing a white ruff and a strapless dress in black, lilac and mint green. I also wore mint green sleeveless gloves and black knee-high boots. I looked perfect, but the reason everyone froze was because in my hand, with a pastel pink handle was a big sharp axe.  
  
before anyone could react, I charged downstairs and hacked father's throat so hard his head came clean off. I then hacked the two bad men into pieces, making sure not to get any blood on my lovely dress. finally, mother tried to stop my so unfortunately, I had split her head in two.  
  
after I'd finished my fun, I drew a circle with a cross through it on the wall and told minty everything that had happened. she was delighted as she never really liked my parents anyway. exited and shocked with what I had just done, I giggled, which turned into a chuckle, which soon turned into a long laugh. then me and minty went into the forest where my new friend was waiting.  
  
my name was Sarah Williams... but now it is pastel.
