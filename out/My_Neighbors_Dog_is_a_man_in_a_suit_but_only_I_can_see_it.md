This has been a very hard year for me. 
Just a week into January, I lost both of my parents in a car accident. They raised me in a small town in North Carolina; the name of which I won’t say here for privacy. They were good parents, and I consider myself lucky to say I have nothing but good memories from my childhood with them, excluding the rare arguments we would have. In their defense, I can honestly say i was in the wrong every time, and they were just trying to look out for me, something i was oblivious to at the time. 

The news of their sudden passing seemed to slow down time. I would sleep for what felt like days on end, obsessing over all the ways i could have been a better son in the short amounts of time i was awake. I stopped taking care of myself, and my attendance at work suffered. If not for my girlfriend of 5 years, Rebecca, forcing me to eat, i would have withered away. 

I was one of the pallbearers at their funeral. In the rain, I helped carry the casket containing my mother to her final resting place, my brother following close behind, struggling to keep his composure long enough to help carry my father across the wet grass of the cemetery. I couldn’t help but remember the rainy days at the beach we would spend together while on vacation. The weather would never bother my mother, she was just happy to be at her favorite place. It was her dream to own a beach-house one day so that she could enjoy it every single day. Wherever she is now, I hope theres nothing but white sands and warm sun for her. 

My brother and I sold their house, neither one of us could stand to move into it. My brother stayed with Me and Rebecca for a few more weeks before flying back to Florida for school. We decided it would be best for me if we moved a few towns over; the place i grew up in was filled with too many memories. 
Between the money i received from my parents life insurance and my half from selling their home, we were able to move into a nice house about an hour away from where we were. 

We arrived in our rental truck on a warm Sunday afternoon. We began unloading quickly, so i could return the truck before they could charge us any more for it. I sat a box labeled “Kitchen Shit” onto the granite countertop, chuckling at the phrasing she had used when packing. I walked back outside to grab the next vaguely labeled box when i saw them for the first time. It was an old couple, well into their retirement years with deep purple bags under their eyes walking a dog, a Great Pyrenees. I was instantly taken back at the size of the dog. Its body and limbs were large and lumpy, and its head moved with an unsettling stiffness. I shrugged it off, thinking the dog just had some medical issues, and went back to unpacking. 
After a few trips back and forth, I realized i hadn’t seen my girlfriend in about an hour. I look around the house, my calls for her echo off of the freshly painted walls and receive no answer. I make my way outside to see if she was in the moving truck, to see the opened cab still full of boxes, but she is still nowhere to be seen. I hear a faint laugh come from the other side of the truck, I walk around it to find Rebecca talking with the neighbors I had saw earlier. I begin to approach them when I see her extend a hand downwards to pet their dog. He was so much more grotesque up close. The dog’s skin looked loose with patchy fur, the way it moved almost robotic. I was so transfixed on the large, lumpy limbs that it took me a moment to see that the dog had began to lick at Rebecca’s arm. My stomach churned at the sight. Behind the loose skin around the dog’s mouth, revealed a set of human teeth, the gums plagued with Gingivitis, its yellowed tongue lapped at her arm before I pull her away. 

“What the fuck is that thing?!” I asked in a panic 

Both the old couple and Rebecca looked at me with a mix of confusion and concern

“Our dog..?” Says the old man, breaking the silence. 

“We both know that’s not a dog, I’m not sure what kind of prank this is, but it’s not funny!” I say, grabbing Rebecca’s arm and leading her away. 

She pulled her arm away from my hand, giving me a scornful look, before turning her attention back towards the old couple. 

“I’m so sorry” she says with a frustrated sigh. 
“I’ll talk to him.” 

She turns and walks back to our house, and i follow. As soon as the door closes behind us, i realize just how angry she is. 

“That was so embarrassing!” She yells.
“What is your problem?” 

“Did you not see what was going on?!” I reply. “That “dog” you were letting lick you was a man! All three of those people are freaks!” 

“Stop.” She cut me off. 
“I know you’re going through a lot. I know you’re stressed. But there is nothing wrong with that family.” She said. 
“I need you to relax. I’m just trying to make friends with our new neighbors. They’re going out of town next month, and i told them we would dog-sit for them.” 

I try and protest. “But-“ 

I am once again cut off. “Enough!” She says with an exasperated tone. 
“Take a moment to relax. I’m going back to unpacking.” She said before walking back to the truck. 

I can tell she is upset with me. I didn’t mean to embarrass her, but I have no idea how she didn’t see what was going on right in front of her. 

I don’t know what to say to her. She is the type of person who never goes back on her word, but there is no way I can let that thing into our home. I only have a month to find a way out of this. 

I can’t talk to her about it without her thinking i’m losing it, so I wanted to ask you all for advice.
