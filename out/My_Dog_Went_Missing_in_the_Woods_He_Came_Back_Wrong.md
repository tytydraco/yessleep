I don’t know what came back from the woods.
But it wasn’t Max.

I live alone in the northern part of Vermont. Not deep wilderness, but rural enough that my nearest neighbor is half a mile down the road, and the forest behind my house goes on for miles. I moved out here after my divorce, hoping for some quiet, some peace. Just me, my old dog, and a bit of land to call mine.

Max was a mutt. German shepherd and something else—maybe lab or collie. Big, loyal, dumb as bricks. He liked chasing squirrels and barking at shadows. He’d been with me for eight years, and honestly, he was the only thing that kept me sane after everything fell apart.

Last week, he ran off into the woods and didn’t come back.

It was just past sunset. We were out back, him sniffing around while I stacked firewood. Then he froze—ears up, tail stiff—and bolted into the tree line like something had called him. I shouted, but he didn’t even hesitate. Just vanished between the birches.

I waited with a flashlight until midnight. Nothing.

I searched the woods all the next day. I called his name until my throat was raw. No barking. No paw prints. No disturbed underbrush. Like he’d just been… erased.

By the third day, I stopped looking.

I left his food bowl out anyway. Hope makes you stupid like that.

On the fifth night, just past 3 a.m., I heard scratching at the back door.

My heart damn near exploded.

I grabbed the flashlight, ran downstairs, and there he was. Sitting on the porch like he’d just gone for a stroll—dirty, tail thumping weakly against the boards.

“Max!” I shouted, tears already blurring my vision. “Jesus, Max—where the hell did you go?”

He wagged his tail harder and leaned into my chest when I opened the door. His fur smelled like wet leaves and mildew, but I didn’t care. I dropped to my knees and hugged him.

He didn’t lick my face. Max always licked my face.

I chalked it up to exhaustion.

It took me a day to realize something was wrong.

Max was… off. Not limping or hurt, but different. Detached. He followed me around the house like normal, but there was no spark in his eyes. No barking at passing cars. No growling at the mailman. No interest in toys or treats. He just watched me.

All the time.

Sometimes I’d find him sitting in the hallway, perfectly still, staring into the corner.

Other times I’d catch him watching me sleep. Not curled up by the bed like usual, but sitting upright in the doorway. Perfect posture. Head tilted. Silent.

At night, I heard him moving. Pacing. His claws tapping across the hardwood. But every time I got up to check, he’d be in the same spot—laying by the fireplace, breathing slow and steady.

And then there was the thing with his reflection.

Max used to hate mirrors. If he caught his reflection in the TV screen, he’d bark and back away.

Now? He stares at them.

I noticed it one night when I was brushing my teeth. I glanced at the bathroom mirror and nearly dropped the toothbrush—Max was sitting behind me in the doorway, unmoving, staring directly into the glass.

His reflection wasn’t staring at me.
It was staring at itself. And it didn’t blink.

I tried to get him to look away. Called his name. Snapped my fingers.

Nothing.

Just that steady, vacant gaze.

I moved closer and waved my hand in front of his face. Finally, he blinked—slowly, like it was an afterthought—and turned his head toward me. For a second, I could’ve sworn his pupils were too big. Too wide. Too human.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Two days ago, I woke up to find Max standing on the kitchen table.

Just standing there. Like a statue.

He didn’t move until I touched him—and even then, it wasn’t a startled jump. It was slow. Mechanical. He stepped down one leg at a time and padded out of the room like nothing happened.

That same night, I found dirt in the hallway. Not tracked paw prints—just a mound of black earth, like someone had dumped a shovel of soil from the woods onto my floor.

I cleaned it up.

It came back the next morning.

Last night, I followed him.

He got up at 2:14 a.m. I heard the back door creak open. I grabbed my flashlight and slipped outside after him.

The air was ice-cold. Moonless.

Max was moving fast. Through the brush. No hesitation. No noise. I kept my light low and my distance close, following the sound of his steps.

He led me deep into the woods—past the creek, past the old hunting blind, into a part I hadn’t explored before. The trees thinned out, and I saw movement ahead.

Max was sitting in front of something.

It looked like a shallow pit. Maybe ten feet wide, six feet deep. Freshly dug. The dirt was wet. Mounded around the edges like something had crawled out.

Or maybe in.

Max turned to look at me.

His eyes reflected the flashlight beam—like an animal’s. But instead of the usual green-blue shine, they were red. Dull and heavy, like blood soaked through paper.

He didn’t growl. He didn’t bark.

He just smiled.

At least, it looked like a smile. His lips peeled back too far. Teeth too white. Too even.

Then he stood and walked around the pit and disappeared into the trees.

I didn’t follow.

This morning, there were two bowls of food gone. Two spots in the snow melted where bodies had slept.

Max is sleeping at my feet now. But I swear he’s not alone.

Sometimes I catch him looking into corners again. Not with curiosity.

With anticipation.

Like he’s waiting.

And earlier, I found another mound of dirt by the door.

This one had something sticking out of it.

A bone.

Not a dog bone.
A finger.

I don’t know what came back from the woods. But it isn’t Max.

And I don’t think it came back alone.

I didn’t go to work. Didn’t check my email. Didn’t answer calls.

Instead, I drove into town and bought every motion-activated camera the hardware store had. Trail cams, baby monitors, even a few cheap security ones. I told the clerk I had a coyote problem. He gave me a tight smile and didn’t ask questions.

When I got back home, I set them up everywhere.

One in the hallway, one in the living room, two in the backyard, one pointed at Max’s bowl, and three around the perimeter of the woods. I linked them to a basic monitor on my desk and kept the feed up all night.

Max watched me while I installed them.

He didn’t move. Didn’t make a sound.

Just sat there on the floor, staring, as if he already knew what I’d see.

That first night, I didn’t sleep.

I watched the feeds until my eyes burned.

At 1:23 a.m., Max stood up.

The hallway camera caught it. He rose—slowly, unnaturally—and walked out of frame. The living room cam picked him up next. He passed through without even glancing at the lens. Just heading for the back door.

I leaned forward in my chair.

On the backyard feed, the door opened by itself. Max stepped outside.

Then the footage glitched.

Not a full static burst—more like a flicker. The kind you get when frames are missing. One second he was walking past the firepit. The next, he was standing still, facing the treeline.

The timestamp jumped by four seconds.

Then the other cameras started triggering.

Movement in the woods. Three different feeds. Shapes passing between trees—tall shapes. Too tall. I squinted, adjusted the brightness, but the figures stayed just out of the light.

Their limbs didn’t move right.

They glided.

Max was still in the same spot. Unmoving.

Then he turned his head—not toward the woods.

Toward the camera.

And he smiled again.

That too-wide grin. Teeth too flat, too many of them. Like something had drawn a dog from memory but never seen one up close.

The backyard feed cut out.

I checked the camera the next morning. The lens had been smashed in.

The mount was twisted, almost melted. No footprints. Just more dirt. Another mound at the treeline. This one was shaped like a child. Small. Curled.

I didn’t dig.

I kept watching the footage every night.

It kept getting worse.

Max left the house at the same time each night. 1:23 a.m. Exactly. Sometimes he stood still. Other times he disappeared for hours before coming back soaked in mud, paws black with something thicker than soil.

The shapes in the woods came closer each time.

The third night, they stood at the edge of the yard.

The fourth night, they were on the porch.

The fifth night, they were inside.

I didn’t see how they got in. No doors opened. No windows broke. One frame they were gone—the next, they were standing in my living room.

Seven figures.

Tall. Pale. Wrong.

And Max stood in the middle of them, tail wagging slow, like a metronome. His mouth hung open, panting—but the sound didn’t match. I swear to God it sounded like whispering. Like multiple voices, speaking all at once in a language I couldn’t understand.

Then all eight of them turned.

They looked at the camera.

And every feed cut to black.

That was last night.

This morning, all the cameras were gone.

Not broken.

Gone.

Even the mounts. Even the cords. As if they were never there.

Max is still here. Lying by the fireplace.

But now there’s something new.

A smell.

Like rot and iron. Like the inside of something dead.

And behind the couch, where the living room cam used to be, I found a handprint.

Not a paw print. A human hand.

Long fingers. Sharp nails. But pressed into the wall at shoulder height—as if whoever left it had crawled out from inside the floor.

I tried to take a picture. My phone won’t turn on.

None of them will.

And I know they’re coming back tonight.

They let me see them. They wanted me to.

Because now I’ve started to hear the whispering, even when I’m awake.

Not from outside.

From Max.

He hasn’t moved in two hours.
He hasn’t blinked once.
And I think… I think he’s smiling again.

Please.

If anyone’s reading this—if anyone’s seen anything like this before—tell me what to do.

Because I don’t think I can stay here tonight.

But I also don’t think they’ll let me leave.
