My heart sank. The words were not a threat—they were a promise. I glanced around the room. Everything seemed normal, yet wrong. The colours were off, the shadows a little too deep, the silence too heavy. I reached out and touched my desk. It felt real, but it was like touching something through a thick layer of water—distant, muted.

And then I saw it: a subtle movement in the reflection of my laptop screen. I wasn’t alone.

I turned slowly, my breath hitching in my throat. In the corner of the room stood the figure again, but this time, its face was more defined—closer to mine. It stared directly at me, unblinking, and I realised with a jolt of horror that it had my face.

Not exactly my face, but a version of it. Twisted, corrupted, its eyes black and hollow, its mouth stretched into a grimace of pain and rage. It began to whisper, a garbled, disjointed language that I couldn’t understand but felt deep within me.

I backed away, my body trembling, but the room seemed to stretch out, the walls elongating, twisting like a funhouse nightmare. The figure moved closer, the air around it warping like heat rising from a flame.

My laptop screen blinked, and new text began to appear:

**"YOU CANNOT RUN FROM YOURSELF."**

  
  


I felt a sharp pain in my chest, a burning sensation that spread through my veins like ice. I looked down and saw dark veins snaking up my arms, pulsing with some black, oily substance. I could feel it crawling under my skin, spreading, and I knew that whatever it was, it was consuming me from the inside out.

The pain was unbearable, searing through every nerve in my body. I tried to scream, but only a ragged whisper came out. The room twisted around me, and I was falling—falling into the dark, into the endless void, the whispers growing louder, more frantic.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

I was back in the library. Not the campus library—the endless, dark one. I was on the floor, gasping for air, my body aching. The figure was gone, but I could still feel its presence lingering, watching, waiting.

The shelves towered around me, stretching up into blackness. I stood up on shaky legs, looking around for a way out, but the aisles seemed to go on forever, twisting and winding like a maze. There was no end, no exit.

And then, faintly, I heard it—the sound of footsteps. Soft at first, but growing louder, closer, more insistent, echoing through the endless maze of shelves. At first, they seemed distant, but they were closing in—quickly. Panic gripped me. I turned, my breath shallow and ragged, trying to make sense of this nightmare. But it didn’t make sense. None of it did.

I began to move, dragging myself through the maze, each step a struggle against the crushing weight of dread. I could hear the footsteps splitting, multiplying, like there were dozens—no, hundreds—of feet tapping and shuffling through the narrow aisles. And then came the whispers again, barely audible but all around me, overlapping and intertwining like a chorus of madness.

“Come back…”“You must see…”“It’s too late…”

I clutched my head, trying to drown out the voices, but they burrowed deeper, seeping into my thoughts like oil spreading through water. I stumbled forward, turning corner after corner, hoping to find an exit, any exit. But the shelves went on forever, and the books that filled them—thousands of them—seemed wrong. Some were ancient, bound in cracked leather or brittle paper, titles in languages I couldn’t read. Others looked new, untouched, yet there were no titles, just blank spines.

I reached out and pulled one from the shelf, my hand trembling. I opened it, and my blood turned to ice. Every page was filled with dense, handwritten text—but it was my handwriting. Thousands of pages, thousands of words, all written by me… or something that knew me. My thoughts, my fears, my dreams—all laid out in obsessive detail. I flipped faster, pages blurring by, but they all said the same things over and over, like a manic chant.

*“He can’t run. He can’t hide. He can’t run. He can’t hide.”*

I dropped the book, and it landed on the floor with a heavy thud. The whispers stopped, and for a moment, there was silence. Too much silence. It was as if the whole world had been muted, my own heartbeat the only sound. I felt my mind fraying, a primal panic clawing at my sanity. I needed to get out.

I turned and ran, my feet pounding against the cold, hard floor. The aisles blurred around me, and I could feel the air thickening, growing colder. The shelves seemed to stretch and warp, their angles becoming unnatural. And then I saw something in the distance—a figure standing motionless at the end of a long, dark aisle.

I stopped dead in my tracks, my breath hitching. The figure was turned away from me, hunched and shrouded in shadow. But there was something horribly familiar about its posture, the way it stood, almost mirroring me.

I took a step back, and its head twitched, as if hearing my movement. Slowly, it began to turn, and as it did, the shadows around it seemed to melt away, revealing its face. My face.

It was me, but… not me. Its eyes were hollow, just dark, endless pits that seemed to pull me in. Its mouth was wide open, too wide, and from its throat came a guttural noise—a choked, gurgling whisper.

“Come here,” it rasped, a distorted echo of my own voice. “Come see…”

The thing began to stagger toward me, its movements jerky and unnatural, as if it was being pulled by strings. Its mouth opened wider, impossibly wide, until its jaw seemed to unhinge, splitting its face in half. The inside was not flesh or bone but a churning void, a swirling mass of shadows and eyes that blinked independently, each one filled with hunger.

I turned and ran again, faster than before, my lungs burning, but the aisles seemed to stretch endlessly. I glanced back over my shoulder and saw the figure still coming, shambling faster now, its limbs contorting in unnatural angles. Its gurgling chant grew louder, overlapping with a cacophony of whispers that filled the air, each word clawing into my mind.

And then I felt it—a wet, warm sensation on my face. I reached up, my hand trembling, and wiped at it. Blood. My nose was bleeding, just like Mark’s had. I looked at my hand, now slick and red, and then at the walls, where the bookshelves seemed to breathe, the wood expanding and contracting like ribs beneath skin.

“Stay calm,” I whispered to myself, but my voice broke, trembling. “Stay calm…”

I kept moving, ducking down a narrow aisle that twisted sharply to the left. I didn’t care where I was going, just as long as it was away from that… thing. My own doppelgänger. But the footsteps behind me were relentless, a rapid shuffle that seemed to echo inside my skull.

Then I heard something else. A scraping sound, like nails on a chalkboard, coming from the shelves themselves. I glanced to my right and felt my stomach twist. Hands. Pale, disembodied hands were emerging from between the books, their fingers long and skeletal, nails sharp and cracked. They reached out, grasping blindly, desperate to grab hold of anything—of me.

One hand brushed my arm, and a searing pain shot through me, like I’d been branded with a hot iron. I yanked away, my skin burning, and stumbled further down the aisle. But the hands kept coming, more of them now, reaching out from every shelf, every book, stretching and twisting like they were growing longer by the second.

The air around me grew heavier, thicker, like I was moving through syrup. Each breath was a struggle, and my vision began to blur. I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears, the blood rushing through my veins like a roaring river.

And then I saw it. At the end of the aisle, bathed in a cold, dim light, stood a doorway—a simple, black iron door, slightly ajar. It didn’t belong here. Nothing about it made sense. But it was an exit, and I needed to take it.

I sprinted toward the door, ignoring the pain, the blood, the whispers. The hands clawed at my clothes, tearing at the fabric, but I kept moving. I reached the doorway, slamming my shoulder into it, bursting through.

I fell forward, crashing onto a hard, cold floor. The door slammed shut behind me with a deafening bang. I scrambled to my feet, gasping, and looked around.

I was in a different place. A room—dark, cramped, and suffocating. The walls were made of damp, mouldy wood, and the air was thick with the scent of rot and something sour, like spoiled milk. The floor was slick, and I realised with a sinking feeling that I was standing in a thin pool of dark, viscous liquid.

I glanced down and saw the liquid crawling up my legs like tendrils, thick and tar-like. I tried to move, but my feet wouldn’t budge. The liquid continued to rise, now up to my knees, and I felt something solid brushing against my skin—small, round objects that bumped against me in the dark muck.

My hands went cold as I reached down and pulled one out—a human tooth, yellowed and broken. I dropped it, my breath catching in my throat. More objects began to rise to the surface—teeth, fingers, bits of bone—all swirling in the thick, black liquid, carried by some unseen current.

I could hear the whispers again, growing louder, more frantic. They were closer now, like they were right inside my ears. I covered my ears, but it didn’t help. The liquid continued to rise, now up to my waist, and I could feel it pulling me down, dragging me into whatever abyss lay below.

“Please, stop!” I screamed, but my voice was swallowed by the dark. The walls around me seemed to pulse and contract, like a living thing, and I saw them start to bleed—thick, dark rivulets running down in slow, deliberate streams.

Suddenly, a face emerged from the wall directly in front of me. It pushed out from the wood, stretching like it was trapped beneath a thin layer of skin. It was Mark’s face, twisted in agony, his mouth opening wide in a silent scream, his eyes rolling in his skull.

Then more faces began to push through the walls—students, people I knew, people I’d never seen—all of them distorted, their features contorted in pain. Their mouths opened and closed, and from each of them came the same whispered chant:

**“Join us. Join us. Join us…”**

The liquid was up to my chest now, and I could feel it filling my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. My vision started to blur again, black spots dancing in my eyes. I was drowning in the dark, in the voices, in the terror.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving—a shadow slipping through the black liquid, circling me, closing in. It was huge, its presence overwhelming. I could feel its eyes on me, watching, waiting.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The liquid reached my chin, and I could see the faces starting to shift, to stretch, to merge together into one monstrous, twisted visage that filled the room.

And then, just as the liquid reached my mouth, I heard a voice—clear, sharp, cutting through the darkness, piercing and familiar, yet twisted in its intensity. It was my own voice, but deeper, colder—a mirror image speaking back from some hidden corner of this nightmare.

**"You asked for this."**

The liquid surged over my mouth, flooding into my throat, cold and thick, like swallowing tar. I gagged, choking, my lungs burning as I tried to cough it out, but it only poured in deeper, filling every crevice inside me. The panic set in—a primal, animal fear that overpowered everything else. My body convulsed as I tried to fight it, to push back against the dark, but I was sinking deeper into it. I could feel the tendrils of the liquid writhing inside me, wrapping around my bones, rooting themselves in my flesh.

My eyes darted around, desperate for something—anything—to latch onto, to pull myself out of this hell. The walls were closing in, the faces merging into a single grotesque form, their eyes now locked on me, mouths opening wide to scream in silence.

And then the shadow moved. The massive, serpentine shape that had been circling beneath the liquid was rising now, breaking the surface with a slow, deliberate grace. As it emerged, the darkness seemed to peel away from it, revealing a monstrous, elongated head—no eyes, just a gaping maw filled with rows of jagged, broken teeth. The flesh was pale and mottled, like something long dead dredged up from the depths of the sea.

Its mouth opened wider, impossibly wide, a black abyss stretching before me, and from within came a sound that wasn’t a sound at all—a low, rumbling vibration that I could feel in my bones, in my very soul. It was the same vibration from the lab, the one that had rattled Mark, that had bled him from the inside out. I knew that if it reached me now, I wouldn’t survive. It would tear me apart, shred my mind, rip me from reality.

I had to move. I had to do something. I forced my body to respond, my limbs heavy and numb, every movement a battle against the thick liquid. I reached out, grasping at the slick, blood-slicked walls, trying to find a grip, something solid, but the wood was soft, pulpy, like rotting flesh.

The shadow creature continued to rise, and as it did, its body unfolded in impossible ways—limbs that shouldn’t exist, joints that bent backward, wet and cracking. It was larger than I could comprehend, its bulk filling the room, pressing against the walls, and yet it kept expanding, like it was swallowing the space itself.

And then it spoke—without words, without sound, but I heard it in my mind, a voice that was my own, but not my own.

**"YOU CANNOT LEAVE. YOU CANNOT HIDE. YOU BELONG HERE."**

The words hammered into me, each one a crushing weight that drove me further into the darkness. I could feel my mind splintering, fragments of myself breaking off like shattered glass. I had to find something, some tether to hold onto, or I’d lose myself completely.

My hand brushed against something solid, buried in the muck. I grabbed it, pulling it free—a book, its cover black and featureless, slick with the dark liquid. I didn’t know why, but I felt drawn to it, like it was an anchor, a way out.

I opened it, my fingers trembling, the pages heavy and soaked. And there, on the first page, was my name. Not written, but carved deep into the paper, gouged out in jagged, desperate strokes. Below it, more words, carved and bleeding into the page:

**"I AM YOU. YOU ARE ME. WE ARE ONE."**

I felt a sudden, sharp pain in my head, a blinding migraine that split my skull. Memories flooded back—flashes of my life, my childhood, my friends, my family, and then… something else. Memories that weren’t mine. A life that wasn’t mine. Faces I didn’t know, places I’d never been. But they were in me, etched into my mind like scars.

The creature loomed over me, its mouth stretching wider still, ready to consume. I knew, deep down, that this was my end. That I was about to be devoured, not just in body, but in mind, in soul. I’d become part of this place, another whisper in the dark.

But then, something shifted. The book in my hands began to hum, vibrating with a low, resonant frequency that matched the creature’s, but slightly off, just enough to cause a dissonance. I could feel the air around me tremble, and the liquid began to ripple, pulling away from me, retreating back toward the creature.

I didn’t understand what was happening, but I didn’t need to. I clung to the book, holding it close, focusing on the vibrations. They grew stronger, louder, and the creature hesitated, its body trembling. For the first time, I saw fear—or something like it—flicker across its grotesque form.

The walls began to shake, the faces within them distorting further, their mouths stretching open as if they were screaming, but still no sound came out. I could feel the book pulling me, guiding me, and I let it. I closed my eyes, focusing on the rhythm, matching my breath to its pulse.

And then, with a sudden, violent lurch, I was pulled out of the room.

I hit the ground hard, coughing and sputtering, my lungs burning as I gasped for air. I was back in my dorm room, on the floor by my desk. My laptop was there, the screen still glowing, the untitled document open. The words had changed again:

**"IT'S NOT OVER."**

I scrambled back, knocking over my chair, my eyes wide with panic. I could still feel it—the cold, the liquid, the creature’s presence, lingering just behind the thin veneer of reality. The room felt wrong, slightly off, like a copy made from a faulty memory. The walls were too close, the colours too dull, and shadows crawled where they shouldn’t.

I reached for my phone, desperate for a lifeline, but when I turned it on, the screen was filled with static. The clock blinked erratically, numbers jumping and shifting—2:15, 7:49, 3:33. None of it made sense. I tried to call someone—anyone—but the line was dead, replaced by that same low, rumbling hum.

I looked at my reflection in the darkened screen, and my heart skipped a beat. My eyes—my own eyes were wrong. Dark, hollow, just like the doppelgänger's. And then the whispers started again, soft, almost tender.

**“You are here. You are home.”**

I turned away, my body trembling, every instinct screaming to get out, to leave this place. But where would I go? Where could I go? The campus felt miles away, another world altogether. My thoughts raced, skittering like insects across the surface of my mind, and then I realised with a sinking dread—I was never meant to leave. This place had its hooks in me now, deep and irrevocable.

I felt a cold breeze wash over me, and I turned toward the window. The night outside was darker than it should have been—no stars, no moon, just an inky void that stretched on forever. And from that darkness, I saw movement. Slow, deliberate shapes shifting, crawling closer.

I backed away, my breath quickening, but I could feel it—the room getting smaller, the walls closing in. I needed to get out, to break free. I grabbed the door handle and twisted, but it wouldn’t budge. I pulled harder, but it was like the door had fused to the wall. Panic set in. I turned back to the window, and the shapes were closer now, pressing against the glass, hands, faces, bodies blending together, forming a single mass of darkness.

And then, from behind me, that voice again—clear, sharp, and undeniably my own:

**"It’s time to see the truth."**

The window shattered, and the darkness flooded in.

The darkness enveloped me, not like a curtain falling but like a tide rushing in, thick and suffocating. My body felt weightless, suspended in a void that stretched infinitely in all directions. There was no up or down, no sense of time or space—just the overwhelming sensation of being pulled, twisted, and stretched. I could feel myself breaking apart, my thoughts unravelling like threads from a frayed rope.

**"It’s time to see the truth."** The voice echoed in the emptiness, my own voice, yet laced with something else—something ancient and malevolent. It rippled through the dark, a vibration that thrummed against my bones.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. My lungs filled with the dark liquid again, cold and thick, and I could feel it worming its way deeper, filling every corner of my being. It wasn’t just drowning me—it was becoming me, intertwining with my nerves, my blood, my thoughts. And then, like a knife cutting through the fog, a searing pain erupted in my skull—a blinding migraine that split me apart from the inside.

Images flashed before me, rapid and disjointed—a whirlwind of memories, real and imagined. My childhood home, my mother’s face, the smell of my father’s aftershave. And then, other places, other faces—old stone buildings crumbling in the dark, twisted trees with roots like claws, people I had never met but whose names I somehow knew. I was slipping into them, or they were slipping into me. I couldn't tell anymore. Reality was collapsing, and with it, my mind.

The liquid seemed to recoil, and for a moment, there was silence. The pressure eased just enough for me to focus, and I could see something—a light, faint and distant, flickering in the dark like a dying star. I felt a pull toward it, a small, instinctual tug that seemed to offer a way out, a thin thread of hope in this abyss.

I reached for it, my movements sluggish and heavy, my limbs feeling like they were moving through molasses. The closer I got, the more the light seemed to shift, changing shape, morphing into something familiar. And then I saw it clearly: a page, a single page from the untitled document, suspended in the void.

I knew I shouldn’t touch it. Every part of me screamed that it was a trap, that I was being lured in. But there was something there, something I needed to see, to understand. My hand trembled as I reached out, my fingers brushing against the surface of the page.

The words on it were alive, shifting and crawling like insects on skin. They were written in my own handwriting, but the ink bled and oozed, forming new shapes, new sentences that twisted and wriggled like they were trying to escape the page.

**"IT WAS NEVER THE DOCUMENT. IT WAS ALWAYS YOU."**

And then I understood. It wasn’t the document that was cursed. It wasn’t the file, the computer, the room. It was me. I had been the conduit, the doorway, the weak link that allowed something to seep through. The document had been a symptom, a warning, but I’d ignored it, dug too deep, tried too hard to understand.

The light intensified, and the page began to burn, curling at the edges, blackening and turning to ash. I could feel it in my mind, like a piece of me was being torn away, something vital and fragile. The dark liquid surged again, wrapping around me, pulling me back, and I realised with a sickening clarity that I was being consumed, not by the darkness, but by the knowledge itself.

The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of voices, overlapping and merging until they were a single, deafening roar. I tried to cover my ears, but it was inside me, vibrating through every cell, every fibre.

**"YOU ARE THE DOOR. YOU ARE THE WAY."**

I felt myself slipping, falling into that endless void, my consciousness fracturing, splintering like a shattered mirror. Pieces of myself floated away, and I could feel them being swallowed by the dark, devoured by the thing that lurked within.

But then, from somewhere deep inside, a different feeling—a spark, a memory, a flicker of something pure. It was faint, almost lost amidst the chaos, but it was there. I latched onto it, holding on with everything I had left.

It was a face. Her face. Emily. I’d almost forgotten her in all of this, but now she was the only thing holding me together. I could see her smile, hear her laugh. She was the light in all of this, the one thing that was still real, still mine.

The darkness seemed to recoil, just for a moment, as if it sensed the intrusion. I pushed back, using every ounce of strength I had left, focusing on that memory, that light. I could feel it pushing back against the void, a small but growing force.

The liquid began to drain away, the pressure easing as the shadows pulled back. I could see the outlines of a room forming around me—my room, but not quite right, not quite real. The walls were still too close, the colours muted, but it was something, a tether to the world I knew.

I forced my body to move, to crawl forward, dragging myself out of the void and back into the semblance of reality. The light was still there, flickering, wavering, but strong enough to guide me.

I collapsed onto the floor, coughing and retching, the taste of the dark liquid still thick in my throat. My hands were shaking, my skin pale and clammy. I could feel it still, lurking just beneath the surface, waiting, watching. But I was here, and I was still me—for now.

I looked up, and my laptop screen was still on, the untitled document open. But the text had changed again, the words now etched deep into the screen, impossible to delete:

**"THIS ISN'T OVER."**

I stared at it, my breath ragged, my heart pounding. I knew that whatever this was, it wasn’t done with me. It was still there, still connected, waiting for the next moment of weakness, the next crack to slip through.

But I had something now—something it didn’t expect. I had the light. I had her memory. And I’d hold onto it, fight for it, as long as I could.

The dark would come again, and when it did, I’d be ready.
