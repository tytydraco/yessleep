I have been living in a small town in the countryside of northern Louisiana for a few years now, it has always been great. I bought a fairly big house with my wife and now we are raising our two beatiful children, Maria and James. There's just over a thousand people living in this town which just what we wanted. We have everything we could've ever asked for. However, at the end of last year, weird things started happening.  A lot of animals were being killed during the night, even in broad daylight. I remember a farmer who claimed to have seen a weird creature prowling around his farm, he described it as a humanlike body with elongated extremities, but we didn't listen to him since he has a record of lying to get attention of the local newspaper, and since his animals weren't killed, we didn't believe him.

One night, I heard weird noises in the backyard, but since we have a dog I assumed it was him. The next night the noises returned and, since the dog was in my bedroom, I said to myself that it must be a wild animal who found our house and now spends the nights there, hiding from other animals. After a week or so of peace, I heard the noises again. I decided to go to the backyard and check what was going on, as I stepped into the grass that covers our backyard I heard what seemed to me at the time like heavy breathing, and seconds later, something walking over the leaves that covered the first few meters of forest, something clumsy that for the noises it made it didn't seem real. I ran back to the house to get a flashlight, a knife and to put my boots on, I also grabbed my wristwatch, I checked and it was 4 a.m.. As I ventured into the forest, I had a strange sensation, as if something was watching me, This forest was, at most around 5 miles long and 2 miles. I could already see that dawn was starting, that meant I had been walking in a straight line for just over two and a half hours, I checked the physical activity tab on my watch, as I stared at the screen panic started to kick in:

`Distance walked:`

`7.3 miles, NEW RECORD`

I couldn't understand what was going on. The forest was suppossed to end two and a half miles ago. As I stared into the distance, thinking what would happen to me, I catched a glimpse of a light. From what I could see, it looked to be inside of a construction and less than half a mile away. I started walking, feeling that I was going to be saved but as I approached the building, my opinion changed quickly. 

The building was abandoned, and it looked like it had been abandoned for a long time now. Since I was lost, I decided to enter the facility. It was quite big and a lot more modern than what it looked like from the outside. I started looking for food or water, but I found something much darker than I expected.
