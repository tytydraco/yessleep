When I was a child, I used to wave at someone from my bedroom window every night. That’s what my parents remember.

They tell it like it’s funny. Like it was just one of those harmless kid things. I’d stand on my bed, pull the curtain back, and wave out into the dark. Same time every night. Same slow, careful motion of my hand.

They thought I’d made up an imaginary friend. What they don’t remember is me screaming when they tried to stop me. 

I was five, old enough to know the difference between pretending and being careful.

My bedroom faced the back garden. Past the fence was a narrow strip of trees, then nothing, just darkness where the streetlights didn’t quite reach. I hated that window during the day. At night, I couldn’t look away from it.

The first time I saw it, I thought it was a man. Tall, standing just beyond the fence, where the shadows blurred everything together. He didn’t move, didn’t wave back. Just stood there, head tilted slightly, like he was listening.

I hid under my blanket until morning, the second night, he was closer. Right up against the fence, that’s when I noticed his arms.

They were too long. Hanging past where his knees should’ve been, his hands rested on the wood, fingers curling over the top like hooks.

I didn’t scream, I didn’t cry. Something in my chest told me that noise was a bad idea. Instead, I waved.

His head lifted. Slowly, deliberately, with care. He didn’t have a face the way people do. Just a pale, smooth shape where features should’ve been, except for a mouth, thin and stretched wide, like it had been pulled that way over time.

He waved back, not copying me, but practicing. Every night after that, he came closer. Fence, garden path, grass beneath my window. I learned the rules without being told. If I waved, he stayed outside, If I missed a night, he stood closer the next time.

Once, when I was sick and fell asleep early, I woke to tapping on the glass, not knocking, but instead it was his fingernails on the glass. I screamed so loud my lungs nearly exploded.

I remember my parents running in, the lights turning on, the shape outside retreating into the dark so fast it looked like it folded in on itself. After that, they made a rule.

No standing on the bed, no opening the curtains at night.

That’s when I started being paranoid. Not because I was scared of him, because I knew what would happen if I didn’t wave.

For weeks, I cried myself every night to sleep, until they finally gave in, just a little. The curtain could stay open, I could stand on the floor, I could wave once, quickly.

The tapping stopped. Eventually, it stopped coming altogether.

I grew up, we moved house. The memories softened around the edges, the way childhood things do. When I asked my parents about it years later, they laughed.

“You just liked waving at the trees,” my mother said. “You always had a big imagination.” I believed them.

Until last month. I was helping my dad clear out old boxes when I found a photo album I’d never seen before. Mostly ordinary stuff, holidays, birthdays, mainly junk people keep to remind them of a similar time.

Then I saw one taken from my bedroom, nighttime. The flash caught the glass mid-reflection, behind my small hand pressed against the window, something stood in the garden.

Closer than I remembered, Its hand was raised. Not waving, touching the glass from the other side. My dad went quiet when he saw it, he didn’t laugh this time.

“We thought,” he said slowly, “that if we played along… if we let you wave… it wouldn’t try to come inside.”

I asked him why they never told me, he looked at me for a long moment.

“Because,” he said, “whatever it was… it stopped coming after you grew out of the habit.”

That night, for the first time in decades, I dreamed of my childhood window. I was standing on the floor, just like they’d made me. Outside, beyond the glass, something waited patiently. Its hand was raised, not practicing anymore.

Just waiting for me to remember what kept it there.
