**(contains rape and abuse)**

h made me the weird kid at school. My family used to bully me for it and used to hit me every time i used to talk to myself because my relatives always gossiped about my family behind our backs. My Family wanted to be normal but i wasn't making it possible it seems. I used to take tablets because it will so on so to "cure" my hallucinations but everyday I wake up with a scar or bruise. Whenever I forget to take my tablets, I saw figures similar to my parents watching me with a disgusting smirk which always scared and made me force myself the tablets. I turned 14 and I didn't get a birthday again as they forget. Whenever I grew up I used to get different tablets and I always wondered why my hallucinations never go away. I asked my parents and the usual response was "It is your fault for watching all horror films when you were young".

One day I was eating the low quality soup my school gives me and I see a message in my phone. It says that my family was leaving for 4 days and I couldn't come before I embarrass them infront of other people. It was normal for them to talk shit about me so I just turn off the phone, I am a A+ student because I want to make my money and get out of this household so i wasn't surprised at the teacher's remark about me. It was 8:00PM as I was watching my phone at 7% to get some entertainment but I forgot to take the tablets, One hour turns to 3 hours and I soon realize I forgot to take the tablets but something was strange....The figures weren't showing themselves anymore. I was finally relieved that it was over! the hallucinations! But after 4 days. My family came back with a smile but they turn their head to me and they frown. Their first question was "Did you get a A+ brat?". I nodded my head, not a word back. They leave upstairs as I shut myself in the room. In dinner, I said to my family. "Guys! My hallucinations aren't coming anymore" and my parents shift their eyes to each other in a bit eerie way. My Father slaps me, "You IDIOT! You forgot to take your tablets?!" And I raised my eyes in confusion. When did I mention that i didn't take the tablets. Before I could raise a question, They push them and throw their plates onto my hands forcing me to go to the kitchen.

This time, This night I didn't take the tablets thinking my hallucinations are gone forever. I take a recording of myself showing my happiness about how i lost my hallucinations but my parents barge into the room and take my phone away before i could stop recording. They threw my phone somewhere I couldn't see. They shouted at me saying to go to sleep which I did. The next morning, My private part started paining a lot. It was unbearable but I thought it was my period even though I got it in the first days of the month.  Figured it was twice in a month but I see few bruises on my thighs. I check that my tablets accidentally fell out of the bottle. Before I could grab it, I realized it having the word "HST" which means "Heavy Sleeping Tablet". I was confused, They were feeding me a sleeping tablet? They were always hiding and telling me not to check the tablet but swallow it right away. I quickly find my phone and check on it I opened the video to review my happiness, but the video continued and as the lights go off. I see my parents undressing me while I was asleep. Few men come inside and give money to them. They open a video camera and start raping me right at the spot and my parents smile at the money ignoring me.

**I suddenly open my shirt to see my belly growing a bit bigger.**
