I don’t know where I am anymore.

The walls… They’re breathing. 

I can hear it. I can feel it, like the house is pulsating. Tightening around me. The floor is soft beneath my feet, squelching like wet tissue every step I take. The air, thick and rancid, clings to me every room I go to. Every breath of air feels wrong, Heavy. It is suffocating.

I have no idea how much time has passed. Has it been days? Weeks? The days seem to blend together lately. 

The house..

Our house.

It doesn’t let time pass the way it should. It stretches everything out, Like the walls are shifting when I’m not looking. I try to find the front door, but I can’t remember where it is anymore. The house doesn’t want me to leave. The house wants me here.

It needs me here.

It needs me right in this room. I don’t know how I got here-how we got here. I didn’t believe in the supernatural, not really. I thought stories were just that – stories. But now I see, I understand. This house isn’t just old. It lives, and it needs to feed.

I try to get up, I try to move. My body doesn’t feel like it’s mine anymore. My legs are heavy, like they are made of stone. My arms – my hands – they’re not mine. I can feel them changing, twisting. It feels as though my joints are stretching - growing - the skin on my body thinning and cracking. The lesions on my arms are oozing, but there’s no blood anymore. It’s a dark, tarlike substance. God, it smells like rotting. Something ancient.

I’m looking at my hand as I type this, it’s different. It’s pale… Gaunt. The skin peeling. My fingernails too – no, now there’s just raw fingertip. It hurts. I can’t look at it for too long, I can’t think about it, or I’ll lose my mind.

I don’t know how this happened. I don’t understand it. I just know… It wasn’t like this before. Hannah wasn’t like this.

She wasn’t gone.

She was just sitting on the couch so still, so quiet. I thought she was sleeping. But now? I see her sometimes, out the corner of my eye. Her body is there, but it’s… wrong. Her face is warped, like something is stitching her into the fabric of the couch. The fabric isn’t just fabric anymore, It’s part of her… 

A part of us.

I can feel it inside me, pushing through my chest and curling in my throat, like something is crawling beneath my skin. I can hear it now too, it’s in my head. I don’t know if it’s the house or if it’s me losing myself, but I can hear the walls whispering. I don’t know what it’s saying. It seems so far away, so far inside, but it’s always there.

I don’t know where I end.
 
I am writing this for whoever might find this – If anyone reads this – if anyone comes across this thread, I hope it’s not too late. I don’t know how much time I have left, or even if I have any time left at all. My house… it’s changing us. Changing me. But maybe, just maybe if someone reads this, they’ll know what happened. 

Over the next few days I’ll post everything that’s happened

You’ll know what we became.

I just want to leave…

I don’t want to die.
