The hardest part about waiting was the emptiness. The kind of emptiness that envelops you, heavy and oppressive, where every second seems to stretch endlessly until hours feel like days. I sat next to Sarah in that sterile clinic waiting room, the faint hum of the air conditioning the only sound breaking the stillness. Sarah, my wife, sat beside me, her face pale, hands clasped tightly in her lap.

The strain of the last few years was etched into every line on her face, and her eyes carried the weight of every disappointment we’d faced. We had been trying for nearly three years to conceive. Three long years filled with tests, consultations, false hopes, and crushing letdowns. There had been times where we nearly gave up, where it seemed easier to accept the childless life that stretched before us.

But then, hope would rear its head again, stubborn and unrelenting, dragging us back into the endless cycle of anticipation and heartbreak. It was that hope, or maybe desperation, that had led us to Dr. Anton Gregor, a fertility specialist based in the outskirts of Boston. The clinic itself, tucked away in a quiet corner of the old financial district, was housed in a building that looked like it had been forgotten by time.

Red brick, ivy climbing up the walls, and narrow windows that reminded me of eyes. Eyes that watched but didn’t see. The building felt out of place amid the modern skyscrapers and bustling city life. It was an island, isolated and quiet, which seemed fitting, somehow. We felt like outsiders everywhere we went these days. We had heard of Dr. Gregor through a friend, a close friend who had been in a similar position to ours.

She had tried for years to conceive and had found success at this very clinic. When she first mentioned him, I remember feeling a flicker of hope, tempered by the kind of skepticism that comes after too many failures. “He’s not like the others,” she had said, leaning in with a kind of intensity that made me uncomfortable. “Dr. Gregor… he’s different. He doesn’t give up. He doesn’t fail.” The words had stuck with me.

We made an appointment, more out of desperation than belief, and here we were, sitting in that dim waiting room, waiting for our names to be called. Sarah shifted beside me, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her sleeve. I could feel her anxiety radiating off her in waves, and it mirrored my own. There was something unsettling about the place.

The door to the back of the clinic opened with a soft creak, and Dr. Gregor stepped into the room. He was tall, with graying hair that was neatly combed back, and he wore a pair of thin, wire-rimmed glasses that caught the light in strange ways. He smiled, a thin, professional smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, and gestured for us to follow him. The consultation room was just as outdated as the waiting area, with faded wallpaper and old wooden furniture that looked like it had been there for decades.

Dr. Gregor didn’t waste any time with pleasantries. He sat behind his desk, hands folded neatly in front of him, and asked us to explain our situation. “We’ve been trying for three years,” Sarah said, her voice small and tired. “We’ve tried everything. Medications, treatments, IVF. But nothing’s worked.” Dr. Gregor nodded, as though he had heard the story a thousand times before. “And now you’re here.” It wasn’t a question.

“We were told that you specialize in cases like ours,” I said, glancing at Sarah. “That you have ways of helping couples who’ve tried everything.” Dr. Gregor leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers as he regarded us with a cool, clinical gaze. “I do,” he said. “My methods are… unorthodox, but they have proven remarkably effective. I work with techniques that push the boundaries of what conventional medicine allows.”

He paused, as if weighing his next words carefully. “Of course, with such experimental methods, there are risks. But nothing that I believe outweighs the potential for success.” My pulse quickened. “Risks?” He waved a hand dismissively. “Every medical procedure comes with risks, Mr. …?” “Alex,” I said. “And this is Sarah.” “Well, Alex, the risks are mostly mild: discomfort, fatigue, nausea.”

“But in some cases, the pregnancy may trigger more… unusual reactions in the body. Nothing that can’t be managed with the proper care.” The way he said it made my skin crawl, but Sarah’s hand slipped into mine, squeezing tightly. She wanted this. We both did. We had come too far to turn back now. After a long moment of silence, I nodded. “What do we have to do?” Dr. Gregor smiled, but there was something about that smile.

Something that didn’t quite fit. “Just leave it to me.” We signed the papers. We agreed to the treatments. We put our faith in a man we barely knew, because what else could we do? Desperation has a way of clouding judgment. The treatments started immediately. It wasn’t like anything we had gone through before. The medications were different, the injections more intense. But Dr. Gregor assured us it was necessary.

And at first, it seemed to be working. Sarah’s body responded to the treatments faster than it ever had. Within weeks, she was pregnant. The first few months were a blur of joy and cautious optimism. For the first time in years, Sarah had a glow about her... a kind of quiet happiness that had been missing for so long. The nausea, the fatigue, all of it seemed like a small price to pay.

But as time went on, things began to change. It started with the rash. One morning, as I was getting ready for work, Sarah called me from the bedroom. Her voice had a strange tone to it: uncertain, worried. I rushed to her side, finding her standing in front of the mirror, her shirt pulled up to reveal her growing belly. At first, I didn’t see it. But then she turned slightly.

My heart skipped a beat. There, just beneath the skin, was a faint network of veins: dark, almost bluish veins that seemed to spider out from her navel. It looked like something out of a medical textbook: a picture of blood vessels that shouldn’t be visible, not like that. “It itches,” she said, her fingers hovering just above the skin, as if she didn’t want to touch it. I didn’t know what to say.

My mind raced with possible explanations. Stretch marks, pregnancy hormones, maybe even an allergic reaction. “It’s probably nothing,” I said, my voice sounding more confident than I felt. “But let’s call Dr. Gregor, just in case.” We called the clinic, and the nurse on the other end of the line sounded unconcerned. “It’s a normal side effect,” she said in a monotone voice, as though she had said it a hundred times before.

But it didn’t feel normal. Over the next few days, the veins grew darker, more pronounced. Sarah tried to ignore it, tried to stay positive, but I could see the worry creeping into her eyes. The rash spread slowly, crawling up her sides and around her back, until it looked like her entire torso was crisscrossed with dark lines. And the itching... she said the itching was unbearable.

Dr. Gregor assured us again that it was nothing. “Some patients experience more visible side effects than others,” he said. “It’s a reaction to the medication. It will pass.” But it didn’t pass. The symptoms only got worse. Sarah began to complain of sharp pains, stabbing pains that would come and go without warning.

They started in her abdomen but soon spread to her legs, arms, and even her chest. She would double over in agony, clutching her stomach, her face twisted in pain. There were nights when I would wake up to find her sitting on the edge of the bed, her hands pressed to her belly, her eyes wide and glassy. “It feels like something’s moving,” she whispered one night, her voice trembling with fear.

I tried to reassure her. I tried to tell her that it was normal for a baby to move around, but deep down, I felt the same growing fear. Something wasn’t right. I could feel it in my bones, in the pit of my stomach. But we were too far in. We had already committed. And every time I called the clinic, every time I tried to express my concerns, I was met with the same calm, detached responses.

One night, about five months into the pregnancy, Sarah woke me in a panic. I could hear her ragged breaths even before my eyes opened. When I sat up, I saw her standing in front of the full-length mirror on the far side of our room. The moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting long shadows across her body. But even in the dim light, I could see the changes happening to her.

Her belly was unnaturally large, far bigger than it should have been at five months. The veins beneath her skin, the ones that had started as a faint rash, were now prominent, thick like black cords crisscrossing her body. Her skin had taken on an almost translucent quality, and I could see the outline of something shifting beneath the surface. Her hands trembled as she touched her belly.

And for a moment, I thought I saw something, a ripple, like a shadow moving just beneath her skin. “Alex,” she whispered, her voice strained and on the verge of breaking, “it’s not just the baby. There’s something else. I can feel it. It’s moving differently. It doesn’t feel right.”

I got out of bed, my heart hammering in my chest. Every rational part of me wanted to tell her that she was imagining things. That the stress and hormones were playing tricks on her mind. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling that something was terribly, horribly wrong. I walked over to her, wrapping my arms around her shoulders as she trembled. Her skin was cold to the touch, clammy with sweat. “We’ll go to the clinic tomorrow,” I said, my voice barely more than a whisper. “We’ll make them do something.”

She nodded, her body stiff against mine, but I could feel the doubt in her, the same doubt that had been growing inside me for weeks. What could we do? We had signed the papers, agreed to the treatments, and put our faith in Dr. Gregor. That night, I didn’t sleep. I sat in bed, listening to Sarah’s shallow breathing as she lay beside me, her hand resting protectively over her swollen belly.

The next day, we went back to the clinic. I had called ahead, demanding an immediate appointment, refusing to take no for an answer. Sarah was in too much pain to protest, her body visibly deteriorating with each passing hour. When we arrived at the clinic, Dr. Gregor was waiting for us, his calm, controlled demeanor as unnerving as ever.

He ushered us into a private examination room, the kind that smelled of antiseptic and cold metal. The room was too quiet, the kind of quiet that makes your ears ring and your heart race. “We’re going to run some tests,” Dr. Gregor said, his voice smooth and clinical. “I assure you, everything is progressing as expected.” I couldn’t take it anymore. The anger that had been building inside me boiled over.

“EXPECTED?!!” I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. “LOOK AT HER! THIS IS NOT NORMAL! SHE'S IN PAIN, SHE'S DYING!” Dr. Gregor remained unflinching, his eyes fixed on me with an eerie calm. “I understand your concern, Mr. Alex. But I assure you, everything is under control.” “No,” I said, shaking my head. “It’s not. You’ve been lying to us. You’ve been hiding things from us.”

“I want the truth. Now.” For the first time, something shifted in Dr. Gregor’s expression. It was subtle, a flicker of something dark in his eyes, a tightening of his lips. He glanced at Sarah, who was now lying on the examination table, her breath coming in shallow gasps, before turning his attention back to me. “There are things you don’t understand,” he said slowly, choosing his words carefully.

“The treatment you agreed to, it’s not just about fertility. It’s about evolution. Progress.” I felt a chill crawl down my spine. “What are you talking about?” Dr. Gregor took a step closer to me, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “We are on the cusp of something incredible, Mr. Alex. Something that will change the very fabric of humanity. Your child, Sarah’s child, is the first step in that process.”

I stared at him, my mind struggling to comprehend what he was saying. “YOU'RE EXPERIMENTING ON US?!” He didn’t deny it. Instead, he smiled, a cold, calculated smile that made my blood run cold. “Your child is not just a child, Mr. Alex. It is a breakthrough. A new form of life. Something beyond what we currently understand.” I couldn’t breathe. My chest tightened, my heart pounding in my ears.

“You’re insane,” I said. “You’ve put something inside her, something that isn’t human.” Dr. Gregor’s smile widened. “Not yet. But it will be.” Before I could react, the door to the examination room opened, and two nurses entered, their faces blank, expressionless. They moved toward Sarah, who was too weak to resist, and began preparing her for some kind of procedure. “No,” I shouted, rushing toward the table.

“Don’t touch her!” One of the nurses grabbed my arm, her grip surprisingly strong. “Sir, please step back.” I struggled, trying to pull away, but the nurse’s grip tightened. “Let me go!” I shouted, panic rising in my throat. Dr. Gregor watched calmly from the corner of the room, his hands folded behind his back. “You need to trust me, Mr. Alex. Everything I’m doing is for the greater good.”

“Greater good?” I spat, my voice trembling with rage. “You’re killing her!” Before I could say anything else, I felt a sharp prick in my arm. One of the nurses had injected me with something, something that made the world blur around the edges, my limbs growing heavy and sluggish.

I tried to fight it, tried to keep my eyes open, but the darkness swallowed me whole. When I woke up, the room was dim, and my body felt like it had been submerged in molasses. I could hear the soft beeping of machines, the sterile hum of medical equipment, but I couldn’t move.

Slowly, as my vision cleared, I realized I was strapped to a chair, my wrists and ankles bound with thick leather straps. Panic surged through me, but I couldn’t do anything, I could barely even speak. Across the room, Sarah lay on the examination table, her eyes closed, her chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. The veins beneath her skin had darkened even further.

Her belly had swollen even more, grotesquely large, as if something inside her was pushing its way out. Dr. Gregor stood beside her, watching her with the cold, detached gaze of a scientist observing his experiment. The nurses were gone, and the room felt eerily quiet, save for the faint beeping of the machines monitoring Sarah’s vital signs.

“She’s nearing the final stage,” Dr. Gregor said softly, almost to himself. “It’s almost time.” “Time for what?” I managed to croak, my voice weak and hoarse. Dr. Gregor glanced at me, raising an eyebrow. “For the birth, of course. The culmination of all my work. Your child will be the first of many, Mr. Alex. The beginning of a new era.” I struggled against the restraints, my muscles straining, but I was too weak.

“You can’t do this,” I gasped. “You’re playing god, and you’re going to kill her!” “She’s a vessel,” Dr. Gregor said simply, as if that explained everything. “A means to an end. Sarah understood that, even if she didn’t realize it.” My vision blurred again, tears of rage and helplessness clouding my eyes. I had been a fool to trust him, a fool to believe in his promises. I had brought Sarah here, and now I was watching her die.

Suddenly, Sarah’s body convulsed, her back arching off the table as a guttural scream tore from her throat. The machines around her beeped frantically, the monitors flashing with erratic readings. Dr. Gregor moved quickly, checking the machines, his movements calm and methodical, as if he had been expecting this.“It’s happening.” he said, sounding pleased. I watched in horror as Sarah’s belly bulged unnaturally.

The skin stretching and distorting as something moved beneath it, something large, something alive. Her screams filled the room, echoing off the walls, and I felt a sickening sense of helplessness wash over me. “Please, stop it...” I said, my voice breaking. Dr. Gregor didn’t even look at me. His focus remained on Sarah, on the grotesque transformation happening before our eyes.

Suddenly, Sarah's convulsions stopped. The room fell eerily silent. Save for the faint beeping of the machines. Her body lay still on the table, her chest barely rising and falling, her once-glowing skin now deathly pale. For a moment, I thought she was gone, that whatever horror had taken hold of her had finally consumed her. But then, I saw it. A movement, slow at first, but unmistakable. Her belly rippled, the skin stretching unnaturally and then something pressed against it from the inside.

I could see every detail, the shape of fingers, of an arm, of something far too large to be human. My breath caught in my throat. I realized that this thing was coming. It was coming now. Dr. Gregor stepped forward, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of excitement and awe. "This is it," he whispered, as if he were witnessing a miracle. "The birth of the future."

Sarah’s body twitched, her back arching once more. And then, with a sickening wet sound, her belly split open. From the torn flesh of her abdomen, something emerged. At first, it was difficult to make out, slick with blood, its limbs twisting in unnatural ways as it pulled itself free from Sarah's body. But as it fully emerged, standing in the dim light of the examination room, I could see it clearly.

It was a child... at least, it had the shape of one. But it was wrong, horribly, grotesquely wrong. Its limbs were elongated, too thin and too long, its skin an unnatural shade of pale gray. Its eyes, those eyes, were black, bottomless pits, too large for its face, like dark voids that seemed to swallow the light around them. The veins that had covered Sarah's body were etched into its skin, pulsing with a faint, sickly glow.

The thing...my child, if I could even call it that, stumbled forward, dripping with blood, its movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet being yanked on invisible strings. It opened its mouth, but no sound came out. Instead, it stared at me, its dark eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that made my skin crawl. I felt like I was drowning in that gaze, like it was reaching into my soul, pulling at the deepest parts of me.

Dr. Gregor moved toward it, his hands outstretched, as if to welcome it. "Magnificent," he breathed, his voice trembling with reverence. "You see, Mr. Alex? This is the future. This is evolution. A new kind of life, one that will surpass humanity."

"Your child is the first of its kind." I wanted to scream, to rage against him, to demand answers. But all I could do was stare, my mind struggling to comprehend what was happening. This thing, this abomination, wasn’t my child. It couldn’t be. This wasn’t what we had wanted. This wasn’t what we had signed up for. But it was too late. Far too late.

And then, the creature did something that sent ice-cold fear shooting through my veins. It smiled. Not a human smile. Not the smile of a newborn child. But something far more sinister, far more knowing. It tilted its head to the side, studying me, and then, with a slow, deliberate movement, it turned its attention to Sarah’s lifeless body. Its black eyes flickered with a strange light as it reached down, its elongated fingers brushing against her still form. “No,” I croaked, my voice weak and hoarse.

“Get away from her.” Dr. Gregor ignored me, his focus entirely on the creature. “There’s more to be done,” he murmured, almost to himself. “So much more to be discovered.”

I don’t remember much after that. The drugs they had injected into me must have finally taken full effect, because the next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. The room was white and sterile, and the hum of machines was the only sound I could hear. I sat up, my head pounding, my body aching. Sarah was gone. I knew that without even asking. The child, the creature, it was gone too.

But the memory of that night, of what I had seen, was burned into my mind. Dr. Gregor and the clinic...it had all disappeared. When I asked the nurses, the doctors, they looked at me like I was insane. They said I had been found unconscious in our apartment, alone, with no sign of Sarah. They said there was no clinic, no Dr. Gregor. No record of any fertility treatments. It was as if none of it had ever happened.

But I knew the truth. I knew what I had seen. I knew what had been done to us. The months that followed were a blur. I tried to find answers, tried to trace the clinic, but every lead went cold. It was as if the entire place had been wiped from existence. I couldn’t find any of the staff, any records, nothing. It was as though we had been part of some secret, underground experiment, and now, the evidence had been erased.

I moved away from Boston. I couldn’t stay there, not after everything. But even now, as I sit in this new apartment, far away from the city, I can’t escape the nightmares.

I see Sarah every night, her body convulsing on that table, her eyes wide with terror. And I see it, that thing that had come from her, that thing that wasn’t human.

But the worst part, the part that haunts me the most, is that I know it’s still out there. Somewhere, that creature, my child, is walking the earth, growing, learning, evolving. And I can’t help but wonder what Dr. Gregor meant when he said it was just the beginning. What other horrors has he unleashed? What other experiments is he conducting, in secret, in the shadows? I don't think I will ever [know](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).
