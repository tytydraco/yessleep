I mean this in a literal sense. My family are all clairvoyants. We see the future through our dreams. It started when my grandmother started seeing my mother's pregnancies through dreams, then my mother predicted mine, and I can also see big events in my dreams. I'm 20 and have been like this since I was 12, all of my dreams predict something, or I simply do not dream. That's why my most recent dream confused me so much.

*"Baby?" I heard my fiance call to me from the other side of the theater lobby. But how is that possible, he's standing right next to me? I hear his voice again.*

*"Sweetheart, it's me, turn around."* 

*I turn around and see no one there. My fiance standing next to me looks at me.*

"*Honey are you alright?" I nod. We enter the screening room and I see my fiance at the end of the aisle. I looked next to me and saw him there, too. What? Why are there two of him? I hold his arm tightly and walk toward the other one.*

"Ariana, are you okay?" my fiance asked as he shook me awake.

"I'm fine." I lied. "Just a strange dream is all." Brad didn't know that I could see the future. 

"Oh okay, don't forget we're going to the movies for date night tonight. Your mom is watching Ally, right?" I simply nodded as my stomach dropped. What's going to happen at the movies?

My stomach has been in knots all day, and it only worsened as we walked into the theater. I clung to Brad's side the whole walk to the concession stand. Then, like I was reliving the dream again, I heard his voice call out to me. This time I didn't hesitate and I turned around the first time, once again only to see nothing and no one there. My blood ran cold as I felt someone breathing down my back.

"You broke the rules, girl," the voice said. The same voice as Brad. I felt a sharp pain down my back. 

*Fuck, we need to leave,* I thought as I clutched Brad's hand tighter. I have to let this play out exactly like my dream. No matter how terrified I am to approach that thing pretending to be my fiance. We walked into the screening room just like we did in my dream, and there he was. The fake Brad. I clutched the real Brad's hand and started walking to the fake one. 

The Brad I was holding onto started slowing down, and when I turned around, he was frozen in fear. I turned back to the fake Brad as his face began to distort, revealing a snake-like tongue and razor sharp teeth. I pulled on the real Brad's hand as I started backing away. 

"We need to run, now," I whispered.

"You fools," the fake Brad, that doesn't even resemble him anymore, cackled. "You think you can escape me? I'll follow you into your dreams, again and again. You can't cheat death himself!"

Now I knew we were even more fucked than I thought we were before. Something awakened it, and now we're dealing with the devil. We ducked behind a row of seats and started making our way to the other exit, the devil not yet following.

"How did this happen?!" Brad whisper-yelled at me.

"I don't know! My mom studies witchcraft but- oh no there it is. My mom accidentally summoned Satan."

"Come out, mortals, I just need your souls- To bring back to the one who summoned me," Satan roared.

"WAIT!" I yelled as I popped up from behind the seat. "I know who summoned you, you don't need our souls to find her."

"Ari what the fuck are you doing?? She has our daughter!" Brad said.

"I know, I have a plan," I responded before looking Satan in the eyes. "I will take you to the one who summoned you if you let us and my daughter go."

"Think of the location, and we'll be there." Satan told me. I gripped Brad's hand as I envisioned my mother's living room.

With a flash and two seconds, we were there. I went to my mother's room and picked up my sleeping baby.

"Are we free to go now?" I asked. Before he could answer, a golden spike was driven through his chest. As Satan's now lifeless body slumped to the ground, I looked at my mother, who was holding the spike.

"You're safe now, all the fallen angels have returned to paradise and Satan is dead," my mom said as she dropped the spike. "Gold and Holy water. Grandma's spellbooks were never wrong."

Brad stared at us, slackjawed. "What. The. Fuck. Did you just stab SATAN?"

"I think she also killed him, but Ally is safe." Now my whole family is safe.

Brad and Ally will never have to worry about being harmed again.
