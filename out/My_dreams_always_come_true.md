I hate myself for it. I watch what happens in my dream occur, and I can’t do anything about it.

Many times I have dreamed about people dying — and I have to watch it happen.  
I pray to dear God that I don’t dream every night before going to sleep, but I get ignored every time.

There have been some nights when I don’t dream,  
but then I dream **twice** the next time I sleep.  
And those dreams are always about people passing away.

I try not to sleep when that happens.  
Once I tried keeping myself awake by drinking an almost lethal amount of coffee.  
I dreamed **five times** the next time I slept after that.

I have watched people getting murdered in front of my eyes.  
I have watched animals dying in front of my eyes.  
I have watched people I love dying in front of my eyes.

Just because I dreamed.

I blame myself and hold a knife pointed at my throat,  
just to drop it and start blaming myself again.

It is currently 1 in the morning,  
and I am once again scared to sleep.

One part of my brain wishes not to dream,  
but the other part begs to dream.  
I know what will happen if I don’t.

I am sitting in my chair with my whole body shaking.  
I must lie on the bed and close my eyes.

I cannot do it.  
I can’t, but I—

I get up, lie down on the bed, and put pillows all around me.  
I sleep with a knife.  
In a case, obviously, so I don’t cut myself while sleeping.

It’s a sharp knife.  
The brand claims it is sharp enough to cut through a rope in just one light swing.  
I never tested it though.  
I keep ropes away from me.  
I get bad thoughts.

>

I close my eyes and I am suddenly lost in thought.  
I think about the time I used to have normal dreams.  
Happy dreams — sometimes sad.

>

I think about when it started.  
These dreams.  
Always negative.  
Never positive.

I can’t remember anything as always.  
I think about nothing for a while.  
I am thinking about something but I feel like I am not.  
I am not.  
I—

I forgot to tell you.  
These dreams of mine. Are. Always. **Lucid.**

I know I am dreaming right now as one of my fingers is missing.  
An extremely common way to differentiate between reality and dreams —  
just see if y—

>

I feel dead.  
My eyes lock on my finger.  
My index finger.

It’s not missing.  
It’s not missing.  
It’s not missing—  
it’s not there.

>

My mouth is too dry to scream.  
My legs are shaking on their own and I am unconsciously biting my tongue.

My index finger has been cut off.  
No. No. **NO.**

It doesn’t take me any more time to realize.  
This dream is not about someone else.  
It’s about **me.**

I cannot move.  
I have my knife with me.  
It is already taken out of its case.

I look around in the void but see my watch.  
The time is **2:55 in the morning.**

The pain of fear beats the pain of my finger.  
Eventually, I start feeling both.

I cut my tongue hard.  
Blood fills my mouth and wets it.  
I scream. I scream—  
no voice comes out.

I cannot speak.  
I wish the dream is about me accidentally cutting off my finger with my knife.  
Yes. Great.  
It is my left hand anyway.  
It doesn’t matter at all be—

A knife.  
Its sharp edge pointed at the top of my head.

I close my eyes.  
A person breathes heavily.

I’m gonna wake up any second now.  
Any seco—

But that means something bad will happen.

If my dream ends right now, it will mean that.. I am dead.

I feel the knife lift—  
but I feel the pain in my throat.

I wake up.  
I am extremely sweaty.  
My clock says it is **2:55 in the morning.**

I get out of my bed.  
I know what is about to happen.

I look at my finger.  
It is not there.

I don’t try to scream,  
but I eventually do.

The try doesn’t do anything,  
but I still had to try.

Me screaming would startle the person who is about to take my life.  
Everything goes according to what happened in my dream.

Me biting my tongue,  
blood being filled in my mouth.  
My head hurts.

I am thinking what I thought in my dream — and this — at the same time.

Knife on the top of my head.  
I close my eyes as in my dream.

Same heavy breathing.  
I realize that’s **me.**

I am too scared.  
I might die from fear.

I don’t think about waking up.  
This is reality.  
I know it.

The knife lifts up.  
It’s going to come down with force any second now.

It is going to kill me.  
I am about to die.

Is that a good thing?  
I will never have dreams again.

No more people will die.  
No more animals will die.  
No more accidents will happen.

Because of **me.**

I fall on the ground.  
My knife passed through.

I think for five seconds more —  
enough to realize the situation.

I think if everything was a coincidence the whole time,  
or real.

**I see the long hand of the clock move backwards and forward.**

>(**twice**)
