&#x200B;

The train’s wheels squealed to a stop, locking up with a deep exhalation of breath. The fungal smell from the pink flesh and black veins spiderwebbing across the walls increased abruptly. I felt the train rapidly decelerating under our feet.  
  
Through the blur of motion outside the mucus-streaked windows, I saw a system of glowing, blood-red roads winding their way hundreds of stories up into the sky on thin stilts. Other roads tunneled deep into the ground. Constant traffic of what looked like giant, egg-shaped pods traveled across them in a blur.   
  
Thousands of the windowless silver towers loomed on the horizon. Behind them, a few enormous ships that looked almost like dragonflies flew up into the coldness of space, while others descended, falling down from the bright chips of starlight with a fluttering of opalescent wings.   
  
The wings stretched out hundreds of feet in both directions, as narrow as glass and filled with throbbing blood vessels under the translucent, shimmering skin. Like the aliens of the Collective Mind themselves and the train we traveled on, these dragonfly ships looked like some mesh of machine and flesh.   
  
From the tails of those ascending came gouts of blue flames, as if they were space shuttles on their way to the Moon. Like some sort of blimp, the alien ships had carriages made of a glossy, obsidian-like material connected to their chests where I figured the passengers or cargo of this strange alien civilization must travel.  
  
I saw the glittering of metal combined with fine, translucent veins on these enormous things. I wondered if perhaps the Collective Mind had even created the living train called the X77 in the first place using the same kind of technology.   
  
If they had, they were advanced far beyond anything I had imagined. Humanity would stand absolutely no chance against such a species. I shuddered to think of what would happen if they reached Earth and found a world full of new subjects to dissect and conduct their horrific experiments on, before ultimately exterminating the whole species like an infestation of bugs, just like they had done on Brother’s planet.  
  
I didn’t get to wonder about it for long when the doors at the end of the carriages opened with a whirring of gears. At the same time, the train came to an abrupt stop, its doors pulling apart, the black veins disappearing like dark dust in the frigid air of the Shadow Plains. Behind us, Cook continuously moaned in agony, his destroyed body smelling like napalm and burnt hair.  
  
“Run,” Cook cried in a croaking whisper. “Justin, you and Brother need to get away…”  
  
At that moment, the hunters of the Collective Mind oozed over the thresholds like alien centipedes, the many electronic components built into their bodies whirring and whining. Their countless unblinking eyes scanned us and the dead body of their comrade with a look of impassion.   
  
Brother did not hesitate when he saw the enemy. He pulled my arm and yanked me out the door. As we sprinted away, he turned, firing a blast of lava at the closer of the two hunters. I glanced back, seeing it land on the abomination’s black flesh with a sizzling sound and a dripping of fat. It gave a shrill, banshee-like wail, which was answered all up and down the living train a few moments later by countless other hunters.  
  
Brother’s plan worked. Both of the hunters from the Collective Mind slithered out of the train in a blur after us, leaving the burnt, moaning form of Cook propped up against the fleshy wall. His eyes looked glazed, as if he didn’t even know where he was or what was happening. He was seriously injured, and I wasn’t sure if he would make it back in the shape he was in.  
  
We sprinted out onto a road that looked like it was paved with some red volcanic glass. It split off into dozens of smaller branching paths that tunneled into the ground, deep under the screaming of the grass and the spiraling black hole of the sky.  
  
The hunters moved at a superhuman speed as Brother chose one path at random. I heard them behind us, their wet, slimy bodies giving off gurgling breaths. They rapidly closed the distance.  
  
The red path narrowed into a tunnel only wide enough for Brother and I to run in single-file. Brother abruptly stopped, motioning me forward.  
  
“Keep running,” he said, turning to fire another round at the hunters. To my horror, I saw they were less than twenty feet behind us now. At this rate, they would catch up with us in seconds.  
  
The black smoke belched from the end of the obsidian rifle as he sprayed another blast of lava at the closer of the two hunters, the one with a mass of still-smoking, burnt flesh on the front of its tree-like trunk. It saw Brother with its many lidless eyes and gave a wail of surprise. Its hundreds of long, skittering legs pushed it up into the air. Its blue wires suddenly shone with an explosion of light. More of its cobalt-blue napalm shot out of sizzling holes that opened up like screaming mouths all up and down the wires spiraling around its body.   
  
Brother’s fiery round sprayed the hunter behind it, covering the front of its legs. It fell forward with a wail as its legs melted, the flesh ripping open under the tremendous heat.  
  
The nearer of the hunter’s spray hit Brother in the arm. He stumbled back, following after me with a grim set expression. His stony face showed no signs of pain even as I heard his skin sizzle like bacon and give off thin wisps of gray smoke.   
  
“Go!” he yelled, pointing forward into the darkness and the unknown. Without hesitation, I sprinted ahead- my body sore and exhausted, my arm still gouged from the bullet wound I had gotten when I was first chased on the train, countless burn spots eaten into my skin. And yet, I knew I was incredibly lucky to even still be alive.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The tunnel quickly sloped down like the trail of a mountain, the road hanging over the massive chamber of dark, empty space that opened up for hundreds of stories beneath us. The alien hunter in front still trailed closely behind us. It gave its eerie banshee shriek. I heard responses from all around us in the darkness, including not far ahead up on the floating crimson road.  
  
Brother glanced backward and forward with a grim expression in his colorless eyes. I saw we were trapped, surrounded on all sides. They would either burn us alive right here and now or take us to some cold alien laboratory where they would dissect and torture us like medical experiments in some death camp.  
  
“Do you trust me?” Brother murmured in a barely audible voice, grabbing my arm with a grip like iron. I nodded. Before I knew what was happening, he pushed me over the edge of the road. I fell back, my arms windmilling, a silent scream suffocating in my throat. Still holding onto my arm, Brother jumped over the edge after me just as the hunters of the Collective Mind reached us.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
As we fell through what felt like eternal space, I felt a blind animal panic take over, exterminating all rational thought. I saw there was a city thrumming and vibrating thousands of feet beneath us, the place the train had called Sugguroth. Great towers shaped like spiraling blades made of glossy black and red volcanic glass loomed thousands of stories, their many circling windows giving off a pale, white glow. My mind wouldn’t register what I saw until later, however, when I looked back with a more dispassionate and less terrified eye.  
  
Clusters of hunters from the Collective Mind were gathered in circles. Hundreds of the black, writhing creatures huddled tightly together in groups, screaming up at the dark stone sky in harmonizing shrieks. Artificial lights gave off a white radiance that shone across the seemingly endless cavern.  
  
Soft fungal root systems wound their way through the air like spiderwebs, each glowing with a pale silver like moonlight. The air whipped crazily all around us. I looked down, realizing we were falling right into the web of roots. Before I knew what was happening, they were all around me like narrow tree branches, grabbing at my body.  
  
I felt a scream sucked out of my lungs as we tumbled through the thin strands that reached out and caught us like grasping hands. The narrow roots slowed our descent. We fell into tangles and knots, breaking through one layer after another until we finally found ourselves stopped. Like flies in a spiderweb, we were trapped thousands of feet above the ground.  
  
My heart slammed over and over in my chest, the rapid beat ringing in my ears. I had thought I was dead. The sheer animal terror of falling still shook me to my core. Trembling and weak, I could only lay there on the fungal roots, hyperventilating and praying. I looked down at Sugguroth far below us, my stomach flipping with vertigo.  
  
Brother and I were caught in the filaments as if they were tightly-wound strings of rope on some nightmarish rope course. Except I doubted that any rope course would have a drop of hundreds of stories onto the flashing, strobing city of the Collective Mind.  
  
“We need… to get back…” Brother gasped next to me, looking more shaken than I had ever seen him. He gulped hard, looking around, as if expecting to see another vision from a nightmare perched overhead. Yet, as far as I could tell, we were safe for the moment- as long as the roots didn’t give out and cause us to plummet to our deaths. I gazed at him in amazement.  
  
“Back?” I asked, confused and stuttering. I tried not to look down for too long, otherwise everything started spinning. “To… the train?” He nodded grimly.  
  
“The X77 only stops here for about an hour,” Brother said, his ticking, golden pocket-watch flashing in his hands for a brief moment. It was the one with twenty-five hours on it that I had seen on the train. “It isn’t like the Boglands where it must regenerate its energy. I’ve seen the hunters from the Collective Mind loading up cargo and supplies on the X77 train, which is probably the only reason it stops for as long as it does. I don’t know where the cargo goes, but thankfully, the train stops here longer than it does in the other worlds, like Naraka or Victoriat.”  
  
“So what do you propose?” I hissed through gritted teeth, looking around at the empty space that surrounded us all on sides. “Do you want to just fly away? Because, as far as I can tell, we’re stuck.” I looked around grimly, seeing the bottom of the crimson road hundreds of feet overhead. It was so smooth and glass-like that I could see a reflection in it. Everything in its reflection became red like blood, as if it were a mirror that showed the absolute reality of death and murder all over the universe.  
  
“I have something here,” Brother murmured. He frantically brought his small, leather satchel he always wore between us and reached inside. Brother’s eyes flicked constantly, glancing up at our torturers on the crimson road and down at the city of Sugguroth far below.   
  
“What are you looking for?” I asked, still feeling sick from my fear of heights. If I kept my gaze fixed on Brother and kept him talking, I didn’t notice the endless drop beneath my feet so much. It was like standing on the edge of a skyscraper at night and looking down 100 stories at the flowing traffic below with a shrill wind whipping all around me. Brother didn’t respond, however. The look of intense concentration remained plastered across his thin, aristocratic visage.  
  
The many lidless eyes of hunters gazed down at us from the road overhead. Even though everything about them seemed alien, I could have sworn I saw an expression of hunger reflected in their eldritch faces. The granite walls of this subterranean city stretched for miles in every direction, as smooth and free of handholds as smooth glass. I knew we would not be getting up that way.  
  
Brother’s hand came up with two coiled lengths of rope. The rope looked like something futuristic. It looked as yellow as gold and shimmered like metal. He carefully handed one over to me.  
  
“These creatures exist primarily as a hive mind. What one sees and thinks, the others can all gain access to. The entire city will be looking for us soon,” Brother said. “All of the hunters can access the memories of their comrades, even the dead ones. Within their bodies, they have something that records everything.   
  
“We need to find a way back to the train and get out of the Shadow Plains before the hunters all organize. We need to start climbing somehow.” My stomach dropped at the thought. Climbing an unsecured rope of some unknown material with no safety harness three or four thousand feet above the ground seemed like something from a nightmare. I felt the sudden urge to retch just thinking about it.  
  
“No, absolutely not,” I said, breathing faster. My vision seemed to turn white with anxiety. “I am not doing that. No fucking way. I hate heights.” Brother looked coldly over at me.  
  
“Then you can stay here forever,” he said, a flash of amusement coming over his eyes. “It will be a fitting death for someone afraid of heights, yes? You can just starve and dehydrate over here by yourself, or wait for someone from the Collective Mind to come grab you…”  
  
As if the universe had heard Brother’s words, I heard a dissonant, whirring sound far below. It sounded almost like a helicopter, with a kind of rhythmic whooping that faded and grew in cycles of a couple seconds. I had no idea what I was hearing at first, but the shard of dread that pierced my heart told me it was nothing good.  
  
 I looked down, seeing one of the alien dragonfly ships soaring straight up towards us. Gouts of blue flame shot from its tail as countless fans whirred inside its body.  Like the hunters of the Collective Mind, these dragonflies had both organic and machine parts. On its torso, I saw a black, obsidian box fused into its skin. A slit in the box covered with some sort of tinted glass allowed me to see what lay inside.  
  
Hundreds of eyes on stalks stared up at me and Brother from the box without any shred of emotion. The dragonfly flew up at us with a predatory hunger in its dragon-like face. Its eyes looked as pale as cataracts, opaque and filmy, the white gleam looking as pale as moonlight. Its wings looked as light and fragile as a thin pane of glass, translucent and filled with throbbing rivers of red and blue vessels.  
  
The dragonfly’s long, tapering mouth opened with a cry like a tornado siren. I felt my heart drop as I stared down at the approaching messenger of death.   
  
For now, my fear of heights was forgotten. A new fear, far more sharp and urgent, stabbed its way through my heart.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
“This is our only chance,” Brother said without a hint of fear. He took his rope, tying the end into a large lasso. I didn’t understand how he stayed so calm. I was so filled with mortal terror that I could barely remember how to speak. “Get your rope ready, dammit!”   
  
I jumped, looking down at the rope. With shaking hands, I grabbed it, following Brother’s lead and tying a large lasso in the end. I triple-knotted it, not knowing what his plan was but figuring that our lives depended on it.  
  
The dragonfly was only a couple hundred feet below us by this point. It would reach us in seconds. Its wings battered the air furiously as it ascended, showing off thousands of protruding, needle-like teeth in its reptilian mouth. Brother took me by the arm with a grip like iron.  
  
“This is our only chance,” he hissed. “Get ready!” With his rifle slung around one shoulder, he took his rope and began swinging it in circles, gaining momentum for the lasso. I did the same, but I had no experience with rope or lassoing livestock. I wasn’t a cowboy, after all.  
  
Time moved so fast, though, that I never got the chance to question it. Before I knew it, Brother had flung his rope. The steam-whistle cry of the cybernetically-enhanced predator roared from directly below us as it blurred through the spiderwebbing of thick fungal roots growing out of the smooth granite. The roots dissolved into a cloud of spores and dust beneath us, and suddenly, there was nothing between me and the ground except cold, empty air.  
  
A moment after Brother, I threw my lasso at the creature- and prayed.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
My lasso did not land anywhere close to the massive alien dragonfly. I heard a deep booming chortle from the creature, as if it were trying to laugh. And then I felt myself falling as the last of the roots dissolved under the dragonfly’s attack.  
  
I screamed, knowing I had lost. In that moment, I knew I would die. I could only look down at my fate as everything inside my chest squirmed and rose like pure, distilled anxiety. My feet tingled as if butterflies flew underneath the soles.  
  
A hand came down and grabbed my arm with a grip like iron. I couldn’t look away from the drop, however.  
  
“Help me, you fool!” Brother screamed. I looked up as he started to pull up, the grip he had on my arm slipping. I began to slide back down. With a wave of adrenaline I have never felt before, I reached and hugged his body with every ounce of strength I had. Then we were rising into the air at a tremendous speed. I clung to Brother’s body, but felt myself slipping. My sweaty palms could barely support me. I tried grabbing his waist, but we were moving up so fast that I felt myself slip down a couple more inches. Frantic, I dug my fingers into the cloth of his poncho, hoping the material would not rip and send me falling to my death.  
  
I glimpsed the rope Brother had thrown caught around the alien’s dragon-like snout. The creature shook its head like a dog with a toy, trying to throw us off. I watched in horror as its mouth opened, the rope snapping apart with a popping sound.  
  
Then both Brother and I were falling. I was screaming. Brother’s eyes had rolled up in his head and gone white. Everything was moving so fast that I wasn’t even sure where I was anymore. I only knew we had failed.  
  
A moment later, my body hit something hard. I rolled, feeling something in my left shoulder give way with a crack. The breath was knocked out of my lungs as I shrieked in agony.  
  
Brother was suddenly standing over, pulling me up. Blood streamed from a gash on his forehead as he pointed below us.  
  
“We did it!” he told me excitedly. “We landed on one of the roads. The train will be leaving soon. We need to get back immediately.” Still stunned, I barely comprehended the words. Brother knelt down and slapped me hard across the face. “Get up! Run! Do you want to stay here forever?” Groggily, I rose to my feet and followed Brother out into the cold blackness and screaming grass of the Collective Mind.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
We sprinted down the bloody glow of the smooth alien road. The train in the distance still had its doors opened. I realized with some slight amusement that we had returned to almost the same exact spot we had left from. As we got closer, I could even see the burnt, blackened body of Jeremiah laying still and cold on the blood-strewn floor.  
  
“Next stop: St. Joseph’s Stand, England. We will reach our destination in approximately seven hours,” the train gurgled in its low hiss of a voice. The words echoed through the cold, dry air of the Shadow Plains all around us.  
  
To my horror, I saw Cook missing from the carriage. Where he had been sitting, I saw a puddle of gore and a warhammer covered in blood and pieces of skin. Ruby-red drops led out the door like breadcrumbs, smeared across the floor of the train as if something had dragged him away. Bloody handprints covered the wall and door.  
  
I could almost see what had happened in my mind’s eye: Cook trying frantically to keep his attacker away with the meager warhammer, his injured, withdrawing body filled with terror and pain. The hunter from the Collective Mind wrapping one of its slithering, snake-like tentacle legs around Cook’s leg and dragging him away. But to where? To the horrors of the dissection chamber deep in the supermassive skyscrapers of Sugguroth?  
  
 In the end, I would never find out. In hindsight, I realize that was probably for the best.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Finally, mercifully, the doors of the train closed. The living train slowly gained speed, heading towards it next destination in its never-ending circuit across the multiverse.   
  
We took off across the dark wasteland of the Shadow Plains with the screaming of the dull, jet-black Katcha grass surrounding us like the shrieking of an erupting volcano. Brother turned to me, his eyes cold and distant, his lips tightly pressed together. Sighing deeply, he slung his rifle around his body and patted me on the shoulder.  
  
“I’m sorry, Justin,” Brother said, a genuine expression twisting his face for the briefest fraction of a second. “I’m sorry about your friend.”  
  
“Do you think the Collective Mind is experimenting on him?” I asked, horrified. “What if they use what they learn from experimenting on Cook to attack Earth?” Brother just shook his head.  
  
“We can’t change that now,” he responded grimly. “All you can do is prepare yourself for whatever may come.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
After we had escaped the Shadow Plains of the Collective Mind and the hunters from the House of the Blades, the danger on the train seemed much less. Brother and I were the sole survivors, and while we had to watch our backs due to the plethora of strange and often hungry alien creatures inhabiting the train, we saw no more hunters from the Collective Mind after that. We didn’t end up having to kill more than a couple dozen monstrous creatures on the train in the next few weeks, a number which Brother seemed to find dull and underwhelming. He lived on the thrill of the hunt, after all, which was something I found out more and more as I got to know him.  
  
We passed through many more worlds, living on the water of the train and kalipare meat for weeks at a time. I saw the fiery cliffs of Naraka, where millions of naked people swarmed above the rivers of fire and lava that rained from the sky like constant streams of hail. I remember Veriden, where the tall humanoid creatures had legs that bent backwards, like the legs of a bird.  
  
Eventually, we passed through the last of the stops, the one labeled ULTIMATE REALITY. As the front of the train disappeared into a vortex of spinning light, I saw Brother’s eyes gleam with a strange kind of existential terror.  
  
“God, I hate this place,” Brother murmured to himself. A moment later, our carriage flew through the radiant gate into that other world, the eternal moment at the center of all things.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I tried to scream, but it seemed like the sounds moved in hundreds of spatial dimensions, writhing backwards and forwards in time like ripples on a pond. The train began to peel away all around me, layers of metal and pink flesh ripping away as if in a hurricane.   
  
Brother’s skin disappeared as if it were being eaten by a corrosive acid, then his muscles started to fade away, until he stood there, a skeleton with a chattering mouth. A tunnel of light with millions of lidless, staring eyes formed at his heart, spiraling all around us until they formed a wall of pure consciousness rising up into infinity.  
  
I looked down, seeing my own body peeling away in layers. Soon, I only saw the light spilling out from my heart, and in that moment, I forgot who I was or even that I was once human at all. Revelation like a tsunami shattered my mind, and all illusions shattered with them.  
  
I saw reality from the viewpoints of all beings in all moments of time. A sound like a cosmic gong rang and shook everything beneath the many layers of reality. These countless layers shimmered like mirages above the eternal, timeless moment at the source. I saw universes created and destroyed in the blink of an eye as a Deathless Self looked out from every heart, seeing all moments of time but not imprisoned within it.  
  
Worlds were destroyed by civilizations, alien and human alike, and I saw into the minds of the killer and killed. Mountains of corpses collected and rotted all across space and time, but inside the heart of every one, I saw the same consciousness peeking out, the Deathless Self like a trillion omniscient eyes.   
  
It existed outside of time, existed purely of eternal bliss and peace, and, while seeing everything, it never experienced the suffering of these many beings passing through the mirage of this strange universe. Always, it lay beyond.  
  
I saw into the deepest hells opening like worlds of lava far below me and found the light of the Self there, too. Even during trillions of years of endless agony and suffering, it stood like a deep well of peace, untouched and tranquil.  
  
And then we were through, and I was falling and gasping, looking over at Brother. He lay on the floor, sweating heavily, his eyes wide.  
  
“Yeah, it’s the same every time,” he said, wiping his pale face and standing up. “Same goddamn thing every time. But it fades rapidly once you’re through. In a few hours, you’ll barely remember what happened there.” I could only stutter, confused as to who I was or why I had a body at all. The glimpse of ULTIMATE REALITY rapidly faded, however, and within a few minutes, I could barely remember what I had seen.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It wasn’t long after that the living train pulled up to Market Street substation with a deep exhalation, as if the train itself were sighing in relief after a long journey completed. The brakes squealed with a high-pitched cacophony.  
  
Floating on clouds of bliss, I glanced back at Brother one last time, seeing his lined face and ancient eyes. He was a true survivor, a killer, a kind of man I’d never before encountered and likely never would again. He raised his hands, his face still stony and grim. I gave him a faint half-smile as I turned away.  
  
At 3:33 AM, I stepped off the X77, the sole survivor of all those who wished to return. But I still carry all their stories in my heart as I go forward.
