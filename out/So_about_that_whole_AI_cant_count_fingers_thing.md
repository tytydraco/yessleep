A few days ago Rob, the new intern, came into my office about three in the afternoon.  He looked pale.  Hell, he looked sick.

"Rob, damn man, you okay?" I said, looking up from my workstation.  The newest beta for our AI Model was in the final stages of compiling.  It had been our biggest project for almost 9 months.

Rob swallowed hard.  "I... I don't know.  I found a problem." he said.

This caused me to raise an eyebrow.  “A problem with the new AI model?" I asked.  If so, this could be a problem.  A lot was riding on the roll-out of this new software.

I could see Rob visibly take a moment to collect himself.  "Not exactly.  Let me show you something."

Rob walked over and put his laptop on my desk.  He opened it up.  "Take a look at this."

On the screen was an AI generated image.  The watermark and beta number for our new software was across the bottom.  It was a simple scene, a smiling blond woman eating salad.  A standard test image we used to calibrate the AI learning model.

"What's the problem?" I asked.

"The fingers.  Look at the fingers." Rob said.

I looked closer.  The hand holding the salad fork had six fingers.

"Rob, don't beat yourself up.  The entire AI industry has been dealing with that weird issue for a while now.  Hell, it's practically a meme at this point."

"It's not that." Rob said, with this odd break to his voice, and suddenly I realized Rob wasn't sick... he was scared.

"Rob, what the hell is going on?" I asked, concerned.

Rob looked around nervously.  "Come over here, I want you to look at something."

I stepped over to the doorway to my office, looking out over the cubicle farm where dozens of employees were working.

Rob was scanning the cubicles, his eyes moving in a weird, darting motion.  He stopped and gestured over to one of the workers. A stocky older guy working in a desk not far from my office. "See that one.  Eric I think his name is."

"Eric Simmons, he's one of our database guys.  You know Eric.  He's worked here for years, as long as I have." I said, not sure where this was going.

"Count the fingers on the hand he's using to control his mouse." Rob said.

"Rob this is getting wei-" I started.

"Just... trust me." Rob said.

I sighed.  I counted the fingers on Eric's hand.  5.

"He's got 5 fingers Rob, same as you and me." I said.  Maybe the stress of the deadline had gotten to Rob.

"Okay now... don't look directly at him.  Look... ah... there look at the motivational poster on the wall behind him.  And then, from like the edge of your vision, count the fingers." Rob said, keeping his voice down.

"Rob listen man, this job is stressful, I get it.  Take the afternoon off, get a start on your weekend.  You've worked your ass off you deser-"

"Please" Rob said, cutting me off.  His voice practically begging.  "Just... do it."

Even now I’m not 100% sure why I humored him.  I closed my eyes and blinked several times.  I focused on the poster, some generic office print, a picture of a sculling team with some trite teamwork slogan slapped below it.  Never paid it any attention.  With the picture in my focus and Eric's hand on the edges of my vision, I counted again.

Six.

I blinked.   I looked, directly looked at Eric's hand again.  5.  I counted again.  5.  Four fingers and a thumb.  No question about it.

I looked back at the poster, letting my eyes focus on a point behind it like one of those old Magic Eye pictures.  I looked at Eric's hand again.  6 fingers.  A thumb and five full other digits.

Rod could see the expression on my face.  "You see it too, don't you?"

"I.... what the hell?" I finally let out.

"Step back in your office with me.  I'll try to explain." Rob said.

Back in my office Rob gestured at his laptop.  "When I got brought on the team they asked me to look into the whole 'wrong number of fingers' problem.  So I decided to start at the most basic, run a simple pattern algorithm using a large number of pictures of hands.  So I used these." He pointed at the screen.  It showed dozens of pictures of hands.  Hands holding plates with food.  Hands holding plastic party drink cups.  But from the background and certain faces I knew these pictures.

"The company Christmas party." I said.

"Exactly." Rob said.  "They were already on the share drive, no issues with rights, and this was just a basic first test run it was never gonna get used for anything.  I really just needed some images to start out with.  So I used the base AI model we're already working on and ran them through it.  Got a bunch of pictures back with the wrong number of fingers.  But here's the thing... I don't know why.  I looked over the code.  There's no reason counting fingers should be an issue.  Like you said it's almost a meme at this point but has anyone actually stopped to ask why?  Why something that can make a photo realistic face can't count fingers?  Computers are a lot better at counting than they are at aesthetics and facial features."

"Rob listen these AI models are some of the most complicated pieces of software ever made, we're going to be finding quirks in them for decades...." I said, trying to convince myself as much as Rob.

"Yeah, I had the same thought.  So I did another test run.  With a dozen pictures of fake plastic hands as the base image model.  And ran it through the exact same AI Model.  Every single generated image had the proper number of fingers." Rob said.

He bought up another set of pictures on his laptop.  Again a slideshow of dozens of pictures of hands, but all fake.  Mannequin hands, those possible wooden art hands, gloves on stands… all with the correct number of finges.

“I ran this through the exact same algorithm.  It makes zero sense why these would come out any different.”

"So Rob what are you saying?  And what does this have to do with Eric's hand?" I asked.

Rob exhaled. "I'm saying I don't think the AI model is generating the wrong number of fingers.  I think the AI model is right.  I think it is seeing something we're not seeing."

I made a nervous laugh.  "What?  Humans all have a secret hidden extra finger that AI models can see, but we can't?"

Rob didn't return the laugh.  "Our hands are in the picture from the Christmas party.”

Involuntarily, I looked down at my hand.  5 fingers.

This time Rob did laugh.  "I've been doing the same thing.  Staring at my hands, trying to look at it from every angle and every field of focus.  No luck."

"So... so what does this all mean?" I said, pulling my eyes away from my hand.

Rob shrugged.  "I have no idea.  I don't have enough data yet to tell if this... anomaly is in everyone or not.  I'd need a sample size many factors bigger than this to even start model patterns or trends.

“Did… did everyone’s hand show the wrong number of fingers?” I asked, not sure which answer I was hoping for.

Rob shook his head.  “No.  About 1 in 10.  Eric was one of them, that’s why I pointed him out.  Doug in accounting.  Janet in HR.  And the CEO.  That’s why I came to you.  You’re the senior person who wasn’t showing the wrong number of fingers when I ran those pictures through the AI model.”

“Rob, this is insane.  It has to be a software glitch of some kind.  It’s freaky as hell, I admit but…” I trailed off, not sure how to respond.

“I know but…” Rob paused and I could see on his face he was choosing his words very carefully “I’m very good with this stuff.  If you could see the data like I do, really see the code, you’d get it.  This software is running correctly.  Something is wrong with… reality.” He looked down, perhaps a little taken by how absurd it sounded when he said it out loud.  But when he spoke again there as a powerful earnestness to his voice.  “Something is very wrong with some of the people here.” 

I took a deep breath.  To hell if he wasn’t sounding convincing in pure conviction if nothing else.  But still, what he was suggesting was crazy.  I decided to aim for a middle ground and put the ball back in his court.

“So what do you suggest with do?” I asked him.

“I don’t know yet.  I’m gonna spend the weekend taking more pictures.  I need to know how far this goes.” Rod said.

This caused me a moment of worry.  Not only was he starting to sound just a little more unhinged one of our employees getting arrested or going viral for walking around the city photographing people's hands was not what the company needed right now.

“Rod like I said… go home, get some rest.  If you want to look into this more okay but… be subtle about it.” I told him.

“Yeah I guess you’re right.  I… I need to think on this some more.  I’ll be back Monday morning okay?  Maybe after a good night’s sleep this will make sense.” Rod said and I thought I saw a tiny flicker of relief on his face.

Rob left.  I went back to working my section of the code, mostly front end and UI tweaks, Rob was really the genius as to the core of the AI model. 

About an hour before quitting time I happened to glance up and see Eric standing in the doorway to my office.

“Oh hey Eric, sorry I didn’t see you standing there.” I said.Eric smiled.  “Oh no worry.  Just swung by to ask, what were you and Rob talking about earlier, it seemed intense.” he asked.  His voice was non-committal but for some reason I detected a slight edge in the question.

“Oh nothing, just ironing out some last minute bugs with the AI model.”  I said. I gave a short laugh “Poor kid is still trying to work out the kinks in the hand modeling.”

Eric’s smile dropped.  Then it quickly returned, but the new smile felt very forced.  Then the weirdest thing happened.  Eric walked over to my desk and in a very weird, very deliberate motion reached down and using only his fingertips touched my desk with his fingers spread.

He’s intentionally showing me his hand and fingers, I thought with a slight shudder.

Eric spoke.  “Yes that’s quite a difficult problem I understand.  I hope Rob doesn’t blame himself if he can’t solve it.”  There was nothing specifically threatening in either his tone or his words, but there was something, something just under the surface that made me want to run away.

Eric slowly took his hand away from my desk, and then without another word, turned and walked out of my office.

I sat there for a few moments. I worked in tech long enough to shrug off weirdness from the techie types.  It comes with the territory and high end software development especially as a personality type begins at “delightfully quirky” and ends at “downright fucking weird.”  But still I’d worked with Eric for years and never came out of an interaction with him feeling this… creeped out.

I had enough for the day.  I made sure all my work was saved and backed up to the company file server, locked my workstation and head out.  On the way down the hallway I passed Doug from accounting.  He looked at me, gave me a smile that never touched his eyes, and slowly and deliberately, with his fingers spread wide, waved a cheerful goodbye to me and said “Enjoy your weekend!”

Janet from HR was in the front lobby, updating something on the big bulletin board.  When she saw me she smiled and started briskly tapping her fingernails, one by one, on the edge of the bulletin board as I walked by.

I drove home.  Tried not to think about it for the evening.  Tried really hard not to start at my hands and count the fingers.  I tried to watch TV but I kept getting distracted, keep counting the fingers on the actors and actress and newscasters.  I almost got watching into a Red Sox game but at one point the camera zoomed in on the pitcher’s hand while he had it behind his back before a pitch.  I turned it off after that.  They all had the correct number of fingers but I keep expecting to blink or see it out of the corner of my eye and see six.  I put on some music and drank a beer, then went to sleep.

I felt better in the morning and spent a normal Saturday and Sunday, mostly convinced that Rob had just had a minor breakdown from the stress of the project and his inability to fix what I was again thinking was just a long running and hard to pin down software glitch.  I decided I’d talk to him on Monday morning, pull him off the project for his own good if need be.

And that was it.  Until Monday morning.  I’m not at the office.  I’m at coffee shop a few blocks from my house.  About 6:30, about a half hour before I usually head out for work my phone started blowing up.  Rob was dead.  The morning news report filled me, or at least filled me in with what they knew.  On Saturday afternoon he had gotten into an altercation at a Target.  He was following people around, taking pictures of people’s hands.  Some father had taken him as a pervert trying to take pictures of his daughter and clocked him one and it escalated into a minor fight that someone had, of course, managed to catch on their cell phone camera.  Both Rob and the other guy were let off with a warning.  That wouldn’t even had made the news except that about 3, 3:30 on Monday morning a newspaper truck found Rob dead near his car, parked in the parking lot of our office.  He had used his badge to buzz into the building about midnight.  The login records showed he worked at his workstation for a couple of hours.  Then he had deleted a bunch of stuff from his profile and left.  Then someone had killed him.  The delivery driver found him next to his car.  His head had been bashed in good.  His laptop was smacked on the ground next to him.  The police are looking for the guy Rob got into the fight with on Saturday but I don’t think that’s the guy who killed him.

Because whoever killed him cut off his fingers and took the time to arrange them in 2 neat little rows off 5 right next to his body.

My phone is ringing constantly but I’m not answering it.  I’m sipping my coffee and counting fingers on people.  I’m wondering whether to go to the police and counting fingers on people. 

I’m counting fingers on people and I don’t know what else to do. 

I hope I figure it out before I finally count 6 fingers on someone’s hand.
