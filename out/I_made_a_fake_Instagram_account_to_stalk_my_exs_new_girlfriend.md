It all started when me and my girlfriend of four years broke up, it was a tough breakup, the “I don’t love you anymore” type of break ups. I left her apartment and came back to my parents, heartbroken. I unfollowed all of her social media and couldn’t get over her. Because the breakup was her idea this whole thing led, according to my friends who still followed her. To her finding a new relationship very quickly after we cut things off. She was a beautiful girl, much skinner and a few years younger than me. It made me furious and jealous. 

At first, I used some of my friend’s Instagram accounts on their phones to stalk my ex’s profile once in a while which was pretty harmless and natural but that wasn’t enough for me, I asked my best friend for her Instagram password saying I need it for stalking her, my best friend judged me but went with it and gave me the password. Then, the “once in a while” became daily, then hourly… I wanted to stalk her new girl’s profile so badly but it was locked. Which led me to start a fake profile using pictures of a girl I knew and dated for a short while from college that lives very far away with no close circles to other people I know, so her chances of finding out was almost zero. I used another generic fake name with her last name to make it sound real and even made a similar bio, and added a pride flag to it. 

I didn’t send them both requests immediately because they won’t just approve a stranger with 0 followers. I started slowly by sending follow requests to people in my ex’s and her new gf’s circles, followed some gay celebrities, known music artists and even some art accounts to spice things up. Then eventually when I got around 200 followers, made some stories and posts I sent them both a request and even got approved. My stalking dream came true, I stared at their pictures everyday, knew their dates locations and slowly that was all I could think about.

The stalking became more and more intense, I made several social media profiles with my new fake identity and discovered everything I need to know about my ex’s girlfriend. To sum it up- Her name is Emily, she’s 23 and had the most perfect life. I even found some of her friends on dating apps and chatted with them casually, never moving past the talking stage obviously but during that talking stage I found out some little details related to her that made me excited every single time. 

My parents started to be really worried about me. I would not leave my room unless it’s for eating. My bed sheets started to smell from the months of not changing them, my body hair was out of control and I gained a lot of weight. I didn’t leave my house for months until I saw my ex posting a picture with Emily’s friend saying she is excited for her party tomorrow. I obviously knew at that stage where that friend lived and I decided I wanted to come to the party and finally see the love of my life and Emily, my newest, dearest obsession. I got to the house, knocked at the door and was greeted with a scream. I don’t know why they screamed, is my outfit bad? 
Their screams were so loud, one by one, it made me feel so scared and I did everything to stop them from screaming. 
Until it was silent.
