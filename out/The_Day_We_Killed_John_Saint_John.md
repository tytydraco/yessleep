The title says it all. We—no, I—killed a man named John Saint John. I’m going to die soon and don’t have anyone left to tell. I don’t want forgiveness. I want a witness.

Perhaps that decision from long ago haunts me enough to tell it to strangers. It’s funny what goes through your mind when you know you’re going to die. To think that I thought it’d be cancer from one too many cigarettes or from a .38 to my temple. If only.

We killed him on May 16th, 1989. Buried his body in a holler that never seems to get water, just outside of the old Benison Mining site. I doubt there is a body.

You’re probably wondering why. Why? Why kill a man? Who was he to me and the 5 others at the job site? 

He was a man that drove us mad. When I first laid my eyes on him I knew he’d be trouble. He was short and thin, pranced around when stepped. Everything he did seemed to spite us or slow us down as we toiled hard on those long days. 

I was a supervisor then. He came to us out of nowhere, hired on by favors of someone above my pay-grade, I don’t know. His coming listed someone else from somewhere different. I put him to work with Red immediately to see what the boy was made of. At the time, most of us were borderline criminals or escapists who never got caught. If you can’t hang with the group, you probably couldn’t do your work and meet quota. 

That’s how it’s been and that’s how it will be for our line of work. The mines will eat you and swallow you if you’re not hard. That’s why we bullied newcomers. Or, that’s just how things were back then.

The company cared less of its people, as it knew who worked for it. Out there, on a job, it was inmates watching inmates. And that’s what I did.

See, John Saint John wasn’t like you or I. No, he was useless. Couldn’t lift anything, complained, was slow, showed up last. Became a real liability for me and the crew especially in the conditions we were in alone in the country. If you got hurt, hell, expect at least 2 hours for emergency services. 

Weird. That man, I guess boy, said he was raised by foxes from Maine. He licked his hands and refused to pee in the toilet. The fool had a fascination with ketchup and ate all of our supply the first day!

We gave him mundane tasks such as fetch us water and clear rubble. He did it, slowly, talking about, “how to optimize work flow to make it faster.”

Every meal he chewed with his mouth open, laughed at his own jokes, and on off time pretended to be some animal—a fox, I think. No matter how much we harassed him or verbally assaulted him it flowed through him. He’d tell fake war stories to Navarte who was in Vietnam. John Saint John was only 19!

The crew had enough, they complained to me and in turn I complained to the company to get a replacement. 

“Handle it,” is what they would tell me.

“How? Another reprimand? The unions won’t let me dock pay!”

“Figure it out. Call us if there is an issue. A real issue.”

I gritted my teeth and got off the radio to find this kid trying to scratch his head with his foot like an animal. I swatted him. He fell and looked at me. At that moment, man.

His face was of pure dejection. The dark sockets of his eyes held back tears as his lip quivered as if he couldn’t understand what he did wrong.

“Were you raised in a fucking barn?”

He looked away and said, “No, I never had parents. Sheriff found me before I could talk. I was with foxes, in a den.”

I rolled my eyes and pretended to not see his emotion. The other boys heard all this and laughed. They pointed and jeered at him.

“Everyone back to work! Get up! Stop being a pussy!” 

Oh I opened the flood gates. The usual harassment to new guys became hazing. The boys chastised John Saint John, called him fox boy. He was bullied relentlessly and told to stand as we worked. But, John Saint John didn’t seem to mind. He yapped about how we could improve, went on about useless information at the depth of an encyclopedia entry, and smacked on food as we toiled.

Resentment grew each day until Navarte and Clyde came to me in private.

“Boss,” Clyde said.

“We are going to kill him! We caught him playing with the lock to the blasting caps. I think, no I know, he is going to kill us.”

“On account of the bullying boss,” Navarte added.

I didn’t say anything but walked up to John Saint John. He was sniffing some dandelion and muttering to himself. I caught him staring at the explosives before, always after the crew was mean to him. But Clyde swore he saw him twist something—though Clyde never wore his glasses underground. Either way, I had enough, hours of his annoyance came to a head.

“You fucking freak!” I yelled as I kicked him over. The other boys took cue and began kicking him. Mob violence erupted and every infraction that John Saint John ever did to us came back ten fold in our feet.

Every bad joke, every awkward staring, all the times he chewed with his mouth open, all the times he used all the hot water. It all came out. Maybe it was stress of the job or true hatred for him. Perhaps it was just a reflection of who we were. But he did try to kill us I still tell myself.

He lay there, moaning in a broken pile of bones and flesh on the warm dirt. Everyone looked at each, unsure whether to feel sorry for what we’ve done or relieved. Killing a man takes a lot, John Saint John was not dead. No not yet.

Rocko signaled to Clyde and they left us. Navarte knelt down beside John Saint John. Each breath he took was shallow and sounded like the last bits of soda being sucked through a straw.

“He’ll die soon,” Navarte said.

“Not if we get him help,” Red trailed off. The fifth man, Kyle, looked at me as if to say, “What now boss?” Deep down, I knew I should have turned us all in. Though, fear of punishment, incarceration for what we tried to do set me down a different path.

John Saint John whimpered like some caught puppy, when they tear something up and know they’re in trouble. I feel sick just thinking about it, I nearly threw up then too. I met his eyes. They were confused like a dog that doesn’t know what wrong is.

“Why am I me?” He mouthed, words unable to exit his broken lungs.

“We gotta end it boss,” Red said. “Nah make him suffer,” spat Navarte. Navarte slapped our chests to break our trance, witnessing another man die.

Rocko and Clyde came back with axes and shovels. No one said anything but me, “Okay.”

He had to have died then. We didn’t want to use material from the camp so we hacked him up and carried his parts down and away from camp. We buried him in a deep hole. 

I had the crew light his body on fire and smash the ashes. Told them to destroy all evidence of this day and we made our alibis. I told corporate that John Saint John is missing, last seen wandering toward town. Sheriffs came, of course, so did the corporation to launch their investigations. 

Though everything related to mining halted. After 4 months of questioning—different officers, same room, same lies—the case stalled. 4 months of skeptical looks and crossed arms as detectives listened to our lies. John Saint John was labeled missing but we knew the truth. I never lied so well in my life. After all, it was John Saint John’s fault, he brought us to this point. 

Well we left that job. The crew and I went our separate ways, the company thought it was best for us to not be together. I didn’t think much of John Saint John other than the violence I witnessed. 

That was, until the crew began to die. First it was Rocko. I heard he died on the 16th of May, 1990 in some bar fight outside of Reno. He probably had it coming. Then Red died a year later. Rumor from other crews was that he kept having nightmares about some fox, screamed and raved that he didn’t want to be cremated. He jumped down a shaft, 200 feet deep, broke his legs but didn’t say a word. He died in the hospital. I heard later it was ruled a “suicide.”

I started keeping tabs on the others. I kept looking over my shoulder as if something was watching me. At night, outside my bedroom door, it sounded like foxes playing. I heard scampering from the shadows and tiny footsteps running away every time I turned around.

Days passed slowly and my work began to suffer. I retired in 1993. By then, I barely left the house. No one died yet and at the time I took that as a sign. That it was over. But the strange sounds and now shadows didn’t end.

May 16th, 1994 Clyde was found dead in a Benison mining dumpster. News reports said the police never found his limbs. I saw a fox in the background of the coverage.

I bought a gun shortly after, and didn't go outside much either. Computers were becoming a thing and I invested my time in that, hence why I am here now.

Years passed before Navarte reached out to me in 1997. I got his letter on the 12th of February, a date of no significance. It was a picture of where we buried John Saint John. 

He wrote, “His ashes are still here, at least from what I can tell. Why? Why do I still see him?”

I phoned his house. Nothing. I called again, nothing. I waited after a pour of scotch, pistol on my lap. I called the police and asked for a wellness check on Navarte. The police said they’d send someone out. I waited and waited but nothing came.

Navarte lived with his wife a state over. Word reached me that the police found them both dead. Murder-suicide. However, the news said there was a third suspect…

I began drinking more. It’s just suicide, guilt over killing a man. I thought I wasn’t like the others. I should have been first killed right? Though in my heart, after the first death, I knew I’d live long enough to regret.

Decades blurred together. But my phone always rang with the same question.

“Hello, this is so-and-so with blah-blah-blah, do you know a John Saint John? He listed you as a work reference.”

I hung up. Every time. Goddamnit.

I got a letter in 2010 that just said, “Clyde is no longer with us. I’m sorry but he told me to not have you at the funeral. I don’t know how best to say this but, this is what Clyde told me to tell you: 

“Tell the world what we did.” 

There was water damage on it. Probably from a tear. I heard it was another “suicide.” It’s the same language in all police reports.

I fumbled with what to do. Police nor preacher seemed viable for any advice towards my circumstance. Clyde’s right. So here I am. 2025 I finally got tired of wondering when.

I know it is my turn. As I sit in hospice, I’m not dead yet. That’s why I heard him, just the other day, prancing around in the courtyard as he did years ago. Will he come for me? Will the docs rule my natural passing as suicide? It’s all in our heads, right? 

But… I had a letter with no stamp come in this morning. No return address, just mine. I mean, who still sends letters? Though inside, was the same dirt I buried John Saint John in.

Now, as I type this, I can feel his breath on my neck. Smelly as the day I killed John Saint John.
