What awaits us in the dark?

I received my answer to that question thirty years ago.

In autumn of 1993, I was seventeen years old, a senior at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic High School, commonly referred to as “St. Mary’s.” I was looking forward to completing my senior year, graduating from high school, and going off to college with my best friends, Stephanie and Siobhan (“Shan”). However, we had to earn our place at the table, so to speak, by partaking in a tradition among all incoming senior year students, which was to explore the abandoned Mater Dolorosa Home and School for Children.

Mater Dolorosa Home and School for Children was both an orphanage and the first iteration of the parochial school which would eventually become the present–day St. Mary’s. The headmistress was a Catholic nun, who became the subject of an urban legend after she allegedly committed suicide by leaping from the school’s bell tower. The veracity of this legend was hotly debated among the students of St. Mary’s. While some students scoffed at the legend, others were adamant it was true and that the ghost of the nun haunted the grounds of Mater Dolorosa.

Since her name in Christ was lost in the mists of time, she came to be known simply as “Sister Smile,” because whenever she entered a room, she would always command the children in her care to smile.

“Never forget to smile,” she said. “A Christian should always smile.”

The godly smiles on the childrens’ faces helped hide the evil they had to endure.

Although it was commonly believed Sister Smile was a good and holy nun, an image of true Christian charity in an age of apathy and indifference, who reared her “fallen angels”—her nickname for the orphans in her care—with a gentle and loving hand, she was said in the legend to have made the orphans’ lives nothing short of a living Hell. The legend said she was a woman whose position and power, albeit limited as they were by her sex and the time in which she lived, corrupted her. She physically, spiritually, and verbally abused her “fallen angels,” under the guise of corporal punishment, by flogging them with a small whip, forcing them to kneel on grains of rice, and even depriving them of food and water until they completed their assigned duties. There was a story related in the most popular version of legend in which Sister Smile beat an orphan so mercilessly to the point he bled, his crimson blood spattering on her all–white habit. After she freed the child, who was racked with sobs, bleeding and in pain, from her clutches, she admonished him, “Never forget,” forcing his lips into a smile with her blood stained fingers.

It was only a matter of time before she went too far.

The legend alleges that Sister Smile locked an orphaned girl in an otherwise unused room, without food or water or even use of the bathroom, among other things, for accidentally breaking dishes while doing her chores. Leaving her in the room for a week, she unlocked the door to find the girl dead, having succumbed to hunger and thirst. Her cause of death was reported by Sister Smile as tuberculosis, but when authorities began an investigation into the matter, she realized the extent of her abuse and what she had done. She said she started to hear “voices in the dark,” which were driving her to despair. *Vile!* *Evil!* *Monster!* She could no longer bear them. She could never atone for her sins. Walking up to the bell tower from the stairs in the chapel, wearing her angelic white habit, Sister Smile crossed her arms at her breast, and she leapt to the courtyard below.

Her mangled body writhed as she lay dying on the walkway. The children gathered around her as she choked on her own blood, her limbs bent and broken into unnatural positions, and one of the boys grabbed his pocket knife. He slit her mouth from ear to ear, and when asked why by the authorities, he answered, “I didn’t want her to ever forget to smile.”

Upon Sister Smile’s suicide, which was reported in local news as a natural death, Mater Dolorosa was closed in 1963, and the remaining orphans were placed into different orphanages across the country. The parochial school of St. Mary’s Church was rebuilt in a more convenient location, farther away from the woods of Ashley Falls and closer to the center of town in Sheffield.

It was as if none of it ever happened.

*Did it ever happen?*

Although Shan and I were largely unconvinced by the legend and its believers, we were persuaded by Stephanie to throw caution to the wind and explore the abandoned orphanage and school anyway.

“It’s tradition,” she insisted. “Right?”

Against our better judgment, Shan and I agreed to go legend tripping with Stephanie. Before we were able to actually go, we had to get directions to the site from a classmate of ours, who admitted he had never personally been to Mater Dolorosa. Nevertheless, he insisted, “It’s real,” while warning us to be careful.

“You don’t know what waits for you in the dark.”

After our first full week of school, Stephanie and Shan stayed over at my house on Friday, and we made plans to sneak out after midnight to explore Mater Dolorosa and the legend of Sister Smile. Before they arrived, I was reading one of the love letters I received from Tom, Stephanie’s boyfriend. “I will run to you, down whatever road you choose,” he wrote, and I glanced over at one of the many pregnancy tests I had recently taken. *Two lines.* I was pregnant with my best friend’s boyfriend’s baby. Despite my upbringing and Catholic faith, I was considering an abortion. *How could I raise this child, conceived in lust and lies and infidelity?* In any case, I was unable to think any more about my situation as Stephanie and Shan arrived at my house. I quickly placed the letters and tests in one of my drawers, and I brought my friends upstairs to my bedroom. We talked and read magazines and recounted parts of the legend as we counted down to midnight.

When the clock finally struck midnight, Stephanie perked up and asked, “Is it time?” I nodded my head as she asked the question again to Shan, who answered, “Yes.” Sneaking out of my house, we slipped into the night and entered my mother’s car, driving to the woods near Ashley Falls in Sheffield.

As we drew closer to Ashley Falls, an overwhelming sense of dread arose in all of us. None of us wanted to say anything, for fear of putting it out there and thereby making it real, but eventually Shan asked, “Should we turn around?”

There was a beat before Stephanie answered, “No.”

“Jennifer?” Shan asked.

“Not now,” Stephanie interrupted. “We’ve come this far.”

Although I had misgivings, I continued driving, feeling a heavy weight on my shoulders. Closing in on the woods of Ashley Falls, my mother’s car radio suddenly started playing. It was tuned to a classic Christian music station.

♪ *Mommy told me something* / *A little girl should know* / *It’s all about the Devil* / *And I’ve learned to hate him so. . . .* ♪

I turned the radio off before the chorus could begin, but the fact it turned on at all sent a shiver down my spine, because none of us touched the radio dial. Shortly thereafter, we arrived at the woods in which the ruins of Mater Dolorosa stood. We exited the car, and we stood at the edge of the woodland.

“Are we ready?” Stephanie asked.

Shan and I nodded hesitantly, and Stephanie took that as her signal to head into the woods. Shan ran in behind her, but I looked around the area before I joined them.

*Will we regret this?*

The autumn leaves crunched beneath our feet as we headed further into the woods, our sense of dread exacerbated by how close we were getting to Mater Dolorosa. Eventually, we entered a clearing in the middle of the woods, on which stood the ruins of the abandoned orphanage and school. Time and nature had taken its toll over the past thirty years. The main building was dilapidated, moss and vines grown over the entrance doors. Above the doors, there was an affixed sign, *Mater Dolorosa Home and School for Children*.

In what remained of the courtyard, there was no sign of the bloody mess which Sister Smile left as her final mark on the world, but there was a large, white, albeit faded, statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was surprisingly intact amid the ruins of the Home. The clearing on which the ruins stood appeared to have little–to–no vegetation other than the moss and vines on the building itself. The trees surrounding the clearing appeared to grow inward, as if they were growing away from the ruins. *It was as if they could feel the evil within.* At the beginning of the path that led to the front doors, there was a white cross planted into the ground, which was allegedly in honor of those who died there. In what appeared to be red paint, a message was scrawled on the cross.

*GOD IS NOT HERE*.

Walking up the concrete steps of the Home, we opened its doors, and we were almost immediately overwhelmed by the dank and musty smell of the place. The interior was in serious disrepair, vandalized all over by graffiti. The darkness inside the Home was almost palpable.

“Where do we go?” I asked.

“We’re supposed to go to the bell tower through the chapel,” Stephanie answered.

With the help of a flashlight, Stephanie led us to the chapel. As we walked through the Home, we saw stereotypical Satanic graffiti, which caused us to roll our eyes, along with evidence of past explorations of the Home, which we tried our best to avoid. When we drew closer to the chapel, Shan pulled us back, and she asked, “Do you hear that?”

As we grew silent, we were able to hear distinct, albeit muffled, voices coming from the chapel. Creeping toward the entrance of the chapel, we heard a group of people reciting what sounded like prayers. I peeked into the chapel, and I saw five figures in hooded robes. Turning back to the girls, I whispered, “We’re not alone,” and as we all peeked into the chapel together, we saw the figures worshiping the powers of darkness by light of the full moon. However, the moon was briefly obscured by clouds, and when its light returned to illuminate the chapel, there was no one there.

*There was nothing but darkness*.

Against my better judgment and the advice of my friends, I entered the chapel, followed close behind by Stephanie and Shan, and we confirmed there was no one in the chapel.

*The shadows took them*.

Nevertheless, we were horrified by what we did find. There were decomposing and skeletal remains of small animals, bloodstains, and an extinguished fire. The walls were covered with graffiti, most of which was blasphemous in nature. An extensive work of graffiti, bordering on amateur art, depicted the Devil as a hellmouth, feasting on the souls of the damned, the opening of the mouth being the doorway leading to the bell tower. I was not entirely certain, but it appeared as if the Devil was painted partially with dried, ruddy brown blood. *Someone painted Hell on these walls.* As we processed what we were seeing, we agreed that the dread and fear we felt was almost unbearable, but we still entered the Hellmouth, walked up the stairs, and entered the bell tower.

Entering the bell tower, we were almost immediately confronted by a nun, dressed in an angelic white habit, standing at the edge of the tower. The nun was facing our direction, but while the full moon illuminated her from the back, she was consumed by shadows in the front, so we could not see her face.

“Who are you?” Shan quavered.

She did not answer.

Before we were able to ask any more questions, she spoke to us. Although we could not see her face, we were able to hear her otherworldly voice, filled with a sort of calm hatred.

“You know who I am,” she said. “I know who you are.”

“Who are we?” Shan asked.

“Siobhan,” she said. “You are a weakling. I was weak like you.”

“What?”

“Have you not told them?” She asked. “They are your friends.”

“Tell us what, Shan?” I asked.

“Nothing. . . .” Shan trailed off.

“Do you not remember suicide is a sin?”

*What?*

“You think that does not matter, since you do not even believe in God anymore.”

“Shan?”

Tears trickled down Shan’s cheeks, her pain and humiliation evident on her face. *She doesn’t believe in God?* Out of the three of us, Shan was the most devoted to her faith. *She was planning on committing suicide?* Stephanie and I knew Shan struggled with depression, but we did not know it went that far. *Why hadn’t she told us any of this?*

“It is for the best that you did not tell Stephanie,” she continued. “When she moves away after graduation, she will not waste any further thoughts on either of you.”

*What?* The three of us planned to attend the same college after graduation. *Now she was moving?* I felt betrayed. She was going to derail all of our plans, and she did not even have the decency to tell us. *What would become of our plans now?*

“When were you going to tell us?”

Before Stephanie was able to answer me, she was interrupted.

“Would you not know betrayal better than anyone, Jennifer?”

Although I attempted to interrupt her, she continued undeterred.

“It is a girl,” she said. “Do you think she will have Tom’s eyes? Perhaps his wavy hair or his dimpled chin?”

I felt a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach.

“Yet you want to dispose of her like refuse. You think that will solve everything.”

“What is she talking about, Jennifer?” Stephanie asked.

As I prepared to lie to Stephanie and deny the fact I was even pregnant, let alone with her boyfriend’s baby, the moon was briefly obscured by clouds, enshrouding us in darkness. When the moon reappeared from behind the clouds, I saw Stephanie and Shan had inexplicably disappeared.

Yet I was not alone.

She was with me.

I started to cry as she began to emerge from the shadows, her gnarled and mangled body and mutilated face lurching toward me.

With all of my strength, I looked away from her and ran to the stairs, but I heard her footfalls directly behind me. Before I was able to make it down the first step, I felt a tight grip on my shoulders. As a ghostly hand reached around and touched my belly, I heard her otherworldly voice whisper in my ear.

“I will wait for you in the dark.”

Freed from her clutches, I ran downstairs, through the chapel and the rest of the Home, and out to the courtyard, where I found Stephanie and Shan, both of whom were as terrified as I was.

Stephanie glared at me, but before she was able to say anything, Shan shouted, “Let’s go.”

As she drove us away from the accursed grounds of Mater Dolorosa, Shan accidentally hit and knocked over the white cross, vandalized with red paint.

*God was never here*.

After we returned to school on the following Monday, Stephanie, Shan, and I did not speak of our experience at Mater Dolorosa among ourselves or to anyone else. People who asked were told nothing happened. As for myself, the experience further damaged my faith. Although I continued to believe in God, I have not felt close to Him since that night.

I do not know if I ever will again.

With the support of my parents, as well as Shan, and even Stephanie and Tom, I came to the decision to keep my baby. Shortly after graduation in June 1994, I gave birth to my daughter, whom I named “Bernadette,” after my Confirmation saint. Stephanie broke up with Tom, and while he was and is involved in our daughter’s life, we also broke off our own relationship. Stephanie and I made up after Tom and I apologized for what we did. We were friends until she moved away, after which we drifted apart. Shan sought professional help for her depression and suicidal ideation, and on her journey, she eventually regained her belief in God. She and I are still friends.

As the thirtieth anniversary of our experience at Mater Dolorosa approaches, I find myself recalling all of the events in vivid detail. In particular, I recall Sister Smile’s rules for the children, which were, “Behave, be good, and never forget to smile.” If you broke any of them, you paid for it with your flesh and blood.

I have followed those rules, even after all these years, lest she come for my flesh and blood, which she saw and felt growing within me that night.
