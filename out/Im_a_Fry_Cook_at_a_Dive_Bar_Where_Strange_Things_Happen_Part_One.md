The new guy walked into the kitchen looking like a lost puppy. He glanced around nervously like any one of us were going to jump out and attack him. “And this is the kitchen.” The grizzled voice of Dave, the owner, barely forced its way through the sounds of the kitchen. I couldn’t stand and watch them for long. We were neck deep in a rush and my screen was filling up by the second. I’m a fry cook at Dave’s Dive Bar. It’s a classic, crappy, little bar with neon signs peppering the small dining room walls. Behind the bar are shelves of cheap alcohol mostly used for shots; because Tommy, the bartender, couldn’t mix a cocktail if you stuck a gun in his face and demanded one. The tables looked like someone took their rage out on them with a hatchet, blowtorch, and whatever other object of destruction they could find.The only thing rougher than the tables, were the bars’ patrons. Most of them are bikers, drifters, or criminals of all shades. When the crowd gets rowdy enough they always end up stealing a street sign, which Dave proudly displays in the cramped hallway that leads to the graffitied bathrooms. It really helps lower your expectations so you won’t notice that they haven’t been cleaned for weeks. On the other side of the wall of cheap alcohol sits our cramped little kitchen; where I push out the greasiest food possible. With a fryer that I try to clean nightly but always seems to have dirty oil. There is also our flattop manned by Jose, and our broiler manned Nathan. We are the three musketeers that keep the customers’ bellies full so they can drink as much as possible.

  
“This is your new fry cook Levi.” My thoughts were pulled from the bar back to the present. I turned to see the new guy and Dave standing behind me. The newbie was standing behind Dave like a child hiding behind one of their parents.

  
I held out my hand and he stepped around the owner to shake it. He eyed the fryer as if the bubbling greasy would splash out and burn him. When I grasped his hand I made eye contact with him for the first time. He wore a Metallica t-shirt and blue jeans (we’ve never really had any kind of dress code). His hair was dirty blonde and his eyes were bluish gray and his face was clean shaven, that is if he could grow any facial hair at all. He was probably half a head taller than me but had so little presence that he might as well have been three feet smaller than me. “I’m Levi. Have you ever worked in a kitchen before?”

  
“I’m Henry,” He said, glancing back again at the fryer like it was going to sneak up on him “and no, I have never worked in a restaurant before.” My eyes flicked over to Dave, but he was too busy staring off into space to notice my annoyed look. The fact of the matter is, strange shit happens at this bar, and Dave knows it. Most experienced cooks don’t last here. This kid, who is inexperienced and jumpy, seems like the exact opposite of long-term-employee material. I looked back at the kid and smiled as genuinely as I could. “Welcome to the team Henry.”

  
For a completely new cook, Henry didn’t do too bad. He was quick to catch on to a lot of stuff, and when he finally warmed up to us, he was pretty chatty. He was able to take the little bit of shit we threw at him and sometimes, he gave it right back. I was just thinking about how Henry was lucky that nothing weird happened when…Ding. An order came in.

  
Henry and I looked up at the screen. Every station had a screen where table numbers, or customers’ names, would pop up with their orders. An order for “Davy J.” with fish sticks popped up on screen. My heart sank. Henry was about to go look for fish sticks to drop in the fryer when I grabbed him by the shoulder, “go hide in the walk-in Henry.” I looked over at Jose and Nathan and yelled, “I’ve got Davy J. on my screen cover for us.”

  
“Wait. What’s going on? Who’s Davy? And why do we have to go to the walk-in?” I kept shoving him ignoring his questions. We didn’t have much time and we needed to hide. I opened the walk-in, shoved him in, and closed it behind us. “What’s going on Levi?

  
I put my hand on his mouth to shush him and whisper-screamed into his ear, “Shut it! I’ll explain everything in a minute.” I don’t know how much time had passed, but eventually there were three knocks on the walk-in door. I sighed loudly and felt my muscles relax. I opened the door and Nathan stood there. He looked exhausted and pale. I heard Henry pipe up over my shoulder.

  
“What happened to you Nathan?” Nathan looked at him, then back to me, nodded and walked away. I turned to Henry and sighed.

  
“Henry…that last order had fish sticks on it…do we have fish sticks?” I saw confusion flash across his face; which turned to him looking deep in thought; then finally, he realized.

  
“No we don’t have them. So then why did the waiter or waitress…”

  
“Just say server.” I cut into his train of thought.

  
“Okay…Why did the server ring them up?” The sarcasm he added onto the word server irritated me a bit.

  
“They didn’t. Every once in a while Davy J will appear on our screen. It will ask for a seafood dish that we don’t serve. When that happens, anyone who has it on their screen must go hide in the walk-in. No one rings it up, it just appears there.” Henry seemed to be processing what I was saying for a while. Then, he laughed

  
“Oh I see. Nice try but I’m not so gullible.” His smug expression slowly changed to skepticism when he saw how serious I was. “What? You expect me to believe this? I know the new guy should expect to get pranked, but this is just obviously fake.”  
“It’s not.” I thought I saw his armor of disbelief crack slightly with the piercing matter-of-fact way I responded.

  
“Well what happens to the people who don’t hide?... Nathan looked really traumatized.”

  
“I shook my head. You will most likely experience that in the next couple of weeks while I train you. He comes around every few weeks to torment us. When that happens, do what I say and everything will be fine.” I didn’t know if Henry was actually listening to me or just pretending to. Like I said, most people don’t last here. Many of them leave voluntarily. The rest of them? Well…they are in the news as a missing person case. I know what happened to a few of them. The other’s…I have my suspicions…

  
The rest of the night went off without a hitch. I hope to see Henry tomorrow. I could see him becoming a good addition to the team. But a part of me doesn’t want to see him again because I don’t want anything to happen to him.
