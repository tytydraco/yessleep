The new guy walked into the kitchen looking like a lost puppy. He glanced around nervously like any one of us were going to jump out and attack him. “And this is the kitchen.” The grizzled voice of Dave, the owner, barely forced its way through the sounds of the kitchen. I couldn’t stand and watch them for long. We were neck deep in a rush and my screen was filling up by the second. I’m a fry cook at Dave’s Dive Bar. It’s a classic, crappy, little bar with neon signs peppering the small dining room walls. Behind the bar are shelves of cheap alcohol mostly used for shots; because Tommy, the bartender, couldn’t mix a cocktail if you stuck a gun in his face and demanded one. The tables looked like someone took their rage out on them with a hatchet, blowtorch, and whatever other object of destruction they could find.The only thing rougher than the tables, were the bars’ patrons. Most of them are bikers, drifters, or criminals of all shades. When the crowd gets rowdy enough they always end up stealing a street sign, which Dave proudly displays in the cramped hallway that leads to the graffitied bathrooms. It really helps lower your expectations so you won’t notice that they haven’t been cleaned for weeks. On the other side of the wall of cheap alcohol sits our cramped little kitchen; where I push out the greasiest food possible. With a fryer that I try to clean nightly but always seems to have dirty oil. There is also our flattop manned by Jose, and our broiler manned Nathan. We are the three musketeers that keep the customers’ bellies full so they can drink as much as possible.

  
“This is your new fry cook Levi.” My thoughts were pulled from the bar back to the present. I turned to see the new guy and Dave standing behind me. The newbie was standing behind Dave like a child hiding behind one of their parents.

  
I held out my hand and he stepped around the owner to shake it. He eyed the fryer as if the bubbling greasy would splash out and burn him. When I grasped his hand I made eye contact with him for the first time. He wore a Metallica t-shirt and blue jeans (we’ve never really had any kind of dress code). His hair was dirty blonde and his eyes were bluish gray and his face was clean shaven, that is if he could grow any facial hair at all. He was probably half a head taller than me but had so little presence that he might as well have been three feet smaller than me. “I’m Levi. Have you ever worked in a kitchen before?”

  
“I’m Henry,” He said, glancing back again at the fryer like it was going to sneak up on him “and no, I have never worked in a restaurant before.” My eyes flicked over to Dave, but he was too busy staring off into space to notice my annoyed look. The fact of the matter is, strange shit happens at this bar, and Dave knows it. Most experienced cooks don’t last here. This kid, who is inexperienced and jumpy, seems like the exact opposite of long-term-employee material. I looked back at the kid and smiled as genuinely as I could. “Welcome to the team Henry.”

  
For a completely new cook, Henry didn’t do too bad. He was quick to catch on to a lot of stuff, and when he finally warmed up to us, he was pretty chatty. He was able to take the little bit of shit we threw at him and sometimes, he gave it right back. I was just thinking about how Henry was lucky that nothing weird happened when…Ding. An order came in.

  
Henry and I looked up at the screen. Every station had a screen where table numbers, or customers’ names, would pop up with their orders. An order for “Davy J.” with fish sticks popped up on screen. My heart sank. Henry was about to go look for fish sticks to drop in the fryer when I grabbed him by the shoulder, “go hide in the walk-in Henry.” I looked over at Jose and Nathan and yelled, “I’ve got Davy J. on my screen cover for us.”

  
“Wait. What’s going on? Who’s Davy? And why do we have to go to the walk-in?” I kept shoving him ignoring his questions. We didn’t have much time and we needed to hide. I opened the walk-in, shoved him in, and closed it behind us. “What’s going on Levi?

  
I put my hand on his mouth to shush him and whisper-screamed into his ear, “Shut it! I’ll explain everything in a minute.” I don’t know how much time had passed, but eventually there were three knocks on the walk-in door. I sighed loudly and felt my muscles relax. I opened the door and Nathan stood there. He looked exhausted and pale. I heard Henry pipe up over my shoulder.

  
“What happened to you Nathan?” Nathan looked at him, then back to me, nodded and walked away. I turned to Henry and sighed.

  
“Henry…that last order had fish sticks on it…do we have fish sticks?” I saw confusion flash across his face; which turned to him looking deep in thought; then finally, he realized.

  
“No we don’t have them. So then why did the waiter or waitress…”

  
“Just say server.” I cut into his train of thought.

  
“Okay…Why did the server ring them up?” The sarcasm he added onto the word server irritated me a bit.

  
“They didn’t. Every once in a while Davy J will appear on our screen. It will ask for a seafood dish that we don’t serve. When that happens, anyone who has it on their screen must go hide in the walk-in. No one rings it up, it just appears there.” Henry seemed to be processing what I was saying for a while. Then, he laughed

  
“Oh I see. Nice try but I’m not so gullible.” His smug expression slowly changed to skepticism when he saw how serious I was. “What? You expect me to believe this? I know the new guy should expect to get pranked, but this is just obviously fake.” 
 

“It’s not.” 

I thought I saw his armor of disbelief crack slightly with the piercing matter-of-fact way I responded.

  
“Well what happens to the people who don’t hide?... Nathan looked really traumatized.”

  
I shook my head, “you will most likely experience that in the next couple of weeks while I train you. He comes around every few weeks to torment us. When that happens, do what I say and everything will be fine.” I didn’t know if Henry was actually listening to me or just pretending to. Like I said, most people don’t last here. Many of them leave voluntarily. The rest of them? Well…they tend to just go missing. But they never end up in the news or on the missing persons registry. I know what happened to a few of them. The other’s…I have my suspicions…

  
The rest of the night went off without a hitch. I hope to see Henry tomorrow. I could see him becoming a good addition to the team. But a part of me doesn’t want to see him again because I don’t want anything to happen to him.


After a couple weeks, Henry was doing really well. He was either ignoring or not noticed all the weird things that happen around him. He even talked to our resident ghost, Heather. She’s dressed as a server and will appear every few days and take orders from guests. The issue is, she never rings them up. So when a table tells their actual server that they already ordered from Heather, the servers make up an excuse to take their order again. No one really knows where she came from. If you ask anyone at the restaurant, you’ll get a different story depending on who you ask. Some say she worked here when it first opened in the 90s. They say she was locked in the walk-in freezer and froze to death. Others say she was killed by Dave when she threatened to blackmail him for something or another. While I think it’s possible that Dave could have done that, I think it’s unlikely. Dave is too good at covering his tracks when he commits crimes to be able to be blackmailed. Anyway, Henry didn’t seem to notice after Heather disappeared right when he turned away from her. I watched it happen. He looked confused for a second, shrugged, then walked off.


One thing he couldn't ignore happened the other day though. I felt comfortable enough to leave him on his own while I went to take a piss. That was definitely my mistake, but in my defense, there were no orders on the screen and a lot of the things in the bar are harmless. I knew I messed up when I walked back and saw him staring into the fryer. Even though nothing was dropped in the fryer, it was bubbling and swirling. “Shit,” I muttered to myself as I quickly approached Henry. I talked to him as gently as possible as I grabbed his shoulder, “Heeyyyy Henry, what are you doing?”


He didn’t seem to notice I approached. I was about to say something else when he spoke up. “D-do you hear that?” He said pointing into the churning oil.


I knew what he was talking about, “No…I can’t…what can you hear?” I said slowly. I don’t know what he was hearing, but the look on his face told me it wasn’t great.


“My girlfriend’s voice. It sounds like it’s coming from the fryer.” His eyes seemed unfocused and his voice was monotone.


“What’s it saying?” It seemed like he was too deep into it at this point. I noticed the bubbling grow in intensity.


“She’s saying the oil is cold. Is that true? She keeps saying I have to test it.” I stood next to him. I knew what would come next. I wanted to try to talk him out of it.


“Don’t listen to her Henry. Is she a fry cook? Would she know how hot the oil is? Hell do you even see her around here?” I tried to add that last part to get him to look around. He was too focused on the oil to break his gaze away.


“But she’s so smart, Levi… She would know… I trust her…” As he said that he leaned back, never taking his eyes off the fryer. This was what I was preparing for. As he rocketed forward, aiming his head at the swirling liquid, I slammed into him. He was thrown against the wall and slid down to a sitting position. I stood over him and watched him. Usually that was enough to knock some sense into people, but not always.


I turned to look at the fryer. The swirling was slowly winding down. But before it fizzled out I heard a familiar voice, “next time Levi.”


I turned back to Henry. He was looking up at me as if he had just woken up. His eyes were half closed and his mouth hung open slightly. Suddenly a look of fear washed over his face. “Levi? W-what just happened?” He drew his knees up to his chest and grabbed the sides of his head with his hands. He rocked back and forth slightly. I hated to see him like this. His ignorant bliss was finally stripped from him. “The bubbles…they talked to me. It was my girlfriend, but it wasn’t my girlfriend. I was about to…oh God.” The words spilled out like a waterfall. His rocking grew quicker and his eyes were wild.


I crouched next to him and put my hand firmly on his shoulder. “Henry, breathe.” I started taking deep rhythmic breaths as an example. He began to mimic me as he looked at me. Wet streaks trailed from his red, puffy eyes and down his cheeks. Eventually his shoulders relaxed. We were quiet for a long time. I watched his expression, looking for any sign that he wasn’t ready to talk. He sniffed every once in a while.”The fryer does that sometimes Henry. It will try to talk to you. You need to ignore it. It’s hard because it has a certain…hypnotic pull to it…but you MUST ignore it. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I didn’t think you’d believe me. There are some things in this place that are better to learn from experience. If you choose to come back after this. I will tell you everything that you need to be ready for, because I know you will believe me now.” He had a blank expression as he nodded. I slowly helped him to his feet. At this point a few orders had come in and Jose had taken over my station while he ran his as well. I nodded my thanks as I led Henry to Dave’s office. Dave was going to give him only a few days of paid time off, but I stepped in and made him give him two weeks. I know Dave can handle it with all his shady business dealings. I don’t know if Henry will come back. Part of me hopes he does, but he seemed pretty shook up.
