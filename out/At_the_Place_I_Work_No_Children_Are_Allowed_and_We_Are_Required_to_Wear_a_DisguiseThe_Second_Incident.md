About a month ago, I wrote about the place I work and its unusual rules. I was never interested in sharing anything about it until that horrific incident involving Sandy initially occurred. Documenting my experience has sort of become my new way of coping with what I witnessed.

Things returned to normal after my shift ended that day, and it was as if Sandy had never even come to the store. I felt guilty, considered going to law enforcement, and even wanted to put in my two weeks. However, it didn’t take me long to realize that law enforcement wouldn’t be much help and could actually be more problematic than anything. I’ll let you fill in the blanks.

I tried speaking to Mr. Keys about it, and he was blunt in his responses. When he refused to answer any of my questions, I told him I wanted to quit. He was quick to convince me to stay and offered a 12% increase in my hourly pay. I already receive $33 an hour, and in this economy, I can’t afford to go job hunting for a regular 9-5 that wouldn’t be anywhere near as financially sustainable as this job. Between the potential dangers of continuing my work here as a duster and the inability to pay the bills, I ultimately decided to stay.

As I said, things were quick to go back to normal and remained that way for weeks after the fact. This had me under the impression that everything was going to be alright, so long as I forgot about that one, isolated incident.

That was, until yesterday morning.

I arrived for my shift at 2:55 AM. It only takes a few minutes to get the store ready for opening, so it was going to be just me until 3:25 AM. It was a Wednesday, and I was unsure of who I would be working with at the time.

I got everything in order before flipping the rusty old switch for the barely functioning LED ‘OPEN’ sign hanging in the glass window by the door. It emanates a minor buzzing sound and flickers on and off. Like all electronic things around here, it needs to be replaced, but likely never will be. 

Once the store was open, I decided to get started on dusting.  

As I made my way to the closet full of cleaning supplies in the far back of the store, I felt a sudden pinging in my chest. Even though it’s been a few weeks, and I’ve been back here many times since then, the recollection of Sandy’s cries haunted my thoughts and made me hesitant. For a moment, I wondered if I was really hearing them. I turned my head to face in the direction of the play area, my stomach turning as I couldn’t detach myself from the image of Sandy writhing on the floor like a disoriented child. I shuddered before I was pulled away by the sound of the door jingling as a customer entered.

I adjusted my disguise so I was somewhat presentable and headed for the desk.

“Welcome to the corner palace of knowledge! What will you be reading to- “

Before I could finish my greeting, I realized I didn’t see anyone there. I was confused, as I was sure I had heard the door open. I looked around when I heard a small sneeze.

My heart skipped a beat.

Slowly, I lowered my head and my eyes looked down, past the counter.  

There stood a small child. A little girl. She had bright red cheeks and big, ocean blue eyes.

“Hey- hey, sweetheart. I’m gonna need you to leave the store. You see, no children are allowed.” I said, trying to mask the rising panic in my voice.  

The little girl shook her head.

“I’m serious, you need to leave,” I said more firmly.

The little girl shook her head once more.

I walked around to her, and without skipping a beat, I bent down and hoisted her up off the floor.

She began kicking and flailing about, not making a sound. She was scrunching her face and pouting, but still, she remained silent.

I ignored her physical protests and kept her in my arms as I walked to the entrance.

“I’m sorry, but no children are allowed.” I reinforced this rule as I opened the door and put her down.

She scowled at me when I noticed her eyes darting past me, and her scowl turned into a look of excitement. She formed a wide grin and began waving enthusiastically.

I looked back, wondering if she had come in with a friend, who may have snuck off and is running amok somewhere in the store.

“Stay here,” I said to the girl as I went to investigate.

She shook her head, one last defiance before I locked the door to keep her from coming back in. It may not have been the greatest strategy, but after seeing what happened to Sandy after she broke a rule, I wasn’t ready to take any chances.

I hurriedly scavenged the store, looking for any and every possible hiding spot a child could fit. I called out, trying to make my voice sound as stern and serious as possible. “Come out now, or I will call your parents!” I shouted, more than once. I didn’t want to change my approach; bribery is never a good way of dealing with mischievous kids, because that’s basically showing them, they will always get their way, and I don’t need them returning to the store knowing I will give them stuff to make them go away.

After several minutes, I realized there was one last spot I had neglected to check, whether by mistake or on purpose; the play area.

I wandered to the back, stepping lightly as I feared breaking the silence. I kept having to push up my ill-fitting hat because it hung too low and obstructed my line of sight.

As I turned the corner, I heard what sounded like two plastic objects colliding, nearly causing me to jump out of my skin. I turned to walk in that direction when I heard a small pitter-pattering coming from a distance. I knew the little girl wasn’t inside; there’s no way she could’ve gotten back in after I locked the door.

Certainly, there weren’t more than two kids.

The pitter-pattering grew louder, and the closer it got, the more it didn’t sound like a single pair of feet. I froze where I stood and listened closely. It was the sound of bare hands and feet slapping the floor at a moderate pace. Galloping on all fours.

I instinctively ran in the opposite direction, booking it for the play area. I turned another corner and groped the wall, feeling for the light switch in the dark.

I flipped the switch, turning on the lights in the play area, and as they flickered on, I saw two children sitting with their backs to me. A little girl and a little boy. It looked like they were playing.

I cautiously approached them, trying to ignore how loud my heart was beating in my ears.

The silence was broken by the jingling of the door.

The little boy slowly lifted his head and touched the girl’s arm. She, too, lifted her head, and they ceased their playing. They both stood up, dropping their plastic toys to the ground.

I slightly lowered my head, causing my hat to once again fall over my eyes. I pushed it out of the way to see the two children now facing each other. The boy was holding the girl’s scalp in his hand, running his fingers through the hair as she stood with the top of her head bleeding down her face, a grin of pure anticipation as she watched him fiddle with her scalp. I covered my mouth, biting the fabric of my gloves as I took a step back, then two, then three. The girl lowered her head, and the boy carefully began to put her scalp back on, a grim smile painting his face.

I cringed at the sight, the flesh being stretched and fitted to the little girl’s head. I was sure they knew of my presence, but chose to ignore me. I took advantage of this, as I kept backing out of the area.

Something I noticed about the boy’s face was how uncanny it was. He looked like a child, but his facial features were those of an adult.

When I was completely outside of the play area, I turned and accidentally ran right into someone. I apologized, and quickly realized who it was.

“Oggi!!” I said in a harsh whisper.

“Mr. Duster,” he grumbled.

I pointed behind me, but before I could explain, he put both hands on my shoulders. “You should get back to dusting, boy. Old Oggi knows how to get things sorted out.” He said, walking past me to the play area.

I turned, trying to stop him, but he only seemed annoyed by my attempt. “Go on, Dusty. We’ve got a full day’s worth of work ahead of us, so you need only worry about that. And of course, you remember the rules now, don’t you?” He explained. I could tell under his disguise that he was furrowing his brow and twitching his lip. Bad teeth and unkept facial hair, I would assume.

I nodded. “Y-yes.”

“Well? Repeat them to me so I know you’ll stay out of trouble.” He demanded.

I swallowed.

“Do not let in any children, and remember to wear your disguise.”
