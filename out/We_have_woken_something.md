My name is Adam. Im writing this from my car, I will be dead till morning but I just have to tell someone about what we found. We woke something inside that cave and it killed all of my friends...

&#x200B;

A few hours ago and my friends had an amazing idea to go for a trip to some nearby caves here in the Czech Republic. Of course, we didn't want to pay an entrance fee and it was already after the opening hours. But dump as we are, we still went, intending to sneak inside. We set off at around 10 pm looking to be there at about 11 pm. Only 4 of us went Me, Peter, David and Matyas. We left the others at Matyases weekend house and took off.

&#x200B;

When we got there it was already dark. And because we didn't know if there is going to be someone guarding the place at night we parked the car within about 10-minute walking distance from the entrance. Then we waited till midnight and talked about what are we going to do when we got to the entrance. "Well because I was already here, I know we need something to cut the wire fence to get inside," Matyas told us with a smug tone. "YOU IDIOT!" I and the others screamed at once "You could have told us before we got here!" Peter continued. "How are we supposed to get inside now?" David added. "Don't worry guys I have a backup plan," I said while opening the trunk of my car "Thanks to my job I have this!" I exclaimed while pulling wire cutters out of my bag. "Damm you are ready for everything!" David said while pulling things from my bag. "Don't touch those! I will kill you if you lose something from there" I shrieked at him. "Then that's the plan" Matyas added while playing with the wire cutters. "Let's go then!" Peter shouted at us, already on the path to the entrance. So I grabbed my bag and we went.

&#x200B;

After a few minutes of walking through the woods, we finally saw the entrance at the side of a hill. It had just a wire fence about 3 meters tall around it and a small wooden hut next to the small gate. When we got closer we stopped next to the wooden hut because of the small information panel. "Well this is interesting," I said before I started to read out loud from the information panel. "Read before entering! Step inside the cave only with a guide! If you feel claustrophobic tell your guide! He will escort you out. Listen to your guide instructions! NEVER STEP OUT OF THE TRAIL!" We all laughed a bit. "Well, I see no guide so let's go!" After that, we cut a small hole in the fence with the wire cutters and stepped inside the cave.

&#x200B;

"Well, I don't see shit..." Peter exclaimed and he was right. Even with 3 cheap handheld flashlights, we couldn't see much. All the time we could see something was when one of the flashlights was directly shining at it. "Looks like a time for my trump card," I said while digging inside my bag. "I thought I saw another flashlight in that bag" David answered and he was right I had one, but not one as the others were. "Yea I got this one last Christmas. It s able to shine only for about an hour. But that should be enough." I immediately turned it on and it did the trick. It broke the darkness that was enveloping us. "Oh my GOD, you couldn't use that a few minutes ago ?!" Matyas screamed. We all shared a laugh about it while we moved deeper inside the cave system.

&#x200B;

After 10 minutes of trying not to slip while climbing the old paths and stairs, we arrived at the deepest part of the accessible cave. There was an opening with a wooden platform where the guide would speak to the visitors. "Looks like that's it. We are probably not going to get any lover than this." Peter said while looking around the opening. "Would be so sure about that" David said while climbing the railing around the platform.

He pointed to a small hole in the other side of the cave and said while grinning: "That goes deeper."

&#x200B;

"You are crazy if you think im gonna fit through there," I told David when we got closer to the hole. "Don't worry, im going to see if there even is something on the other side, and then we will work it out," David answered poking his head through the hole. "Guys the cave continues down here I can't even see the end of it" We heard David say, muffled by him trying to crawl through. "And you said that this is it," Matyas told Peter while grinning and trying to force himself through after David. "I still don't think I can get through," I said after all the others got inside. "Don't be a pussy and get in, you need to see this!" I heard muffled from the other side. Not wanting to stay alone in the cave I went after them.

&#x200B;

"Can you at least help me after you stop laughing?!" I screamed at my friends that were having the time of their life watching me trying to crawl through the hole. After they pulled me to the other side and I finally could stand up I picked up my bag and turned my flashlight on all of us were stunned. The cave system was massive down here not the small openings that were up there but one long tunnel going at least a few hundred meters deep.

&#x200B;

After some chatting about the size of this tunnel we moved forward. While walking all of us got quiet, we could feel something was wrong. This place not only didn't look like the other cave we just went through, but it was too perfect like a machine made it but ancient and visibly weathered from time.

&#x200B;

Then the paintings started all around the tunnel, made from mud. They depicted people hunting, building, fighting and everything you would expect from caveman paintings. "There is no way this is real guys," I said, "because if we are looking at what I think we are looking at..." "Yea there is no way nobody found this before us" Peter added. "Umm look at this one," Matyas said, frozen in place while staring at one particular painting. When I came close I knew why he was frozen. I depicted all the humans kneeling to one thing in the middle of them. It looked like a bear but with hands instead of front paws and the head... 4 small eyes in the front and 4 more in the back, no visible snout just two wide grinning mouths with sharp thin teeth in the back and front under the eyes. And two human-like ears with antlers growing above them.

&#x200B;

"Yea this is a joke," David said after a few seconds of silence. "This is meant to scare all the people that go down here." " I don't know man this is just weird, let's go back" I answered. "No way we already got here let's go and see what they are trying to hide from us," David replied, "And you said that the flashlight of yours can shine for at least an hour we are only 24 minutes in so let's move and if we don't find something in 10 minutes than we go back yea ?" I and the others reluctantly agreed and we moved deeper.

&#x200B;

Slowly the paintings of humans become crude as if a child painted them but more and more paintings showed that thing in grave detail. After a few more meters there were no more paintings of humans but only that thing remained with a few new prints of hands and bear-like paws.

&#x200B;

"It's been already 10 minutes let's go back!" Peter yelled. "No man I feel that we are close look!" David replied. Unfortunately, he was right the cave came to a stop with massive wooden doors. "I told you they were just trying to scare us, If not why there would be a door here!" David called victoriously. When we got to the doors he wasn't so sure about it as he was a minute ago. The doors were there but they looked hundreds of years old nearly withered away. "There is light in there turn off the flashlights.." Matyas whispered.

&#x200B;

When the light from our flashlights disappeared we were greeted by darkness as our eyes adjusted we could see the light he was talking about too. A flickering light from somewhere inside the room. Then as all of us were pushing against the door something in the old doors gave away and they fell open with a loud crash. We all froze looking into the darkness that was behind that door. Everybody jumped when we saw movent. That light we saw was now visible. It was a small fire in the middle of the room. Unfortunately, I was the first one to turn on my flashlight and I shouldn't have done that.

&#x200B;

There was a room with wooden walls. With wood and fur scattered all around. In the middle was the fire that we saw and next to it was that thing from the paintings. It was in the middle of waking up from a deep sleep. Instead of running, we could move from fear. Then its eyes opened, those orange eyes. A feeling of dread fell over us like an avalanche. We could see its changing emotions. First confusion, then anger and at last happiness or I think it was something like that because he looked happy to see us, like when you order and your food finally arrives. Then it spoke in some ancient language. Nobody knew what was said but we knew thanks to the tone of it and the deep laugh that it wasn't anything we wanted to hear.

&#x200B;

The first of us to break from the daze was Peter and he booked it the way we came. I tried to run after him with David but the second I started to turn it launched at us. Matyas was the closest to it and with one fast swoop, it crushed his head on the floor and took a big bite out of his right side, tearing his arm and breaking every rib in the way of those hideous teeth. The worst thing wasn't the truth I just lost a friend but that I could hear the sound of every bone snaping and the slashing of all his organs spilling on the floor. Then we ran, I thought a was the slowest runner in existence, but after seeing what has happened to Matyas I ran faster than ever.

With tears in my eyes, I was sure I was going to die.

&#x200B;

At the last second, I saw something on the floor and I jumped over it nearly tripping. Then my blood froze and time slowed down for me, what I just jumped over was Peter, he tripped and was holding his knee. I wanted to help but it was already too late. I heard the most chilling scream when that thing got to him. I didn't even look back, and I continued to run. After another few seconds, I saw David in front of me.

He was trying to get inside the hole we came from, but we were too late.

That thing was already on us. I got hit by its hand and I fell to the ground close to the hole. It wasn't after me, it was after David and took him by the leg that was visible from the hole. It pulled him out and threw him against the wall.

&#x200B;

That thing went for him and started to rip him to shreds. Taking bites and riping parts of him away. I collected myself and weighed my options. I knew im going to die if I stay there, I knew im going to die if I make any sound alerting him that im alive. But knowing that I threw my bag in the darkness trying to distract it and went for the hole. Thankfully it went for the bag. I tried to get through the hole as fast as I could, but there was no way for me to get through fast enough. And I was right, that thing knew I was going to do that and even tho I nearly got through it went for me and hit the wall. I got pinned down by rocks falling I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. Then I got hit by one in the head and everything went black.

&#x200B;

I remember waking up with rocks all around. I pulled myself from the rubble and tried to stand up, but I fell instantly and shrieked with pain. When I looked at my stomach there was enough blood to fill up a pool. I slowly crawled up the path. When I crawled outside I was relieved but I knew Im not gonna live for long.

&#x200B;

Right now it's about 3 am. Im sitting in my car bleeding to death. I don't have the keys to start it, they were inside my bag. I already called help but it will take them at least another hour to get here. I don't think I will live long enough for them to help me. That's why I had to tell my story here. 

Please, don't go inside those caves.

And if we woke it and it's going to leave the cave.

IM SORRY
