I was just a little boy. Just a little boy. I came to a strange town. There I found an old soul. He said "You can stay here little boy, but you must follow our traditions." I didn't know what "traditions" means, for I am but a little boy, just a little boy. The old man called me a dumbass and told me to "think of them as just old rules." The rules are as follows:

\- Don't fart when nobody is around, for they can hear it.

I asked the old soul what he meant by that, since if nobody is around how can "they" hear it\_ Apparently he is referring to a bunch of creepy ghosts. Um, okay??? Moving on...

\- Don't shart when nobody is around, for they can smell it.

Once again I asked the old souls who "they" were, and he slapped me across the head. YEOUWCH. Let's continue.

\- Mama mia / Papa Pia / Baby got the Diarrhea

How is this a rule? It's more like a dumb statement... But I knew better than to question the old soul. He still slapped me tho. Ahhh, next rule.

\- Don't raise the toilet lid, even when peeing and/or shidding

Eugh.

\- Kiss the town's uncle goodnight every night, or else you will DEAD.

Creepy! I wonder how you die. I asked the old soul, but he just said not to ask again. I asked again and he answered. It was so scary that I do not wish to talk about it.

\- Please no loud noises after 10 PM...

Sounds reasonable.

\- ... especially if there are creepy zombies in your home!!!!

Oh dang.

\- If you find a corpse in your bed, try to remember how it got there

Okay I will.

\- If you are awoken by the sound of your mother calling you from the attic, please let her out why is she there in the first place.

My mom loves attics. Eats that shit UP.

\- If you find a cool fishing spot, please invite Kevin

Who is Kevin? The old soul points to a nearby grave. "Kevin is dead???" I asked. "No. Kevin is hiding playfully behind that tombstone." Oh, there he is.

\- If you see a tall ghost, don't look at him in the eyes. He's a retard ghost and he interprets any eye contact directed at him as an invitation to hear him spiel about his stupid ghost day for like half an hour.

Kinda rude to call him a retard, but I understand the sentiment.

\- If you see a short ghost, shit on him.

I wonder what the short ghost did to earn such ire from the town. I asked the old soul, but then I noticed he was both transparent and waist high.

And I had a biiiiig breakfast this morning.
