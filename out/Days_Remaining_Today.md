Time 8:00 AM 

My alarm blared like a scream. Chaos was already brewing in my mind. What is a normal morning routine for most is nothing but for me, when I was brushing my teeth, my reflection began to distort, my eyes turned black as coal in an instant. My skin rippled in the reflection as if something was moving underneath, the foam you spit out, yea that turned into blood. Great right? 

My inner voice was whispering urgently: “Still me... still me... how much longer?” I tried to shake the horror off, telling myself it was just psychosis looming – but the entity’s gentle whisper countered: 

“You’re already mine. Just admit it.” 

I still have aglimmer of hope, there's an appointment this morning that could serve some answers. 10 AM hits as I am sitting in the waiting room at Dr. Lee’s office, her words slaughtered that glimmer with ease: 

“Your condition is accelerating. I’ve never seen anything like this I’m so sorry. You have 7 days before permanent collapse. 

We are exploring possible.... unconventional treatments.” 

My mind reeled – unconventional = desperation = entity’s influence? 

My reality unraveled more and more as the day progressed. My cat, Mr. Whiskers. Never so much as scratched me and I could have sworn his eyes twisted and distorted into something extremely evil. The walls slowly close in on me suffocating each breath. Every noise – clock tick, car horn, whispers – merged with the entity’s voice: 

“Choose me... escape madness... choose me...” 

9:00 PM – Darkness consumed my apartment, mirroring the void within my mind. I lay in bed, paralyzed by fear, as the entity’s whisper grew louder: 

“Tomorrow you will be closer.... sleep tight.... almost mine.” 

 

6 Months Ago... The Last Night of My Sanity 

 

A warm summer evening, filled with love, music, and laughter – my last moment of pure happiness before this madness consumed me. Sarah and I had gone to a concert in the park on the other side of the neighborhood. There were string lights, like you see in those movies with the little town festivals... you know. Anyway, we held each other's hands tight and swayed along with the music. Sarah’s eyes sparkled like diamonds that night – I was invincible with her at my side. It was perfect and should have lasted longer. We went for a walk along the lake after the show, you could see the stars reflecting off the water.... it was beautiful. Sarah leaned her head on my shoulder, and I stopped us so I could hold her like she was the only one that mattered, we were complete. A soft, gentle kiss shared between us made the world melt away completely, in that moment, everything was just perfect. My mind was clear, my heart and soul were full, and the future was bright for both of us. The entity was a distant echo not in my range of hearing just yet. 

Over the coming weeks things seemed normal enough, working, bills, random fun things we could afford to do, but slowly she started to notice things. Mood swings and forgetfulness were just the start, at first, she thought it was just work stress or something, but I knew deep down it was more. This is when the whispers started: 

“You’re not in control... Sarah will leave...” 

The weeks turned into months as her worry deepened. She begged me to get help; I of course resisted, fearing diagnosis would confirm my worst fears. Sarah’s eyes once sparkling with love, now filled with tears and desperation. The night she left was the worst night I have ever experienced.... ever. The entity had driven me to the point it could easily manipulate me, there was an outburts.... I’ve never seen the look of fear I saw in her eyes that night and it crushed me. She whispered through tears: 

“I love you but I’m afraid of what’s happening...” 

My mind screamed her named as she walked out – the entity celebrated: 

“She’s gone. You’re mine now.” 

Without Sarah’s love and light, it didn’t take long for darkness to consume me. I stopped going to work and rapidly isolated myself. Only 6 days left now.... 

8:00 AM  

My mind is a maelstrom of terror. Yesterday’s memories still lingered – Sarah's face, her last words, my descent into madness. The walls seem to breath today, almost like living entities all their own, exhaling cold air. The shadows dance on the floor, taking twisted forms that reach to drag me down into the abyss. Every single noise harmonized with the entity’s voice: 

“We are getting closer. Forever with me starts soon.” 

Hallucinations are bleeding into my days. I swear I saw Sarah in the kitchen, she was whispering my name but when I touched her, she vanished like a cloud of smoke. The other patients in therapy group would appear but their faces are distorted. My own voice argued with the entity sometimes trying to protect me: 

“I’M STILL ME!” vs “YOU”RE ALREADY MINE!” 

I can feel it’s power growing, my body is doing things without my permission and leaving clues for me to find – eerie messages on the mirror: 

“Mine” 

The entity speaks in my voice, answering my own questions with skin tingling responses. Time continues to distort further – hours are minutes and minutes are an eternity. Finally, night is falling on day 6, not that it helps but I made it through another day, right? 

 

9:00 PM  

Darkness swallowed my room, my mind, and my soul. The entity’s whisper is almost a scream: 

“Tomorrow, YOU WILL BE MINE.” 

The scream echoed in my mind as darkness closed in. I felt my sanity unraveling like threads pulled from tapestry. As light slowly crept in the next morning, naturally I found a message on one of the mirrors: 

“Today was my last day fully me” 

 

Day 5 Entity’s Control Tightens 

 

I don’t know what time it is anymore, no point in keeping track. Everything just blurs together anyway. My mind is a puppet now, I still don’t know what it is. Looks like my eyes are black forever now, haven’t seen color in months? My skin is so grey, you could say it was stone. My voice is definitely not mine anymore. My thoughts are the whispers now, the entity demanding loudly and I selintly obey: 

“Rise. Walk. Obey.” 

I was still in there somewhere lost in the dark, faintly echoing: 

“NO. THIS ISN’T ME.” 

I found a picture of Sarah hidden in my room. It didn’t like that, it made me crush and tear it to pieces. The final blow to whatever was left of me. Visions of Sarah flashed in my mind: her face was distorted, eyes black as the pit, and she just repeated: 

“You’re gone” 

Visions of her twisted face haunt me, something inside snapped. You know when you’re at the point of complete exhaustion, there’s nothing left then out of nowhere you get one last burst to cross the finish line? My own voice resurfaced in my head with such extreme it gave me the worst headache I’ve ever experienced, almost as if I was physically tearing my mind out of its control. An explicit challenge was issued in my head: 

“She’ll never love.... what you’ve made me...” 

Its response was immediate and terrifying, my vision blurred and expanded simultaneously. My mind gave one final scream as it tightened its grip – silencing my thoughts. My body contorted in agony as it moved in almost like a body suit, a puppet on strings. The last thing I heard: 

“You are mine now. Completely.” 

Darkness consumed me.
