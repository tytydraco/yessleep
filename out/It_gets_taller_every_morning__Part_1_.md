I live in a town no one visits on purpose. Wind-stripped terraces, paint flaking from window sills, and salt scabs on the brick. The sea’s just close enough to rot everything but not close enough to be scenic. The sort of place where the only new thing is rust.

So when the statue appeared, we noticed.

It was just a bump at first. Right in the centre of the old square near the war memorial—a slight rise in the tarmac, no bigger than a molehill. I passed it on the way to the shops and barely clocked it. But by that evening, you could see it clearly: 

*the curve of a forehead. Pale stone or concrete, maybe. Smooth as old ivory.*

*And two eyes.*

••

They were set deep into the face, not sculpted—wet, too real, too alive. They followed people. That was the worst part. You’d pass by and feel it, like a headache blooming behind the eyes. A pressure. Like being looked at in a dream.

People started talking. First it was a weird prank. Then maybe some modern art from the council, even though no one had approved it. I asked at the bakery. Sheila said it wasn’t there the day before. Mr. Howard from the chip shop swore it had been growing.

*“Statues don’t grow,”* I said.

He just shrugged. *“Tell that to its eyes.”*

By Thursday it had shoulders. Smooth, narrow. The head sat slightly forward, like it was listening to something underground. Still expressionless. No hair. No ears. Just the suggestion of a face. The mouth wasn’t smiling exactly—but there was something there, faint as a smudge on a mirror. Like it knew more than you.

The ground around it was impossible. The council workers brought a pickaxe. It snapped. Even the tarmac cracked around the base like it had given up. A few people tried pouring salt on it. Holy water. One bloke threw vinegar and crucifixes. It didn’t even get dusty.

Then Martin went missing.

He was twelve. Had been daring his mates to spit at the thing. They said he licked its cheek and ran off laughing.

Next morning, gone.

Police put up tape. The local paper ran a headline—***“Mysterious Statue Sparks Panic in Town Centre”***—like that meant anything.

I passed by Friday morning. It was at the waist now. Standing proud in the centre of the square, and somehow… closer to the benches. Not by much. Just enough that you noticed if you’d been looking all week. No one saw it move. It just was.

That night I didn’t sleep well. My dog, Moss, wouldn’t go near the door. He sat in the kitchen, shivering, looking at nothing. I got up to check the locks.

••

There it was.

Not outside. Not in the square.

In my front garden. On the paving stones. The statue.

Same body. Same faint smile. Same eyes. Closer now. Focused on me.

*I didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe.*

The outside light clicked on. It was gone.

I told myself it was a trick of the dark. That I’d imagined it. But the grass where it had stood was flattened. Pressed in with weight, like something had grown up out of the earth and then vanished.

By Sunday, four people were missing. No trace. No sound. No footprints. Just space where someone should have been.

The town council held a meeting. Half the village showed up. The other half were already packing. *“It’s a prank,”* said the mayor, but his voice shook.

Someone asked if it was connected to the disappearances. No one answered.

Monday morning, I saw it again. Outside the newsagent’s. Then again, behind the bus shelter.

And again, at the roundabout by the allotments.

Each time I looked, it wasn’t there.

Each time I turned away—it was.

The smile had deepened. The eyes were sharper. Less like orbs, more like wounds now—watching you with the kind of quiet hunger a spider might feel for a fly still circling the web.

I came home. Closed every curtain. Turned every light on. I keep the telly running so I don’t have to hear the silence.

But every time I blink, I see it in the dark.

*Standing there.*

*Smiling.*

*Waiting.*
