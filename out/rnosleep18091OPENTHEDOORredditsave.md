It's the same. It wasn't a dream.
Fuck.

Okay, so, new day, I prayed last night was all some twisted dream, maybe I took too much melatonin, maybe I read a ducked up Reddit creepypasta, but no, it was real.

God, my throat hurts so damn bad. I was screaming for my family since 6AM, however, I am one lucky son of a gun. My birthday was last week, and I got a whole as box of grape flavored Gatorade ™

Ducking plugin, got this thing when I stared writing, but it's become more of a nuisance as of late, lemme just..

There we go, as I was saying, I have a while as crate of Gatorade and Chips, as well as some Granola bars, and what do you know? Raspberry, my least favorite ones are left, ha!

Who's the weirdo for hoarding food in their bedroom now?


God.. I am, not good at distracting myself. I am so scared
right now, I don't where my family is, what is going on, and why the hell this is happening. I do know one thing though, I am alone, and I don't just mean in my house, it seems the whole neighborhood has gone silent. What used to be mornings filled with the songs of crows and the same group of kids shooting hoops in the driveway has been reduced to and ear piercing silence. That, and all my screaming would have attracted a concerned neighbour.

I'm going to find a way out of here though, mark my words. I just need to get a grasp on what the hell is happening. Serves as a healthy distraction too,I guess.

Time to make those 3 and a half years of Boy Scouts count.
                           ---------INVENTORY----------
• 9 1L bottles of Gatorade (Grape, the best favor)
• 12 Large bags of Chips (Cheesy, yum)
• 4 Raspberry Granola Bars (Best source of nutrients, worst source of enjoyment)
• A survival knife (it even has a nail clipper, how useful..)
•A lighter with half of it's fluid left
•My good ole' pills
• This phone, and a really good charger.

That's what I could gather up for now, I think there's some stuff in the upper closet, but those damn doors won't budge, curse me for never using them.

I'm going to think, that's really the only thing I can do, oddly enough, I have internet, but the phone lines and all that other stuff is dead, but Reddit works, so please just lend me some ideas or tips. I'm signing off for the.. night? Could've sworn it was just day a sec ago.. odd.
