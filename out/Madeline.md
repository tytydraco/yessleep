The weather was awfully quiet. It was the start of the fall season, and we expected winds and the like that anyone would see in Pennsylvania. The news from the past hour reported a strange fog slowly drifting into the town. Said to avoid driving if you can, as it's pretty intense. I'm sitting at my kitchen counter making a cup of coffee; late-night study sessions with my coven have been a drag. Been trying to research a ritual we've been wanting to do for a celebration of life. 



One of our own passed away. Madeline was her name: a vibrant older woman and Elder of the coven. As much of an oxymoron as that was, she brought a liveliness to the group, even down to our local grumpy shaman, Evelyn. Despite Madeline’s air of life to the group, she was also dealing with a sickness. The doctors couldn't figure out what was going on. One day, she was healthy, the next, her curly, bronze-red hair began to fall out of her head. Her skin began to look paper-thin and pale. Eyes getting a bit gaunt, the orbs of amber staring out from them. Her once chubby frame began to thin drastically. She was only 70. Everyone assumed cancer, a tumor, something to cause these symptoms, but any tests the doctors ran were inconclusive. She tried to push through.



Madeline continued to come to our meetings and community events. We tried so hard to convince her to stay back either at the coven home estate we rented or at home, to save her strength. She was extremely stubborn. Evelyn even tried to convince Madeline. That was the kindest we've ever seen Evelyn be to anyone in the group. 



“Please, I'll be okay. I know this is scary, but I swear I'll push through and make it. I even feel better after helping out at the recent coven event,” said Madeline. 



Some of us noticed a slight improvement, but she never said how it was happening. Stopped mentioning any doctor appointments. It was this weird improvement that got some of our sisters relieved, but not Evelyn. Evelyn looked weary. 



She made this one-off comment about Madeline that, “how do you go paper-thin skin to almost pearlescent, it's like she dunked herself into glitter or something, but she looks... too healthy after being so sickly for months.”



I nodded, agreeing that yes, it was weird, but maybe we missed the earlier signs of improvement. Evelyn shook her head at that. Saying that it would be impossible to miss those signs, especially with how bad off she was so many months ago.



How many months was it? It was maybe around 5-6 when she was looking unwell. So sick, so ghastly. Again, perhaps we missed the little subtle changes. It's possible, right? 



One night, about a couple of weeks before Madeline's sudden passing, Evelyn called me. We have each other's numbers for our group WhatsApp for events, birthdays -  the works for such things in our coven. 



“Alexis, it's me, please. You have to listen to me.” Evelyn hissed quietly, sounding as if not trying to get caught by something or someone.



“Evelyn? What happened? Where are you? We didn't see you at the waxing moon ritual?” 



“It's Madeline, something is seriously wrong with Madeline!”



“Slow down, what are you talking about, Evelyn? We just saw her today. She's fine. She looks a little bit better today.” Remembering that now, it gives me this nausea, but I'm not sure why.



“Stop! Stop. I'm not talking about the supposed “sickness” she's not. She's not even human. She's… she's gotta be like a demon or a vampire!?” 



“Evelyn. Listen to yourself. I know we're all just as surprised by the recovery as you are, but where is this coming from?? Madeline wouldn't even hurt a fly!”



“Alexis, you stupid, naive bitch! Are you hearing yourself! How ca-!”



Suddenly, a loud static sound blasted through my phone, like she had gone under a viaduct or accidentally dropped her phone. Within the static, I could hear muffled noises. Screams? Crying? At least that's what it sounded like. The call disconnected. I tried calling Evelyn back, but it kept going to voicemail. Where was she? She didn't even tell me where she was.



“Is everything okay?” Madeline asked.



We were wrapping up the cleanup from the ritual we had finished an hour before. 



“I think so? Evelyn sounded like she hadn't slept in days, saying these weird things about you.” I chuckled, “Like, you aren't human or something, I mean, what kind of person says that about someone who was sick for a while?”



For a moment, I thought I saw a flash of anger cross Madeline's face, but the dim light from the candles might have been playing tricks on my eyes—a sudden chill down my neck. 



“Well, here's hoping she gets some better sleep. You know how she can get when she's absorbed in her studies.” Madeline said softly. She looked wiped, but I left it alone. There's been a lot going on surrounding Madeline's health; we just wanted her to get better. And it looked like it was working.



Evelyn didn't show up until the day Madeline passed. She was quiet. She usually was, but when I got a good look at her, she looked almost like a wax doll. Stiff, but her skin looked shiny, her eyes dead, a doll, but she was alive. Breathing, responding. But her responses were one-word responses, like she couldn't muster up more than that when she heard about Madeline's passing. No reaction. No crying. No questions about what happened. Just a stare. 



Last night during the study session, Evelyn cracked out the last of the rites needed for the celebration of life, two weeks after Madeline's death. Packed up her bag and said she'd see us tomorrow night for us to perform the rites. 



Typical tools. Athame. Goblet, candles, and incense. Everyone was to bring an item that was given to us by Madeline to burn in the communal cauldron for significant rituals. Evelyn offered to make the libation and cakes. The fog was thicker this evening. It was hard making my way to the hovel we called our home together, but I made it. 



She looked different. Softer even. Which is a weird way to describe our quite grumpy hedge witch, but Evelyn looked less frazzled tonight. She poured the libation into the goblet and passed around the cakes to our sisters. From left to right, starting with Evelyn, we drank and ate our cakes. Evelyn was the last to drink. An odd color flickered in her chestnut-colored eyes, as if they became amber like Madeline.



It was the candlelight. No one else noticed. It was just the candlelight. Evelyn is Evelyn. Madeline is dead. She isn't coming back. 



Evelyn softly spoke the rites. Whispering into the cauldron, practically as every one of us places our items inside. 12 items. As we no longer had our 13th member. She poured the last of the libation into the cauldron. Flicker a lit match into the cauldron, and we watched as our keepsakes from Madeline burned and the smoke wisped around us. The smoke was rising. Through the smoke, I could see Evelyn. She changed in shape. No, it's the candles. It's the smoke. It's Evelyn. It's only Evelyn.



Why was I getting paranoid? I felt a tug in my chest. It was like my heart was being pulled down my stomach. I was afraid. Why? This ritual was a celebration of life. A last goodbye. But why didn't it feel like it? I exhaled. I realized I was holding my breath for too long. The ritual ended. We stood in silence for 15 minutes and then sat down. Looking at each other. Everyone but Evelyn and I wore expressions of grief in that dimly lit room. No one noticed the look of terror on my face or the blank expression on Evelyn's as we stared at each other. And then it shifted. Her expression became softer. Like Madeline. Slowly raising her finger to her lips to silence the already panicking thoughts running through my head, she smiled. It was hollow, but left a promise behind it.
