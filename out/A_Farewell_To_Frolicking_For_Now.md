“Just a little further, Dani, we’re almost there.” I reassured my younger sister as I tried my hardest to roll her difficult-to-manoeuvre wheelchair up the steep, hill path. Unfortunately, the wheels kept getting lodged in potholes and caught on branches sticking out of the dirt.

“Lana,” she said weakly. “we don’t have to sit at the peak. We can just have our picnic right here, don’t worry about it.” before she let out a brutal cough and clutched her chest.

Dani. Oh Dani.

Too benign for this world for her own good, and maybe that’s why it’s taking her away from me. Just looking down at her weak, sickly, pale ten-year-old form that’s still reeling from the needles and IV tubes that had been strapped up to her for weeks – I can feel myself choke up.

She used to be so lively, so energetic, so feisty you’d have to tie her to a leash to keep her in one spot. But now look at her. In the span of only one year, this cruel and unforgiving disease has stripped her of her very essence. Now, she can barely stand and with each word she manages to squeak out, she feels aching pain as her lungs feel like their being filled with glass shards.

But she’s held on. She’s a fighter, always has been. As well as an optimist. She says, as soon as she’s all better again, she’s going to become a doctor and research a cure to beat this diseases butt.

But I’m not like her. I’m weak. I don’t stand for anything, and I always assume the worse. That’s why I know that her aspirations will never come to fruition. I know she’s not beating this disease, despite how much I cheer and root for her on the sidelines.

I knew it from the doctor’s grim expression and the proceeding uncontrollable sobbing from my parents after he privately delivered news to them.

I knew it the moment the hospital let her go home with us that she didn’t have long.

The hill we were walking was one me and her raced up-and-down countless times when we were younger. We were so blessed to have moved near it when our dad got a promotion at work and had to relocate.

A hill in the middle of an acre of sunflowers, fit with daisies and a big apple tree at the summit – a sight you’d think to only find in a Disney movie - was just a field away from us. A paradise that belonged to us and only us. Our little getaway to run to when life got stressful.

We were especially lucky to have gone out today, as the clouds had cleared, and the sun seemed to take a liking to us as it showered us in its rays. Despite that, my sister still shivered. An invisible draft absorbed her of all possible warmth she could be feeling in that moment. A chill that was ever present in her soul as its grip on life loosened with each day. A chill no amount of weighted blankets or heaters could dispel.

But I had to try.

“Do you need your blanket, Dani?” I asked, fishing my hand into the backpack I was carrying.

“No, no. I’m fine. Honestly, I’d probably just feel colder if I did have it.” she answered, still quivering.

“Are… are you sure? I just don’t want you to be cold.” My voice began to crack at the seams, as I began to lose my composure.

“Lana. I’m fine, really.” she said, in the best nerves-easing voice she could muster. But I saw right through her act. I knew she was in so much pain and discomfort, that unfortunately no amount of medication and words of pity could fix. It was brave of her to hide such anguish, so I just bit my tongue and stared off into the distance as I gave up attempting to wheel her up the impossible to surmount hill.

The serenity and peacefulness that surrounded us that would usually be calming for me, instead felt like it was drowning me in its silence. It’s hard to explain. I suppose that the knowledge that my sister was feeling none of this peace as a war between her anti-bodies and the invading cancer cells waged on in her bloodstream was enough to make me feel as if I had no right to enjoy the tranquillity, yet here it was trying to force me to.

As I gazed across the vast landscape of perky flowers that stared at me with their hazel irises while a slight breeze tickled their petals, and as hopelessness began to settle within my soul, something caught my eye.

A horse.

Dark, inky, a small black smudge on an otherwise magnificent painting – inlayed a tall, black horse. Despite being miles away, it was hard to ignore as it stood out of place amongst the amber petals that surrounded it. It was a true eyesore, an eyesore that strangely filled me with a bottomless pit of dread as I began feeling queasy at the sight of its stationary form.

“Hey, Dani. You see that horse?” I asked my sister, as I delicately spun her wheelchair around to face the horse’s direction.

Her eyes narrowed as she attempted to spot the sable stallion. “What horse?”

I glanced back up and was just about to point to its location, when I noticed that the horse had vanished. I let out a sigh of disappointment. “Aw, It must have run away. My bad, Dani. If I see it again, I’ll try to point it out quicker.”

She nodded her beanie covered head. “Okay… Can we have our lunch now? I’m really hungry.”

“Sure thing. Let me just find a good spot.”

**\*\*\***

Upon finding a suitable patch of grass to have our lunch on, I took out a red checkered picnic blanket and laid it flat on the ground.

I wheeled my sister over and carefully helped her out of her chair onto the blanket, before we set out a loaf of soft bread and ingredients. We were sat near a slope leading down into an acre of sunflowers, a slope that me and her used to playfully roll down back when she was healthy.

“Did you bring any jam? I can’t seem to find any.” Dani asked meekly as she searched my backpack. It was then I realised I had completely forgotten the jam. It must have slipped my mind while packing as my thoughts were mostly preoccupied with what Dani needed for the trip.

“Oh, damn. I’m sorry, Dani, I forgot. I’m really sorry.” I said in an embarrassed tone.

A leak of sympathy in my stomach that had been dripping with beads of pity, developed into a catastrophic flood of guilt that steadily filled my interior as I choked out further apologies.

A mistake that would seem so minor to others, felt like a rock crushing down on my ribcage. I brought Dani on this trip to make her feel more at ease with her rapidly worsening condition, and yet I couldn’t even roll her up a simple slope or merely remember to bring jam.

“It’s okay, Lana, at least you brought butter. I like butter nearly as much as jam.” she reassured me as she pulled out a tub of butter and peeled the lid open.

She took hold of a butter knife in her pale hands and slid it across the block before spreading it out on a piece of bread. I could tell even this was tiring for her, but I stayed quiet as she clearly wanted to do it herself with no assistance.

***RUSTLE***

I heard the rustling of flowers behind me, as I shifted around and looked down into the jungle of blossoms while my sister continued her efforts in crafting a sandwich. Even from my higher view, I couldn’t see what was making the sound thanks to the overwhelming amount of sunflowers. But I could hear it. I could smell it.

The smell of rot and slurry assaulted my nostrils as the rustling of florets grew closer. It was not just that I heard, as I also heard the ragged, exhausted heaving of an animal accompany it.

Even as the sounds grew closer and closer, and I noticed flowers fall out of view with each crunch of their stem, I could still not spot the animal which was making those noises, despite how close they sounded below.

The stench only assaulted my senses further as it became more potent with each second that passed. I could almost make out another sound before my sister snapped me back to reality and I shifted to meet her curious gaze.

“Sis? You okay?” she asked, holding a sandwich of her own making as the movement suddenly ceased and the smell evaporated.

“Yeah, yeah… did you hear that rustling?” I asked worryingly.

She looked at me puzzled. “No? I didn’t hear any rustling. Oh, but did you smell that lovely scent that filled the air? Smelt sorta like roses and marshmallows, you know? I haven’t smelt those in a loooong time.” she answered cheerfully, just before she chowed down on the soft exterior of her sandwich.

She looked… different. I realised the reason she looked so unfamiliar to me was because of how lively she appeared. Her face was fatter and fuller of colour as a dimpled smile had risen across it. It had been so long since I saw my sister with a grin, that I forgot all about the rustling and the stench, and instead focused on chatting with her while she had a bit of energy.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?” I said as I begun to prep my own sandwich.

“It’s always beautiful here. Gosh, I’m so glad we came, I’ve missed this place.” she stated as she chewed away.

“That’s true. I guess I just forgot how much this place was like a slice of heaven, since it has been a while since I came here. About a year, I think, since you began staying at the hospital.”

She stopped mid bite and looked at me. “You haven’t been here in a year? Why?”

My eyes fell to the ground as I pondered the question in my head, although I found the answer in my heart. “I guess… I guess I just couldn’t go here without you. I mean, it’s our special place, right? We did everything here together. Tag. Camping. Sunflower picking. It just felt wrong to visit with you not by my side.”

She stared at me with fond eyes as she visibly reminisced back to those days. “Heh. Remember when we went frolicking through the flowers, and-”

I cut her off, already knowing what she was going to say. “-And I fell into a deep puddle. Yeah, I remember it well. Especially how cold it was.”

She let out a little giggle, her face blooming with glee. “I don’t know why I found it so funny at the time. Even now just thinking about it, I can barely hold back laughter.”

“I remember you on your back, cackling to yourself as I lifted myself out. I was wearing my favourite shirt at the time, too. I mean, what the heck was a hole that deep doing in the middle of a sunflower field?” I said, unable to stop myself from cracking a smile as Dani chuckled even harder. Soon I found myself laughing alongside her.

When our laughter quelled, Dani’s face took a more relieved expression as she looked at me. “I haven’t seen you smile in a long time.”

This caught me off guard. She was right, of course. But I thought I did a good enough job at hiding my despair when I spent time with her as to not make her feel even more worse. As not to make her feel like it was her fault for my sadness.

Before I could say anything in response, she got to her feet, catching me off guard a second time. She looked at me with a toothy grin. “You know what, Lana?”

“What?” I said, still in awe.

“Maybe we **should** see the hilltop. I mean, I’m feeling a lot better at the moment and I think seeing the apple tree before going home would make us both feel a lot more happier.”

Before I could say anything or object, Dani began jogging uphill in excitement. I didn’t have much time to discuss with her whether she should be doing that sorta stuff, especially as the doctor had recommended that she would need assistance if she ever wanted to walk. But by the time I got to my feet, she was nearly out of view.

Before leaving to follow her, I took one more glance back at where I heard those sounds. I attempted to decipher the faint one I had heard right before my attention was torn away from it by Dani.

Now that I thought about it, it sounded an awful lot like the clacking of hooves.

**\*\*\***

“Woah, Dani, don’t leave me behind now.” I said, exhausted from how difficult It was to keep up with her.

She looked back at me with a mischievous smile. “Heh. Come on now, Lana, you’re only five years older than me. Don’t tell me you’ve gotten old and slow.” She said in a playfully smug tone as she kept her quick pace.

I gestured to an invisible walking stick and hunched my back forward as I began to wave my fist at her.

“Darn it! Get back here, you meddling kid! This is my property, and you will obey its laws!” I shouted in an old man voice, mimicking a neighbour of ours called Mr. Wellers who was a real stickler about his lawn. This got a laugh out of Dani as she slowed her pace down to meet mines.

“Alright, alright, I’ll slow down. Wouldn’t want you to break your back.” she replied, playing along.

We both shared a laugh as we walked side by side, nearing the hilltop as we strolled pass daisies that seemed to bloom due to our presence. Or maybe it was just hers, as her form glowed from the golden light casting down from the sky.

As I watched her frolic up the dirt path and chat with me about topics in which she had struggled to express to me in that depressing, grey hospital room months ago, a weight of hopelessness lifted from my soul and was instead replaced with a more soothing sensation.

**Hope.**

Hope that this was a sign that she had begun a journey of recovery, that the bad days were over and that the future was as bright and blue-skyed as today. That me and her could return to this hill as frequently as we did back when we were younger. That I’d have more time with my sister.

We soon reached the hilltop, and thus, the apple tree. It hadn’t changed one bit from the last time we visited, still towering over us and being plentiful of red, juicy apples.

“Wow.” my sister said as she gazed up at the bushy leaved hair of the tree. She pointed up at an apple that grew from a branch fairly close to the ground, but was still just out of reach for both of us. “Lana, if you let me climb on your shoulders, I’m sure I can reach that apple!”

I thought it over for a second, but ultimately decided it would be a good last action to end this trip on. “Sure, why not.”

I wandered over to where she stood and buckled my knees so she could reach my shoulders and grapple around them. I stumbled a bit once she eventually jumped on my back, not expecting her to weigh as much as she did, as when I was helping her out her wheelchair an hour ago, her body had felt like a bag of twigs.

I stood firmly in place, trying my best not to sway as my sister extended her hand up to the prized apple, when that familiar, horrid stench hit me.

“Oh wow, it smells so good! Just like roses!” my sister stated above me as she continued trying to get a good grasp of the apple, meanwhile I frantically looked around to spot where this smell was coming from. It was just as Dani finally managed to pluck the apple from the branch, that a noise came from behind the tree.

A neigh.

A loud, gurgled one. A breathless, bubbly neigh that startled me so badly it knocked me off balance and I nearly tumbled to the ground with Dani still on my shoulders. Luckily, I managed to regain balance and have Dani dismount my back as the animal made its way from behind the stump and within our view.

The stench became unbearable, tugging at my gag reflex with a crooked hook as a black horse trotted into view. Chunky blood, puss, vomit and other fluids dripped from every open pore on its body, from natural pores to opened wounds. Its eyes had a glossy look, and its mane dripped with grease as it heaved in and out, its exposed windpipe undulating with each choked breath.

It took all my power and some physical restraint not to vomit up all my insides right then and there from the grotesque sight that stood towering over me and Dani. Its silk, rotting skin would shift with each gallop, sliding up and down its muscles as its hooves shook from the lack of meat on them. Yet it managed to stand as it steadily approached us. Neighing.

Dread attacked my nerves with ferocity as I retreated back in fear. But Dani did not have the same reaction as me, in fact, she had quite the opposite.

“Wow. So pretty.” she said, approaching the stallion with zero apprehension or disgust, but rather admiration. The horse continued to close in on her, with Dani lifting her hand to meet its muzzle.

“D-Dani! Get away from that… thing!” I shouted at her, pleading with her to back away from this beast as I felt nothing good could come with interacting with it. But she ignored me, as she awaited to meet the horse’s touch.

I would’ve tried to run and carry her away from the horse, but terror had shackled me to where I stood as my knees locked in place. I couldn’t bare watch as the horses head bobbed mere inches away from Dani’s palm.

What was Dani seeing that I couldn’t?

Being weak, I clenched my eyes shut and I prayed this was some sort of nightmare that I would wake up from. But a part of me also wished it wasn’t. Because if it was, that meant Dani hadn’t actually begun recovering, and that when I woke up, I’d find her sickly form in bed attached to wires as she groaned in pain.

“Hee hee! Good girl!” I heard my sister giggle as I squished my eyelids together. Hazardously, I reopened them to view a strange sight.

Dani was petting the horses muzzle, much to the horse’s visible delight as it lowered its head to make it easier for Dani to stroke its snout. I stared on in confusion, still unable to move from where I stood as Dani continued giggling while grooming the vile mare. I noticed that, with each caress Dani gifted the horses revolting muzzle, no dirt or mucus would coat her hand afterwards.

Then I soon noticed that Dani looked different again. A change that was hard not to notice. Her beanie had fallen off, but instead of showcasing a shaved head, it instead showcased a veil of curly, dirty blonde hair hanging from her crown, seemingly having regrew while I had shut my eyes.

That’s when I got a sense of what was happening. That’s when I knew what the horse was.

I think Dani knew too, as she had a sombre expression on her face as the horse shifted its height lower to the ground, until Dani was able to mount its back.

Tears began to brim from my eyes as realisation struck me like lighting on a thunderous night. “…no. No. No, no, no, no. NO!” I yelled as Dani climbed onto the back of the horse and it regrew to its original scale.

“Please! Please, don’t take her! Not yet, please! Just give us more time, just more time!” I shouted desperately, pleading with an uncaring force of nature to delay the inevitable. Just so I can spend more time with my sister. So I could have more time to say goodbye.

The horse just neighed in response to my begging, uncaring or rather unbiased as it most likely hears the same pleads all the time. Instead, it was Dani who replied.

“I’m so sorry, Lana. I wish I could stay, I really do. I don’t wanna leave you, mommy and daddy. I don’t wanna go. But, it’s not my choice,”

She said, tears streaming down her face just as they did mine. “Just know, that I’m okay with this. I’m just so happy I got to frolic around with you. One last time.”

“Dani…” my voice cracked as I found it impossible to speak from the tears that were flooding my throat.

“Bye, sis. For now, at least.”

The horse neighed, and began to gallop down the side of the hill, keeping its balance perfectly as it descended the steep inclines.

Pass the daisies. Pass the wheelchair. Pass the picnic blanket. And soon into the sunflower field as the sun plummeted. All the while my sister clung to its back.

And then,

my sister was gone.
