I don’t know if this was real or if my mind is breaking, but if anyone else in South Fulton, Georgia saw what happened on Hawthorne Street last night… please, for the love of God, say something. I need to know I’m not crazy. I need to know I didn’t let something in that shouldn’t be here.

It started at 2:37 AM.

I know because I couldn’t sleep—again. My mind’s been restless for months, but last night felt different. Heavy. Like something was pressing on my chest from the inside.

The house was dead quiet. My wife was asleep upstairs, and the baby monitor crackled with the soft buzz of our daughter’s breathing. I was downstairs on the couch, doom-scrolling Reddit, like I always do when the insomnia gets bad. That’s when I heard it.

BANG BANG BANG

“LET ME IN! LET ME IN!!”

It wasn’t just banging. It was panic. The voice cracked, screamed, clawed at the silence. I shot up, heart already racing, and peeked through the front blinds.

There was a man—Black, maybe in his late 20s, barefoot, shirt soaked in sweat or blood, I couldn’t tell. His eyes were wide like he was watching something behind him. Something I couldn’t see.

He was banging on the neighbor’s door at first. Then ours.

“LET ME IN, PLEASE!! THEY COMIN’, MAN—THEY COMIN’!”

That’s when I heard them.

The whispers.

Faint at first. Like leaves brushing across concrete. But then they started echoing. Around the porch. Around the walls. Inside my head.

I stepped back. I know how it sounds, but I swear to God they weren’t coming from the street.

They were coming from inside the house.

I moved toward the front door, but then he stopped. Dead still. Then, without warning, he bolted off the front porch like he was being yanked by an invisible hook.

I ran to the kitchen window. He was sprinting around the side of the house toward the back, feet slapping wet concrete. Then—

BANG BANG BANG BANG

“LET ME IN, BRO!! PLEASE, PLEASE, LET ME IN!!!”

His fists were pounding the back door now. I couldn’t see his face clearly, but his voice—it didn’t sound human anymore. It was deeper, trembling, like a chorus of voices trying to speak at once. Like whatever he was running from had followed him into his throat.

Then came the silence.

Ten seconds.

Ten whole seconds where everything went dead. Even the cicadas stopped.

I stared through the back door window. The man stood still, hand pressed flat against the glass. His mouth moved, but no sound came out. His eyes stared through me.

Then—

BOOM

The door exploded inward like it had been hit with a battering ram. He flew inside and slammed the door behind him.

He turned, eyes wide, nostrils flaring like an animal.

“Did you lock it?” he whispered.

“What?”

“Did you lock the goddamn door?!”

I nodded.

He backed into the kitchen, breathing like a dog that had been running for miles.

“What the hell is going on?” I asked.

He didn’t answer. He stared at the hallway behind me. My spine turned to ice.

“There’s something outside,” he whispered. “But it don’t knock unless it wanna be let in.”

I turned slowly.

Nothing.

Then I heard my daughter’s baby monitor click on upstairs. And someone—no, something—said softly:

“Let me in.”
—————————————————-
They always told me not to come back.

My mama said the South holds onto spirits like a grudge. That once you leave and try to return, something follows you. I thought it was just superstition. Old head talk. But that was before I came back to bury my brother.

My name’s Terrance. I’m 29. Born in East Point, raised on stories about shadow-men, “root work,” and mouths that whisper things in the woods at night. I ain’t believe none of it. Not until I came back home last week. Not until I saw him.

Derrick.

That was my twin. Two minutes older than me. Used to say we were born under a bad moon because weird stuff always happened around us. But after we turned 13, it all stopped. Or maybe… we stopped seeing it.

He died two days after I landed in Atlanta. Car accident, they said. Open-casket wasn’t possible.

But the crazy thing is… the cops said they never found the car.

Or his phone.

Or his shadow.

Yeah. They said that. Like it meant something.

I tried to stay with my Auntie Joy, but her house was cold—not temperature cold. It felt like grief lived in the drywall. Like someone was watching me every time I walked by a mirror. I started hearing whispers from under the sink. From behind the fridge. And always the same voice:

“You left. You left him here.”

I thought it was guilt. Until I saw the man outside her backyard last night.

He was wearing my brother’s shirt. Only… it wasn’t Derrick.

It had his eyes—but they were sunken. Too wide. Like they’d been yanked open and couldn’t blink anymore. And his mouth kept repeating the same thing:

“Let me in.”

I ran. No car. No phone. Just sprinted barefoot down side streets, slamming on doors like a crazy person. But every house was dark. Dead. Like nobody had lived there for years, even though I knew some of those porches had folks barbecuing two days ago.

And then I hit Hawthorne Street.

My feet were bleeding. My body shaking. But the whispers were louder now. They weren’t just behind me anymore.

They were inside me.

Telling me things. Showing me images.

My brother in the grave, but smiling.

A white door in a black room.

A baby crying inside a mirror.

I saw a man in a house with all the lights off. He was watching me. Judging me. And somehow—I knew he could hear the whispers too.

I don’t know why I picked his house. Maybe something pulled me there. Maybe he was part of this.

But as I banged on the door, screaming to be let in… I felt it.

Something brushing against the back of my neck.

Not wind.

Not rain.

Something like fingers made of static and sorrow.

I ran around back. Begged. Screamed. Waited.

Then the whispers stopped.

And I felt my brother’s breath on my neck.

That’s when the door opened.

Terrance was in my kitchen, pacing like a caged dog, muttering things I couldn’t catch. My wife was still upstairs. I hadn’t even called the cops yet. Something about this didn’t feel… real.

He looked at me like he knew me. Like he’d seen me in a dream or something.

“They marked you,” he said. “They do that when you open the door.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked.

He pointed to the hallway.

“They’re already inside. Been inside. Since the moment you heard ‘em.”

I turned toward the hallway again. That damn baby monitor clicked on again. But this time, I didn’t hear breathing.

I heard chewing.

Wet, slow chewing. Like someone was eating something soft and alive.

I bolted up the stairs two at a time. My daughter was crying. But not a normal baby cry. It was muffled, like someone had their hand over her mouth.

When I flung the door open, she was alone.

But her closet door was open.

And inside… was a second baby monitor.

Not ours.

I ran back down to Terrance. “Why are you here? Why my house?”

He looked up with eyes like cracked glass.

“I didn’t choose your house, bro. They did.”

He said the whispers find people with doubt in them. People who’ve seen death. People whose grief makes holes big enough to crawl through.

“I let my brother die,” he said, shaking. “And you… you’ve been scared ever since that night you almost crashed with your daughter in the car. Right?”

I froze.

No one knew that. Not even my wife. Not even my therapist.

“How do you know that?”

He didn’t answer.

Because the lights went out.

The power.

All at once.

And the only light in the room came from the hallway—beneath the basement door.

A glowing white light spilled out like moonlight on milk.

And then, knock-knock.

Two knocks.

But this time, not at the front. Or back.

It came from under the basement door.

And the voice that followed wasn’t human.

“Let me in.”

Terrance grabbed my arm.

“You can’t open it.”

I wanted to believe him.

But the light was pulling at me. Like it knew me.

I stepped forward, but the house groaned—the walls literally bent inward, like they were breathing.

Terrance held me back. “They’re not ghosts. They’re not demons. They’re something else. Something older.”

He said the name.

“The Cold Choir.”

He told me they’re like a sickness that only spreads through sound. They infect through whispers. They knock, but only on doors where trauma lives. They trick you into letting them in—and then, you forget you ever did.

Because they don’t want your house.

They want your memories.

“They erase you by making people remember you wrong,” Terrance whispered. “Like Derrick… I don’t even know if he’s real anymore. I don’t know if I’m real.”

That’s when I looked at the family photo on our wall.

My daughter’s face was blurred out.

Like it never existed.

The basement door exploded open like it was paper.

White fog rolled out—silent and cold—and in it stood Derrick.

But he wasn’t breathing.

He was moving, yes, twitching like a puppet—but not breathing.

His mouth was sewn shut with hair. His fingers were too long, each one pointing at both of us at once.

And when he opened his stitched lips, a thousand voices poured out.

“LET US IN.”

Terrance screamed.

I froze.

But my daughter? She was behind me now, crawling.

Toward the fog.

Whispers filled the room, crawling across the floor like snakes.

And then—Terrance tackled me.

“You already let them in, man. We’re already too late.”

This is where the truth breaks everything.

Terrance and I are in the living room. Windows cracking. Walls caving. My daughter’s skin turning pale like paper.

Then the whispers stop.

And a second me walks in through the front door.

Same face. Same clothes.

Only… his eyes are black.

He walks over to my daughter.

And she goes with him. Willingly.

“Stop!” I yell. “That’s not me!”

Terrance pulls out a phone—an old flip phone. The one his brother had.

He plays a voicemail.

It’s me. Screaming.

“LET ME IN. OH GOD. LET ME—”

And then the twist hits me.

I was the man outside the house.

That night I almost crashed the car with my daughter… I did crash. I died.

Everything since then—the house, my wife, my kid—it’s been their version of my life.

They let me believe I was alive.

Because I let them in.

And Terrance?

He never existed.

He was my guilt, wearing a familiar face. A memory patched together to keep the lie going.

As I look into the mirror on the wall, I don’t see me anymore.

I see them.

And now I’m the one outside the door of someone else’s house.

Banging.

Screaming.

“LET ME IN. LET ME IN. PLEASE—”

But they never will.

Because they already did.
